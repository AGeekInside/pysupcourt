Bazzle.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nFirst in Volt and then again last term in Waffle\nHouse this Court made clear that, quote, arbitration under\nthe Federal Arbitration Act is a matter of consent, not\ncoercion. It is that core Federal principle that was\nviolated by the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Phillips, now, the contract\npresumably can be interpreted in accordance with the law\nof the State with jurisdiction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, to be sure, Justice O'Connor,\nbut this contract was not interpreted in accordance with\nthe understanding of the parties, with -- with respect to\nthe parties. Ultimately, you have to look for the\nparties' consent to this kind of an agreement, and what\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court was quite clear about --\nQUESTION: Well, there was no express provision\nin the arbitration agreement saying that you can't have\nclass-wide arbitration.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, there was no express\nprovision to that effect, but if you look at the South\nCarolina Supreme Court's decision in this case what it\nsays is, first, the parties were absolutely silent with\nrespect to class arbitration. That's not surprising.\nI've never read a class arbitration clause in any\ncontract, and I'm told that no one's ever even attempted\nto draft a class arbitration clause.\nBut second of all, the -- the court went further\nthan that and said what was going to inform its judgment\nabout how to interpret or how to apply this particular\nsituation, it wasn't anything with respect to the language\nor understanding of the parties.\nany contractual directive whatsoever, stated twice, the\ncourt simply coerced Green Tree to defend a class\narbitration proceeding.\nQUESTION: Well, but the --\nQUESTION: Well, how does that -- how does\ndiffer from Volt, Mr. Phillips? There, the contract\ndidn't say anything about the court staying the\narbitration, and yet we said in our opinion that that was\na permissible thing for a -- that once the law of\nCalifornia had been invoked, that was a permissible thing\nto be done.\nMR. PHILLIPS: In -- the difference between this\ncase and Volt, Mr. Chief Justice, is there the parties\nagreed that the arbitration itself would be controlled\nsolely by California law. That was the consent of the\nparties.\nQUESTION: Well, they said the place where the\nconstruction was -- was taken.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and that was understood by\nthis Court, and by the lower courts as a matter of State\nlaw, to embrace California law.\nQUESTION: But didn't -- didn't the -- didn't\nthe agreement here say it would be governed by the law of\nSouth Carolina?\nMR. PHILLIPS:\ngoverned by South Carolina law, but the arbitration\nprovision itself is governed exclusively by the Federal\nArbitration Act.\nQUESTION: Well, is your -- your argument that\nif the South Carolina court is unreasonable in\ninterpreting State law, then it comes up here? I -- I\njust don't understand how we get this -- this question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me there are two ways\nyou can get to this question. In this case, there was no\neffort by South Carolina Supreme Court to apply South\nCarolina law. What they did -- they're not looking for\nthe consent of the parties. They're looking to coerce a\nresult based on their view of efficiency and equity which\ninvolves the interests of completely third parties to\nthis -- to this situation, not the parties to this\nparticular agreement. If --\nQUESTION: Why do you -- I'm sorry, I thought\nyou were done.\nMR. PHILLIPS: If, in fact, South Carolina had\npurported -- if the South Carolina Supreme Court had\npurported to try to interpret this agreement as in some\nsense reflecting a -- a consent by the parties to a\nclass-based arbitration it would be a much, much closer\ncase.\nQUESTION: Well, what --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's not the standard that the\ncourt applied here.\nQUESTION: What if the South Carolina court in a\nsomewhat different case had said this arbitration is going\nto be governed by our State rules of discovery. The\nparties have said nothing about it, but they just say, if\nyou're going to be bound by the laws of South Carolina,\nthat's what you're going to do. Is that bad?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, that's not bad at all,\nMr. Chief Justice. The difference between that, of\ncourse, is that is what you expect when you -- when you\nconsent to a bilateral arbitration arrangement. When you\nsay, we're going to proceed to resolve this dispute in an\nefficient and economical fashion, you understand that that\nmeans arbitration, however the -- however that gets played\nout and, indeed, generally speaking, you would expect that\nto be a question for the arbitrator, more than you might\nas a matter of State law.\nThe difference here, of course, is we're talking\nabout making a decision that's binding, or at least\npurports to be binding on literally thousands of other\nindividuals who are not parties to this agreement, and\nthis goes --\nQUESTION: And who are not -- and who are not\nobjecting so far as I know.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nQUESTION: Green Tree is the one who's\nobjecting.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we don't know whether they\nobjected or not. All we know is that they received notice\nand took no action as a consequence of it, but --\nQUESTION: Why -- please.\nMR. PHILLIPS: If you -- if you flip this case\naround, in this situation, where the -- where the unnamed\nmembers potentially are going to receive $5,000 to $7,500\nof windfall recoveries, my guess is they're not going to\nobject, but what if the case had gone the other way. What\nif the arbitrator had issued a $1 nominal damage award for\neach member of this class. Does anyone seriously doubt\nthat the next day any of those unnamed class members could\nshow up and say, excuse me, I have a right under my\ncontract to choose my arbitrator in an agreement between\nmyself --\nQUESTION: Yes. Yes, one might doubt it if\ntheir claim was worth $2, and it would cost them more to\ngo into court to make the objection. The -- the class\naction vehicle in some cases will make an action possible\nthat wouldn't be brought before an arbitrator before.\nThe --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Can I -- can I respond to that,\nJustice Ginsburg, because you see, it seems to me that\nthat simply reflects the manifest hostility to the\narbitration agreement as it's been -- as it's been written\nby the parties here.\nI mean, basically what we're talking about is,\nwe have a dispute. It involves what will largely be a few\nthousand dollars, potentially. I mean, the entire\ncontract here involved $15,000 of -- in one case and\n$7,500. You expect the disputes are going to be\nrelatively small, and you expect that the parties are\ngoing to choose an efficient method of trying to resolve\nthose cases and move on, and -- and they waive their right\nto a public, or judicial review, because the theory is,\nwin or lose, it's worth taking the risk.\nWhen you take that kind of a situation and you\nconvert it into a $27 million fine, nobody would agree to\nthat ab initio.\nQUESTION: Do you --\nQUESTION: That's true. That's true, but what's\nbothering me is exactly this point. I can understand your\nargument to this point. A State, I don't think could\npossibly, consistent with section 2, interpret the word\narbitration in a contract to contain all the bells and\nwhistles of a court proceeding, because that would\ntransform the arbitration into a court proceeding, and\ntherefore they would have, in this subtle way, not only\nhave shown hostility to but destroyed the arbitration\ncontract, but what about this one. Is this hostile to\narbitration?\nI have no doubt that Green Tree wouldn't have\nagreed, in all likelihood, had they known what was going\nto happen, and to that extent it is hostile to\narbitration, but the consumers on the other side might\nhave said, oh, we rather like it, in which case from their\npoint of view it isn't hostile to arbitration, so sort of\nfrom one side it is, and from the other side it isn't, and\nhow do we decide whether, overall, it is or it isn't?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that the linchpin\ntheory of the case ought to be the -- the point I started\nwith, Justice Breyer, which is, you look to determine\nwhether there is the consent of the parties or whether --\nQUESTION: No, but what we don't know here is\nwhether there is or there isn't. We have silence, and\nlike many contracts that are silent, you have to impute an\nintent, and what South Carolina did is --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, what South Carolina did --\nQUESTION: -- is, they imputed an intent.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- they imputed an intent.\nQUESTION:\nthat since the other parties in our minds would have\njumped for joy, and you, your client would have weeped in\ndismay, we in that situation interpret the contract\nagainst the drafter, which happened to be your client, so\nthey chose the other side and thereby concluded that it\nwas not hostile to arbitration, though it wasn't in the\ninterest of one of the parties.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it also doesn't reflect the\nconsent of both of the parties.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Both parties have to consent,\nJustice Breyer. That's the nature of consent.\nQUESTION: You -- you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: You simply can't have unilateral\nconsent.\nQUESTION: The reason, as I understand it -- the\nreason, as I understand it, you say there isn't consent\nwas the reason you gave in your answer to the Chief\nJustice, that, in fact, they had agreed to be bound by\nSouth Carolina law with respect to the interpretation of\nthe contract, but not with respect to the arbitration\nclause itself, and my question is, how do you draw that\nline? There's nothing, per se, inconsistent between\napplying the FAA and applying some State law. That has to\nbe done.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nQUESTION: So why do you draw --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- South Carolina Supreme Court\ndrew that line. The South Carolina Supreme Court\nspecifically held that the parties agreed that the\narbitration clause would be governed exclusively by the\nFederal Arbitration Act, and the --\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, you say governed\nexclusively by the FAA, in the sense that the FAA\nnaturally is going to trump any inconsistency with State\nlaw, but here, there isn't a clear inconsistency with\nState law, and the FAA is always applied with some State\nlaw in mind. You have to have some procedure, and so on,\nand -- and therefore I -- I don't know how you can draw\nthis nonporous line between the FAA and arbitration on one\nhand and State law on the other.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two ways to get\nthere. First of all, as a matter of just South Carolina\nlaw we know that South Carolina's arbitration provisions\ncompletely go by the wayside as a matter of State law.\nMunoz held that several years ago. If the FAA applies,\nthere is no State law that is residual to it. It is\ndetermined by the Federal Arbitration Act, which means\nthat the arbitrator is going to make certain kinds of\ndecisions.\nBut the -- I think the key line here is that\narbitrators are absolutely free to fashion whatever rules\nthey think are appropriate for resolving disputes in a\nbilateral situation. The question is, where does the\narbitrator get the authority to reach out to literally\nthousands of other parties in order to resolve their\nrights?\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, first, you're not --\nyou're not urging that there's any inherent inconsistency\nbetween the arbitration and class action. You concede in\nyour brief, I think, that if the parties agreed, yes, you\ncould have a class action in arbitration.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, although, Justice Ginsburg,\nthere is not a single example that I could identify of any\nparties ever agreeing to go into a class action through\narbitration.\nQUESTION: Have there been no class actions\nin -- in arbitration?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Have there been no class actions\nin --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Other than this one?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There are in California, but\nthat's -- that's it.\nthe only places, and the reason is, is that what you\ncreate is this extraordinarily hideous hybrid kind of a\nproceeding.\nQUESTION: Does the AAA have no rules about --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nQUESTION: -- class actions? It's just\nsilent --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Not as far as I know. I mean,\nthey didn't file a brief in this case, but as far as I\nknow AAA doesn't have rules specifically dealing with it.\nThey find it to be, as I understand it, quite burdensome\nto try to figure out how to deal with it. If you think\nabout it, this -- you're -- you're taking a dispute that\nby its nature is supposed to involve a few thousand\ndollars, converting it into $27 million. The costs in\nthis case alone --\nQUESTION: Well, suppose --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- were $36,000.\nQUESTION: If the parties had chosen, say, a New\nYork forum -- I thought an arbitration agreement is\nsupposed to be a forum for action laws.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's part of it.\nQUESTION: If they said nothing about class\naction and they chose New York as a forum, New York has a\nclass action vehicle.\ncould get a class action, is that not so?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, the difficulty with\nthat is that there's -- there's no State law in general --\nI mean, there are no statutes out there that provide for\nclass actions with respect to arbitrations. That's why\nthis is a hostile --\nQUESTION: But it -- it -- then arbitration is\nsomething other than a mere choice of forum, because --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, absolutely. The Federal\nArbitration Act creates a substantive law of\narbitrability. To be sure, it incorporates and embraces\ndecisionmaking by the arbitrator. It recognizes some\nlimited role in some circumstances for State law, although\nagain South Carolina doesn't do that, but there -- there\nis nothing that provides a mechanism for converting your\nordinary bilateral --\nQUESTION: Can I -- can I interrupt with this\nquestion, Mr. Phillips? Supposing you had the -- Green\nTree had agreements with a large -- large number of\nconsumers, and suppose 15 of them filed separate\narbitrations, they all went before the same arbitrator.\nCould the arbitrator have entered an order saying, I think\nit would be efficient to have all these cases tried\ntogether, so I'm going to enter an order requiring you to\ndo so?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think if the parties all\nagreed to have it resolved by the same arbitrator --\nQUESTION: Well, supposing the -- supposing\nGreen Tree objects. Could he nevertheless do it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I think in that situation\nwhat you're then doing is depriving us of our right under\nthose agreements to choose our own arbitrator.\nQUESTION: Oh, but here -- here the South\nCarolina arbitrator, which you -- you certainly consented\nto his appointment, went ahead and did pretty much this.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nQUESTION: Not -- not as sweeping --\nMR. PHILLIPS: This in a vengeance, I will say,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, but what is your -- what is\nyour principle objection to Justice Stevens' hypothetical\nwhere the arbitrator simply says, I've got 15 of these and\nI'm going to just try them together?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I have a substantial --\nsubstantially less of an objection to that kind of a\nprocedure because it doesn't adjudicate unnamed parties'\nrights, or purport to adjudicate those rights. At least\nyou have a real dispute that already exists --\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. PHILLIPS:\nsense consolidation. I still think you have to respect\nGreen Tree's right --\nQUESTION: But then -- but you say your -- your\nobjection would have been cured if the arbitrator had\nwritten a letter to every plaintiff and gotten an -- a\nwritten okay, that would have made it okay?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, because the -- the\narbitration process requires the filing of claims and\ngoing through it.\nQUESTION: Well then, what's the difference\nbetween that and my 15-individual case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because we don't know whether\nthere is, in fact, a dispute between the parties in the\nabsence of some effort by the plaintiffs to come forward.\nQUESTION: Well, they know there's a common\nissue in all these cases -- I mean, they -- they all had\nthe same legal issue involved, didn't they?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but it -- just because you\nmay have a right doesn't mean you necessarily care to\nassert your right. Again, it's -- it's easy to look at\nthis case and say, well, gee, there's an opportunity to\npick up $5,000 in windfall, or $7,500 in windfall, but you\nknow, an arbitrator could just as easily have rendered a\ndecision here that said, this is a pure technicality, it's\nentitled to $1 in nominal damages, and the class-wide\nrelief ought to be $1,900, and attorney's fees ought to be\na third of that, which is $600 --\nQUESTION: And -- and --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and I guarantee you they would\nnot be willing or prepared to -- I'm sorry, Justice\nKennedy.\nQUESTION: Please, finish your answer.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They would not be prepared to\nabide by that. Every one of the unnamed members would\nsay, I never had an opportunity to -- to participate in\nthe selection of the arbitrator who has resolved my\nsubstantial rights. There's no basis at all to bind me\nunder these circumstances, and I'm going to show up and\nmake a claim.\nQUESTION: Well, the obvious solution to that\nwould be to read into their contract the idea that they\nhad agreed to that situation provided they're fairly\nrepresented, et cetera, and if they don't like the result,\nthey can arbitrate that, too.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But see, Justice Breyer, we -- we\nkeep making up more and more and more, and none of this\nis -- is at all linked to any kind of consent among any of\nthese parties.\nQUESTION: I want to ask about consent. At what\npoint and how did you first object to the class action?\nDid -- did you instruct the arbitrator that we consented\nto your appointment for individuals A, B, and C, but not\nfor other --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nQUESTION: We -- we do not consent.\nMR. PHILLIPS: We do not consent to that.\nQUESTION: And when did you do that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: We raised that as --\nQUESTION: After the first --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- as early and often --\nQUESTION: -- the idea of class action.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, and the South Carolina\nSupreme Court specifically addressed the question of\nwaiver and found that we never waived our right with\nrespect to that.\nQUESTION: But you did select the arbitrator.\nIt was your arbitrator.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It was our arbitrator with\nrespect to the dispute with the Bazzles and the Lackeys\nand the Buggses, to be sure, but we did not agree to an\narbitrator to resolve any disputes involving unnamed third\nparties --\nQUESTION: Well, it leaves this open, and I\nmean, I agree with you that it is -- whether you did --\nwhether this or is not the proper interpretation of what\nthe parties intended is certainly disputable, and if it's\ndisputable, why shouldn't the arbitrator decide that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: See, I don't think it is disputed\nwhat the parties -- what the parties intended, Justice\nBreyer.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, wait. You -- I'm going\nto hear in about 10 minutes or so a pretty good argument\nthe other side, too --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Except that --\nQUESTION: -- so that my question is, where you\nhave a contract that says, interpretations of the\ncontractor should be arbitrated, and where, in fact, what\nwe're arguing about today is how one part of the contract\nshould be interpreted, how did we get here? Why wasn't\nthat referred to the arbitrator?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the question of whether\nthe arbitrator has the authority to resolve the rights of\nunnamed third parties is not a question for the arbitrator\nto decide. That's a question for the court to decide.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because it goes --\nQUESTION: I would have thought the meaning of\na --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It goes to the core of the\narbitrator's jurisdiction and authority to decide.\nQUESTION: No, but wait. There is a case,\nincluding one I just wrote, I think, for the Court which\nmakes very clear that what you send to the arbitrator -- I\nmean, there are dozens of cases where you have a phrase in\na contract, and that's in dispute, and the parties have\nagreed we send disputes about the meaning of the contract\nto arbitration, you send that to the arbitrator.\nI mean, the only things that you don't are\nwhether there's the arbitration contract is itself valid,\net cetera.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I think on the\nquestion of whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and authority to decide the\nrights of a party, that is a question for the court to\ndecide --\nQUESTION: Okay, is there any -- is there any --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- not for the arbitrator.\nQUESTION: Is there any case you could cite -- I\nmean, I read most of them when I -- when I wrote the\nopinion in the Howsam case. I don't think you can think\nof one.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But Howsam dealt with the\nspecific problem of the procedures to be followed with\nrespect to a bilateral --\nQUESTION: Oh, are we talking about that here?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, we're not talking about the\nprocedures to be followed in a bilateral agreement. We're\ntalking about what you have to do --\nQUESTION: Well, I --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- to resolve the rights of third\nparties who are not signatories --\nQUESTION: Why should --\nQUESTION: At least as to the other contracts --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- the ones that get sucked into this\nmassive litigation, it is certainly a jurisdictional\nissue --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That -- that's my point, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: -- if not as to yours. Yours, you --\nyou agree to the arbitrator and whatnot, but -- but\ntake -- take somebody else who --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And anything the arbitrator did\nto us --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry, I don't understand the\nmeaning of when you say it's a jurisdictional issue, when\nyou agree to somebody else's statement it's a\njurisdictional issue. What I have in front of me is a\ncontract.\narbitrated, there is a question, what does that mean, that\nword arbitration in this contract, and then I know that\nthe parties have agreed to arbitrate the meaning of the\ndispute, all right -- of any phrase --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but --\nQUESTION: -- including that one.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: So -- so how did we suddenly get into\ncourt, was my question?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because, Justice Breyer, the --\nthe contract says that -- that it binds us and you, and us\nand you are defined as Green Tree and the -- and the\nspecific named participants in this proceeding. It\ndoesn't say word one about the rights of all of the other\nindividuals in this --\nQUESTION: But the other individuals --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and the South Carolina -- I'm\nsorry.\nQUESTION: The other individuals are not here\ncomplaining. I mean, they're probably glad they got\nthe 7,000 bucks --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, they're not here complaining\ntoday, but Mr. Chief Justice, you're going to have to\nresolve the question of whether or not you can interpret\nan arbitration agreement in a way that allows these kinds\nof proceedings for the -- for the generality of cases, and\nwhat do we --\nQUESTION: If you're concerned about the third\nparties, how does it differ from a court-declared class\naction where the safeguards are the class members have\nnotice, and there's a notice here that is clearer than\nmost notices, and if they're -- if they say that they were\ninadequately represented, they could collateral attack on\nthat basis. Why should those States' laws be any\ndifferent in an arbitral forum than in a court forum?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you were going to allow\na class action in an arbitral forum you would certainly\nwant those -- those protections to be built in. My point\nis, is that the way you get those kinds of protections to\nexist in the ordinary class action is because the State\ncoerces the litigation. The ordinary rule is that you\ncannot represent third parties, and the court has\nidentified as a matter of its power situations in which\nit's going to embrace that approach, but that doesn't get\nyou past the contract problem.\nQUESTION: But the court can't do it as it --\nthe Federal rules have a class action provision --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and the Federal rules can't affect\nsubstantive rights, only procedure, so the class action\ndevice, classes are certified every day in -- in Federal\ncourt --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But --\nQUESTION: -- and they're not changing the\nsubstance of any contract that they're declaring in a\ncontract setting, a class action.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the difference there,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that here we're talking about a\nsituation where the full authority of the arbitrator is\ndefined by the consent of the specific parties to the\nagreement, and these parties don't have the authority to\nbind nonparties. The Court said just last term in\nWaffle House --\nQUESTION: They're not in court by reason of a\ncontract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: They are not in court by reason of a\ncontract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Here, they are before the arbitrator\nonly by reason of a contract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand -- and --\nQUESTION: But isn't the difficulty -- and I --\nI -- I'm still having trouble getting over this. Isn't\nthe difficulty that -- one -- one thing you said a second\nago is -- is really not accurate, I don't think.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I apologize --\nQUESTION: They don't consent to every jot and\ntittle of the means by which the arbitration will be\nconducted.\nThey consent in a gross kind of way to\narbitration or nonarbitration, and -- and that's -- that's\nwhat their consent makes the difference between, but they\ndon't consent to every consequent detail that enters into\nthe actual conduct of the arbitration, so why should we\ndraw the line where you want us to draw the line as\nopposed to drawing the line a little further and saying,\nif you consent to arbitration and a State says, not\ninconsistently with the FAA, arbitration can be done on a\nclass basis if there are common issues and so on? Why\nshould we draw the line to exclude that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two answers to\nthat. The premise of it, which is that the FAA doesn't\nhave anything to say about this, but the core principle of\nthe FAA is that there is supposed to be consent of the\nparties, so we ought to be looking to the expectations of\nthe parties to determine what rights you're going to\nadjudicate as a matter of arbitration.\nQUESTION:\nfar from anything that would have been contemplated --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- as a detail to be filled in later,\nand that's why you draw the line --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's -- that is exactly right,\nJustice Souter, and if you look at the South Carolina\nSupreme Court's opinion it doesn't talk about anything\nthat has to do with consent. It talks about equity and\nfairness and judicial economy, all factors that influence\nthe rights of third parties who have nothing to do with\nthe arbitration agreement that's before the arbitrator.\nQUESTION: I thought the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt said there's a -- there's a silence in this contract\nand we're going to construe it against the drafter. You\nconcede that you could have arbitration in a class format,\nand so that South Carolina said it doesn't -- this\ncontract doesn't say one way or the other and we'll\nconstrue it against the drafter.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- but what the South\nCarolina Supreme Court said was, we're going to promote\njudicial economy and we're going to do it without a\ncontractual directive to do so.\nTo be sure, the court said we -- we do not find\nlanguage so clear here -- because you know, what they're\nbasically worried about is, does this absolutely prohibit\nthe possibility of class arbitration. Is there language\nin there that says, under no circumstances will we ever\nhave class arbitration. I would have read the -- this\nagreement to have actually said that, but they didn't say\nthat.\nWhat they said is, well, we think it's -- we\nthink it's ambiguous, and therefore we'll construe it\nagainst you, but all that gets you to the point is that\nthe contract says nothing about this, and the problem with\ntrying to square that with the FAA is that the animus for,\nor the -- the motivation for acting under the Federal\nArbitration Act is the consent of the parties, not simply\ncan you manipulate the contract in a way that gets you\nto --\nQUESTION: But it -- but it is true, is it not,\nthat everybody in the class has consented to an\narbitration with Green Tree --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. No.\nQUESTION: Not to a class action arbitration,\nbut to an arbitration.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, has -- well, has\nconsented -- yes, has signed an arbitration agreement --\nQUESTION: But not with these arbitrators.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But not with this arbitrator,\nthat's correct.\nQUESTION: But I thought that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: We had --\nQUESTION: But they have consented to the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And we have a right in it, and\nit's worth pointing out we still have a right, with\nrespect to each one of those third party claims, to have\nour choice of arbitrators. We picked this guy for these\nthree or four claims. As Justice Kennedy observed, we\nwent --\nQUESTION: But is it really reasonable to assume\nthat if he knew he had a thousand different arbitrations\ncoming up he'd want a thousand different arbitrators?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nQUESTION: With the same issue in every case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure. Why not?\nQUESTION: Because --\nQUESTION: Don't they wear -- wear out after\njust one case, then?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the point is that --\nQUESTION: You might not want to put your\ncompany's entire future in the hands of one arbitrator.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of a single arbitrator --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- with no right to judicial\nreview --\nQUESTION: Makes some sense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Stevens. The problem\nis, why would we make a judgment at the outset of this\nprocess that says, we are going to enter into the most\ninformal decisionmaking process with no right to judicial\nreview and with $27 million at stake.\nQUESTION: Where -- where is it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No one would. It would be\nmadness.\nQUESTION: Where is it in the record that you\nfirst made your objection to the class action, and do\nyou -- does that objection say that we have not consented\nto the arbitration as to these other parties? Is that how\nyour objection was phrased, and where can I find it in the\nrecord?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, I'm going to\nhave to answer that on -- in the rebuttal.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'll give you the specific\ncitation when I step up here. If there are no other\nquestions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips.\nMs. Pillard, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T.L. PILLARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. PILLARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nGreen Tree first protested by asking the\narbitrator to decide whether the case could go forward as\na class. They did not object to his power to decide, but\nthey asked him to decide and I -- I think the relevant\ndocument is on page 15 of the joint appendix, which is\nGreen Tree's memorandum to the arbitrator.\nThere is nothing in the FAA that preempts a\nState court or arbitrator from applying ordinary State\ncontract law, the doctrine of construction against the\ndrafter, to read a contract to authorize class\narbitration. As a legal matter, the consent of the\nparties is determined under State contract law by applying\nthe doctrines of contract law to resolve ambiguities where\nthey exist.\nQUESTION: What doctrine of state contract law\nled you -- led to this result, the doctrine of construe\nthe instrument against, contra proferentem against the\nperson who drafted it?\nMS. PILLARD: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: Now, can -- can that produce\nanything? I mean, suppose one side claims the contract\nsays nothing about it, but one side claims, you should pay\nall the costs of the arbitrator, all right. Is -- is a\nState court going to decide that question by simply\nsaying, well, the contract says nothing about it, but to\ndo it that way would be against the interests of the\ndrafter, so yes, it's in the contract?\nMS. PILLARD: The --\nQUESTION: And my next question is going to be,\nwhat if the other side comes in and says, you ought to pay\nme $10 million, and the other side says, gee, there's\nnothing in the contract about that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Can the State court say, well, it's\nagainst the -- it's against the interests of the drafter\nso it must be there in the contract?\nI mean, that seems -- this seems to me just as\nweird --\nMS. PILLARD: You apply --\nQUESTION: -- to -- to pluck out a right to a\nclass action for no other reason than that it is against\nthe interests of the person who drafted the contract.\nIt's weird.\nMS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, the -- the\nargument is that the arbitrator has the authority under\nState law to interpret the ambiguity in the contract, and\nit's not weird at all in this case, where, since 1979 in\nSouth Carolina, arbitrators have had the authority to\nconsolidate arbitrations, and the leading cases, Champ,\nthe case on which Green Tree relies, Episcopal Housing,\nwhich is the First Circuit case, the -- the cases that\nlook at whether this is allowed, advert to -- I'm sorry,\nEpiscopal Housing was itself a consolidation case, but the\ncases that allow class arbitration advert to the\nunderlying rule in the jurisdiction --\nQUESTION: There's a big difference --\nQUESTION: What are consolidation arbitration --\nwhat do you mean by that? You mean when the same\narbitrator has more than one case involving the same\nissue?\nMS. PILLARD: The same arbitrator can take\ndifferent disputes under arbitration clauses and bring\nthem together where --\nQUESTION: When he's been selected for the\nvarious issues. I mean he -- he's been selected in -- in\nall of the various cases. The parties have agreed to this\narbitrator. They just haven't agreed to have them all\ndecided in one proceeding, is that right?\nMS. PILLARD: That's right. They're all -- but,\nthat's one of the versions --\nQUESTION: But that -- that's a long -- that's a\nlong way off from compelling somebody who hasn't agreed to\nthis arbitration.\nMS. PILLARD: It -- it's not at all. First of\nall, I disagree with the premise of your question, Justice\nScalia, that they haven't agreed to this. Where the\ncontract permits it, what Green Tree and the -- the class\nmembers, absent and named class members agreed to was a\ncontract with the potential for a class proceeding, with\nthe potential for a class proceeding.\nThis -- under the Southland cases, since --\nsince 20 years ago cases have been going forward --\nQUESTION: That begs the question. I mean, that\nprecisely begs the question. I mean --\nMS. PILLARD: They --\nQUESTION: -- that's what we're debating,\nwhether they -- whether they agreed to that or not, and to\nsay that they agreed to it because they agreed to it\ndoesn't get us very far.\nMS. PILLARD: This is an FAA preemption case,\nbut the FAA has nothing to say here. The act doesn't say\nanything about class arbitration, and the FAA ousts only\nState law that is hostile to arbitration.\nQUESTION: All right, well, why isn't this\nhostile? It seems to me that is the question.\nMS. PILLARD: It's not hostile --\nQUESTION:\nexample. You would agree that the State couldn't\ninterpret silence as follows. The word arbitration in\nthis contract, since it's silent, means that the\narbitration will take place at the bottom of a coal mine\nwith no air, okay. We agree, right?\nMS. PILLARD: Right.\nQUESTION: All right, and what the other side\nhas said is, you know, in respect to one of the parties,\nthis is the same thing. Of course my client would never\nhave agreed to arbitration if he knew that a class action\nlawyer could find a provision in the contract that nobody\nthinks really hurt them but, in fact, we didn't live up\nto, and then obtain $10 million in a judgment before an\narbitrator, of which he gets three and the rest is\ndistributed.\nNow, look, that's what we were trying to get\naway from. That's why we went to arbitration and not the\ncourt. Of course we wouldn't agree to such a thing, and\nof course reading such a thing into the silence is the\nsame as putting us at the bottom of that coal mine, or at\nleast close enough so you cannot say that it is neutral as\nto whether or not arbitration is good or bad or likely to\noccur, or Volt was neutral or pro-arbitration. This State\nrule is not neutral, it is hostile to it.\nNow, that's basically their argument, as I\nunderstand it, and I'd like to hear the reply.\nMS. PILLARD: I think, Justice Breyer, that\nmisapprehends what we mean by hostile to arbitration.\nHostility to arbitration refers to State rules that are\nsuspicious of or undermine the ability of an arbitral\nforum to resolve a dispute, and saying that a case is\ngoing to proceed on a class basis is a far cry from saying\nthis case is going to proceed at the bottom of a coal\nmine, where parties' rights would actually be -- would not\nbe able to be fulfilled. That's the outside edge. This\nCourt has -- has always said, well, arbitration can't go\nforward if the parties can't get meaningful relief, and --\nand I think your coal mine case would be such a case.\nBut what we mean by hostile to arbitration is\nnot whether one or the other party to the arbitration\nwishes that they, in the end, once the dispute arises,\nthat they weren't before an arbitrator. No. What we mean\nis, whether State law reflects a suspicion about the\ncapacity of arbitration to resolve a dispute, and if\nanybody --\nQUESTION: Could they -- could they then have a\nState law that says, and the party that invokes the\narbitration in the contract will receive from the other\nparty a bonus of about $100,000 for having done a good\nthing?\nthe coal mine, and all I've done is make sure that the\narbitration -- it's not -- it's not -- you see, it\nsatisfies your test.\nMS. PILLARD: I -- I don't think it does,\nbecause it's -- well, because it's -- it's targeted at the\narbitration, and if the State had such a rule one could\nlook at, what's the purpose, what's the legitimate purpose\nof that rule --\nQUESTION: They love arbitration. Oh, but\nforget my ridiculous example. Go ahead with your -- with\nyour -- with your explanation.\nMS. PILLARD: It seems the -- well, that is --\nis the focus. The focus has to be whether the State law,\nnot looking at ex post, once the parties are -- are\nunhappy with the broadly worded contract --\nQUESTION: Okay, I've got that. Then do you\nthink -- the other question that's bothering me -- that\nwas one, and there's one other, is that we have the words\nin the contract here, and the words are, the dispute, any\nclaim, including what the contract means, or the validity\nof the arbitration clause, et cetera, shall be resolved by\nbinding arbitration, by one arbitrator, selected by us,\nwith consent of you, okay.\nMS. PILLARD: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's the phrase.\nMS. PILLARD: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, there obviously is a\ndisagreement as to the meaning of that phrase. Well, why\nshouldn't that be arbitrated?\nMS. PILLARD: Exactly, and it was.\nQUESTION: All right. Then what we should do in\nthis case is say, forget what the North Carolina Supreme\nCourt says --\nQUESTION: South Carolina.\nQUESTION: South Carolina, sorry. I got it\nright the first time -- South Carolina Supreme Court.\nForget what they say. The question is, what did the\nparties mean, and therefore send it back to the arbitrator\nfor that determination, not influenced by the South\nCarolina opinion in front of us. Now, is that the correct\nresolution, then?\nMS. PILLARD: No, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMS. PILLARD: Because the arbitrator already did\nlook at this clause and decided that the -- that the\nlanguage of the arbitration agreement allowed him to\ndecide.\nQUESTION: I thought the first case was a case\nwhere the South Carolina Supreme Court, Bazzle or one of\nthem was -- the South Carolina Supreme Court said what it\nmeant, not the arbitrator. The second case, which was in\nfront of the arbitrator, was the arbitrator being\ninfluenced by what the South Carolina Supreme Court had\nsaid.\nMS. PILLARD: The -- the Bazzle case did not go\nup to the South Carolina Supreme Court before --\nQUESTION: Then it's the other, it's Lackey the\nSupreme Court --\nMS. PILLARD: The cases came up to the Supreme\nCourt together --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. PILLARD: -- after both decisions were made,\nand as an initial matter the Bazzle case went to the trial\ncourt, which decided as an initial matter that the -- in\nthe Lackey case the -- the arbitrator made the decision as\nan initial matter, looking at the language of the contract\nand determining, without any prior judicial instruction on\nthe matter --\nQUESTION: Not an instruction, but -- but was he\nnot guided or influenced in some way by the Supreme Court\ndecision?\nMS. PILLARD: Green Tree tries for the first\ntime in this Court to dispute that the arbitrator in\nLackey made an independent decision --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. PILLARD: -- that the contract authorized\nclass arbitration. That argument is a complete red\nherring. Their own brief to the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt repeatedly asserted that in Lackey the arbitrator,\nquote, took it upon himself to determine the propriety of\na class-wide arbitration and certify a class. That's at\npage 29 of their South Carolina Supreme Court brief. They\nsay again and again -- their question presented refers to\nthe arbitrator deciding the class action issue himself.\nThat's question presented 2 --\nQUESTION: That was in -- that was in Lackey.\nIn Bazzle, did the arbitrator, after the, what I'll call\nreferral from the State trial court, did the arbitrator\nthen say, as an -- as an independent matter, I ratify, I\nconfirm, I -- I agree that the contract should be\ninterpreted this way, or does it -- or did he just say, I\nam following the order of the court?\nMS. PILLARD: We don't have either precisely,\nbut let me tell you what I think is relevant to that. The\narbitrator in Bazzle did also consider the issue. The\nissue was placed squarely before the arbitrator when Green\nTree moved him to decertify the class to grant that Green\nTree did fight this, a --\nQUESTION: Wait, wait, wait. Why -- why -- what\nissue was placed before him when they moved to decertify\nhim?\nMS. PILLARD: They moved to decertify --\nQUESTION: The issue of whether he would be\nin -- in violation of the order of the South Carolina\nSupreme Court?\nMS. PILLARD: There was no order of the South\nCarolina Supreme Court at that time.\nQUESTION: No.\nMS. PILLARD: There was only the order of the\ntrial court, which read the contract to allow class\narbitration. Then it -- the class was certified and sent\nto the arbitrator, and then the issue was before the\narbitrator should he decertify the class, and Green Tree\nargued that -- that they should.\nMoreover, in Green Tree's motion to vacate the\naward, after the arbitrator in Bazzle made the arbitration\naward, they characterized the arbitrator as having made\nthe decision that the class could proceed in arbitration.\nQUESTION: I'm sure they did, so -- but my\nimpression is they appointed in Bazzle, the district court\nappointed a class, or certified it.\nMS. PILLARD: Certified a class.\nQUESTION: All right, it was after that that\nthey go to the arbitrator in Lackey, and now what they're\ntelling us is, the arbitrator in Lackey, knowing that the\ndistrict court had appointed the class in Bazzle, then\nappointed the class in Lackey, and what they say, I take\nit, is well, that's not independent, he just thought\nthat's what he's supposed to do.\nMS. PILLARD: Right, and -- and I very much\ndisagree with that characterization of the record, and\nI'll try to help to make it clearer.\nFirst, as I pointed out, in their own briefs in\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court, they characterized the\nLackey arbitrator as having acted independently. There is\nno -- no record support for Green Tree's current\nassertions that the arbitrator did not make an independent\ndecision. There is nothing in the record that supports\nit, and it is not the case.\nThe arbitrator said that he determined that a\nclass action should proceed based on his careful review of\nthe broadly drafted arbitration clause prepared by Green\nTree. That's --\nQUESTION: Is there any history, Ms. Pillard, of\nthis in South Carolina, or is this the first time? Have\nthere been class proceedings before arbitrators in the\npast?\nMS. PILLARD: I'm not aware that there are,\nJustice Ginsburg. I'm not aware of any reported decisions\non that.\nthe -- one of the largest economies in the world for --\nfor 20 years, and there have been a smattering of class\narbitrations in other places, and I -- I --\nQUESTION: Ms. Pillard, when -- when a class\naction is instituted, it seems to me it amounts to an\ninterpretation not just of -- of these contracts that were\nin front of this arbitrator, but also of the other\ncontracts that have been brought into this arbitration,\nand what I find it difficult to see is how any\ninterpretation of one of those other contracts would --\nwould allow them to be brought into this from the\nstandpoint not of this company -- this company at least\nselected this arbitrator for these cases, and you could\nsay, well, they didn't select him for the other cases,\nwhich may be a good point, but let's talk about the\ncustomers, the plaintiffs.\nThey didn't select this arbitrator for any case,\nnot even -- not even for their own case. They have had\nfoisted upon them not some Federal district judge who has,\nyou know, the -- the army behind him, but -- but some\narbitrator that, you know -- who knows who, that they --\nthey never selected at all. How can you possibly draw\nthem into this -- how can you possibly say that that\ncontract is reasonably interpreted to allow them to be\nbrought into this -- into this arbitration?\nMS. PILLARD: I have two answers to that,\nJustice Scalia. First, there's no question that if, under\na contract that had a forum selection clause that said,\nany disputes under this contract will be resolved in a\nforum chosen by us with the consent of you, and a\nplaintiff chose a forum and filed a class action and\noffered opt-out rights to every absent class member who\nwanted to opt out, and those absent class members were\nbound by the same contract, their right to consent to the\nforum would be protected.\nQUESTION: But that's deceptive. They -- they\nare summoned in by the power of the Government, not by --\nnot by their -- their contractual commitment to be\nsummoned in. Even if there were no contract they could be\nmade part of a class action, so to say that you can do it\nwhen the Government is coercing it, and therefore it's a\nperfectly reasonable interpretation of a contract, doesn't\nmake sense to me.\nMS. PILLARD: I --\nQUESTION: Here, the only basis for getting --\nfor getting these plaintiffs into this court, or into this\narbitral court is their voluntary agreement, and their\nvoluntary agreement gave them the right to select an\narbitrator, and they have been deprived of that right\nentirely.\nMS. PILLARD: I agree with you, Justice Scalia,\nup to your last sentence. They have not been deprived of\nthat right. It is exactly true that the authority of the\narbitrator over the absent class members derives from\ncontract, and every single absent class member was a -- a\nsignatory to the -- to the same arbitration clause. They\nwere all governed by the same clause, and once --\nQUESTION: But -- but Green Tree didn't appoint\nthe arbitrator for that purpose. Green Tree appointed the\narbitrator for X, Y, and Z.\nMS. PILLARD: Green Tree wrote a clause that --\nit swept everything within it. They said, we trust\neverything to the arbitrator. This clause is extremely\nbroad. Once they did that -- they drafted a clause which\nthe arbitrator and every South Carolina judge to look at\nit believed was susceptible of a reading that had\nauthorized class action. In that case, you read this\ncontract as if it had provided for class arbitration, and\nwhen they select --\nQUESTION: Wait, wait --\nQUESTION: Could the -- could the arbitrator\nhave said, I'm -- I'm going to include in -- in this class\nsome people who don't have an arbitration contract at all?\nMS. PILLARD: I would think not, no, and indeed,\nthose people were excluded in this case.\nQUESTION: And -- and why is that?\nMS. PILLARD: Because they have --\nQUESTION: Because the -- Green Tree did not\nconsent to that.\nMS. PILLARD: Because they have no -- the\narbitrator has no authority over them, because neither\nthey nor Green Tree consented to that, but by hypothesis,\nif you had a clause --\nQUESTION: The hypothesis is, the consent must\nbe bilateral, and here it wasn't.\nMS. PILLARD: Oh, I disagree. The consent was\nbilateral. Green Tree chose an arbitrator, and when it\nchose an arbitrator for a case under a contract broad\nenough to authorize class action, legally it has chosen an\narbitrator with the possibility that the class could\nproceed. Indeed, when they chose --\nQUESTION: All right, but what --\nMS. PILLARD: -- the arbitrator, the case had\nalready been filed as a class action. It was -- they were\non notice --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. PILLARD: -- of the possibility that this\nissue would be litigated on a class basis.\nQUESTION: Well, they were on notice that\nsomebody wanted a class action, but it seems to me,\nnumber 1, they were not on notice that South Carolina law\nwould provide a -- a class arbitration because, as you\nsaid, it hadn't occurred before, and the only thing that\nthey definitely consented to was an arbitrator for this\ncase, and in a situation in which there was no existing\nState law that put them on notice that they were in\njeopardy of this result, they're saying there are some\nthings we -- I think they're saying there are some things\nwe -- we agree that have to be filled in later about the\nterms of the arbitration.\nBut with no history to indicate that the request\nfor class -- or class treatment would be granted and would\nbe possible under South Carolina law, we surely did not\nconsent, we certainly did not take the risk that we\nconsented, that we were consenting to arbitration for all\nof these other people, and if you doubt that, Mr. Phillips\nsays, just step back and -- and bear this in mind.\nWithout judicial review, would we have rolled the dice for\n$27 million on one arbitrator? What is -- what is your\nanswer to that, that it, in effect, it is just too\nimplausible to draw this conclusion out of the limited\nconsent that they gave?\nMS. PILLARD: I have several answers to that,\nJustice Souter. First of all, this Court has never said\nthat a case with a large amount of money at stake, indeed\nin Mitsubishi Motors with antitrust cases, in McMahon with\nRICOs -- RICO and securities cases, large amounts of money\nat stake, arbitration is permitted. They --\nQUESTION: Oh, no question about it. It's a\nquestion of what they plausibly consented to.\nMS. PILLARD: Right.\nQUESTION: That's the point of his argument.\nMS. PILLARD: Right. They were -- they were on\nnotice. If they had good lawyers doing this, they would\nhave a long time before 1998 put in the simple one phrase\nthat they put into their contract as of 1998 which says,\nnobody who signs this can be a class member or a class\nrepresentative.\nQUESTION: Well, if they had been in California\nthey would have done that, but were -- were, you know,\nwere they on notice that they had better guard against\nthat jeopardy in South Carolina?\nMS. PILLARD: Yes. I think in -- in particular,\nthe Episcopal Housing case put them on notice as of 1979\nthere were consolidations being permitted, and the courts\nwho were looking at the class question, the Champ court --\nQUESTION: Consolidations aren't class actions.\nI mean, those are quite different.\nMS. PILLARD: I agree with you, Justice Scalia,\nbut the fact of the matter is, the courts that have\ndecided whether or not to authorize class arbitration in\nan appropriate case have looked as an analogy to the\nconsolidation precedent, so you have a jurisdiction in\nwhich there is consolidation precedent, and parties, when\nthey agree to contracts in ambiguous terms, agree to\nsubmit to the natural evolution of State law, and that\nis -- that does on occasion present risks. That does\npresent risks, but they chose both to draft a clause very\nbroadly and to submit everything to the arbitrator.\nQUESTION: Well, they're saying this isn't\nnatural evolution, this is creationism, and --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- don't -- don't they have a --\ndon't they have a point that there is a distinction when\nthe difference gets to be that great?\nMS. PILLARD: No, and I -- and I certainly don't\nthink that is a preemption question for this Court. I\ncertainly don't think so.\nQUESTION: No, no, but it says the terms have to\nbe -- I mean, it doesn't -- it says in the statute you\nhave to enforce the arbitration that they wrote, and\nhere -- now, it is -- this point is bothering me, because\nI'm not sure what your answer to this was. I do see the\nphrase, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, by one\narbitrator selected by us, with consent of you.\nNow, the opt-out can be, consent of you. I get\nthat. If they don't opt out, they consent, but what about\nthe phrase, by one arbitrator selected by us? We've come\naround, we've been talking about that nonstop, but I -- I\ndon't have a clear answer to that, because what seems\nabsolutely clear in the case of Justice Scalia and me, and\nhe's never been in this courtroom, or in the arbitrator\nroom or anywhere, you know, I didn't select that\narbitrator. I selected you for a different case.\nNow -- now, how do we -- how do we square that\nwith the words, an arbitrator selected by me, if I'm Green\nTree?\nMS. PILLARD: Because -- two reasons. One is\nthat this was filed as a class action, so when they\nselected the arbitrator they were on notice that at least\nthe plaintiffs were trying to do this. The second --\nQUESTION: So if they said right at that point\nwe don't want this as a class action, then they win?\nMS. PILLARD: No.\nQUESTION: No, okay.\nMS. PILLARD: The second answer is that the\ncontract was written in such a way as to be susceptible of\npermitting class arbitration, so when they select an\narbitrator under this contract, they take into account,\nthis could be an arbitrator that could award punitive\ndamages. This could be an arbitrator that could proceed\non a class basis. This could be an arbitrator who could\norder --\nQUESTION: All right, I see, but --\nMS. PILLARD: -- broad discovery.\nQUESTION: If they had had a --\nMS. PILLARD: This could be an arbitrator who\ncould do any of the things the contract permits.\nQUESTION: If they had had enough foresight,\ncould they have told the arbitrator, we are selecting you,\nbut for this suit only. You may not have a class action.\nWe are not consenting. Could they have said that up\nfront?\nMS. PILLARD: I don't think so. I don't think\nso, because the -- the language of the contract and the\nauthority that they have given to arbitrators is\ndetermined from the contract language, not from the\nparties' choices at the threshold where a particular\ndispute has already arisen.\nQUESTION: I -- I notice the -- none -- none of\nyour answers to these questions, including -- you had\nseveral answers for Justice Souter. None of your answers\nsaid, well, you know, that's a very interesting theory,\nMr. Justice, but this is a State law matter, it's not for\nyou. I -- I haven't heard that.\nMS. PILLARD: Well, I -- I intended to give --\nto give that answer when I said this is not a preemption\nquestion. It is not an FAA question. It is a State law\nquestion, and I think that's exactly right, Justice\nKennedy, the narrow scope of FAA preemption focuses on\nwhether State law is hostile to the arbitration forum, to\nthe choice of arbitral forum to resolve ambiguities like\nthese. There is --\nQUESTION: Suppose a -- suppose the State law\nsaid, not only do we interpret silence to mean you can\nhave it in a class format, but that if any arbitration\nclause -- any arbitration contract excludes class action\nwe will hold that against our public policy and\nunenforceable?\nMS. PILLARD: One would have to look at the\nreasoning of the State court in so holding. If the\nreasoning was hostility to arbitration, trying to trade it\nup --\nQUESTION: Well, the -- the Supreme Court would\nexplain, we love arbitration, that's why we're not going\nto let anybody make it a smaller arbitration, so that's --\nso we're not being hostile to arbitration.\nMS. PILLARD: That is, as the South Carolina\nSupreme Court made clear, not the issue in this case. If\nit were an application of general contract principles of\nunconscionability in a particular case with no suspicion\nof arbitration as such, then I think a State could do that\nunder State law.\nIf the State had a general law that applied to\nlitigation and arbitration against class action waivers,\nor against waivers of class actions in adhesive contracts\nthat applied to both fora, to the litigation and to the\narbitration, I think under that circumstance also it would\nnot be hostile to arbitration for the State law to\noverride the parties' choice --\nQUESTION: What's your authority that -- that it\nhas to be -- you -- you seem to -- to be positing some\nkind of a -- of an intent requirement on the part of the\nState. It has to really have it in for arbitration.\nWhy isn't the Federal Arbitration Act more\nreasonably interpreted as directed at those State laws\nthat -- that are destructive of arbitration, that -- that\nare -- are hostile not in the sense of any -- of any\nmental intent, but that in their operation make it\ndifficult for parties to enter into arbitration\nagreements, and if that's what it means, a law that\ninterprets a -- an arbitration agreement fantastically,\nyou know, down at the bottom of the coal mine, or, you\nknow, you -- you have to pay so many million dollars win\nor lose, or, I think, you -- you have to subject yourself\nto -- to class actions, is a law that is hostile to\narbitration, that is -- it is -- it is antagonistic to the\nability of parties to decide between themselves how, when,\nand where and to what extent they will have an arbitrator\ndecide matters for them?\nMS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, parties have an\nability to do that, and anyone who wants to put in a\nclause saying, no class arbitration, is invited to do\nthat. This Court has never interpreted hostility to\narbitration that broadly, as you just described. What\nthis Court has said again and again is that the FAA\npreempts only State laws that single out arbitration\nprovisions for suspect status that undercut the\nenforceability of arbitration agreements.\nHere, the arbitration agreement was enforced,\nand there is no FAA rule, contrary to Green Tree's\ncontentions, that all arbitration agreements should be\nenforced according to their written terms without the\nbenefit of State rules for resolving contract ambiguity.\nRather, as the Court reiterated in Waffle House,\nabsent some ambiguity in the agreement, it is the language\nof the contract that defines the scope of disputes subject\nto arbitration. This Court has repeatedly made clear that\nit is State contract law that applies, and it is State\ncontract law that resolves any contract ambiguity.\nGreen Tree is seeking a radical expansion of FAA\npreemption. Their rule would federalize countless\ndisputes over the meaning of arbitration clauses. Parties\nto arbitration will come and say, we never intended to --\nto permit discovery, protective orders, various types of\nmotions, types of damages and the like that would invite\nany party unhappy with the results of an arbitration,\nsaying we're getting into more than we thought, this is\nhostile to arbitration as we prefer, to come to this Court\nand ask it to second-guess ordinary State law\ninterpretation of an arbitration agreement.\nThis Court should not expand the scope of FAA\npreemption in this case. There's no warrant for it here.\nQUESTION: May I ask this, if you have another\nmoment: Does this case have any real future significance,\nbecause isn't it fairly clear that all the arbitration\nagreements in the future will prohibit class actions?\nMS. PILLARD: It's really very limited, Justice\nStevens, I agree. This case deals with whether this\nparticular agreement foreclosed class arbitration. Green\nTree agrees that where an agreement authorizes it, class\narbitration can be done, and so all they're asking you to\ndo is to second-guess the State court's interpretation\napplying the rule of construction against the drafter, and\nI would very much dispute their characterization of what\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court did of applying a -- a\nrule without any contractual or statutory directive to do\nso.\nThe court was there quoting from a different\ncase, and this case is a fortiori. Clearly, the court\nlooked and said, there's no specific directive. As a\npreliminary matter, the court said, the contract is\nsilent. Then they looked at the more general language the\ntrial court had relied on and said, there's affirmative\nauthorization here under the general language, and they\nlooked at Green Tree's argument that the reference to this\ncontract foreclosed it, and the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt said, I find it ambiguous, and I'm going to apply\nthe ordinary rule of --\nQUESTION: Is there a risk that if we just did\nwhat you said, they write in no class actions, a court\nsays this is a contract of adhesion, and that provision's\noppressive, and so we strike it?\nMS. PILLARD: It depends on why they think it's\noppressive. If they think that waivers generally in\ncontracts, pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to\nproceed as a class, whether the contract is an arbitration\nagreement or not are oppressive, then I think it might not\nbe hostile to arbitration.\nIf they say, a waiver of a class action in an\narbitration setting is oppressive and unconstitutional,\nthat might run afoul of this Court's precedence in -- in\nCasarotto.\nQUESTION: You really think that they could\nallow a waiver of judicial review and disallow a waiver of\nclass actions? That would -- that would boggle my mind.\nAnd you think that wouldn't display hostility?\nMS. PILLARD: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Pillard.\nMr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Kennedy, in response to your question, I\ndon't know precisely the first time that we raised this\nissue, but I know that if you look at the record on\ndecision at pages 152 and again at 1539, in both Bazzle\nand in Lackey, we say point blank the arbitrator exceeded\nhis authority to proceed as a class action, and that\nneither Green Tree nor any of the unnamed class members\nconsented to have the arbitrator arbitrate their claims,\nso we said it as plainly as we could with respect to\nthe -- with respect to the notion of consent.\nThe specific -- aside from that, the South\nCarolina Supreme Court said we didn't waive our rights,\nand it's quite clear that if we fight over these issues in\nfront of the arbitrator, we don't waive our rights. That\nwas the holding of this Court in First Chicago.\nJustice Breyer, with respect to whether or not\nthe arbitrator thought he exercised independent authority,\nI think it's pretty clear that both parties in this case\nhave taken inconsistent positions. If you read the\nrespondent's briefs below, they say that the arbitrator\nhad no authority to go beyond the class certification of\nthe decision that had already been made by the State\ncourt. Whether he did or not I say at the end of the day\ndoesn't matter, because I don't think it's a question for\nthe arbitrator, but if it is, he exceeded his authority,\nbecause he clearly doesn't have the authority under this\ncontract to make a decision with respect to the third\nparties.\nThat takes us to the question Justice Scalia\nraised, which is, you know, what -- what do you do with\nthe fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court has said\nnot word one about arbitrator selected by me? There's\nnothing that interprets that language of this agreement,\nand if the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't have at least\nsome component here to say, look, the terms of the\ncontract cannot be categorically ignored or disregarded by\nthe State court, those are rights that are there. We said\nas plainly as we could we would not consent to this, and\nthe court rejected it.\nAnd the final point I would make with respect to\nhostility, while it is true that this Court has\nconsistently struck down efforts to be hostile to\narbitration, it has never said that that's the only basis\non which preemption will arise. Preemption in this\ncontext exists in the same way it does in every other\ncontext, does it interfere with the full achievement of\nCongress' objections. That's Hines v. Davidowitz, and the\nanswer to that here, and it's the same answer that would\narise if they were to -- if we had an agreement that said\nclass action has, that of course this is manifest\nhostility to this arbitration agreement as written. It's\na bilateral agreement, and all the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt had to say about that bilateral agreement is, it\nwould be judicially inefficient for us to have to go\nthrough each one of these individually.\nWell, that's all well and good, but that's\ncoercion, that's not consent, and if the Federal\nArbitration Act has any meaning, it means that you apply\nthe consent of the parties here, and if you do that, the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court has to be overturned.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:\nMr. Phillips.\n"
