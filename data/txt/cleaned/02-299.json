CARPENTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CARPENTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn multistate power systems, each retail rake -\nratemaking body has incentives to impose cost allocations\nthat benefit its residents, and the only way to assure\nthat the power pool recovers a hundred percent of its\ngenerating costs is for a neutral body to referee disputes\namong the States and to fix the allocations.\nThis case arises in the energy system where five\nsubsidiaries provide retail service in four different\nStates, where FERC has found that Entergy's cost\nallocations generally can't affect its net revenues and\nwhere FERC has thus approved a tariff that gives Entergy\nauthority to calculate the inter-company equalization\npayments that allocate costs with a FERC complaint as the\nsole remedy if the rates and allocations are believed to\nbe unlawful.\nThough we --\nQUESTION: What is -- what is the source of the\nrule that this is the sole remedy?\nMR. CARPENTER: It's the sole remedy under the\ntariff itself, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The -- so the tariff itself provides\nthat.\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes. Under the tariff itself,\nthe only right that is reserved to the -- this is section\n4.12, joint appendix 11a. The only right that is reserved\nto the operating companies is to seek amend -- if there's\na dispute over the rates, is to seek amendments in the\ntariff or changes in the rate from the regulatory body\nthat has jurisdiction.\nThere's no question here that the LPSC doesn't\nhave jurisdiction to order amendments to the service\nschedule or changes in the rates. Their claim is only\nthat they can disallow the costs that were incurred.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the tariff provision meant\nto preclude any sort of a judicial remedy?\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes, it would preclude a\njudicial remedy. It operates as a -- as a -- as,\nobviously, a limitation on the operating companies'\nremedies and as a forum selection clause in the event of a\ndispute.\nQUESTION: Well, there would be a judicial\nremedy if they disagreed with the -- with -- with FERC's\ndetermination. They could -- they could appeal that to\nthe court.\nMR. CARPENTER: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. I'm\nsorry. I --\nQUESTION: They just couldn't go straight to the\ncourt.\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes. No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nI -- I meant that they can't go -- they couldn't go\nstraight to court, and it means that -- for the same\nreason that a State retail ratemaking body can't disallow\nthe costs because under -- under this rate schedule, the\nrate calculated by the energy system is the filed rate and\nbinds everybody unless and until a complaint is filed with\nFERC and FERC holds otherwise.\nAnd in fact, the Louisiana commission here\nbrought a complaint for the period ending in August of\n1997, and FERC denied relief on the ground that although\nthe tariff didn't authorize it, it was just and --\nnonetheless just and reasonable for Entergy to calculate\nequalization payments by including certain units that were\nin extended reserve status because FERC found that those\nunits benefited Louisiana and the entire system.\nQUESTION: Can I ask? The -- the section of\nthe -- of the agreement that you -- you referred us to,\n4.12. It says each company reserves the right to\nunilaterally seek amendments or changes from any\nregulatory body having or acquiring jurisdiction\nthereover. Why didn't they just say from FERC?\nMR. CARPENTER: Well, at the time this --\nQUESTION: I mean, if as you say it's only FERC,\nwhy didn't they just say from FERC?\nMR. CARPENTER: Well, it was -- it was fairly\nprescient because this -- this language I think dates from\n1953, when there was the Federal Power Commission. So,\nit --\nQUESTION: Oh, I see. I see. Yes.\nMR. CARPENTER: But the -- the key thing here is\nthat it's undisputed that the LPSC can't amend the\nservice agreement.\nQUESTION: Got you. No. I was just wondering\nwhether --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that was so clear to the parties\nat the time, and you say it is and -- and what they --\nwhat they were anticipating is a change in the Federal --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- body that had jurisdiction.\nMR. CARPENTER: Right.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CARPENTER: But -- but in the aftermath of\nthe FERC order that found that these charges were just and\nreasonable, despite a finding of the tariff violation, the\nLouisiana commission entered an order that said that\nFERC's determination bound it only for the precise period\nthat FERC had addressed, and then entered an order that\nprohibited the petitioner, Entergy Louisiana, ELI, from\nrecovering the same wholesale costs in retail rates for\nthe immediately succeeding period, beginning August 5th,\n1977.\nQUESTION: Could -- could you explain one thing\nto me? And that is, why was the period so defined? Is it\nsimply that it was, with respect to that period, that\nactual figures were introduced before FERC?\nMR. CARPENTER: That became the period because\nthat was the date of the FERC order.\nQUESTION: The date of the --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And so, in effect, that -- FERC was\ndone with it at that --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes. That was the -- that was\nthe -- the theory --\nQUESTION: But -- but was there --\nMR. CARPENTER: -- of Louisiana Public Service\nCommission.\nQUESTION: Was there any question in the terms\nof the order that the order was intended to operate\nprospectively until FERC changed it?\nMR. CARPENTER: Oh, no. No question at all.\nQUESTION: So the difference is unlike a filed\nrate, which is a number, here is not a precise number.\nMR. CARPENTER: That's right. Here the filed\nrate is a formula that is --\nQUESTION: And it -- and it's going to change\nconstantly.\nMR. CARPENTER: That's right. It can change --\nit can change I believe monthly, or the -- the rate\ncalculated under the formula can change monthly. And --\nand FERC approves formula rates, you know, in\ncircumstances where it believes that it will better\npromote the overall goals of -- of the act, and it imposes\nterms and conditions that will assure that the overall\ngoals of the act are promoted.\nAnd here a critical term and condition was that\nthe determinations of the amount of the payments is\ncentralized at FERC and the only remedy, if there's a\ndisagreement, is to go to FERC and file a complaint. As I\npoint out, that's clear from the terms of the tariff, and\nthat's what FERC said in each of the orders in which it\nauthorized the formula rates.\nQUESTION: But it -- from the point of view of\nthe public service commission, they have to approve the\nlocal rates periodically, and how does the timing of the\nthing work? If the public service commission has to go to\nFERC and then there's a proceeding, and by that time the\nyear is over.\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes. But the -- if FERC were to\nagree with the public service commission that we violated\nthe tariff, that the result was unjust and unreasonable\nand a refund was appropriate, all the interests would be\nprotected because the -- they would order a refund at the\nwholesale level with interest that the Louisiana Public\nService Commission could flow through to retail rate\npapers -- rate payers.\nQUESTION: Well, wait, wait. How would -- how\nwould the Louisiana Public Service Commission have\nstanding to come to FERC? I mean, to come back to the\nagreement, it says each company -- the companies who are\nparties to the agreement -- reserves the right to\nunilaterally seek amendments or changes.\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes. Well, they have standing\nunder the act itself. Section 305 I believe it is.\nQUESTION: So this provision doesn't govern what\nthey can seek then.\nMR. CARPENTER: No. But -- but they -- but --\nbut what it does mean is that they cannot premise a -- a\nprudence disallowance on the ground that -- that ELI could\nhave refused to pay the costs or -- or required that the\nequalization payments be calculated on a different basis.\nQUESTION: Well, sure, they can. They could say\nthe company was at fault for not going to FERC.\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes. But -- but -- sure, they\ncould say that. It was imprudent not to go to FERC. But\nthey can't speculate about what FERC would do in the event\na complaint was filed. That's clear from the Arkansas\nLouisiana Gas case of this Court. So while it's\ntheoretically possible they could say that it was\nimprudent not to go to FERC, no remedy could be predicated\non that finding of imprudence because they can't speculate\nabout what FERC would do if a complaint were filed.\nQUESTION: But can they go to FERC as an\nintervenor? I --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I take it that was their status.\nMR. CARPENTER: Absolutely, absolutely.\nQUESTION: So they could go in and say, look,\nthey should have complained --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and therefore you should do what\nyou would have done if they had complained.\nMR. CARPENTER: Absolutely. They can do that.\nAnd the point I was trying to make to Justice Ginsburg is\nit -- when that procedure is followed, all legitimate\ninterests are protected because if FERC agrees and orders\na refund, it will be -- it can then be flowed through by\nthe Louisiana Commission to the retail ratepayers.\nConversely, under their procedure in which they\ncan disallow costs pending a FERC determination on the\nprecise -- on the precise issue, you have exactly the --\nthe interference with commerce that the Federal Power Act\nwas designed to prevent. You've got duplicative\nlitigation of this issue. Here in -- could be in five\ndifferent retail ratemaking bodies.\nAnd the effect can be a trapping of costs that\nwe never get back because if FERC -- you know, they --\nthey trap the costs pending the FERC order. FERC then\nsays -- reviews it and says what we did was fine, just and\nreasonable. Then obviously FERC doesn't do anything at\nthe wholesale level. In the meantime, our costs have been\ntrapped at the retail level, and we can't get the money\nback under the general rule barring retroactive ratemaking\nunless an exception were somehow made to that rule.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the function and\nprovince of the State commission's prudence review?\nWhat -- what can they do that's proper? And I assume they\ncan do a number of things that increase costs and\ntherefore change rates, or am I wrong about that?\nMR. CARPENTER: Well, what they -- what they can\ndo is they can regulate the -- the prudence of -- of\ndecisions that the -- the utility had to make. So in\ncircumstances where a FERC tariff provides a choice to\nthe -- to the retail utility, which was the situation in\nthe Pike County case, then -- then the -- the State\ncommission can find that it was imprudent to exercise the\nchoice in one fashion or another.\nBut the point here is there was no choice. The\nequalization payment bound the -- bound ELI unless and\nuntil it was found to be unlawful by -- by FERC. So this\nis a situation where under the filed rate doctrine and\nunder this Court's decisions in MP&L and Nantahala, the --\nthe State commission was required to treat the resulting\nexpense as a retail -- as a just and reasonable expense\nand pass it through to retail ratepayers unless and until\nFERC ordered otherwise.\nThere's obviously a range of other issues that\naren't -- aren't governed by FERC rate schedules at all,\nas to which State utility commissions can examine the\nreasonableness of the decisions of the -- of the retail\nbody. But they can't say that -- that following your\nduties under a FERC tariff is unjust and unreasonable.\nThat's a question for FERC.\nQUESTION: In -- in the course of that regular\nexamination that they -- that they do, can they find\ncertain actions that require refunds to the -- to the\nconsumers?\nMR. CARPENTER: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.\nAbsolutely, Your Honor. They can disallow -- they\ndisallow charitable expenses. They disallow expenses all\nthe time. There's a citation --\nQUESTION: But never if it's in violation of a\ntariff or a FERC policy?\nMR. CARPENTER: Right. They cannot, consistent\nwith the Federal Power Act, say that it was imprudent to\ndo -- to -- to do what the FERC tariff required the\nutility to do. That's the clear teaching of MP&L and\nNantahala and -- and other decisions.\nQUESTION: Would the State commission have\nauthority to argue that the formula was incorrectly\napplied?\nMR. CARPENTER: In the context of the retail\nratemaking proceeding?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CARPENTER: No, Your Honor. That's an\nissue exclusively for FERC because, as I pointed out\nbefore, if the rate is believed to be too high, under\nthe tariff, the -- the only remedy the operating company\nwould have would be to go to FERC and -- and complain,\nand the operating company has -- has no -- no right to\nrefuse to make a payment on the ground that there's an\nallegation that the equalization formula was improperly\nimplied.\nBut as I -- as I just said, the filed rate\ndoctrine clearly, you know, prohibited the order here, and\neven if it didn't apply, this is an issue that -- the\nissue of the -- the reasonableness of rates and the\npractices affecting rates is an issue that the Federal\nPower Act clearly allocates to FERC. So even if the\ntariff here didn't, you know, clearly preclude ELI from\ndoing what the LPSC found a prudent company would have\ndone, the -- the filed -- the Federal Power Act preempted\nthe -- the State from addressing the issue.\nAnd the facts of this case sort of illustrate\nwhy States shouldn't get involved in -- in this because\nthe decision that was made here sort of exemplifies the\nparochialism that the Commerce Clause and the Federal\nPower Act was designed to prevent. It was acknowledged by\nthe Louisiana Public Service Commission that the -- the\nunits in question, the out-of-state units in question,\nbenefited Louisiana and the entire system, increased the\nefficiency of the entire system. But it said that was\nirrelevant. In fact, it said that was evidence of\nimprudence because the effect was to increase the costs\nthat ELI incurred and thus to increase retail rates, and\nthat's a -- the kind of parochialism that the\nCommerce Clause prevents and the Federal Power Act was\ndesigned to draw a bright line that would eliminate any\nneed to even adjudicate questions whether the conduct\nviolates the Federal --\nQUESTION: Well, what's left of public service\ncommissions then, if -- if you're right, so far as\npolicing imprudent acquisitions and that sort of thing\nfor a multi -- multistate company?\nMR. CARPENTER: Well, they -- they can't\nregulate issues involving, you know, the exchanges\nof power within power pools, but there are a range\nof other issues that, as I said in response to\nJustice Kennedy's question, that the States can --\ncan decide.\nQUESTION: Such as.\nMR. CARPENTER: Well, the -- you know,\nwhether -- whether expenses not dictated by a FERC -- FERC\nrate schedule are just and reasonable. There's a whole\nrange of other expenses that --\nQUESTION: The cost of -- the cost of power is\njust one of the -- one of the --\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes, just one of the expenses\nthat a retail utility would incur. And -- and so there's\na range of issues that they can decide. What they can't\ndo, though, is -- is decide that it was imprudent to incur\na cost that a FERC rate schedule required the utility to\nincur, and that's the issue here.\nQUESTION: Am I -- am I correct in assuming,\nas I have throughout the -- reading the briefs here,\nthat the -- the costs that a given operating company\nincurs within its power pool is essentially the same\nissue as the wholesale rate that a -- that a totally\nindependent company might pay when it -- when it bought\nwholesale off the -- the grid? Is -- is that a -- it\nseems to me in -- in each case, the operating company\nis buying power at wholesale, whether it does it within\nits group or whether it does it on an open market, and\nthat's what in each case FERC is regulating. Is -- is\nthat fair?\nMR. CARPENTER: Well -- well, FERC regulates the\ntransactions within power pools --\nQUESTION: And when one of those transactions\nis the -- is the -- in effect, the acquisition of power by\na local operating company, that transaction is\neconomically, I guess, the equivalent of buying wholesale\nby an independent company that is not part of a power\npool.\nMR. CARPENTER: Yes, but FERC's jurisdiction\ndepends on the fact that -- jurisdiction depends on the\nexistence of wholesale sales which -- which exist in the\ncontext of a power pool because each retail utility is\nsimultaneously, you know, providing power to the pool at\nthe set rate. So it's --\nQUESTION: Oh, no, I understand that. And --\nand -- but FERC also has general authority over wholesale\ninterstate sales.\nMR. CARPENTER: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nAbsolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So that -- so that in relation to\nwhat a -- the reason I'm getting at it is, in relation to\nwhat a State utilities commission can do, the State\nutilities commission, I take it, is in the same position\nvis-a-vis ELI that it would be if ELI were a totally\nindependent company buying wholesale off the grid. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. CARPENTER: That's right. If it were -- if\nit were subject to the identical rate schedule.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nsave the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Carpenter.\nMr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light,\nthe regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in\ninterstate commerce is exclusively within the jurisdiction\nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Federal\njurisdiction is necessary to ensure that multistate\nutilities, like Entergy and other utilities, are able to\ncarry out their FERC-regulated transactions, to plan and\ncarry out those transactions without the interference of\npotentially conflicting State regulation.\nThe facts of this case highlight the need for\nexclusive Federal regulation. The dispute in this case\ninvolves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the\ncommon benefit of five utilities in four different States.\nThe Louisiana commission believed that the costs allocated\nto Entergy Louisiana were too high, but the consequence of\nthe Louisiana commission's rate decision would be to\nreallocate those costs to ratepayers in Texas, Arkansas,\nMississippi or else to render them trapped and entirely\nunrecoverable.\nQUESTION: Well, does that -- is that a death\nsentence, so to speak, if you find that the costs are\ntrapped and unrecoverable? May not that ever happen to a\nutility legitimately?\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Your Honor. Under\nthis Court's decision in Nantahala, a charge that is\nfederally approved or that is within FERC's exclusive\njurisdiction to approve may not be trapped and disallowed\nby the -- by the State regulatory --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not talking about\ncosts -- trapped costs generally. You're just talking\nabout this particular kind of trapped cost.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right. I'm -- I'm talking\nabout costs that contribute to the wholesale rate that --\nthat is within FERC's jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: So the -- the problem is that -- not\nthat the costs would be trapped, but that FERC has said\nit's not trapped. That's -- that's the point. I mean,\nlots of utilities lose money because costs are trapped.\nMR. SCHLICK: That is -- I -- I think that --\nthat --\nQUESTION: So the real point is here FERC has\nsaid they can do it. That's -- that's the only point that\nyou're making, isn't it?\nMR. SCHLICK: There are two points. There --\nthere is the general prohibition on trapping, but also in\nthis case we have a FERC-approved rate schedule that\ndetermines how the allocation should be carried out.\nThere's a question whether or not Entergy complied with\nthat rate schedule, but the resolution of that question\ninvolves what the wholesale rate is or should be, and\nthat's a question within FERC's jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: And that's a FERC question, period.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right. Only FERC can\ndecide that question.\nUnlike the cases on which respondent relies,\nthis case does not involve a State contract action about a\nmatter that is within the State's concurrent jurisdiction.\nIn the first place, there is no contract dispute between\nthe parties in this case, the Entergy operating companies\nand the holding company.\nRather, this case arose in the same context as\nNantahala and Mississippi Power & Light, a retail rate\nsetting. And the dispute involves the correct division\namong the operating companies in multiple states of costs\nof operating the system. Just like Mississippi Power &\nLight, that's a cost -- that's a -- a question that only\nthe FERC can determine.\nIt's worth mentioning that --\nQUESTION: Could -- could this be\ncharacterized as a question of a reasonable interpretation\nof the tariff, or you couldn't characterize the issue that\nway?\nMR. SCHLICK: There -- there is a -- an\ninterpretation, an underlying question of interpretation,\nof the tariff, but beyond that, there's the question of\nwhether the resulting charge was just and reasonable. And\nthat's the important reasonableness question. That's the\nquestion that only FERC can decide.\nHere the Louisiana commission assumed both that\nthere was a procedural violation of the system agreement\nin -- in the documentation of the operating committee's\ndecision --\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. SCHLICK:\nwas unjust and unreasonable.\nQUESTION: But what Louisiana is saying, they --\nthey're conceding that FERC has the authority, the\nexclusive authority, to prescribe what the division would\nbe. However, they're saying if, in fact, there's a\nviolation of that division, the States ought to be able to\nadjudicate the violation. They're still giving FERC all\nof -- all of its power. They're saying FERC decides what\nthe division will be, but the State agency can determine\nthat the division has not been carried out the way FERC\nprescribed.\nWhat is there in the act that -- that says that\nFERC is the exclusive adjudicator of whether its\ndirectives have been complied with?\nMR. SCHLICK: In the context of what the\nwholesale charge is or should be, the provision of the act\nis section 824d and -- and 824e. The underlying principle\nwas established by this Court's decision in Attleboro,\nwhich is that States are entirely disabled from regulating\nwholesale rates. That was implemented through the Federal\nPower Act in 1935. It was confirmed in this Court's\ndecision --\nQUESTION: They're not regulating the\nwholesale rates is what -- is the argument that will\nbe made by the State.\nFERC to regulate it, but they're adjudicating whether\nthe rates prescribed by -- by FERC have, in fact, been\nthe rates charged.\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, in fact, they\nwere regulating the wholesale charge. The necessary\ndetermination of the Louisiana commission's order was\nthat the costs pass through under the Federal rate\nschedule to Entergy Louisiana. The specific costs\nallocated on the rate schedule were too high. It was\nimprudent in the Louisiana commission's judgment for\nEntergy Louisiana --\nQUESTION: I thought the Court said in\nMississippi Power & Light that once FERC sets a wholesale\nrate, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates\nthat the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.\nMR. SCHLICK: That -- That's correct. The --\nQUESTION: So I guess that's the law, isn't it?\nMR. SCHLICK: -- the only additional step that\nneed be taken in this -- in this case is to determine\nwhether the fact that there is a dispute as to whether or\nnot the FERC rate schedule was violated somehow puts the\ncase within the State's jurisdiction. That was the\nquestion that only FERC can answer.\nQUESTION: But how is that different from the\nState determining that a retail rate is unreasonable?\nMR. SCHLICK: We believe it's precisely the\nsame.\nQUESTION: So then there is nothing extra.\nMR. SCHLICK: Our -- our answer to that question\nis there is no difference.\nQUESTION: So I have to see what the other side\nwould say.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: I -- I take it you agree with\nMr. Carpenter that the State can be heard on this issue as\nan intervenor who may raise the issue before FERC. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. SCHLICK: Not just as an intervenor. Under\nsection 825e of the act, the State could actually bring a\ncomplaint --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. SCHLICK: -- to FERC. It could bring the\nissue directly to FERC. And --\nQUESTION: In any case, it can get to FERC if it\nhas a gripe.\nMR. SCHLICK: The order 415 proceeding in\n1997 -- that was resolved in 1997 -- shows exactly how\nthis should happen. The --\nQUESTION: No, but the answer to my question is\nyes, isn't it?\nMR. SCHLICK: Oh, yes, absolutely.\nQUESTION: That's all I'm -- that's all I'm --\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me it's quite a\ndifferent question. Question one is whether the\nallocation was unreasonable, and the State here is saying\nwe're -- we're not questioning the reasonableness of the\nallocation. That's up to FERC. But we don't think that\nwe were charged that allocation that -- that was given to\nus. And that's -- that's not challenging FERC's decision\nof what the allocation should be. It's challenging the\nfactual question of whether the allocation was carried out\nthe way FERC prescribed.\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, the order 415\nproceeding shows precisely the problem with that. In that\ncase, FERC said that there was a violation of the system\nagreement, analogous to the one that's being claimed here.\nBut it also said that the resulting charge was just and\nreasonable. In fact, ratepayers benefited overall from\nwhat was done by Entergy.\nQUESTION: Must be a section of the FERC rules\nor regs or tariffs which says the company may -- must --\nor must pass over to the company that has the higher\nnumber of generators a charge equal to the amount, da, da,\nda, that this particular thing we have before it gives the\nallocation for.\nMR. SCHLICK: Well, the -- the rate schedule\nhas been approved --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SCHLICK: -- by FERC and --\nQUESTION: All right --\nMR. SCHLICK: -- there's a requirement --\nQUESTION: -- it says that in the rate schedule.\nMR. SCHLICK: -- and there's a requirement to\nthe comply with rate schedule.\nQUESTION: So the rate schedule of FERC says\ncharge a rate --\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- based on this allocation.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right.\nQUESTION: All right. All right. I'll ask the\nother side. I don't see any room for the question that\nwas just raised.\nMR. SCHLICK: If the Court has no further\nquestions.\nQUESTION: I -- I do. I mean, what -- what\nhappens if the -- the State says, they haven't charged it\naccording to that allocation?\nQUESTION: Then Mississippi --\nQUESTION: Well, let counsel answer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, what -- what\nhappens is then the question becomes was the resulting\ncharge just and reasonable. In order 415, FERC determined\nthe resulting charge after a violation of the rate\nschedule was just and reasonable. In fact, ratepayers in\nLouisiana benefited from what Entergy did, notwithstanding\nthat it wasn't in compliance with the terms of the rate\nschedule at that time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.\nMr. Fontham, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. FONTHAM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FONTHAM: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe issue in this case is the following. The\nFERC approved a contract amendment that established\nconditions, procedures before a utility could bill an\naffiliate for units in mothballs. The utility failed to\nfollow the procedures, failed to consider the conditions,\nand failed to record the decision in its minutes, as it\nwas required to do, and then said to the LPSC --\nQUESTION: We're -- we're within about 15 feet\nof you, Mr. Fontham. You don't have to speak up.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FONTHAM:\nAnd then said to the LPSC, you must take the\ncharges anyway.\nQUESTION: Yes, I think that's right under the\nlaw, isn't it?\nMR. FONTHAM: No, it's not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. FONTHAM: Because the issue in this case is\na drastic departure from what this Court held in MP&L or\nin Nantahala. In that --\nQUESTION: Because? Okay, that's exactly --\nMR. FONTHAM: In those cases --\nQUESTION: Yes. To get the question very\nprecise, that is the question. In MP&L, it said once FERC\nsets a rate, which means, I take it, that they have the\nterms that we've just described in the tariffs, a State\nmay not conclude in setting retail rates that the\nFERC-approved rates are unreasonable.\nMR. FONTHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, what's the\ndifference between that and what you just said?\nMR. FONTHAM: The -- the difference is that the\nFERC set the rate. The utility couldn't bill for the\nunits because it hadn't gone through the procedure under\nthe FERC rate. The utility billed anyway. It says if the\nrate said 5, the utility sends a bill for 10. 10 shows up\nin the retail rate case.\nThe question is, can the State agency, looking\nat the FERC tariff and looking at what the utility billed,\nmake the decision, instead of the utility making the\ndecision, in the State proceeding that it's wrong.\nQUESTION: That's the question --\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe it can if FERC has not\npreviously adjudicated that very question.\nMR. FONTHAM: And it hasn't.\nQUESTION: I mean, here what -- what they're\ncontending is that FERC not only prescribed the formula,\nbut that in order 415, it adjudicated that the formula had\nbeen properly applied or, if improperly applied, close\nenough for Government work is what they said. And once\nthey decided that, their contention is, it's not up to the\nState to second-guess them.\nMR. FONTHAM: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- that\nmay be what they're saying, but that's not what happened\nin the case. The -- in the case the FERC did refuse to\norder refunds. It held that the utility had invalidly\nexercised its, quote/unquote, discretion to violate a\nclear and ambiguous tariff for 10 years.\nThen it said, we're going to have a new tariff.\nWe're going to curb the utilities' discretion. We're\ngoing to require the utility to have a procedure. We were\nsaying it is too -- it was too vague, but no, no. The\nutilities said, our discretion will be curbed. The FERC\nsaid, their discretion will be curbed. The Court of\nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit said their discretion will be\ncurbed.\nQUESTION: Didn't FERC -- didn't FERC also say\nthat the rates that had resulted during the period prior\nto the amendment were just and reasonable rates?\nMR. FONTHAM: The FERC said that looking\nretroactively, in effect, retroactively --\nQUESTION: Absolutely. They're looking\nretroactively.\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: And having done so, and having set\nthe rate, how then is a State utilities commission, in\neffect, able to go behind that determination?\nMR. FONTHAM: Because the costs that were\nincurred and are at issue here -- actually, I lost that\nissue before the LPSC. The LPSC, as to all the charges up\nuntil August 1997, said since the FERC retroactively\neffectively changed the filed rate -- I don't know how\nthey can do that, but they did -- they retroactively\napproved a new filed rate. You -- we can't touch that.\nThen the LPSC said, okay, now we've got a new\ncontract amendment that operates prospectively. And what\ndoes it require? Take a look at what it requires. This\nwas in -- litigated issue. And the LPSC says, well, they\ndidn't follow the conditions again.\nQUESTION: But wait. Can you please go back and\nexplain to me my question?\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: To use your example --\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- we have, I mean, it sounds to me\nthat what you're saying is a revolution in rate conditions\nor setting in the United States. I've always understood\nit to be, because of the sentence of MPL that I read to\nyou, that if FERC says we have a piece of paper here that\neither directly or through a formula makes clear that $5\nof your cost, your total cost for the consumer, is correct\nway to determine an interstate part of it, then when the\nlocal commission looks at the $10 rate to the consumer, it\ncan do what it wants, but it has to take that $5 as a\ngiven.\nMR. FONTHAM: We did that.\nQUESTION: Now, if the commission thinks that\nthe $5 that the company put on its line as part of the\ninterstate payment did not comply with every condition,\ndid not satisfy the law because it was unjust and\nunreasonable, their remedy is to go to FERC and to say,\nFERC, they didn't comply with your conditions. They\nlet -- got an unreasonable rate. That the commission's\nremedy -- the local commission -- is not to readjudicate\nthat itself.\nAnd the -- the legal authority for what I've\njust said I've always thought was the sentence I read to\nyou out of MP&L. Now, where am I wrong in that?\nMR. FONTHAM: You are wrong, Your Honor, in\nthis. MP&L says that the State commission has to take\nthe 5. If the tariff says 5, it has to take the 5.\nQUESTION: That's what I said.\nMR. FONTHAM: We're dealing with the\nextra 5 here. We're dealing with the overcharge, the\noverbilling, the violation of the contract.\nQUESTION: The extra 5. Now, I thought what we\nwere dealing with here was a formula set out by what I\nused to call the FPC, which -- which formula said that\nthe 5 is made up of many things. One of those things is\na charge that the Louisiana company is to pay to a company\nin a different State to reflect the fact that that company\nin the different State has generators in reserve capacity\nthat serve everybody, and among those generators are\ngenerators that were put in mothballs provided that they\nnoted in the minutes of the joint company, et cetera that\nthis is a mothballed generator available for reserve\ncapacity if necessary.\nAll right, and if I understand it correctly and\nI've said it correctly, then the cost at issue here is\npart of the 5, not part of the other 5.\nMR. FONTHAM: I'll give you that, Your Honor.\nThe -- but the -- but the problem and the difference is\nthat -- there was a little more in the tariff condition.\nIt said you have to have a plan to return the unit to\nservice.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. FONTHAM: Did they have that? No. It\nsaid --\nQUESTION: No, but now we're repeating because\nI -- I just said that if you think that the minutes were\nnot filled, if you think one of the other conditions that\nwas put forth in that particular tariff, which I guess\nis -- what is -- page 57 or something of the -- of -- but\nif you think one of those was not fulfilled, then your\nremedy is to go to the FPC -- the FERC rather.\nMR. FONTHAM: And then -- and that poses the\nquestion beautifully because we're in a State ratemaking\nproceeding and now we know the question. Does the State\nget to interpret the tariff and decide what it means and\nwhat it says, or does the utility? Because the FERC is\nnot here to tell us.\nrates today? The utility's decision based on a violation\nof the tariff which was litigated through the Louisiana\ncourts? They got to eat the cake, but now they're back\nbecause they didn't like the taste of the cake, to put\nit --\nQUESTION: Mr. Fontham, I'm a little confused on\nwho is the they because my understanding was that the\nLouisiana company, ELI, had no say in this, that it was\nthe Entergy, the -- the holding company -- the -- for all\nof these five companies, that gave the instructions. And\nit wasn't as though ELI could say, well, we think you\nallocated too much to us. You're making us pay too much.\nThe -- each unit is bound by what Entergy says. So the\nthey seems to me to be Entergy, but the Louisiana Public\nService Commission has only ELI before it.\nMR. FONTHAM: That's true, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So how can it say that ELI was at\nfault for something that ELI is locked into by virtue of\nbeing part of this multistate --\nMR. FONTHAM: What -- what the commission says\nis that ELI is at fault in the sense of any utility, going\nback to -- to Justice Souter's reference to two\nindependent companies in a wholesale power transaction.\nNow, we all know you can go to court to enforce a\nwholesale tariff, and that's where most people go.\nIn the case of a parent-subsidiary relationship,\nwell, obviously the parent gets to tell the subsidiary\nwhat to do. That's true in everything. It's true of many\ncost allocations that we see. We see hundreds of millions\nof dollars of cost allocations coming into Louisiana based\non Entergy's decisions under innumerable types of\nallocation schemes, including the Federal tariff.\nAnd ELI has an obligation, even though it's\nowned by a parent, to make sure the parent follows the\nterms of the tariff, just as the wholesale buyer of\npower --\nQUESTION: I'm beginning to understand your\nargument. Is this what it is? That you'd -- imagine we\nhave a Federal FERC rule, and it says you can include in\nyour -- in your charge to the wholesale company the charge\nof sending a salesman to the foreign State to tell him\nabout your product. All right? And now we have -- now we\nhave -- you go before the State commission and the company\nsays, and it costs me $117 to send Mr. Smith to do that.\nAnd you want to say, I, of course, am forbidden\nfrom arguing to you, the State commission, that they\nviolated the tariff. But I can tell you that this\nsalesman, named Murphy, actually spent most of his time in\na chicken restaurant, and therefore, what he did for that\n117 fell outside the tariff.\ntariff. It fell outside the tariff.\nAnd similarly, you want to say here that the\ncost of the generator in mothballs did not violate the\ntariff to include it, but rather fell outside the tariff\nbecause they never had the minutes, et cetera. Is that\nwhat you're arguing?\nMR. FONTHAM: I'm arguing both, Your Honor,\nbecause --\nQUESTION: Well, what's both? If you say --\nMR. FONTHAM: Well --\nQUESTION: If you say you're arguing it violated\nthe tariff, you have an additional problem which is that\nthe Louisiana Public Service Commission itself said that\nthe staff wants us to say this violated the FERC tariff,\nbut we have no power to do that.\nMR. FONTHAM: No. That -- that was as to the\nrefunds. That was as to the period going up to 1996.\nQUESTION: No. No.\nMR. FONTHAM: But -- but, Your Honor, let me --\nlet me take this and put it in -- in context here. When a\nState commission decides issues of intrastate ratemaking,\nit decides all kinds of questions of Federal law. It has\nto decide what the Internal Revenue Code requires. It has\nto decide what the consolidated tax return provides for.\nIt has to decide SEC allocations that are filed with the\nSEC.\nSo along comes a situation that's completely\nwithin its expertise. What does a FERC tariff require?\nAnd it makes so many decisions involving millions and\nmillions of dollars in which it -- it decides as -- as any\nother State court. You apply Federal law, you apply State\nlaw. It's the whole body of law that you're dealing with.\nQUESTION: Except that FERC specifically\naddressed this question.\nMR. FONTHAM: No, Your Honor. The FERC did not\naddress this question. This is tariff 2. Tariff 1 the\nFERC did address and it said the utility violated the\ntariff.\nNow we're on tariff 2, and tariff 2 was\ndesigned, according to the FERC, to curb the utility's\ndiscretion. And -- and that tariff 2, designed to curb\nthe utility's discretion, the utility then immediately\nproceeded to ignore. And even in their reply brief, they\nsay, we did nothing more than we ever did before. That's\non the first page of their reply brief.\nQUESTION: But isn't the way to look at the\nproblem this way? FERC says you may charge a certain\ntariff. We're not coming up with the actual number now --\nMR. FONTHAM: No.\nQUESTION:\nwill vary over time. You may -- we -- we are approving a\ntariff. You supply the number and you must supply the\nnumber according to certain conditions. And what the\nLouisiana commission is now saying is, the number that you\nsupplied was a number that violates those conditions.\nMR. FONTHAM: Right. That's true.\nQUESTION: The fact remains that on the face of\nit, FERC has said, if you come up with the number, that's\nthe tariff. So if you are going to challenge that number,\naren't you, in effect, challenging a FERC determination?\nAnd to do that, don't you have to go back to FERC and say,\nthey didn't follow your conditions, and therefore you,\nFERC, should tell them that that number is, in fact, wrong\nand they can't charge it?\nMR. FONTHAM: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: What's wrong with that analysis?\nMR. FONTHAM: -- I -- I don't think that's\ncorrect. I do think that your predicate is correct.\nThey -- they -- the FERC gave them a tariff. That's the\ntariff. The utility's decision doesn't become the tariff.\nIt's like any contract case. If I have a contract with\nyou, and I can charge you 5, and I send you a bill for 10,\nthat doesn't -- my 10 doesn't become the tariff.\nQUESTION: Right, except that in this case --\nand -- and maybe this is where I'm going wrong. Tell me\nif I am. In this case, I thought FERC did not say the\nnumber is 5.\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes. It said -- what it said\nwas -- is, you go through this process, step 1, step 2,\nstep 3 --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. FONTHAM: -- step 4. The utility did none\nof that.\nQUESTION: No, but -- but at the end -- but what\nFERC is saying is, if -- if you go through that process,\nthe number you get at the end of the process is what our\ntariff guarantees you to charge.\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, that's true.\nQUESTION: And in this case, you're saying -- so\nthat -- so that the -- FERC is not saying what the number\nis in advance. It's setting the process in advance.\nMR. FONTHAM: Right.\nQUESTION: And what you're saying is, sure, they\ncame up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them\nthey could do, but they didn't go through the right\nprocess to get it, and therefore the number's no good.\nBut in order to say the number is no good, you're still\nchallenging something which, at least on its face, has\nbeen authorized by FERC. And therefore, why isn't the\nappropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and\nsay, the number they're claiming under your authority is\nthe wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?\nMR. FONTHAM: Okay. I'll -- I'll answer the\nlast question first. The reason the appropriate action\nfor the LPSC to take is not to go to FERC is because the\nLPSC has the authority as part of its State ratemaking\nauthority, as part of State law to make --\nQUESTION: Yes, but that's the question here.\nThat's the question here.\nMR. FONTHAM: That's the question.\nQUESTION: Do they have it or is it preempted?\nMR. FONTHAM: Well, it wasn't preempted --\nQUESTION: And one question as to whether it's\npreempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the\nFederal ratemaker and -- and, in fact, get the relief that\nthey want. That's something we ought to consider.\nMR. FONTHAM: And, Your Honor, the -- our\nposition is -- and I believe it's correct -- that there's\nnothing in the Federal Power Act that preempts the State\nfrom doing this, that the only FERC jurisdiction to decide\nenforcement issues didn't even -- they created it in 1980\napproximately. They were told in 16 U.S.C. 825m that if\nthey found a violation of a tariff, they had to go to\nUnited States District Court.\nAnd there's nothing in the Federal Power Act.\nIn fact, the Senate had a provision in the Federal Power\nAct that the FERC can award remedies for violations of its\norders. It was pulled out.\nQUESTION: In other words, they --\nQUESTION: Okay. You're talking about the\ncondition today, and what you're saying today is, whenever\nFERC sets a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to\nbe filled in later, a State utility commission in a\nratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line\nnumber in its own bailiwick.\nMR. FONTHAM: No, Your Honor. We're saying that\nif there's a tariff --\nQUESTION: I thought that's what you were doing.\nMR. FONTHAM: -- and it sets forth objective\nrequirements, and it -- and the utility doesn't follow\nthose objective requirements, then they're not entitled to\nbill for the units. That's all we're saying. We're\nnot -- this is not --\nQUESTION: All that you're saying is that\nJustice Souter was wrong to limit it to places where the\nFederal tariff is open. It's just as applicable to\ninstances where the Federal tariff is specific. And\nyou're saying that Congress in the Federal Power Act set\nup an act where you have a single central Federal body to\nprovide tariffs for, let's say, the billions and billions\nof kilowatt hours made every year, but that each State --\n50 or 51 different local service commissions are going to\nadjudicate whether or not those millions of words are, in\nfact, violated and what we will have is 51 separate\ndecisionmaking bodies to determine when a FERC tariff has\nbeen violated.\nNow, I grant you Congress did not say in the\nact, and we don't mean to do that. But it would be an\nawfully surprising thing for them to want to do.\nMR. FONTHAM: They did say we don't want to do\nthat. It's in -- it's in the introduction.\nQUESTION: Well, if they said they don't want to\ndo it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?\nMR. FONTHAM: I'm saying that they -- well,\nmaybe I misunderstood what they don't want to do, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: I mean, don't want to do that is --\nmeans that they don't want 51 bodies --\nMR. FONTHAM: Okay, they didn't --\nQUESTION: -- adjudicating the correctness of\nthe application of rules for wholesale rates that are\ncontained of thousands or millions of words filed before\nthe Federal Power Commission.\nMR. FONTHAM: They -- they --\nQUESTION:\nPower Act did not want to have 51 adjudicative bodies, but\nrather wanted to have one centralized body that States\nwere free to use.\nMR. FONTHAM: Not -- not at all.\nQUESTION: No, okay.\nMR. FONTHAM: What the Federal Power Act says is\nthere's one central body to make the rate, to establish\nthe reasonable and just terms of the rate. All the courts\nin the United States can decide whether a tariff is\nviolated, including the State courts, and that's the way\nit always has been. In fact, the FERC wouldn't hear the\ncases until 1979.\nIf there was a case of a tariff violation\npending in State court, you had the potential, this\npotential of possible loss of uniformity, which never\nreally happened. As a matter of fact, this is a\nhigh-profile case. Where are the conflicting decisions?\nAnd the reason is we have an objective tariff. They\nviolated the objective tariff. Nobody can really dispute\nthat. It was litigated in the lower courts.\nQUESTION: Mr. Fontham -- Mr. Fontham, there are\nfive States in this and there could be more in a regional\norganization.\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION:\ncommission can do what the Louisiana commission has done,\nyou could have chaos.\nMR. FONTHAM: No.\nQUESTION: One will say, my utility was\nunderpaid. Another one will say, ours was overpaid. And\neach one could do exactly what the Louisiana commission\nhas done. It -- it seems to me that that just cries out\nfor having the one decisionmaker, FERC.\nMR. FONTHAM: Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I\nwill respectfully disagree that this as big a problem\nas -- as you are suggesting. And I'll -- I'll tell you\nthat literally billions of dollars of costs are split up\nby Entergy among its companies, only a very small sliver\nunder the Federal Power Act. Now, they split up these\ncosts from Energy Operations, which is a nuclear company;\nEnergy Services, which is a service company, by allocating\nthem into the jurisdictions. Anytime there would be a\nconflicting decision, you could have -- supposedly you\ncould have chaos. What really happens is the utility\ntries to shove as much costs as it possibly can into the\njurisdictions which are reviewing the rates frequently.\nQUESTION: But -- but your answer to Justice\nGinsburg and your earlier answer to Justice Breyer, with\nreference to whether there is a preemptive effect in the,\nwhat we might call, the enforcement --\nMR. FONTHAM: Right.\nQUESTION: -- or interpretation phase of the --\nof the tariff, it seems to me is contrary to what we said\nin Mississippi Power. We -- we actually were quoting\nNantahala. There we said the Mississippi Supreme Court\nerred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of\nFERC jurisdiction turns on whether a particular matter was\nactually determined in FERC proceedings. We have long\nrejected this sort of case-by-case analysis of the impact\nof State regulation upon the national interest.\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and bear\nin mind what Justice Stevens was addressing there. The\nissue of prudence -- and the Court were addressing, but\nthe issue of prudence is an issue is that comes up in\nmaking the rate. The FERC in the Federal Power Act is --\nis authorized to establish just and reasonable rates. If\nyou're going to raise prudence, you raise it in the\nproceeding where the just and reasonable rate gets\nestablished. We admit they have that.\nThen you have the next question. If they start\nviolating their contract, is that something that the\nStates can't look at? And there's nothing in the Federal\nPower Act that suggests that States --\nQUESTION: Well, but it was violating the\ncontract in -- in a context where FERC had -- had looked\nat that -- that specific violation, and it -- and it\nannounced the remedy.\nMR. FONTHAM: No. The prior violation. This is\nthe second tariff, Your Honor. This is a new tariff that\nsets conditions which were supposedly designed to curb\ntheir discretion.\nBut going back to MP&L, this Court's decision\naffirmed the decision of the Mississippi Public Service\nCommission. It reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court.\nIt affirmed the Mississippi Public Service Commission.\nIn -- in that decision of the Mississippi Public Service\nCommission, 327 million will be incurred under the FERC\ntariff. They -- they had to actually estimate what would\nbe incurred.\nNow, if you hand the utility the right to tell\nthe State public service commission that, oh, it will be\n500 million, do they have to pass it through? If this\nCourt is going to give the sword of preemption to\nutilities, and basically, there's a test, you know. We've\ngot concurrent jurisdiction. The test for concurrent\njurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction is unmistakable\nintent of Congress. Congress had it in there, pulled it\nout of the -- in the Senate report. The FERC can -- can\nhear violations. It was in the Senate version of the bill\nin 1935.\nthat the Senate pulled it out. The FERC had no -- no --\njurisdiction to hear tariff violation cases. It could go\nto court. That's 16 U.S.C., section 825m.\nIn about 1980, the FERC said, well, you know\nwhat? We're going to infer the power to do that. And for\nthe first time ever, because up until then, the FERC had\nbeen refusing to hear cases that were pending in State\ncourt, wouldn't even exercise primary jurisdiction. Now,\nobviously, if you have exclusive jurisdiction, there's no\nneed for a primary jurisdiction doctrine. They wouldn't\neven exercise primary jurisdiction. They left it to the\nState courts, all the State courts.\nNow, if you leave it to the State courts, what\nis -- how can you possibly say a State ratemaking agency,\nwhich decides issues of Federal law, contracts, all the\ntime, has to interpret allocations, has to decide if\nthey're right -- how could the Federal Power Act have\ntaken away their power when the Federal Power Act was\npassed --\nQUESTION: Well, I want to be sure I get a\nresponse to this, though, because you said before -- and\nthis very interesting argument might be cut short if the\nparagraph that I read to you is applied to the 19 --\npost-1965 costs, which I -- aren't they the costs that\nwere at issue when -- when the staff was talking about\ndisallowing costs?\nMR. FONTHAM: The post-1997 --\nQUESTION: No. The post -- the -- there's the\npost-'65 or -- what --\nMR. FONTHAM: August -- it's August 5th, 1997.\nQUESTION: But -- yes.\nMR. FONTHAM: You have -- you have costs\nincurred in '96, which interestingly enough, were incurred\nin violation of a FERC tariff as determined by the FERC.\nQUESTION: Yes, yes, that's right. I understand\nthat.\nMR. FONTHAM: As determined by the FERC.\nQUESTION: But they are -- but it's -- it's the\n'97 costs we're talking about here.\nMR. FONTHAM: Going forward. That's correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and when they're talking\nabout this, it seemed as if they're talking about\npost-August 5th, 1997 costs on page 64a, 65a.\nMR. FONTHAM: Right. That's when the new\ntariff --\nQUESTION: Are you sure they're not?\nMR. FONTHAM: That's when the new tariff became\neffective.\nQUESTION: Yes. But you know what I'm thinking\nof on page 64a and 65a of your appendix.\nMR. FONTHAM: I don't, but I'll be happy to\nlook.\nQUESTION: I'm a little puzzled by your\nreference to the new tariff. I thought the --\nQUESTION: It's -- it's -- they have a -- B, is\nthis committee precluded from determining whether the\noperating committee's decision was in compliance with the\namended section 10.02 of the system agreement?\nMR. FONTHAM: It's the amendment. Yes. The\namendment took effect August 5th, 19 --\nQUESTION: Yes, and they're talking about the\npost-August 5th, aren't they?\nMR. FONTHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. Then they say, LPSC staff\nargues that the MS-1 overpayment should be disallowed\nbecause the decision violated the FERC tariff. As ELI\nargues, this commission is preempted from determining\nwhether the terms of a FERC tariff have been met, for the\nissue of violation or compliance with a FERC tariff is\npeculiarly within FERC's purview. Any allegation of a\nviolation of a FERC tariff should, therefore, be brought\nbefore FERC.\nAll right. I read that and thought they seem\nnot to have decided this on the basis that you've been\narguing it.\nMR. FONTHAM: Your Honor, I believe they did\ndecide it on the basis that I've been arguing, but I'll\nconcede that that language is sitting in there. It's\nwrong. And --\nQUESTION: You mean it's wrong as a matter of\nlaw? It's wrong at describing what they thought?\nMR. FONTHAM: It's wrong. I think it relates\nto the refunds, but it's wrong as a matter of this Court's\nlaw, the fact that there was a primary jurisdiction\ndoctrine, the fact that the States have always had the\npower to decide this, the fact that the FERC had to\ninfer jurisdiction to decide tariff violations in the --\nin around 1979 or 1980. The FERC has never had\nexclusive jurisdiction to decide if a contract has been\nviolated.\nThe Arkla against Hall case. That case is a\ncase that came through the -- this -- the Louisiana\ncourts. This Court held there's a difference between\nestablishing the just and reasonable rate and enforcing\nthe contract.\nAnd if you go back to the -- the Pan American\ncase decided by this Court, this Court held that with\nregard to contract enforcement issues, which somebody was\narguing need to be decided by the FERC, there was a State\nproceeding pending.\nQUESTION: Why is this a contract enforcement\nproceeding? I don't follow.\nMR. FONTHAM: Because, Your Honor, the -- it's a\ncontract. This is one of the sections of the contract.\nThis is the section that -- it's an amendment to the\ncontract that was approved by the FERC. It's a contract\nbetween the parties --\nQUESTION: A contract between whom?\nMR. FONTHAM: Pardon?\nQUESTION: Who is the -- who are the parties to\nthis contract?\nMR. FONTHAM: The parties to the contract are\nthe five operating companies, plus --\nQUESTION: But you agreed with me earlier that\nthe operating companies have to follow the instructions of\nEntergy.\nMR. FONTHAM: Only by virtue of the fact that\nEntergy -- not under the contract, not because the\ncontract says so. They don't have to take an illegal\ncharge. But as a matter of practice, I admit that the\nbig boss of Entergy can tell the operating companies\nwhat to do, and they're not going to lose their jobs\nover it. So they'll take the charge if it's an\novercharge. You're darned right. But not because\nthe contract says so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is this contract the contract that\nhas been accepted by and approved by FERC and, in effect,\nincorporated into the tariff?\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So that we're not talking about a\nfreestanding contract.\nMR. FONTHAM: We're --\nQUESTION: We're talking, in effect, about a\nterm which the tariff incorporates by its reference to the\ncontract.\nMR. FONTHAM: We are -- we are really -- the\ncontract itself --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't --\nMR. FONTHAM: -- more or less becomes the\ntariff, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Right. That's --\nMR. FONTHAM: There is no separate tariff. It's\njust a contract. It becomes a rate schedule filed with\nthe FERC. But in Pan American, this Court said, you\nknow, in -- in its nature -- by its nature, a contract\nlike that is a State court contract. And the -- and the\nCourt made the statement by the fact that everybody knows\nthere's a scheme of Federal regulation doesn't change\nthat. And the State courts -- and I think it implicitly\nmeans this --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Fontham.\nMR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. CARPENTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Mr. Carpenter, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nMR. CARPENTER: Unless the Court has any further\nquestions, I have nothing else I need to add.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\nMr. Carpenter.\n"
