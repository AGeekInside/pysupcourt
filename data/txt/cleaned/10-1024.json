FEIGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FEIGIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf Congress had intended to waive the\nsovereign immunity of the United States to allow\nuncapped emotional distress claims under the Privacy\nAct, it would have and was required to state that waiver\nclearly and unambiguously in the statutory text.\nThe substantive requirements of the Act\nsweep far beyond any pre-existing common law protection\nof privacy to impose a detailed set of new and pervasive\nrequirements on the collection, maintenance, use, and\ndissemination of millions of Federal agency records.\nThe Act, for example, forbids agencies from keeping too\nmuch information about an individual; compels agencies\nto collect information about an individual, when\npracticable, from the individual himself and not from\nother sources; and can require agencies to safeguard\ninformation about an individual even when that\ninformation is otherwise already publicly available.\nCongress would not have taken lightly the\nquestion of whether to expose the United States to\nexpansive damages for intentional or willful violations\nof these novel recordkeeping requirements. Indeed, the\nway in which the district court believed that the Social\nSecurity Administration violated the Privacy Act in this\ncase is something that never would have been actionable\nat common law and never would have resulted in emotional\ndistress recovery.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then maybe Congress\nshouldn't have passed this statute. But the injury, the\ninvasion of privacy, that's not something where\npecuniary damages are -- are prime if they exist at all.\nI mean, this is -- the -- the tort that this is\ncomparable to is intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. The -- the person who is subject to this, to\nthis embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have\nout-of-pocket costs but is terribly distressed, nervous,\nanxious, and all the rest.\nThe -- the act that the Congress is\nreaching, the impact of it is of that nature, not -- I\nmean, pecuniary damages do not ordinarily attend conduct\nthat embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental\ndistress.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Justice\nGinsburg, I'd like to respectfully disagree with the\npremise of the question that the Privacy Act is\ncomparable to common law invasion of privacy. All the\nrequirements I just described that are under the Privacy\nAct would not have existed at common law invasion of\nprivacy even though common law invasion of privacy was,\nas you say, compensable with emotional distress awards.\nIn fact, even if we focus just on the disclosure-related\nprovision of the Privacy Act, it itself is much broader\nthan common law invasion of privacy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if it is -- even if\nit is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a\npecuniary kind. So, you could say that Congress was\nmuch more generous than the common law was, but the\nimpact on the person who is suing is not going to be\nout-of-pocket business loss, pecuniary loss; it's going\nto be the embarrassment, the humiliation. So, it's --\nit's -- if Congress wanted to do something about the\nimpact on the person it has given a right, it's not\ngoing to do something that has to do with pecuniary\ndamages which it's not likely the person in -- in this\nplaintiff's situation is not likely to suffer.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nthere sometimes are, as there were at common law,\npecuniary damages resulting from either violations of\nthe Privacy Act or invasions of privacy; and the\ngovernment sometimes pays out very large pecuniary\njudgments.\nBut to get to the core of your question\nabout why Congress might not in the Privacy Act have\nprovided an emotional distress award, I think the text\nof the Act demonstrates that Congress thought about the\npossibility of providing an emotional distress award,\nbut decided not to do that in the initial version of the\nAct that it passed in 1974. Instead, that version of\nthe Act in section 5(c)(2)(B)(iii) assigned to the\nPrivacy Protection Study Commission the task of making a\nrecommendation as to whether the Act should later be\nexpanded to provide for general damages.\nThe commission understood its mission to\ndetermine -- was to determine whether the Act ought to\nbe expanded to provide for dignitary and reputational\nharms, such as compensation for emotional distress. And\nthe Privacy Commission further understood that the Act\nas it had been enacted provided only for actual damages,\nwhich it interpreted as synonymous with special damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the -- why --\nis -- is a harm to a dignitary interest, is that an\nactual injury?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You describe that\ninjury -- I mean, it is an injury, the emotional\ndistress, the humiliation. Is that an actual injury?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, the term \"actual\ninjury\" and the term \"actual damages\" -- those are\nambiguous terms. Sometimes they might include emotional\ndistress, and sometimes they might not. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this\ncase. Did the plaintiff suffer an actual injury?\nMR. FEIGIN: He did not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At least, did he allege\nthat he had suffered an actual injury?\nMR. FEIGIN: He did not suffer actual\ndamages within the meaning of the Privacy Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't -- I didn't ask\nyou that. I asked you, did he suffer an actual injury,\nas opposed to someone who is complaining about\nsomething -- an abstract right or an abstract theory?\nIs there an actual injury here?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think my\ndifficulty with the question is that I don't think the\nterm \"actual injury\" has some plain meaning out of\ncontext. And the term that the Privacy Act uses is\n\"actual damages.\" I think in the context of the Privacy\nAct, as well as in other contexts --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you have to have an\ninjury first before you can get damages. So, my\nquestion is, was there an injury?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, if Your Honor's question\nis whether he suffered an adverse effect within the\nmeaning of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FEIGIN: -- section (g)(1)(D) of the\nAct, yes, we believe he did suffer an adverse effect\nsufficient to confer standing. But this Court in Doe\ndescribed the adverse effect requirement as simply\ncodifying the Article III standing requirements and made\nvery clear that simply because a plaintiff may have\nsuffered an adverse effect, that doesn't mean that the\nplaintiff suffered actual damages. But,\nJustice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little bit\nconfused by that because in your brief, the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version\nof general damages in the following way -- and I'm\nquoting from your brief there: \"The general damages\nprovision in the Senate bill likely derived from the\ncommon law of tort of invasion of privacy where general\ndamages may be awarded as\" -- quote -- \"'presumed\ndamages,' without proof of harm.\"\nSo, I think there in Doe you argued that\ngeneral damages presumed injury. But that's very\ndifferent than, I think, the question Justice Ginsburg\nwas asking you. It's -- and I read your brief and your\narguments as sort of an -- an assumption that if you\nsuffer nonpecuniary harm, you haven't been injured.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's a big difference\nbetween presumed damages and proven injury. In Gertz,\nwe reference the common law tort as requiring actual\nproof of injury for emotional distress. Most State laws\nsay you have to prove the emotional distress. We're not\npresuming the injury. So, I guess what I'm saying to\nyou, aren't you the one confusing what injury is from\npresumed damage?\nMR. FEIGIN: I hope not, Your Honor. But\nthe -- the -- I think to get at your question, what we\nsaid in the Doe brief is that general damages are a type\nof presumed damages, and that's correct under the common\nlaw, but that isn't all that general damages\nencompasses. General damages, as the Court recognized\nin Doe, are always presumed in the sense that they're\nalways assumed -- this is the common law definition of\ngeneral damages -- are always presumed in the sense\nthey're always assumed to have taken place and an award\nof general damages can be made even without specific\nproof of harm. But in cases where a -- at common law,\nin cases where a plaintiff did introduce evidence of the\nextent of, for example, the emotional distress that he\nhad suffered -- so, if he wanted to say I'm not happy\nwith the presumed damages that you would give to just\nanybody who had suffered this invasion of privacy, I\nhave a particularly sterling reputation or I am\nparticularly sensitive to this sort of thing, I suffered\na -- an increased amount of harm from what you might\npresume the average person would suffer, the award that\nthat person would receive is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why is that\ndifferent from actual injury? I have -- I'm not\nsleeping. I have a nervous stomach. I'm not eating.\nThe typical things that juries look at to determine\nwhether you've proven emotional distress --\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is that not actual\ninjury?\nMR. FEIGIN: So, the award that person would\nreceive for the additional proof of emotional distress\nwould be classified as general damages. Now, to get to\nyour question of why that's not actual damages.\nSometimes the terms \"actual damages\" or \"actual injury\"\ncan be used to include proven emotional distress, but\nthe term was ambiguous. We cite cases in footnotes 1\nand 2 of our reply brief in which the term \"actual\ndamages\" or \"actual damage\" is used to mean exclusively\npecuniary harm.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I've looked at those\ncases, and in all of them except for two, where the\nreference wasn't really precise, it was because the use\nof \"actual damages\" in the particular statute were\nlimited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at\nissue were pecuniary by nature.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, most of those\ncases are cases out of the common law, and sometimes\nthey use \"actual damages\" in the same sentence with a\nreference to emotional harm, making clear that they\nthink that the two types of harms are separate.\nBut, Your Honor, maybe I can try to explain\nit this way: I think actually Respondent implicitly\nagrees with our definition of general damages as\nincluding proven harm. If you look at footnote 2 on\npage 20 of the red brief and then again at page 22 of\nthe red brief, the definition of \"actual damages\" that\nRespondent is offering he divides into two\nsubcategories: special damages and general damages.\nEverybody agrees that special damages are limited to\npecuniary harm.\nAnd Respondent makes no claim, nor could he,\nthat the type of damages he's seeking are special\ndamages. So, to the extent he thinks that he's entitled\nto recovery under the Act, it's because he thinks that\nthe emotional distress harm that he wants to prove are\ngeneral damages. And if there's one thing we know about\nthe definition of \"actual damages\" in the Act, it's that\nit doesn't include general damages, because, again,\nCongress separately in the text of the Privacy Act\nassigned the Privacy Protection Study Commission to make\na recommendation about whether the Act should later be\nexpanded to include general damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What does \"actual\ndamages\" mean under the Fair Credit Reporting Act?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, we don't have a\nposition on that at this point. I can describe to you\nhow we think that the inquiry would work. We think that\nin some statutes actual damages might in context include\nemotional distress awards. But the term \"actual\ndamages\" by itself in a waiver of sovereign immunity is\nnot a clear and unambiguous waiver of the United States'\nsovereign immunity for claims of emotional distress.\nAnd as to statutes which do not allow claims\nagainst the United States, it would be a question of\ncontext and legislative history. And we'd have to do\nthe same kind of workup of the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nthat we've done of the Privacy Act in this case. One --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it can mean, and I\nthink it has been held to mean, damages to a dignitary\ninterest. Mental distress has been held to -- the term\nhas been held to mean that under the Fair Credit\nReporting Act.\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor. Multiple\ncourts of appeals have held that, and we're not\nquestioning that conclusion for purposes of this case\nwith the caveat that we don't think the United States is\nsubject to suit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nIf the United States were subject to suit\nunder the Fair Credit Reporting Act, then because\nthere's ambiguity about the meaning of \"actual damages,\"\nwe think that the narrower interpretation as limited to\npecuniary harm would control.\nOne other distinction between the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act and the Privacy Act is, again, as\nI've said, the Privacy Act specifically carves out\ngeneral damages as a type of damages that aren't going\nto be awarded, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act does\nnot.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act also has a\nmuch more permissive remedial scheme, allowing in\ncertain cases for statutory damages and also allowing\nfor punitive damages. I don't think the Fair Credit\nReporting Act, for the various reasons I've just\nmentioned, is a particularly good analogue for the\nPrivacy Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just to question what the\nterm means, what the term \"actual damages\" means.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, again, as\nwe've demonstrated in our briefs, I think -- again, I'd\nrefer the Court to footnotes 1 and 2 for how this term\nwas used at the common law -- the term \"actual damages\"\ncan mean both things.\nSo, the fact that in the Privacy Act it\ndoes include -- it may include emotional distress awards\ndoesn't mean that that's the sense in which Congress\nused it in the Privacy Act -- I'm sorry; I may have said\nthat wrong. The fact that in the context of the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act it may include emotional distress\ndoesn't mean that that's the way in which Congress used\nit in the Privacy Act. And I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there -- are there\ninstances where, if there's an invasion of privacy and\nthere's a documented trauma from psychosomatic illness\nwith medical expenses and lost wages, is that special --\nis that actual damage?\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor. If there are\ndocumented medical expenses that were out-of-pocket\nexpenses, then we think, even if they arise from\nemotional distress, then they would be pecuniary harm\nand could be compensated under the Privacy Act.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Are you\narguing that the emotional distress component can't be?\nMR. FEIGIN: The emotional distress\ncomponent itself cannot be, but medical expenses to\ntreat symptoms of emotional distress --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're -- under --\nas I understand the definition of \"special damages\" in\ncommon law, if you proved any pecuniary harm, you were\nalso entitled to the mental distress damages as well.\nSo, you want half of the common law award -- award?\nMR. FEIGIN: I don't think that's quite\ncorrect about the definition of \"special damages,\" Your\nHonor. And I don't think there is any dispute on this.\n\"Special damages,\" the term in this context, is always\nlimited to pecuniary harm. Once --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We may have a difference\nof -- of history there because, yes, special damages\nrequired pecuniary harm, but once you prove that, it\nalso permitted recovery of nonpecuniary losses as well.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, in a common\nlaw suit for defamation per quod --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's what your\nbrief said, actually.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, no, Your Honor. What we\nsaid in our brief is, in a common lawsuit for defamation\nper quod, there are two types of damages that could be\nrecovered: special damages and general damages. Unless\na -- special damages were limited to pecuniary harm.\nUnless a plaintiff could prove at least some special\ndamages, they wouldn't be entitled to any recovery at\nall. If a plaintiff could prove some special damages,\nthey could recover not only special damages -- in other\nwords, pecuniary harm -- but could also recover general\ndamages; that is, damages for emotional distress or\nother dignitary --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're not talking any\ndifferently. That's what I just said. If you --\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think to\nthe extent I was perhaps disagreeing with you is I was\nunderstanding you to say that the definition of \"special\ndamages,\" the term, sometimes includes emotional\ndistress awards. The term \"special damages\" is limited\nto pecuniary harm.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sort of odd for Congress\nto borrow from the defamation context and with a defined\nterm of art, \"special damages,\" and not use it in the\nPrivacy Act if that's what it intended.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And to use a term,\n\"actual damages,\" which has a much broader meaning than\n\"special damages.\"\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, as the Court\nrecognized in Doe, there's a structural similarity\nbetween the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act\nand the remedial scheme for defamation per quod at\ncommon law. And I think one reason there might be that\nstructural similarity is that defamation per quod at\ncommon law solves the problem that Congress faced when\nit was crafting the Privacy Act, which is trying to\nfigure out when a plaintiff's injuries are sufficiently\nserious and concrete as to justify an award of damages.\nI think it makes sense if, as the Court\nsupposed in Doe, Congress were aware of how defamation\nper quod had solved that problem, that Congress would\nhave adopted the same limitation -- in other words, a\nrequirement of showing of pecuniary harm -- as the\nthreshold requirement under the Privacy Act.\nNow, Congress had very good reason to be\ncautious about extending the scope of liability under\nthe Privacy Act. As I've said, the Privacy Act\nregulates a great deal of conduct that wouldn't have\nbeen compensable at all in common law, let alone\nresulted in any sort of emotional distress award.\nNow, Congress recognized, I think, some of\nthe concerns that Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor\nhave raised about why plaintiffs might in some instances\ndeserve recovery for emotional distress. But it\nrecognized that there are arguments on both sides -- on\nboth sides on that issue. And what it decided to do in\nthe Privacy Act was to defer that issue for later and\nassign the Privacy Protection Study Commission to make a\nrecommendation about whether the scope of liability that\nthe Act --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the Privacy\nStudy Commission coming after can't say what the statute\nmeans. I mean, that would be post-legislative history.\nI mean, the statute exists, and then we have a Study\nCommission to see what amendments might be made. But\nthe Study Commission can't decide what the -- what the\nAct means.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, two points on that, Your\nHonor: First of all, the reference of the general\ndamages issue to the Privacy Protection Study Commission\nis in the text of the Act that Congress enacted in 1974.\nSo, the exclusion of general damages doesn't depend at\nall on anything the Privacy Protection Study Commission\nsaid.\nAs to the weight we think the Privacy\nProtection Study Commission report should receive, first\nof all we think it's very telling evidence that there is\nat the very least ambiguity about what the term \"actual\ndamages\" could mean. The Privacy Protection Study\nCommission interpreted the term \"actual damages\" in\nprecisely the same way that we do in our brief; that is,\nas special damages, as that term was understood in\ndefamation torts at common law, which the Privacy\nProtection Commission Study report makes very clear at\npage 530 is limited to pecuniary harm.\nI think, if for no other reason than that\nthat's a reasonable reading, I think the sort of\njudicial restraint that is embodied in the canon that\nrequires courts to construe waivers of sovereign\nimmunity narrowly requires this Court to adopt that\nnarrower reading, because it shows that the narrower\nreading is at the very least a reasonable one or, as the\nCourt said in Nordic Village, is a plausible one.\nI think it would have been very unusual for\nCongress silently or ambiguously to have decided to open\nthe door to emotional distress awards under the Privacy\nAct. As I've said, the Privacy Act is quite a broad,\nsubstantive act that would have exposed the government\nto damages in -- in very new ways. And I think this\ncase illustrates -- illustrates that.\nThe district court here concluded that the\nlaw enforcement-related disclosure of Respondent's\nmedical information by the Social Security\nAdministration was, in fact, authorized under the\nPrivacy Act by routine use published in the Federal\nRegister. But it concluded that Respondent could\nnevertheless bring suit against the Federal Government\nunder the Privacy Act because the forms he filled out in\nseeking Social Security disability benefits didn't\nadequately disclose to him that his information might be\nreleased to other government agencies for law\nenforcement purposes.\nI don't think there's any reason why\nCongress would necessarily think that an omission on a\ngovernment form should give rise to a claim for\nemotional distress damages. There certainly wouldn't\nhave been any analogue for it at common law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's just saying\nthat he didn't have a good claim for relief. But let's\ntake the worst case, where -- where a government\nofficial spreads all kinds of false information or even\ntrue but terribly embarrassing information about a\nperson, does it deliberately. Let's take that case,\nbecause your rule covers all of them.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, in that case, Your Honor,\nthe plaintiff might have a claim under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act based on a violation of some State law\nstatutory or common law privacy protection. So, the\ncategory of cases that would have constituted invasion\nof privacy prior to the Privacy Act might still be\navailable to a plaintiff, who might then recover\nemotional distress damages against the government.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't that the very\nthing that Congress -- why did they pass this in the\nfirst place? I mean, Congress was thinking of emotional\ndistress injuries.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, they passed it, Your\nHonor, because they wanted, in the wake of Watergate, to\nimpose a set of detailed substantive requirements about\nFederal recordkeeping. I think the -- you know, looking\nthrough the Act, which takes up maybe 30 pages of the\npetition appendix, it clearly isn't simply a\ncodification of common law invasion of privacy against\nthe Federal Government.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's --\nMR. FEIGIN: It does much, much more than\nthat.\nYour Honor, even if we look just at the\ndisclosure-related provision, it's broader than common\nlaw invasion of privacy in two very important ways. So,\nfor common law invasion of privacy, a plaintiff would\nhave to prove disclosure of very personal and private\ninformation to the public at large. Under the Privacy\nAct, however, a disclosure even to a single person would\nconstitute a violation of the Act, and the information\ndoesn't even have to be private.\nLet me give a concrete example. So, if the\ngovernment has a record that contains information that\nsomeone has a criminal conviction, it might be a\nviolation of the Privacy Act for the contents of that\nrecord to be disclosed, even though someone could obtain\nthe same information by going to the court records or\npotentially looking them up on the Internet.\nAnd particularly since violations of Federal\nlaw are typically -- typically, the only type of relief\na plaintiff can seek for violation of Federal law is\nequitable relief under the Administrative Procedure Act.\nI don't think there's any reason to assume that Congress\nambiguously or, I think, really silently decided that it\nwas going to ratchet things up to a serious degree and\nexpose the United States to uncapped emotional distress\ndamages under the Privacy Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It did set a pretty high\nbar for the plaintiff to meet, because the plaintiff\nwould have to prove intentional or willful conduct, not\nnegligence, but --\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, three points on that,\nYour Honor.\nFirst of all, I think if Congress had\nthought that the limitation to intentional or willful\nconduct was itself a sufficient limitation on the\nliability of the United States, it wouldn't have been so\nreluctant to provide for general damages or perhaps even\nfor punitive damages.\nSecond, the courts of appeals now generally\ninterpret the intentional or willful requirement to\nrequire only something slightly less than recklessness\nor slightly more than gross negligence, which in\npractice provides district courts and courts of appeals\nwith a great deal of flexibility to find intentional or\nwillful violations in cases where the Federal Government\ndoesn't believe it should be liable.\nThird, to the extent the intentional or\nwillful requirement does impose a limitation on a\nplaintiff's recovery, what actually winds up happening\nin practice is that plaintiffs or courts will look to\nall the various technical provisions of the Privacy Act\nto try to find some violation that can be classified as\nintentional or willful. So, for example, if a plaintiff\nabout whom information has been disclosed can't show the\ndisclosure is intentional or willful, he may try to\nprove that a violation of the -- of (e)(10), which\nrequires the government to safeguard information, was\nintentional or willful.\nWith the Court's permission, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Cardozo.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND A. CARDOZO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CARDOZO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEmbracing the Government's view of \"actual\ndamages\" would mean that the very individuals Congress\nsought to protect in this Act would have no remedy at\nall for the primary form of harm that was well\nrecognized at common law when this Act was passed.\nTo carry out the Act's protective purposes,\nthis Court need only give the words \"actual damages\"\ntheir common and ordinary meaning that appears in\nBlack's Law Dictionary: proven, not presumed,\nliquidated, punitive, or other forms of damages that are\nnot tied to proof of harm.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this\nquestion about the damages that your client is seeking\nin this case? If -- if we affirm the Ninth Circuit,\nwould -- are you claiming all of the damages that -- all\nof the emotional damages that resulted from his criminal\nconviction, or are you claiming only the emotional\ndamages that would have been suffered by anybody else\nwhose records were turned over to the FAA under the\nOperation Safe Pilot program?\nMR. CARDOZO: If you affirm, there will be a\nproximate causation question that arises on remand. The\nAct requires the damages to be the result of the\nviolation. So, he cannot recover for the emotional\ndistress that followed from the prosecution.\nBut, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we're\ntalking today not just about Mr. Cooper; we're talking\nabout every single person to whom this Act applies: the\nwhistleblower who the government chooses to silence by\nembarrassing and humiliating them --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you allege that Mr.\nCooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was\nconfronted with the fact that his records had been\nturned over. So, you're -- you're saying that the\ncourt -- that on remand, there would have to be a\nseparation of the degree of distress that he suffered as\na result of simply knowing that somebody in the FAA had\naccess to his Social Security records, but disregard the\ndistress that somebody in that situation would naturally\nfeel when confronted with the fact that a criminal\nviolation that he had committed had been exposed?\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes. And that's the kind of\nthing judges routinely have to sort through. For\nexample, someone suffers emotional distress and then\nthey lose their job thereafter, and the injury that\nproduces the emotional distress, the job -- the job loss\nwasn't the proximate cause.\nJudges -- in fact, we ask juries to do that.\nIn this case, it would be a judge sifting through that\nand making that determination. As happened in\nPetitioner Doe's case, the judge could find that the\nemotional distress claim wasn't sufficient and reject it\naltogether, but that's the nature of an emotional\ndistress remedy.\nOne thing you didn't hear in that argument\nalmost at all was any discussion of the text of this\nAct, which tells you in at least four separate ways that\n\"actual damages\" simply means proven, not presumed,\ndamages.\nBeginning with the words themselves, that's,\nof course, the most common meaning of \"actual damages,\"\nthe one that appears in Black's Law Dictionary. As\nJustice Sotomayor pointed out, the term of art for\neconomic loss in this arena is \"special damages.\" If\nthat's what Congress meant, presumably it would have\nused that term. It's the more common way to express one\ncategory of damages only. That's economic --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you agree that the Act\ndoes not allow recovery for what would have been\nregarded at common law as general damages?\nMR. CARDOZO: What would have been regarded\nat common law as presumed -- the presumed damages, this\nAct doesn't allow. That was peeled off for further\nstudy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: \"General damages\" -- that's\nthe term that they peeled off, right?\nMR. CARDOZO: Right. But by keeping\n\"actual,\" the juxtaposition between actual and\ngeneral --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But general damages is a\nterm from -- from the remedies in defamation cases,\nright?\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And there are two types of\ndamages in defamation cases, special damages and general\ndamages? And if you -- is that correct?\nMR. CARDOZO: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, you subtract general\ndamages, and what do you have left?\nMR. CARDOZO: But the interesting thing in\nthis case is they didn't take what you have left,\nspecial damages, and they used a different term,\nCongress did, \"actual,\" a term that suggests we're going\nto require proof of the damages. We're not going to\npresume them. We're not going to allow speculative\ndamages.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the problem is that --\nthat your definition of actual damages and the general\ndefinition of actual damages includes some things that\nfell within the rubric of general damages.\nMR. CARDOZO: That's true. But several\nother things in the text of the Act tell you, again,\nthat \"actual\" means simply proven, not presumed. If you\nlook at the section 2, where Congress recites findings\nand the statement of purposes for the Act, the right\nthat's being described here is an individual and\npersonal right of privacy, well understood, well settled\nat the time to be a right that was primarily\nnonpecuniary in nature.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me just try this\none more time. You -- you say that there's a right to\nrecover actual damages but no right to recover general\ndamages. So, what you think is recoverable is actual\ndamages minus general damages?\nMR. CARDOZO: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMR. CARDOZO: Our position is what is\nrecoverable is actual damages, the damages you prove,\nsubstantiate. A judge can reject it if they find it\nunsubstantiated as happened in Petitioner Doe's case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but we --\nMR. CARDOZO: But you can't presume --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Courts don't -- courts\ndon't allow recovery for conjectural or speculative\ndamages. That's just -- that's just -- or am I wrong?\nDo Federal courts --\nMR. CARDOZO: No, but in this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- routinely tell juries,\nnow you can come in with conjectural or speculative\ndamages? That's not the way juries are instructed.\nMR. CARDOZO: But you can in this arena at\ncommon law presume damages from the nature of the\nviolation. That is what was carved out, the ability to\npresume it, rather than present evidence and subject it\nto proof.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you tell me what your\nresponse is to the Government's argument that the\nPrivacy Commission which was set up understood the word\n\"actual damages\" at the time the way they understand it?\nWhat's your response to that? I -- are they right about\nthat in your opinion?\nMR. CARDOZO: Apart from the obvious that\nthe post-enactment report was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm asking you what --\nMR. CARDOZO: But -- but -- yes, on the\nunderlying point, several things. The commission --\nthis is a -- two paragraphs in a 620-page report that\ndoesn't run through the text of the Act, it's purpose,\nall of the things one normally does in statutory\nconstruction. So, where they draw this conclusion is\nentirely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. CARDOZO: -- opaque.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, am I right in saying\nyour -- you would agree with them that that is how the\nPrivacy Commission understood the Act, but in your\nopinion, the Privacy Commission was wrong?\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes, with one other -- with\none other proviso I would add. There's a little bit of\nambiguity. You see the Privacy Commission in this two\npages was trying to sell Congress on the notion of\nexpanding the remedy. So, it wrote on pages 530 of its\nreports: \"If the rights and interests established in\nthe Privacy Act are worthy of protection, then recovery\nfor intangible injuries such as pain and suffering, loss\nof reputation, or the chilling effect on constitutional\nrights is a part of that protection. There is evidence\nfor this proposition in common law privacy cases.\"\nSurely, Congress knew that very thing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And by \"pain and\nsuffering,\" they mean mental pain and suffering?\nMR. CARDOZO: Right. Surely, Congress knew\nthat same thing. So, when it enacted this Act, it did\nnot mean to cut out the primary form of harm.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. CARDOZO: Another --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what the Government\nwould say is -- is that -- and they have their own\ndictionary definitions. I don't -- I don't think it's\naccurate to say that Black's Law Dictionary defines\n\"actual damages\" the way you would have it defined. As\nI recall, their briefing gives some other definitions\nfrom an earlier version of Black's or whatever.\nBut what they say about the commission\nunderstanding, which you acknowledge to be contrary to\nyour understanding of actual damages, what they say is\nthat at least shows that it isn't clear what \"actual\ndamages\" means. And -- and in their estimation, once\nyou -- once you establish that it isn't clear, then you\ntrigger the -- the rule that waivers of sovereign\nimmunity will not be considered to have any scope except\nthat scope which is clear.\nMR. CARDOZO: Well, that's why it's critical\nto understand the analysis, because you can't say\nthere's a genuine ambiguity unless you understand how\nthey arrived at that conclusion. The meaning of \"actual\ndamages\" can vary with the context, but it's usually\ncrystal clear in each context what you're talking about.\nIn this privacy context, it's fairly clear.\nWe have a provision at page 66a of the appendix, section\n2(b), where Congress recites of purpose of this remedies\nprovision, and it states the purpose is to hold the\nUnited States liable \"for any damages which occur as a\nresult of.\"\nThe notable thing about that statement of\npurpose, \"which occur as a result of,\" lines up\nprecisely with proven, not presumed, damages. But \"any\ndamages which occur as a result of\" conflicts directly\nwith the notion of only one category of damages as being\nauthorized. That's Congress's statement of purpose for\nthis very provision. That aligns. Mr. Cooper's\nconstruction aligns. The Government creates disharmony\nin the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This would save me some\ntime possibly, but my guess is, and you may know, that\nevery State or many States have statutes or tort laws or\nsomething against invasion of privacy. Now, you may\nknow how many. And -- and if you know how many, that's\nhelpful. And of those, if you know how many, how many\nof them, and perhaps all, provide damages for mental\nsuffering caused by a violation of that particular\ntort-like provision?\nDo you know anything about those statistics?\nMR. CARDOZO: Justice Breyer, you've given\nme a little bit too much credit. I can't give you a\nnumber of States, but I can tell you that I'm not aware\nof any State that disallows. It is by far the general\nrule, and I think it's universal, that recovery of\nmental and emotional distress for invasion of the\nprivacy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you know enough to know\nif they've done so through the use of a term like\n\"actual damages,\" that one or analogous thereto, or\nwhether they've had to have some special form of words?\nMR. CARDOZO: I don't know that. So,\nI'll --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you're talking\nabout statutes that require that the material have been\nmade public, not that, say, establish a violation if one\nagency provides the information to another agency? I\nmean, as the Government points out, this -- this statute\ngoes far beyond any -- any State statutory or common law\nprotections of privacy. It's really very picky, picky.\nAnd -- and to say that, you know, whatever\nemotional harm comes from that is -- is quite different\nfrom saying that under State privacy laws emotional\ndistress is compensable.\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes, but we're all here today\nonly talking about the narrow category of cases in which\nthere's an intentional and willful violation. So, they\nknew the law prevented them from doing what they did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right. But\nall you have to know is that you shouldn't give it to\nthe other agency, because you're not making it public.\nYou're not doing the kind of thing that constitutes an\ninvasion of privacy under State law. You've just\nfailed, intentionally failed, to follow the very\ndetailed and, as I say, picky, picky prescriptions\ncontained in the Privacy Act.\nTo say that you get emotional distress for\nthat as opposed to genuine -- what I would call genuine\nprivacy incursions, which State law covers, is a\ndifferent question.\nMR. CARDOZO: But -- but this provision is\ncovering the range of intentional and willful violations\ncovered in the Act. The example of the whistleblower\nwho you want to silence, so you leak the most\nembarrassing details to the press, shaming and\nhumiliating them in front of friends and family -- don't\nleave the house for a month, but you haven't lost your\njob, and you're not out of pocket -- zero remedy, zero.\nThat's the Government's construction.\nAnd look at section 2, how Congress\ndescribed this Act. They didn't say we're imposing some\npicayune technical requirements. They're saying we're\ndoing this to safeguard individual rights of privacy.\nThey use the very lingo; they analogized it unmistakably\nand explicitly to the common law kind of invasion of\nprivacy for which emotional distress is routinely\nrecoverable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any\nstatistics on the percentage of actions brought under\nthe Privacy Act in which the plaintiff was able to\nestablish pecuniary harm?\nMR. CARDOZO: I don't have any statistics on\nthat. The one thing I can tell you is that this has\nbeen the law in the Fifth Circuit for well over\n30 years, and as the Government -- and prior to Doe v.\nChao, the rule was, in most circuits, you didn't have to\nshow any damages. And yet, at that point, a good\n37 years after the Act had come into existence, the\nGovernment stood up here and admitted that far broader\nconstruction of the Act than we are talking about today\nhad no meaningful effect on the public --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that in the Fifth\nCircuit or the Ninth Circuit for -- for many years?\nMR. CARDOZO: This case is in -- coming out\nof the Ninth Circuit, but the Fifth Circuit has the\nrule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has had this for a long\ntime. Okay.\nMR. CARDOZO: In the early '80s, it first\nrecognized emotional distress.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you aware of any\nrunaway verdicts based on awards of mental damage proof?\nMR. CARDOZO: The only case that I'm aware\nof --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I define \"runaway\nawards\" as those in -- in six figures or above.\nMR. CARDOZO: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or even high five\nfigures.\nMR. CARDOZO: The highest that I can think\nof at the moment was a case out of the Fifth Circuit\ncalled Jacobs in which a Federal agency revealed --\nleaked to the press information falsely suggesting a\nbank president was a money launderer. He got 100,000 in\nemotional distress, but that's a pretty extreme\nsituation. The vast majority, it's going to be modest.\nAnd I would say he should get $100,000 in emotional\ndistress. He's an upstanding member of the community\nand he's being called a common criminal; he might not\nhave suffered any pecuniary loss, but he has suffered\nactual damages.\nOne other thing about the text that tells\nyou -- again, all of these points -- points align with\nMr. Cooper's construction and produce disharmony to the\nother side. Look at the breadth of the language\nCongress used to waive sovereign immunity in subsection\n(g) of the Act. Recall that the Government's\nconstruction is only one small category of plaintiffs,\nwho are the victims of intentional and willful\nviolations, can recover. Yet, the text says in any suit\nin which a court determines that there's been\nintentional and willful violation, the United States\nshall be liable for actual damages.\nIf what we mean is only one small category,\neconomic damages, is serving as a substantial reduction\nin the category of cases that can be brought, you'd\nexpect to see that limitation appear after the\n\"intentional and willful\" in any suit in which a court\ndetermines there has been willful, intentional violation\nand the plaintiff has suffered economic loss, because it\nis a substantially narrowing term.\nHowever, if \"actual damages\" simply means\nproven, not presumed, this wording is perfectly natural\nand flows exactly. Again, every place you look in the\ntext of the Act, proven, not presumed, aligns.\n\"Economic only\" is a square peg in a round hole in the\ntext of this Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in your argument, do\nyou have to avoid the concession that the term might be\nambiguous? I know your position is that liability for\ndamages is expressly waived, but then you stop there,\nand you -- and you say that -- you resist the idea that\nthe definition of actual damages has to be unambiguous.\nIs that a fair characterization of your argument?\nMR. CARDOZO: I would modify it slightly.\nWhat the Government is talking about is an ambiguity in\nthe abstract. They're lifting the two words out of the\ncontext of the Act. Like any phrase, \"actual damages\"\ncan mean different things in different contexts. But in\nthis statute, when you run through the tools of\nconstruction, it's not ambiguous. And that's --\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a different\npoint. And the question went to whether you acknowledge\nthe need to be unambiguous. Now, what the Government\nsays is, of course, the -- the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity, you would acknowledge, must be unambiguous,\nbut the Government says further, moreover, the scope of\nthe waiver of -- of sovereign immunity must be\nunambiguous. Whether you have waived it only with\nrespect to pecuniary damages or also with respect to\nemotional harm, that also must be unambiguous. And --\nand you deny that second step, don't you? You think --\nMR. CARDOZO: Actually we don't, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't?\nMR. CARDOZO: And this is how I would\nclarify it. What the doctrine of sovereign immunity\nrequires is that the waiver be expressed in text, and\nthe court can't read it in. It can't add words to the\ntext. If you -- if your intent is to separate out\npresumed liquidated, punitive, other forms of damages\nthat do not -- are not tethered to proof of harm,\n\"actual damages\" is a phrase that does that precisely\nbecause that's what \"actual\" means; it means real.\nThere's no ordinary definition of \"actual\"\nwhere it means pecuniary only, that is -- you get when\nyou use it in certain contexts. So, this Court doesn't\nneed to add, expand, or read anything into these words,\n\"actual damages.\" It simply needs to give them the\nmeaning that they have in ordinary English definitions,\nin Black's Law definition. This definition this Court\ngave to actual damages in the Birdsall case over a\nhundred years ago is the same thing: presumed -- proven\ndamages, not presumed. So, the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity is here expressed; it doesn't arise by\nimplication.\nBut the one -- but there's another side to\nthe sovereign immunity point that the Government never\nmentions. The court's obligation is dual here. When\nthere has been a waiver, the court can't expand that\nwaiver, but neither can it contract it. You have here\nthe Government spinning out theoretical -- theoretical\npossibilities that actual damages was -- was used in\nthis more peculiar sense; what it really meant was\nspecial damages -- to produce a deconstruction of the\nstatute that eviscerates it, leaves most of the people\nwho suffer intentional, willful violations without any\nremedy at all. And those who happen to have an economic\nloss do not get compensation for the primary form of\nharm from a privacy violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The argument you've\nmade, and I certainly understand it, that this is the\nPrivacy Act, and so it's precisely these types of\ndamages that you'd be concerned about, really cuts both\nways. I mean, what you're saying is this is a really\nbig chunk of damages, because this is what the whole Act\nwas about. And it seems to me that that argument\nsuggests that there's some weight to the Government's\npoint that, well, if you're going to get into that, you\nreally do need a clear waiver of sovereign immunity.\nMR. CARDOZO: Absolutely, but -- but that\ncircles back to my point that if you're going to -- if\nyour intent is to say presumed, not proven, \"actual\"\nfits exactly. \"Special\" is the term that wasn't used\nhere. So, to fault Congress for picking a term that\nmeans precisely \"proven, not presumed,\" and say you\nweren't clear enough, that's asking too much,\nparticularly when they also said -- in their statement\nof purpose, they spoke to the remedies provision and\nsaid \"any damages which occur as a result of.\" They\nused the sweepingly broad language. They did multiple\nthings to say -- reveal no doubt about its intent.\nAnd recall the rule from the Morissette and\nMolzof case when Congress is legislating against a\ncommon law background. The rule is if Congress's\nsilence is taken as an indication that Congress intends\nto follow established norms, not depart from them, when\nCongress says \"actual damages\" in a privacy context,\nit's fair to -- it's going to assume that people are\ngoing to understand that at common law, actual damages\nincluded emotional distress for privacy violations.\nSo, rather than assuming that it departed\nfrom the common law, we typically require a contrary\ndirection, under Morissette and Molzof, and you don't\nhave that contrary direction here.\nAnd you get the same answer as you roll\nthrough -- you don't need to look -- go past the text,\nbut you get the same answer as you roll through all of\nthe tools of construction: The common law background\nand the Morisette/Molzof rule points you to the same\nplace. The legislative history. This Act, the Act that\nemerged, was a compromise between a far broader remedial\nscheme that authorized punitive damages, did not have\nthe intentional and willful requirement, had a\nnegligence standard, and a more measured version.\nThe Government's construction of this Act\nthrows that compromise out the window and rewrites the\nAct as a one-sided in the Government's favor when what\nclearly happened in the legislature was a balance was\nstruck.\nAnother thing about the legislative history,\nboth the House and Senate bills originally had the term\n\"actual damages\" in there from the start, and they both\nhad \"actual damages\" simply as a counterpart to punitive\ndamages. Again, another confirmation. Actual damages.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose this were a\ncommon lawsuit for -- for slander per quod, and what was\nsaid was that Mr. Cooper received Social Security\ndisability benefits. Now, he would -- and he claims\nthat causes him great distress because of the extrinsic\nfact that he was known to be a pilot, and, therefore,\npeople who -- who knew that he was flying around an\nairplane even though he was so severely disabled that he\nwas entitled to get Social Security disability\nbenefits -- that would damage his reputation.\nNow, the damages that you're seeking, the\nemotional distress that he allegedly incurred, what\nwould that be? Which -- under what category of damages\nwould that fall?\nMR. CARDOZO: His -- his economic loss would\nbe special damages.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And let's --\nMR. CARDOZO: The damages he could prove --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't claim any economic\nloss here.\nMR. CARDOZO: Right. The damages he could\nprove would be actual damages.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. That -- under the --\nwould that be the term that a court -- a common law\ncourt would use, actual damages? Wouldn't they ask\nwhether the damages to his reputation and the emotional\ndistress that he suffered therefrom were either --\nwouldn't they ask whether that was special or general?\nMR. CARDOZO: Well, they could also use\nactual damages because, of course, in the Gertz case,\nthe Court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. Gertz came after the\ncommon law. Gertz was a modification of the common law.\nWhat would it be at common law?\nMR. CARDOZO: At common law, it would be\ngeneral damages, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: General damages here are\nexcluded by Congress, right?\nMR. CARDOZO: They were referred for further\nstudy, but what was authorized in the text, the\nsubstantive provision, is actual damages, not special\ndamages.\nIf Congress had wanted to peel off the whole\npiece and require only economic loss, the more common\nand routine term of art that's used is \"special\ndamages,\" which circles back to another important point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but -- but elsewhere\nin the statute, it's made very clear that Congress did\nnot think it was authorizing general damages, right?\nBecause it set up this commission to recommend whether\ngeneral damages should be included. Now, what would be\n-- what would be the purpose of that commission if\nindeed actual damages already included general damages?\nMR. CARDOZO: It doesn't include general\ndamages. Recall the presumed damages. The presumed\ndamages. A substantial portion of the compensation\nordinarily available would be peeled off under our\nconstruction. And this was a distinction that actually\nappeared in the Gertz case, where to place First\nAmendment limitations on recovery. The Court\ndistinguished between actual damages and presumed\ndamages. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that actual\nemotional damages are not -- are not general damages?\nMR. CARDOZO: I wouldn't say -- I would say\nyou could call them general damages. In the context of\nthis Act, what Congress does not choose special damages\nas the term of what it's authorizing and, instead,\nchooses the broader term, \"actual damages.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it -- it does use\nthe term \"general damages\" and makes very clear that it\ndoesn't think this statute covers general damages. So,\nI think -- I think you have to argue that the term\n\"general damages\" includes only \"presumed\" emotional\nharm and not \"proven\" emotional harm.\nMR. CARDOZO: That -- that is exactly our\nposition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. CARDOZO: And the thing I would add to\nthat is general damages -- actual damages was in the\nstatute long before general damages surfaced. It\nappeared at the eleventh hour, and Congress just said\nlet's send that off to the commission. That's important\nto keep in mind, because it creates a huge question\nabout what Congress meant to peel off. There's no\nexplanation of general damages. It isn't defined. It\narose at the eleventh hour.\nBut the important thing is the term it kept\nin the statute was not \"special damages,\" the term of\nart that has a pecuniary limitation. It kept the\nbroader term \"actual damages,\" and the term it kept\naligns with its statement of purpose, the breadth of the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, and the nonpecuniary\nexpression -- a desire to protect nonpecuniary interests\nthat's throughout the Act.\nLet me wrap up with a couple of observations\nhere. Congress passed this Act to restore the citizens'\nfaith in their government, and it made a solemn promise\nto the American citizens that in cases of intentional\nand willful violation, the United States shall be liable\nfor actual damages.\nToday, the Government is proposing that\n\"actual damages\" be read in a way that renders this Act\nvirtually irrelevant. That makes a mockery of that\nsolemn promise. To preserve the vitality of this Act,\nthis Court need only give \"actual damages\" its most\ncommon and ordinary meaning: proven, not presumed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feigin, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI just have a few points. First of all,\nRespondent would like the Court look -- would like the\nCourt to look to, quote, \"the common and ordinary\nmeaning\" of actual damages, and asserts that the term\n\"actual damages\" fits exactly here. But no court to\nconsider this issue has ever thought that the meaning of\n\"actual damages\" was plain. You have to look at the\ncontext.\nAnd the context here includes the exclusion\nof general damages, which I think Respondent conceded,\nwhen Justice Alito asked him this question, includes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you seem to be\narguing throughout that \"general damages\" meant actual\ndamages when \"general damages,\" in my understanding,\nmeant two things: presumed and actual. So, why is it\nillogical for Congress to look at what \"general damages\"\nmeant and pick the meaning that included proven damages,\nactual?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think if\nyou look at the sources cited in our brief, as well as\nthe sources cited in his brief -- in particular, I'd\nrefer you to the block quote on page 22 -- \"general\ndamages,\" that term, most typically refers to a class or\na type of damages that could be presumed but could also\nbe proven.\nAnd when they are proven -- and I think\nRespondent effectively conceded this -- they remain\ngeneral damages. And because Congress decided to think\nabout general damages later, because that would have\nbeen such a great expansion of the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity, I don't think the Act should be construed to\nallow those type of emotional distress damages.\nNow, Respondent would like to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm still confused.\n\"General damages\" meant presumed or actual? Congress\nsays we don't want general damages because it includes\npresumed. So, we're going to use the word \"actual.\"\nHow do you get from that, that Congress meant \"only\npecuniary\"? I mean, that has its -- why didn't they\njust use that? Instead of \"actual damages,\" why didn't\nthey just say \"pecuniary damages,\" if that's what they\nintended?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat's essentially Respondent's argument. He wants to\nfault Congress for not using the specific term \"special\ndamages.\" But I think that flips the canon of\ninterpreting waivers of sovereign immunity on its head\nand requires Congress to unambiguously not waive its\nsovereign immunity when, in fact, what I think the Court\ndoes is precisely the opposite.\nI also think, Justice Breyer, addressing the\nPrivacy Protection Study Commission, the commission\nincluded two of the Congressmen who sponsored the\nPrivacy Act. It agreed with our reading, the reading\nthat we're offering here, of what both \"actual damages\"\nmean and what \"general damages\" mean. And -- and not\nonly did they agree with that, but there's a statement\nin the legislative history that adopts our definition,\ntoo, that's discussed in our brief.\nNow, I think what Respondent essentially\nwants the Court to do here is to adopt the\nrecommendation of the Privacy Protection Study\nCommission that the Act be expanded to allow both\nspecial and general damages, in which case emotional\ndistress awards would be allowed. Now, there may be\nsome good policy arguments for that, as the Privacy\nProtection Study Commission said, but the judicial\nrestraint that's embodied in the sovereign immunity\ncanon I think compels the Court not to get out ahead of\nCongress on this issue.\nCongress didn't provide emotional distress\nawards when it passed the Act in 1974. It never amended\nthe Act to include them. And the Act does not provide\nfor them. Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: At -- wait -- at common\nlaw, if you have a minute.\nSuppose a plaintiff proved that this\nparticular violation of privacy was so terrible he was\nin bed for a week, he couldn't go to his family's\nwedding. I mean, the absolute -- the clearest possible\nproof. Now, would that have been considered general\ndamages or not? So, it wasn't presumed. It wasn't\nspeculative. It wasn't anything. It's absolute -- tied\nup. Definite.\nWould that have been considered general\ndamages, or -- or would it have been considered special?\nMR. FEIGIN: Emotional distress, even\nphysical symptoms of emotional distress, are general\ndamages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter how well proved.\nNo matter how clearly proved.\nMR. FEIGIN: No matter how they're proved,\ndid you say?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter how clearly they\nare proved.\nMR. FEIGIN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThey're general damages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and I can look -- to\nverify that, I look at what definition where?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nyou can look at page 139 of the Dobbs treatise, which is\ncited in our brief, which very clearly defines general\ndamages in that fashion. Also, if you look at the\nSecond Restatement, section 621 and 623, they define\ngeneral -- they define general damages and emotional\ndistress damages in this context only by reference to\nproven damages.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
