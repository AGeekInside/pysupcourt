        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst in United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court has made clear in its\njurisprudence concerning the Sixth Amendment right to\nthe assistance of counsel that the core purpose of that\nright is to secure a fair trial conducted in accordance\nwith adversary procedures.\nAs a result of the Court's analysis of that\npurpose, this Court has required in its Sixth Amendment\nassistance of counsel cases either a showing that\nprejudice be demonstrated in a particular case to show\nthat a fair trial has not been guaranteed or that there\nis a basis for presuming prejudice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When did -- when did we\nfirst hold that the State had to provide counsel if --\nif the defendant could not afford his own counsel?\nMR. DREEBEN: I believe that Gideon was\ndecided in 1963, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what we generally\nmean nowadays by the right -- by -- by the right to\ncounsel. And when you talk about fairness being its\nobjective, you're talking about the objective of that\nnewly discovered right to have counsel appointed.\nBut I don't know that fairness was the -- was\nthe object of the original right to counsel in the --\nin the Bill of Rights, which -- which only applied to\n-- to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you\ncouldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one. I hardly\nthink that -- that fairness is the object of that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, in fact,\nthis Court has recognized that under the Sixth\nAmendment, as applied to the Federal Government, even\nbefore the Sixth Amendment was made applicable to the\nStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, that it did\nguarantee the right to appointed counsel if the\ndefendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when was our first\nholding to that effect?\nMR. DREEBEN: Johnson v. Zerbst, I believe,\nwas in the '30s.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the '30s. Gee, that's\n--\nMR. DREEBEN: The -- the fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's hardly -- that's\nhardly the original purpose and meaning of the Sixth\nAmendment, and -- and you come here and say that its\nfundamental purpose is something that is only the\npurpose of the newly evolved Sixth Amendment and not of\nthe original one.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, our position on\nwhat the purpose of the Assistance of Counsel Clause is\n-- is drawn from what this Court has said that purpose\nis in the way that it's elaborated it. And I think\nthat if the Court looks at the spectrum of contexts in\nwhich the Court has applied the Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel, it's apparent that the most fundamental\naspect of the guarantee and the one that is most\nindispensable to protecting the fairness of a trial,\nwhich is the overarching goal of the Sixth Amendment,\nis that the defendant have counsel by his side at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's the\noverarching goal of the original. I think it's -- it's\nvery fundamental, that if you have funds with which you\ncan hire someone to speak for you, you should be able\nto use all of your -- I mean, your -- no. Your -- your\nfreedom is at stake. You should be able to use all of\nyour money to get the best spokesman for you as\npossible. That's the element of fairness that I think\nis there.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think that this\nCourt has made clear that the core element of fairness\nis protecting the defendant's ability to have a lawyer\nthere at all, and if the lawyer is not there, the\nessential fairness of the trial is in jeopardy. And\nit's for that reason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But until the 1930s that\nelement didn't exist.\nMR. DREEBEN: There were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Until the 1930s, if you\ndidn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's not entirely true,\nJustice Scalia, because there certainly were many\njurisdictions, even at the time of the founding, that\nprovided for the appointment of counsel if the\ndefendant was not able to retain his own counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me. As far as\nthe Constitution is concerned, if you didn't have the\nmoney, you didn't have counsel.\nMR. DREEBEN: What this Court has done I\nthink, in the course of the 20th century jurisprudence\nthat has examined the right to counsel, is establish a\nhierarchy of the critical rights that are necessary for\na fair trial. The first, of course, is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what if --\njust to take an example, let's suppose there are two\npossible defenses you could raise, entrapment and that\nyou didn't do it. And one lawyer wants to argue\nentrapment and the other wants to, you know -- the one\nthat you want is the one who said we'll argue you\ndidn't do it. Don't you have a right to have a lawyer\npresent the defense along the lines you want presented\nas opposed to having to take another lawyer that is\ndifferent than your choice?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, within limits, I think\nthat that's certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice. But, of\ncourse, this case and many of the cases that raise this\nissue do not involve a situation in which the defendant\nis deprived of retained counsel with whom he can\nconsult and whose strategic decisions he can control\nthrough his role as the client.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that was my -- even\nin the Chief Justice's hypothetical, I -- I take it the\nclient has a right to direct the attorney what defense\nto present, or am I wrong about it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think within limits, that's\nabsolutely right, Justice Kennedy. And the right of\ncounsel of choice, as this Court has articulated it in\nits Wheat decision, is far from an absolute right.\nIt's a qualified right that does yield to interests\nthat are designed to protect the fairness of the trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in this -- in this\ncase, Mr. Dreeben, we have a defendant ready, willing,\nand able to pay for an experienced lawyer in whom he\nhas great trust. He's instead stuck with a younger,\nrather inexperienced lawyer, and he says, that doesn't\nfit within my Sixth Amendment right. I have a right to\nchoose the counsel that I want and not the one that the\ncourt forces on me.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think\nit's critical in this case that it -- the court never\nforced a lawyer on Respondent in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was a junior\ncounsel. As I understand it, the counsel that\nrepresented him finally, when the judge wrongfully\nrefused to allow his chosen counsel to proceed, was one\nchosen as a junior by the more senior counsel, the one\nthat defendant wanted.\nMR. DREEBEN: And the Respondent had months\nafter that disqualification was made clear and the\ncourt of appeals denied mandamus to retain a different\ncounsel if he chose to retain a different counsel.\nThere's no showing in this record that the Respondent\ndidn't consult with the lawyer who was disqualified and\nwith the lawyer who he elected to have represent him at\ntrial and not determine that that was in his best\ninterest at that time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he was just disabled from\n-- from his first choice.\nMR. DREEBEN: He was disabled --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The court told him you can't\nhave the counsel you want. Go find somebody else.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right, and that's why we\nare not disagreeing in this case that there's been an\ninfringement of his constitutionally protected interest\nin having counsel of choice.\nBut the question for this Court is how should\nthat be defined as a denial of a Sixth Amendment right.\nShould it be something that is automatically\nreversible so that even if Respondent had --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do you reconcile your\nposition with the right to self-representation, if\nsomebody doesn't want a lawyer at all? And I guess if\nthe judge insists on him taking a lawyer, that could be\nreversible error.\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court has made clear that\nthe right to self-representation is unique.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is even a greater right\nthan the right to pick your own lawyer.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is a much greater right\nbecause it protects autonomy interests that are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why doesn't the choice of\ncounsel protect autonomy too?\nMR. DREEBEN: It protects it, but in a much\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You have a lawyer. After\n30 years, you trust him completely. You want him to\nrepresent you. Isn't that a -- an element of autonomy?\nMR. DREEBEN: There's a modest element of\nautonomy in the right of counsel of choice, but the\nright of self-representation is complete autonomy.\nThere is no substitute for the individual defendant's\nvoice in the courtroom. There is no representative\nthat could give him that right.\nAnd this Court has also recognized that the\nright to self-representation is usually a right that\nredounds negatively for the defendant. It tends to\nproduce worse trial outcomes for the defendant. And in\nrecognition of the autonomy as independent of fair\ntrial interests that are protected by the right of\nself-representation, this Court has placed it in that\nvery small group of rights in which automatic reversal\nis appropriate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would the Government's\nposition be if the disappointed client whose choice of\ncounsel was rejected by the court applied for mandate\nreview in the court of appeals?\nMR. DREEBEN: Our position is that if there\nwere a clear abuse of discretion, in accordance with\nthe ordinary mandamus standards --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we don't know -- we\ndon't know if that's the case. He -- he wants to go\nimmediately to the court of appeals. What would the\nGovernment's position be?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Government's position is\nthat he could seek a writ of mandamus, and if he\nqualified under the standards for mandamus, then he\ncould obtain relief. This Court has already held in\nthe Flanagan decision that there's no automatic right\nof interlocutory review from the denial of counsel of\nchoice, and the Court did that in recognition of the\nfact that either the right could be vindicated at the\nend of the trial or it's not totally separable from the\nmerits.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Government always\nacquiesces in the propriety of seeking mandate from the\ncourt of appeals?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think it's really up to\nthe Government. The defendant can seek mandamus, and\nif the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, I suppose the\nGovernment can object that it's improper or that it's\nunnecessary or a waste of time. I'm asking what the\nGovernment's position is.\nMR. DREEBEN: The Government's position is\nthat it would depend on whether the defendant could\nsatisfy the high standards required for mandamus. And\ncertainly if the Government believed that the\ndisqualification was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if the question\nis fairness, as you -- as you propose, then it would\nseem to me that there would be no need for the\nextraordinary proceeding.\nMR. DREEBEN: The Government doesn't dispute\nthat as in this -- as this Court held in Wheat, there's\na presumption in favor of counsel of choice. Every\ncourt has rules that govern how lawyers are to enter\ntheir appearances and represent defendants, and\ndistrict courts can make --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say that\npresumption is sufficient so that mandate should be\nentertained by a court of appeals anytime this question\ncomes up?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not anytime, Justice Kennedy.\nI think that would effectively overturn this Court's\nholding in Flanagan, that there's no right of taking a\ncollateral order appeal in every single case involving\nthe disqualification of counsel.\nBut what's critical here, I think, is to\ncompare the position of a defendant who has no counsel\nat all, the position of a defendant who has counsel\nwho's laboring under a conflict of interest, the\nposition of a defendant who has a counsel who's not\nperforming competently, who's making professionally\nunreasonable decisions. Only in the first of those\ninstances has this Court held that automatic reversal\nwithout any showing of prejudice at all is warranted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did Flanagan, the case that\ndenied mandamus on this issue -- did it assume any\nresolution of the question whether if -- if you can't\nhave counsel of your choice, in order to get your\nconviction reversed, you have to show -- you have to\nshow that the error was not harmless?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, Flanagan held\nthat there was no collateral order appeal. It didn't\naddress the mandamus question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand, but --\nMR. DREEBEN: In rejecting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but I would certainly\nthink that it's relevant to the question of whether you\nallow immediate appeal, what the consequences of not\nallowing immediate appeal are. If you're totally\ndeprived of your right, you -- you might allow it and\n--\nMR. DREEBEN: What this Court said in\nFlanagan is that if the defendant, at the end of the\nday -- and if was the operative word -- could obtain\nautomatic reversal, then the defendant's interests\ncould be vindicated at the end of trial. And if,\nalternatively, the defendant had to establish\nprejudice, then the interlocutory appeal would fail the\nrequirement that the issue be totally separate from the\nmerits, and therefore, there was no collateral order\nappeal.\nAnd Flanagan didn't address this issue, but\nin addressing it, I suggest that this Court should look\nat the way that it has protected other criminal\ndefendants' rights under the Sixth Amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, did I\nunderstand your brief to suggest that the -- I\nunderstand your main burden is to overturn the idea of\nautomatic reversal.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if there were a\nstandard, is your standard of prejudice the same as\nunder Strickland, or is it a different standard?\nMR. DREEBEN: Our -- our standard of\nprejudice, our preferred standard of prejudice, is the\nsame as under Strickland. We would not require the\ndefendant to show that his second-choice retained\ncounsel performed incompetently. Second-choice\nretained counsel can perform fully competently and have\nmade a significantly different strategic course of\naction than the counsel who actually went to trial, and\nthat could easily be established by having an affidavit\nor testimony submitted. It's actually easier than\nconducting a Strickland inquiry because in Strickland,\nyou're looking at the way counsel performed and your\nhypothesizing how a competent counsel would perform.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would it be easier\nthan in Strickland? In the -- in the case of\nineffective assistance of counsel, you have a very\nfocused inquiry, but in this situation, how are you\ngoing to -- how can a judge assess, after the fact,\nwhether the strategy that was pursued was inferior to\nanother strategy that's -- that -- that allegedly would\nhave been pursued if the first-choice attorney had been\nselected? Or maybe even more difficult, how can a\njudge assess whether the attorney who ended up\nrepresenting the defendant was in some way less\nskillful than the attorney that the -- the defendant\npreferred to have? That seems like a very difficult\ndetermination to make.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Alito, I don't think\nthat it is that difficult. I think, in fact, it's\neasier than Strickland because in Strickland, you have\nto look at one lawyer and decide whether his\nperformance was not competent and then hypothesize what\na competent lawyer would have done, and then conduct\nthe counter-factual inquiry of how it would have\naffected the trial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but isn't it almost\nessential, in one of these inquiries, to -- to invade\nthe attorney-client privilege over and over again to\nfind out what they might have done with a different\nlawyer?\nMR. DREEBEN: This almost invariably occurs\nin every Strickland case. And my fundamental\nsubmission here is that a defendant who is saddled with\na lawyer who performs in an unprofessionally\nincompetent manner cannot overturn his conviction\nwithout --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't want -- I\ndon't want a competent lawyer. I want a lawyer who's\ngoing to get me off.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I want a lawyer who will\ninvent the Twinkie defense. I would -- I would not --\nI would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention\nof a competent lawyer. But -- but I want a lawyer\nwho's going to win for me. And -- and there's no way\nto predict what lawyer has a charming way with the jury\nor -- or brings in some -- some side matters that maybe\nshouldn't be brought in but the judge is silly enough\nto let them in. I want to win. And -- and the\ncriterion for winning is not how competent is the\nlawyer necessarily.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but I think that -- that\nYour Honor's question reveals that different lawyers\nwill make different strategic judgments and assessing\nthe impact of those on the trial --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in -- in hindsight,\nyou've always made a mistake if your client is found\nguilty.\nI -- I'm just not sure how this inquiry would\nproceed. It seems to me that there ought to be either\nautomatic reversal on one -- on one hand, or the other\nrule ought to be incompetency of counsel. But you're\n-- you're going to have satellite litigation with\nspeculation, and it seems -- it seems to me not a good\nremedy.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the -- the remedy that --\nthat this Court has chosen when counsel is not\ncompetent requires I think a -- a systematic inquiry.\nI wouldn't call it entirely speculative. It's a\nfocused inquiry into what the impact would have been\nhad counsel performed differently.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only issue in that case\nis competent performance, and it seems to me that the\n-- the difficulty behind a number of our questions this\nmorning is that you are trying to draw an analogy from\n-- from counsel issues that don't involve an autonomy\ninterest to a counsel issue that does involve an\nautonomy interest, maybe in theory not as greatly as\nself-representation, but as -- as everybody agrees, as\nyou've said, it involves some autonomy interest. And\nif we're going to import the rule of prejudice from\nnon-autonomy cases as the -- as the necessary condition\nin autonomy cases, then it seems to me the autonomy\ninterest is devalued to the point of almost of\ndisappearance. It becomes not much more than -- a\nlittle bit, but not much more than an ineffective\nassistance case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it becomes\nconsiderably more than an ineffective assistance case.\nAnd the autonomy interest that's being protected here\nneeds to be viewed in relation to the fact that the\ndefendant can still retain his counsel. It's not that\nhe's denied all choice of counsel. He's denied his\nfirst-choice counsel which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you say he's -- he's\nnot denied all choice. He is denied the choice that he\nwants to make.\nMR. DREEBEN: He may very well be denied that\nchoice, Justice Souter, if he tries to retain that\nlawyer and that lawyer has a conflict of interest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's not the State's\nproblem. We're talking about the State standing in the\nway of it. In this case the State through the court\nsystem stood in the way of it because it made an error\nthat denied him his right.\nBut the -- the -- it seems to me the autonomy\ninterest is not merely an interest in choosing second-\nbest. It's an interest in choosing the one you want.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it isn't necessarily\nsecond-best. And the irony of Respondent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's second-best to the guy\nwho wants somebody else.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, if -- if he retains\nsomebody else and that person obtains a complete\nacquittal, that -- that individual is, no doubt, going\nto be very satisfied. And the historical example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what good is that as --\nas an answer to our question? Sure, no harm, no foul.\nBut that can't be the -- that can't be the criterion\nfor a court and that can't be our criterion in deciding\nwhether he really has a right to his first choice or\nnot.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I think what it\nillustrates is that the right to choose counsel is\nconnected with the desirability, as Justice Scalia\npointed out, of a favorable outcome. And it is not\ncomplete --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's -- it's basically -- in\n-- in Justice Scalia's question, it is connected with\nwhat the -- the client believes will be a favorable\noutcome by using the lawyer he wants. It's his\njudgment about what will probably be a favorable\noutcome, and his judgment about the lawyer who is most\nlikely to bring that about.\nMR. DREEBEN: There's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, all -- all I'm\ngetting it, is that's a different -- that is a very\ndifferent criterion from what we apply in Strickland.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, and I'm not suggesting\nthat the Court apply the criteria in Strickland. And\nthis Court has a variety of other standards that it could\nchoose if it concluded that the Eighth Circuit's rule\nof automatic reversal provides an unjustified windfall\nfor a defendant when it's considered that defendants\nwho -- this would basically be equating the right of\ncounsel of choice, which is available only to about 10\npercent of our defendants in the criminal justice\nsystem, because the other 90 percent don't have the\nfunds. Therefore, they're not hiring anyone.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why take it away from\nthe 10 percent?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not suggesting that it be\ntaken away. I think that it needs to be protected.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- because you're\nsaying they don't have it.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm saying that they have it,\nbut in order for this Court to conclude that reversal\nof a trial that can be presumed fundamentally fair,\nbecause the defendant, in fact, went to trial with\ncounsel who he had chosen, albeit as his second choice,\nshould not occur with all of the societal impacts that\nthat has, the potential for victims to have to go\nthrough a retrial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a fair trial. Nobody\nis saying it wasn't a fair trial, but he didn't have\nthe lawyer he wanted. I mean, we could assure\neverybody a fair trial by allowing nobody to pick their\nlawyers and assigning lawyers to everybody. That would\n-- that would accomplish fair trials throughout the\nUnited States, but that's not the system we have.\nYou're -- you're entitled to the lawyer that you want.\nMR. DREEBEN: And -- and we're not disputing\nthat that entitlement exists. The question is whether\nit should be remedied automatically, which puts it in a\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Dreeben, I think\nyou're underestimating the importance of the autonomy\ninterest because going through a criminal trial for a\ndefendant is a very traumatic experience, not just what\nhappens in the courtroom, but during the entire\nprocess. He has a lawyer of his own choice who's going\nto advise him on what he should do and how he should\nreact to possible changes in his own condition and\neverything else. The -- the autonomy interest is\npowerful in that situation.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the autonomy interest\nis deserving of protection, as this Court has held, but\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Totally independently of\nthe trial strategy --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I -- I don't agree that\nit's -- that it really has a function in the Sixth\nAmendment that's independent of what the Sixth\nAmendment itself says, which is the assistance of\ncounsel for his defense. And this Court has made clear\nthat in the context in which it's looked at and\ninvolving conflicted counsel, involving ineffective\ncounsel, involving total denial of counsel, involving\nappointment of counsel or even the retention of counsel\nin a situation where no lawyer could be expected to\nperform in a competent manner and protect the\ndefendant's rights, that all of those rights and\ninterests are tied to the basic purpose of the\nAssistance of Counsel Clause. It is not a expressive\nclause in the middle of the Constitution. It is not a\nmini First Amendment. It is a right that is tied to\nthe purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee in helping\nassure fair trial outcomes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the right of\nassistance of counsel for his defense. Right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not for the fuller\nexpression of his autonomy.\nMR. DREEBEN: That is correct. And that is\nwhy this Court, in construing this right, in the\ncontext of what I think is probably the most critical\naspect of the right, once you have a lawyer in the\ncriminal justice system, namely the right to the\neffective assistance of counsel, the Court has looked\nto the impact on the fairness of the trial.\nNow, this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I, Mr. Dreeben --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you could say\nthe -- you could say the same thing, counsel, about his\nright to self-representation, that he has the right to\nself-representation for his defense or for his --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, you could not say that,\nJustice Scalia. This Court did not infer the right of\nself-representation from the Assistance of Counsel\nClause. It inferred it from the network of rights that\nare provided in the Sixth Amendment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it is limited to\nthe right of self-representation for his defense, just\nas his choice of counsel is limited to his choice of\ncounsel for his defense.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that's accurate,\nJustice Scalia, because what the Court made clear in\nits self-representation cases is that there was an\nimportant historical tradition that was being\nprotected, and it's being protected independent of the\ndefendant's interest in a successful outcome. It's\nallowing the defendant to speak to the jury in his own\nvoice because there's something deemed fundamentally\nunfair about a system in which a defendant needs to go\nto prison without ever having been able to speak in his\nown voice to a courtroom.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is there a less worthy\nhistorical tradition to be honored in a defendant's\nchoice of his own counsel?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't deny that there's a\nhistorical tradition, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but you --\nMR. DREEBEN: But it's a very qualified one.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you concede that if --\nif it's a historical tradition to speak in one's own\nvoice, it gets -- for practical purposes, it gets a\nkind of absolute respect. Whereas, if it's a\nhistorical tradition to choose one's own counsel, it\ndoes not get that -- I mean, it's very -- that seems to\nme a -- a kind of historical dissonance.\nMR. DREEBEN: There -- the point that the\nCourt relied on in concluding that automatic reversal\nwas appropriate for denial of the right to self-\nrepresentation included the critical fact that this is\nnot a right that proceeds in connection with the\nfairness of the trial. Its -- its sole existence is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, and the question is\nhe -- I mean, the -- the whole point here isn't the --\nisn't the interest in autonomy a separate interest\nwhich should be recognized by some means other than\nmerely looking to the fairness of the trial.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that it is a right that\nshould be -- an interest that should be recognized, and\nit is, of course, recognized in Wheat by saying that\nit's comprehended within the Sixth Amendment. There is\na qualified interest that a defendant has in retaining\ncounsel of choice. But should it be elevated to be\nequated with the total denial of counsel?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But compared to what? You\nhaven't fully stated what you would replace the\nautomatic new trial with. And you said -- you started\nto say something about if the defendant could show that\nhis preferred counsel would have pursued a different\nstrategy. Is that it? Or would he have to go beyond\nthat and show that that different strategy would have a\ngreater chance of success than the strategy that was in\nfact pursued?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I think the\nCourt has before it three options for some standard\nthat would not consist of an automatic reversal\nstandard.\nThe first, and the Government's preferred\nposition, is that the defendant should come in and show\nwhat counsel of first choice would have done as a\nmatter of strategy and show that if he had pursued\nthat, it would create a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome, the same test as in Strickland.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does different outcome\nmean --\nMR. DREEBEN: More favorable --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if the defendant is\nfound guilty, he would have been acquitted?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. The same -- same\ntest as in Strickland. It doesn't require proof that\nmore likely than not the defendant would have been\nacquitted, but it undermines confidence in the outcome.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you think that would\nwork with the Twinkie defense?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Scalia, you'd\nhave to actually look at the specific facts of the case\nand make a determination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think any court\nwould conceivably reverse the -- the disqualification\nof counsel on the ground that he would have come up\nwith that defense and win.\nMR. DREEBEN: And if that's because any court\nwould conclude that that defense was not likely to\nprevail, then I would submit that the proper\naccommodation of the societal interest in respecting a\nfinal judgment and protecting the interest -- the\nqualified interest in counsel of choice is properly\nresolved.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said you had -- you\nsaid you had -- your first preference would be --\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- different strategy and\nwould have been acquitted with that strategy. What's\nyour other --\nMR. DREEBEN: The second option would be the\nstandard that the Seventh Circuit selected in Rodriguez\nv. Chandler, which requires a showing that the second-\nchoice lawyer was deficient in some important\nqualification or would -- pursued a different strategic\ninterest and a different strategic approach than first-\nchoice counsel, and that's it. More analogous to this\nCourt's conflicts jurisprudence where, when there is\nsimultaneous multiple representation, it's sufficient\nfor the defendant to show a different strategic\napproach that was not taken because the conflict caused\nthe -- the lawyer not to do that, and there's no\nrequirement of outcome determinativeness that goes\nalong with that.\nAnd the third alternative would simply be to\nprovide a harmless error standard, instead of deeming\nthis to be structural error, equating it with a biased\njudge, total denial of counsel, racial discrimination\nin the grand jury. This Court could provide a standard\nin which it's the Government's burden to show that the\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, which in\ncases of overwhelming evidence, the Government could\nestablish.\nAnd although, I acknowledge, Justice Souter,\nthat the autonomy interest would be, to a certain\nextent, lost in that instance, there are many rights,\nmany interests that are sacrificed and not deemed\nremediable when the error is found harmless.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the sacrifice sort\nof egregious here? Because in the case of self-\nrepresentation, we give virtually absolute respect to\nit, knowing perfectly well that the decision to\nrepresent one's self is usually crazy. Whereas, in\nthis case, when the decision may very well be sound, we\ngive -- we would, on your view, give a -- a much\nreduced respect to it. That does not seem consistent.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I -- I do want\nto reserve the remainder of my time, but the point is\nthat a defendant who has his second-choice opportunity\nof counsel is able to express his autonomy interests in\na much more significant way than a defendant who is\ndenied the right to self-representation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'd like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAt the moment a trial court impermissibly\ndisqualifies a defendant's retained counsel of choice,\nit violates the Sixth Amendment. It is not necessary\nto wait and see what happens at any trial that follows,\nand indeed, in our view --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not just\ndisqualify. Suppose he denies a motion for\ncontinuance. The counsel is in another trial and he\nsaid, I can't be here for another 10 days. And the\ncourt says, I -- I deny that. I -- I assume if it's an\nabuse of discretion, the result would be the same under\nyour view.\nMR. FISHER: Well, this Court already has a\nbody of jurisprudence, beginning with Powell against\nAlabama, that decides when a judge acts within his\ndiscretion in denying a continuance, for example, to\nallow the defendant to get the retained counsel of his\nchoice. We'll -- we'll leave that jurisprudence where\nwe found it when we showed up today because here, it's\nundisputed in the record, and the -- and the United\nStates does not dispute in this Court, that the denial\nwas impermissible --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you may leave the\njurisprudence where you found it, but other attorneys\nmight not. And I'm -- I'm concerned with the\nconsequences of your rule. There are many reasons, it\nseems to me, why a counsel may not be able to represent\nthe -- the client that has chosen him as -- as the\nfirst choice.\nMR. FISHER: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if -- if you prevail\nhere, it seems to me that counsel can come in and say,\nnow, Judge, I've looked at your calendar, and you can\ncertainly wait for another 2 weeks, and the judge has\nto do it.\nMR. FISHER: We don't -- we don't believe\nthat's the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't know why he\nwouldn't.\nMR. FISHER: We don't think that's the case,\nJustice Kennedy. In this Court's jurisprudence, you've\nalready recognized that trial judges have substantial\ndiscretion, both in terms of calendaring and efficiency\nconcerns, and in the Wheat case, for things like\nconflicts in interest to regulate when the defendant is\nable to proceed with the defendant -- I'm sorry -- with\nthe lawyer he's chosen.\nAs I said, we're not asking to change the\nstatus quo in any respect here because here it's\nundisputed that the trial judge had no legitimate\nreason to deny the defendant --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would require --\nif -- if a defendant is on his second choice and he's\nfiled an affidavit saying, you know, the guy did a\ngreat job. I can't think of a way he would have done\nanything differently. I was convicted. I'm perfectly\nhappy with his strategy, but I didn't get my first\nchoice. You would still require reversal of the\nconviction in that case.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it seems -- you know,\nperhaps we could imagine a scenario, Mr. Chief Justice,\nwhere the defendant effectively waives his right, and\nif he came out and said so much to the court. But\ncertainly it is our position that if he's denied the\nfirst-choice counsel against his wishes and without any\nlegitimate justification, a Sixth Amendment violation\noccurs right then and there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and if -- if\nhe were not able to afford a -- afford an attorney and\none were appointed for him and that lawyer were\nincompetent, that client would still have to show\nprejudice. But in your case, you don't have to show\nanything at all.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. And that goes to\nthe heart of the kind of right that we're talking about\ntoday, and this is the critical difference between the\ncounsel of choice right and the Strickland right. And\nthe difference is in -- in the counsel of choice right,\nthe Government has affirmatively acted to interfere\nwith the way the defendant wants to conduct his defense\nand has every right to conduct his defense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does a -- someone\nrelying on appointed counsel have the same right? Why\ncan't he say to the first person who comes through the\ndoor, you know, I've got a -- I'd like to see the\nothers before I make a choice?\nMR. FISHER: No, he doesn't, Your Honor. The\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not?\nMR. FISHER: -- the defendant who has counsel\nof his -- who's -- who's appointed counsel does have a\nlimited right to control certain fundamental decisions\nin his defense such as whether he testifies, whether he\naccepts a plea offer. So there is even some autonomy\nthat resides in the defendant who has appointed\ncounsel.\nBut the critical distinction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think he can also\nreject an appointed counsel. Can't he go to the court\nand say, I -- you know, I don't like this counsel?\nMR. FISHER: Certainly that happens, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I know it happens.\nMR. FISHER: You know, there are -- there are\ncertain instances where a defendant may be so -- have\nso little basis for doing so or may be -- you know, may\nbe asking too much of the court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that\nwould happen if there's an autonomous, structural right\nof the kind you -- you urge.\nMR. FISHER: The -- the autonomy interest in\nthis case is the defendant's right to control his\ndefense. It's the defendant's right, as this Court put\nit in Faretta and later in McKaskle, to control the way\nhis case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So I want to control the\ncase by having a different appointed counsel.\nMR. FISHER: Well, this Court -- I mean, in\nnumerous areas of this Court's jurisprudence, not just\nin criminal procedure, this Court recognizes that there\n-- people have certain rights, but if they have the\nmeans to effectuate those rights, they're in a better\nposition than people that don't. Take the First\nAmendment. The First Amendment protects people with\nprinting presses, but the Government doesn't have to go\naround giving other people printing presses in order to\n-- to say what they want to say.\nSo what we're talking about here is the 10\npercent, or whatever number we want to ascribe to it,\nof defendants who have the -- the ability and the means\nto hire retained counsel. And at the moment a trial\ncourt tells them, for no legitimate reason, you cannot\ngo forward with this person, that's what we submit\nconstitutes a Sixth Amendment violation. And in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many lawyers --\nyou're talking about a very refined assertion of a\nconstitutional right. I mean there are hundreds and\nhundreds of thousands of lawyers, and what you're\nsaying is that if he doesn't get choice one, choice two\nis just not going to do, no matter how close, no matter\nhow similar their approaches are going to be. It's not\nlike he's, you know, wants a Rolls Royce and he gets a\n-- you know, whatever -- a Yugo or something. He could\nchoose, you know, the next best out of hundreds and\nhundreds of thousands.\nMR. FISHER: In some cases, that's true, Mr.\nChief Justice, although I would hasten to -- to tell\nyou that even in the context of defendants who can\nretain counsel, very often, if their retained counsel\nis disqualified, they're forced, as in this case --\nthey're simply out of money and have to go forward with\nlocal counsel. So as practical terms, I'm not quite\nsure that's right.\nBut, yes, we are talking about a small\nuniverse of people, but it's an important universe of\npeople. It's people that come into court and they say\nthis is how I want to conduct my defense. In McKaskle,\ntalking about the self-representation right, this Court\nsaid that oftentimes the messenger is as important as\nthe message in -- in a criminal defendant's case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, can there not be a case\nwhere it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the --\nthe judge's mistaken ruling on a disqualification\nmotion didn't have any effect on the outcome?\nMR. FISHER: I think only in the case of an\nacquittal. And -- and there -- and there, of course,\nwe don't have an appeal. But, Justice Alito, I think\nthis goes back --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why not?\nMR. FISHER: -- to the Twinkie --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why not in the\ncase of an acquittal? There's still a violation of the\nSixth Amendment. Maybe you don't have an appeal, but\nyou have a 1983 action. Right? Because your\nconstitutional rights have been violated because,\nalthough you won, you didn't win with the counsel of\nyour choice. And if -- your personal autonomy\ninterests have been quashed.\nMR. FISHER: I think you'd have a\nconstitutional violation, but it would, in fact, be\nharmless, and I don't think you'd have a 1983 action\nbecause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't be\nharmless under your theory because your theory is that\nthis is giving expression to your personal autonomy.\nIt's not simply for your defense. If it were harmless,\nit would say that it's totally wrapped up in the\ndefense. But there's another constitutional interest\nunder your theory.\nMR. FISHER: Okay. Well, I -- I think what\nI'll say is then we have an immunity problem with\nbringing the 1983 case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say the defendant\nwanted to be represented by a relative whose -- whose\nspecialty is real estate, and for some reason, that\nlawyer is wrongfully disqualified. And so then the\ndefendant ends up with a very experienced criminal\npractitioner with a national representation -- a\nnational reputation, and still the defendant is\nconvicted. Could that not be harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt?\nMR. FISHER: Let me say two things to that,\nJustice Alito. The first is that's akin to the\nhypotheticals in the United States' brief. We've --\nwe're not aware of that situation ever having occurred.\nBut if it did, yes, you would have a violation.\nAnd it's important to separate the right from\nthe remedy here. We would unquestionably have a Sixth\nAmendment violation when the trial court, for no\nlegitimate reason, said, you cannot go forward with the\ncounsel of choice. Now, the only question I think\nyou're framing is whether we'd have a Chapman case there.\nBut this just brings up, Justice Scalia's Twinkie\ncase, and to take away --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or my Uncle Vinnie.\nWhat about the real -- the real case of my Uncle\nVinnie? There's --\nMR. FISHER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know -- I don't know\nwhether he was a real estate lawyer or not.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'll try to do even better\nthan Uncle Vinnie, and say in our brief we talk about a\ncase, the Euel Lee case, which is a case where a black\ndefendant wanted to go forward with his counsel of\nchoice in -- in the District of Maryland, and he was\nforced to go ahead with a more experienced,\nestablishment-type counsel and -- and to his detriment.\nSo -- so we proceed at our peril where we say that the\ndefendant doesn't have the right to decide what's best\nfor him.\nThe core right, which this Court recognized\nin Wheat -- we would submit to the Court that this\nCourt saying in Wheat there's a presumption that the\ndefendants have the right to proceed with counsel of\nchoice really can't be explained in any other way than\nsaying that the right -- the Sixth Amendment right here\ngoes beyond simply a fair trial and does encompass an\nautonomy interest. And to conceptualize that autonomy\ninterest within the Sixth Amendment the way that Wheat\ndoes is simply to say that the right to counsel of\nchoice is like any number of other Sixth Amendment\nrights, which is to say, trial judges have the power to\ncurtail it or qualify it when they have legitimate\nreasons for things like the integrity of the courts,\nfor things like the efficiency of the docket, Justice\nKennedy, and lots of other things.\nThe same is true of self-representation. A\ndefendant does not have an unqualified right to self-\nrepresentation. A defendant can be forced to have\nstandby counsel. The defendant can even have his right\nto self-representation taken away if he's too -- too\ndisruptive in the courtroom. So the same kinds of\nconcerns --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but this is\nall subject challenge as an abuse of discretion.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. And there is --\nthe United States raises in its brief the -- the\nsupposed danger that courts and prosecutors will be too\nhesitant to challenge selected counsel of choice, but\nyou've already taken that fully in consideration in\nyour Wheat decision. I mean, that's the basis for this\nWheat decision is to say these are decisions that have\nto be made at the outset of trial. And so, therefore,\nwe're going to give trial judges substantial latitude\nand broad discretion to decide when -- when the\ndefendant has to accept a different lawyer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I suppose\nthis -- this right applies on appeal as well. Right?\nSomebody says, I want Mr. Fisher to argue my case in\nthe Supreme Court. I don't want anybody else. And --\nand yet -- and we get motions for admission to our bar\npro hac vice. If we deny one of those, does that\nviolate the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. FISHER: Well, it's not contested in this\ncase that the -- that the pro hac vice denial did\nviolate the Sixth Amendment. So I'm not sure -- this\nisn't something you have to deal with in this case.\nBut, yes, this would be a right that would --\nthat would go forward on appeal, provided the defendant\nwalked into court and said this is the person who I\nwant to go forward with me, and the court, under its\nrules and practices and in the substantial discretion\nthat court has in Wheat, if the trial court simply went\n-- if the court simply went off the reservation and\nsaid, no, you can't have this person for no reason,\nthere would be.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that this\n-- trial is -- is one thing. Appeal -- but you say he\nwould do the appeal over? He'd do the appellate\nargument over? Do the petition for cert over with\ncounsel of choice? There's a different stage involved.\nMR. FISHER: It might, Justice Ginsburg. And\nto be frank with you, I haven't thought all the way\nthrough the consequences --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you entitled to\nrepresent yourself on appeal?\nMR. FISHER: No, you're not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So --\nMR. FISHER: So there is a difference, of\ncourse, this Court has recognized in its Martinez case,\nthat takes place.\nBut to bring the point home, in -- in Wheat,\nsimply saying that the defendant has the right to\ncounsel of choice unless the trial court has a good\nreason for saying no, would make this right just like\nlots of other rights in the Sixth Amendment, the right\nto self-representation, the right to cross-examination,\nall the other rights in the Sixth Amendment that can\ngive way for efficiency or integrity concerns.\nBut what the United States is suggesting is\nsomething radically different that we submit doesn't\nexist anywhere else in constitutional law, which is to\nsay that this Court recognizes that a certain right\nexists, but when it's arbitrarily denied, the defendant\nsimply has no remedy unless he can affirmatively show\nhis own prejudice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- that happens\nall the time. That happens, for example, in the case\nof incompetent counsel. There's a right to -- to\ncompetent counsel. If you -- if that right is\nviolated, the defendant still has to show prejudice --\nMR. FISHER: It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- before he'll get\nrelief.\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe critical difference between this and the\nright to effective assistance of counsel is the\naffirmative action by the court. And in Strickland\nitself at page 686, this Court recognized the Geders --\nthe Geders decision, the Brooks decision, the Herring\ndecision, which are all accepted by the Solicitor\nGeneral in footnote 3 of its brief. And the core\nholding of those cases is when the court interferes\nwith what the defendant wants to do, then a Sixth\nAmendment violation takes place right then and there,\nand we don't look at all to whether prejudice took\nplace.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you relying\nat all on the effect that you want the Court's decision\nto have on trial judges and prosecutors, that is, a\njudge who knows if he disqualifies a lawyer who\nshouldn't be disqualified, that there will be an\nautomatic new trial? And the prosecutor who's standing\nby -- by the way, what did the prosecutor -- did the\nprosecutor take the position in this case when the\njudge says, I don't want that lawyer to be in my\ncourtroom?\nMR. FISHER: Let me answer it both on the\nfacts and on the law. On the facts of this case, there\nwas a pretrial sanction hearing in which the prosecutor\nshowed up unannounced to the defense and actually\nsubmitted witnesses and evidence to support the\ndisqualification of Mr. Low. So, yes, the prosecutor\ndid play a part and support the disqualification in\nthis case.\nNow, to answer your question on the law and\nthe practicalities, we're here today defending the\nstatus quo because the rule in every Federal circuit is\nthat on direct appeal if the right to counsel of choice\nis denied, it's an automatic reversal. So we're --\nwe're relying on the practicalities of how things work\nin the lower courts only to the extent to say it's\nworking fine just now, and this Court ought not to\nupset that. Right now, by our count, you get probably\nfewer than one case a year in the Federal courts of\nappeals where a scenario as rare as this arises. And\nso we think that this Court's incentives, which are put\nin place by the Wheat case, as I was talking about, get\nit just right. They get it so that, yes, there's a\nlittle bit of hesitance, but on the other hand, trial\njudges have substantial discretion in making these\nthreshold decisions. And so we submit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases in the\nrecords where it shows government overreaching or bad\nfaith and so forth in trying to get rid of the counsel?\nThat just doesn't happen?\nMR. FISHER: I'm not aware of any case,\nJustice Kennedy, where an express finding of bad faith\nis placed on the record. But -- but, of course, that\npoints out one of the -- one of the things about this\nkind of case is that we just have a record in many\nways.\nWhat the United States is suggesting is that\nwe should have these satellite collateral proceedings\nwhere we have to not just investigate questions like\nthat perhaps, but also recreate an entire trial. And\nthis is much more difficult than the Strickland\nscenario because, as Justice Alito pointed out, in\nStrickland we can at least compare the defendant -- the\ndefendant's lawyer's performance against an objective\n-- an objective counsel. And even -- and it's even\neasier than that because, because of the performance\nprong, the first prong of the Strickland test, we\nwinnow out the decisions that lawyer made to probably\njust two or three. I mean, in this Court's typical\nStrickland case, it looks at one or two decisions a\ntrial judge -- the trial counsel made.\nIn this context, we'd have to look not just\nat an entire trial, but at the entire attorney-client\nrelationship from the moment the -- the counsel would\nhave met the defendant, all of the different decisions\nthat might have taken place in terms of investigation,\nnegotiation, strategy before trial, strategy during\ntrial. And what you'd be asking is for this first-\nchoice counsel presumably to take the stand or file\nsome sort of affidavit not saying this is the strategy\nthat would have -- would have necessarily happened\nbecause he didn't get to try the case. What -- what\nyou'd be asking this person to do is sort of take the\nstand and hypothesize what he might have done in all\nthese various situations --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would your -- would your rule\n--\nMR. FISHER: -- with all the problems of\nhindsight.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would your rule apply in the\ncase of a guilty plea?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I mean, our rule would --\nwould apply in a guilty plea case, provided the\ndefendant didn't waive it, didn't waive the -- the\nargument in his guilty plea.\nBut the problem with -- you know, to look at\nthe other side, imagine the -- the case where the\ndefendant's first-choice counsel is disqualified and he\ndoes plead guilty and he wants to plead guilty, which,\nof course, happens in over 90 percent of the criminal\ncases in the country. There, we have an enormous\nproblem because how is that person supposed to show on\nappeal what would have happened with his first-choice\nlawyer?\nFirst of all, under the -- under the United\nStates conception, which conflates this -- this right\nwith Strickland, they have the problem of this Court's\ndecision in Hill against Lockhart which holds that a\ndefendant doesn't have an ineffective assistance type\nclaim unless he can show that he wouldn't have pleaded\nguilty at all but for his counsel's advice.\nAnd secondly, we have the problem, once\nagain, of just the crazy kind of predictions that we\nhave start to engage in. We -- I suppose there in a\nguilty plea case, we have to put the -- the first-\nchoice lawyer on the stand to testify to all the\nvarious things he might have done. Then perhaps we\nhave to put the prosecutor on the stand to say, oh,\nwould you have taken the deal if this would have taken\nplace and that would have taken place and the other\nwould have taken place.\nAnd -- and what we submit is that not only is\n-- is this fundamentally improper because once we have\na constitutional violation, the only -- the only\nchoices on appeal are Chapman error and structural\nerror, and all of this is outside the record. So it\nwould be impossible to do under Chapman.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, remind me in\nbringing up the plea question. I thought one of the\nreasons why this defendant wanted this particular\nlawyer is that this lawyer made good bargains with the\nprosecutor. Was that not so?\nMR. FISHER: That is part of the record,\nJustice Ginsburg. The lawyer that the defendant wanted\nin this case had appeared in the very same court\nseveral months before before the very same judge and\nstepped in on the eve of trial and negotiated an\nextremely favorable plea agreement for the defendant in\nthat case. And that's how Mr. Gonzalez-Lopez learned\nabout Mr. Low and that's why he sought him out. I\ndon't think it's a part of the record whether he wanted\nto plead guilty or whether he wanted to go to trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some of the --\nMR. FISHER: But that's certainly one of his\nconsiderations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some of the concerns\nabout the evidentiary presentation were addressed by\nthe Seventh Circuit and are the reason they adopted a --\na lesser standard than the prejudice standard in -- in\nStrickland. Why isn't that adequate to meet those\nconcerns?\nMR. FISHER: Well, for two reasons, Mr. Chief\nJustice. First of all, the Seventh Circuit, with due\nrespect, simply misconceived the right. It's our\nfundamental submission here that the right is violated\nat the moment the trial judge impermissibly\ndisqualifies the counsel, and that's what the Seventh\nCircuit didn't understand. Once you say that that\nviolates the right, then your only choices, under this\nCourt's jurisprudence -- what it said in Neder was the\nonly two choices are structural error or a Chapman\nreview.\nThe Seventh Circuit, of course, was deciding\na habeas case. It had an evidentiary -- it had the\nability to compile an evidentiary record, but once you\nrecognize that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of\nchoice is violated at the moment of the\ndisqualification, then your only choices are Strickland\n-- I'm sorry -- are Chapman or structural error.\nThe Seventh Circuit way of doing things,\nwhich the United States to some degree embraces, of\nhaving an evidentiary hearing on collateral review\nproves the point why we can't say this is subject to\nharmless error review because we don't have the stuff\nin the record that we need. And that's what the\nSeventh Circuit didn't -- didn't -- first of all, it\nwasn't speaking to it because, of course, it was\ndeciding a habeas case. But it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What are the -- what are\nthe practicalities or impracticalities, as the case may\nbe, of seeking immediate review from the court of\nappeals by writ of mandate?\nMR. FISHER: Oh, well, there's -- there's two\nbig problems with what the -- with the United States'\nposition on that point, Justice Kennedy. The first is,\nI -- I think as -- as came out, if mandamus became too\ncommon, it would effectively overrule this Court's\nFlanagan decision.\nBut there's an even more fundamental problem,\nwhich is to say that mandamus is only available when a\ndefendant can show a clear violation of a right. Now,\nthe way the United States conceives the right, there's\nno violation of the right until you haven't received a\nfair trial. So imagine the defendant going up pretrial\non mandamus and saying, my right to counsel of choice\nhas been violated. The appellate court's response\nwould be, well, we can't decide that. We don't even\nknow whether it's been violated until we see the record\nthat develops in this case and the defense that your --\nthat your replacement counsel puts on.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it would be easy\nfor us to make a distinction between the right and the\nremedy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm not sure you're\nproperly characterizing the -- the Government's\nposition. I mean, you -- you don't have to assert that\nthe right is not violated until -- until there's an\nunfair trial in order to take the position that the\nGovernment takes. I mean, the right -- a lot of rights\nthat are later reviewed for harmless error or for -- to\nsee whether there was prejudice were violated at the\ntime, and not -- not just on the basis of whether there\nwas prejudice or not.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Scalia, I think I'm\nfairly characterizing the Government's position when I\nsay that as a constitutional matter, they say there's\nno Sixth Amendment violation until we see what happens\nat the trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they said there\nisn't if the question is remedied.\nMR. FISHER: I don't think that's the way\nthat they're presenting their case, Justice Ginsburg,\nand this is important because what the Government is\nsaying is the right itself is not violated until we\nhave a breakdown in the adversarial process at trial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in all events, we\ncould structure the decision to make -- to make sense,\nand if these instances happen, as you indicate in your\nbrief, very early, it seems to me that the answer is\nmandate in a court of appeals.\nMR. FISHER: Well, you -- if you conceived\nthe right as one that you made clear there's a\nviolation at the moment the trial court impermissibly\ndenies counsel of choice, and then perhaps to say --\nand then you went on to say there's either an automatic\nreversal rule or even a Chapman standard, then you\ncould say that there would be a right for mandamus on\nappeal. But then you run into the same problem of\nFlanagan.\nAnd then -- but if you didn't do that and he\nsaid what the United States --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then you\nwouldn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But at that\npoint, the defendant would be well advised to go ahead\nwith trial with his second-choice lawyer. Right?\nMR. FISHER: He may well be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take his chance and\nthen if he -- if he loses, he gets automatic reversal.\nSo why would he do mandamus?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's right.\nMR. FISHER: Well, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you compel him to\nseek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional\nclaim, your -- every incentive is to go right ahead\nwith the trial.\nMR. FISHER: I think in the ordinary case,\nyes, but let me talk about -- let me go back to the\nfacts of this case. I mean, we have a defendant here\nwith only very limited funds. He may decide that I\nonly have enough money to pay one lawyer for one trial,\nand -- and I don't want to depend on this lawyer's good\nwill or something. I mean, so we're getting down the\nline to -- to hypotheticals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think the mandamus\nsolution works unless you compel mandamus, unless you\nsay you lose -- you lose the claim unless you bring\nmandamus.\nMR. FISHER: Yes. I mean, I think I'll\naccept that mandamus doesn't work.\nAnd Justice Kennedy, even on -- even on this\nrecord, if you look at the rule of the Eastern District\nof Missouri for -- for pro hac vice admission, it's\nentirely discretionary on its face. And so it's hard\nto imagine what your mandamus argument would be. And,\nof course, here the Eighth Circuit just issued a one-\nword dismissal.\nSo it's our position that for -- not only for\nthe legal reasons of the historical grounding of -- of\nthe right to counsel of choice and the logical reasons\nwith the differences between the government interfering\nwith what the defendant wants to do versus the\nsituation that we have in Strickland where this Court\nhas said that even if -- if the government doesn't do\nanything at all -- and this Court emphasized in\nStrickland that -- another difference between\nStrickland and this case is the -- is that the\ngovernment is powerless in the Strickland scenario to\nprevent -- to prevent the constitutional violation. When\nwe have the difference here of the government acting to\ninterfere with the way the defendant wants to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the government,\nyou're including the court in that.\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry. When I say the\ngovernment, I mean the court or a prosecutor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not always\ntrue in a Strickland case. It's often the court that's\nmaking the mistakes that the lawyer should have\nobjected to and was incompetent in not doing so.\nMR. FISHER: Well, but then those sorts of\nmistakes aren't necessarily a Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel arguments, I don't think, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThose might be different kinds of mistakes.\nBut here, what we're talking about is the\ncourt interfering with the right -- the Sixth Amendment\nright the defendant has. And in the cases that\nStrickland expressly distinguished and which the United\nStates accepts in footnote 3 of its brief and in the\nself-representation cases, which -- which recognized\nthat the kernel of the defendant's right is to present\n-- and this is what the Court said in McKaskle. The\ncore Faretta right is the -- is the defendant's right\nto present the case to the jury the way he wants to\nsubmit it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, your comment about the\ndefendant running out of a funds is -- raises a good\npoint. So the remedy would be an automatic reversal in\na case like that where the defendant would be\nrepresented by appointed counsel?\nMR. FISHER: What we have in -- what we have\nin this case is a lawyer who was retained and who's --\nwho is willing to go forward under that retainer and in\na pro bono sense. So -- so, I mean, even under this\nCourt's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In this case.\nMR. FISHER: Even under the current -- yes,\nin this case. Even under the -- even under the current\njurisprudence, Justice Alito, you're right. The\ndefendant sometimes may not be able to be put all the\nway back into the position he -- he would have been.\nBut here, we submit that the lower court's\nrule of -- of automatic reversal is the proper rule.\nIt's the one that's working, and it's the one this\nCourt should -- should refuse to change today.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many -- how many\ncircuits are applying that rule?\nMR. FISHER: It's roughly -- roughly half the\ncircuits have addressed this issue on direct appeal,\nand they've all said this is structural error, Justice\nScalia.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nsubmit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFisher.\nMr. Dreeben, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nRespondent's submission in the Eighth\nCircuit's holding in this case is fundamentally\nanomalous in two respects.\nThe first is that it is anomalous when\ncompared to the other rights that this Court has\nacknowledged protection of under the Sixth Amendment\nbecause it accords to a defendant who had the full\nopportunity to select his counsel and to select a\nbackup counsel the same remedy as a defendant who had\nno lawyer at all.\nAnd it's anomalous factually because a\ndefendant who is deprived of his first-choice counsel\nmay have selected that counsel improvidently, may\nselect his second-choice counsel with much greater\ncare, may obtain a lawyer who is far more competent and\nfar more effective, and all of those things have to be\ndiscarded on Respondent's view and the Eighth Circuit's\nholding and automatic reversal ordered, forcing society\nto bear the costs of a retrial even when there is no\nreasonable probability or it is a beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that no lawyer could have made a difference.\nAnd the proper accommodation of the values\nthat are at stake in this case is to recognize that\nsome form of prejudice inquiry is appropriate before\nthis Court imposes on the judicial system the extreme\nconsequence of automatic reversal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Mr. Dreeben, do you\nagree with his characterization that all the courts of\nappeals go the other way?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. The Seventh Circuit made\nperfectly clear in the Rodriguez case that it was\nrejecting on the merits the view that automatic\nreversal is warranted. And the view that automatic\nreversal is warranted largely arose from a\nmisunderstanding of this Court's Flanagan decision in\nwhich dictum was quoted as if it were a holding and\nbecause the courts failed to triangulate the right in\nquestion here with the right that this Court has\nrecognized in the ineffectiveness context and in the\nconflicts context.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
