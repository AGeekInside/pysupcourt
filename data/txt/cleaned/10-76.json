        "content": "(11:15 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-76, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations v.\nBrown.\nMr. Feder.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FEDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals asserted\njurisdiction over Petitioners in this case on claims\nthat arose from a bus accident in France that was\nunrelated to any North Carolina contacts. Although the\nPetitioners are located overseas and do not conduct any\nbusiness in North Carolina, the court held that North\nCarolina had general jurisdiction over these defendants\nbased solely on the sale in North Carolina of a small\nfraction of their products.\nUnder this Court's cases, the mere sale of a\ndefendant's products in a State does not permit the\nState to reach out to assert judicial power over all of\nthat defendant's worldwide conduct. If that were\npermissible, every significant seller of products would\nbe subject to suit everywhere on any claim arising\nanywhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one piece of this\nI don't quite comprehend. You -- there's no contest\nthat there is jurisdiction over the parent, right?\nMR. FEDER: Yes, Your Honor. The parent\ncompany consented to jurisdiction in North Carolina.\nIt's appointed an agent for service of process there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's -- it's based on\nconsent?\nMR. FEDER: Yes. They also have other\nbusiness that the parent does conduct in North Carolina,\nbut there is no objection to jurisdiction over the\nparent here. This case solely concerns the Petitioners,\nwho are corporations from Turkey, France, and\nLuxembourg.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think there is\ngeneral jurisdiction over the parent? If the consent\nwere not in the picture, is there? Does general\njurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal\nplace of business?\nMR. FEDER: I think that that is a hard\nquestion, Your Honor. The short answer is I think the\nanswer is \"no,\" but I think that that is probably a\nclose case -- again, putting aside the consent. But I\ndo think that general jurisdiction is about suing a\ncompany -- at least in the case of corporations, is\nabout suing the corporation essentially where it's\nlocated or at home. It's always fair to bring a suit\nagainst the corporation there.\nI think that once you get beyond that, which\nis a situation that would be analogous to a State's\npower over a citizen or a resident of the State, I think\nyou run into great difficulty finding a basis for the\nState to assert authority over claims completely\nunrelated to any business that -- or any contacts that\nthe corporation has with the State.\nThat said, it wasn't contested here, and\nthere is a consent to service of process, which may or\nmay not create general jurisdiction. There's a\ndisagreement in the lower courts on that, but none of\nthat is contested in this case.\nAnd without having to get to that particular\nquestion of whether in fact it's limited to -- whether\ngeneral jurisdiction is limited to place of\nincorporation or principal place of business, first of\nall, there's much more directly controlling authority.\nIn this case, the most directly relevant cases are\nHelicopteros and Consolidated Textile v. Gregory,\nworking in tandem.\nIn Helicopteros, which was this Court's last\ncorporate general jurisdiction case, the Court said that\nthere was no general jurisdiction based on $4 million in\npurchases in the State and some other contacts. And the\nkey is that -- on that point, is that the Court held\nthat mere purchases could not provide the basis for\ngeneral jurisdiction because the pre-International Shoe\ndecision in Rosenberg was controlling on that point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, this is\npreliminary, and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion. Suppose you could help me out. I assume that\nthere's general jurisdiction over the parent company.\nThen under respondeat superior, it would be liable in\nNorth Carolina for the -- all the acts of its agents.\nMR. FEDER: I think that's a fair\nassumption.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why isn't it\nautomatically liable for all the acts of its\nsubsidiaries?\nMR. FEDER: Well, because I think -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and does that\nget -- and does that get into what in the Federal\npractice would be necessary parties?\nMR. FEDER: What -- Your Honor, I think that\nreally what it gets into is the difference between a\nsubsidiary and an agent, because a subsidiary is not\nautomatically acting as the agent of the parent company\nin a way where you'd get respondeat superior. And I\nthink that part of what's going on in this case is that\nwhen this does go back to North Carolina for trial or\nfor litigation against the parent company, I think that\nunder North Carolina or whatever State's or nation's\nveil piercing or agency standards the North Carolina\ncourts will apply, the plaintiffs will have great\ndifficulty actually with the substantive case against\nthe parent company, because you would actually have to\nshow involvement in the actions that actually the claim\narose out of here.\nThe mere general control that's inherent in\nthe parent-subsidiary relationship is not going to\ncreate liability, and here -- important to remember -\nwe're talking about a tire manufactured in Turkey,\naccident in France which Goodyear Tire and Rubber\nCompany -- and, now, this is outside the record, as I\nunderstand it -- did not have any direct connection\nwith. Again, not relevant to the jurisdictional\nquestion here, but I -- just for sort of setting the -\nthe context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are met with an\nargument that it's all one ball of wax. Parent and sub,\nthey merge; it's one enterprise. And so if the subs do\nsomething any place, the parent is -- it's all part of\none thing, so -- and I think that was the principal\nargument made by the Respondents.\nMR. FEDER: Yes, Your Honor, and I would\nsay, again, when it comes to liability in Goodyear Tire\nand Rubber, they'll be free to make that argument. That\nargument is not properly presented here. It was never\nmade below.\nIt was never -- it was not made in the brief\nin opposition to cert, so any argument for ignoring\ncorporate distinctions or an enterprise theory -- none\nof that was made and, therefore, has been waived. I\nthink that, secondly, as we indicated in our reply\nbrief -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We haven't resolved a whole\nlot if we leave that question open, have we? You want\nus to write an opinion that says, unless you -- unless\nyou ignore the separate corporate existence of the\nsubsidiary -- parenthesis, a question on which we\nexpress no opinion, close parenthesis -- there can be no\njurisdiction in cases like this? Is that the kind of an\nopinion that the world is waiting for?\nMR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nactually in -- if the Court were to write that, it would\nbe left with the important general jurisdiction question\nthat the court below decided incorrectly, and\nincorrectly in a few ways.\nI think that, in fact, there would be\nseveral ways for this Court to approach it, all of which\nwould actually help to clear up the law in this area. I\nthink that even if one gets past the waiver point -- and\nthe reason the Court shouldn't get past the waiver point\nis, among other things, because it wasn't raised -- we,\nof course, had no opportunity to put in evidence that,\nin fact, these corporations are run separately,\nindependent decision making, observation of corporate\nform, and all the other things that would normally go\ninto it.\nIf you want to reach it, first of all, there\nis -- even on the standards articulated in the\nRespondents' brief, there's nothing in the record to\nsupport it, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were saying\nwe should not even -- not even address the situation\nwhere there is no special basis for ignoring the -- the\nseparate incorporation. I -- of course, we should not\nget into questions of whether, in fact, the subsidiary\nwas a sham -\nMR. FEDER: Oh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that there was control,\nall of that, but the simple question of whether, when\nyou have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are\nyour actions.\nMR. FEDER: That, I think, the Court -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we have to reach\nthat?\nMR. FEDER: You certainly do have to reach\nthat, Your Honor. The Court has reached it and decided\nit before, and has said that the mere parent-subsidiary\nrelationship does not create attribution one to the\nother, most recently in Keeton, in which the Court cited\nsome of its older cases for that very proposition.\nAnd I think that in -- another way to look\nat it is, even if you wanted to treat the sales in North\nCarolina as if they were made there directly by these\nPetitioners -- in other words, even if you picked -\nassuming arguendo that you could attribute those sales\ndirectly to the Petitioners and not, as the court below\nfound, treat them as not having been caused by them,\nthat does not come close to satisfying what is required\nfor general jurisdiction.\nAnd, in particular, in going back to\nHelicopteros and Gregory, just as the Rosenberg case was\nbinding in Helicopteros on the point that mere purchases\nare not enough for general jurisdiction, here\nConsolidated Textile v. Gregory is binding on the flip\nside of that, which is that mere sales in the State are\nnot enough for general jurisdiction.\nEven if Gregory weren't binding, I think\nthat you could look at Helicopteros and say there is no\nreal basis for a distinction between mere purchases and\nmere sales. But, in fact, there is a case directly on\npoint, and as well as a lot of case law from the time of\nGregory more generally requiring much more substantial\n-- a substantial physical presence in the State. In\nterms of -- I think no personal jurisdiction argument\nshould go by without talking about International Shoe,\nand if you look at just the International Shoe line of\ncases, even aside from this issue of Gregory being\nbinding, the decision below is equally, if not more,\nuntenable.\nInternational Shoe itself recognizes -- in\nsort of carving out an area for what eventually came to\nbe called general jurisdiction, it recognizes the\nextraordinary nature of the State power that we're\ntalking about when we talk about general jurisdiction,\nwhich is this power to reach out and assert State power\nover things that by hypothesis have no relationship to\ncontacts with the State. International Shoe uses the\nlanguage saying that you need continuous corporate\noperations within the State and says that these\ncontinuous corporate operations have to be so\nsubstantial and of such a nature as to justify this\njurisdiction over conduct that is entirely unconnected\nto the State.\nThe one case where the Court has upheld\ngeneral jurisdiction since International Shoe over a\ncorporation is Perkins, which was a case that involved\nthe corporation's principal place of business. And in\nHelicopteros, following Perkins, when the Court\narticulated the standard there, the Court said that\nwe're looking to see whether there are contacts of the\nsort that we found to exist in Perkins. So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Perkins is kind of an\nunusual case, because it was a company that at the time\nwas doing business only in Ohio. It was a Philippine\nmining company, and it was World War II, so the mines\ncouldn't be run. So to the extent that the corporation\nwas existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.\nMR. FEDER: That's right, Your Honor, and I\nguess what I would say about that is that it's\nunusual -- those are unusual facts, but not unusual in\nterms of what is required to be able to assert general\njurisdiction.\nThe Court in Keeton later described Perkins\nas essentially involving the corporation's principal\nplace of business, and I think that's right because in\norder for the State to be able to assert jurisdiction\nover things unrelated to the State, you need that type\nof relationship equivalent to a citizen or resident that\ngives a State authority over the corporation's actions\nworldwide and not just -- because this goes far beyond\nspecific jurisdiction where the State has a manifest\ninterest in an accident or a claim that arose in the\nState or connected to the State.\nHelicopteros, just to circle back on that\npoint, does say we're looking for contacts of the sort\nfound to exist in Perkins, and -- and as we said, said\nthat even $4 million in purchases were not enough. I\nthink that all of those cases help to make it clear why\nthe mere sales here are not enough.\nAnd if there are no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Horwich.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe North Carolina State court was wrong to\nassert general personal jurisdiction over Petitioners,\nextending potentially to any claim against them arising\nout of any conduct of theirs anywhere in the world, and\nthere are several ways to see why that's wrong. Even if\nthe Court were to accept the proposition that such\ncontacts with North Carolina as there are in the record\nshould be attributed to Petitioners, those contacts\nstill don't rise to the level of what this Court has -\nhas demanded in terms of continuous and systematic\ncontacts.\nAnd even setting those more -- those more\nprecedential tests aside, I think there's also a -- the\nresult of the North Carolina court's decision is that\nthe jurisdictional consequences here would be quite\ndisproportionate to the contacts that -- that -- on\nwhich it would be based.\nSo if I can, I guess, turn for a moment to\nthe continuous and systematic contacts proposition,\nwhich this Court has certainly not elaborated in its\ncase law, but I think it -- it would be -- I think it's\nuseful to speak of, of what exactly the Court was trying\nto get at. And what we think the Court was trying to\nget at, particularly by -- as my friend referred to,\nparticularly by its reference in Helicopteros to Perkins\nas -- as being sort of a benchmark for what continuous\nand systematic contacts are, I think it requires seeing\nan active volitional undertaking by the -- by the\ndefendant. It can't be based on the contact -- conduct\nof third parties. Obviously, the continuous concept of\nexisting without interruption.\nAnd with respect to systematic, we think\nthat that means there needs to be a plurality of\ncontacts, they have to be of different kinds or\nqualities in a sense of perhaps employment as well as\ncontractual as well as regulatory as well as property as\nwell as sales or purchases, and that those contacts\ntogether have to have some interrelationship that\nresults in something that might be thought of as more\nthan the sum of their parts. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose it's just a\ncorporation that's registered to do business in North\nCarolina, and the connection with that registration -\nit says: I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive\nprocess for any and all claims.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, as -- as Mr. Feder\nreferred -- referred to, there -- there is a division in\nthe lower courts on whether that sort of a consent is\neffective to permit the State general jurisdiction\nover -- over the consenting party. That -- but the\nCourt has, I -- I think, been -- been fairly clear in -\nin setting notions of -- of formal consent to one side\nwhen considering contacts-based cases. And so, in part,\nthis case, therefore, doesn't present that question, and\nwe don't have a position, as the Government, on that\ntoday with respect to whether that's effective.\nBut it certainly is the case that simply\nbecause one entity in a Goodyear family of -- of related\ncorporations has consented, that somehow that consent\nshould extend to the entire enterprise. And if I can\nmaybe take a minute to talk about where we think the\nRespondents' view of -- of this enterprise jurisdiction\ngoes wrong, because we touched on it only -- only\nbriefly in our brief, which was, of course, filed before\ntheirs.\nWhen -- when a court confronts a -- a set of\n-- a corporate family, if you will, there seem to be two\nprinciples that can be usefully applied in determining\nthe jurisdictional consequences of that relationship.\nOne is the alter ego concept, which certainly doesn't\nseem to be supported on anything in the record here in\nthe sense that there's -- that there's no sound\nsuggestion in the record that -- that the European\nentities were somehow a sham, that they didn't have any\nseparate existence, they were undercapitalized or any of\nthe other indicia that you would see.\nAnd so, to your point, Justice Scalia, I\nthink it is certainly something the Court could say that\nthe record here is no basis for that kind of a decision\nto disregard the corporate separateness.\nThen the other concept is the agency\nconcept. And I think that may be what -- what\nRespondents are placing somewhat greater reliance on.\nAnd we certainly -- we certainly have the view that an\nagent, acting on behalf of a principal within the scope\nof its agency, can take actions that create contacts\nwith the jurisdiction that are, by virtue of the agency\nrelationship, attributable back to the principal.\nBut there are -- there are two important\nthings to realize, that that -- that that proposition is\nsomewhat modest in that, first of all, simply because\na -- a parent owns a subsidiary does not mean the\nsubsidiary is the parent's agent. Plenty of parents\nsimply own subsidiaries as property or for various\nbusiness reasons. It doesn't mean the subsidiary is\nautomatically always acting as the agent of the parent\nfor all purposes or any at all.\nAnd -- and the second thing to be cautious\nabout in applying the agency principle is that the\nagency relationship only runs one way; that is to say\nthe agent can do something that creates a contact on\nbehalf of the principal, but that's not to say that\neverything the principal does in its independent\nactivities says anything about what contacts its agent\nhas. That's exactly backwards.\nIn the -- and so, here the -- the allegation\nactually in the complaint is that the European companies\nare the agents of the parent -- of the -- of the\nGoodyear U.S. entity. That's -- that's paragraph 16 of\nthe complaint at page 112 of -- 122 of the joint\nappendix. So it -- it might be -- it -- there might be\nan argument that something that the European\nsubsidiaries have done, say, in Turkey is something that\ncould be chargeable to the U.S. parent in a case where\nit was relevant what the parent's relationship with\nTurkey was.\nBut what Respondents are asking for here, in\neffect, turns that completely around and suggests\nimplicitly that the -- the -- this -- the parent of the\nGoodyear organization in the United States was somehow\ndoing the bidding, acting at the direction and control\nof the European companies as principals.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich -\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I ask you a different\nkind of question? And I apologize in advance for taking\nyou a little bit far afield. But -- but I wanted to ask\nyou about a particular sentence in your brief that seems\nto have some relevance to -- not the general\njurisdiction question but some relevance to specific\njurisdiction. So this is on page 20.\nYou say: \"If mere 'purposeful availment' of\ncommercial opportunities in a particular State\" -- which\nis, of course, the test for specific jurisdiction -- if\nthat purposeful availment \"were sufficient to subject an\nenterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's\ncourts, a corporation that sold its goods to an\nindependent distributor, intending that they be resold\nin all 50 States, could potentially be brought to\njudgment in any State, on any claim against it.\"\nSo I -- I take that -- I understand that to\nread that you think that it is purposeful availment that\nsubjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to\ngeneral jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if\na corporation sold its goods to an independent\ndistributor intending that they be resold in all 50\nStates. Am I reading that correctly?\nMR. HORWICH: No, I don't -- I don't believe\nso, in the sense that I -- I think we were sort of\nassuming arguendo a concept of purposeful availment\nthat -- that would be willing to attribute those -\nthose contacts for purposes of a specific-jurisdiction\n-- excuse me -- for purposes of a specific-jurisdiction\nanalysis. I don't know if that helps with the -- with\nthe answer, but -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, I was hoping that the\nanswer would be \"yes,\" actually.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's at least one\nother person in the courtroom who was hoping that, too.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was wondering why\n-- why is your interest in this case so much greater\nthan it would be in -- in the other case, and this --\nI've been wondering that at the outset, and this\nsentence that Justice Kagan points out brings that into\nfull focus.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, Justice Kennedy, let\nme -- let me put it this way. It -- it -- the\ndifference in our interest in the two cases is at bottom\njust a difference in magnitude, but we think it's a\nfairly significant difference in magnitude in the\nsense -- in the sense that the jurisdictional\nconsequences of an assertion of general jurisdiction are\nthat -- with that one determination, it is the case that\nthat defendant can -- could potentially be brought to\njudgment in a forum for all -- for claims arising from\nany of its conduct anywhere in the world.\nAnd specific jurisdiction by construction,\nby its very nature, is only going to be a determination\n-- whatever the contours of the specific rules that are\nused, it's going to never be more than a determination\nthat jurisdiction in a claim, considering the\nrelationship between the defendant, the forum, and the\nparticular litigation, gives rise to jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, why -- why -- I mean,\nyou've heard the argument in the last case. I mean, it\nseemed that potentially can subject the smallest\nmanufacturer to liability throughout the world because\nit uses the Internet. And -- and that -- I don't know\nwhat the foreign policy -- you've heard treaties\ndiscussed, et cetera. Do you want to say anything?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And briefly.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORWICH: The -- the -- the brief answer\nis that the Internet questions, in particular, are so\ncomplicated and, indeed, so potentially far-reaching\nthat in a case that presented them, our interest might\nvery well be different.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Saved by the bell.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Peddie.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF COLLYN PEDDIE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. PEDDIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Goodyear Petitioners ask this Court to\nassist them in avoiding the jurisdiction of the North\nCarolina court. This Court should decline for two\nreasons. First, there's nothing new here. Ample\nevidence supports North Carolina's exercise of general\njurisdiction over the Petitioners under very well\nestablished general jurisdiction and due process\nprinciples. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think there's something\nvery new about this, because general jurisdiction is\nall-purpose jurisdiction, and for a corporation it's\nsort of like a residence for an individual. I think Mr.\nFeder was making that point.\nWhat's -- what's troubling here is that the\nNorth Carolina court seems to be blending the two\ntogether: specific jurisdiction based on the claim\narising in the forum, and general jurisdiction with a\nclaim that has nothing to do with the forum, and its\ninsertion of jurisdiction over any and all claims. And\nI do not know of any case post-International Shoe -- the\nonly thing that we have is Perkins v. Benguet.\nIs there -- is there any case in which this\nCourt has sanctioned the assertion of general\njurisdiction based on some prior -- some product coming\ninto the State, not the product that caused the injury\nabroad? I don't know of any case.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, if that's -- if\nthat's the characterization of the case and that's all\nyou had, then there wouldn't be a case. Our argument\nhere, and I think the -- what the -- what the evidence\nin this case bears out is that is not the case here.\nThe characterization of the case by both the Government\nand by Petitioners is that there is simply mere sales\nhere, and they ignore how the sales occurred.\nOur focus is on how the sales occurred, and\nI think Justice Scalia made a -- a correct distinction,\nthat what we're doing here is not talking about\nattribution, that -- that sort of thing, and -- and\nsimply saying that because someone down the line sold\nthem, without any other discussion, there's general\njurisdiction. That's not correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, you don't\ndefend the reasoning of the State supreme court?\nMS. PEDDIE: I think that the -- the State\nsupreme court did a lot of things right, but, as we say\nin the brief, we think that they took a detour in using\ninappropriate stream-of-commerce language that isn't\nthere. It's not that they didn't have help doing it.\nFor example, the Petitioners have changed their tune\nhere. They talked routinely about purposeful availment\nin their briefs to the court of appeals and to the\nsupreme court. For example, page 327 of their brief\nrequests that they -- that they find purposeful\navailment here. So the court had a lot of help.\nBut that part of the opinion we don't really\nthink is appropriate, nor is it necessary. The point\nthat I'm making about there being nothing new is that\nthere is ample evidence in this case to apply to the\ngeneral jurisdiction principles that were used in\nPerkins and used in Hall and that can cause this Court\nto reach the correct result.\nAs the Court is well aware, this Court can\naffirm on any basis supported in the record, and we\nbelieve that there is a basis in well-established rules\nsupported in the record, whether it agrees with the\ncourt of appeals' decision or not. It's not bound by\nthat analysis, nor are we.\nI'd like to address the question of waiver\nbecause it's -- it's come up. I think that the\nSolicitor General has correctly -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you've got -- you\nhave me in suspense.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me why it is that the\ngeneral principles of jurisdiction do apply here, and\nthen we can get to waiver.\nMS. PEDDIE: Okay, okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't leave me dangling\nlike that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, as far back as -\nas Burger King, this Court recognized that commercial\nactivities, when they're conducted on behalf of an\nout-of-State party, can sometimes be attributed. Even\nthe Solicitor General agrees that there's a different\njurisdictional analysis that may apply over and above\nsomething like Cannon or Rush v. Savchuk, if there are\ncase-specific interactions between particular affiliated\ncorporations as you have here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Case-specific\nis not talking about general jurisdiction.\nMS. PEDDIE: No, no, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's talking about specific\njurisdiction.\nMS. PEDDIE: But what they're talking about\nare that there are evidentiary case-specific\ninteractions between the parties that would lead to the\nconclusion of general jurisdiction and thus subjecting\nthem to suit on -- in dispute-blind -- or dispute-blind\njurisdiction.\nIn addition, this Court has used in a\nvariety of other areas a unitary business principle for\nlocal taxation in Mobil. And even as far back as 15\nyears ago, the Hague Convention, our trade partners that\nare complained of here, talked about the fact that\nusing -- attributing contacts or counting contacts that\nwere based on conduct performed by others was\nappropriate and was not really a sticking point and that\nthey were perfectly content to leave that to other\ncases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Just give me a list\nof -- of what -- what factors you think support general\njurisdiction here.\nMS. PEDDIE: In terms of the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One, two, three, four -\nMS. PEDDIE: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which ones are they?\nMS. PEDDIE: Okay. In this case I think\nit's the part -- and, frankly, we'll use the Solicitor\nGeneral's definition of a system, from their brief at -\nat page 23, where they talked about conduct that forms a\nsystem and aggregation of objects united by some form of\nregular activity or interdependent.\nUsing their definition, I think you ask the\nquestion: Is a defendant part of a continuous business\nsystem or enterprise that conducts general business\nactivities in the forum? And the first question you\nasked is: Is it a single system or an enterprise? This\nCourt has said in Mobil Oil that a unitary business is\nidentified by -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Peddie, you haven't\n-- you don't have anything in the record about this\nbeing a unitary business. Unless you're trying to\npresent some sweeping piercing-the-corporate-veil\ntheory, there is nothing here that says that these\naren't corporations that are acting separately, that\nhave their own officers, have their own employees, keep\ntheir own books. There's nothing to show that it's all\npart of one enterprise.\nMS. PEDDIE: I disagree with that, Your\nHonor. Under the sort of traditional measures that the\nCourt has used in terms of -- of ownership, et cetera, I\ndon't think there is anything. But even the Solicitor\nGeneral concedes, at page 27 of their brief, that the\ncourt of appeals effectively treated the parent and\nsubsidiary corporations as an undifferentiated entity\nfor distribution of the Petitioners' product, and that\nwas our position below. And I think if you look at -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question isn't\nwhether they did that; the question is whether it was\nright to do that.\nMS. PEDDIE: That -- that's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you don't make your\npoint by saying that the court of appeals made a\nmistake.\nMS. PEDDIE: No, no. But I think -- I think\nwhat -- what -- at least as I understood her question -\nand I may have misunderstood her question -- was is\nthere anything in the record where -- where they had\ndone that. I think the -- the evidence in the record is\npart and parcel of the fact findings that the trial\ncourt made about the existence of a highly integrated\nsupply and distribution system in the -- that operates\nin the State.\nThe number of tires, for example, that\nPetitioners manufactured in North Carolina was\ndetermined solely by orders that were solicited in North\nCarolina by Goodyear and forecasts made by Goodyear\nbased on data that they gathered there. On the\ndistribution side, the testimony from Mr. Kramer was\nthat they don't send tires for distribution; they don't\ndo any distribution. It was an internal distribution\nsystem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, those\narrangements could exist with a lot of distributors.\nYou don't want to ship a distributor stuff that the\ndistributor is not going to be using.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, my goodness. The\nfact that you coordinate with your distributor how much\nof your product you're going to ship to him doesn't -\ndoesn't really show -\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you are a unitary\nbusiness with your distributor.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think this goes\nway beyond coordination. For example, Mr. Kramer\ntestified that, quote, \"Their job is just to be given a\nforecast or a ticket, and then they just build widgets.\"\nThat's all they do. They were complete -- their -\ntheir solicitation and their production was solely based\non the control and the requests from the parent. The\nrequests, as he testified, quote, \"emanate from the\nrequests that Goodyear would make.\" And the production\nand supply system was the same for all of them.\nOn the distribution side, the testimony was\neven more -- I think was even more limited in that he\nsaid the plant in Turkey doesn't control any\ndistribution. They wouldn't send anything into United\nStates without the approval and sanction of the parent,\nand anything else, quote, \"just doesn't happen.\"\nSo this was a closed system. It was\ndominated by -- by the Goodyear parent, and there wasn't\na question of coordination. It was they didn't produce\nunless the parent told them to; they sent it where the\nparent said they should send it to; and when it got to\nthe United States, the testimony is, is that the parent\ncontrolled it at that point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the \"it\" wasn't the\nproduct that caused the injury here. As I understand\nthe case, the tire that allegedly caused this bus to\nturn over was designed for the European and Asian\nmarkets, not the U.S. market.\nMS. PEDDIE: The Goodyear Regional RHS tire\nthat was on the bus and that failed was not generally\ndesigned for the U.S. market, although it was brought\nover here under special circumstances.\nThe tires we're talking about are of three\nkinds. There are passenger and bus tires that you would\nordinarily see that would be sold individually;\nsecond -- a second category are tires that were sold as\noriginal equipment on cars and buses; and, third, and\nthe predominant type that were sent to the United\nStates, were specialty tires for so-called low boy\ntrailers which were horse trailers, boat trailers, of\nwhich there are in many North Carolina.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why did -- why should\n-- Mr. Feder brought up the Helicopteros, and he said in\nthat case, it was purchases; and in this case, it's\nsales. And in the purchaser case, certainly we said no,\nthere's no general jurisdiction. Why should it be any\ndifferent?\nMS. PEDDIE: I think the distinction between\nHall and Perkins is not so much purchases and sales,\nit's which contacts do you count? And the language that\nis sort of forgotten in Hall is the language that they\ntalk about -- you needed to have the same general\nbusiness contacts that you had in Perkins.\nI think the difference is, is that purchases\nare sort of a one-shot deal. They may be supplies,\nbut -- but they're more irregular, but the core business\nis selling -- is selling items, and so sales count more\nthan purchases.\nI apologize for interrupting.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Perkins, it was the\nhome of the corporation. There was no other at the\ntime, because their permanent home was not functioning\nbecause of the war. So there was only one place.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think the facts\nof that case are -- is that one officer of the\ncorporation came home, and he was -- he maintained\ntwo -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He was the president of\nthe corporation.\nMS. PEDDIE: He was the president of the\ncorporation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And whatever business it\nwas doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio.\nMS. PEDDIE: Right. And the Court\ncharacterized that -- I think there's a difference\nbetween what the Court did in Perkins and how it was\ndescribed in Keeton. That's the language that the\nPetitioners have used.\nBut the language that the Court used in\nPerkins was that the decision was based on the\nsupervisory activities; not the fact that it was the\nprincipal place of business, but the fact that the\nsupervision over, for example, the renovation of the\nfactory after the war took place in the forum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you about the\nramifications of your theory that there's general\njurisdiction in North Carolina over these three\nsubsidiaries?\nSuppose that one of the children on a bus\nwas a Canadian citizen, was going home to Canada. And\nhad the idea that juries in North Carolina are more\nliberal than in France. Well, there wouldn't be any\njury in France, but -- so could the Canadian come and\nsue because there's general jurisdiction in the United\nStates?\nMS. PEDDIE: I think it would depend upon a\nlot of factors, Your Honor. Are you assuming that\nthere's -- it's established that there's general\njurisdiction there, or are we in the same fact pattern\nas here?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, you -- we're talking\nabout Goodyear and these three subsidiaries. You say\nthere's general jurisdiction in North Carolina. Those\ncompanies can be sued on any and all claims.\nSo my question is: Could anyone on that bus\nthat turned over in Paris come to North Carolina to\nbring the wrongful death, or whatever, suit?\nMS. PEDDIE: I think -- I think, in theory,\nthey could; I think, in practice, the case would never\nstay there because of the controls that we talked about\non forum shopping; about, particularly, forum non\nconveniens. One of the suggestions, for example, that\nwe made is one may want to consider for due -- for due\nprocess purposes the residence of the plaintiff. Is it\nfair, for example, to have a case in North Carolina\nwhere the plaintiff doesn't live in North Carolina, as\nthey do here, but lives in Canada?\nSo that's -- that's one limitation. And as\nthis Court said in the Sinochem case, you can look at\nthe forum non conveniens issue before you look at the\njurisdictional issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's an -- that's\nan odd way to think about general jurisdiction. General\njurisdiction is principally status -- your residence,\nthe principal place of business, the place of\nincorporation. And this -- these factors that you're\nmentioning are -- in fact, some of the factors you\nmention in the brief are quite different than that.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think if -- if\nthe limitation -- if the Court's view is basically the\nPetitioners', that you are limited to principal place of\nbusiness, State of incorporation, and physical presence,\nwhich we don't think is the state of the law, and,\nfrankly, if it were the state of the law, then we would\nhave a Hague Convention now and it wouldn't have taken\n20 years to negotiate.\nIf -- if that's the position that the Court\nis taking, then I don't think that -- you know, that\nthis case represents something different. I think that\nthe state of the law is that -- or at least the\nprofessed state of the law is that it is based on\ncontinuous and systematic contacts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Peddie, let's assume\nthat you're right, that on some level that some -- that\nit's not just the place of incorporation or the\nprincipal place of business, that it could be created by\nsomething more. The only something more here is\nGoodyear USA, so your adversary is right that what\nyou're asking us to do is sort of a reverse\nprincipal-agent.\nYou're saying that the subsidiary has used\nthe principal, its owner, as its agent. That's\nreally -- that's the core problem with your argument,\nisn't it?\nMS. PEDDIE: Your -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because without the\nGoodyear USA activities, there's no other activity by\nthe foreign corporations.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think what -\nwhat we're talking about is not so much attribution as\nmore of a merger or a joint activity. What we're saying\nis that there is a system, by the Solicitor General's\nown definition, the kind of interdependent relationship\nthat the Solicitor General -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does -- do any of these\ncompanies, the Goodyear Turkey Company, the others -- do\nany of them sell the tires directly to Goodyear USA for\ndistribution to the United States? As I understand it,\nthese tires were sold to other entities, foreign\nentities, who then sold them to the U.S.\nMS. PEDDIE: That's -- that's not borne out\nby the record. That -- it was represented by the\nPetitioners. We put a footnote in the brief that the\ncitations that they give do not bear that out. There's\nnothing in the record -- and we've read it twice since\nthen -- that indicates that they were sold. And they\nhave backed off on that in their reply brief.\nInstead, the -- there were three methods of\ndistribution. They are discussed at page 265 of the\nbrief. Items were either sent directly from the factory\nto the buyers that were identified by Goodyear. They\nwere either then sent to Goodyear that took ownership or\ntook possession of them when they arrived in the United\nStates. They were put in warehouses and sold outside of\nthose, but there were several distribution methods.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At page 265 of the brief?\nI didn't read that many pages.\nMS. PEDDIE: No, no. Excuse me. Page 265\nof the Joint Appendix. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Peddie, this is just a\n-- this is an I'm-just-curious question: Why do you\ncare? You have Goodyear USA, which has consented to\njurisdiction. Why does it make a difference to get\nthese other companies in the North Carolina courts?\nDoes North Carolina not make Goodyear USA substantively\nliable for this accident?\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, North Carolina has\nparticularly Draconian requirements for piercing the\ncorporate veil and alter ego, some of which Petitioners\nrefer to. For example, the proximate causation of the\nwrong has to be related to the domination and control,\nand so ideally it would be great if we could go back and\nsimply deal with them and let them collect from their -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So -- but what you're\nsaying, then, is that North Carolina treats the parent\nand the subs very differently as a matter of substantive\nlaw, but you would want identical treatment as a matter\nof jurisdiction?\nMS. PEDDIE: Right. They have very -- in\nmost States, frankly, there's a -- a lesser requirement\nfor the exercise of jurisdiction, merely allowing the\nsuit to go forward, than there is for actual imputation\nof liability or imposition of liability, and so North\nCarolina, I think, is a very good example of that.\nThey have a fairly liberal requirement or\nstate of the law that we've cited in the Manley case,\nwhere general personal jurisdiction exists over a\nforeign corporation where it is controlled by or\ncontrols a local corporation. And that's the Wyatt\nConfectionary case that we cited in the -- excuse me -\nthe Chocolate Confectionary case cited in the Manley\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure that that\nanswered -- I understood you to be saying that,\nsubstantively, they might not be liable for the defect\nthat caused the accident. Is that it?\nMS. PEDDIE: Yes. That -- I mean, we -- I\nthink you have to understand that this case is at a very\nembryonic state. We've done no discovery in this case.\nThis was a -- an appeal, an interlocutory appeal from\nthe denial of a motion to dismiss, and so there's been\none deposition on a very limited jurisdictional issue.\nSo we've not had an opportunity to develop the facts.\nWe hope we will be able to develop those\nfacts, but what we're faced with here is a situation\nwhere North Carolina would permit the exercise of\njurisdiction under its well-established law on general\npersonal jurisdiction, but when it comes to the\nimposition of liability for substantive purposes, that\nmay be a much, much -- much tougher sledding. And so in\norder to preserve the interests of our client, we've -\nwe've gone down this road as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have any case law\nthat supports your position, which, I take it -- and\ncorrect me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is\nsubject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long\nas some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by\nthe parent to the -- to buyers in the forum State?\nMS. PEDDIE: No, Your Honor, because that's\nnot our position here. Our position is that if you\nparticipate in this kind -- not a general one, but in\nthis kind of very tightly controlled system,\ndistribution and supply system, then there is general\njurisdiction in the forum over the foreign subsidiary\nthat participates in this. But simply generally having\na parent-subsidiary relationship and shipping goods into\nthe forum, that's not what we're contending. And,\nfrankly, I don't think that that would be a situation in\nwhich general jurisdiction would apply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I see nothing in the\nNorth Carolina court's opinion that explains that this\nis the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate\nthe distinction between parent and sub.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, they do talk\nrepeatedly about the existence of this highly integrated\ndistribution system. I think it might be helpful to\nsort of flip it over and say what would happen if we\nadopted the Petitioners' view that you ignore the\nsystem, and all you look at is a -- is a few sales. I\nthink that then you would end up with a situation that\nwould be unfair to the State of North Carolina in terms\nof providing a forum for its residents.\nFor example, if I may give a hypothetical,\nif you have a -- not a manufacturing plant in Turkey,\nbut, let's say, in China that is producing a massive\namount of tires for importation into the United States,\nthousands of tires, in this same distribution system.\nBased on their view that it has to be principal place of\nbusiness, State of incorporation, and that mere sales\nare not -- don't count, and it has the same jurisdiction\nsystem, then even that -- that producer -- and, frankly,\nGoodyear is one of those producers -- wouldn't be liable\nin North Carolina if the injury occurred someplace else.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's -- there's a -\nyou open your brief saying something to the effect of\nthis case is about outsourcing, jobs in the U.S. going\nto some subsidiary port. But then these subsidiaries\nare making tires which, on your own admission, very\nrarely come to the United States because they're\ndesigned specifically for vehicles in Asia and in\nEurope. And so I would think that Turkey would be the\nideal location for -- for such a place. I don't get\nyour outsourcing pitch.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, our -- our position\nhere is that you will incentivize outsourcing if you\nagree with the Petitioners' view. With regard to the\nexisting plants, 1,500 miles, which is the distance from\nIstanbul to Paris, is -- is not exactly local\nproduction. But what we're talking about is, again,\nsomething like the example that I gave you of a\nproduction in China, that you have -- and -- and it's\nbased on the definition that we make of outsourcing,\nwhich are jobs that simply were in the United States.\nIf a CEO is faced with a situation of\nlocating a plant in -- in North Carolina and subjecting\nthe production of that plant, even if it's completely\nfor export, and particularly if it's completely for\nexport, to the jurisdiction, the general jurisdiction,\nof the State courts and can put that plant in China and\nsend items around the world and not be subject to the\njurisdiction of North Carolina, where do you think\nthey're going to put that plant?\nNow, I don't disagree that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think he'd rather be\nsued in China?\nMS. PEDDIE: I think they would rather be\nsued in China.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't. I don't know\nwhy anybody would.\nMS. PEDDIE: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And don't you think\nthat's a question as to which we ought to have some\nsensitivity to the views of the United States expressed\nhere by the Solicitor General? It certainly implicates\nforeign relations concerns.\nMS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think that the -\nwell, let me answer this in two ways. The first way is\nthe policy considerations, either on our side or their\nside, are not due process issues.\nAnd the second point that I was going to\nmake was the idea that the Due Process Clause doesn't\ntrump the exercise of jurisdiction over the Petitioners\nhere based on policy. Instead, it has to be a showing\nof unfairness -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nargument about outsourcing sounded an awful lot like a\npolicy argument to me.\nMS. PEDDIE: Well, it is a policy argument,\nbut I think, Your Honor, that -- in all candor, I think\nwe felt the need to -- to respond to the policy\narguments of not just the Government but also to the\nother side.\nI would -- I would say, let me -- if I might\ncomplete -- complete the other thought, is that all of\nthose considerations, as interesting as they are, as\ncompelling as they may seem, you know, are not due\nprocess considerations. This Court really isn't\nempowered to restrict the jurisdiction of State courts\nbased on assisting the United States in negotiating\ntrade treaties; instead, it has to be based on\nunfairness and a showing of undue burden.\nWith regard to -- getting back to the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just not unfairness\nand undue burden. It's a matter of what -- what power a\nsovereign has.\nMS. PEDDIE: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it could be\nperfectly fair if you announce that you're going to\nassert jurisdiction over anybody who harms an American\ncitizen anywhere in the world, and you give notice to\nevery manufacturer in the world. That would be\nperfectly fair, but you have no power to do that\nunder -- under accepted notions of what a sovereign can\ndo.\nMS. PEDDIE: And -- and it would be tempered\nby the -- the burdens test that is articulated in Asahi\nand elsewhere, but none of that impacts, you know,\npolicy considerations such as trade negotiations,\net cetera. And the focus has been fairness and balance\nof interests. And here you have a -- a manufacturer and\nyou have Petitioners who voluntarily participated in an\nenterprise that operates in the State here. And we\nthink that there's nothing unfair about -- when they\nagreed to deal with this, when they made money off of\ndoing this, when they do this on an ongoing basis,\nthere's nothing unfair about -- about subjecting them to\nliability there.\nAnd particularly when you look at the Asahi\nfactors, there's really no burden on the defendants\nhere. One of the things that the Petitioners did not\nrespond to in our -- our brief is the notion that no\nmatter what this Court decides, two of these Petitioners\nare going to be litigating in a foreign country\nanywhere. And the only thing that they have interjected\nas a burden is the presumptive burden of litigating in\nanother country. They're going to be litigating in\nanother country unless a court atomizes this case and\nsays that the Petitioners have to litigate in four\ndifferent states.\nSo there's nothing -- there's nothing to\nsort of suggest that there's -- there's any burden, nor,\ntherefore, a basis for restricting the jurisdiction of\nthe North Carolina State courts based on due process\nconcerns.\nBy contrast -- and the other thing that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only if you believe that\nburden is the only issue. The issue is power, not just\nburden.\nMS. PEDDIE: That's -- that's correct, but\nthe -- but at least this Court has said, since Pennoyer\nv. Neff, that the power is tempered only by the Due\nProcess Clause, not about policy concerns. And so,\nit -- as -- as -- I think the Court is correct that it\nmay be perfectly fair to announce this to the world, but\nit's up to this Court to determine whether due process\nwould restrict the exercise of that power, and it does\nit on an enunciated set of factors, none of which\nincludes assisting the United States in negotiating\ntrade treaties.\nThe Petitioners, I think, as we've\nsuggested, have not really shown any sort of burden\nhere, and they would be litigating with the same lawyers\nin the -- same lawyers in the same forum as their\nparent. And the Court has observed that even the kinds\nof litigation that would take place, the burdens on\nlitigating in a foreign -- foreign forum are much\nreduced, and that was in 1957, the year that I was born.\nThe primary objections here are based on\ntrade. I think it's -- it's interesting that the\nGovernment has -- has talked about those, but I don't\nthink that's a basis for restricting jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you go back?\nYou -- you said something about the two of them are\nsubject to suit. You said this is a question of one\nlawsuit instead of four. Could you explain that?\nMS. PEDDIE: Well, for example, the parent\nand the three Petitioners all have principal places of\nbusiness in four different countries. And we have\ngeneral jurisdiction over the parent in the forum. We\nhave the same lawyers that are representing all the\nparties in the forum, and we intend to go forward in\nthe forum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about France?\nMS. PEDDIE: Well, in France the -- the\nPetitioners from Luxembourg and from Turkey -- if they\nlitigate in France, they're going to be litigating in a\nforeign country as well. And so, our question is: Why\nis it somehow more convenient to litigate in France than\nit is in the United States when you've got the same\nlawyers and the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a question of\nmore convenience. It's a question that the claim arose\nthere, and then, of course, there was -- just because\nthe claim arose there, there would be some convenience\nfactors. All the witnesses to the accident are there;\nwhatever is left of the bus is there.\nMS. PEDDIE: Well, those -- those are the\nforum non conveniens issues that -- that a -- that a\ncourt would consider. But I'm talking about the due\nprocess question in terms of investigating the -- the\nactual burden on the Petitioners in litigating in the\nforum. And the only thing that they've really focused\non is their preference for that forum, which is not a\ndue process concern.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feder, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FEDER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe purported integrated distribution that\nRespondents are pointing to as the basis for ignoring\nthe corporate separation here, whatever else you could\nsay about it and whether it's really any different from\nnormal coordination, it only relates to the tiny\nfraction of Petitioners' business that involved tires\ngoing to the United States.\nSo -- where they didn't normally market\ntheir products, and so, of course, everything that they\nsent to the United States was only when the U.S.\naffiliate reached out to get tires. That does not -\nunder any theory of which I'm aware, even the most\naggressive enterprise theory, that would not amount to a\nbasis for merging the two companies and treating parent\nand sub as if they were one.\nAs far as the hypothetical about China goes,\nI wanted to briefly address that. Of course, to the\nextent that there are a lot of tires sent in from China\nor anywhere else to North Carolina or any other State,\nthere will be specific jurisdiction most likely in those\ncases.\nOur position here is simply that the fact\nthat tires are coming in, over which you may have\nspecific jurisdiction, is no basis to say that you can\nalso bring in North Carolina what general jurisdiction\nwould allow you to bring: claims from workplace\naccidents in China, lease disputes, and whatever else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about special\njurisdiction? Why don't -- why we decide this on the\nbasis of special jurisdiction? It's an accepted basis\nof jurisdiction. Citizenship is. Countries can make it\na crime -- in fact, I think Italy does -- to kill an\nItalian citizen abroad, and that person can be tried for\nthat crime in Italy. So I assume that -- that that is\nan acceptable basis of jurisdiction.\nSo why don't we say that there's a\nspecialized jurisdiction when a citizen of -- of North\nCarolina is -- is injured abroad, so long as there is -\nwhat -- what is the word? The submission to the -- to\nthe courts of North Carolina by having enough contacts\nwith North Carolina. The previous case -- what's that\ncrazy word that's -\nMR. FEDER: Availment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Availment. I meant to look\nthat up. I'm not sure -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's ever been\nused except in this courtroom.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why don't we decide\nit that way?\nMR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I\ndon't think our law has a concept of special\njurisdiction like that, as consistent with the Due\nProcess Clause, and I think that even -- I won't purport\nto speak for the Respondents in the other case, but I\nthink that they would probably agree that if the\naccident had happened to a New Jersey citizen in France,\nthat that would not create, even under their\nstream-of-commerce theory, jurisdiction.\nUnder our due process precedents, you need\npurposeful availment. And for general jurisdiction, of\ncourse, you need quite a bit more than that. And so,\nwhile creative, I don't think that would quite carry the\nday.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there is a\ncountry that has this -- what Justice Scalia -- France,\nin the Civil Code, says that any French citizen can sue\nanybody on any claim in France. But we consider that an\nexorbitant jurisdictional rule.\nMR. FEDER: We -- we do, Your Honor, and\nobviously we wouldn't recognize that under our Due\nProcess Clause, and I think it points up some of the\nreasons why, at least at the margins, it is important to\nbe able to negotiate treaties so that we can avoid\nhaving that sort of jurisdiction exercised against our\ncitizens, just as within the European Community they\nhave an agreement that it's not exercised within that\ncommunity.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
