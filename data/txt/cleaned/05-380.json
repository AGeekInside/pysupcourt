        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 05-380, Gonzales v. Carhart.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nCongress held six hearings over four\ndifferent Congresses and heard from dozens of witnesses\nin determining that partial-birth abortions are never\nmedically necessary, pose health risks, and should be\nbanned. Under familiar principles of deference to\ncongressional factfinding, those determinations should\nbe upheld as long as they represent reasonable\ninferences based on substantial evidence in the\ncongressional record.\nThat standard is amply satisfied here. The\nevidence before Congress was clear that partial-birth\nabortions were never medically necessary, and that safe\nalternatives were always available such that no woman\nwould be prevented from terminating her pregnancy. As a\nresult, Congress was entitled to make a judgment in\nfurthering its legitimate interests that they were going\nto ban a particularly gruesome procedure that blurred\nthe line between abortion and infanticide.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, couldn't\na similar record be made with respect to what is the\nmore common procedure, the D&E, that involves\ndismemberment of a fetus inside the womb. So assuming\nyou're right that it is constitutional for Congress to\nban the D&X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning\napply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with\nrespect to what is the most common method for second\ntrimester abortions?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice\nGinsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in\nparticular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle\nto that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this\nCourt struck down an effort to ban what was then the\nmajority method of inducing a second-term abortion.\nAnd I think in the same way, there is quite\na different situation when Congress comes in and tries\nto deal with the primary abortion method in the second\ntrimester. Here, though, Congress didn't go after the\ndog, so to speak, it went after the tail. This very\naberrant procedure, atypical procedure. And the numbers\nare hard to come by, but I don't think anybody suggests\nthat the D&X procedure is anything more than a very\nsmall minority of second trimester abortions. And so I\ndo think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though we are told\nby some of the medical briefs that the procedures are\nbasically the same, they start out in the same way and\nthat the difference -- the differences are not large in\nparticular cases.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\nlet me make a couple of points in response to that. I\nthink -- taken at the broader level first, I think there\nis one very important difference between these two\nprocedures that led Congress to ban one and allow the\nother to stand. And that is whether fetal demise takes\nplace in utero, which is, of course, the hallmark of all\nabortions, or whether fetal demise, the lethal act takes\nplace when the fetus is more than halfway out of the\nmother.\nNow, as to their suggestion, I think most\nparticularly by Respondents in the second case, that\nthere really is no meaningful difference between those\ntwo procedures. And with respect, I just don't think\nthe record supports that. If you look at the record in\nthis case, it's very clear in the district court opinion\nthat you have some doctors, and examples would be\nPlaintiff's expert, Dr. Creinin, or one of the Nebraska\nPlaintiffs, Dr. Vibhakar. They go in, in each and every\ncase, and try to perform a dismemberment, or D&E,\nprocedure.\nAnd because they're trying to perform the\nD&E procedure, they need to dilate the cervix only\nmodestly. And so Dr. Creinin, for example, his\ntestimony is he only dilates the cervix two centimeters\nor two and a half centimeters.\nNow, in contrast, you have other doctors,\nand here the examples I would point to are two of the\nPlaintiff's experts, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson,\nthey, in every single case, set out to perform the D&X\nprocedure. And that has material differences. For\nexample, the dilation regimen that they use. And so\nDr. Frederickson, for example, uses multiple sets of\nlaminaria to dilate the cervix, and she gets a much\ngreater degree of dilation, 5 to 6 centimeters of\ndilation.\nAnd of course, not only do they set out to\nperform different procedures, but they, in fact, perform\ndifferent procedures. So the evidence here again\nreflects that Dr. Vibhakar, for example, in 100 percent\nof the cases, ends up performing a dismemberment\nprocedure, or a D&E procedure. For Dr. Creinin, it's 99\npercent.\nNow, by contrast, Dr. Chasen and\nDr. Frederickson, when they set out to perform a D&X\nprocedure, they are successful in their objective less\noften. There are different numbers for different\ndoctors, but it seems that, at most, they can achieve\ntheir objective about a third of the time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, those doctors\ntestified in the congressional hearings or in the Eighth\nCircuit or Ninth Circuit or the Second Circuit? There\nare so many doctors here. Which are the two that you're\nreferring to that do not dilate the cervix fully? Did\nthey testify in any of the district court cases?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They did, Justice Kennedy,\nand in particular, Dr. Creinin is an expert. I think\nhis deposition was taken, or his testimony was taken\nprincipally in the California case, but it was\nintroduced in all three cases as part of the evidentiary\nrecord. Dr. Vibhakar is one of the Plaintiffs in this\nparticular case. And Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson\nwould also -- their testimony was in the record, I\nthink, in all three cases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just from my going through\nthis record, I compare it with Stenhart, with what's in\nCongress. We have two cases here. And it's a fair\nconclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress\nand in here, there are some doctors who think this is\nsafe and some doctors who think it isn't safe.\nAnd if you look at the -- sort of by\ncounting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of\ntestimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough,\nit seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases\nand in front of Congress who said it is not safe than\nthere were when we considered the other case. And there\nare fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other\ncase. So I don't know if you're supposed to count\ndoctors or what.\nMy question would be, if this -- do we owe\nmore deference to a congressional finding or to Congress\nthan we owe to a State legislature? What is -- I mean,\nI take it a State legislature is democratically elected,\nand don't we owe similar deference to both?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nthink you certainly owe deference to both. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we owe deference\nto both, and I would have thought that we did, then I\nthink in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that\nwas owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the\nstatute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it\nlacked an exception for the health of the mother,\nsomething that came from preceding cases. So if giving\ndeference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there,\nand if the deference that is owed is the same, and if\nthe evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we\nreach a different conclusion here?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nmean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in\ndiscussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion,\nwhich you wrote. But my reading of that opinion is that\nthis Court did not focus on what was before the Nebraska\nlegislature. But this Court focused on what the\ndistrict court found. And in particular, in the\ncritical part of the opinion, which would be Section\n2(A) of the opinion, as I read the opinion, what this\nCourt did is it confronted Nebraska's argument that the\nD&X procedure was not, in fact, safer.\nAnd the first thing this Court did is said,\nwell, that argument faces quite a burden, because the\ndistrict court made a contrary finding. And then this\nCourt in 2(A)(1) of the opinion referenced that finding,\nand four different times cited the district court\nrecord, and then so on and so forth. It then noted the\nvarious eight arguments were made by the State in its\namici to the contrary. And as I read the opinion, it\nbasically said the latter, the objections don't\noutweigh the former, the findings.\nNow, I think if you compare the record\nbefore the courts and before Congress, compare that to\nwhat was before the district court in Stenberg, I think\nthere is a much more robust factual record here. If you\nlook at the Stenberg case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, are not\nsome of the findings by Congress clearly erroneous? For\nexample, there is a statement that no current medical\nschools provide instruction in the procedure. Now\nthat's clearly wrong, isn't it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, specifically\nwhat Congress found in that finding was that none of\nthem provided it as part of a curriculum. And I think\nwhat the record here clearly reflects -- you know, I\ndon't know that the idea of a curriculum -- I don't know\nexactly what Congress had in mind. But clearly, is a\nmatter of sort of what you teach residents --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think that finding\nis correct?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't know if it's\ncorrect, based on the curriculum.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing there was a lot\nof evidence introduced in the district court that there\nwere schools like Yale and New York University that did\ninclude this as part of a curriculum, could the district\ncourt disregard that finding and make a contrary\nfinding?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think if the evidence in\nthe district court were overwhelmingly to the contrary,\nI think that the district court could effectively\nundermine that one finding. I don't think in this case\nanything turned --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, on other findings,\nis there a different standard of review of what the\ndistrict court found as opposed to what Congress found?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nwould answer you this way. You might first want to\nisolate those situations where, if the district court\nwas addressing something, an issue that just wasn't\nbefore Congress at all, but it's somehow relevant, and\nmakes factual findings, I suppose the district court is\nentitled to the normal kind of deference on review.\nBut I think if you have situations, which\nyou have in this case, where the district court heard\nsome of the same witnesses who testified before Congress\nand before the district court, and the district court\nmakes a different credibility finding than the Congress\nmade, I don't think that's a basis for the district\ncourt to be able to overcome the contrary findings of\nCongress.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't understand\nCongress to have made credibility findings. As I read\nthe -- I read the whole finding. There were six or\nseven pages of findings, and I don't find a single\nreference in those findings to the performance of an\nabortion on a nonviable fetus. All of the language in\nthe findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just\ninches away from becoming a person. And I don't think\nyou can even find the word fetus in those findings. The\nfindings as opposed to the text of the statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure, Justice Stevens, I\nthink I need to clarify an important point there, which\nis to say, the statute didn't focus on viable versus\nnonviable, because it applies to both sides of the\nviability line.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about the\nfindings. Is there a single word in the findings that\nrefers to a viable fetus? It maybe refers to a\nnonviable fetus.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think there is,\nJustice Stevens, but I wouldn't find that at all\nremarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain\nprocedures without regard to whether the procedure is\napplied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when\nCongress does make specific findings that the procedure\nit's banning would have the effect of preventing a\nlethal act on a fetus just inches from being born. It's\nnot --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not preventing the\nlethal act, it is requiring that the lethal act be\nperformed prior to any part of the delivery, because\nthere is no doubt there will be a lethal act. The only\nissue is when it may be performed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The issue is whether --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. Because the issue is\nto whether it's going to be performed in utero, or when the\nchild is more than halfway outside the womb, and that of\ncourse --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whether the fetus is more\nthan halfway out, and some of these fetuses I understand\nin the procedure, are only four or five inches long.\nThey are very different from fully formed babies.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, again,\nyou're right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When it's halfway out, I\nguess you can call it either a child or a fetus. It's\nsort of half and half isn't it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could use\neither terminology, Justice Scalia. My point is,\nnothing turns on the terminology. I mean, the\nterminology that Congress chose to use is a living\nfetus. I think the point, though, is that when fetal\ndemise is induced in utero, whatever else you think\nabout that procedure that is classically an abortion, as\nit has been always understood. But when fetal demise is\ninduced when the, when the living fetus is over halfway\noutside of the womb, then I think Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't the fetus be -- I\nthink it suffer a demise in seconds anyway.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well it may be seconds, it\nmay be hours; it depends on -- because even a pre --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you not agree that it\nhas no chance of survival, in most cases?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If we are talking about\npreviability then by definition chances are it won't\nsurvive.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, that's right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But again, I don't think\nthat, you know, that anything in this act --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Congress has made the\njudgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal\ndemise takes place before any delivery begins. That's\nthe big issue.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure if it's\nwhether, that's a fair, that's a fair summary. I mean,\nyou know, the line isn't that fetal demise has to be\ndone before any delivery begins, but the basic point of\nthis statute is to draw a bright line between a\nprocedure that induces fetal demise in utero and one\nwhere the lethal act occurs when the child or the fetus,\nwhichever you want to call it, is more than halfway\noutside of the mother's womb.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it, would it be\nlawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus\nentirely and just let it expire without any attempt to\nkeep it alive?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, in the\npostviability context it would clearly be, it would\nclearly be infanticide. I think in the previability\ncontext, if you have a complete delivery but the child\nisn't going to survive, I don't think it would be\ninfanticide to necessarily let the child expire --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But I do think by contrast\nif somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know,\nperfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to\nlive, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, I\nthink we'd call that murder, and in fact Congress passed\nanother statute --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, that's\nnot what this case is about, because I think you have\nrecognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking\nabout whether any fetus will be preserved by this\nlegislation. The only question that you are raising is\nwhether Congress can ban a certain method of performing\nan abortion. So anything about infanticide, babies, all\nthat, is just beside the point because what this bans is\na method of abortion. It doesn't preserve any fetus\nbecause you just do it inside the womb instead of\noutside.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Ginsberg, that's\nright, but I don't think that's to trivialize Congress's\ninterest in maintaining a bright line between abortion\nand infanticide. And the way I would illustrate it is\nthat line, even if you might think it has a temporal\nline, in the sense that viability versus previability is\nrelevant, it clearly has a spatial dimension as well and\nthe best illustration of that I think is think about a\nlawful postviability abortion. There is a problem with\nthe mother's health, there is a problem with her life so\nit's a lawful postviability abortion. I don't think\nanybody thinks that the law is or should be\nindifferent to whether in that case fetal demise takes\nplace in utero or outside the mother's womb. The one is\nabortion, the other is murder.\nAnd I think that just recognizes that even\nin the postviability context you have a very important\nline which is a spatial line, and that line is basically\nin womb, outside of womb, and what Congress tried to do\nin this statute is to draw that line and differentiate\nbetween one procedure where fetal demise takes place in\nutero --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if this case were\nlimited to postviability abortions it would be a\ndifferent matter. But isn't it so that the vast\nmajority of these abortions are going to be performed\npreviability?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's probably\nright, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the point I would\nmake is that Congress has an interest in maintaining the\nspatial line between infanticide and abortion, even with\nrespect to previability fetuses and that's true for at\nleast two reasons.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- I see what you're\ndriving at in terms of the procedure. We are focusing\non a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no\nmatter what, right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we are not\ntalking about anyone being born and living. They are\nnot going to.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with the caveat that\nthe statute does apply both --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's the area of\nfocus.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, Congress has said that --\nthe doctor, you can achieve that result through method A,\nbut not through method B, and you're saying Congress had\ngood reason for doing that. I take it Congress also\nagrees that if method B, which they don't want, were to\nbe necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the\nConstitution would require it being done. I didn't see\nanything here about Congress disagreeing with that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, I think that's right,\nJustice Breyer. I think this, Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's\nright --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- took this Court's\nStenberg's decision as a given --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Fine. Okay. They\nmake a finding that although we don't disagree with\nthat, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health\nor safety of the mother. That's where we are. Now as I\nlook at the record, I see many, many, many doctors\ntelling Congress and everybody else that it is\nnecessary, and safe. And I see other doctors telling\nCongress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't\nnecessary, ever for safety.\nAnd so if medical opinion is divided, and\nI'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to\nknow your reaction. If medical opinion is divided, why\nwouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say\nthis use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to\npermit its use but only where appropriate medical\nopinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of\nthe mother?\nNow, if Congress is right, there will be no\nsuch case so it's no problem. But if Congress is wrong,\nthen the doctor will be able to perform the procedure\nand Congress couldn't object to that because the\nCongress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then\nCongress was wrong. They agreed that we had a health or\nsafety exception.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nBreyer, here is the problem with that way of approaching\nthe statute. That might be a permissible way of\napproaching it if what the evidence on the other side\nwas, that well you know there are cause-specific reasons\nwhy you need this procedure. There are particular\nconditions where you need this procedure. But that's\nnot the evidence on the other side. What their doctors\nsay, the doctors who perform this D&X procedure, the\nDr. Chasens, the Dr. Fredericksons, what they will tell\nyou is that every single case the D&X procedure is\nbetter and safer and they want to do it. And so it\ndoesn't make, I mean Congress can't pass a statute that\nbans procedure A, and that ban doesn't apply any time a\ndoctor prefers procedure A.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. It just wouldn't be a\nquestion of the doctor's preference. You would have to\nrefer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk\nabout including Stenberg is not that that the doctor\nsimply has a preference, but rather that there has to be\na significant body of medical opinion that says that\nthis is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of\nthe mother.\nNow, where that's true, the Court has\npreviously said that the Constitution protects the\nright. And I don't see anything in what Congress says\nthat wants to change that law. They simply have a\ndifferent view of the facts.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, they do have a\ndifferent view of the facts. And I guess the question\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if they have a different\nview of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever\nfacts develop? If there is an appropriate body of\nmedical opinion that does in fact believe this is\nnecessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and\nthe abortion could be performed and the injunction would\nsay that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And otherwise not.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If this Court rejects the\nfacial challenge to this statute it is still going to be\nopen for litigants in the future to try to identify\nspecific conditions where this procedure is the safer\nalternative.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me a\nhypothetical instance in which where an as applied\nchallenge could be brought if we sustain the statutue\non its face? The procedure has to take place within 24,\n48, 72 hours. How would as applied challenge take place?\nYou know, I read all the doctors' testimony\nin this case, hundreds of pages, and I'm familiar with\nthe area generally. But it takes a while to get up to\nspeed. I don't know if you could just go to a district\njudge and say I need an order, the judge would take --\nwould have to take many hours to understand that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, what I\nthink I have in mind principally would be a\npreenforcement challenge that was an as applied\nchallenge. And what I have in mind, you know that's\nsomething that there is in other areas of the law,\nSteffl against Thompson is an example. But what you\nwould have in mind is a doctor who had standing under\nthis Court's abortion jurisprudence would come in and\nsay, look, in my practice I've seen that this procedure\nwould be particularly useful in dealing with\npreeclampsia or placental previa or some condition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that already in\nthe record in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit\nand in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts,\nproceedings in those circuits?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, there is an effort\nto make that showing. I don't think that it's been a\nsuccessful effort to make that showing. In fact I think\nif you look at the findings of the district courts in\nthese cases, two of the three district courts found that\nthere was no particular condition where the D&X abortion\nwas medically necessary or had marginal safe benefits --\nsafety benefits. In this case, the Nebraska case, the\ndistrict court identified only two conditions,\npreeclampsia combined with maternal cancer, and placenta\nprevia. And as to those particular findings as we point\nout in our reply brief, there are problems with each of\nthose findings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: General Clement, I'm just\nthinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge\nwould be really much different from what we have seen\nalready.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think, I\nmean, they've challenged everything including every\napplication of the statute and they've tried to pick off\nsome particular conditions. What I'm imagining is in\nthe future you might have, you might have additional\nevidence, you might have additional experience with\ndoctors, and they might come in and target their\nchallenge to particular conditions and try to say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But General -- General\nClement, conditions don't show up in the abstract.\nWouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the\nvulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't\nbring a preenforcement challenge as to that. Maybe\nit's a question of hemorrhaging, that -- it's a\ncombination of what the condition is and the\nvulnerability of the particular patient and I don't see\nhow that could be tested in advance.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg my\nunderstanding is even when you talk about an\nidiosyncratic condition, I mean, the doctors who perform\nthese abortions perform, you know, hundreds of them a\nyear and they can identify those conditions and they\nhave names for those conditions and I think it would be\namenable to bringing a more as applied challenge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, do you\nunderstand the scope of this statute to be different\nthan the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg,\nfocusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional\nlanguage?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I certainly do, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and I think that this statute, unlike the\nNebraska statute, clearly uses an anatomical landmark\napproach that is based in the text of the statute and\nclearly distinguishes between the D&E procedure on the\none hand and the D&X on the other hand.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't it quite\nindependent of the anatomical approach that the health\nexception is denied? I mean that's an -- that does not\ndepend on the anatomical approach. The anatomical\napproach may well be an answer at the facial\nchallenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example.\nBut the health excepton problem is not affected by that.\nAnd the difficulty that I have with your argument that\nsomehow the health exception issue should be left to an\nas applied challenge is the statement in Stenberg, and\nit's on 938.\nI'm quoting: \"But where substantial medical\nauthority supports the proposition that banning a\nparticular abortion procedure could endanger women's\nhealth, Casey requires the statute to include a health\nexception where the procedure is necessary in\nappropriate medical judgment for the preservation --\"\n-- excuse me -- \"of the life or health of the mother.\"\nNow, your position, it seems to me, requires\nus to do one of three things. Either we, we overrule\nStenberg in that respect, or we, we find -- I don't know\nhow but we might find, well, in this case, there is no\nsubstantial medical authority, and therefore on the face\nof the statute there seems to be no impediment in the\nStenberg statement. Or three, we say well, there seems\nto be a tension between the showing of substantial\nmedical authority which occurred in the litigation in\nthese cases and the findings made by Congress, and under\nthose circumstances in effect we are required to ignore\nthe record in the cases and go with Congress's\napparently contrary judgment.\nWhich of the three do we take?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, we would urge you to\ntake any one of them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Take all three.\n(Laughter.)\nJUDGE SOUTER: No, but seriously --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But in fairness, I mean,\nyou know, we have an obligation to defend the statute.\nSo our first, you know, our first effort would be to say\nwe distinguish the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but the problem, I\nguess -- focus the problem this way. The, the Stenberg\nopinion talks about substantial medical authority as\ntriggering this requirement for a statutory element.\nThat problem is not focused simply by saying Congress\nmade some findings and the district court made other\nfindings and Congress should prevail.\nThe fact is the substantial medical judgment\nfinding I would suppose is satisfied by the, by the\nrecord in the district courts in these cases. This is\nnot one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court can\nreasonably find, it seems to me, that there is\nsubstantial medical judgment. If we are going to defer,\nas you say we should defer to Congress, haven't we got\nto overrule that statement?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice\nSouter. Let me just -- I'd like to save some time for\nrebuttal, but let me try to answer it this way, which is\nour way of looking at Stenberg is Stenberg really\ndoesn't address what you do when there are congressional\nfindings. And there is some tension between Stenberg\nand Turner on this, because Stenberg seems to suggest,\nwell, when there is a doubt, the kind of doubt that\nwould normally get you past a summary judgment, you\ndefer to the doctors, and Turner seems to suggest when\nyou have a doubt, conflicting evidence, the kind of\ndoubt that might get you past summary judgment normally,\nyou defer to Congress. And it has to be one or the\nother. It can't go both ways, can't go opposite ways,\nand we would say resolve that tension, but when there is\ncongressional findings, something that you obviously\ndidn't have to confront in Stenberg, defer to the\ncongressional approach.\nIf Stenberg means something contrary, that\neven in the face of congressional findings that you have\nto defer to a minority opinion of doctors and, you know,\nkind of invert what would normally be the way of\napproaching it, we think then that would be inconsistent\nwith this Court's decision in Casey, among others, and\nyou should revisit Stenberg to that effect, to that\nextent.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMiss Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRISCILLA SMITH\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Government throughout this case has\nquarreled with the plaintiff's statement of Stenberg and\nCongress quarreled clearly with the district court\nfindings, but their real argument here is with this\nCourt in the Court's ruling in Stenberg, particularly in\nlight of the congressional findings that are, that are\nfrankly unsupported by either the congressional record\nor the additional evidence presented to the district\ncourts. The only course here that preserves the\nindependence of the judiciary, that exemplifies the\nimportance of stare decisis, not to mention the only\ncourse that will protect women from needless risks of\nuterine perforation, infertility, sepsis and hemorrhage,\nis to hold this act unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me -- I\ndidn't find it in the materials. Maybe the statistics\naren't available. In the cases where intact D&E or D&X\nare performed in the period I guess, what, 16 through\n20, 21st, 22nd weeks, in how many of those instances, do\nyou have any idea, in how many of those instances is\nthere serious health risk to the mother that requires\nthe procedure as opposed to simply being an elective\nprocedure? Are there any statistics on that?\nMS. SMITH: No. In terms of the underlying\nmedical conditions there really aren't, Your Honor, and\nit varies dramatically according to the practice of the\nphysician. If a physician is in a high risk OBGYN\npractice, he or she is much more likely to encounter\npatients with serious underlying medical conditions such\nas the ones that the doctors have testified about in\nthis case, the liver disease, kidney disease, heart,\ncardiovascular disease, cancer of the placenta, bleeding\nplacenta previa, all of these issues and underlying\nconditions that makes the impact and the risks that are\nreduced by the intact D&E particularly important.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have no evidence\neither in the record before the Court or Congress as to\nhow often that situation arises?\nMS. SMITH: No, we don't, Your Honor. We\nknow that in some practices it's quite frequent, in some\npractices it's not as frequent because those are mostly\nhospital-based practices. But on the other hand,\nthere's extensive evidence in this case, much more\nevidence frankly, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, than there\nwas in the Stenberg case, of the, of the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just one other\nquestion that, it's generally related to the first.\nIf there is substantial evidence that other procedures\nor alternate procedures are available, alternate to D&X,\nalternate to intact D&E, is your response that, although\nthey're available as a matter of science, as a matter of,\nof medical expertise, they are not available because\nhospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted? I\nwas going to ask that same question to the Government,\nbecause there is some indication in the record that\ncertain hospitals just don't admit patients for this\npurpose, which is -- goes back to my earlier question.\nI was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.\nMS. SMITH: Because it's what sir?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's purely\nelective and not medically necessary.\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. Hospitals,\nmany, many hospitals throughout the United States refuse\nto provide any abortions whatsoever as just a blanket\nrule. There are some that will provide abortions in\ncertain, in certain circumstances where the woman is\nobtaining the abortion because of a certain medical\ncondition. Then there are women who are obtaining an\nabortion because they have chosen that that's the best\ncourse for them who also have underlying medical\nconditions. So if you're a woman who has chosen to\nobtain an abortion and you have an underlying cardiac\ndisease, for example -- we had a case like this in\nLouisiana. The hospital refused to do the abortion\nbecause her chance of dying from the underlying medical\ncondition was not over 50 percent. So the availability\nof hospital services is somewhat unrelated to this case,\nbut it is, it is quite limited in some circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might be related\nin the sense that the Government's argument that there\nare alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative.\nI was going to ask the Government about that. On the\nother hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't\nallow the procedure is also indicated, indication that\nthere is a medical opinion against it.\nMS. SMITH: No, not at all, Your Honor. The\nmedical opinion in those cases is against abortion\nwhatsoever and a refusal to use one's facilities to\nprovide any abortion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in terms of --\nMS. SMITH: -- of any kind, not about any\nparticular procedure.\nI'm sorry, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't like your\ncharacterization and the Government's of the state of\nthe record. I asked my law clerk basically to go look\nup every statement that was made in four forums. The\nfirst was the first Stenberg case. Second was Congress.\nThird is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is\nthe other case here. Now, my own impression of that is\nif you're talking about the medical need for such a\ncase, that is for intact D&E, that there is a risk\nattached if you don't use it in some instances. The\nfewest number of statements for that proposition was in\nthe first Stenberg.\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: More statements in\nCongress, more statements that you -- doctors who say, I\nneed this procedure for safety.\nMS. SMITH: There are many more in this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are many more in this\ncase than there were -- in these two cases there are\nmany more than there were in Congress and in Congress\nthere are many more than they were in first Stenberg.\nMS. SMITH: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, if we look to the\nother side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it\nisn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably\nmany more in Congress than there are -- who say it isn't\nsafe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then\nthere are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly\nany in Stenberg, not too many.\nMS. SMITH: Well, there is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was against you, in\nother words.\nMS. SMITH: There are many letters written\nto Congress that are in the record. In terms of live\nwitnesses, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. SMITH: -- there were in Congress eight\nlive witnesses that testified.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, so I'm left with\na record where I guess you have a subjective\ncharacterization that there is at least as much evidence\nin these cases supporting you and as much in Congress\nsupporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case.\nBut Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with\nthe finding?\nMS. SMITH: Right. Well, the important\npoint, Your Honor, is that even if the Court applied the\nhighest level of deference under Turner, the findings\nwould be rejected and must be rejected, as all three\ndistrict courts held, because they're simply\nunreasonable even under a Turner standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Smith, was the\nstatement of the American College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists before Congress?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, it was, as was\nthe brief that was filed, the amicus brief that was\nfiled in this case in Stenberg was before Congress, and\nalso testimony from numerous physicians in the form of\nletter. In terms of live witnesses, there were simply\nnot that many.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you an\nextra 30 seconds. Proceed.\nMS. SMITH: That's fine, Your Honor. I've\nlost track of my train of thought, though, I think.\nI think what I was saying was there were\neight witnesses who testified live.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question basically I\nthink you might have been going after is, I was saying\nthat I agreed with you in that there is more evidence\nsupporting your side in these cases than there was\nbefore Congress, than there was in first Stenberg.\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But still there was a\nfinding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the\nNebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the\nfinding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska\nlegislature -- what kind of legal difference does that\nmake?\nMS. SMITH: And Your Honor, what I would say\nin this case, it makes none. While it's an extremely\ninteresting academic question about the level of\ndeference that should be applied in this kind of\ncircumstance, here it really is academic because under,\neven under the Turner standard, if applied in a way that\nTurner actually applied deference, to carefully review\nthe findings in light of the evidence in Congress and\nagain in light of the evidence in the district court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion about what you think we should do. If I\nthought the evidence did support the conclusion that\nit's never medically necessary, it merely -- the\nevidence merely supports the proposition that a doctor\nhas to be a lot more careful if he goes one way rather\nthan the other because there are more risks involved in\none procedure rather than the other, would that be\nsufficient to support the -- I can see the argument that\nthe intact delivery may have less risk of complications\nand so forth without it not necessarily being absolutely\nnecessary.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think there is, there's\nbeen some confusion about the word \"necessary\" and it's\nbeen used sometimes to talk about whether there are\nother procedures that could be used, as opposed to the\ndetermination that it is the safest procedure that\nreduces significantly the risk of very serious\ncomplications, not the risks of minor complications.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess that gets\nback to the point earlier. I mean, do you agree with\nthe discussion earlier that this act is not going to\nprevent abortions?\nMS. SMITH: No, not at all, Your Honor. I\n-- the issue of the scope and breadth of the law is -- I\nthink the evidence clearly shows that this is a very\nbroad law that applies to D&E abortions and, contrary to\nwhat the Solicitor General said about the intent of\nabortions, abortion providers like Dr. Vibhakar and\nothers, they actually, their intent is always to remove\nthe fetus as intact as possible, and the district courts\nhave recognized that as an intent that's covered under\nthe terms of the act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What degree of\nmarginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to\noverride the State's interest? I mean, if you have\ncomplications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent\nof the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of\nthe cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to\noverride the State's articulated interest?\nMS. SMITH: I don't believe a marginal\nbenefit in safety is enough and I don't believe that's\nwhat we have here. The testimony from over, from at\nleast 11 board-certified OBGYNs, from the American\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that the\nreduction in risk is significant and that it reduces the\nrisk of serious complications, such as uterine\nperforation, which can lead to hysterectomy and\ninfertility.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought your\nsubmission earlier was that we don't have any record\nevidence about how often the complications arise, so\nit's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference\nis in terms of safety under your submission.\nMS. SMITH: We don't have a quantification\nof the safety. What we what we have is the clinical\nexperience of major leading physicians in the field,\nwho've testified that they've used both procedures. In\nfact, many of them have testified that they perforated\nuteruses in non-intact D&Es and they've never perforated\na uterus in an intact D&E. And that in fact is borne\nout by the Chasen study, a very small study with very\nsmall numbers, but it shows all the serious\ncomplications are in the non-intact group.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we could go back to\nthe first question that the Chief asked you, you said\nyes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain\nline between the D&X and the D&E. Is there a way that\nCongress could have written the statute that would have\ninsulated the physician who's performing a D&E?\nMS. SMITH: Absolutely, Your Honor. I think\nthat the blueprint that this Court laid out, that\ncertainly is suggested in Justice O'Connor's concurrence\nin Stenberg, was rejected by Congress. She references\nthree statutes, that if they had included a health\nexception, she thinks would have been constitutional.\nThey all include the word intact.\nI think there's another narrower\nconstruction of the act too that is possible. Adding in\nthe word intact, reading in the word intact, it seems to\nme, is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute as\nit is, but certainly Congress could have done that and\nother States have done it, but Congress set out not to\ndo that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to focus on\none particular problem that I think is implicated by\nJustice Ginsburg's question. If I understood you\ncorrectly a moment ago, and I think this is in your\nbriefs too, you said that the definitional problem is\nthat doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if\nthey can, because it involves less risk to the mother\nfrom, from acts performed inside. And if that's the\ncase, then it would be, I guess in the real world, very\ndifficult for Congress to define a difference between\nD&E and D&X, because the intention is always, as you\nunderstand it, to have an intact result.\nYour brother on the other side, the\nSolicitor General says there certainly is testimony to\nthe effect that that is not so. That doctors who intend\nto perform a D&E simply intend at the beginning to have\na lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do\nthe D&E and not have a totally intact procedure.\nWould you comment on what I think is the\nfactual difference between you and the Solicitor General\nthere?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nproblem with the law is that because it's not limited to\nintact, it would in fact cover the procedures that are\nperformed by physicians who intend to perform a\nprocedure as intact as possible but simply don't expect\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that.\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But could you start simply\nwith the factual predicate for your argument and his\nargument. You seem to be starting from, if I understand\nthe two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from\nbasically different factual assumptions. Could you,\ncould you start by commenting on that?\nMS. SMITH: Yes. The doctors perform the\nsame dilation protocols whether they are going to\nperform a D&E or an intact D&E, and that's true for\nDr. Chasen and Dr. Westhoff, who performed both intact\nand non-intact procedures.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the\nevidence was that you're looking for a different degree\nof dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if\n-- and you're looking for a greater degree if you're\nintending to perform a D&X.\nMS. SMITH: It doesn't play out that way.\nDoctors do have different dilation protocols, but they\nare often looking for as much dilation as they can get.\nOn the other hand --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your submission\nthat there aren't different dilation protocols if you're\nintending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're\nthe same?\nMS. SMITH: It varies by doctor. For\nexample, Dr. Carhart uses the same dilation protocol\nwhether he's going to do an intact or a non-intact.\nOther doctors might try to do more dilation. And the\ndoctors, importantly, can't control the amount of\ndilation they get, so a decision happens.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they may not be able\nto control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go\nabout it in a way that would tend to produce less rather\nthan more dilation?\nMS. SMITH: Not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It can't guarantee results,\nbut couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know\nhow you put it, a procedure that would be likely to\nproduce less rather than more, and hence come within the\nsafe harbor, if you will, of the statute?\nMS. SMITH: Well, they are always looking\nfor a minimal amount of dilation. Then people who chose\nto do another day of dilation, for example, that could\nadd additional dilation. But for the first day of\ndilation, no, Your Honor. They don't seek more or less\nover one day. They might do a second day or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say they don't,\nbut my question is, can they? And the record may not\nshow this. I'm not asking you to answer the impossible,\nbut do we have evidence that would indicate that they\ncan or that they can't?\nMS. SMITH: Not in the first day of\ndilation, no. They can't control how much dilation is\ngoing to occur. They need a minimal amount and they are\nnot going to shoot for less than that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can you tell us where to\nlook in the record for the evidence on that?\nMS. SMITH: Each doctor testifies about\ntheir own dilation protocols, Your Honor, and I believe\nthat's in the Eighth Circuit appendix. Those -- those\n-- portions of that testimony, and are cited more\nspecifically in the Eighth Circuit briefs, which goes\nmore into the factual detail, Your Honor, but I don't\nhave the cites right now. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If there were a health\nexception --\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The health of the woman,\nwould that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth\nproblems that you bring up? Because then after we say\nto the doctor, you put the health of your patients first\nand if you think that it's riskier for her health to do\nit one way than another way, then you pick the safer way.\nIf you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about\noverbreadth fade?\nMS. SMITH: Not if this is not limited to\nintact, Your Honor, because then you would be limiting\nD&E abortions, which is 95 percent of all abortions, to\ncircumstances where the doctor could prove that it was\nin fact the safest procedure. And we've had doctors\ntestify in trial, for example, that they refused to\ndescribe even intact -- regular D&Es to their patients\nbecause they believe induction is always safer. So\nthose doctors, I think would still be at risk, and it\nwould put 95 percent of second trimester abortions at\nrisk in that case, to prosecution for performing a D&E\nwhen you should have been performing an induction\nprocedure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the, on\nthe same issue I think, that the addition of the\ndeliberately and intentionally language in the\ncongressional act addresses that concern?\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor, because actually\nthat same language is in the Stenberg, the Nebraska\nstatute. It also was targeted at deliberately\nintentionally. I do think that if there is a\nconstruction that would narrow the law to a limited\namount of intact D&Es, if you read the \"for the purpose\nof\" language in the statute, to be performing an overt\nact for the sole purpose of completing delivery, then --\nor rather -- I'm sorry. For the purpose of performing\nan overt act that causes fetal demise, that does not\nfacilitate delivery of the statute -- of the fetus.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what I was\nwondering, because --\nMS. SMITH: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, this might help,\nsuppose the physician testifies that I wanted to do a\nnon-intact, an in utero D&E, that that's, that was my\nintent, that's what I wanted to do, that's what I always\nwant to do. In this case I had an intact delivery and\nhad no other choice. Are you saying that we could\ninterpret the statute to say that that is not the\nprohibited criminal intent, he is immune from\nprosecution in that case?\nMS. SMITH: No. I don't believe that's the\nline that could be drawn, Your Honor, because anyone who\ndoes a D&E is intending to remove the fetus as intact as\npossible, and always can have the intent to go to the\nanatomical landmark that's here. I'm suggesting a\ndifferent interpretation that uses the \"for the purpose\nof\" language where it says for the purpose of performing\nan overt act that the person knows will kill the\npartially delivered living fetus. If that language was\ninterpreted to be for the sole purpose of performing\nfetal demise at that point, rather than what the doctors\ndo, which is perform the action that causes fetal demise\nin order to facilitate delivery of the fetus. So if\nit's not to facilitate delivery of the fetus --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, give me one instance\nin which your proposed interpretation would work in the\nreal world.\nMS. SMITH: Well, there are allegations in\nthe Congressional Record, for example, in reference --\nin Justice Thomas' dissent by Nurse Schaffer, Dr. Pamela\nSmith, about circumstances where the physician actually\nholds the fetus in the woman's body in order to cause\nfetal demise, rather than causing fetal demise because\nit's an integral part of removal of the fetus from the\nwoman's uterus. And those circumstances would be banned\nunder that interpretation.\nBut I want to get back to the Turner point,\nif I may for a minute, the issue of deference to\ncongressional finding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just on that last\npoint, I mean, we are interested of course in different\ninterpretations, but it just seems to me that your\ninterpretation would have very little practical effect.\nMS. SMITH: Well, it would -- it would ban\ncertainly a certain type of intact procedure that was\ndiscussed, and I think is the image many people have of\n\"partial-birth abortion\" frankly, that this is something\nthat's done gratuitously, not as an integral part of\nmaking this procedure the safest for the woman, and\navoiding instrumentation and avoiding perforation and\nhysterectomies, which are serious complications that\nthough rare, when they occur, they are catastrophic and\nlife changing and disastrous. So the numbers are not\nhigh of any complications, but the complications when\nthey occur are, are devastating. And this is what the\ndoctors are experiencing when they perform intact D&Es,\nthat they are not having these types of complications.\nSo -- if I can move to the deference point,\nI would like to talk a little bit about deference to\ncongressional findings because there is significant\nauthority from this Court of course, saying that where\nthere are danger signs of constitutional risks, as the\nCourt recently said in Randall versus Sorrell, that the\nCourt must independently and carefully review\ncongressional findings. And the Court has rejected\nfindings that attempted to change either by findings of\nfact or legal findings, that attempted to change a\nconstitutional standard.\nBut in any case, the findings in this case\nare simply unreasonable and not supported by the\nevidence. If you go to the findings themselves, the\nultimate finding in 14o, which claims that it is\nactually relying on the preceding findings, it says,\n\"for these reasons, Congress finds that partial birth\nabortion is never medically indicated,\" and then you go\nbackwards and look at the reasons. The reasons are the\nfindings that are not defended by the Government, that\nwere not defended by the Government witnesses and that\nare blatantly false, except for perhaps one of them.\nThere are findings of, that partial-birth\nabortion poses serious risks. The Government witnesses\nagreed that this was not true.\nTheir findings that partial-birth abortion\nis not taught in medical schools. Of course, we know\nthat is simply not true, it's an integral part of\nabortion training at major medical institutions like\nCornell, Columbia, Yale, NYU, Northwestern, etc.\nIt says that abortion, partial-birth\nabortion is a disfavored practice among abortion\nproviders. That is absolutely not true.\nAnd it says that there are no comparative\nstudies. We know now that is not true because the\nChasen study has come out, and is the first study of its\nkind to try to evaluate the differences between intact\nand non-intact. It is still true that there are no\ncontrolled studies, there is no randomized clinical\ntrial, but if that were the standard, no new and safer\nabortion procedures could ever be developed.\nTurning back, Your Honors, to the health issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask you just\none thing?\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute, of\ncourse, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries.\nHow common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?\nMS. SMITH: Not very common. Not very\ncommon, Your Honor. It would occur in circumstances\nwhere there is a significant fetal anomaly and some kind\nof a, something called a sides, or another type of fetal\nanomaly where there is a distension of the abdomen, but\nit's very rare.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in giving your\narguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I\ncouldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the\ntotal delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery\nsituation.\nMS. SMITH: I'm sorry. I don't know if I\nunderstand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my\nunderstanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are\nalready outside the mother.\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the objection in\nthe feet first is that you want fewer instrument\npasses and so on.\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in that case,\nit's not the skull itself that is preventing the\ndelivery of the fetus.\nMS. SMITH: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your arguments\nabout why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't\nthat apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as\nwell? In other words, if you want as much of the fetus\nintact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway?\nWouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the\nfetus?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, but these are circumstances\nwhere the fetus can't be delivered. That's the point,\nYour Honor, is that the fetus is obstructed and so the\novert act that takes place is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the case of a\nvertex delivery, where is the obstruction?\nMS. SMITH: The obstruction would come from\na distension of the abdomen, usually from a significant\nfetal anomaly like a sides, which is, this is a serious\nanomaly. It's lethal anomalies that I was talking\nabout. And in those circumstances, an overt act would\nneed to be performed that would in fact cause fetal\ndemise before the fetus could be, the delivery could be\ncontinued.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that your\nargument is that there is always a constitutional right\nto use what the physician thinks is the safest\nprocedure.\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. I think the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I inferred that from your\ncomments.\nMS. SMITH: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nWhat, what the Court held in Stenberg in applying the\nappropriate medical judgment standard of Casey, was that\nthere had to be a substantial body of medical opinion,\nan objective standard that in fact supports the use of\nthat procedure. And that both, that balances concerns\nagainst protecting a woman's health with a concern of\nunfettered discretion, which the Court has rejected.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then, you think there\nare instances in which the State can require that a\nprocedure be used, even if it's not the safest\nprocedure?\nMS. SMITH: I'm sorry. I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then, the --\nMS. SMITH: Yeah.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The obverse of the\nproposition I put at first, it must be true that there\nare some instances in which the State can prohibit a\nprocedure even if it is the safest procedure.\nMS. SMITH: That's true, Your Honor, as long\nas it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which\nas you know, certainly the circumstance with the D&E,\nwhich is 95 percent of abortions, under the Stenberg\nruling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I just follow up\non that?\nMS. SMITH: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nthat. In other words, the fact that it's not the safest\nprocedure does not itself constitute an undue burden?\nIn other words, under Justice Kennedy's hypothetical --\nMS. SMITH: I don't understand what you\nmean.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He said that the\nState can prohibit something even if it is the safest\nprocedure, and your answer was so long as it doesn't --\nMS. SMITH: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- pose an undue\nburden. And I was just following up to say that so, in\nsome circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the\nsafest procedure does not itself constitute an undue\nburden.\nMS. SMITH: No. I understood Justice\nKennedy's question to be, could the State prohibit what\nit thinks is not the safest. And under the Stenberg\nruling, although the Court hasn't addressed that\nquestion directly, under Stenberg what the Court has\nsaid is, the Court can ban procedures only where there\nis not significant medical authority supporting their\nuse as the safest procedure in some circumstances. So\nperhaps I misunderstood your question.\nBut the Court has not ever addressed the\nquestion, can we ban a procedure that's not the safest.\nI think the ruling in Stenberg would say well, there has\nto be significant medical authority that in some\ncircumstances it is the safest. The alternative\nargument would be, but, if it is the procedure that's\nused in 95 percent of the cases, or a vast majority of\nthe cases, and banning it would thereby deny women the\nright to get an abortion and be a substantial obstacle\nin their path in obtaining a legal abortion, that would\nbe another reason why you couldn't ban it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMiss Smith.\nMS. SMITH: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement, you\nhave two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me make just a couple of points in rebuttal.\nI'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's\nquestion, about whether or not there are going to be\nalternative methods available to end the pregnancy as a\npractical matter. And the answer to that is there will\nalways be an alternative available as a practical matter.\nThe alternative will always be the D&E procedure, which\nthe district court in this case called the gold standard.\nAnd the best evidence of that, Justice Kennedy, is that\ntheir own witnesses like Dr. Chasen, for example, when\nthey set out to perform the D&X procedure, they are only\nsuccessful about 33 percent of the time. What happens\nin the other 67 percent of the cases is they actually,\neven though they tried to perform a D&X, will perform a\nD&E. And so all of the clinics that provide D&X also\nnecessarily provide D&E, because the D&E is what they\nend up with if they are not able to remove the fetus\nintact. So in every single case, there are some, you\nknow, the induction procedure has to be done in a\nhospital, but the D&X and D&E procedures are both\nequally available in clinics, so no woman as either a\ntheoretical matter or a practical matter, is going to be\ndenied a safe alternative to end her pregnancy.\nI wanted to pick up on Justice Souter's\nquestion as well. You asked for factual citations in\nthe record on this dispute between us. I think the\nrecord is really overwhelmingly in our favor. I point\nyou to Dr. Fitzhugh, who's one of the plaintiffs on this\nside, 135a. He says he doesn't try for intact delivery\nin every case because it would necessitate a second\nround of dilation, a second round of laminarias, so he\ndoesn't do the second round, he gets dismemberment.\nDr. Knorr, another one of the plaintiffs, at page 142a,\nhe says the procedure would require greater dilation.\nAnd if I could just finish on the citations,\nDr. Vibhakar, who does dismemberment 100 percent of the\ntime, 148a -- all of these are in the petition appendix\nof the district court opinion -- Dr. Cranen explains his\nprocedure at 174a to 177a. Thank you\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
