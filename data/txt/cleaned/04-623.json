CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nBefore Oregon became the first State to\nauthorize assisted suicide, the prescription of federally\ncontrolled substances to facilitate suicide generally\nviolated State law and also violated Federal law.\nRespondents contend that Oregon's decision to remove the\nState-law consequences from that conduct also operated to\nremove the Federal-law consequences.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, what Federal law\ndoes it violate?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It violated the Controlled\nSubstances Act. And the D.A. had taken the position,\nbefore Oregon acted, for example, that the fact that a\ndoctor prescribed controlled substances for purposes of a\nsuicide was a basis for revoking his license.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, would that be true\nalso for any doctor who provided the substances to furnish\nan execution of a convicted death penalty convict?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice O'Connor, the\ndeath penalty situation, lethal injection, is different,\nfor a number of reasons. Of course, the D.A. has long\ntaken a position of non-enforcement in that context, which\nwould be protected by this Court's decision in Heckler\nagainst Cheney.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But, otherwise, it would be\nthe same reasoning --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think it would,\nJustice O'Connor, at least not since 1994, because in 1994\nCongress passed a statute that I think is best read as\nratifying the practice of lethal injection. This is 18\nU.S.C. 3596. And that statute authorizes the Federal\nGovernment to use the method of execution in the State of\nthe sentencing court. And at the time that was passed, in\n1994, the overwhelming majority -- something like 25 of\nthe 38 States -- had already used lethal injection. So, I\nwould read that as --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But would it be open --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- a ratification --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to the Attorney General to\npass a regulation like this one, and all of a sudden apply\nit -- some new Attorney General, who had a very different\nview of the death penalty?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think so, Justice\nO'Connor, and I think the reason is, at a minimum, 18\nU.S.C. 3596, because I think that would now stand as an\nobstacle to that type of regulatory impression --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, not if it just refers\nback to the States, would it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, but this is a provision\nthat dictates how the Federal Government shall do its\nexecutions. And I think, at that time, in 1994, it\neffectively ratified the practice of using lethal\ninjection. I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does the statute -- does the\nFederal statute specifically authorize doctors to do this?\nOr does it simply say that convicts may be executed by\nlethal injection?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the statute itself says\nthat the Federal Government shall use the method in the\nState in which the sentencing court sits, the Federal\nsentencing court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the method may simply\nbe lethal injection. And, going back to Justice\nO'Connor's question, it might still be the case that, on\nthe theory the Government is advancing this morning, it\nwould be unlawful for a doctor to engage in that, because\nthat was, in fact, not within the limits of the practice\nof medicine, the doctor was using a controlled substance\nfor something outside the practice of medicine, and hence,\nit would be illegal.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And again, Justice Souter, I\nthink the best reading is, that is now foreclosed -- that\ninterpretation would be foreclosed by Congress's action in\n1994. There are also some technical differences --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it Congress did not\nrefer specifically to -- or did not include a specific\nauthorization of doctors, so that we'd have to do a little\nconstruction to get to your point.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think we would have to do a\nlittle construction, in fairness, but I do think -- I\nmean, and there also are some differences, because, for\nexample, as I understand the practice in most States,\ndoctors actually aren't exactly involved in the specific\nprocess of administering the lethal injection. There's\nalso a technical difference, which is, with respect to\nlethal injection, it's not the federally controlled\nsubstance which is the lethal agent. It's just that\nthere's a federally controlled substance that's used to\nadminister -- to relieve pain in conjunction with a\ndifferent injection that's not -- that does not involve a\nfederally controlled substance. And that's actually the\nlethal agent. Here, of course, it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In your view, were it not for\nthe statute, the Federal statute, your view of the\nAttorney General's authority is -- leaving that statute\naside, if it weren't there -- the Attorney General, should\nwe have an Attorney General who is opposed to the death\npenalty, could, in fact, regulate or stop Federal -- State\ndeath penalties, through this same mechanism, by saying\nthat no physician can be registered insofar as he engages\nin that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I haven't\nthoroughly considered the issue, precisely because I do\nthink the '94 statute stands as an obstacle. It may be\nthat some of the differences in the way that the death\npenalty is administered, the fact that doctors aren't\ndirectly involved --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At most, it --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- would allow for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- at most, it would allow him\nto prosecute, or to move for the dis-certification of\ndoctors who engage in that practice. And if the State\nchooses to do it without doctors, it would be okay.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right. As I\nsay, I think some of the technical ways in which the\npenalty is administered could make a difference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what we're getting -- at\nleast what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably\nhave read the statute to say that the drug statute, which\nis trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and -- has\nnothing to do with the death penalty. And I would think\nthat the argument on the other side is that the statute\nhas nothing to do with assisted suicide. Congress didn't\nthink about the death penalty, and it didn't think about\nassisted suicide. It's rather like the tobacco case,\nexcept a fortiori. Now, what's your response to that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, several points, Justice\nBreyer. I think that, first of all, I would say that\nCongress did focus on suicide, if not physician-assisted\nsuicide, and I think that's an important distinction that\nI'd like to come back to. But I actually think the\ncomparison to the tobacco case is quite instructive,\nbecause there what you had is a statute in which something\nseemed like it might come within the plain terms of the\nFDCA, and yet if you took that literally, it would run\nsmack into another statutory scheme.\nAnd here, there is no other statutory scheme.\nTo the contrary, the most natural reading of the\nControlled Substances Act, I would say -- and I'll address\nit in a minute -- is that this falls within the authority\nof the Attorney General. And if you look to any\nalternative congressional indication of intent on this\ntopic, the only thing you would find is the Assisted\nSuicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which continues a\nFederal policy against assisted suicide.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I comment --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: So, in that sense, I think\nit's very different than the Brown and Williamson case.\nNow, taking, though --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- as to what Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may I ask you about the\nposition this Court took in Glucksberg? That is, everyone\non the Court in that case seemed to assume that physician-\nassisted suicide was a matter for the State, and the\nGovernment, at that time, said, \"State legislatures\nundoubtedly have the authority to create the kind of\nexception to assisted suicide fashioned by the court of\nappeals. There is every reason to believe that State\nlegislatures will address the urgent issues involved in\nthis case in a fair and impartial way.\" And then the\nGovernment added that, \"There is no indication that the\npolitical processes are malfunctioning in this area.\"\nThat was a position presented to this Court in the\nGlucksberg case by the Government.\nNow, you are rejecting that position.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I don't think so. I -- we stand by the brief in\nGlucksberg. Now, obviously in the Glucksberg case, the\nFederal law that everybody was focused on -- and, in\nfairness, the United States was focused on -- was the\nFederal Constitution. And so, that's one important\ndifference.\nAnother important difference -- and I think this\nis an important point -- is that the Federal regulation\nhere, the interpretation of the Attorney General, does not\npurport to foreclose the issue of assisted suicide --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they say --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- which is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that, in practical terms,\nthat is exactly what it does, because the only way they\ncan administer their law sensibly is by using these kinds\nof drugs, scheduled drugs.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, we don't\nhave a factual record on that question. I think it's not\nclear that that's the case, because, I mean, proponents of\nphysician-assisted suicide have identified alternative\nmethods. Perhaps the most notorious proponent of\nphysician-assisted suicide, Dr. Kevorkian, operated\nwithout a federal controlled-substance license for the\nlast six years before his conviction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, did he use --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- at the time --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- did he use a controlled\nsubstance?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: He did not. He did not, which\nis why he could do that. So, it just goes to prove that\nphysician-assisted suicide and the use of federally\ncontrolled substances for physician-assisted suicide are\nnot coextensive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that the --\nthose methods are less gentle to the patient, the methods\nthat the State of Oregon has authorized its physicians to\nprescribe. We are told, at least in some of the briefs,\nthat, from the patient's point of view, it's much less\nupsetting.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, we operate\nwithout a factual record on that point. In doing some\noutside reading, it seems that some of the other methods\nare actually disapproved, not because they're less -- more\npainful, but because it's more obvious that it's a\nsuicide, in certain cases, and the administration of\nscheduled drugs sort of blurs that line.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But I guess my point would be,\neven if we take it as true that controlled substances are\nthe most efficient way to do this, I take it as a given\nthat if Oregon doctors decided that a schedule 1 substance\nwas the most effective way to administer a lethal overdose\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- after this Court's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Congress spoke --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- decision in Raich --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Congress spoke about\nsection -- schedule 1 drugs, and that's what's lacking\nhere. Congress says schedule 1 drugs, those are: no,\nnever; schedule 2: okay on a doctor's prescription.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I agree there is that\ndifference between schedule 1 and schedule 2 substances.\nNow, I think that brings us to the Attorney General's\nregulation, which is a longstanding regulation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, before you go\nthere, I want to question you about your distinction\nbetween Dr. Kevorkian and a doctor who uses controlled\nsubstances. Why could not the Attorney General treat Dr.\nKevorkian's conduct as conduct that may threaten the\npublic health and safety, and seek his -- cancellation of\nhis license?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I don't think\nhe could. First of all, I think it's clear that that\nisn't the authority that's invoked here. And the Attorney\nGeneral in the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- OLC opinion are patently --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- he can rely --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- clear on that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- on things like prior\nconvictions, other things unrelated to a specific\ntransaction. And if he thinks that assisted suicide is\ncontrary conduct that threatens the public interest,\nhealth and safety, I don't know why that wouldn't apply to\nDr. Kevorkian, as well as somebody using controlled\nsubstances.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, the\nreason I would say that it wouldn't is, I think you have\nto read this regulation against a backdrop that for 90\nyears the Federal Government has been involved in the\nregulation of controlled substance. Now, there have been\na lot of statements and a lot of court opinions during\nthat 90 years --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the Attorney General's\ndirective, if I remember it, does not identify any\nparticular controlled substance. It just identified a\nparticular kind of conduct by the doctor.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The -- I'm not sure if you're\nreferring to the statute or the regulation. I would say\nit this way, which is to say --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Neither one. Neither one is\nidentifying which schedule 2 or schedule 3 substance may\nnot be used.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's fair, Justice\nStevens. I don't take issue with that. And I think\nyou're right to say that the statutory grant of authority\nto the Attorney General is quite broad. He's supposed to\nmake judgments in the public interest about public health\nand safety.\nThe point I was trying to make is, I would read\nall of that against the backdrop that for 90 years the\nFederal Government has been involved in the regulation of\ncontrolled substance. And we all know that that is going\nto have an incidental effect on State regulation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, for me --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- of medicine.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for me, the case turns on\nthe statute. And it's a hard case. And it seems to me\nthat your answer to Justice Stevens would be to say that\nthe Justice Department has found this practice to be an\nabuse of the drug. But then, my question -- and if -- if\nyou had, in fact, given that answer, my question --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- my question would then be,\nIsn't that an odd statutory scheme, where the Attorney\nGeneral can find it to be an abuse of the use of the drug\nif the State of Oregon has specifically told its doctors,\nunder special procedures in defined circumstances, that\nthey can administer it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think that would\nbe an odd regime. I think if, for example, Oregon made a\nradically different judgment and said that in Oregon it\nwas going to be permissible to have treatment or\ndetoxification programs that involve the administration of\nradically larger quantities of controlled substances than\nhad been recognized in any other State, I think, under the\nauthority of cases like Moore, the Attorney General can\nmake a judgment -- now, that's not a legitimate medical\npurpose, that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- an abuse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's -- that's a -- the\nslipper-slope argument that I wanted to explore a bit. If\nwe do rule against you, and for the State of Oregon, on\nthe statute, you do think that there will be some other\nserious consequence which will hinder the Department of\nJustice in an orderly implementation of this statute,\nparticularly under the abuse formulation?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think there could be,\nJustice Kennedy. I don't want to overstate it, in the\nsense that -- one of the reasons you don't see that much\nof a conflict between Federal and State law in the\nregulation of controlled substances is because, in the\nmain, the States have adopted uniform controlled-\nsubstances acts that mirror the Federal Act, and, in most\nof the instances there, works in the way of cooperative\nfederalism in dealing with this problem. This Court tends\nto see the cases -- Raich, in this case -- where there's a\nconflict between the State regime and the Federal regime.\nAnd I guess my point is the -- in a such a\ncomprehensive Federal regime, if this Court makes clear\nthat State law can overtake the Federal regime, I think it\nat least creates the potential for there to be a lot of\nholes in the regime and the possibility, if States take\nthe -- take you up on that invitation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But part --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to really undermine the\nregime.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- part of the regime referred\nto under the statute -- and it's 801(a) implementing the\nconvention on psychotropic drugs -- and there, the\nimplementation incorporates the treaty -- but it says\nthat, \"This shall not displace the judgment of the medical\ncommunity, as determined by the Secretary.\" And it seems\nto me that that cuts against you in this case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, it is\nperfectly true that there are places in the statute where\nmedical or scientific decisions are expressly given to the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services and not the\nAttorney General, but it is equally true that there are\nplaces in the Controlled Substances Act where medical\ndeterminations or public-health determinations are given\nexpressly to the Attorney General and not the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services. And one of the places, of\ncourse, that's true is Sections 823 and 824 of Title 1 --\nTitle 21 -- which, of course, are the provisions about the\nregistration and revocation of registrants. And Congress\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, certainly the practice\nof medicine by physicians is an area traditionally\nregulated by the States, is it not?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It absolutely is, Justice\nO'Connor, but --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And there is nothing express\nin the statute suggesting that it's designed to put in the\nhands of the Federal Government or the Attorney General\nthe regulation of the practice of medicine, is there?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, there's\nnothing that says we want to take over the regulation of\nmedicine, but it's crystal clear --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, and there were two\nattempts, were there not, to get legislation passed to do\nthis expressly in Congress, and they failed?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, yes, but I think this\nCourt is always hesitant to draw inferences from --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- failed legislative efforts.\nAnd if --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- the Attorney General had\nnot adopted this interpretation, it may be that this\nCongress would have passed those initiatives --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And a prior Attorney General\nhad a different interpretation.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And the prior administer of\nthe DEA before that had our position. So, this is an area\nwhere I think, you know, there are different approaches to\nthis.\nWhat I wanted to make clear, though, is, you're\nabsolutely right that the regulation of medicine is --\nthis Court has observed -- is traditionally left to the\nStates. But that has to be reconciled with the fact that\nfor 90 years the Federal Government has had a prominent\nrole in the regulation of controlled substances. And it's\nbeen clear --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah, but --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- since the very --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- are these -- are these\ndrugs classified as illegal, for all purposes?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not for all --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- purposes, but they are\nhighly classified, highly controlled substances. They are\nthe -- the substances that are at issue here are the most\nhighly controlled lawful substances. And I think if you\ngo back to the history of the Harrison Act, it's been\nclear since the very first prosecutions under the Harrison\nNarcotics Act of 1914 that the Federal Government's\nability to regulate medicine was going to have an\nincidental effect on the State's ability to regulate\nmedicine. I mean, States had much more of a laissez\nattitude towards -- laissez-faire attitude towards the\nopium trade, but that was really displaced by the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah, but it's a --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- Harrison Act.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- it's a different thing to\nregulate by saying, \"No one can prescribe this substance.\nIt's so lethal, we won't let anyone prescribe it at all.\"\nAnd it's quite different to say, \"This -- if a -- if a\nphysician follows the Oregon law, it's a -- it's not a\nlegitimate practice of medicine.\" That's a very different\napproach.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, I can't tell\nyou there isn't a difference between the treatment of\nschedule 1 substances --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- that are just verboten for\nall purposes and schedule 2 substances, but the regulation\nof Federal controlled substances in the Harrison Act has\nalways focused on drugs that have some lawful medical uses\nbut are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- also susceptible to abuse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- what is the closest\nanalog you have, outside of the present case, where the\nAttorney General's enforcement activity has impinged upon\nwhat the State has recognized as medical practice?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think I would -- I\nmean, I -- I guess I would do two answers to that, Mr.\nChief Justice. One, I would point to the fact that, at\nthe genesis of the Harrison Act, it really was displacing\nState medical judgments about the opium trade. I would\npoint to two other examples, one under this statute and\none other the -- under the FDCA.\nThe idea under the FDCA -- the example that\ncomes to mind is the FDA's treatment of Laetrile, that\nthis Court addressed in the Rutherford decision. In that\ncase, 17 States had made a judgment that Laetrile was --\ncould be available, for prescription use, to treat cancer.\nAnd the FDA, by refusing to approve Laetrile --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the FDA.\nI'm talking about the Attorney General, under this\nstatute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, then I think I would --\nI mean, I -- I'm not sure I can point to a decision by the\nAttorney General, but I think it's -- in the structure of\nthis Act -- obviously the schedule 1 treatment of\nmarijuana that this Court had before it in the Raich case,\ninvolved a situation where the Act clearly displaced the\nmedical judgments of California and nine other States --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- who recognized --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that was a clear act of\nCongress. I mean, Congress had made that decision, and it\nwas unmistakable. It seems to me that the problem that\nyou have, with your reference back to the Harrison Act and\nthe 90 years of regulation, is that the 90 years of\nregulation was regulation for the purpose of stopping drug\npushing and drug abuse, in the conventional sense. And to\nsay that a statute -- or a statutory history taken into\nconsideration in determining the scope of this statute,\nwith that kind of a history, can support a view that\nsuddenly the Attorney General of the United States is\ngiven, in effect, the sole authority to determine whether\nany State may or may not authorize assisted suicide, and\nmay do so in a way that any other Attorney General can\nflip back and forth -- as has happened in this case, if\nAttorney General Reno was wrong -- seems to me a kind of\nargument from history that simply cuts against you,\nbecause it leads to a sort of a bizarre result. I mean,\nwhat is your response to that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I think\nyou have to look at the regulation of drug abuse and ask,\nTo what end was Congress regulating these substances?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, and I -- as I said, it\nseems to me that your 91 years of history say that the end\nthat Congress had in mind was to stop drug pushing and\nstop conventional drug abuse. It didn't have any more --\nthere's no indication that I know of that Congress had\nassisted suicide in mind, any more than it had the\nadministration of the death penalty in mind.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, what I\nwould say is, what Congress had in mind in enacting these\nsubstances is, they were concerned about drug abuse, not\nfor its own sake, but for the debilitating effect it has\non people's lives, for its tendency to destroy lives. And\nI will grant you that Congress, in 1970, did not have\nbefore it in its contemplation a State that would make\nphysician-assisted suicide lawful. But that's because it\nwould have been unthinkable at that time. And what\nCongress did have clearly in its contemplation is the fact\nthat a clear manifestation of a drug's potential for abuse\nwas the fact that it could lead to suicide and overdoses.\nAnd that's page 35 of the House report, for those that\nlook at legislative history. And I actually think that's\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Suicide is a result of the kind\nof dementia that comes from drug abuse. That is not\nsuicide under the circumstances that we're talking about\nwithin the limits of the Oregon law.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Congress didn't specify,\none way or another. And what I would -- I would point you\nto the House report, because I think it actually is\nindicative, because when Congress is framing the issue,\nthey first look at the extent of the problem. And one of\nthe ways they identify the problem as serious is, they\npoint to overdoses that are taking place among teenagers.\nAnd then, in the next section of the report, they look at\nthe question of the consequences of drug abuse. And what\ndo they point to as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General, then may I just ask\nthis question? We're focusing on whether congress really\nauthorized this action by the Attorney General. And in\nthe Raich case, which, of course, was a close case --\nthere were three dissents in the case -- the -- there was\ngreat attention on the fact Congress had considered the\ninterstate market for the product involved, an impact on\nthe market if it was allowed to be sold in -- or grown and\nso forth in California. But is there any evidence at all\nthat Congress thought that any of these -- schedule 2 or 3\nsubstances that are used in assisted-suicide situations --\nthat Congress focused on the impact of that use on the\ninterstate market for those drugs?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I mean,\nI -- first of all, I would say, as it compared to Raich, I\nwould almost think this is an a fortiori case, as it\naffects commerce, because, unlike Raich, which, of course,\nwere untraditional noncommercial transactions, the\ntransactions at issue here are standard commercial\ntransactions that are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But are they --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- well within --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- are they transactions that\nhave any impact on any market, any commercial market, that\nCongress ever mentioned?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think they do. And I sure\nhope they do, because this is a situation where Congress\nand the Federal Government pervasively regulates the drug\ntransactions at issue here in a way that even respondents\ndon't object to. The details of the form that you fill\nout for the prescription, the fact that it has to be in\nwriting, the regulations specify whether it has to be in\npen or pencil -- I mean, there's such a pervasive\ninvolvement of the Federal Government in the regulation of\nthese controlled substances that I don't think there's any\nadditional commerce clause extension by regulating the\npurpose for which the prescription is being made. That's\nwhat the DEA did in the context of Marinol, when it was\nfirst moved from schedule 1 to schedule 2, that -- we\ndiscuss that in detail on page 30 of our brief. And I\nthink that kind of regulation, although it's not a common\nfeature of the DEA in its administration of the Controlled\nSubstances Act, is an important one, is a legitimate one.\nAnd I guess what I would say, with respect to\nCongress's intent, is, it seems to me odd to think that a\nCongress that was concerned about overdoses, concerned\nabout suicides, would be indifferent or agnostic on the\nquestion of using federally controlled substances for the\nexpress purpose of inducing a lethal overdose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why were -- you were going to\nsay, at one point -- why was Congress concerned about\noverdoses of narcotics and so forth? Why?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think they were concerned\nwith it part and parcel of -- because, I mean, I think of\nthe things that Congress does when it regulates is, it\nregulates to protect life, to protect health and safety --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, there was a\nreason, wasn't there, that they're worried about people\ntaking narcotics?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, sure --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- there are. Sure they are.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. What was the main --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And they're worried about the\nimpact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought it was\nnarcotics addiction.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think it is, but,\nagain, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, if it is\nnarcotics addiction --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But not solely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I would have thought\nthat was it --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, not solely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. All right. Again,\nbecause you know I'm going to say, What has this got to do\nwith that? So, why not solely?\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not solely. You go ahead.\nWhat else?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not solely. And, again, I\nmean, I think, you know, addiction qua addiction was not\nthe concern so much as addiction because of its tendency\nto debilitate lives --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to destroy lives --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, but it's true\naddiction. And this seems to --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no, I don't think that's\nright, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think there are a number of\ninstances where the abuse that is being -- that Congress\nis concerned with is not solely the addictive abuse. I\nmean, to take one example, Congress has recently, as part\nof the controlled substances regime, regulated GHB, one of\nthese so-called \"date-rape drugs.\" And the concern for\nabuse there is not its addictive quality, but the fact\nthat it can be used in a way that's not medical, that can\nbe very pernicious, and the like. And so, I think that's\njust another example of this concept of abuse being much\nbroader than a narrow focus on diversion or a narrow focus\non addiction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but even in your example,\nthe concern of Congress is with the use of the drug to\nhurt people who do not understand that they're going to be\nhurt, and don't want to be hurt, and perhaps, in your\nexample, the use of the drug to facilitate the violation\nof the law, that seems to me worlds away from what we're\ntalking about here.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I would\nsimply say that the Controlled Substances Act, if you look\nat it, is a very paternalistic piece of legislation. It's\nnot designed to let people make their own judgments about\nthe health risk.\nAnd if I could reserve the remainder of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nClement.\nMr. Atkinson.\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. ATKINSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSince Gibbons versus Ogden, at the very latest,\nthis Court has recognized that, in the system of dual\nsovereignty created by American federalism --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you speak up just a\nlittle, please?\nMR. ATKINSON: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I will.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe elevate your -- the\nmicrophone.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Maybe you could raise the\npodium.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're too tall.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ATKINSON: I'll work on that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Raise it up.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No, that -- the crank will\nraise it, if you -- no, the other way around.\nThank you.\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nWhat the Court said in Gibbons versus Ogden was\nthat health laws of every description were for the States\nto regulate. In Glucksberg, this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the relationship\nbetween the States and the Federal Government has changed\na little since Gibbons versus Ogden.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ATKINSON: That's certainly true, Your\nHonor. And yet I think if you look both at your opinion\nin Glucksberg and in the opinion -- excuse me -- and in\nthe text of the Controlled Substances Act, you will find\nthat this Court has recognized that this specific subject,\nphysician-assisted dying, is one that is for the States to\nregulate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that begs the\nquestion -- if you had said \"this specific subject,\" the\nregulation of controlled substances, your answer would\nhave come out the other way, which is kind of what the\ncase is about.\nMR. ATKINSON: I agree. And let me talk, then,\nabout the -- why we believe the text of the statute\ndemonstrates that Congress intended to leave the decision\nabout what is, and is not, a legitimate medical practice\nto the States, as it has always been. And that's the key\nquestion in this case, because the U.S. Attorney General\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, because, I mean, wouldn't\n-- suppose that some State said that, \"We think doctors\ncan prescribe, for people who want to take it, morphine\nfor recreational use.\"\nMR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, there are a number of\nlimits clear in the Controlled Substances Act. But taking\nthe hypothetical you've offered, specifically, we think\nthat the answer would have to be that Congress intended to\nleave the definition of what is a legitimate medical\npractice to the States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter what? I mean, they\nhave cases and so forth that say, \"Of course a State could\ngo too far. A State might decided it's\" -- just what I\nsaid. And you're going to say your case turns or falls --\nyou win or lose, depending on whether I accept that a\nState could not stop a doctor from becoming, in effect, a\nconduit to a group of drug dealers by saying, \"I think\nrecreational use is part of my medical practice\"? That\nwould be up to the State?\nMR. ATKINSON: Certainly, the State could stop\nit, yes. The question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it didn't \"stop it\" --\nMR. ATKINSON: But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but could the State allow\nit?\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if the State allowed it,\nthe Federal Government would have to allow the drugs to be\nused for that purpose --\nMR. ATKINSON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you're saying.\nMR. ATKINSON: -- there are a number of limits\nin the text of the Act itself. There are limits in other\nFederal statutes not contained in the CSA. There is also\nthe political limits on irresponsible lawmaking at both\nthe State and the Federal level that have served us well\nfor almost 200 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that at\nthe time this legislation was enacted, it would have been\nas unthinkable for a State to allow drugs to be used -- to\nbe prescribed by a doctor to kill a patient as it would be\nfor drugs to be subscribed by a doctor to make the patient\nfeel better.\nMR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, many drugs --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I think that assisted\nsuicide would have been as unthinkable at the time this\nwas enacted as prescribing cocaine just for recreational\nuse.\nMR. ATKINSON: We don't suggest that Congress\nhad physician-assisted dying specifically in mind at the\ntime that it enacted the Controlled Substances Act. What\nwe do think that Congress had in mind was the 200-year\nhistory of State regulation of medicine, of the practice\nof medicine, and what were, and were not, legitimate\nmedical purposes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you agree -- you -- in\nanswer to Justice Breyer's question, he mentioned a drug\nthat was a schedule 1 drug, morphine. Or maybe --\nMR. ATKINSON: I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- perhaps it isn't --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- I think it is a schedule 2\ndrug, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's schedule 2 drug.\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes. We certainly don't suggest\nthat a State could authorize the use of a schedule 1 drug\nfor any purpose at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you saying that if\nthe doctor is using it, saying, \"In my medical judgment,\nthis makes people happy; and, therefore, I'm going to\nprescribe it,\" that a State could permit that? Wouldn't\nthe Moore case rule that out?\nMR. ATKINSON: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nThere aren't -- there is no history of the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral prosecuting any doctor at any time in the -- in\nthe -- since before Moore --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the idea of\nMoore was, if you're using this, the doctor is prescribing\nthe drug as a pusher.\nMR. ATKINSON: That's correct. And we have no\n-- we have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but let's -- but\nthe supposition is that the State legal judgment is that\nthat's the wrong characterization, that it's legitimate\nmedical practice to make patients feel better, and\nmorphine does that; and so, the State can allow them to\nprescribe morphine to make people feel better. And I\nunderstand your position to be that that would be\npermissible?\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That could not -- that's\nnot prohibited under the Controlled --\nMR. ATKINSON: That is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Substances Act.\nMR. ATKINSON: -- that is not prohibited under\nthe Controlled Substances Act if the doctor was acting\nconsistent with the specific terms of the Act and the\nspecific terms of the State statutes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you say the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States could not deem it to be drug\nabuse under the Act if a State allowed that for\nrecreational use or to cure depression or -- How about\nsteroids for bodybuilders? -- and decided that's perfectly\nokay. Now, can the Attorney General find that that's drug\nabuse?\nMR. ATKINSON: As the term \"drug abuse\" is used\nin the statute, Justice O'Connor, it is used expressly in\nterms of the scheduling decisions that the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral is authorized to make, and required to make. It\nis not otherwise generally used. What the Controlled\nSubstance --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I don't know that I\nunderstand your answer. Could the Attorney General deem\nthe authorization -- purported authorization by a\nphysician to use morphine to help with depression, or\nsteroids for bodybuilding -- can that Attorney General\nsay, under the Act, that's drug abuse?\nMR. ATKINSON: Not if it is permitted by -- and\nregulated by State law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I disagreed with you\nabout that, then would you lose the case?\nMR. ATKINSON: I would certainly lose ground,\nYour Honor.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking, if I disagreed with\nyou that I thought -- we take the facts of Moore, where\nhe's a drug pusher, the doctor, and, for some unknown\nreason, the State says, \"That's fine, it doesn't violate\nState law,\" but the Attorney General says, \"Do what you\nwant about State law. I think it violates the Federal\nlaw.\" Suppose I think the Attorney General does have the\nright to do that for -- assuming it -- assuming it -- then\nwhat do you say about this case?\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, first of all, we don't\nthink, Justice Breyer, that what the U.S. Attorney General\nis attempting to do here is reasonable within the scope of\nwhatever authority he has. Moreover, he has not followed\nthe processes and procedures that are specified in the\nControlled Substances Act. But our first position in this\ncase is, he simply lacks the authority to do that.\nThe Controlled Substances Act reflects, first,\nin Section 903, the anti-preemption provision, which is\nfound in the State's brief, at page 36, that Congress\nintended not to intrude on State laws that would otherwise\nbe within the authority of the State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that do to the\neffectiveness of regulation under the Controlled\nSubstances Act? If one State can say it's legal for\ndoctors to prescribe morphine to make people feel better,\nor to prescribe steroids for bodybuilding, doesn't that\nundermine the uniformity of the Federal law and make\nenforcement impossible?\nMR. ATKINSON: I don't believe it does, Mr.\nChief Justice. In the first instance, we think the U.S.\nAttorney General's claim of uniformity is overstated. We\nthink it's clear from the text of the statute that\nCongress intended to leave the definition of what is, or\nis not, a legitimate medical practice in the hands --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that may or --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- of the States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- may not be true. But\nfocus on the particular question. If you have one State\nthat allows the use of a drug that the Federal Government\nhas determined is illegal, and is illegal everywhere else\nbecause other States haven't done it, how is the Federal\nGovernment supposed to enforce that prohibition?\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, I don't think the Federal\nGovernment is supposed to enforce that prohibition if the\nprohibition -- if we're dealing with a schedule 2, 3, or 4\nor 5 substance. Congress has clearly spoken to schedule 1\nsubstances. Once we move into the other substances,\ntraditionally and has -- as has -- as been the -- as is\nthe case today in every State, physicians, under the\nregulation of State medical boards, prescribe those\nmedications for purposes other than those for which\nthey're normally prescribed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to get at the\nspecific enforcement point. If you have one State that\nallows morphine to be used legally for --\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- recreational\npurposes, how is the Federal Government supposed to\nenforce the prohibition on that elsewhere?\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, there is no -- well, the\nCongress can prescribe -- can enforce it in any State in\nwhich it is not authorized by State law. If the U.S.\nAttorney General wants to regulate it in a State where it\nis authorized by State law, he must go to Congress and get\na clear statement of authority to do that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But are you saying, in response\nto the Chief Justice's question, that, in fact, Congress,\nitself, could not explicitly pass a statute that says, \"No\nState, through its doctors or otherwise, may authorize the\nuse of morphine\" --\nMR. ATKINSON: Not at all, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. So, you're not\nmaking a --\nMR. ATKINSON: No, not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- constitutional --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- argument. You're sticking\nto your statutory argument.\nMR. ATKINSON: We're sticking to the statutory\nargument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which comes down to an argument\nthat \"accepted medical practice\" means accepted medical\npractice State by State --\nMR. ATKINSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- rather than on some uniform\nbasis. Do you have any other area, regarding the\nenforcement of this Act, where the drug is allowed, or not\nallowed, to be used on the basis of divergent views of\nmedical practice by divergent States?\nMR. ATKINSON: There are any number of areas in\nwhich --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Such as?\nMR. ATKINSON: -- States diverge. Such as --\npalliative care, I think, is the most obvious example.\nThese days, there is a great deal of divergence among the\nStates as to how --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In palliative care? And you\nthink in some States you can -- you can prescribe these\ndrugs without violating the Act; whereas, in other States,\nthe same prescription would violate the Act.\nMR. ATKINSON: In some States, a prescription\nwould violate State law; and in other cases, in other\nStates, that same prescription would not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it violate the Federal\nlaw in those other States?\nMR. ATKINSON: It would if the -- if the\nprescription violated the State law, the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral could take action against the physician.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. So you say that in -- with\nrespect to many aspects of this legislation, what's lawful\n-- and what's lawful depends upon the accepted medical\npractice within the State.\nMR. ATKINSON: That's exactly correct, Justice\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does this have to be reflected\nin the State medical board determinations, or just in what\nthe -- what the doctors in that region tend to think is a\ngood idea?\nMR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, what we believe is\nthat what Congress did in enacting the Controlled\nSubstances Act was leave those decisions to the States to\nenforce according to their traditional methods. Now, in\nsome cases, that may be by statute; in some cases, the\nStates may discipline doctors for -- through a State\nmedical board.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any cases that you can think of\nwhere the same prescription has been held okay in one\nState and not okay in another State?\nMR. ATKINSON: Your Honor, we're not aware of\nany cases in which the U.S. Attorney General has ever\nattempted to de-register or to prosecute a doctor who was\nacting in accordance with State law. We have a history\nthat we're -- to -- at least since the Controlled\nSubstances Act, in 1970, where the U.S. Attorney General\nhas never attempted to suggest, as he does here, that\nsomething that is permissible under State law is, in any\nsense, a violation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- of the Controlled Substances\nAct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- statute goes beyond the\nState law, the five factors, you know, on the -- justify\nthe --\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- revocation. And some are\nin compliance with State law, but the fifth factor is,\n\"such other conduct which may threaten the public health\nand safety.\" It seems to me that's a clear grant of\nauthority to go beyond State law.\nMR. ATKINSON: Justice Stevens, we think that\nthe best reading of the five factors is that they continue\nto respect State laws. Certainly, that's what the\nlegislative history, for those of you who would be willing\nto look at it, of the 1984 amendments reflects. Congress\nwas not concerned about how States were defining\nlegitimate medical practices. Congress was concerned\nabout the failure to enforce existing State law. And\nthat's clearly reflected in the legislative history, some\nof which is set out in the State's brief, on page 36, in\nnote 16. But if you look at those five factors, what they\nare addressed to is individual applicants -- that is,\nindividual doctors -- not to broad medical purposes.\nAnd what you're seeing here in the Attorney\nGeneral's claim of authority, for the first time, is rules\nthat are not addressed to controlled substances, per se,\nbut to medical practices, and that is something that the\nCongress simply never contemplated giving you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do you do\nwith regulation 1306, which -- the one that, of course,\ntalks about \"legitimate medical purpose\"? That was\npromulgated in 1971. It wasn't directed to the Oregon\nstatute. And yet it suggests that the Attorney General\nhas the authority to interpret that phrase.\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, we think there's -- there\nare two answers to that, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice. The\nfirst is that, in Harris versus Christensen, this Court\nsaid that a Federal agent cannot promulgate a new\nregulation in the guise of interpreting an old one. Now,\nin 1971, when that regulation to which you refer was\nenacted, it was absolutely clear that the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral could not have de-registered an Oregon doctor who\nwas acting in accordance with State law, because, as this\nCourt pointed out in United States versus Moore, the\nregistration was a matter -- was as a matter of right if\nthe -- if the physician was in good standing with State\nmedical authorities.\nSo, what he's attempting to do today, in the\nguise of interpreting that rule, is to make it mean\nsomething entirely different than what it meant when he\nenacted it. And I think Christensen versus Harris County\nsays that he simply cannot do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You had a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- second answer?\nMR. ATKINSON: Excuse me?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You had a\nsecond answer?\nMR. ATKINSON: That's all right. I'm -- I --\nI'm happy with the first one, at this point.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Atkinson, you've spent most\nof your time talking about the statute and the\nregulations. Do you also make the argument that ,even if\nthe Government wanted to do this thing, it would be\nunconstitutional?\nMR. ATKINSON: We do, Your Honor. One of the\nquestions presented in Raich was whether Congress \"could\"\ndo what it had done. The question here is -- first of\nall, is whether Congress \"did\" what it had done. And our\npoint is not necessarily that it would be\nunconstitutional, but that it would raise a significant\nconstitutional question, which implicates the clear-\nstatement rule and the constitutional avoidance rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why would it raise a\nsignificant constitutional question? I take it that it's\nnone of the Government's business whether people gamble or\nnot. I take it, it's none of the -- the Federal\nGovernment -- I take it, it's none of the Federal\nGovernment's business whether people are allowed to drink\nat 21 or at 18, innumerable other things, which really are\nmatters that belong to the police power of the States.\nBut the Federal Government has chosen to regulate those\nthings through the use of its commerce power. Is the\ndrinking age any more a matter of -- or any less a matter\nof State privilege than suicide?\nMR. ATKINSON: No, I wouldn't say that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, are those -- are those\nentries of the Federal Government into the regulation of\ndrinking age, are they unconstitutional --\nMR. ATKINSON: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or do they raise serious\nconstitutional questions?\nMR. ATKINSON: No, they don't, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why does this one? I\ndon't --\nMR. ATKINSON: The difference here is simply\nthat there -- the amounts, as was suggested earlier, are\nso minute that there cannot be any significant effect on\ninterstate commerce. There is not even any evidence in\nthis record that there is a market for the drugs that are\nused under the Death with Dignity Act, much less if there\nis an illicit trade. There's no question here of -- as\nthe Court described it in Raich, where you had a $10\nbillion market of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if ten States adopted\nassisted suicide, it might be a different -- a different\n--\nMR. ATKINSON: Once again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- constitutional --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- Your Honor, in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- question.\nMR. ATKINSON: -- in Oregon's experience, we\nhave a small number of people, most of whom consume the\ndrug. The amounts that are left over, even if this law\nspread nationwide, would not be significant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you spend a minute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The statute gives the Attorney\nGeneral authority to promulgate regulations for the\ndispensing of drug -- 821 -- and that seems to me to\ndescribe precisely what the Attorney General has done\nhere.\nMR. ATKINSON: I can't disagree with that,\nJustice Kennedy. The question is, Does he have authority\nto tell a doctor in a particular State, not by reference\nto a particular drug that he may not dispense this drug,\nbut that he may not dispense a drug for a specific medical\npurpose? And, as I've suggested, this is the first time\nwe've ever seen that happen. And we think that's because\nit's inconsistent with the congressional design, which was\nto leave the subject of what are, and are not, legitimate\nmedical purposes to the States and to -- and to have the\nU.S. Attorney General promulgate rules that deal with\nthings like the -- like prescriptions, scheduling of those\ndrugs so that they are on schedule 2 or schedule 3 or\nperhaps --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- schedule 1.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- very odd to have a\nregulation on dispensing that takes no account of the\npurpose for which the drug is being used.\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, we think it's somewhat\nodder, frankly, Justice Kennedy, to suggest that Congress\nintended to authorize a single unelected Federal official\nto decide, in his sole and apparently un-reviewable\ndiscretion, that this medical practice, of which he\ndisapproves, may not be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I give --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- followed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you a statutory reference,\nand then you tell me about something else.\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, no, I -- we agree that he\ngets to authorize regulations on dispensation -- to\nrequire, for example, that there be prescriptions before\nit be dispensed, that physicians shall follow certain\nrules and regulations before they dispense, and those are\nthe kinds of things on which we agree he has the authority\nto engage in rulemaking and to -- and to promulgate\nuniform --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, on that, I didn't\nthink that the reg was defining the word \"dispense.\" I\nthought the statute defines the word \"dispense.\" And it's\n-- persons registered by the AG to dispense controlled\nsubstances are exempt. And then you look at who is such a\nperson. A person who does that is a practitioner. And\nwho is a practitioner? A registered practitioner is one\nwho prescribes, a physician registered by the United\nStates to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in\nthe course of professional practice. And I thought this\nreg is defining \"in the course of professional practice.\"\nAm I wrong about that? I thought it was a reg that says,\n\"In the course of professional practice, the prescription,\nto be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by\nan individual practitioner.\" Now, I might be wrong. How\ndoes it work?\nMR. ATKINSON: No, I think that's absolutely\nright. But the question -- that is a very different\nquestion from the question of, Who gets to define, as a\nmatter of policy, what is a \"legitimate medical practice\"?\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the matter of policy, I\nwould -- since -- if you -- if you've said basically what\nyou want to say in your argument, I would appreciate your\ndevoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to\nagree with. But suppose I were to assume that a State is\nnot free, through the device of defining what's good\nmedical practice, to gut the Act -- that is, to really\nmake marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal --\nbecause they disagree with Congress's basic judgment that\nit should be illegal. That could happen.\nMR. ATKINSON: It could.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose I think that the\nAG does have the power to stop Congress from gutting the\nAct. All right? Now, on that, do I have -- if I believe\nthat, on that assumption, do I have to decide this case\nagainst you?\nMR. ATKINSON: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if not, why not?\nMR. ATKINSON: There are at least two reasons\nfor that, Justice Breyer. The first is the commerce-\nclause question, which we believe to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose, on the commerce-clause\nquestion, I -- on assumption, I don't agree with you,\neither -- then do I have to decide?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ATKINSON: I'm starting to be backed into a\ncorner.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ATKINSON: I think -- I think the third\nanswer then becomes the procedural answer, Justice Breyer,\nand that is that what the U.S. Attorney General is doing\nhere violates the rule this Court stated in Christensen\nversus Harris County, and he is attempting to do, by an\nadministrative rule, what he can only do by notice in\ncomment rulemaking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Far be it from me to suggest an\nargument that you don't want to make, but, I mean, I've\nfound it different, in life and law, when you pass a rule\nin a State that guts an Act, from when you pass the rule\nin a State that doesn't seem to have much to do with the\npurpose of the Act.\nMR. ATKINSON: Well, I certainly would not\ndisagree with that in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you would. I think --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me -- it seems to\nme that you -- that you cannot accept the premise that it\nguts the Act, if you come in here with the proposition,\nwhich you do, that what the Act says is: whatever is\naccepted medical practice within the State is okay.\nThat's your principal point.\nMR. ATKINSON: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the Act does not refer to\nany overall Federal accepted medical practice. It refers\nto accepted medical practice, State by State. And,\ntherefore, it in no way guts the Act if a State wants to\nlet these drugs be used for, you know, make-people-happy\npurposes. I don't see how you can accept the premise.\nMR. ATKINSON: I wasn't anxious to accept it,\nJustice Scalia, but I --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ATKINSON: -- I was -- I thought I was being\ntold to. Let me --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ATKINSON: -- but let me -- let me offer, if\nI can -- we --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, in -- Mr.\nAtkinson, in response to the question you were just asked,\nyou said there were procedural problems, no notice in\ncomment. So, that's a \"how\" it's done.\nMR. ATKINSON: That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the \"who\"? Is this\nsomething -- how does it work under the Controlled\nSubstance Act? What authority does the Department of HHS\nhave? What is the division of authority between those two\nunder the Act? The Attorney General, on the one hand, and\nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and including\nthe FDA, on the other.\nMR. ATKINSON: Justice Ginsburg, I can't answer\nthat question in specific respect to this case, because\nthere is no authority in the Controlled Substances Act for\nanyone to do what has been done here -- that is, to focus\non the specific medical practice and say, \"No controlled\nsubstance\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you made --\nMR. ATKINSON: -- \"can be used for\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you made a point earlier\nthat the Attorney General has never done this before, has\nnever said, \"You can't prescribe particular drugs for\" --\nhas -- that has not been done. You've been giving\nexamples of where the FDA ruled that you can't --\nMR. ATKINSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- use a drug. And that\ncontrol is nationwide, no matter what the State medical\nboard thinks, right?\nMR. ATKINSON: Yes. There is -- there are --\nfor example, in scheduling of drugs -- and the U.S.\nAttorney General suggests, for example, that he could\nsimply schedule these drugs in a way to -- as a way of\navoiding the Oregon Act -- or voiding the Oregon Act, as\nit were. And, to do that, he has to get his medical and\nscientific advice from the Secretary of Health and\nServices, and must accept that advice and be bound by it.\nAnd certainly, that wasn't done in this case. So, I hope\nthat answers your question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who -- the consultation, you\nsaid, was not with HHS, and it wasn't with Oregon? Who\ndid the Attorney General consult?\nMR. ATKINSON: To the best of our knowledge, it\nwas solely done within the Department of Justice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May ask this question\nconcerning the -- Justice Scalia's suggestion that you're\ninsisting the States would have the authority to act\nindependently of a congressional prohibition against the\nuse of a substance to make people happy and so forth.\nIsn't your point in this case that Congress hasn't really\nspoken to the issue to which the Attorney General has\nspoken?\nMR. ATKINSON: That's exactly right, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is the opposite of the\ncase that Justice Scalia point, where the Congress has\nspoken to the issue.\nMR. ATKINSON: And there are circumstances in\nwhich it has, and those in which it has not. And to try\nto respond to Justice Scalia's point, again I would invoke\nthe 200 years of responsible regulation of the practice of\nmedicine, which is the backdrop against which Congress\nlegislated in this case. Congress does not lightly\nassume, nor should it, that States are going to -- are\ngoing to simply legalize drugs to make people happy. It\nhasn't happened. Congress doesn't assume it's going to\nhappen. States act responsibly. Congress assumes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in 1971\nCongress didn't assume the States were going to pass\nlegislation for use of drugs to assist with suicide,\neither.\nMR. ATKINSON: No, that's certainly true, Mr.\nChief Justice. But Congress knew, as we all know, that\nthe practice of medicine evolves, that things change, that\ntoday's -- acupuncture, the use of Botox, things that were\nunheard of 30 years ago, are all accepted medical\npractices today, and they are all regulated by the States,\nnot by the U.S. Attorney General. And the question here\nis whether Congress intended to enact a uniform medical\npractices --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These are all different manners\nof assisting people to stay alive or assisting people to\nfeel better. Assisting people to die is something of a\ntotally different category.\nMR. ATKINSON: Justice Scalia, I have to\ndisagree. There's a great deal of medical practice now,\nand attention, focused on end-of-life issues. This Court\nhas seen them. For example, in Cruzan, the Court said it\nis a matter for the States to decide those things. The\nCourt has seen cases that involve do-not-resuscitate\norders. The Court is familiar with living wills. There\nare any number of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't deny that. I -- I'm\nnot taking a position on whether, you know, a State wants\nto allow it, or not. I'm just taking a position on\nwhether it was envisioned by Congress, in 1971, that\naccepted medical practice would include prescribing drugs\nto help somebody end his life. And I don't think it -- I\ndon't think it would have occurred to Congress.\nMR. ATKINSON: I don't think that it would have\noccurred to them either, Justice Scalia, but I do think\nwhat occurred to them was that that was a matter that,\nlike any other matter dealing with the regulation of\nmedical practice, the States could be trusted to act\nresponsibly. That's what Oregon has done here. That's\nwhat this Court invited the States to do in Glucksberg.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it you would agree\nthat, in effect, all you need to win on the statutory\nargument is for us to accept the premise that Congress may\nvery well have intended to interfere with the practice of\nmedicine and to authorize the Attorney General to do it,\ninsofar as the practice of medicine would have gutted the\nstatute -- e.g., doctors who prescribe recreational drugs,\ndoctors who, in effect, cater to pushers -- but that\nCongress did not intend to go any further than that in\nauthorizing interference with the practice of medicine. I\ntake it you agree that if we accepted that premise, that\nwould be sufficient for you in this case.\nMR. ATKINSON: That's absolutely true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. ATKINSON: That's absolutely true, Justice\nSouter. But -- this case is obviously about statutory\nconstruction, but it's about statutory construction in a\nvery special area, and that is the area of federalism, of\nthe relationship between the sovereign States and the\nFederal Government. We think it's clear, from examining\nthe statute, that Congress intended to retain and respect\nthe historic powers of the States to define legitimate\nmedical practices.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nGeneral Clement, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think Respondents have embraced the logical\nconsequences of their position. And what it results in is\nturning the Controlled Substances Act, the federal\nControlled Substances Act, into an odd patchwork. It also\nis profoundly a-historical, because, at the time of the\nHarrison Act of 1914 -- which the Controlled Substances\nAct was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this Court\npointed out in Moore -- at that time, the States had a\nvariety of different approaches to opium and heroin and\nother -- and cocaine and other substances -- opium and\ncocaine now of which land on schedule 2. Some of them\ntightly regulated them, some of them allowed them in over-\nthe-counter tonics in large quantities. And the point of\nthe Harrison Act was to clean that up and impose a uniform\nFederal regime. And they knew it would have an impact on\nState regulation of medicine. And even the Court, in the\nLinder days, recognize that that was not, per se, a\nconstitutional problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what about gutting? Never\nmind Mr. Atkinson's argument. What about gutting?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it's an odd statutory --\nI mean, I'm not familiar with the -- with the principle\nthat the Federal authority only extends to prevent that\nwhich would gut the statute, and no further. That seems\nlike an odd principle. And I think that, here, it is a\nperfectly legitimate interpretation of this statute to say\nthat a Congress that was profoundly concerned with\noverdoses, with suicide, with drug abuse, precisely\nbecause of its debilitating effect on people's lives,\nwould not have been agnostic at the prospect of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At the time --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- controlled substances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- at the time this\nstatute was passed to deal with lax State treatment of\nopium, was opium regulated as part of medical practice in\nany of the States?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It was, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThey were all over the map, but there was clearly a\nrecognition that doctors were part and parcel of the\nproblem, that there were needs in States to more closely\nregulate both the doctors and the pharmacies. That was,\nkind of, the two problems that gave rise to this. And\nthere's no question that the impact of the Federal program\nwas profound on the State's practice of medicine.\nNonetheless, that program was upheld, and that has been\nthe tradition in this area.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the impact profound\nbecause they were in what's now schedule 1, that they were\njust prohibited? In other words, were doctors allowed to\nprescribe opium for some purposes?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They were. And opium's now on\nschedule 2. The Harrison Act did not have the schedules\nwe're familiar with from the Controlled Substance. But\nmost of what was at issue -- I mean, opium, in its various\nforms, morphine, all of that of that is now on schedule 2,\nand that's really what prompted the Harrison Act in the\nfirst instance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question?\nIf the Attorney General determined that acupuncture was\nconduct that threatened the public health and safety,\ncould he de-license, or revoke, the license of doctors who\nengaged in acupuncture?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice\nStevens. It's the same reason as my answer earlier, which\nis, I think you have to look at this regime, and read it\nin light of the 90 years of Federal involvement in the\nregulation of controlled substances and the lack of a\ntraditional Federal role in regulating medicine qua\nmedicine. And I think this is on the -- on the side of\nthe line of regulating controlled substances.\nWith respect to the commerce-clause issue, I\nwould -- thought that one thing that came clear out of the\nRaich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is\nnot the class of activities that a State decides to\ndecriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that\nCongress decides to regulate.\nAnd with respect to schedule 2 substances, I\nwould think this case is a fortiori. We're not talking\nabout substances that are homegrown and are never part of\na commercial transaction. And even those who were in the\ndissent in Raich, I think, would think that this was an\nappropriate commerce-clause application. This case is to\nRaich as the regulation of commercial farming would be to\nWickard against Filburn. It is a much different\nsituation. Congress's commerce-clause power is more\nrobust here.\nI wanted to remark and focus for a minute on\nwhat an odd statute Oregon has passed. The practitioner\nrespondents point out it is a prescribing law only. And\nOregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the\nprescription, but not the administration, of these\nsubstances.\nEven what Oregon does, does not purport to be\nmedicine, as one traditionally understands it. I can\nthink of no other medical substance where a doctor can\nprescribe it, but not administer it. And I think if you\nlook at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is\nthat Oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to\nbasically take a Federal regulatory regime that allows\ndoctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nClement.\n"
