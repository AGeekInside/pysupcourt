Holder.\nMr. Coleman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nAfter more than 20 years of steadfast\ncompliance with the Voting Rights Act, Northwest Austin\nMUD Number One is entitled to be free from the intrusive\nburdens of preclearance. The district is entitled to\nseek a bailout because it is a political subdivision\nunder the Court's decisions in Sheffield and Dougherty\nCounty. This natural parallelism between bailout and\npreclearance allows bailout to serve its ameliorative\npurposes of encouraging, recognizing, and rewarding\nlong-term compliance and progress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may be -- it may\nbe a political subdivision under those decisions, but\nit's certainly not a political subdivision under the\nstatutory definition.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, we disagree with that,\nYour Honor. We believe that under Dougherty County in\nparticular, the Court specifically recognized that these\nentities such as cities and school boards and utility\ndistricts are political subdivisions and that that term\nas it's used --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Bailout wasn't involved\nin those cases. And what do you do with a statute that\nhas three categories -- the State, political\nsubdivision, and then there's \"governmental unit\"? The\ndistrict qualifies as a governmental unit. Why would\nCongress add that third category if the district came\nwithin \"political subdivision\"?\nMR. COLEMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the term\n\"governmental unit\" doesn't actually appear in the\nprovision that authorizes bailout. What it says is that\nwhen a political subdivision seeks a bailout that, if it\nhas any governmental units within it, it must also\nensure that they are compliant before it can have a\nbailout. For instance, although the district is not a\npolitical subdivision of the county, it is in the\ncounty, and therefore under the substantive criteria, if\nthe -- Travis County wanted to bail out, it would have\nto demonstrate compliance of all of those governmental\nunits within it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the -- but the\nstatute does use the term \"governmental unit\" to\nencompass districts. And if they were also\nsubdivisions, why would Congress need to add an\nadditional category?\nMR. COLEMAN: Again, I disagree with Your\nHonor that -- that the term \"governmental unit\" appears\nin the provision that defines criteria.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It appears in the statute\ntwice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three\ncategories.\nMR. COLEMAN: Again, the statute that\ndefines who's eligible to bailout says a State, a\npolitical subdivision that has been separately\ndesignated for coverage under 4(b), and a political\nsubdivision that has not been separately designated for\ncoverage.\nWe were never separately designated for\ncoverage. And under Sheffield and Dougherty County, we\nhave long been considered a political subdivision.\nIndeed, we are subject to the process of preclearance\nonly because we were a political subdivision. The\nactual requirement that you send in preclearance\nsubmissions is on political subdivisions. We are\nsubject to lawsuits under section 2 because we are a\npolitical subdivision. We are subject to the\npossibility of Federal examiners because we are a\npolitical subdivision.\nAt no place in this Voting Rights Act, in\nany of the dozens of the uses of the term \"political\nsubdivision\" has this Court or Congress, other than the\ndesignation statute, separately suggested that a\npolitical subdivision such as the district would not be\nconsidered a political subdivision under the terms of\nthe Voting Rights Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to the extent we\nhave some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it\nwould be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's\njust unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered\njurisdiction within a county which is a covered\njurisdiction. They would have competing election days,\ncompeting election formulae. And it would seem to me\nthat that just makes compliance with the Act much more\ndifficult.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, certainly we believe\nthat the purposes of the Act suggest that we should be\nconsidered a political subdivision eligible to bail out.\nThis interaction between the county and the district --\nwe -- we exist within the county, but we are not part of\nthe county. The county, as we say, is not the boss of\nus. They don't have any way to ensure or require us to\ndo things. And as the facts of this case demonstrate,\nnot only did the county have different political\ninterests, but we've also demonstrated that because you\nhave entities that are subject to separate designation,\nlike the county, that have dozens and perhaps in this\ncase over a hundred separate political subdivisions,\nTravis County could never practically seek a bail out.\nAnd in order to give effect to what I call\nthis ameliorative purpose to bail out, the Court should\ninterpret the statute in a way that allows these small\nentities to bail out. These small entities --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And how do you account for\nthe fact that if your district were located in a\nseparately covered political subdivision, you clearly\ncould not bail out.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, I -- I -- again, the\nCourt doesn't need to reach that question yet, but I'm\nnot sure that the answer is that we clearly couldn't if\nwe were a separately designated or -- excuse me -- if we\nwere in a separately designated county that says --\nthat's it's not in a covered State, right? There is\nthis argument, for instance, that -- that that State\ncould be covered in whole or in part. And certainly,\nfor instance, in California the State is -- is covered\nin part. And it could be resolved in that way.\nThe statute is not exceptionally clear on\nit, but the Court doesn't have to reach that because we\nare in a fully covered State, and we are -- under all\nthe provisions of Voting Rights Act, have always been\nconsidered political subdivisions. The district court\nsaid you're a political subdivision for every purpose\nexcept this one. You have to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- the district\ncourt had some assistance from the legislative\ndevelopment of this latest extension. There was a\nproposal, was there not, to allow governmental units to\nbail out -- to allow anyone who was required to preclear\nto bail out?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't know that there was a\nspecific legislative proposal, Justice Ginsburg. There\nwas certainly some discussion of that. What -- what is\nparticularly clear is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what was the reason\nthat it was resisted?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't know that the record\nactually shows that it was resisted. It was simply part\nof the discussion during the reauthorization\nproceedings. I'm not aware of any specific resistance\nrelating to that. There weren't any amendments to the\nstatute, but the amendments in 1982, we do believe are\nvery important to the Court's consideration of that\nbecause the bailout aspects were considered in City of\nRome, and in City of Rome the only entities that could\nbail out were a -- were a State or a separately covered\nor a separately designated subdivision. And then 2\nyears after that, Congress amends the statute to add\nthis third category, which is political subdivisions\nthat have not been separately designated for coverage.\nThat amendment and that addition is clearly\nin direct response to City of Rome and, we believe, a\nclear indication that Congress did intend and, indeed,\nit said it intended to expand the bailout opportunities.\nCongress believed that many, if perhaps not most,\npolitical subdivisions in 1982 would be eligible for\nbailout, but because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Department of Justice\nhas -- does it -- does it not have a regulation that\ncontradicts your reading? And hasn't that been out\nthere -- wasn't it out there before the 2006 extension?\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but\nunlike the Attorney General's regulations that relate to\npreclearance, bailout is not something that the Attorney\nGeneral actually has any specific say in. The statute\nprovides for a lawsuit to seek a bailout. It's not like\npreclearance, where can you get it from either the\nAttorney General or the district court.\nNow, the Attorney General may choose, as it\nhas for several of the Virginia entities, not to resist\nthat. So you can file a friendly suit once the Attorney\nGeneral has been convinced, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we find that you're not\ncovered by the bailout provision, that only the county\nis, do you really then have standing to proceed to\nquestion the workability of the bailout procedures? I\n-- I suppose that would be a threshold argument for you\nto question the validity of the Act.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, with respect to our\nconstitutionality issue, Justice Kennedy, one thing\nnobody is contesting here is that we are not subject to\npreclearance. And so, if we are not eligible for\nbailout, we obviously do and we believe have standing to\nassert that the reenactment of the preclearance\nprovisions is unconstitutional because they, unlike the\nbailout, would clearly continue to apply to us.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, has preclearance been\ndenied to you?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, we didn't seek a\npreclearance --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. I mean, I -- if\n-- if you're basing it simply on your subjection to\npreclearance and there's no contest between you and the\ngovernment over preclearing anything, I'm not sure why\nyou would be in court.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, there is certainly a\npossibility we may seek to preclear things in the\nfuture, but this is primarily --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then isn't -- isn't that\nthe time for litigating?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Souter. This is\nprimarily a facial challenge to the statute. We are\nsubject to the obligations of preclearance. And we\nbelieve that we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not affecting\nanything you're doing on a day-to-day basis, as I\nunderstand it. There's no claim that -- that your\ndistrict is doing anything improper. No claim is being\nmade against you. And I guess your whole argument would\nbe maybe some day we want to preclear again, and maybe\nwe wouldn't be as successful as we had been in each of\nthe instances before. But I don't see how that gets you\nin court.\nMR. COLEMAN: I agree with -- I disagree\nwith that as well, Justice Souter. While it has not\nbeen highlighted in the briefs, there is deep in the\nrecord discussion during a MUD board meeting of\npotentially some changes, and discussion on that was\ntable pending the outcome of this lawsuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the last time\nthe district applied for preclearance, the last year?\nMR. COLEMAN: The contract in 2004 by which\nwe asked the county to actually perform the elections\nitself, that was precleared, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so 2004 is the last\nyear. So between 2004 and 2009 the district has not\nsought preclearance?\nMR. COLEMAN: That's correct. This lawsuit\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're subject to\npreclearance and you cannot make changes without going\nto the Attorney General and asking for his permission.\nMR. COLEMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it any different from,\nfrom a -- a Federal law prohibiting certain speech? Do\nyou have to subject yourself to the -- to the penalty\nfor that speech before you can attack the law? I don't\nthink so.\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the suit -- correct me\nif I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought\nthis suit eventuated from the fact that you had been\ndenied bailout and that your entire case was brought on\nthe refusal of bailout. I did not understand that you\nhad brought a general declaratory judgment action or\na -- or a facial attack in gross, as it were, on the\nstatute. Am I wrong about your pleadings?\nMR. COLEMAN: I do think you're wrong about\nthat, Justice Souter. We had not been denied bailout.\nThe suit sought bailout. The only way to seek a bailout\nis through the lawsuit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. COLEMAN: -- and this lawsuit seeks the\nbailout and the declaratory judgment that if we cannot\nbail out --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You separately asked for\ndeclaratory judgment?\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes. There are different\nclaims in the lawsuit, Your Honor. And indeed, the\nstanding point is--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't challenge -- if\nyou have bailout, say we accept your reading of the\nstatute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of\nthe act if it matched your obligation to preclear with\nthe right to bail out.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, that's not exactly right\neither, Justice Ginsburg. We certainly contest and\ncontend that preclearance is unconstitutional. We\nacknowledge that if the Court were to give us bailout\nthat the Court might choose on its own not to reach the\nconstitutional issues because we would receive relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- I thought I just\nheard you say even if you got the bailout the extension\nfor another 25 years would still be unconstitutional.\nIs that -- or are you saying that the accommodation, the\nmodification, would suffice to make the statute\nconstitutional?\nMR. COLEMAN: No. We do not say that the\nmodification would make the statute constitutional. Our\nposition is both that we are entitled to bailout and we\nhave an alternative claim that we have asserted that is\nindependent, it's not dependent on the first one, that\npreclearance is unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well Mr. Coleman, this is\nimportant to me. Do you -- do you acknowledge that if\nwe find on your favor on the bailout point we need not\nreach the constitutional point?\nMR. COLEMAN: I do acknowledge that, Justice\nSouter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably you\nwouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't\nbe subject to the preclearance requirement.\nMR. COLEMAN: Right. But because we had all\nthe claims together in one lawsuit, we had to assert\nthem all together, and that's what we've done.\nGetting to the heart of this preclearance\nissue, if I may, Katzenbach recognized that preclearance\nreally was an extraordinary remedy and it recognized\nthat is a remedy that would not otherwise be appropriate\nbut for the extraordinary emergency circumstances that\nexisted at the time. Nobody has challenged that. But\nwe are in a different day. The kinds of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Coleman, may I just\nraise a basic point here. And I'll be candid with you\nthat it affects my view of your argument. I just want\nto start with it. Your argument is largely based on the\nassumption that things have significantly changed and\nthat therefore Congress could not by whatever test we\nuse extend the -- extend section 5.\nBut what we've got in the record in front of\nus -- I don't have a laundry list to read, but I mean,\nwe've got I think at the present time a 6-point -- a\n16-point registration difference on Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic white voters in Texas. We've got a record\nof some 600 interpositions by the -- by the Justice\nDepartment on section 5 proceedings, section 5\nobjections, over a period of about 20 years. We got a\nrecord that about two-thirds of them were based on the\nJustice Department's view that it was intentional\ndiscrimination. We've got something like 600 section 2\nlawsuits over the same period of time.\nThe point that I'm getting at is I don't\nunderstand, with a record like that, how you can\nmaintain as a basis for this suit that things have\nradically changed. They may be better. But to say that\nthey have radically changed to the point that this\nbecomes an unconstitutional section 5 exercise within\nCongress's judgment just seems to me to -- to deny the\nempirical reality. I mean, what it your answer to that?\nMR. COLEMAN: Our answer, Your Honor, is --\nis a very clear one and that is there is a difference\nbetween a nondiscrimination statute and a\nnoncircumvention statute. Section 2, section 203, the\nprohibition on the uses of tests and devices, these are\nclear nondiscrimination provisions that are textually\nlinked back to the -- to the constitutional\nprohibitions. Section 5 was never intended to be a\nnondiscrimination statute. Section 5 is a\nnoncircumvention statute, notwithstanding the volume --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the evidence that\nI've been getting into is a pretty good indication -- I\nwould have thought Congress thought so and I would have\nthought so too -- that there is something to be\nconcerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in\nfact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to\nrender circumvention irrelevant.\nMR. COLEMAN: I honestly disagree with you,\nJustice Souter, on that. Notwithstanding --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was -- but\nthere was -- Congress fastened on that issue and it\nreferred to second generation discrimination, which is a\nfrequent pattern with discrimination. You start with\nthe blatant overt discrimination, and then in time\npeople recognize that that's -- that won't go any more,\nso the discrimination becomes more subtle, less easy to\nsmoke out. But it doesn't go from blatant overt\ndiscrimination to everything is equal.\nMR. COLEMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the Court in\nKatzenbach recognized that Congress had been trying for\nseveral years to try to fix this problem and it walked\nthrough, as this Court has walked through innumerable\ntimes, that section 5 is simply not about\nnondiscrimination, but it was about the unremitting and\ningenious defiance of statutes in a way that made\nordinary enforcement mechanisms, including litigation,\nsimply ineffective, that no matter what the courts did,\nin the South the enforcement mechanisms were unable to\nallow minority individuals to register and get out and\nvote, that no matter what happened -- preclearance put a\nstop to that.\nBut notwithstanding this record, which I'd\nlike to speak to the volume of separately --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'll ask you that\nquestion because I'd like to hear your answer to that.\nMR. COLEMAN: Notwithstanding that record,\nit is not the kind of record -- Congress put together\nwhat it believed was a discrimination record, but not a\ncircumvention record. There is no indication, for\ninstance, in these types of examples that have been\noffered in the briefs and were offered in the\ncongressional hearings that these aren't things that can\nbe fixed through ordinary enforcement mechanisms through\nsection 2 litigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you take the\nmultiple devices -- take the one as simple as moving the\nelection day so that it will coincide with the -- with\nthe holiday of a predominantly minority college. To go\nafter every change of that order with a section 2\nlawsuit -- of the two devices, surely section 5 is more\neffective to smoke that out.\nMR. COLEMAN: Two points on that, Justice\nGinsburg. First, with respect to the Waller County\nissue, that was an issue that was very swiftly addressed\nby Texas officials itself in cooperation with the NAACP.\nThe Texas secretary of state and the Texas attorney\ngeneral came down very swiftly on that issue. The\nsecond point is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps they -- perhaps\nthey wouldn't if the only tool in the arsenal were\nsection 2, if everything had to be a Federal lawsuit.\nMR. COLEMAN: And that gets at the heart of\none of our arguments, Justice Ginsburg. That is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you this question\nfor a second, please? And just take 2 minutes to answer\nit or not. You don't have to answer it, but it seems to\nme this is the question. This whole issue depends on\nthe evidence before Congress. So, in reading the\nbriefs, I have six categories of evidence. Compared to\nthe City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two\nStates, Virginia and Texas, with significant\ndisparities.\nAs to minority officeholders, there is a big\nimprovement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana,\nand South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still\nnot great.\nThe DOJ objections: The number of DOJ\nobjections has fallen a lot, but it still exists.\nIn terms of election observers, which were\nnot mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics\nthat two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of\nthe six States that are covered. In terms of\npolarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have\ntestimony that the polarization is significant and\ncommon in certain places.\nAnd as to successful section 2, section 5\nsuits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but\nsince 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5\nsuits and 653 successful section 2 suits. All right.\nI just summarized that because I'd like to\nhear in a couple of minutes, or five, or whatever you\nwant to take. I'm trying to lead you to what I think is\nthe heart of the case. It seems evidentiary. That is\nwhat I read. What is your response?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, I'm obviously not going\nto have time to respond to all of that, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Whatever you want.\nMR. COLEMAN: But, for instance, with\nrespect to the first point that you raised, which is\nvoter registration and turnout issues, those numbers\ndon't tell the whole story. In fact -- in fact, with\nrespect to both black and Hispanic voters, the record in\ncovered jurisdictions is above the national average.\nMassachusetts, for instance, you might be learned to\nknow, has a white-black voter registration and turnout\ndifferential that is in the high 20s, far in excess of\nany covered jurisdiction. And that's part of what\nCongress didn't do.\nSo in addition to the argument we have that the\nrecord Congress produced is really a nondiscrimination\nrecord and not a circumvention record, we also have the\nargument that we've made that it is simply irrational\nfor Congress to go back and say the Voting Rights Act of\n1965 was intended to make sure that minority voters\ncould register and vote and that's going to be our\nnumber one priority.\nAs Justice Ginsburg recognized, Congress\nbelieves that that has been satisfied. But now we are\ngoing to go back and in determining who's going to be\ncovered under the 2006 amendment, we are going to use\nthe same data from the 1964 election.\nIt would have been as if Congress in 1965\nsaid: We anticipate that there are problems here; and,\nin order to define coverage, we are going to look at the\nRoosevelt-Hoover election in 1932 and registration and\nturnout then, because we think that is the best way to\nevaluate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Breyer --\nJustice Breyer did refer you to some other more current\nstatistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth.\nYou might want to address those. And in that context,\nwas there any control data to compare preclearance rates\nor preclearance events in colored -- in covered\njurisdictions as opposed to uncovered jurisdictions?\nMR. COLEMAN: That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that -- that's part of\nthe showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to\nmake, that these States that are now covered and that\nwere covered are markedly different from the noncovered\njurisdictions. Was there anything in the record before\nthe Congress or the district court to address that\npoint?\nMR. COLEMAN: The only comparative data that\nexisted was of two kinds. There was a -- there was a --\nsome data that grouped all covered jurisdictions into\none lump and all noncovered jurisdictions into another\nlump and counted up section 2 lawsuits. And the\ndifference was about 17 successful -- 17 more successful\nsection 2 suits in covered jurisdictions than in\nnoncovered jurisdictions. That's not a big difference.\nWhat Congress didn't do, though, is look at\nspecific noncovered jurisdictions, for instance, the\nones I've cited, and say, how do these compare to\ncovered jurisdictions?\nAnd the other thing it didn't do is say:\nAmong covered jurisdictions and noncovered\njurisdictions, let's look among -- let's separate out\namong these jurisdictions and see where the problem\nlocations are and what areas we think might, if -- if\npreclearance is going to be constitutional, might be\nsubject. There is absolutely no evidence in the record\nof that. Preclearance once again is based on the\nresults -- well, whether there was a test or device in\nthe 1960s and the results of the 1964, 1968, and 1972\npresidential elections.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of coverage\nformula would be adequate? You are attacking Congress'\npreservation of the same coverage formula. But what\nother coverage formula could it come up with?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, just to give one example\n-- and I'm not -- not recommending this -- but if, for\ninstance, the same coverage formula had been applied to\nthe 2000 and 2004 elections, equalizing for citizen\nvoting age population, the only covered State would have\nbeen Hawaii. Under that formula, using modern data,\nmodern information, none of these States would have been\ncovered if you account for noncitizen voting age\npopulation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was -- and maybe\nthe government will refer to it -- I thought, quite a\nbit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this\nrecord.\nMR. COLEMAN: I wouldn't say quite a bit,\nYour Honor. What it did is it lumped all covered\njurisdictions together and all noncovered jurisdictions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you said all that\nthere was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think\nthere was quite a bit more than that.\nMR. COLEMAN: I -- I actually dispute that.\nThere is a lot of discussion of that information, Your\nHonor, but it's not that much information. And, again\nit doesn't -- it doesn't take into account any attempt\nto say: How does the panhandle of Texas do against\nFlorida, against parts of northeast Georgia or northwest\nAlabama? How are these -- it makes no attempt\nwhatsoever. It is simply all covered jurisdictions as a\nlump and all noncovered jurisdictions as a lump, and\nCongress had no basis to make that -- that declaration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In your -- in your answer\nyou said if they used the 2004 the only State would be\nHawaii. But I asked you what formula would pass if\nCongress wants to get at -- wants to protect the gains\nthat have been made but are still fragile against\nbacksliding? If that's its objective, what can it\ncover?\nMR. COLEMAN: It needed to make an\nevaluation of where there is an actual risk of\nbacksliding and where there is actual evidence of\ncircumvention. We don't believe that. We don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about the evidence\nthat Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to? I\nmean those -- that is simply evidence of racial attitude\nand it seems to me in the real world that can be taken\nas evidence that if the -- if the section 5 safeguard is\ntaken away, the pushback is going to start.\nMR. COLEMAN: That evidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It has never stopped.\nMR. COLEMAN: That evidence justifies strict\nenforcement of nondiscrimination statutes, but it does\nnot justify a presumption that State and local officials\nin these areas are so racist that they cannot be relied\non to pass and enforce fair voting laws.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They couldn't -- they\ncouldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases\nin which the voting change was withdrawn after DOJ\nobjection.\nMR. COLEMAN: Again, this -- this\ninformation that goes out over 30 years and across\nthousands upon thousands of jurisdictions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: This wasn't information\nover 30 years. My recollection -- and I could be wrong\non this, but my recollection is that those were\nstatistics from about 20 years prior to the\nreauthorization.\nMR. COLEMAN: From -- from 1982 forward.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, that's correct.\nMR. COLEMAN: So you have 25 years across\nthousands of jurisdictions. But the objection rate is\non the order of single digits per 10,000 submissions.\nIt simply as a matter of comparison with 1965 doesn't\nwork.\nMay I reserve the rest of my time, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Coleman.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE HOLDER\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAnd let me begin where Mr. Coleman left off,\nbecause I don't think that his argument adequately\ngrapples either with this Court's consistent upholding\nof the provision at issue 4 times over 4 decades or with\nCongress's action in 2006. Congress's reauthorization\nin 2006 was the paradigmatic attempt of what to do in\nCongress. It didn't redefine a rate, nor did it cast\naspersions at Supreme Court doctrine. Rather, it took\nthat doctrine seriously, both this Court's teachings\nwith respect to the Voting Rights Act specifically, as\nwell as the -- as the scope of the Congress's\nReconstruction enforcement powers, and arrived at a\nconsidered judgment.\nAfter 16,000 pages of testimony, 21\ndifferent hearings over 10 months, Congress looked at\nthe evidence and determined that their work was not\ndone.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the -- the\n-- our -- our decision in City of Boerne said that\naction under section 5 has to be congruent and\nproportional to what it's trying to remedy. Here, as I\nunderstand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the\nsubmissions are not precleared. That, to me, suggests\nthat they are sweeping far more broadly than they need\nto, to address the intentional discrimination under the\nFifteenth Amendment.\nMR. KATYAL: I -- I disagree with that,\nMr. Chief Justice. I think what that represents is that\nsection 5 is actually working very well; that it\nprovides a deterrent. This was a debate in Congress.\nIndeed, Mr. Coleman himself testified before Congress\nand said the low objection rate is evidence that it\nisn't congruent to proportional.\nThe Congress disagreed with that. What it\nfound instead was that section 5 was deterring the\nproblem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's like\nthe old -- you know, it's the elephant whistle. You\nknow, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants.\nYou know, well, that's silly. Well, there are no\nelephants, so it must work.\nI mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these\nbeing precleared, why isn't that reaching far too\nbroadly.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, let me suggest another\nexample. Yesterday the Administrative Office for the\nUnited States Courts said there were approximately\n17,500 requests for Title 3 wiretaps in the past 10\nyears. Four of them had been rejected. That's a .023\npercent rejection rate.\nBut I don't think one could use those\nnumbers and say, oh, that means that Title 3 doesn't\ndeter or prevent abusive wiretaps. What it suggests\ninstead, if Congress would have found -- I agree that if\nwe were just standing up with no record whatsoever,\nthat's one thing, but if Congress heard testimony, they\nfound example after example of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, the parallel -- the\nparallel isn't there. I mean, there are laws against\nintentional discrimination. So there should be laws\nagainst wiretapping. There should also be laws against\nintentional discrimination. But where the -- the\nargument here is not that those laws be eliminated.\nIt's just that the preclearance requirements be\neliminated.\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And Congress found\nwith respect to those intentional -- laws that prevent\nintentional vote discrimination, which is section 2,\nwhich you hear Mr. Coleman relying on today, that that\nis ineffective for the same reasons that this Court has\nfound them repeatedly in South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\nin City of Rome.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A long time ago. How much\nof the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically\ncircumvention evidence?\nMR. KATYAL: Quite a bit of evidence about\nthe ineffectiveness of section 2 as a remedy. So -- and\nthe statement for the intervenors -- there's a 500-page\nstatement filed before the district court which excerpts\nthe congressional record. In the pages 270 to 279 you\nsee a long series of -- a long analysis by Congress\nabout how section 2 is ineffective, that it costs too\nmuch to bring the litigation, that there are few\nattorneys that will handle it, that -- that there isn't\nenough money and that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if section 2 is\nineffective, then why didn't Congress extend section 5\nto the entire country? Could Congress have reauthorized\nsection 5 without identifying significant differences\nbetween the few jurisdictions that are covered and the\nrest of the country?\nMR. KATYAL: I don't believe so. I think\nCongress had to make some showing. And here there are\nexplicit legislative findings that say that section 5 is\nneeded in these areas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not comparative, however.\nNot comparative with the rest of the country except\nin -- in --\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I disagree with that for\nseveral reasons. First of all, and most I think what\nthis utility district can argue about is Texas, and\nCongress found very specific evidence about\ndiscrimination in the State of Texas. They found that\nthey led the country in the number of objections. They\nfound that the -- that the registration rates, as\nJustice Souter said, between Hispanics and whites was\ngreat.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it's 18 percent. If\nthese statistics are correct, the difference between\nLatino registration and white registration in Texas was\n18.6 percent, which is not good, but it's substantially\nlower than the rate in California, which is not covered,\n37 percent; Colorado, 28 percent; New Mexico, 24\npercent; the nationwide average, 30 percent.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, again, I think that what\nCongress found is that the rate in Texas coupled with\nits historical amount of discrimination together\njustified -- justified the reauthorization of section 5.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me focus\non that historical aspect. Obviously no one doubts the\nhistory here and that the history was different. But at\nwhat point does that history seek -- stop justifying\naction with respect to some jurisdictions but not with\nrespect to others that show greater disparities?\nMR. KATYAL: Again, I think what this Court\nhas -- has answered that question in Katzenbach by\nsaying it may be the case that there are other\njurisdictions discriminate more, Congress can deal with\nthe problem one step at a time. And the -- and Congress\nhas said that the Court should be particularly worried\nabout trying to predict the future and say that\ndiscrimination is now over. We have fairly good --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so your answer\nis that Congress can impose this disparate treatment\nforever because of the history in the south?\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When can they --\nwhen can they -- when do they have to stop?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, Congress here said 25\nyears was -- 25 years was the appropriate\nreauthorization period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they said five\nyears originally and then another 20 years. I mean, at\nsome point it begins to look like the idea is that this\nis going to go on forever.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, again, if Congress can't\nmake the findings, then I think this Court would be well\nwithin its powers to -- to strike it down. But here the\nCourt is being asked to do something that has never been\ndone before, which is to use its Fifteenth -- to say\nthat Congress exceeded the balance of its Fifteenth\nAmendment powers and its Fourteenth Amendment powers in\nan area involving race and voting. That has never\nhappened before.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the burden that\nthe Act puts on the State irrelevant consideration?\nMR. KATYAL: It certainly is. We don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How many people in the\nDepartment of Justice -- what's the Department of\nJustice budget for preclearance processes each year, do\nyou know?\nMR. KATYAL: I don't know what the budget\nis. I can tell you there are -- there are approximately\n30 attorneys who work in the voting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thirty attorneys. Do you\nquarrel with the assessment -- the testimony before the\nSenate Judiciary Committee that it costs the States and\nthe municipalities a billion dollars over 10 years to\ncomply?\nMR. KATYAL: Again, I don't quarrel with\nthat, but Congress certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you think that is --\nthat is relevant?\nMR. KATYAL: I -- I certainly think the\nburden on the States is relevant. Also relevant is the\nfact that the States are now not coming before the Court\nand objecting the way they were in South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But yet -- yet the\nCongress has made a finding that the sovereignty of\nGeorgia is less than the sovereign dignity of Ohio. The\nsovereignty of Alabama, is less than the sovereign\ndignity of Michigan. And the governments in one are to\nbe trusted less than the governments than the other.\nAnd does the United States take that position today?\nMR. KATYAL: I wouldn't put it at all in\nthose terms. I would say what Congress found is that\nthere is a historical amount of discrimination coupled\nwith recent evidence and comparative data between\ncovered and noncovered jurisdictions that justifies\ncontinuation of a remedy that States now overwhelmingly\nappreciate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then my point\nstands. You say that there is a basis for treating\nStates quite differently as to the -- this fundamental\nright that we all agree on with respect to voting. And\nwhat's happened in part is that because of section 5\npreclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is\nprotected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered\njurisdictions.\nMR. KATYAL: But -- but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is -- this is a great\ndisparity in treatment, and the government of the United\nStates is saying that our States must be treated\ndifferently. And you have a very substantial burden if\nyou're going to make that case.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, their burden\nis the same as it has always been in South Carolina\nversus Katzenbach and City of Rome. The burden is on\nCongress to say is continuation of this landmark\nachievement, one of the most transformative acts in\nAmerican history, still justified, because with this act\nwhat Congress -- what Congress did was essentially\nredeem itself in the eyes of the world.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No one -- no one questions\nthe validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the\nVoting Rights Act. The question is whether or not it\nshould be continued with this differentiation between\nthe States. And that is for Congress to show.\nMR. KATYAL: And Congress did show precisely\nthat. They showed, for example, Justice Kennedy,\nthat -- that the differential between covered and\nnoncovered States with respect to section 2 lawsuits was\n57 percent of successful section 2 lawsuits were filed\nin covered jurisdictions, even though they are 25\npercent of the population --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why didn't\nCongress then extend the Act to Massachusetts, whereas\nyour brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions\nthat are covered?\nMR. KATYAL: Because that -- because, again,\nthat is only one aspect of the overall problem, the\namount of registration rates or something like that.\nWhat Congress has historically done ever since the\ninception of the Voting Rights Act is target those\nStates where discrimination is so rooted that it is hard\nto get rid of without preclearance.\nPreclearance will transform the landscape\nand enfranchise millions of Americans. And Congress\nheard evidence and said, after 16,000 pages of\ntestimony, that the extension in these specific areas\nwas necessary in order to root out and prevent\ndiscriminatory changes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't you agree that\nthere is some oddities in this coverage formula?\nIsn't -- is it not the case that in New York City the\nBronx is covered and Brooklyn and Queens are not?\nMR. KATYAL: There -- there -- there are\ncertainly some oddities, as there always have been, from\nKatzenbach and from City of Rome. And what this Court\nhas said is that Congress can act on the state-by-state\nlevel and -- and that there is a remedy for the problem,\nwhich is the bailout provision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, let's talk about the\nbailout provision. That -- that was inserted in 1982.\nMR. KATYAL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many years is that?\nOver a quarter of a century, there have been 15 bailouts\nthat have gone through? All of them in the State of\nVirginia?\nMR. KATYAL: There -- there have been 18\nunder the new provision, which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You bring this before us as\na justification for the legislation.\nMR. KATYAL: I am saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's obviously quite\nimpracticable --\nMR. KATYAL: Again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for anybody to bail out.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that precise\nargument was made to Congress in 2006 and it was\nrejected. And it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question is whether\nit's right, not whether Congress rejected it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATYAL: And I think it's not right\nbecause what the testimony found was that States are\nable to bail out, but they don't, and this goes back to\nmy point to Justice Kennedy, because today States are\nfinding that preclearance actually serves their\ninterests; it increases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It fends off Section 2\nsuits, I assume. I mean, that's great. You get a\ndeclaratory judgment, here -- you know, a benediction,\nand you skip off without having to face suits. That may\nbe one reason. Another reason may be that they like the\npacking of minorities and the other -- the other\ndistricting tricks that can be -- that can be pulled\nbecause - because of the requirements of the Voting\nRights Act.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I don't think that's a\nquite fair characterization. After all, here, Congress\nin 2006 -- all Senators voted for this bill, and indeed\n90 of the 110 Representatives from covered jurisdictions\nvoted for it, so if the Court is concerned about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they get elected\nunder this system. Why should that they take it away?\nMR. KATYAL: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I say, everybody who voted\nfor this -- this system was elected under this system.\nShould it be surprising that they think it it's a good\nthing?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think that we shouldn't\n-- this Court should be loathe to second-guess the\nmotivations of Congress under --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have -- we have before\nus the representations of the county in which the\ndistrict is located, and of several of the covered\njurisdictions, that they don't seek bailout because they\nthink that the benefits, many of which have nothing to\ndo with districting, outweigh whatever burden\npreclearance puts on them. It's first, bringing\nminority groups into the discussion of what the change\nwill be in the first place, and then warding off the\nkind of examples that appear in the -- in the Louis -- I\nthink we -- we can't impugn their integrity by saying\nthat that host of reasons, having nothing to do with\nredistricting, is why they are not asking for bailout.\nMR. KATYAL: That's precisely right, Justice\nGinsburg, and what the covered jurisdictions also say is\nsomething about how this -- the test before this Court\nshouldn't be the narrowest time slice of today, but\nrather the test should be to think about historically\nwhat has happened.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are not insisting that\nthey -- the other side is not insisting that they be\nkicked out. If they want to voluntarily stay in, fine.\nIn fact, you should let other States and other\njurisdiction opt in if they want to.\nMR. KAYTAL: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you want to make this a\nvoluntary system that's something entirely different,\nbut the question is assuming a State or -- or a covered\njurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the\nright to coerce them to be in? That's all we are\ntalking about.\nMR. KAYTAL: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they want to stay in,\nthat's fine.\nMR. KATYAL: And this Court has recognized\nand the brief of the covered jurisdictions recognizes\nthe fact that it's a separate sovereign requiring in\nthis provides an additional deterrent element and\nincreases the integrity of the elections.\nIf I could return to the point I was saying\na moment ago, what these covered jurisdictions are\nsaying is that this moment in time isn't the right test.\nRather you should look at the overall historical\nrecord --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the overall\nhistorical record, Katzenbach said there had been\nunremitting and ingenious defiance, and that was\ncertainly true as of the time of the Voting Rights Act.\nDemocracy was a shambles in those -- that's not true\nanymore, and to say that the States are willing to yield\ntheir sovereign authority and their sovereign\nresponsibilities to govern themselves doesn't work.\nWe've said in Clinton s New York that\nCongress can't surrender its powers to the President,\nand the same is true with reference to the States.\nWouldn't you agree?\nMR. KATYAL: That is correct. And here this\nCourt has repeatedly said this isn't any sort of\nsurrendering of power. It was justified because of the\nrecord of discrimination. South Carolina v Katzenbach,\nJustice Kennedy, I don't quite think said that defiance\nwas the precondition; rather it found that the onerous\namount of case-by-case litigation itself wasn't enough.\nAnd I would caution this Court because this Court has\nhad examples before in which the historical record\nlooked good at a narrow moment in time. If we think\nback 100 years to Reconstruction, 95 percent of\nAfrican-Americans in franchise, 600 black members in the\nState legislatures, 8 black members of Congress, 8 black\njustice in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Things\nlooked good, and that led this Court in the civil rights\ncases over Justice Harlan's lone dissent to say the era\nof special protection was over.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this\nquestion about -- about bailout? I mean we have --\nthere's a very odd aspect to this case. We have an\nimmense constitutional question and then on the other\nhand you have this little utility district, which -- and\nyou'll correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I got from\nthe briefs, they have never done anything wrong, and\nthey would like to bail out and the Voting Rights Act\nwas intended to permit jurisdictions that were not\ncommitting transgressions to bail out. Now if the\nstatute doesn't allow them to do it, the statute doesn't\nallow them to do it, but is there any good reason why a\ndistrict like that should not be permitted to bail out?\nMR. COLEMAN: Again, this Court has\nrepeatedly said that this Congress, of the United\nStates, can legislate on the State-by-State level.\nAfter all, the text of the Fifteenth Amendment speaks of\n\"any State.\" So I think the relevant test is the amount\nof discrimination in Texas, and there the evidence is\nnot just registration rates; it's the fact that they\nlead the country in objections under section 5, that the\ngreatest deterrent effect of the more information\nprocess is in the State of Texas.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it's the case that there\nis no discrimination going on, no evasion going on in\nthis little utility district, is there any good reason\nwhy they shouldn't be able to bail out?\nMR. KATYAL: Yes, absolutely, because that's\nwhat City of Rome argued in 1980, and what this Court\nsaid in rejecting precisely that argument over Justice\nPowell's dissent, was that it's not that discrimination\ncan't be to be at the individual unit-by-unit level. It\nrather, if Congress so chooses, can do it on a more\nbroad level.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was 1980?\nMR. KATYAL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The bailout provision was\nadopted in 1982, 27 years ago. There have been 15\nbailouts since then. Is that what you think Congress\ncontemplated when it enacted the bailout provision in\n1982?\nMR. KATYAL: First of all there was a\nbailout provision at issue in 1980. It was amended in\n1982. And yes, I think Congress contemplated a process\n-- the legislative record on this is very clear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Less than one a year?\nMR. KAYTAL: -- that -- no, what they\ncontemplated was to make it easier for political\ndivisions to bail out, and what Congress --- what\nCongress anticipated, certainly more than one a year,\nthat didn't materialize. And again, I think, Justice\nScalia, the reason why it didn't materialize is because\nStates generally -- general appreciate Section 5's\npreclearance process as well as its -- covered\njurisdictions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I thought\n-- I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the\nproblem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be\nwidespread and persisting. Do you think the record that\nis before us today shows widespread and persisting\ndiscrimination in voting?\nMR. KATYAL: I do. I think that Congress,\nCongress' reports, it's 16,000-page track record --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In covered States as\nopposed to noncovered States, if I can add that to the\nChief Justice's question, please.\nMR. KATYAL: I do agree that they went State\nby State and showed -- showed tremendous amounts of\ndiscrimination in those places. Of course I disagree\nwith the notion that this utility district can point to\nany one place in the country, be it Massachusetts or\nsome corner in Georgia, and say well, the evidence\nwasn't there. I think Congress has far more latitude\nunder its Fifteenth and Fourteenth Amendment powers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just one thing on bailout.\nIt's like Eurystheus keeps telling Hercules, \"Oh, you\ndid a good job, but now you've got another -- got\nanother thing to do.\" That's the bailout provision.\nAnybody who has tried to fill out a government form\nrealizes they make a mistake, so that the DOJ rejects\nit, that counts as a rejection. You have to have a --\nwhat, a clean record for how many -- how many years --\nbefore you can preclear? I mean, this is simply\nimpracticable. And it seems to me a cornerstone of the\nAct and of your argument for upholding the Act, and if\nwe find that it doesn't work, that it's just -- it's\njust an illusion, that gives me serious pause.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, the only\nevidence in the record is that the bailout provision\nworks nothing like the way that it might be\nhypothesized. That is, every single county, every\nsingle political subdivision that has asked for a\nbailout has received one, and in 2006 there was an even\namendment offered to minimize the bailout provision.\nThat amendment was rejected overwhelmingly, and the\nreason it was rejected was that jurisdictions that are\ncovered have now come to appreciate the power of Section\n5 to deter voting discrimination, and that's why\nCongress made a judgment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I understand it, is\nthis incorrect? As I understand it for Travis County to\nget a bailout, it would -- it has within Travis County\nsomething like 106 political subdivisions that are\ncovered, and Travis County would have to go to all of\nthose 106 and demonstrate that there has been no\nviolation by any of those 106 for the preceding whatever\nit is, five years, whatever the bailout provision is.\nYou think that's -- you think that's\nfeasible?\nMR. KATYAL: For the way the statute works,\nthey have to go to the 107 subunits, which is absolutely\nfeasible because they are under contract with all 107\nsubunits to administer their elections. They have all\nof the voting data to put together that bailout, and in\nprevious --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Travis County is not the\nsuperior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this\ndistrict here. This district is a subdivision of the\nState, but not of Travis County.\nMR. KATYAL: Again, I think that's a\ndistinction without a difference. They have all of the\nregistration data and everything else necessary to make\nthe bailout provision. And the only record Congress and\nthe only record before this Court is that every single\nentity that has sought a bailout has received one.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the number is 18 now?\nMR. KATYAL: The number is 18.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Adegbile.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBO P. ADEGBILE\nON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENOR-APPELLEES\nMR. ADEGBILE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOur long experience demonstrates that racial\ndiscrimination in voting has been persistent and\nadaptive. Only after careful assessment of the record\ndid Congress find that the case-by-case method was\ninadequate and that section 5 continued to do important\nwork within the covered jurisdictions.\nThere are a couple of things that I want to\ncall the Court's attention to in light of the discussion\nthat we've been having. First, the pernicious nature of\nvoting discrimination is such that small changes in the\nrules of the game can affect many people. In addition,\nthe Court has observed, as Congress has on multiple\noccasions when reauthorizing the Act, that the\ncase-by-case method is slow and inadequate to the task.\nIndeed, Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boerne spoke to\nthis problem of the case-by-case method.\nI want to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's absolutely\nright. Section 2 cases are very expensive. They are\nvery long. They are very inefficient. I think this\nsection 5 preclearance device has -- has shown -- has\nbeen shown to be very very successful. The question is\nwhether or not it can be justified when other States are\nnot covered today.\nMR. ADEGBILE: As -- as the Court said in\nKatzenbach when it first was presented with this\nquestion of the coverage formula, Congress is permitted\nto use so much of its power as is necessary to target\nthe problem as it finds it. The discrimination that was\nmanifest in the covered jurisdictions was different in\ncharacter at that time and -- but Congress did not stop\nand get frozen in time in 1965. The periodic\nreauthorizations have given Congress an opportunity to\nrevisit the progress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it your -- is\nit your position that today southerners are more likely\nto discriminate than northerners?\nMR. ADEGBILE: I wouldn't frame it in that\nway, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts. I think the\nrecord does reveal that discrimination in the covered\njurisdictions has a repetitive form. There are very --\nthere are brief talks about over six dozen examples.\nThose are illustrative and not exhaustive, but\nrepetitious violations, that is, violations in covered\njurisdictions after a section 2 case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer is\nyes?\nMR. ADEGBILE: I think that it's fair to say\nthat the pattern has been more repetitious violations in\nthe covered jurisdictions and -- and more one off\ndiscrimination in other places.\nThat is not to say that there isn't voting\ndiscrimination in other States. The record shows that\nthere is discrimination in other States. But the -- but\nCongress found that the nature of the way the\ndiscrimination is practiced, viewed through the lens of\nhistory, is that repetitive violations happen. For\nexample, after this Court decided the LULAC case, a case\nthat was litigated over a number of months and very\nexpensive and complicated, the State then tried to\nshorten the period for early voting. And the plaintiffs\nin that case needed to file a section 5 enforcement\naction, post-2000 redistricting, to give effect to this\nCourt's judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- but I guess\nthat point depends upon the assumption that shortening\nthe time period for early voting is discriminatory as\nopposed to good policy.\nMR. ADEGBILE: I think in the context of\nthat circumstance, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, the\nissue was that you had a long-standing incumbent and\nthat the early voting -- the timing of the early voting\nperiod was such that it was going to conflict with a --\na holiday of -- of a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that was largely\nto protect the incumbent.\nMR. ADEGBILE: To protect the incumbent, but\nto disadvantage the community that was prepared to\nexercise its voice, as this Court found in the LULAC\nopinion. That is to say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, incumbent --\nMR. ADEGBILE: -- the incumbent was not the\ncandidate of choice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Incumbent protection\ntakes place in the North as well as the South.\nMR. ADEGBILE: By all means, but the -- but\nthe incumbent protection in this instance was designed\nto cut off the minority community, the Latino voters who\nhad been disadvantaged by virtue of that plan. But\ncertainly that is not the only example.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Adegbile, what was -- I\nread it in the briefs, and I forget what it was. What\nwas the vote on this 2006 extension -- 98 to nothing in\nthe Senate, and what was it in the House? Was --\nMR. ADEGBILE: It was -- it was 33 to 390, I\nbelieve.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 33 to 390. You know, the\n-- the Israeli Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin, used to\nhave a rule that if the death penalty was pronounced\nunanimously, it was invalid, because there must be\nsomething wrong there. Do you ever expect -- do you\never seriously expect Congress to vote against a\nreextension of the Voting Rights Act? Do you really\nthink that any incumbent would -- would vote to do that?\nMR. ADEGBILE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty-five years from now?\nFifty years from now? When?\nMR. ADEGBILE: Justice Scalia, I think some\nmembers of Congress did of course vote against the Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thirty-three members of the\nHouse and nobody in the Senate.\nMR. ADEGBILE: Thirty-three members of the\nHouse, indeed. But I think the -- the reason that they\nvoted for it is what's more important. Congress did not\nassume that section 5 was necessary. It took a very\ncareful examination to see how it was operating, and the\ndetermination was that in the absence of section 5,\nbecause of the repetitive violations, because of 620\nobjections -- there was evidence that approximately 60\npercent of those show some evidence of intentional\ndiscrimination.\nIf you take away the prophylaxis, the\ndiscrimination will return in a way that we don't need\nto revisit. The history has been that voting\ndiscrimination manifests itself through repetitive\nefforts and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, do\nyou agree that this is unlike access to buildings by\npeople who are in wheelchairs? There has to come a\npoint where it will end, and perhaps Congress was just\npicking up on what this court said a few years before in\nthe University of Michigan law school case, this court\ncame up with a 25-year figure so maybe Congress thought\nthis court thinks 25 years is about right, must be about\nright.\nMR. ADEGBILE: Congress had a more specific\nreason as I understand the record. There was a specific\namendment proposed to shorten the time to 10 years.\nThen Chairman of the judiciary committee James\nSensenbrenner rose to it explain part of the experience\nmost of the infractions not all but most when many\nvoting changes are necessary through reapportionment.\nNot all of them involved reapportionment but many of\nthem are necessitated and the judgment was that it was\ngoing to capture two censuses and they also looked back\nto see how much discrimination they found from 1962 to\nreauthorization.\nAnd indeed Congress has been a little bit\nsurprised they have not been able to dislodge more of\nthe discrimination. They acknowledged the progress.\nProgress didn't happen by itself and the experience had\nbeen that it was helping us to move forward and that is\nreflected I think in the State's brief to come to\nJustice Kennedy's point. I think there is an intrusion.\nThis Court's decisions have recognized that Section 5\ndoes intrude but even in Bernie as the court\ndistinguished Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act from\nthe, many of the statutes that were there at issue in\nthis case, RFRA, certainly other cases followed, the\ncourt kept returning to section 5 because the problem\nhad been demonstrated by Congress. The gravity of the\nharm was so severe that Congress needed a special\nmechanism to dislodge it because if we don't have the\nvote as this court's decisions have recognized, our\nwhole system is undermined.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is the reason in\nyour opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence\nor two, you would say that the reason that Congress\ndidn't go into other States and decide which ones to add\nto this or go into these States district by district and\ndecide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that\nCongress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply\nrenewed it?\nMR. ADEGBILE: Is that it wanted to stay the\ncourse of ridding the covered jurisdictions from\ndiscrimination. Katzenbach spoke in items of the case.\nSubsequent have spoke about ridding the country of this\nscourge as it manifested itself in the covered\njurisdictions and I think this was some State-by-State\nanalysis and the reports of the covered jurisdictions\nthat do it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you say from your\nexperience and I'm sure you're very knowledgeable about\nthis that there is no great are discrimination in voting\nin Virginia than in North Carolina or in Tennessee or in\nArkansas or in Ohio?\nMR. ADEGBILE: I can't precisely quantify\nthe quantum of discrimination in each of those stays but\nI think that Congress' judgment was there had been a\ndemonstrated pattern of discrimination in the covered\njurisdictions, covering formula had --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't Virginia the first\nState in the Union to elect a black governor.\nMR. ADEGBILE: Yes, indeed it was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it has a black chief\njustice of the supreme court currently.\nMR. ADEGBILE: Yes, Justice Scalia, I take\nthe point. But I think it's not quite fair to say. As\nmy predecessor at the podium made the point, that there\nhave been African-Americans to rise to high office\nthroughout our history, but that occasion of a single\nperson sitting in a seat doesn't change the experience\non the ground for everyday citizens.\nIt is -- it has an important salutory effect\nand it tells us about the possibilities of our\nConstitution, but it doesn't mean that voters that are\ntrying to vote in a school board election in Louisiana\nare going to have an easy time of it where racially\npolarized voting is as extreme as it is and when\nelection officials manipulate the rules of the game to\ntry and disadvantage the minority community.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the brief filed by\nthe NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think\nmakes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory\nacts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor\nPercelly, makes an important point about crossovers in\ndifferent -- my concern is it's just not clear to me\nthat Congress addressed this for the rest of the\ncountry. That's my concern.\nMR. ADEGBILE: I think the close -- the best\nevidence of the comparison question to which you're\nreturning is the section 2 cases that were examined in a\nreport that was submitted to Congress. And as\nAppellants recognize in their brief, 600 --\nnotwithstanding the powerful section 5 remedy, there\nwere 653 successful section 2 cases in covered\njurisdictions, and the success rate in covered\njurisdictions was much higher than in noncovered\njurisdictions.\nSo when you put together the objections, the\nrequests for more information followed by withdrawals,\nthe section 5 enforcement actions, the section 2 cases,\nit is a picture that far exceeds the record that was\nbefore this august body when considering enactments of\nCongress in other contexts in Hibbs and in Lane, and the\nrecord was of intentional discrimination, not simply\ndisparities but purposeful efforts to disadvantaged\nminority groups. And I think that's the fundamental\ndifference between the covered jurisdictions and the\nnoncovered.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the cases\nyou're talking about include both intentional and impact\ncases. And the Constitution that section 5 is designed\nto implement covers only intentional discrimination. So\neven the examples you have given sweep broadly as a\nprophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance\nof course sweeps even more broadly. So we do have a\nsituation, despite the evidence that was -- that you\nhave cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent\nof the submissions that the States make are denied\npreclearance.\nAgain, it seems to me that that means that\nsection 5 sweeps very, very broadly.\nMR. ADEGBILE: I think there are two\nresponses. First, the relevant assessment is not simply\nthe rate. As the lower court found, the rate of\nobjections even at the time of the 1975 re-authorization\nin Rome was very small. Judge Tatel spoke to this point\nin his opinion and in the oral argument. The rate has\nalways been small. But what section 5 is designed to do\nis to vindicate the principles of our Constitution, and\nthe gravity of the harm is such that if we have 620\nexamples of discrimination and 60 percent of those are\nintentional discrimination together with some of the\nother indicia and under this Court's cases Congress is\nentitled to look broadly, not simply at the decided\ncase, but to look broadly and to be the factfinder of\nthis important information.\nThis is a pattern. It's a widespread\npattern of intentional discrimination, and I think that\nthat is something that this Court needs to focus on as\nit works through this important and serious issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nI have another question. How long did it\ntake Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?\nMR. ADEGBILE: Approximately 10 months,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how long would it have\ntaken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the\nrecord to figure out what's happening in this respect in\nevery State or in these States district by district?\nMR. ADEGBILE: I think that I can't put a\nprecise time on it, but it would have been certainly a\ncouple more years. The time that is necessary to\ncompile these investigations and the expertise that's\nnecessary to assemble them and cull the data takes some\ntime in my personal experience.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nthat it makes no difference if discrimination in the\nnoncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more\npersistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can\nfocus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered\nsince 1965?\nMR. ADEGBILE: I make a slightly different\npoint. I don't think that it doesn't matter at all. I\nthink Congress has to act reasonably, but in light of\nthe record before it its judgment to stay the course in\nthe covered jurisdictions because of the way voting\ndiscrimination has manifested itself in those\njurisdictions, that judgment is reasonable on the record\nit had before it. It made a judgment in effect that\nsection 2 has proven more adequate to the task in other\njurisdictions that don't have the same history of\nrepetitive violations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess your\nanswer is that they can address the covered\njurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without\nlooking at all to the rest of the country?\nMR. ADEGBILE: I think that if things were\nflipped and discrimination was much worse outside, that\nwould reflect on the reasonableness of Congress'\njudgment. But that's a fact situation that was not\npresent before Congress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. ADEGBILE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Coleman, have\nyou 5 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. COLEMAN: But, as Justice Alito pointed\nout, Congress didn't know, because it didn't ask,\nwhether discrimination is worse in Tennessee or Arkansas\nthan in Virginia and other States. Nobody knows sitting\nhere today.\nI respectfully disagree that Congress\ncouldn't have put together that effort. What we really\ndo hear is that this, this badge that is preclearance,\nthis Congressional judgment that State and local\nofficials in covered jurisdictions who in my experience\nare strongly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You should have a chance to\nanswer the same question. You heard my question, the\ntime question. What's your estimate?\nMR. COLEMAN: Oh, I strongly disagree with\nthat. AEI put in a number of reports that evaluated\nthings on the ground in a variety of noncovered\njurisdictions such as Milwaukee. I certainly think\nwithin the time that Congress took to look at this if\nthey had been interested they could have easily\nevaluated this. It would have been easily available to\nthem.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they now have 25 years\nto look at, or 24 years, to look at the rest of the\ncountry. Are they doing that? Are they holding\nhearings?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, nobody is doing that. In\nanswer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that's what\nCongress did in 1982. It said 25 years. That 25 years\nhas gone by. Times have changed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this Court said --\n-- it was not 1982, it was two thousand something. This\nCourt thought from two thousand something 25 years was a\nreasonable period.\nMR. COLEMAN: Congress' justification simply\ndoes -- I think as we've heard from counsel, in light of\nour mobile society and the fact that people don't live\nin the same place people lived 40 years ago. This is a\nbad --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question\njust as sort of background. Does your case challenge at\nall the standards that Congress has used throughout the\nstatute for causing States to become covered\njurisdictions?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well the only standards that\nexist are whether they use a test or devise in the\n1960s.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. Have you ever\nchallenged those as a basis for making a State or county\nor election district covered?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think we've challenged\nthe action that took place --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you have a history\nthat some States are covered and some are not because of\ncertain requirements that the statute imposed. And I\ndidn't understand the case to involve a challenge to the\nmethod by which States became -- become covered.\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Stevens, we do\nchallenge that. In fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then why is it relevant\nthere are a lot of States out there that are not\ncovered?\nMR. COLEMAN: Because this Court's\ndiscussions of these issues in Morris and in Garrett and\neven in Hibbs indicate that it does matter what the\nevidence shows with respect to a coverage determination,\nand Congress' decision to not update it, which we\nbelieve was for political reasons, simply bears no\nresemblance to reality. And looking back to see who was\nregistered and who was voting in the '60s doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you arguing the\nstatute is unconstitutional because Congress failed to\nextend it to other -- other parts of the country?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, I don't think that's our\nargument. I think our argument is it's partially\nunconstitutional because it even failed to look at the\ncoverage criteria and that it used the criteria\nliterally off the books from the '60s and '70s without\neven looking at the information.\nAgain, if Congress had done that in 1965 and\nsaid, we want to look at this Franklin-Hoover -- excuse\nme -- this Franklin Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932, I\nthink the Court would have been pretty surprised that\nthat was the best and most relevant information that\nCongress could come up with.\nThis idea of -- of a badge that really runs\nwith the land is -- is something that we -- we think is\ninherently unjustifiable.\nI'd also like to address the point about\nracial bloc voting. Racial bloc voting is not\ndiscrimination, and it's not unconstitutional. And,\nindeed, the way the Court has interpreted section 2 --\nand I realize there are divisions in the Court about\nthis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district will -- the\ndistrict will never be involved in racial bloc voting\nfor districting purposes because it doesn't -- it's\nboundaries don't change.\nMR. COLEMAN: That's true, Justice Ginsburg.\nBut in terms of this facial challenge, it is important\nfor the Court to understand and to consider the fact\nthat Congress really thumbed its nose at the Court in\nterms of rejecting the constitutional concerns that the\nCourt raised in -- in Miller and in Bossier Parish and\nin Georgia versus Ashcroft.\nThe new enactment has been changed in a way\nthat -- that really requires covered jurisdictions to\nengage more and more in race-based redistricting and\nrace-based -- and it's not only redistricting, Justice\nGinsburg -- in race-based decisionmaking. And so here\nwe are 40 years --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't one\nconstruing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well,\nCongress obviously had in mind that this would be\nenforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw,\nthis Court's decision in Miller?\nMR. COLEMAN: We believe that the\ninterpretation of the Act or -- excuse me -- the passage\nof the amendments in 2006 go far beyond what\npreclearance was in 1965. We have a more restrictive\nform of preclearance that requires State and local\ngovernments to engage in more, not less, race-based\ndecisionmaking with respect to elections. And that, as\nthe Court has noted, creates additional constitutional\nissues with the Court -- with the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
