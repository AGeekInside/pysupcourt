KOLBO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nJennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher were denied\nadmission to the University of Michigan's flagship\nundergraduate institution, the College of Literature and\nthe Science and the Arts under an admissions-- under\nadmissions policies that facially and flagrantly\ndiscriminated on the basis of race.\nThe history of their case and of the\nUniversity's defense of its discriminatory admissions\npolicies is a powerful argument about the perils of\nentrusting to the discretionary judgments of educators the\nprotection of the Constitution's guarantee of equality to\nall individuals.\nFor nearly 5 years, the University vigorously\ndefended in the district court and the court of appeals\nthe admissions systems that were in place when petitioners\nGratz and Hamacher applied. These systems featured\nseparate admissions guidelines for different races,\nprotected or reserved seats in the class for select\nminorities, that is blacks, Hispanics and Native\nAmericans, racially-segregated wait lists, and a policy of\nnever automatically rejecting students from their\npreferred -- from the preferred minority groups while\ndoing so for others.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Kolbo, as a preliminary\nmatter, would you address the question of whether the\nnamed plaintiff Patrick Hamacher has standing in this\ncase. He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?\nMR. KOLBO: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION:\napply to transfer to the University of Michigan, from\nwherever he was going to school, and yet the transfer\nadmissions policy, I guess isn't before us.\nMR. KOLBO: The transfer admissions policy\nitself is not before you -- the Court, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No\nMR. KOLBO: -- but the policy is essentially the\nsame with respect to the consideration of race and the\nCourt did -- we did certify a class in this case, with\nrespect to Mr. Hamacher, and I believe it was December of\n1998. We moved for class certification and the district\ncourt granted that certification. And as a result of\nthat, of course, anything with respect -- anything that's\nhappened with respect to Mr. Hamacher subsequent to that\ntime it seems to us is not irrelevant to the consideration\nof standing.\nQUESTION: Are you sure that the transfer policy\nis the same as the admissions policy for new freshmen?\nMR. KOLBO: Well, it's not exactly the --\nQUESTION: We didn't find any such finding.\nThere was some little material in the record that gave me\na different thought about it.\nMR. KOLBO: The transfer policy considers race,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION:\nprecisely the same way as this --\nMR. KOLBO: Not in precisely the same way, and\nthe Court -- there -- there is nothing -- it may be,\nperhaps included in parts of the appendix materials, but\nthe district court did not address the issue of the\ntransfer policy in it -- in Mr. Hamacher's potential for\ntransferring under the policy.\nQUESTION: Well, there's nothing, I take it\nif Mr. Hamacher prevails on the transfer -- there is\nnothing in his prevailing that would hurt any other class\nmember.\nMR. KOLBO: Nothing at all, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: It's not a -- okay.\nMR. KOLBO: No. If Mr. Hamacher prevails, then\nthe rights of many thousands of others will have been\nvindicated and they will be able to compete under a non-\ndiscriminatory system.\nQUESTION: Of course that would be true even if\nhe doesn't have standing.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KOLBO: That's true. Well, Your Honor they\nwould not be able to compete under a non-discriminatory\nsystem unless this particular system is struck down.\nQUESTION: I understand if it's struck down, but\nthat -- that begs the question of whether the named\nplaintiff has standing to represent a class of people who\nwant to get into the freshman class. He wants to get in\nas a transferring student. I mean, it -- maybe there's\nstanding, but the mere fact that if he wins everybody will\nbenefit certainly doesn't speak to the question whether he\nhas standing.\nMR. KOLBO: No, Your Honor, but we -- we do\nbelieve that because the -- the transfer policy and the\noriginal admissions policy are fundamentally the same in\nthe respect that they both consider race in the admissions\nprocess in a way that is discriminatory and we believe\nthat's --\nQUESTION: And therefore if you're right that\nany consideration of a race is enough to condemn the\nprogram, then he would have standing, but if it -- if it\nrequires analysis of the particular components of the\npolicy, then we ought to know whether the transfer policy\nis the same as the original policy.\nMR. KOLBO: That would be true, Your Honor, if\nthe case were decided strictly on the issue of narrow\ntailoring, but my understanding is that the University\nconsiders race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that\nwe believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down\nas a rationale, then the law would be same with respect to\nthe transfer policy as with respect to the original\nadmissions policy, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh, he has standing to challenge.\nThat's -- that seems clear, but the -- depending on the\nrationale that the court adopts if it finds -- if it finds\nthe program unacceptable, he may not be entitled to\nrelief.\nMR. KOLBO: He would be -- it seems to me,\nperhaps, Your Honor, entitled for relief for damages.\nHe's -- he's not at this point seeking to be admitted to\nthe University. He's graduated with the passage of time,\nit's been five-plus years since this suit was filed,\nMr. Hamacher has attended and graduated elsewhere. It\nseems to me he would be entitled to damages.\nQUESTION: And the Court agreed with him as far\nas the program that was in place when he applied. The\nCourt, I thought, held that program unconstitutional.\nMR. KOLBO: It did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And -- but upheld the program that\ncame into being after his application, and he hasn't\nreapplied under the new -- but he -- but there was a class\ncertified, so I suppose you could substitute another\nplaintiff, someone who is applying under the current\nsystem.\nMR. KOLBO: Well -- well, our position, Your\nHonor, is that because the class was certified with\nrespect to Mr. Hamacher, that that's sufficient; that if\nthe -- if the system is found unconstitutional, he is an\nadequate class representative. Sure. Certainly.\nOne of the critical things that is demonstrated\nin this case is how easy it is for one system to be\ndisguised as another. What has happened in this case is\nthat for five years again, the University defended the\nsystem with its facially separate admission guidelines,\nwith its reserved seats, and then in -- two years into\nthis case, in fact, was still using some of these\nparticular forms in its admissions policy. It is an\nindication, I think, of how difficult it is to conclude\nthat what we have here is a system that, for example,\ncomports with what Justice Powell indicated he was -- he\napproved of in the -- in the Bakke case.\nWhat we have here is a system that was -- is not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve any governmental interest,\nany compelling governmental interest.\nI would like, if I may, to return to the issue\nof diversity and the diversity issue as a -- as a\ncompelling state interest. The fundamental problem with\nthe diversity rationale is that it depends upon the\nstandardless discretion of educators.\nIt is a discretion that would be exercised in a\nnumber of different respects.\nabout this. The University and its amicus have all made\nit clear that in their judgment they ought to be entitled\nto use race as much as necessary in their educational\ndiscretion.\nIf that is the rule that we end up accepting,\nthen universities are free in their discretion to choose\nwhich races are discriminated against, which are favored.\nWe can have one institution that discriminates against one\ngroup of individuals, and another against another. We can\nhave with the -- with shifting fashions and -- and\npreferences and time, the preferences for the races can\nshift. An example of that is found in comparing the facts\nof this case to the Bakke case, wherein Bakke, Asian\nAmericans were included in the preference, and under the\nUniversity of Michigan's systems, they are excluded.\nThe -- the exercise of discretion will extend to\nwho's identified in a particular race.\nIt will be for educators to decide whether\nsomeone of a mixed race is someone that is entitled to a\npreference.\nYou can have anomalous situation of the\nUniversity's guidelines for example where someone who is\nboth half-white and half-black --\nQUESTION: How -- how does the University of\nMichigan decide those things?\nself-reporting type of system on the application?\nMR. KOLBO: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,\nit's a matter essentially of self-identification. So if\nsomeone of mixed race who is white and black identifies\nhimself as white, then as far as the University is\nconcerned, they don't bring the diversity that they're\nlooking for. If that person identifies himself as black,\nthen merely from that identification, they have fallen\nwithin the diversity that the University seeks.\nQUESTION: And -- and the reason that these --\nQUESTION: One thing I don't quite understand\nwhat difference does it make to your client whether\nthey're three or four races or five or six races as long\nas she's not one of them?\nMR. KOLBO: Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,\nit -- the problem --\nQUESTION: She's equally being discriminated\nagainst as a Caucasian, no matter how many other races are\npreferred.\nMR. KOLBO: That's true, Your Honor. I -- I\nraised the point because it -- it indicates how\nstandardless this interest is. It is not defined with\nrespect to any constitutional principle like, for example,\nan interest based on remedying discrimination. It is\nentirely discretionary with the University.\nQUESTION: So is it entirely discretionary when\nyou read a set of exam books, you know, it's highly\nsubjective, which is a little better than its --\nOften I'd make a mistake as a professor, so --\nso the fact that there aren't written-down standards is --\nis -- I'm -- I'm not sure of the Constitutional relevance\nof that when what you're trying to do is something lawyers\ndon't normally do, which is to select among people\nindividually considered which one is better for this\nparticular slot. Businesspeople do that, lawyers don't\nexcept when they're hiring.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But -- but I don't -- if you said to\na businessperson, this doesn't have standards, such a\nthing, I think they might laugh and say my job and\nexperience is to select who's better for this slot, so --\nso I'm not sure of the constitutional relevance of what\nyou say, which seems to me to me to grow out of the nature\nof the problem.\nMR. KOLBO: Well, again, Justice Breyer, the\nconstitutional relevance derives from the fact that we're\ntalking about a constitutional right here, the use of\nrace, which is not the same thing as --\nQUESTION: Yes, yes, but I mean, as Justice\nStevens just said, the constitutional problem consists of\nthe injury to your client and that injury is the same\nirrespective of the precise nature of the standards on the\nother side. And -- and what I'm sort of struggling for\nhere is I see your point, if you say you cannot use race\nat all, period. No matter what. That's a -- that's a\nclear position, which I think is one of your positions.\nBut once you depart from that, now I'm -- I'm interested\nin the detail. At that point I'm not quite sure the\nrelevance of what you're saying.\nMR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor, what I'm\nsuggesting is the Court itself has made clear that for an\ninterest to be compelling, one of the considerations that\nthe Court must look at is whether there are standards --\nindependent, ascertainable standards apart from the\ndiscretion exercised by, say, an employer to determine\nwhether the interest is one that's compelling and one that\nthe Court can oversee. That interest, that standard --\nthat standard exists, for example, when we have an\ninterest in remedying identified discrimination. The\nCourt has made it clear that what with can be done in that\ncase is you can measure the extent to which there has been\npast discrimination, that's not a matter of discretion for\nthe employer to decide, and once you've measured the\nextent of that discrimination, you can tailor your remedy\nto that interest.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kolbo, because you mentioned the\nemployer and the employer's judgment, I gathered from your\nbrief that this case is not simply about public\nuniversities. Employment -- because you bring up 1981 and\nyou bring up Title VI -- under Title VI, this case is as\nmuch about Harvard as it is about Michigan, isn't that\ntrue?\nMR. KOLBO: The same standard would apply,\nJustice Ginsburg, that's correct.\nQUESTION: And it -- and in the private sector,\nemployment in the private sector, there's 1981. So there,\ntoo. So this case is much larger than private --\npublic -- public universities. It's all colleges and\nuniversities, and it's the entire realm of employment if\nyou're right.\nMR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor, I want to be clear\nabout what it is that we're arguing for here today. We\nare not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of\nrace under any circumstances. What we are arguing is that\nthe interest asserted here by the University, this\namorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is\nnot a compelling interest. Nothing we argue today and\nnothing we seek to do today would undo the Court's\nprecedents that have recognized if some --\nQUESTION: As far as --\nQUESTION: But I think you are arguing that\nanything except remedies for past discrimination is\nimpermissible.\nMR. KOLBO: Your Honor, that is not a conclusion\nthat we need to follow from this Court's decision.\nQUESTION: No, I -- I think that's your\nposition, is it not? That the only permissible use of\nrace is as a remedy for past discrimination?\nMR. KOLBO: I would not go that far, Justice\nStevens, there may be other reasons. I think they would\nhave to be extraordinary and rare, perhaps, rising to the\nlevel of life or limb. We do know that the Court has\nrecognized past identified discrimination.\nQUESTION: What about Weber, to take a specific\ncase? Employment setting, the employer says I don't want\nto confess to having been a past discriminator, but I'm\nwilling to engage in this voluntary affirmative action. I\ntake it that that would be impermissible if we adopt your\nview?\nMR. KOLBO: Weber, as I understand it, is a\nTitle VII case, Your Honor and it's not implicated by this\ndecision.\nQUESTION: But there's 1981, then -- then the\nperson who was attacking it on grounds that it's racially\ndiscriminatory just says my lawsuit is under 1981, which\nit could be as well as Title VII and then what is the\nresult?\nMR. KOLBO: Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,\nthat -- if the Court could resolve the issue consistent\nwith Title VII, which has remedial --\nQUESTION: If the suit is brought under 1981,\nthe Court can decide what the plaintiff's complaint should\nbe?\nMR. KOLBO: No, no, if this Court decides this\ncase under section 1981, the only interest asserted here\nat least is an interest in diversity that we are asking to\nstrike down. It may be that there are some other\ninterests, including a remedial one, that would be\njustified under some other statute. But the issue is not\npresented.\nQUESTION: But there was no -- this is a\nvoluntary affirmative action, no admission of prior\ndiscrimination. I gather if someone brought a 1981 suit,\nto stop that, your theory is that that person would\nprevail?\nMR. KOLBO: The use of race to exceed non-\nremedial objectives, I think would have problems, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Congress wanted race to be considered\nby private institutions such as Harvard and what-not, if\nthere's a problem with 1981, or any of the other Federal\nstatutes, they can simply amend it. What the -- the only\nthing that the Constitution applies to is State action.\nMR. KOLBO: Yes, that's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: And all the rest is simply Congress'\ndecision to impose a similar restriction upon private\nactors, which decision it can change if it wishes.\nMR. KOLBO: That's my understanding, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Or suppose you say you used the word\nextraordinary as compelling justification, and the other\nside says, yes, extraordinary, we're 280 million people,\nwe have large racial diversity within the country, the\nworld is even more diverse, and we think from the point of\nview of business, the Armed Forces, law, et cetera, that\nthis is an extraordinary need to have diversity among\nelites throughout the country. That without it, the\ncountry will be much worse off. That's what we're being\ntold.\nIn fact, the country might not function well at\nall. And we have to train those people. We have to. All\nright, now, how can you say, or can you say, that isn't\nextraordinary? That isn't a question of life or limb for\nthe country? It isn't really that necessary, when so many\npeople are telling us the contrary?\nMR. KOLBO:\nimportant constitutional rights at stake. And those\nrights are the right to equal protection. And a mere\nsocial benefit that is having more minorities in\nparticular occupations or the schools simply doesn't rise\nto the level of compelling interest.\nIt simply is not -- it doesn't remedy a\nconstitutional value, like --\nQUESTION: So if the University president or the\ndean told you just what Justice Breyer said, you would\ntell them there's -- and that we have underrepresentation\nof minorities, you would tell them there's nothing you can\ndo about it?\nMR. KOLBO: I would say, Your Honor, that racial\npreferences are not the answer. If there are problems\nagain in not getting a sufficient number of -- if\nminorities are not competing at the same level as other\nracial groups then we should take steps to solve that\nproblem. But racial preferences, because they injure the\nrights of innocent people, because it's a prohibition\ncontained in our Constitution, simply aren't permissible\nto remedy that problem. If I may reserve the remainder of\nmy time, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kolbo.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe University of Michigan admissions program\nhas created a separate path and a separate door for\npreferred minorities. For those groups, if they meet\nbasic qualifications, their path is always clear and their\ndoor is always open.\nNon-preferred racial groups face rigorous\ncompetition to get through the other door.\nThe University admits that race is such an\noverarching factor in its admissions process that\neventually every qualified underrepresented minority\napplicant will be admitted. The 20 point bonus, which is\none full grade point, nearly twice the benefit of a\nperfect SAT score, and six times better than an\noutstanding essay, the -- that bonus is actually\nunnecessary with the way the plan actually works, because\nevery qualified candidate who gets the bonus gets into the\nUniversity. It might just as well be an admissions\nticket.\nThe University acknowledges that its pre-1999\nadmissions program used separate grids, separate\nqualifications, separate standards and protected seats.\nThey acknowledge that this system was -- which was held\nunconstitutional and was not challenged, yet they\nstipulated that the only changes that they made from that\nsystem affected only the mechanics, not the substance of\nhow race and ethnicity were considered in the admissions\nprocess.\nQUESTION: First the changes were sufficient to\nconvince the district judge that it was on the other side\nof the constitutional line?\nGENERAL OLSON: Notwithstanding the fact that\nthe -- the University -- we -- we respectfully disagree\nwith that conclusion, because the -- the University itself\nadmitted that it only changed the mechanics. It intended\nto produce the same --\nQUESTION: Yes, but isn't -- isn't -- I mean,\nmechanics is another word for tailoring. And they're\nsaying we have tailored it differently. Our objectives\nare the same. We may be reaching those objectives in\nroughly the -- the same proportions, but the argument is\nan argument about tailoring and we've changed the\ntailoring.\nGENERAL OLSON: We submit Justice Souter, that\nthe changes which they referred to as mechanics were\ncosmetics, that ultimately, the system was intended to,\nand they acknowledge, to produce the same outcome as the\nprior system.\nQUESTION: Yes. The stipulation is that it did\nnot change the substance of how race and ethnicity were\nconsidered.\nGENERAL OLSON: Correct, Justice Kennedy. And\nwhat the Court only needs to look at the operation of the\nsystem. That 20 point bonus means that if you pass the\nminimum qualification standards at the University of\nMichigan, you were admitted.\nEveryone else just like in the Davis program,\nhad to compete -- people that were not in the preferred\nraces, who were not on the preferred class had to compete\nwith one another.\nQUESTION: It was the same 20 points given --\nsocioeconomic status also had 20 points?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: And atlethics, too, I think?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, and you couldn't get both.\nBut if you had -- whether -- whatever your background,\nwhether you were an athlete or not, you got the 20 points\nsolely because of your race. There were other systems,\nthat the Constitution doesn't implicate.\nQUESTION: I thought you got only one 20?\nGENERAL OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION:\nwouldn't get race?\nGENERAL OLSON: That's correct. But if you --\nirrespective of those other factors, if you didn't get the\n-- the 20 point bonus for being an athlete or -- for\nsocioeconomic conditions, the only thing that was required\nwas to be a member of the preferred race. Like the other\nprogram that we're hearing today, the same State, the\nstate Board of Regents, this plan violates every standard\nthat this Court has set for the examination of racial\npreferences.\nIt is a thinly disguised quota because there's\nonly one path, a segment -- Justice O'Connor put it this\nway in Croson -- a segment of the class reserved\nexclusively for certain minority groups. It isn't tied to\na particular number. It's a segment of the class reserved\non the basis of race.\nIt is -- it is based upon the stigmatizing\nnotion that if you are a certain race, you think a certain\nway or if you're a certain race, you have certain\nexperience that's are common.\nQUESTION: What do you say to the argument that\nnumber one, it's not stigmatizing, because the box study\ncertainly didn't show that it was, and number two, the\nobjective is not to show that there is a correlation\nbetween race and one point of view.\nshow students what the correlation or no correlation is\nbetween races and points of view. And it seems to me that\nthe Michigan plan is equally consistent with the latter\ninterpretation as with the former.\nGENERAL OLSON: What we're saying is that if you\nassume that because you are white or you are red or you\nare brown or you are black, you must have certain\nexperiences and you must have certain viewpoints.\nQUESTION: The argument is that you need to have\nenough of them to demonstrate that the point of view does\nnot always fit just one person.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, but Justice Stevens --\nQUESTION: And that was a finding I think?\nGENERAL OLSON: -- that's a self-contradictory\nrationale that they've come up with. They've said first\nof all you have these characteristics because you're black\nbut we must admit enough of you into the class to prove to\nthe other students that -- that black isn't the reason\nyou're --\nQUESTION: No that is not -- the argument is\nbasically that, look, people who have grown up in America\nand are black, regardless of race, no, not regardless of\nrace, regardless of socioeconomic background have\nprobably, though not certainly, shared the experience of\nbeing subject to certain stereotypical reactions from\npeople throughout their lives.\nNow, that may have led them to react one way, or\nanother way or not react at all.\nAnd indeed many of the students in our class\nwill have stereotypical reactions. And it's good for them\nas well as for everyone else to rid themselves of those\nreactions. And we want people in this school of all kinds\nwho are black, because that will be helpful education.\nNow, that's their argument, I think, in that\nrespect, not the argument that all black people are poor,\nnot the argument that all black people have been\ndiscriminated against, not the argument that all black\npeople share a point of view.\nAs I read it, that's their argument. And so\nyou're reply to that argument is what?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, their argument, A, takes\nseveral forms, at one point it's that, at one point, it's\nthe need to get more people elite -- of different\nbackgrounds, it's a -- but what this Court has said that\nracial preferences, racial stereotyping, which it is, is\nstigmatizing, it's divisive, it's damaging to the fabric\nof society, it's damaging to the goal ultimately to\neliminate the problems that racial discrimination and\nracial differences have created.\nQUESTION:\nworld, and this problem is a global problem. Other\ncountries operating under the same equality norm have\nconfronted it. Our neighbor to the north, Canada, has,\nthe European Union, South Africa, and they have all\napproved this kind of, they call it positive\ndiscrimination. Do we -- they have rejected what you\nrecited as the ills that follow from this. Should we shut\nthat from our view at all or should we consider what\njudges in other places have said on this subject?\nGENERAL OLSON: I submit, Justice Ginsburg that\nnone of those countries has our history, none of those\ncountries has the Fourteenth Amendment, none of those\nhistories has the history of the statements by this Court\nwhich has examined the question over and over again that\nthe ultimate damage that is done by racial preferences is\nsuch that if there ever is a situation in which such\nfactors must be used that they must be -- race neutral\nmeans must be used to accomplish those objective, narrow\ntailoring must be applied, and this -- this -- these\nprograms fail all of those tests.\nQUESTION: General Olson, do you know whether\nany of those countries that Justice Ginsburg referred to\nthat have gone down the road of racial preferences, racial\nentitlements, have ever gotten rid of racial preferences\nor racial entitlements?\nGENERAL OLSON: There --\nQUESTION: Has it been the road to ultimately a\ncolor blind society or has it been the road to a society\nthat has percentage entitlements for the various races?\nGENERAL OLSON: Sadly, I believe that that is\ncorrect, Justice Scalia, and let me conclude by saying\nthat the Michigan Law School and the University of\nMichigan ultimately must make a choice. It may maintain\nits elitist, as it refers to it, selection process without\nregard to race, or it may achieve the racial diversity it\nseeks with race neutral compromises in its admission\nstandards.\nBut the one thing that it may not do is\ncompromise its admission standards or change its admission\nrequirements for one race and not another.\nThat is forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Is it also forbidden for the United\nStates military academy?\nGENERAL OLSON: It may well be Justice Stevens.\nWe're not defending the specifics of those programs, but\nwe have not examined them individually. We -- we believe\nthat the ultimate solution to the problem that race has\ncreated -- that difference in race has created in this\ncountry has got to be according to what this Court has\nsaid, the most neutral race -- neutral means possible.\nQUESTION: Thank you General Olson.\nMr. Payton, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN PAYTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PAYTON: Mr. Chief Justice and, may it\nplease the Court:\nI think I want to spend just a few minutes\nbriefly setting the record straight on why it is the\neducational judgment of the University of Michigan that\nthe educational benefits that come from a racially and\nethnically diverse student body are crucial for all of our\nstudents and why those benefits do not depend in any way\non the assumption that, for example, all African Americans\nthink alike.\nLS&A, our premiere undergraduate institution, is\nan undergraduate college, most of its entering students\ncome in as 18-year-olds, about two-thirds come from\nMichigan, and about half from Detroit or the greater\nDetroit area. Michigan, I think as everyone knows is a\nvery segregated State.\nQUESTION: Half of the ones who come from\nMichigan come from Detroit?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes. Half of our students come\nfrom -- yes.\nMichigan is a very segregated State. Detroit is\noverwhelmingly black. Its suburbs and the rest of the\nstate are overwhelmingly white. While Michigan is extreme\nin this regard, it's not that extreme from the rest of the\ncountry. The University's entering students come from\nthese settings and have rarely had experiences across\nracial or ethnic lines. That's true for our white\nstudents. It's true for our minority students.\nThey've not lived together. They've not played\ntogether. They've certainly not gone to school together.\nThe result is often that these students come to\ncollege not knowing about individuals of different races\nand ethnicities. And often not even being aware of the\nfull extent of their lack of knowledge. This gap allows\nstereotypes to come into existence.\nAnn Arbor is a residential campus, just about\nevery single entering student lives on campus in a dorm.\nOn campus, these 18-year olds interact with students very\ndifferent from themselves in all sorts of ways, not just\nrace, not just ethnicity, but in all sorts of ways.\nStudents, I think as we know, learn a tremendous amount\nfrom each other.\nTheir education is much more than the classroom.\nIt's in the dorm, it's in the dining halls, it's in the\ncoffee houses.\nnighttime. It's all the time.\nHere's how critical mass works in these\ncircumstances. If there are too few African-American\nstudents, to take that same example, there's a risk that\nthose students will feel that they have to represent their\ngroup, their race. This comes from isolation and it's\nwell understood by educators. It results in these token\nstudents not feeling completely comfortable expressing\ntheir individuality.\nOn the other hand, if there are meaningful\nnumbers of African-American students, this sense of\nisolation dissipates.\nQUESTION: Mr. Payton, what is a meaningful\nnumber?\nMR. PAYTON: It's what we've been referring to\nas critical mass.\nQUESTION: Okay, what is critical mass?\nMR. PAYTON: Critical mass is when you have\nenough of those students so they feel comfortable acting\nas individuals.\nQUESTION: How do you know that?\nMR. PAYTON: I think you know it, because as\neducators, the educators see it in the students that come\nbefore them, they see it on the campus.\nQUESTION:\nUniversity of Michigan spend a lot of time with the\nstudents?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes, they do. This is a incredibly\nvibrant and complex campus that has diversity in every\nconceivable way. And I think --\nQUESTION: Do they spend a lot of time with them\nother than lecturing to them?\nMR. PAYTON: They do. In the record, we\nactually have an expert report that's not contradicted in\nany way by Professor Raudenbush and by Professor Gurin,\njust on the issue of how do you know when you have enough\nstudents in different contexts and circumstances so that\nthere will be these meaningful numbers.\nQUESTION: What do they say?\nMR. PAYTON: They said that given the numbers\nthat have been coming through in the last several years,\nwe are just getting to that critical mass. And the way\nthey analyzed it was to look at the circumstances in which\nstudents interact. A entering seminar, a dorm context, a\nstudent activities context, student newspaper context, to\nsee what would happen if you distribute the students\nacross these small encounter opportunities.\nQUESTION: Does Michigan have, as some schools I\nknow have, schools that have affirmative action program,\ndoes it have a minority dormitory?\nMR. PAYTON: No. The answer is no. We have\ndormitories like I said. Just about every single entering\nstudent stays in a dormitory. We do not have any\ndormitories where your entrance into it is governed by\nyour race. But we have tremendous representation in our\ndormitories because everybody has to stay there, okay?\nSo the answer is --\nQUESTION: I mean, apart from being excluded, if\n-- it is in fact the residential pattern quite mixed and\nthere are no dormitories that are, you know, just as\nsometimes there is -- there is the jocks dormitory, there\nis really no African American dormitory?\nMR. PAYTON: The answer is there is no African\nAmerican dormitory, put it -- the full answer is more\ncomplex. After students are there for their first year,\nthey can choose to move off campus. They can choose to\nstay on campus. Many stay on campus, many move off\ncampus. Ann Arbor is a college town and off campus is\nactually in the larger campus community and what they do\noff campus is obviously up to the students themselves, but\nI think that's -- you know, that's the real world. If you\nhave the meaningful numbers of minority students, what\nthen happens is that students will see a range of ideas, a\nrange of viewpoints from and among those students and they\nwill then see things that they may not have expected,\nsimilarities and differences, and those in turn will have\nthe result of undermining stereotypes, you know, and this\nhappens for the minority students, and the white students.\nThis happens for all the students. You know,\nthe benefits from this affect every single student that\ncomes through. And they're dependent on their being\nmeaningful numbers, or critical mass, of minority\nstudents, or the benefits don't come about.\nThat's the interest that the University is\nasserting. That's why they think that this is so crucial.\nEducation, understanding, produces citizens and leaders in\nour complex society.\nQUESTION: But where we are is, there's an\nassumption, you may not agree with it, but it's one\nbeginning assumption in this area, that there may not be a\nquota, every -- all of the eloquent things you said could\nbe easily met by a quota. That -- let's just assume for\nargument, we cannot do.\nI have to say that in -- in looking at your\nprogram, it looks to me like this is just a -- a disguised\nquota. You have a -- a minority student who works very,\nvery hard, very proud of his athletics, he gets the same\nnumber of points as a minority person who doesn't have any\nathletics -- that to me looks like an overt quota.\nMR. PAYTON:\nbelieve it's not a quota at all and I can believe -- I can\nsimply explain this. The way it works, an application\ncomes in, it is reviewed on the basis -- every single\napplication is read in its entirety by a counselor, every\nsingle application. It is in fact judged on the basis of\nthe selection index, which has the 20 points for race and\n20 points for athletics, but it also has all sorts of\nother things that it values, in state, underrepresented\nstate, underrepresented county within Michigan,\nsocioeconomic status, what your school is like, what the\ncurriculum that you took at your school is like.\nQUESTION: But none of that matters.\nMR. PAYTON: Your grades --\nQUESTION: None of that matters if you're\nminimally qualified and you're one of the minority races\nthat gets the 20 points, you're in, correct? The rest is\nreally irrelevant?\nMR. PAYTON: The way it works is that every\napplication comes through and it's read in its entirety,\nit is evaluated taking all of these factors into account,\nand then based upon the number that comes off the\nselection index which can go up to 150, the students are\nall competing against each other. There is a score that\nis evaluated throughout the year, because there's an\noverenrollment problem that always has to be managed and\nif the score is higher, you are in, and that doesn't\nmatter about anything other than what the score is. In\naddition, the counselor can on the basis of three factors\nsee that an application is reviewed by the admissions\nreview committee.\nQUESTION: Mr. Payton, in your brief, you say\nthe volume of applications and the presentation of\napplicant information may get impractical for LSA to use\nthe same admissions system as the much smaller University\nof Michigan Law School.\nNow, you're saying that every single application\nfor admission to LSA is read individually?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes. Sometimes twice. Because\nevery application is read when it comes in, and those that\na counselor flags that -- because they find that there's\nthree factors you have to have flag an application --\nacademically able to do the work, above a certain\nselection index score and also contributes at least one of\nvarious factors that we want to see in our student body,\nincluding underrepresented minority status, but also very\nhigh class rank and a whole range of other things.\nQUESTION: When you say underrepresented\nminorities, what comparison are you making to say that\nit's underrepresented?\nMR. PAYTON:\nthe Federal Government has used it, and the reason Asians\naren't included, just to pick up one of the --\nQUESTION: How does the Federal Government use\nit?\nMR. PAYTON: I think there are three minority\ngroups, you know. Let me just go back and answer what we\nwant.\nQUESTION: Well, I think perhaps I could get a\nmore direct answer. How do you decide whether, say,\nAfrican Americans or Hispanics are quote underrepresented,\nclose quote?\nMR. PAYTON: I think this is actually a very\nimportant point. They are underrepresented in our\napplicant pool.\nQUESTION: Compared to what?\nMR. PAYTON: Compared to -- we have very small\npools of African Americans, for example, that are\nqualified to the extent that we require students to be\nqualified to do the work at the University of Michigan and\nwhat that means is that if we didn't take race into\naccount, we would not be able to get the numbers of those\nstudents, the critical mass, necessary for the educational\nbenefits that we want.\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. PAYTON:\nQUESTION: When you say underrepresented, it\nsounds like something almost mathematical, that you're\nsaying, we only have a certain percentage of -- and we\nshould have this percentage, well, what is this\npercentage?\nMR. PAYTON: It's actually not a percentage at\nall and it really is driven by the educational benefits\nthat we want from our diverse student body.\nIf we had in our applicant pool sufficient\nnumbers of minority students, African Americans, for\nexample --\nQUESTION: What is a sufficient number?\nMR. PAYTON: So that when we made our selection\n--\nQUESTION: I asked you, what is a sufficient\nnumber?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: An answer -- would you answer it?\nMR. PAYTON: A sufficient number so that when we\nmade our selections, we were achieving the critical mass\nof students that we need for the benefits I described.\nThat is not a fixed precise number at all, as you've\nheard. It is -- that's simply not the nature of the\ncritical mass. But when you're trying to figure out\nwhether or not in your applicant pool, you have sufficient\nnumbers, so that the normal operation of our process would\nyield a critical mass, that's underrepresented. We are\nunderrepresented with respect to Hispanics, with respect\nto African Americans and with respect to Native Americans.\nQUESTION: Because your standards are so high,\nyou say that there are very few of those who can meet your\nstandards. So why don't you lower your standards,\nactually, I mean if this is indeed a significant\ncompelling State interest, why don't you lower your\nstandards?\nMR. PAYTON: We do have sufficient numbers in\nour applicant pool to achieve the critical mass that we're\nachieving. We're not taking -- you're right we're not --\nQUESTION: By taking race into account, you can\nyou can do it. But --\nMR. PAYTON: But we're not taking students that\naren't qualified, you are correct about that, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: But just lower your qualification\nstandards, if -- if this value of -- of having everybody\nin a mix with people of other races is so significant to\nyou, just lower your qualifications.\nMR. PAYTON: It is that significant to us. But\nI think that --\nQUESTION:\ncollege you are, you can be a lessor college if that value\nis important enough to you.\nMR. PAYTON: I think that decision which would\nsay that we have to choose, would be a Hobbesian choice\nhere. Our premiere institutions of higher education, I'd\nsay, are part of our crown jewels. We have great\neducational institutions in this country. The University\nof Michigan is one of them. I think we are the envy of\nthe world. If we had to say, gee, our educators tell us\nthat it is crucial that for the full education they want\nfor those students, all of those students we needed for a\nstudent body, that the decision is, oh, gee, we want to\nyou decide to either have a poor education for the\nessentially white students and/or you can say, change what\nyou are as an institution. I think we get to decide what\nour mission is. I think the Constitution gives us some\nleeway in deciding what our mission is and how we define\nourselves.\nQUESTION: And anything that contradicts that\nmission is automatically a compelling State interest?\nMR. PAYTON: No. I think what we're saying is\nwe can achieve both of those things, because, in fact,\nachieving the educational benefits that come from a\ndiverse student body can be achieved, given our mission,\nif we can go about selecting students in a way to achieve\nthe critical mass of minority students that we need. We\nwant both of those things. We think that --\nQUESTION: Go ahead. Are you finished?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: I wanted to go back to Justice\nKennedy's question. The point system here, does it meet\nthe opinion of Justice Powell in Bakke when that was\ncalled for individualized consideration?\nNow, the concern that it does not, is that you\nunder this system would seem to have the possibility that\ntwo students -- one is a minority, African American, one\nis not, majority, and they seem academically approximately\nthe same and now we give the black student 20 points and\nthe white student, let's say, is from the poorest family\naround and is also a great athlete, and he just can't\novercome that 20 points -- the best he can do is tie.\nAnd so that's the argument that this is not\nindividualized consideration. And I want to be sure I\nknow what your response is to that argument.\nMR. PAYTON: I have two responses. The first is\nto say that it is individualized if that white student\nactually was socioeconomically disadvantaged, that could\nbe taken into account.\nQUESTION: But remember he has that and gets 20\npoints for it?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And he also is a great athlete and\nI've constructed this example to make it difficult for\nyou, and -- but I mean you see he can only get 20 points,\nno matter how poor he is. And no matter how great an\nathlete he is as well, and the -- let's say the black\nstudent who has neither ties him?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: But on individualized consideration,\nthe black student might lose, if there were the\nindividualized consideration.\nMR. PAYTON: Well, he might --\nQUESTION: And that's -- and that's what you're\ngiving him. Now what is the answer I'm -- I'm trying to\nfind your answer?\nMR. PAYTON: The answer is we value both of\nthose aspects of diversity. We want both of those\nrepresented in our student body, all right, if they tie,\nthey will being judged exactly the same as far as how the\nselection index works.\nQUESTION: What you're saying is that race is\nindividualized consideration?\nMR. PAYTON: I'm saying that each student --\nQUESTION: Otherwise you're saying that only in\nthe hypothetical given that only the white student\nreceives individualized consideration?\nMR. PAYTON: No, no. They both --\nQUESTION: Some are more equal than others?\nMR. PAYTON: They both receive individualized\nconsideration. They're both reviewed in their totality.\nThey both may be sent to the admissions review committee\nwhere they get a second reading. In Bakke --\nQUESTION: If in those circumstances, because we\nhave the white student who is both a good athlete and also\nvery poor, and the other student, the minority is not,\ncould that be sent to the -- the individual -- could that\nbe sent to the review committee and the review committee\nwould say, well, we have a special circumstance here, and\neven though the points tie, nonetheless when we look at it\ncarefully, we see that the white student has these extra\npluses, despite the points, we let in the white student?\nMR. PAYTON: The admissions review committee --\nabout 70 percent of the applications that it reviews in\nany given year are white student applications that are\nsent to it. Okay. It can reach its judgment irrespective\nof whatever happened in the selection index score.\nQUESTION: So they can ignore the points?\nMR. PAYTON: They can -- actually once it goes\nto them they simply look at the application and make a\njudgment.\nQUESTION: So I want a clear answer to this.\nThat review committee can look at the applications\nindividually and ignore the points?\nMR. PAYTON: It does.\nQUESTION: Yes. The answer is yes?\nMR. PAYTON: The answer is yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. PAYTON: And it does. In Bakke, where\nJustice Powell says that he could look at one example of\nan admissions policy and he discusses briefly the Harvard\nplan and then he has a long quote from it, there is the\nfootnote 50 that Ms. Mahoney mentioned. In both footnote\n50 and footnote 51 there is a citation to this study by\nCarnegie and he introduces that by saying in the footnote\nthere are in this study examples of the actions by other\nleading institutions, trying to get diverse student\nbodies. That study indicates that there are plenty of\nother models where in fact some effort to come up with a\nsystem to handle these different factors was successful.\nQUESTION: Mr. Payton, it's easy to say they can\nignore the points. Easy to say. Do you know of any case\nwhere a minority applicant, one of the minorities favored\nin your program, who was minimally qualified, got the\n20-point favor and was rejected?\nMR. PAYTON:\nQUESTION: Well, it's important, I mean, to say\ntheoretically, it's fine, yes, theoretically, you can\nreject it. But as I understand what -- what the other\nside is saying, it is automatic, if you are minimally\nqualified, and you get those 20 points, you are in, that's\nwhat they claim?\nMR. PAYTON: Actually --\nQUESTION: Now, do you assert that that is\nfalse?\nMR. PAYTON: That is not correctly describing\nwhat happens. The way the policy works and the way it is\nimplemented is how I described the policy. In fact, the\nresults of the policy are that most of the qualified\nminority applications do end up getting admitted. That's\nnot the design. The design is here's how you do it,\nhere's how the decisions are made, either on the selection\nindex score, some are sent to the admissions review\ncommittee. Most of those that are sent to the admissions\nreview committee are in fact not minority applications,\nbut the design is not gee, admit all qualified minorities,\nthe design is to take these different factors into account\nin order to achieve the student body that we think is\ncrucial here.\nQUESTION: So there are some qualified\nminorities who get the 20 points and who are rejected?\nMR. PAYTON: I believe that is the case, all the\nrecord says in this is that virtually all of the minority\nstudents, as a result of the policy ended up being\nadmitted. I think there are certainly some, I can't give\nyou one, I can't give you one, but there are certainly\nsome where if you work it out, you can see that won't\nhappen.\nQUESTION: But the design is to admit a higher\npercentage of the qualified minority applicants that you\nget, given the numbers that there are today, because if\nyou don't do that you won't get your mix?\nMR. PAYTON: The design is to make sure we get\nto the critical mass of the meaningful numbers and given\nthe small pool size we have, the way it operates is as you\njust described, but that's the way it operates, the design\nis to make sure we get the critical mass of students that\nare, in fact, necessary for the educational benefits that\nwe are asserting here.\nQUESTION: Has anyone at Michigan ever defined\ncritical mass as being anything more specific than\nsomething beyond token numbers?\nMR. PAYTON: I think that the reason I\nreferenced the two expert reports by Professor Raudenbush\nand Professor Gurin is to try to see this -- those two\nreports try to put this in sort of an everyday example,\nyou know, students don't interact with the student body as\na whole, they interact in small settings and it's to see\nif you see what our minority student population is how\nthat would distribute into these small settings. And on\nthe basis of how that distribution works, Professor Gurin\nlooked at it to see whether or not that looked like that\nwould be generating the interactions that she would expect\nfor these educational benefits.\nQUESTION: But in the criteria used by the\nadmissions committee, did anyone put a percentage figure\nor a specific number --\nMR. PAYTON: No.\nQUESTION: -- beyond the concept you've got to\nget more than just token representation?\nMR. PAYTON: No. The answer is no. And --\nQUESTION: Mr. Payton, do you know the origin of\ncritical mass that is being spoken of here as though it\nwere something that were invented? I know it goes back at\nleast with respect to the enrollment of women in law\nschool, the schools talked about we want to get a critical\nmass, so women will feel welcome because when they were\none at a time curiosities they did have to do as you said\ndefend -- they were representatives of their sex and if\nthey failed, all women failed. Once they had a critical\nmass, it was no longer necessary, the woman was free to be\nwho she was.\nBut that term I certainly was familiar with that\nterm used in that setting. It's -- it comes from\nsociology, doesn't it?\nMR. PAYTON: It does, and I think you've\ndescribed it exactly as it has come about with respect to\ndiversity and critical mass. In the Harvard plan, in\nJustice Powell's discussion of the Harvard plan, he\nclearly acknowledges and -- because the plan acknowledges\nthat you must have meaningful numbers and it means more\nthan token numbers and there's clearly an acknowledgement\nthat if you have too few numbers you get the dynamics of\nisolation that you just discussed.\nQUESTION: In the law school context, there was\ntestimony, I think from one of the admissions officers\nthat said 5 percent is too few, 10 percent might suffice.\nAnd he's talking in respect to what is a\ncritical mass. Now, do people coalesce around numbers\nlike that or is that just out of -- what do I do with that\npiece of testimony?\nMR. PAYTON: I think that in all of this, you\nknow, there's a false precision here that everybody wants,\nwhich is tell me exactly what this is, and I don't think\nit exactly works like that. You know, we have a lot of\nexperience as, you know, an educational institution about\nwhat has happened on our campus and what has worked. The\nclass that we've had, the entering classes that we've had\nover the last 4 years or so, have ranged from 12 percent\nto 17 percent, okay? Twelve percent to 17 percent. I'm\nnot saying it's a percent and I'm not saying it's that\nfixed range, but 12 percent to 17 percent is sort of how\nit is ranged and that has generated the representation in\nthe small groups that is what is working to achieve some\nof these educational benefits that we're talking about.\nBut it's not quite that precise as far as how\nall of this works.\nQUESTION: Mr. Payton, let me ask Justice\nO'Connor's question, when does all of this come to an end?\nMR. PAYTON: I think that we all certainly\nexpect it to come to an end. I think we're all quite\nsurprised if we looked back at Bakke, in 1978, I think all\nof us would be quite surprised from that vantage point to\nrealize that today in Michigan students live in such\nsegregated circumstances growing up, it's really quite\nunbelievable. We could not have foreseen that. I think\npeople thought that we were coming together in a way and\nthat hasn't occurred. That's created some educational\nchallenges and opportunities.\nThe test score gap, I think is narrowing -- we\nput that in our brief.\nabout how this is going to progress. There is progress.\nI think the pool is increasing. But I can't give you how\nlong is it going to last. I think we're all quite\nconfident that it's only going to last for X number of\nfinite years, I just can't answer with any precision that\nquestion either.\nQUESTION: Suppose the Court were to say that\nthe 20-point system and the law school system looked just\ntoo much like a quota and that quotas are impermissible?\nAs of that point, is it our burden to tell you what other\nsystems to use or is it your burden to come up with some\nother system, say, more individualized assessment in order\nto attain some of the goals you wish to attain?\nMR. PAYTON: I guess I'm not sure what the more\nindividualized assessment would be here. I'm not saying\nthat obviously there are things that could be done\ndifferently. We've done things differently. The two\nschools do things quite differently. But I think we're\nboth trying to achieve the critical mass, that I think\nthere's no dispute at all from anyone that the critical\nmass is essential to get the educational benefits that\nwe're talking about.\nIf this goal is a compelling interest, then\ncritical mass is essential to its attainment, given the\nsmall pool size that we're talking about.\ncrafted in another way? Obviously, from the amicus\nbriefs, there are a lot of schools that do it in different\nways. We're doing it in a very individualized way that in\nfact does allow students to compete. Every student is\nevaluated on the same criteria. You know, head to head.\nWe do take race into account in the way that you've heard\ndescribed. But I'm not sure that lacks the individuality\nthat you would be striving for.\nThis is, you know, an enormously important case.\nWhen Justice Powell said in Bakke that it's not too much\nto say that the Nation's future depends upon leaders\ntrained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of\nstudents as diverse as this nation of many peoples, I\nthink that statement was absolutely correct then. I think\nit is, you know, it has never been truer than it is today.\nThis is of enormous importance and correct, not just to\nthe University of Michigan, but I'd say to all of higher\neducation and I think to our country as a whole to be able\nto do things that bring us together, that bring us\nunderstanding, that result in tolerance and, I'd say, make\nus the -- more -- closer to the day that we all look\nforward to when, in fact, we are beyond some of these\nproblems that we've been discussing rather intensely here\ntoday.\nQUESTION:\nadmissions standards overall at least provide some\nheadwind to the efforts that you're taking about?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes, I do. I think they do in all\nsorts of ways. They are certainly producing black\nstudents, white students, Hispanic students, Native\nAmerican students who go out into our communities and\nchange their communities.\nQUESTION: You may have misunderstood me. I\nmean the -- Ms. Mahoney said earlier that the problem of\nlaw school admissions, in response to Justice O'Connor,\nthat it was for the elite schools, it was more a problem\nat the elite schools, when she was talking about Boalt\nHall, for example, you meant -- you suggested or alluded\nto in your argument today that, you know, you don't want\nto choose between being an elite school and the whole\ndiversity issue.\nIt -- would it be easier to accomplish the\nlatter if the former were adjusted, that is the overall\nadmissions standard?\nMR. PAYTON: I think that --\nQUESTION: Now, I know you don't want to make\nthe choice, but will you at least acknowledge that there\nis a tension?\nMR. PAYTON: I think that, you know, some of our\nother schools, the non-selective schools, actually some\ncan end up with completely undiverse populations as well;\nthat the fact that a school does not have selectivity\ndoesn't mean that the community college, in fact, is\ndiverse.\nSo I don't think it necessarily follows at all\nthat if you lower your standards and distribute this all\nacross the country, we will get these educational\nbenefits, you know, throughout our educational system.\nQUESTION: Now -- about 10 terms ago, we had the\nUniversity of Mississippi higher ed. case in here --\nMR. PAYRON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and the argument was made that the\nhistorically -- the HBCs, the historically black colleges\nprovided a different benefit to minorities. Would the\nsame arguments with respect to diversity apply to those\ninstitutions?\nMR. PAYTON: Yes. You mean do they benefit if\nthey had a racially and ethnically diverse student body?\nI believe most every single one of them do have diverse\nstudent bodies.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Payton.\nMr. Kolbo, you have two minutes remaining -- you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KOLBO: With respect to the point system,\nCounsel has made it sound as if it's sort of a fortuity\nthat the University of Michigan has an admissions system\nthat ends up admitting -- admitting virtually all minority\nstudents. In fact, I want to talk a little bit about the\nrecord here. We put in the record the guidelines from the\noriginal system that was in place in 1995 and 1997. At\nthe joint appendix, at page 80, it's made very clear that\nthe guidelines were set in 1995, when Jennifer Gratz\napplied to admit all qualified minority students. It's\nalso undisputed in this record that the way the University\ngot to the 20 points was to statistically design it based\non the old model. So what they've done is they've taken\nthe old guidelines that were set to admit all qualified\nminority students, statistically figured out how many\npoints they needed to give -- to give to students under\nthe new system to replicate the old system, and that's how\nwe ended up with 20 points.\nSo it -- it strikes me as disingenuous to\nsuggest that it's simply an accident.\nThese policies have a purpose. They grant a\npreference for a purpose. And the new system does what\nthe old system did -- did, which is to create a two-track\nsystem. It's not enough if you're Jennifer Gratz or\nPatrick Hamacher to be merely qualified to get admitted to\nthe University. To be admissible is not simply enough\nbecause of their skin color. If however you're a member\nof one of the minority students and you meet those minimum\nqualifications, that's sufficient. If that's not a\ntwo-track system, I can't imagine what one -- what one\nwould actually look like.\nWith respect to test scores, a question was\nmade -- a question was asked about how long are these\nsystems going to last. There's actually evidence, and\nthis was not put in the -- in the record by the\nUniversity, with respect to test scores and disparities,\nbut there's -- there's also opposing opinion which has\nindicated that as long as we have these preferences, they\ncreate perverse incentives. We've cited the work of John\nMcWhorter, for example, in our reply brief indicating that\ntest scores to the extent that they're not narrowing, or\nto the extent that the gaps are increasing may, in fact,\nbe to the fact -- due to the fact of these -- of these\npreferences. With respect to the Hobbesian choice that\nMr. Payton has talked about, they have resolved a\ndifferent Hobbesian choice. The University has decided\nthat they are willing to lower their academic standards to\nget their critical mass.\nThey've resolved that -- that Hobbesian choice\nthat way.\nchoice, how to get those objectives and stay selective,\nthey've resolved that Hobbesian choice on the backs of the\nconstitutional rights of individuals like Jennifer Gratz\nand Patrick Hamacher. They are the ones that are paying\nfor the Hobbesian choice that the University has resolved\nwith -- by the use of a two-track admission system.\nWith respect to the concept of critical mass,\nall I have to say, if one can't ascertain from the way\nit's defined, meaningful means sufficient, sufficient\nmeans critical, critical means sufficient, that meets the\ndefinition, it seems to me, of an interest that's too\namorphous, too ill-defined, too indefinite, just like the\nrole model theory, just like a remedy for societal\ndiscrimination, too indefinite to support the use of a\ncompelling -- to suit -- to use -- to be a basis for\nracial preferences.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Kolbo.\n"
