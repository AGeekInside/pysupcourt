KENDALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents three issues, two arising\nfrom purposeful and recurring misconduct by the trial\nprosecutors, and a third from constitutionally deficient\ndefense counsel. Prior to trial, the prosecutors promised\nto disclose discoverable material to the defense. They\nknew that Robert Farr would testify as a key witness at\neach phase of trial, and they knew that he was an\ninformant and had been paid for his services.\nMr. Farr did in fact take the stand at both\nphases of this trial. He denied he was an informant. He\ndenied he received any consideration for his work. He\ndenied tipping off the authorities that Mr. Banks would be\ntaking a trip to Dallas. He denied setting up Mr. Banks\nfor arrest. The prosecutors knew that when Mr. Farr gave\nhis testimony it was not truthful. They did not rise to\ntheir feet and ask Mr. Farr to correct this testimony.\nQUESTION: And it - is it your contention that\nthis is a basis simply for setting aside the sentencing\nphase of the trial?\nMR. KENDALL: We have asked this Court to affirm\nthe district court, who - who did grant relief on death\nsentence. We're not asking for relief on guilt innocence\non - on the Mr. Farr claim.\nQUESTION: All right. I'm - I'm - I'm somewhat\npuzzled by that, but you have three different claims to\ndiscuss here and I don't want to take too long. It - it\nwould seem to me that, if it - if - if this is the\nevidence at trial, that - that there's no additional\nobligation or special obligation at sentencing where that\nbecomes really a secondary matter.\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, the reason why we take\nthat position is that his testimony at the punishment\nphase is absolutely critical for the state to get the\ndeath penalty in this case. The district court recognized\nthat. The Fifth Circuit in this case said that that\ntestimony was crucial. What he told the jury was that Mr.\nBanks had returned to Dallas to get a gun so that Mr.\nBanks could on the return trip commit armed robberies and\ntake care of and eliminate witnesses.\nThere was no other testimony that came close to\nmatching that at the punishment phase, and the state had\nthe burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.\nBanks would be a danger in the future. If they didn't\nsatisfy that -\nQUESTION: Well, but - but you - you have the\nburden, don't you, to show that the outcome would have\nbeen - would have been different had the - had the state\ncome clean at the beginning? And as I understand it, you\n- you assert that - that he would not - a jury would not\nhave judged him as harshly if the jury had known that he\nwas going to get the gun in order that Farr could commit\nrobberies with - with apparently his assistance, rather\nthan what Farr had told them, namely that he had gotten\nthe gun in order that he would commit future robberies,\nright? And you think that would have made the difference,\nwhether he's getting the gun to let somebody else kill or\ngetting the gun to kill himself?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, Mr. Banks denied at\ntrial that he had any intent to commit any crime\nwhatsoever with regard to this robbery. And Mr. Farr had\nmade it clear -\nQUESTION: Understand. But - but - but you're\nsaying he admitted that - that he got the gun so that Farr\ncould commit robberies, right?\nMR. KENDALL: We think there's a world of -\nQUESTION: And that would have - would have -\nwould have tapped a wellspring of mercy in the - in the\njury's breast? I - I don't really see how it would make\nthat much difference.\nMR. KENDALL: No, Your Honor. The point is - is\nthat the - the state could not ask the jury to impose the\ndeath sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that Mr. - there was a strong likelihood that Mr.\nBanks would commit acts of violence in the future. We\nthink there's a clear difference, and the trial\nprosecutors recognized this, between Mr. Banks going to\nget a gun so that Mr. Banks could rob and kill, as opposed\nto providing instrumentality.\nBut more importantly, Your Honor, Mr. Farr\nrecanted that testimony at the Federal hearing and that\nrecantation was found credible by the district court.\nQUESTION: Recanted what testimony?\nMR. KENDALL: No one had the intent to rob\nanybody. That was a ruse that Mr. Farr used -\nQUESTION: Banks admitted that himself.\nMR. KENDALL: No. Mr. Banks admitted on the\nstand that he had finally agreed to accompany Mr. Farr to\nDallas to get a gun. But Mr. Farr denied - Mr. Banks\ndenied that he had any intent whatsoever to commit any\ncrime, and he flatly denied that assertion. Mr. Farr -\nthis was a ruse that Mr. -\nQUESTION: What - what - what was - what was the\ngun going to be obtained for? Self-defense?\nMR. KENDALL: It was -\nQUESTION: These people were being -\nMR. KENDALL: - it was a ruse -\nQUESTION: - threatened by somebody?\nMR. KENDALL: Justice Scalia, it was a ruse that\nMr. Farr used that was not true -\nQUESTION: Oh, that - that explains -\nMR. KENDALL: - to -\nQUESTION: - why Farr got it. It doesn't explain\nwhy Banks got it.\nMR. KENDALL: But that was not the theory that\nthe case - that the prosecutors asked the jury to conclude\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Farr would - that Mr.\nBanks would be dangerous in the future. The district\ncourt granted relief on that and we think that clearly we\nhave shown materiality on that point.\nQUESTION: As to materiality -\nQUESTION: But he - I take it you do not agree\nthat you have to show that the result would have been\ndifferent?\nMR. KENDALL: We - we do not agree with that. In\nfact, we believe that this Court has not retired the\nAlcorta and Napue standard, and - and it shouldn't use\nthis case. The - the standard in Alcorta and Napue that\nsays if the Government puts up perjured testimony, that if\nthere's a possibility that that testimony affected the\njudgment or if the judgment is reversed. We do\nacknowledge that this Court in Brecht did provide a rule\ngenerally for habeas corpus that is different from that\nrule. But it said in footnote 9 of that decision that\nwhere there are cases where there was a pattern of\nmisconduct, that the Brecht rule might not apply. There\nis clearly a pattern of misconduct by the Government in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Well, you have to show cause and\nprejudice, and I thought that under Strickler, the - the\nnecessity of showing prejudice requires that you show that\nthere is a reasonable probability that the sentence would\nhave been different.\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we've not -\nQUESTION: You - you don't think you have an\nobligation to show reasonable probability -\nMR. KENDALL: We do. We do, and - and -\nQUESTION: - that the sentence would have been\ndifferent.\nMR. KENDALL: We do, Your Honor, and the district\ncourt -\nQUESTION: You - you acknowledge that you have to\ndo that or?\nMR. KENDALL: On - on cause, we do, Your Honor,\nand we - we - we've met that clearly. So it's our\nsubmission here that Mr. Farr's testimony was critical -\nQUESTION: Alcorta was a case on direct review?\nMR. KENDALL: It was a habeas case, Your Honor,\nbut the Court has not distinguished between -\nQUESTION: But decided long before a lot of our\nother habeas cases, which have somewhat limited the\nrelief?\nMR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor, but the\nCourt, since Brecht, in - in subsequent cases, in - in\nKyles and in Strickler, has continued to refer to the fact\nthat there's this category of misconduct that has always\nbeen treated differently, and we do not see why it\nshouldn't be applied here. However, we believe that,\ngiven the importance of Farr in this case to the state's\ncase that we meet the reasonable probability standard, or\nwhatever the - other standard the Court would impose on\nus.\nThe Fifth Circuit reversed the district court -\nQUESTION: May I ask you whether the record shows\nthat counsel for Banks and Banks thought Farr was an\ninformant back in 1980?\nMR. KENDALL: There was repeated effort by trial\ncounsel to answer that question. At a pre-trial hearing,\ncounsel specifically asked the chief investigator, who's\nyour informant? And the investigator said, I'm not going\nto tell you. When Mr. Farr was on the stand, both at the\nguilt phase and at the sentencing phase, counsel asked,\nare you working for the state, are you an informant?\nQUESTION: Well, so there was a suspicion of that\nback in `80?\nMR. KENDALL: And I think after trial, given the\n-\nQUESTION: But then 16 years went by.\nMR. KENDALL: Yes, Your Honor, because there\nwere -\nQUESTION: And - and this wasn't evidence that\nwas under lock and key. There were witnesses. They just\nweren't easily available.\nMR. KENDALL: Your - Your Honor, there was - it\nwas very difficult for us to obtain this proof. We - we\nhad every right to belief the - given the fact that the\nprosecutors had said, Mr. Farr has been truthful with you\nin every way, that whoever the informant was in this case,\nit was not Robert Farr.\nWe only began to think differently about this\nwhen we finally got access to another of the critical\nstate witnesses, Charles Cook, who told us in 1992 that\nsome of his testimony was not truthful.\nQUESTION: Suppose we find that the - or - or\nconclude that the defense counsel was not as diligent as\nit ought to have been on this point. Is that somehow\nexcused by the prosecution's failure to present the Brady\nmaterial?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we think that we acted\nreasonably and diligently in post-conviction. We were\nmisled by the state, and in fact, we used that state\nhabeas - we filed in - in - in 1992 the claim on\ninformation belief Farr was an informant in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, it's - there's perhaps a slight\ndifference in being misled and simply a - a case in which\nthe prosecution does not come forward with Brady material.\nThere - they may be some distinction in the two. What is\nthe standard that you would have us apply in this case to\nrule for you with reference - if - if we base that ruling\non the prosecution's failure? Is it just a standard\nBrady?\nMR. KENDALL: That would be under Strickler. Our\nview is that because of the misrepresentations in this\ncase, we were - we were allowed to rely on those\nmisrepresentations. We wanted to litigate Farr's\ninformant status in the state habeas proceedings, but we\ncouldn't get the evidence to prove that.\nQUESTION: What -\nQUESTION: But specifically the\nmisrepresentations were what?\nMR. KENDALL: Were that Farr had - had - had\ndenied that he was a paid informant. He was a paid\ninformant, and the prosecutors in their closing arguments\ntold the jury that he had been completely -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. KENDALL: - truthful in every way with you.\nQUESTION: Had they also not given, or - or\nbefore trial had they not also said, we'll give you\neverything in the file?\nMR. KENDALL: They said, you don't have to file a\ndiscovery motion, we will disclose to you material that is\ndiscoverable, and this clearly was discoverable material -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: - when they put him on the witness -\nQUESTION: But they didn't - the defendant didn't\nask to discover anything. The prosecutor said, you know,\neverything is available to you.\nMR. KENDALL: He -\nQUESTION: What did - what - what did he ask for?\nWhat did defendant ask for?\nMR. KENDALL: He filed a standard discovery\nmotion, but the - the Government long before that said,\nyou don't have to file a motion, we'll provide material\nthat's discoverable to you. And there's no argument - the\n- the state has tried to say that it, even by calling an\ninformant, it does not have to reveal -\nQUESTION: Did - did -\nMR. KENDALL: - that status.\nQUESTION: - did - did the defendant get anything\nafter the prosecutor said, you don't have to file any\nformal motion, we'll give you everything you're entitled\nto?\nMR. KENDALL: It - the prosecution revealed prior\nconvictions on its witnesses. It did not disclose Mr.\nFarr's informant status or arrangement. It did not\ndisclose with regard to Charles Cook.\nQUESTION: Were there documents -\nQUESTION: Okay, but -\nQUESTION: Were there documents or arrest reports\nto show Farr's informant status, or was this just a - a -\na circumstance where the prosecution should have said\norally that this is his status?\nMR. KENDALL: When we finally obtained what was\nrepresented to us to be the full prosecution file in this\ncase, there was not one notation in there with regard to\nMr. Farr, identifying him as an informant. They were\nobliged to -\nQUESTION: So then there - you're not complaining\nthat documents weren't turned over?\nMR. KENDALL: That's correct. They -\nQUESTION: You're complaining that the - that -\nthat a statement was not made by the prosecution?\nMR. KENDALL: That - that we believe the law\nrequired them, once they decided to put this informant on\nthe stand, to disclose that factor to the defense.\nQUESTION: Because it was Brady material?\nMR. KENDALL: Because it was Brady material.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, may I go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question? You - you - you gave us some\nexamples of - of material that was turned over to you\nunder this policy in - in which it was not necessary to\nfile a motion. Was that material turned over you in\nresponse - to you in response to a specific request from\nyou, or did they simply come up with this and say, this is\nthe material that you could get if you moved for it?\nMR. KENDALL: It was turned over after a general\ndiscovery motion was filed, but that discovery motion was\nnever taken up at a hearing. This was disclosed -\nQUESTION: All right. Did the general discovery\nmotion refer specifically to what they gave you, or was\nthe motion simply, give us everything we're entitled to?\nMR. KENDALL: It - I believe it said give us\nprior convictions. And -\nQUESTION: Well, then that was what they gave\nyou.\nMR. KENDALL: And that's all that they provided,\nthat's correct.\nQUESTION: I mean, the problem that I'm - I'm\nhaving with this is, I thought at - and - and I - I - I\ngot into this myself, I realize, but I thought they had\nsaid, in effect, we'll give you everything you're entitled\nto. Now we're getting down to greater detail, and I think\nthe problem is mine, but I want to follow it through.\nThey apparently said, you don't have to file a specific\nmotion. Justice Ginsburg raises the question, well, what\ndid you ask for even though you didn't have to file a\nspecific motion?\nYou say that you filed a general discovery\nrequest that specifically did ask for prior convictions.\nThey gave you prior convictions. My concern is that the\nunderstanding between counsel was, we'll give you what you\nask for, but we are not volunteering by our representation\nto give you anything you don't ask for. If this is\ncorrect, then the only reason you would be entitled to\nthis would be an affirmative Brady obligation, whether you\nask for it or not.\nIs it the Brady obligation or do you think they\nhad undertaken something more extensive than Brady\nrequired?\nMR. KENDALL: I think that they assured counsel\nthat whether it was - whether they had to disclose\nsomething under state law or under Brady, that there was\nno need for litigation. They would provide Brady\nmaterial -\nQUESTION: But did they assure counsel that\ncounsel would not have to ask for it?\nMR. KENDALL: The letter - the letter says, you\ndo not have to file a motion, we'll provide you with\nmaterial that the law requires us to disclose -\nQUESTION: That the law requires us to disclose?\nMR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Material. I - I would take that to\nmean documents that we have that you're entitled to, and\nwe don't know that there are any documents reflecting -\nreflecting Farr's informer status, do we?\nMR. KENDALL: But, Your Honor, it said in lieu of\na motion, and so I think it was fair for counsel to\ninclude that there needed to be no litigation about\ndiscovery -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. KENDALL: - that the Government understood\nwhat state law and Federal law required.\nQUESTION: But maybe there had to be a request,\nnot litigation, but say, tell me, was he an informant?\nMR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: Tell me. Did you ever ask that?\nMR. KENDALL: I think after these assurances, I\nthink counsel -\nQUESTION: Please answer that question.\nMR. KENDALL: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Did you ever ask the prosecution\nwhether Farr was an informant?\nMR. KENDALL: At trial, there's nothing in the\nrecord where the prosecution was specifically asked. It's\nstate habeas. We pled a - a claim on information belief\nthat he was a paid informant. That required the\ngovernment lawyer who was - who was one of the trial\nprosecutors to respond, we believed, truthfully. He did\nnot respond to that, and that -\nQUESTION: Now, when was this?\nMR. KENDALL: That was in state post-conviction\nproceedings, and the - and he has was required to respond\ntruthfully to that, and under state law that -\nQUESTION: He didn't respond falsely. He just\ndidn't respond.\nMR. KENDALL: But under state law that is a no,\nthat is a denial.\nQUESTION: But -\nMR. KENDALL: But he -\nQUESTION: A failure to respond is a no, rather\nthan - than a yes?\nMR. KENDALL: Any - any factual allegation of petition\nthat is not addressed specifically in the answer is\ntreated as -\nQUESTION: So as a -\nMR. KENDALL: - a denial.\nQUESTION: And - and in addition -\nQUESTION: It was more than that though, wasn't\nit? It - they - in - in fact, the state put it in a\ngeneral denial. It denied each and every allegation of\nthe complaint, including the allegation that Farr was an\ninformer.\nMR. KENDALL: Well, it's clear that when you read\ntheir answer that the state had denied our allegation that\nMr. Farr was a paid informant in this case.\nQUESTION: And they had in effect at trial in the\njury argument vouched for his truth, as I understand it.\nMR. KENDALL: On - on both at the guilt innocence\nphase and at the punishment phase.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nQUESTION: That - that's the most shocking thing.\nDo - do we know that - that counsel who allowed Farr to\nlie on the stand, and indeed went on to argue to the jury\nabout Farr's testimony, do we know that counsel knew that\nthat was a lie?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there aren't -\nQUESTION: I mean, you - well, you can argue it\nwas his responsibility, you know, but I'm not talking\nabout whether it was his responsibility.\nMR. KENDALL: Mr. Elliott gave an affidavit in\nstate post-conviction that said that he was aware of all\nthe facts pursuant to the investigation and the\npresentation of evidence in this case. I would think\nthat, given Farr's important status in this case, there's\nno doubt that he knew. At the Federal evidentiary\nhearing, he did not in any way try to say that he did not\nknow that Farr's - was - had this informant status until\nmuch later at the trial.\nQUESTION: In 19 -\nQUESTION: This is a bit of an aside, but do you\nknow whether any disciplinary proceedings were ever\nbrought against the prosecutors?\nMR. KENDALL: There have been absolutely no\ndisciplinary proceedings whatsoever.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you about -\nQUESTION: But there's a - a number - you have\nBanks and I take it - tell - you want to talk to us about\nCooksey in the - in - in the sentencing phase.\nMR. KENDALL: Let - let me - we - let me go to\nthe Cook claim if I could. There was another very\ntroubling due process claim raised in this case, and that\nwas at the key guilt phase witness. Mr. Cook had\ntestified pursuant to a deal and that the state had\nwithheld impeachment material on him. Three months before\nthe evidentiary in the hearing in this case, we received\nfor the first time a lengthy pre-trial statement that had\nall kinds of impeachment material in that and that showed\nbeyond any doubt that Mr. Cook had lied in his testimony\nbefore the jury that he had not in any way, shape, or form\nrehearsed his testimony with the state.\nFrom the time of that disclosure until the\nevidentiary hearing, it was clear that this transcript\nwould serve as evidence for us to prove up our claim that\nthe state had suppressed material, impeachment material,\non Mr. Cook. And Mr. Elliott, the trial prosecutor -\nQUESTION: What - what did Cook testify to that\nwas - that was essential to the - to the sentence?\nMR. KENDALL: This was the - the key guilt phase\nwitness, Your Honor. He was the - the entire narrative of\nthe crime in the -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but you're - you're - you're not\nasking for the guilt to be - to be overturned. You're\nasking for the sentence to be.\nMR. KENDALL: With regard to the - Mr. Farr,\nwe're asking only for sentence relief. With regard to\nCook, we're saying he was the crucial guilt phase witness.\nQUESTION: So you're asking for reversal of the\nconviction on the basis of Cook?\nMR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. What - now, what - what was\nessential to the conviction that - that he testified to?\nMR. KENDALL: He - he provided - he had to - the\n- the prosecutor in his opening statement told the jury,\nMr. Cook is our critical witness, you have to believe him\nfor us to win this case. He said that over and over\nagain. Cook presented the confession -\nQUESTION: Well, he testified that the defendant\nconfessed to him several times, didn't he?\nMR. KENDALL: He - he was the only person who\nprovided information that Mr. Banks had confessed. He was\nthe only person that tied Mr. Cook to - Mr. Banks to any\nother evidence in this case. The trial prosecutor\nportrayed him accurately. He was the critical witness for\nthe Government at the - at the guilt phase of trial.\nQUESTION: And - and what do you say the state\nwithheld with regard to Cook? That it had gone over his\ntestimony in - in advance?\nMR. KENDALL: Well, what he was asked, the first\nquestion on cross-examination was, who have you talked to\nabout your testimony? He said nobody. He said, you\nhaven't talked to any about this case? I haven't spoken\nto anybody. That was a bald-faced lie.\nQUESTION: Well, it's on its face incredible\nanyway. You think the jury believed it?\nMR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, the -\nQUESTION: They think the prosecutors can just\nput him on without even asking him what he was going to\ntestify about?\nMR. KENDALL: Well, they certainly would - they\ncertainly would have believed that if the Government would\nhave disclosed this transcript that showed that three days\nbefore trial Mr. Cook had a very difficult time keeping\nhis narrative about this crime straight.\nQUESTION: How - how does that work? When this\noccurs and - and this - these questions are set forth in\nfootnote 4 of your brief - when this occurs, does a Brady\nobligation arise at that point?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, I think that -\nQUESTION: I'm the - I'm the prosecutor, I'm\nsitting there, I hear this guy say that he's never talked\nto me and I know that he has and I know that I have 71 or\n74 pages of notes. Do I now have a Brady obligation?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, for decades the Court\nhas said that when a government witness lies, the\ngovernment attorney has the obligation to correct that.\nThe Brady obligation continues, it's pre-trial and it's\nduring trial. It can arise during trial depending on - on\nwhat the government witness says, and it's clear that\nafter Cook gave that answer, that the Government was\nobligated, one, to have him correct his testimony, but\ncertainly not, after he'd given that testimony, to get up\nin front of the jury and say, Mr. Cook was completely\ntruthful.\nQUESTION: But my question is, is there a Brady\nobligation?\nMR. KENDALL: There is a Brady obligation,\nabsolutely.\nQUESTION: Well, now, is your point - your point\nis more than just that he said it, he didn't admit that he\nhad talked to other people before trial, is it?\nMR. KENDALL: No, no, no, because it - it was\nclear that what the defense was trying to show was that\nMr. Cook should not be believed because he's really been\nworked over by the prosecutors to get his story together.\nAnd that's exactly what the transcript that wasn't\ndisclosed demonstrated. He was mocked during this pre-\ntrial statement by the prosecutors who were preparing him\nbecause he was making so many mistakes and getting things\nall out of order.\nThey didn't believe he was a credible witness\nthree or four days before trial, and the only reason that\nhe was, or might have appeared credible, was because of\nthis session. This was classic impeachment material. The\nGovernment had this in their briefcase at trial. They -\nthey disclosed the - the brief statement that Mr. Cook had\ngiven four minutes before but not this one.\nQUESTION: But you lost on this point in the - in\nthe Federal court?\nMR. KENDALL: Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg, we\ndid not lose on it. The district court did not adjudicate\nthat claim.\nQUESTION: But your time - your - your light's\nflashing, and I - when you come back, I'd appreciate your\nasking - answering one factual question I have on this.\nIn 1996, you're in Federal court with five witnesses about\nFarr being a - an informant. In 1992, you say you learned\nfrom Cook information that led you to think you'd find\nthose witnesses. In 1992 and `93, you are in state\nhabeas. Why did you not either engage in that kind of\ndiscovery in state habeas or find those witnesses for the\nstate habeas court?\nMR. KENDALL: Because we - efforts were made, we\ncould not find Farr. But we - efforts were made, and we\ncould not find Farr, but we went right to the horse's\nmouth. James Elliott, the prosecutor in this case, knew\nthat he was a paid informant. When we raised that claim\nin our petition, he had an obligation then to - to tell us\nhonestly was he an informant or was he not, and he did not\ndo so.\nWe wanted to litigate his status, Farr's status\nin the state court. We were prevented from doing so\nbecause of the lack of candor and the lack of discovery\nfrom the prosecutor. He could have made this very simple\nand said, yes he's the guy, let's litigate this in state\ncourt. He didn't do so.\nLet me turn briefly to the ineffective\nassistance claim. The district court granted relief on\nthat claim after hearing information that this Court has\nsaid time and again is relevant to the capital sentencing\nprocess. The Fifth Circuit overturned that grant of\nrelief by making a - two legal mistakes. First, unlike\nthe district court, and - and not following the decisions\nfrom this Court, the - the Court vulcanized its review of\nour mitigating evidence instead of looking at it in its\nentirety and weighing that against the aggravation.\nIt broke this evidence up into three categories\nand said, looking at each one, weighing these on the\nscale, the panel found no reasonable likelihood of a\ndifferent result. That is clear -\nQUESTION: What - what categories were -\nMR. KENDALL: There was mental health evidence.\nThere was testimony about Mr. Vetrano Jefferson recanting\nhis testimony that - about who was the - who had been the\naggressor in a fight before this crime, and then the\ntestimony offered by the parents in this case.\nQUESTION: All going to guilt or some going to\nsentencing?\nMR. KENDALL: All - all going to sentence, Your\nHonor. This was -\nQUESTION: All going to sentencing?\nMR. KENDALL: This was only about sentence, Your\nHonor, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Of course, the parents had testified\nin the - and I think he even said that they were good\nparents, didn't he?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: And - and - and the fact that they\nwere these horrible parents were - was going to be\ntestified to by a Dr. Pina, is that it?\nMR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there was no claim that\nthese were horrible parents. They were loving parents,\nbut they was a very troubled family that Mr. Banks -\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. KENDALL: - grew up in, and it's - there was\nevidence that came out that was plainly relevant to the\nsentencing decision in this case.\nQUESTION: It came out of whose mouth?\nMR. KENDALL: It came out of Mrs. Banks' mouth as\na -\nQUESTION: Who -\nMR. KENDALL: Mrs. Banks, the mother -\nQUESTION: What did - what did she say?\nMR. KENDALL: - in the state habeas proceedings.\nQUESTION: What did she say?\nMR. KENDALL: She said that, for example, her son\nhad been subjected to all kinds of problems because of his\nvery serious dermalogical ailment that he had from birth\nall through his life.\nQUESTION: He had a skin - a skin problem -\nMR. KENDALL: A very serious -\nQUESTION: - and you think that would have\naltered the jury's -\nMR. KENDALL: Well, that was one piece of the -\nof the court -\nQUESTION: All right. What - what - I - let -\nwhat - what is all of it?\nMR. KENDALL: That her - her husband\nunfortunately had been an - a alcoholic and - and for\nyears when he became drunk would terrorize her, terrorize\nthe children. She often had to take the children and\nleave the house to assure her safety and Mr. Bank's safety\nand his siblings' safety.\nQUESTION: She testified to that?\nMR. KENDALL: She - she proffered that in state\ncourt, that's correct, Your Honor. And then the experts,\nMr. Cunningham in Federal Court, testified about what all\nthis does to an individual in the formative years of life.\nThis is -\nQUESTION: There was one specific incident of the\nfather tying the boy to a tree and whipping him. Were\nthere any other specific incidents or just general\nallegations that when he - he - when the father became\ndrunk -\nMR. KENDALL: It - it -\nQUESTION: - he became violent.\nMR. KENDALL: It was - it was Mrs. Banks'\ntestimony that there had been repeated instances where, to\navoid harm, they had to leave the home. In - there were\nsome problems that -\nQUESTION: Did she testify about being tied to a\ntree?\nMR. KENDALL: Did -\nQUESTION: Did - did Mrs. Banks provide the\ntestimony about his being a tied to a tree and whipped?\nMR. KENDALL: No, she did not.\nQUESTION: Who provided that?\nMR. KENDALL: Mr. Banks provided that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Banks provided that.\nMR. KENDALL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Not terribly credible if -\nMR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, the state has\nnever - in state court they did not attempt to show that\nany of this proffer was inaccurate or not true. Their\nposition in state court was simply that the trial lawyer\nhad done a good job, and so we'd failed to show prong one\nof Strickland. In the Federal court -\nQUESTION: Well, I'm - I'm just concerned whether\nit would make any difference. One - once again, your\nburden is to show that would have made a difference.\nMR. KENDALL: And the - and -\nQUESTION: Skin problems and an alcoholic father,\nyou know, who - who on the basis of Banks' mother's\ntestimony terrorized the child and Banks' testimony that\nhe was tied to a tree and whipped.\nMR. KENDALL: Your -\nQUESTION: I - I just -\nMR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, the - the\ntestimony here was that these were very serious -\nQUESTION: And this was -\nMR. KENDALL: - things that plagued Mr. Banks'\nlife -\nQUESTION: - and the jury would have thought that\nthis explains his - his - his cold-blooded murder of - of\nthe victim for his car?\nMR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, it might not\nfully explain it, but it would say that he's not the type\nof offender for whom the death penalty needs to be carried\nout against.\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kendall.\nMs. Bunn, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BUNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFrom 1983 to 1996, Banks filed three separate\nstate habeas applications raising numerous claims, but\nBanks failed to diligently pursue his current Brady and\nStrickland claims during these state proceedings. He\nelected instead to expend his efforts pursuing other\nclaims. It wasn't until Federal habeas proceedings that\nhe turned his efforts to developing the instant claims.\nQUESTION: Did - did the state deny in one of\nthese habeas applications, deny that Farr was an\ninformant?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, the state never denied\nit. It did fill -\nQUESTION: Well, now wait a minute -\nQUESTION: Then explain to me what was -\nQUESTION: - in - in - in the state habeas\nproceeding, the state submitted a response to the\npetitioner's petition and denied all the allegations in\nthe petition, which included the assertion that Farr was a\npaid informant and that the state had withheld that\ninformation from Banks. The state denied that, did it\nnot?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. It is not our\ninterpretation of the record that it did, because this\nsingle sentence found in a 145-page petition was buried in\na - basically a laundry list of claims of prosecutorial\nmisconduct, at the end of that section containing a great\nnumber of other allegations, which the state responded to\nspecifically by saying, first a number of them had been\naddressed in other sections of the brief, including the\nSwain claim, and another Brady claim that was fully\ndeveloped. And then it responded to the remaining claims\nby saying that they were all procedural - procedurally\ndefaulted based on the lack of a contemporaneous\nobjection.\nQUESTION: Ms. Bunn, did not the state say, we\ndeny each and every factual allegation in this complaint?\nMS. BUNN: Yes. There was a general denial at\nthe beginning of the - the state's answer to the 145-page\nbrief. However, the context -\nQUESTION: You better be careful what you deny,\ndon't you think? I mean, each and every would include\nthat, even if it's buried in, you know, if it's buried in\na lot of other stuff. I mean, you could have said, you\nknow, everything's so buried we can't tell what's what,\nbut you didn't say that. You said, we deny each and\nevery.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and it does appear\nthat -\nQUESTION: Is it that the case that - do you now\nconcede that Farr was paid something for his information -\nMS. BUNN: Yes.\nQUESTION: - by the state.\nMS. BUNN: Yes. Well, not for information. He\nwas paid to assist police in obtaining the murder weapon.\nQUESTION: Yeah. And did the state prosecutor\never disclose that during the trial, even though he said,\nno, everything's perfectly truthful here?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. The state never -\nQUESTION: He knew - he knew that Farr was\ntestifying falsely and he - he let that testimony go, and\nindeed relied on it in his summation to the jury?\nMS. BUNN: What the trial prosecutor knew -\nthere's nothing in the record to indicate the trial\nprosecutors actually knew about the money that Bank - that\n- that Farr was paid several months before the trial in\nthis case by - by police investigators.\nQUESTION: But isn't he charged with knowledge of\nwhat the organization as a whole did?\nMS. BUNN: In the - in the Brady disclosure\ncontext, certainly he is.\nQUESTION: Wasn't it representative of the police\nthere at the trial the whole time to assist the\nprosecutor?\nMS. BUNN: Not that - not that I'm aware of that\nthe police were at the - at - really have testified in the\ntrial. But I believe the rule was invoked in the trial,\nso he did not sit in on - on Farr's testimony or any of\nthe other state's witnesses' testimony. But -\nQUESTION: Well, I assume we have to take this\ncase on the - the premise that the state somehow knew that\nthe state had paid the money to Farr, and I guess also had\npromised some kind of a break not making certain criminal\ncharges?\nMS. BUNN: There is no evidence of any inducement\nof that kind to Farr in this case, no evidence of any kind\nof inducement whether financial or a break in - in any\nconvictions for his testimony, contingent upon his\ntestimony in this case. That's what distinguishes it from\ncases like Bagley and Giglio.\nQUESTION: But are you saying that because he was\npaid to help get the gun back rather than to testify\nfalsely?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. That is correct.\nQUESTION: So that he was paid for a critical\nrole in the scenario that led to the indictment, rather\nthan post-indictment false testimony.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. That is correct.\nBut again, as far as the cause issue goes, and there is no\ndispute that the claim is procedurally defaulted to - due\nto Banks' failure to develop it in - in the state court.\nThe dispute is whether he has established cause, and the -\nthe basis - the focus of the inquiry in cause is the\npetitioner's conduct, and in this case, the state record\nmakes clear that Banks was aware of this claim and\nactually alleged the claim in the petition itself.\nQUESTION: Well, does the petitioner's awareness\nthat there is a - a claim supersede the prosecution's\nobligation to disclose Brady material, and to disclose the\nfact that one of its own witnesses lied on the stand?\nMS. BUNN: Not that it supersedes the obligation\nunder Brady, but it does preclude a finding of cause in a\ncase like this where the nondisclosure -\nQUESTION: So the prosecution can lie and conceal\nand the prisoner still has the burden to - to discover the\nevidence? That's your position?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, because in a case\nlike this, unlike Strickler, unlike Amadeo, this is more\nlike - more like McCleskey, where the nondisclosure,\nwhether in trial court or in state habeas, did not prevent\nthe petitioner from developing the claim.\nQUESTION: But it didn't prevent it absolutely,\nbut it made it pretty tough, didn't it? I mean, the -\nsitting there in January, the prosecution has been not -\nbeen denying nonstop that Farr has been paid anything,\nthey're beginning to get some information maybe that isn't\ntrue. The prosecution is still denying it by denying the\nallegation, and they think they're going to have to find\nsomebody who will prove - who will say that, and they\ncan't find Farr.\nSo what are - what were they supposed to be\ndoing? They were looking for witnesses. They couldn't\nfind Farr. The prosecution isn't telling them the truth\napparently. And so, what - what is it that they should\nhave done?\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, this case does not\npresent a situation where there is a record developed on\nwhat efforts Banks expended on this case. There's nothing\nin the record to indicate that Banks' counsel pursued this\nclaim, that they sent investigators out to try to find\nFarr. There's absolutely nothing -\nQUESTION: I didn't say that. What I said was, I\nwas repeating what he said, that - and when they filed it\nin January - I don't want to repeat it again, you heard\nwhat he said too - and he said they're just learning from\nCook some time in 1992 that it might be possible to get\nevidence that would show what the prosecution was saying\nwas false.\nSo I want your opinion. You say it's quite\nclear that they should have investigated this further.\nReally? Because?\nMS. BUNN: Because they were obviously aware of\nthe claim, aware of the potential existence of the claim.\nThey requested no investigative assistance regarding the\nclaim. They investigated no discovery regarding the\nclaim. They - while they - what they did do was expend\nwhat at that point were pretty extensive resources\npursuing and developing their Swain claim and another\nBrady claim.\nQUESTION: But you want us to say that the - that\nthe defendant relies on his peril, at his peril, on the\nrepresentations of the - of prosecution?\nMS. BUNN: At - in - in a case like this where,\nunlike Strickler, where the evidence, the - the\nnondisclosed evidence was not in the sole possession of\nthe state. It was discoverable as - as actually\nultimately have it in habeas, in - in Federal habeas\nproceedings. Banks was able to procure this evidence.\nQUESTION: No, but you are - are - aren't you\narguing, just as Justice Kennedy suggested, that what they\nshould have done in this case is to go to the court and\nsay, we want further resources to investigate, and what\nspecifically we want to investigate is an issue which, if\nwe are correct, the state is affirmatively lying about.\nWe want investigative resources to prove that state's\ncounsel is lying. Isn't that your position?\nMS. BUNN: Well, yes, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: And for failure to do that -\nMS. BUNN: - that would be -\nQUESTION: - for failure to do that, they're out.\nIsn't that your position?\nMS. BUNN: That is part of our position, that\nessentially the absence of that, the absence of a request\nfor investigative assistance, the absence of any -\nQUESTION: But, in the - in the - in the face of\nthe state's representation. In other words, if - if they\nasked for it, I assume the state would have said, well,\nwe've told them that there isn't anything to this. And -\nand - and you would - you're saying that they should have\npursued it in the face of that for the purpose, among\nother things, of proving that state's counsel was lying to\nthem?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, they - there was an\nobligation from them to pursue the claim further, yes.\nQUESTION: Why wasn't there an obligation on the\npart of the prosecutor, having deceived the jury and the\ncourt, to come clean? Why is the burden on the defendant,\nwho was subjected to false testimony? Why is - and the\nprosecutor knows it - why isn't it the prosecutor's burden\nto come clean at any stage, rather than let this falsehood\nremain in this record?\nI just don't understand why it becomes the\ndefendant's burden when the prosecutor is best situated to\nhave the information, was this true or not, did we pay\nthis informant or not. Why isn't that a continuing\nobligation on any lawyer who makes a representation that's\nfalse to a court?\nMS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first - first it is\nnot - that's not the question. It is the habeas\npetitioner's burden to allege and prove - provide\nevidentiary support for his claim.\nQUESTION: Well, but it is the question if - if\nJustice Ginsburg is right, that prosecutors have a\ncontinuing obligation.\nMS. BUNN: Well, that obligation is essentially\ntriggered by materiality, so you have that working as\nwell. But that does not - the - the state's continuing\nobligation does not basically preclude a finding of - of -\nof no cause in a case like this.\nQUESTION: Well, if I were a defense counsel, I\ncould think of a - of a - no more damaging material of\ncross-examination in this case than to show Farr was paid\nmoney to come up with the story.\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, that - that\nwas not the - those are not the facts of this case.\nThere's no evidence and - and Farr has not said in post-\nconviction that he was paid for testimony.\nQUESTION: Yeah, that's true, but I - I mean,\nwhat -\nQUESTION: But I think it's even -\nQUESTION: - what bothers me about your position\nis, if we were to say that a defense counsel behaves\nunreasonably when he relies upon an explicit statement of\nthe prosecutor's, such as I deny the allegation, that's to\nsay that the justice system lacks integrity, and indeed it\nmight contribute to that lack of integrity to impose this\nkind of obligation and thereby excuse a prosecutor under\ncircumstances like this.\nMS. BUNN: But to find cause in a case like this\nwould essentially be to hold that a Brady claim can never\nbe defaulted because -\nQUESTION: Of course it can. All that it\nrequires is that a prosecutor who says, my files are open,\nwho says that we do not, in fact, deny that we paid money\nfor a related purpose to the witness, all it requires is\nthat he be telling the truth.\nMS. BUNN: And I want to focus also on the - on\nthe record itself and what Banks - Farr was never asked\nspecifically whether he was a police informant, so he\nnever denied that allegation. At the guilt innocence\nphase, starting - it - it's in the joint appendix at page\n37 - in the middle of questioning by defense counsel at\nthe guilt innocence phase about his drug - prior drug use\nand his drug habit, he - Farr was asked the question, and\nhave you ever taken any money from some police officers?\nAnd he answered no.\nThis was a false statement, but not to be\nconstrued as necessarily as a denial that he was a police\ninformant, particularly given the context of the\nquestioning. Later in the guilt innocence, he was asked -\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt with one\nquestion? But isn't it even more significant that his\nreal role in the - in the whole story is that he was the\nperson used by the police as an excuse to go up and get\nthe gun back two weeks after Banks had left it there,\nwhereas the record left the impression that Banks himself\nwanted that gun to commit future robberies, without any\nexplanation of the fact that the - that two weeks went by\nwithout any such request?\nAnd then when Farr gets in the picture, they go\nup to get the gun, and then Farr says, because Banks\ninsisted on it, which is not only false, but improbable\nand terribly prejudicial at the - at the sentencing\nhearing.\nMS. BUNN: Again, though, the - the materiality\nof Farr's - of this nondisclosure has to be - there are\nseveral factors that have to be assessed in that - in that\nissue. First, the fact that Farr wasn't paid for his\ntestimony, and the impeachment value of the informant\nstatus itself is limited to the mere fact that Farr had\nacted as a police informant in this case and had assisted\npolice in obtaining the murder weapon. But that\nimpeachment did not extend to any inference that Farr had\ntestified favorably for the state because he had any\nfinancial or any other kind of incentive to do so.\nQUESTION: What - what -\nQUESTION: But it - it was diametrically opposed\nto the notion that he wanted to get the gun to commit\nrobbery, as whereas the real purpose of the whole venture\nis to get the gun to give to the police.\nMS. BUNN: But Farr's subjective intent did not\nundermine Banks' intent, and Banks actually admitted at\nthe punishment phase -\nQUESTION: Banks' intent as revealed in Farr's\ntestimony, which is the only evidence in supporting that\ntheory that Banks was dangerous for that reason.\nMS. BUNN: The difference is, Farr's testimony\nwas - indicated that Banks was - had the intent himself to\nparticipate in the robberies, and Banks limited that to\nbeing willing essentially to - to abet Farr in - in\ncommitting those robberies.\nQUESTION: What - what page of the transcript\nthat you - you cited page 37. Is that in the joint\nappendix?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, joint appendix. That's the -\nQUESTION: And that is the - that is the\nconfession of - I'm sorry - that - that is the perjury -\nthat's the only perjury that's supposedly -\nMS. BUNN: That's the - that's one instance that\nthey - that - that's the only one dealing with money.\nWhat police officers -\nQUESTION: Of course, this doesn't - this doesn't\ndeal with whether he has - was a police informer. It - it\ndeals with whether the police officers promised you\nanything.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, yes, that's correct. And that -\nthe denial of that, of course, is - is not fault, because\nthere's nothing in subsequent testimony to indicate that's\n- that's untrue.\nQUESTION: Have you ever taken any money from\nsome police officers? No.\nMS. BUNN: Yes. That is a false statement.\nHowever, it can - it's - it is far afield to interpret\nthat as a denial of being a police informant.\nQUESTION: Where - where - where is that? Have\nyou ever taken any money from police officers?\nMS. BUNN: That is at joint appendix 37.\nQUESTION: It's three lines down from the top.\nMS. BUNN: In the middle of the questioning about\n- about Farr's prior drug use, defense counsel asks, and -\nand have you ever taken any money from some police\nofficers? There is further -\nQUESTION: Thirty, thirty-seven, my God, reading\n- oh, I got it, I got it, okay.\nMS. BUNN: Further, he's asked, what police\nofficers did you talk to about this? I have talked to no\none about this outside of when they called us down\nreferring to the case -\nQUESTION: Yeah. We got it.\nMS. BUNN: - which again is a false test - is a\nfalse statement, but does not specifically deny police\ninformant status.\nQUESTION: Now, it does seem to me that the\nCooksey report that the - I think it - the Cook - the -\nMS. BUNN: Cook.\nQUESTION: - the witness Cook -\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Charles Cook.\nQUESTION: - that the - that the report of his\ninterviews with - with the police was - was very, very\nstrong and helpful impeachment material. Do you want to\ncomment on - on the claim that relates to his testimony?\nMS. BUNN: Certainly, Your Honor. The lower\ncourts did not consider that claim to be properly before\nthe court because Banks failed to present it in his\nFederal petition, failed to present it in any amended and\nsupplemental position, and the - and there's nothing in\nthis - in this record to indicate - that would support a\nfinding of implied consent, or the trial by consent.\nQUESTION: Well, you said, I mean, the - the\nFifth Circuit didn't think that Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 15(b) applies in habeas, right?\nMS. BUNN: That was a basis of its holding, yes.\nThat's correct, on debatability.\nQUESTION: Is - is that absolutely clear?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it's not, and it -\nQUESTION: Well, if it's not absolutely clear,\nthen - then it seems to me they should have - they should\nhave granted the - the certificate of appealability.\nMS. BUNN: The issue actually before the Fifth\nCircuit, the issue that it resolved, was whether - whether\nit was debatable - the district court - whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying the 59(e)\nmotion, because, in fact, the district court never\nconsidered 15(b) because it was never raised to the\ndistrict court, that - that particular argument. So -\nQUESTION: Well, that wasn't the basis that the\nFifth Circuit relied on. I thought it relied on the basis\nthat there's huge - there's just no question that 15(b)\ndoesn't apply in habeas.\nMS. BUNN: That was part -\nQUESTION: And there's a lot of question about\nthat, it seems to me.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. That was part of the\nholding. The stated -\nQUESTION: So maybe we should remand at - at\nleast on the, you know, on the - on the Cook claim to have\nthe - the Fifth Circuit decide whether a COA - decide the\n15(b) question and then decide the Cook claim.\nMS. BUNN: I believe that would be an appropriate\ncourse on this issue, and in this - we are not - we are\nconceding the debatability of the general applicability of\n15(b) in the habeas context. What we do not find to be -\nwhat we do not believe to be debatable is the\napplicability in this case, that essentially there's no\nfactual predicate for the application of 15(b) in this\ncase, given that there's - there's simply nothing in the\nrecord to show that any party beside Bank himself,\nincluding the judge - the lower court judges, had any\ninkling that this issue was properly before them.\nQUESTION: But the Fifth Circuit passed on it,\ndidn't it? Didn't the Fifth Circuit pass on the question\nof whether 15(b) applied?\nMS. BUNN: The Fifth Circuit, after - after\nnoting that what the Fifth - that - that the district\ncourt's findings regarding the failure to raise the claim,\nthe failure to raise it in an amended petition, did hold\nthat it was - that it - that 15(b) did not apply in the\nhabeas context.\nQUESTION: There was one position you took in\nyour brief and you said that - that the state is not\nobliged to reveal the identity of an informer. That's not\ncorrect, is it, if the informer is called as a witness?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, that is our position\nthat essentially a prosecutor's duty to disclose whatever\ninformation is triggered by the - the potential\nmateriality of that information. And particularly in a\ncase like this, where the informant is not - was not paid\nfor testimony, was not given any sort of break for his\ntestimony, that there's no specific inference that can be\ndrawn regarding an incentive for testifying favorably for\nthe state, that that is not -\nQUESTION: What authority - what authority do you\nhave? What case holds that when the Government puts an\ninformant on the stand, it does not have to divulge that\ncapacity?\nMS. BUNN: There - I know of no such authority\nfor that particular proposition, but there's also nothing\n- there's also no opinion from this Court saying that a\nwitness' informant status is per se material, which is\nessentially what - what that would -\nQUESTION: Isn't there - isn't there a Texas rule\nof evidence that says, this is 508(c)(1) of the Texas\nrules, an informer's identity must be disclosed if he\nappears as a witness for the public entity?\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, even - even\nassuming a breach of a Federal rule of - state rule of\nevidence, that would not implicate the constitutional due\nprocess concerns at issue here. And under Brady -\nQUESTION: Well - well, it certainly goes to\nwhether or not the defendant is - is entitled to rely on\nwhat the prosecution's course of conduct is with reference\nto the informer.\nMS. BUNN: But again, there's nothing in this\ntrial record to indicate that trial counsel specifically\nrequested that information prior to going to trial, that\nhe - that trial counsel himself didn't pursue -\nQUESTION: So you say at the outset of the trial\nthe defense counsel has to say, now, will you comply with\nall of the rules that are in the Texas statutes?\nMS. BUNN: Well, there is an obligation from - on\n- upon defense counsel to pursue the remedies he's\nentitled to, and to - to specifically request the\ninformant status of any witness, yes, there is an\nobligation in a case such as this. And the fact that\ntrial counsel did not do that, at least precludes a -\nQUESTION: Why is there such an obligation if the\nstate rules require it? This - we supposed to say we want\nto be sure you've complied with all the state rules that\ngovern prosecutions?\nMS. BUNN: But even assuming that - that\nviolation, that is not - that does not support itself a\nfinding of cause to the procedural default of Banks'\nfailing to develop this claim for years even though\nknowing of its existence.\nQUESTION: Ms. Bunn, do you have any argument\nthat this might not have made any difference?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and again, several\nfactors -\nQUESTION: I - I suggest you might train your\nguns on that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BUNN: Several factors play into that issue.\nAgain, just - just the pure impeachment value itself was -\nwas weakened by the fact that there was no incentive. But\nalso the fact that Farr was heavily impeached already and\nthat the informant status, weak as it was, was - was\nreally merely cumulative. Defense counsel had brought\nout, both on direct and then again on cross, his prior\ndrug abuse, track marks, his denials during cross-\nexamination, refuted by the defense witnesses, which\nincluded a denial that he acted as a police informant in -\nin another case for another jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: This isn't - this isn't what the\nprosecution told the jury, was it?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. This is - this is\nfrom defense counsel. And third, even without Farr's\ntestimony, the significant evidence of Banks' future\ndangerousness. Banks admitted at punishment that he was\nwilling to abet Farr's commission of future armed\nrobberies by providing him with the weapon. In fact, he\nwas willing to drive.\nQUESTION: But he did - is - is it correct that\nbut for Farr there would have been no testimony that Banks\nwould participate in those robberies, and there would have\nbeen no testimony that Banks and his accomplices would use\nthe gun to eliminate any trouble that might come up during\nthat. Is that correct?\nMS. BUNN: Yes. That is correct.\nQUESTION: That's pretty damning testimony, isn't\nit?\nMS. BUNN: It is a piece of - of - of the state's\npuzzle, but it - but given what is left, not material.\nAnd again, the fact that he was -\nQUESTION: It's not material because it would not\nhave, in effect, raised a serious question about the - the\nintegrity of the result or the fairness of the trial?\nMS. BUNN: Yes. It would not have put the\nstate's punishment case in such a different light as to\nundermine the verdict.\nQUESTION: Well, but don't - didn't you have a\ndefendant here without a prior criminal record, and - and\nthe state is trying to prove future dangerousness and that\nthis is a really bad actor. I would have thought that\nwent rather to the heart of the sentencing question.\nMS. BUNN: It was definitely favorable evidence\nto the state's future dangerousness case, but it was not\nall that was there.\nQUESTION: Well, you have there as well Mr.\nJefferson, who said that Banks whacked him or hit him hard\nand happened to omit that he himself, Mr. Jefferson, had\nattacked Mr. Banks' sister, which could be a reason why he\nhad hit him.\nMS. BUNN: Well, the - Vetrano Jefferson's\ntestimony, though he did amend his version of the incident\nin post-conviction proceedings, he did not recant his\ntestimony that Banks hit him across the face with a gun,\nbut only that - and not that he had attacked Banks' wife,\nbut that he had - that he had had a verbal altercation\nwith her. And there was no physical - no physical threat\nwhatsoever that Banks responded to by hitting him across\nthe face with a gun, and this happened a week prior to the\nmurder.\nAnd again, this testimony indicated that Banks\nwas known to carry a weapon on a regular basis in the\nweeks before the murder. And the murder itself, the\nunprovoked nature of it, the fact that Banks essentially\nlured a 16-year-old kid to a - an abandoned and secluded\npark near his home and shot him three times to steal his\ncar.\nAnd then - and then the fact that though -\nthough Farr's testimony was - was crucial on the limited\nissue of Banks' willingness to participate himself in the\narmed robberies, it still - still the fact that Banks had\nit - and himself admitted - admitted at punishment that he\nwas willing to abet Farr's commission of murder and had,\nin fact, been willing to drive what would have been a six-\nhour round trip to Dallas in the middle of the night to\nprocure that weapon to - to aid those -\nQUESTION: He didn't admit that - that he was\nwilling to abet murder. He just admitted he was willing\nto get the gun for robberies.\nMS. BUNN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Did he say specifically, in order that\nsomebody can be killed? He didn't say -\nMS. BUNN: He did - he did testify in - in\nresponse to cross-examination by the prosecutor that he\nwas willing to provide what could potentially be a death\nweapon in a robbery case. And in the light of this future\ndangerousness evidence that remains, as well as the\nincremental impeachment value of Farr's informant status\nwithin the context of the trial, former's informant -\nFarr's informant status wouldn't have put the state's case\nin such a different light as to undermine confidence in -\nin the jury's verdict.\nAgain, the state's duty to - to disclose in\nthese cases is triggered by the materiality of the\nevidence, and in this case, Farr's import - Farr's\ninformant status was not that kind of - of evidence. It\nwas not material evidence.\nUnless there are no further questions. Thank\nyou.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bunn.\nMr. Kendall, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KENDALL: Thank you, Your Honor. Very\nbriefly, on the Charles Cook claim, I - Ms. Bunn has\nconceded that jurors of reason would find debatable the\nrule 15 issue. We would ask that if the Court agrees with\nthat, that we not go back just to the Fifth Circuit, that\nthe case be sent back to the court in Texarkana, the\ndistrict court, for fact-finding on the underlying claim.\nThere's not been any fact-finding whatsoever on that\nclaim, and we think that would be, if the case is going\nback to the Fifth Circuit, that that would be entirely\nuseful.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kendall.\n"
