GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nParagraph 6 of section 2255 provides that,\nquote, a 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a\nmotion under this section. The limitation period shall\nrun from the latest of -- and it identifies four events,\nthe first of which is, quote, the date on which the\njudgment of conviction became final.\nCongress did not define or otherwise explicate\nwhen the judgment becomes final in that provision, and the\nquestion presented by this case is that, given that final\ncan mean many different things in different contexts, when\ndoes it -- judgment become final here?\nPetitioner agrees with the clear majority of\ncircuits and the United States that the judgment becomes\nfinal upon the conclusion of direct review or the\nexpiration of time for seeking such review. As applied to\nthis case, petitioner's time to seek 2255 relief began to\nrun when his time to seek certiorari in this Court\nexpired.\nCongress most likely intended that\ninterpretation for two reasons. First, it is the one that\nthis Court has consistently used in the most analogous\ncontext, and that is the dividing line between direct and\ncollateral review; and, second --\nQUESTION: Are you talking about now our\nretroactivity cases?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Not merely retro --\nQUESTION: The --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Those included, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but also cases like Barefoot versus Estelle,\ndealing with the presumption of correctness, and also Bell\nversus Maryland, which addresses the question of when a\nstatute is repealed, when does that repeal affect --\nwhat -- what convictions does it affect?\nQUESTION: Well, those come from quite diverse\ncontexts.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that\nis, in effect, our point. Those -- most of those\ncontexts, however, do deal with the dividing line between\ndirect and collateral review.\nThe amicus quite rightly points out that there\nare other meanings of final. We do believe, however, that\nthey don't -- they aren't as close as this one, and they\naren't the one that Congress most naturally looked to, and\nsince Congress didn't tell this Court what it meant, you\nwould look to the dividing line between direct and\ncollateral review, because that's the point of this\nprovision in section 2255.\nI mentioned there was a second reason that I'll\ncome to, and that is that the -- the minority rule doesn't\nwork textually and would produce anomalous results.\nThe -- as I mentioned, the Court has picked up\nthe notion of final -- the judgment of conviction becoming\nfinal, and that language appears almost verbatim in\nLinkletter, in contexts like Teague, Barefoot, and Bell.\nQUESTION:\nbygone era by the time Congress passed AEDPA.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, but I think\nthe point still would favor us. You're absolutely right,\nbecause although the Court has changed the line for\nretroactivity and changed the test, it has never changed\nthe definition of what is final, and so for 40 years plus\nthe Court has consistently included the time to seek\ncertiorari, and that's a perfectly sensible result, as it\nwould be applied in this case.\nThe -- the minority rule, by contrast, would\nproduce anomalous results. It would mean, for example,\nthat in the couple of months after the mandate issues in\nthe court of appeals, a judgment of conviction would be\nboth final and non-final at the same time, because you\nwouldn't -- although the statute refers to the judgment of\nconviction becoming final, you wouldn't actually know at\nthat point.\nQUESTION: I thought that their -- amicus wrote,\nyou know, a pretty good argument on that side, and I\nthought one of his better points, which is that if we're\nlooking at the -- the 1-year limitation from a person in\nState proceedings, what it says is, it runs from the\nlatest of the date on which judgment became final by the\nconclusion of direct review, or the expiration of time for\nseeking such review; and then when you look to the\nparallel for somebody in Federal proceedings, it says it\nbecomes final from the date on which the judgment of\nconviction becomes final.\nIn other words, they use the first half of the\nsentence, doesn't use the sentence -- the second; and in -\n- in the State proceeding it has two, and here it has one,\nand he says you have to give some meaning to that\ndifference.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand. Justice Breyer,\nthat is exactly what has caused the Fourth and Seventh\nCircuits to scratch their head. It's a conceivable\ninference. We don't dispute that.\nOf course, the majority of courts have applied\nanother canon of construction here, and that is that when\nCongress uses the same phrase in a statute, it's\ninterpreted generally, absent some strong contrary\nindication, to have the same meaning.\nQUESTION: Oh, no, it doesn't, see, because you\nhave became final by the conclusion of direct review, and\nthen we have the date on which judgment of conviction\nbecame final, and he's saying that he would interpret it\nso they mean the same thing.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Ah, but he wouldn't, and here's\nthe reason, and let -- let me just take you very carefully\nthrough this, and for anyone who wants to look it up, it's\nthe blue brief on page 1 would be the different statutory\nprovisions.\n2255 says, the limitation period shall run from\nthe latest of the date on which the judgment of conviction\nbecame final. According to the amicus, that means the\ndate on which the mandate issues.\n2244(d)(1) says -- has the -- has that, and it\nhas some more, and that's your point. The limitation\nperiod shall run from the latest of the date on which the\njudgment became final, and then he gives that -- that same\nphrase, judgment became final, a different meaning in the\nsame statute. He reads that to mean either review in this\nCourt, or the expiration of time to seek cert, so it\ndoes -- it would have actually a -- that phrase, judgment\nbecame final, would have a different meaning in 22 --\nQUESTION: Well, but the -- the -- that\ndoesn't -- the sentence doesn't end with judgment became\nfinal. It goes on to say, by the conclusion of direct\nreview, or the expiration of the time for seeking such\nreview.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right, so what we have,\nMr. Chief Justice, is 2244, Congress explicates a phrase.\n2255, it doesn't explicate it at all, and our --\nQUESTION: So you are saying that in the --\nwithin 2244(d)(1), those words are surplusage, they don't\ndo anything, that -- the -- that 2244 would mean the same\nthing if there were a period after \"became final.\"\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, it is correct\nthat we think it would mean the same thing even if it\nweren't there, but it's not surplusage. It does have a\nrole, and so I have several reasons to articulate to the\nCourt why there's no negative pregnant -- our view is, and\nthis Court has said, not every silence is pregnant. What\nwe have in 2255 is silent.\nMy point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the\ninference that the minority of courts draw, that Congress\nwas doing something special in 2244, and therefore\nimpliedly didn't intend to do the same thing in 2255, is\nnot correct, and I have several points.\nThe first one goes to yours, Justice Ginsburg,\nand that is, it's reasonable for this Court to ask, okay,\nwhy did it put it in 2244 and it didn't put it in 2255?\nIt would have been easier, obviously, if it had put it in\n2255.\nThe reason we think they put it in 2244 is not\nto specify which among the Federal interpretations of\n\"judgment becomes final\" applies, but to say that it's the\nFederal one, not the State one.\nThat's the real difference of force between 2244\ninstead of 2255.\ncases come out of the State courts,\nand State courts define finality differently, and so what\nCongress did there in 44 was make quite clear that they\nwere applying the Federal rule.\nThat was very important in particular, because\nState proceedings have the added complication of not just\nState direct review, but State post-conviction review, and\nso Federal habeas courts could be terribly confused on\nwhen the judgment and --\nQUESTION: But -- but you're going to get State\npost-conviction review in connection with Federal habeas\ncases because of the exhaustion requirement.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that\nis our point, and that is that Congress really needed to\ndo a better -- a very good job, as -- as good as they did\nin AEDPA in any context, but they needed to do a good job\nin telling Federal habeas cases in the 20 -- courts in the\n2244 context when the judgment of conviction became final,\nbecause if 20 --\nQUESTION: Well, but you can also say that they\nhad to give a special meaning of finality so that we could\nrespect the processes of the States and make it clear that\nthe -- all of the State procedures had to be exhausted, as\nthe Chief Justice indicated, because of the intrusive\nnature of -- of habeas jurisprudence, of habeas orders\nfrom the Federal courts, and so you can read this as -- as\nbeing an exception to this general Federal rule when, in\nfact -- that brings me to another point -- you can address\nboth.\nI -- I had -- I had thought, as the amicus brief\ndoes indicate, that finality usually does mean from the\ndate of the issuance of the mandate, and then you go back\nand you toll if there's -- if there's discretionary\nreview.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, this is the\nsecond point on the question of do -- does this Court have\nsome reason to believe that the presence in 24 -- excuse\nme, 44 but not 55 creates a negative inference, the sort\nof Russello presumption, and I agree with you that it\nwould rest on a view that this interpretation in 44(d)(1)\nis unusual, and our point is that it's not unusual.\nYou are correct that the -- the -- as they said\nin Melconian, for example, that the term of art, final\njudgment, does generally mean the judgment of the district\ncourt, but everyone agrees that that's not the\ninterpretation here. In fact, it's very clear that the --\nthe phrase here, if I could again take you back to -- take\nyou back to it in 2255, is judgment of conviction becomes\nfinal. That phrase, judgment of conviction, picks up\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.\nJudgment of conviction includes the conviction,\nthe judgment of conviction and the sentence, and it is by\nnecessity already final and appealable. If this Court\nwere to say that the baseline rule is final judgment in\nthe sense of a district court, that would mean in the 2255\ncontext that, although your -- your direct appeal could be\nsitting here in the Seventh Circuit for 2 years, after the\nfirst year, you need to be back in the district court on\n2255, because the judgment of conviction would have become\nfinal when it was entered by the district court, and no\none thinks that's sensible.\nIn fact, the -- the notes to rule 5 of the -- of\nthe 2255 rules make quite clear you're not supposed to be\nin on your 2255 until the direct review process is over,\nso that -- my point was that the -- what you're describing\nas the normal background rule of when a judgment of\nconviction becomes final actually describes the term\n\"final judgment,\" which couldn't apply here.\nQUESTION: When you're -- when you're appealing\nfrom the district court to the court of appeals, when does\nthe term, final -- what does the term of final mean there,\nas to the district court judgment?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In this -- in -- in our view,\nunder 2255, Mr. Chief Justice, or --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN:\nin our view. What happens is, if you did not appeal, it\nwould -- the judgment of conviction would become final\nafter the 10 days --\nQUESTION: Well, characterize for -- for us,\nthen, your understanding of the amicus view. I thought\ntheir view is that it just becomes tolled. The minute\nyou -- the minute you file the appeal it becomes tolled,\nso there's no problem.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. -- Justice Kennedy,\nI do agree with you that that's the amicus's view. Our\npoint is that it doesn't pick up what you're describing as\nthe normal rule of final judgment. That wouldn't be the\nnormal process. Our point is that the most --\nQUESTION: Oh, I should think the normal rule\ndoes include the tolling exception that I -- that I --\nwe've just explained.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, as a matter\nof -- for example, Melconian, if we go back to what this\nCourt has described as the normal background\nunderstanding, the normal background understanding is that\njust when it's entered by the district court; but if,\nagain if I could come back to my basic point, and that is,\nwe all agree final can mean a lot of things, and the\nclosest one, it seems perfectly clear, is the one that\ndivides direct and collateral review, because that's what\nthis provision does.\nI won't deny to you, Justice Kennedy, that it\ncould mean different things. But no one -- and my third\npoint I wanted to make, Justice Ginsburg, about why you\nshouldn't draw negative inferences, nobody's got a good\nreason. Nobody's got a reason to think that Congress\nwould have wanted this time to be available to State\nprisoners, but not to Federal prisoners.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Goldstein.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a defendant does not petition this Court\nfor certiorari on direct appeal, his judgment of\nconviction becomes final within the meaning of section\n2255 when the time for filing a petition expires. That\ninterpretation accords with the well-settled meaning of\nfinal and the law of collateral review, and it sensibly\nprovides Federal prisoners the same time to prepare\ncollateral attacks as similarly situated State prisoners.\nQUESTION: What about an appeal from the\ndistrict court to the court of appeals?\nMR. ROBERTS: The judgment would become final if\nthere -- if no appeal was filed at the time -- when the\ntime to file an appeal expired after the 10-day period.\nQUESTION: And yet that's contrary to a lot of\nother things, is it not? I mean, you can't go into the\ndistrict court 60 days after your time -- after the\ndistrict final judgment was entered and still maybe have\n30 more days to appeal, and the district court isn't going\nto do anything.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we're talking about finality\nfor -- for a different purpose here. It's not a question\nof finality for the purpose of seeking appeal, or when a\njudgment -- in the term like final judgment, which is --\nwhich would be the sense of finality when, for the\npurposes of deciding --\nQUESTION: Why -- why should those be different?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, in -- in terms of -- of\ncollateral review, first of all the Congress used the\nparticular phrase, when the judgment becomes final, that\nhas an established meaning in that context. Second of\nall, it's logical that the time to commence collateral\nreview should start to run at the conclusion of direct\nreview, which this Court has made clear includes the\nperiod when -- within which to seek certiorari even if a\npetition isn't filed, and that's, in fact, what Congress\nconcluded in section 2244, the parallel provision for\nState prisoners, and there's no persuasive reason why\nCongress would have started the -- the time limitation at\na different time for Federal prisoners.\nQUESTION: Except that -- except that they wrote\nthe two sections differently. That -- that certainly is\nsomething of a reason.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that -- that -- well, I'm\ntalking about a -- a reason why they would have intended\nthat result as opposed to a -- a canon or a textual\nindication that there might be a difference, but even as\nto the textual indication --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I thought they would\nintend it in order to show special respect for the\nprocesses of the State, so that a State has completely\nexhausted all of its procedures for determining what the\nlaw ought to be --\nMR. ROBERTS: But --\nQUESTION: -- before they're disrupted by a\nFederal judgment.\nMR. ROBERTS: But this doesn't concern the\nprocesses of the State, Your Honor, it concerns review\nin -- in this Court, and this Court's made clear the --\nthe distinction of the time is between whether the -- the\ntime to seek review in this Court is included or is not\nincluded, and that's not a -- a State -- a remedy, this\nCourt's made clear that exhaustion of State remedies\ndoesn't require a petitioner to seek review in this Court,\nthat State remedies are exhausted as long as all avenues\nof review are pursued in -- in the State court system. So\nconcerns about -- concerns about requiring them to go\nthrough the full State court system wouldn't justify the\ndifference in the rule, nor would generalized concerns\nabout comity, which would suggest that State prisoners\nought to have less time to seek review from their\nconvictions, if -- if anything, to upset their State court\nconvictions, rather than -- than more time.\nAnd really, collateral review rules are driven\nmore by finality concerns, which are equally strong in the\nFederal context and the State context. That's why the\nTeague retroactivity rules and rules of procedural default\napply equally to both, and because finality concerns are\nthe same, there -- there isn't any persuasive reason why\nCongress would have started the time limit at a different\ntime.\nThe negative -- the negative inference points,\nto address the negative inference point, there are three\nreasons why it would be inappropriate to draw a negative\ninference from the omission of the clarifying language\nhere.\nused final in accordance with its settled meaning in the\ncollateral review context, which petitioner discussed\nearlier.\nQUESTION: But I -- I think, Mr. Roberts, that\nas I pointed out in the question to petitioner's counsel,\n2250 -- 44(d)(1) doesn't just stop with the word, final,\nit goes on to kind of explicate the possible -- possible\nmeanings.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, it explicates the meanings,\nbut it explicates the meanings by providing the definition\nthat is the -- is -- by providing an explication that's\nconsistent with the background definition that you would\nexpect final to have, and there's a -- there are good\nreasons why Congress would have -- might have wanted to\nexplicate the -- to explicate it more carefully in 2244.\nPetitioner discussed one, which is that 2244\nconcerned State prisoners, and Congress might have been\nconcerned that, absent clarification, courts might import\nthe definition of finality used by the State of\nconviction, and there are varying definitions there.\nThere's not the uniform definition that would include\nreview in this Court.\nSecond, it's possible that Congress might have\nbeen concerned that the courts would assume that the time\nlimit in section 2244 starts to run the same time as the\ntime limit in section 2263, which also concerns State\nprisoners, State capital defendants and States subject to\nexpedited collateral review proceedings, and so\nCongress --\nQUESTION: Do you --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- may have spelled it out here.\nQUESTION: Do you think it makes any difference\nthat in 2255 Congress used the phrase, judgment of\nconviction, and in 2244(d)(1) it simply used the word,\njudgment?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, I -- I don't think that it\nmakes a difference. There are variations in -- in\nlanguage like that.\nQUESTION: Well, usually variations in language\nmean variations in meaning.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor, but it's\nreferring back to the judgment of the State court under\nwhich the person is in custody. The -- the provision\n2244(d)(1) is reproduced in the gray brief on page 2 to 3.\nSo where it says the date on which the judgment\nbecame final, it's -- it's referring back to a -- a person\nwho's in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\ncourt, and that would be the judgment of the district\ncourt -- I mean, of the trial court in -- in that\nsituation, but fundamentally, our points are two.\nOne, there's a background rule, and the\npresumption is generally of -- of what -- when a judgment\nbecomes final in the collateral review context, and it's\ngenerally presumed, with good reason, that Congress\nlegislates against that background rule and uses the terms\nwith their settled meaning in that context; and second, we\nknow Congress did that with respect to State prisoners in\nsection 2244 because they clarified it there; and it makes\nsense that the time limitation should run at the same\ntime, because there's no persuasive reason for them to run\nat a different time.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, refresh my recollection.\nWas 2255 and 22 -- and 2240(d)(1) enacted as part of the\nsame statute?\nMR. ROBERTS: They were enacted as part of\nthe -- the same statute, Your Honor, but the -- the\nproposition that the same word has the same meaning, the\nsame word becomes final, has the same meaning throughout\nthe statute -- same statute would apply by virtue of that.\nSo the -- so that we would expect that when Congress said,\nbecomes final in section 22 -- 2255, and when it said,\nbecame final in 2244, both referring to a judgment of the\ntrial court convicting the defendant, that it -- it\nintended those phrases to have the same meaning.\nQUESTION: I wouldn't think that. I would -- I\nwould think that where you say, on the one hand, where it\nbecomes final by (a) or (b), and elsewhere you simply say,\nwhere it becomes final --\nMR. ROBERTS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- I would think that the latter\nmeans, even if it becomes final in some other fashion.\nNow, that happens not -- that happens not to\nhelp the respondent here.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: But I -- but I do think that that's\nthe more natural --\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that -- that would be one\npossibility, that here it was restricted --\nQUESTION: Don't you think that's the more\nnatural --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- but it was broader.\nQUESTION: That's right, broader.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, but it's hard for me to\nconceive, frankly, what the broader --\nQUESTION: What the broader would be.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- understanding of finality is,\nYour Honor. I do think that -- that not every time\nthat -- that Congress uses the different language to --\nthat's more amplified and clarifying, does that -- that\nmean that --\nQUESTION: Not necessarily.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- that the words -- and the Court\ndoes not generally -- does not generally apply the\nnegative inference, the Russello presumption to draw the\nconclusion that the -- that identical phrases have -- have\ndifferent meaning.\nQUESTION: Oh, if -- if you applied the Russello\npresumption here, you -- you would be applying the\npresumption that I just described, namely in -- in one\nsection, it limited it, in -- in the other section, it\ndidn't limit it at all. You'd think the latter section\nwould be broader, not narrower.\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that would be --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's what Russello said.\nMR. ROBERTS: That would be parallel to Russello\nand parallel to some other cases where there's been\nadditional limiting language, and the Court has said\ntherefore, the -- we won't read that limit into the\nearlier language, but in those cases also what bears note\nis that the word that was limited later on, here the word\nbecomes -- the phrase becomes final, was by the Court, in\nthose cases, given its ordinary meaning, what you would\nexpect, apart from the Russello presumption.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what I --\nMR. ROBERTS: And here --\nQUESTION: That gets you into the argument of\nwhether there is an ordinary meaning of final.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, and there\nisn't -- there isn't an ordinary meaning across the board\nin every context, but here we have a -- a narrow context\nin which Congress has acted in the collateral review\ncontext, in particular in the commencement of collateral\nreview, and in this Court's cases, in the collateral\nreview context, particularly delineating when direct\nreview ends and collateral review begins, the Court has\nused repeatedly, over 30 years before enactment of AEDPA,\nthe -- this established definition of finality, and\nthere's -- there's no reason why Congress would have\ndeparted from that here.\nIf there are no further questions, we would\nsubmit.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. de Bruin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. DE BRUIN,\nAMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW\nMR. DE BRUIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are four points that are dispositive of\nthis case. First, the most natural and logical inference\nis that the textual language in section 2255 cannot mean\nexactly the same thing as the very different textual\nlanguage enacted at the same time in the same statute in\nsection 2244. Second, the text of each provision has an\nordinary and accepted meaning that is not, in fact, the\nsame. Third, there are at least three reasons why\nCongress logically used a different trigger for the\nlimitation periods in section 2244 and 2255, and fourth,\nno harmful or absurd consequences flow from a\ndetermination that Congress did not intend these very\ndifferent provisions with their very different texts to\nmean precisely the same thing, as the parties here\ncontend, and for these reasons, I submit the judgment of\nthe court of appeals in this case is correct, and it\nshould be affirmed.\nThe Russello presumption in this case is\nparticularly strong. Congress, in fact, used three\ndifferent formulations in AEDPA in identifying triggers\nfor time limitations under the statute, 2244, 2255, as\nwe've talked about, and also 2263. In each of those\nformulations, enacted in the same statute at the same\ntime, Congress explicitly chose different words to\ndescribe what the triggering event was and what the\nconsequences of subsequent events were.\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's review the Russello\npresumption.\nmore general word was limited. What -- what was the --\nwhat was the -- the -- what was the general word involved\nin that case?\nMR. DE BRUIN: I believe -- I have the exact\nlanguage, that in Russello, the -- the general was any\ninterest acquired.\nQUESTION: Any -- any interest acquired. That's\nwhat the later provision said, and the earlier provision\nsaid, any interest in the enterprise acquired.\nMR. DE BRUIN: Correct, any interest in any\nenterprise which the defendant has established.\nQUESTION: Okay, and -- and what Russello said\nis, where you have a limitation in the earlier one, an\ninterest in any enterprise, and then the later one just\nsays, any interest, we assume that any interest is\nbroader. It's not limited by, in any enterprise.\nNow, if you apply -- and I think that's entirely\nreasonable, but if you apply that same principle here,\nwhat it comes to is that where in the early one it says\nfinal by reason of (a) and (b), and in the later one, it\njust says, becomes final, you would think the later one\nwould -- would include (a), (b), and maybe (c), (d), (e),\nbut it certainly wouldn't be narrower than the earlier\none, which is what you're insisting it is.\nIn other words, it seems to me Russello cuts\nexactly against your position, rather than for it.\nMR. DE BRUIN: Well, I think the -- the meaning\nof becomes final in 2255 is, in a sense, broader, in that\nthere are different conditions that can trigger when a\njudgment becomes final. The -- the normal rule is that\njudgments of courts become final when the court acts, not\nupon the expiration of review. That finality, however,\nmay be disrupted, or arrested by subsequent filings.\nQUESTION: But aren't you picking one of the two\nmeans of finality that's set forth in the earlier\nprovision? You're saying in the later provision it only\nmeans one of those two. That's not Russello at all.\nThat's the opposite of Russello.\nMR. DE BRUIN: No --\nQUESTION: I -- I think what you'd have to say\nis, it means those two perhaps plus some others.\nMR. DE BRUIN: No, for two reasons. One,\nCongress logically can include the first phrase, the\nconclusion of direct review, as a means of clarifying and\ncontrasting its inclusion of the second or the expiration\nof the time for seeking such review.\nThat is the unusual clause. Typically,\njudgments become final when the court acts. They're not\ndependent upon the expiration of the time for review for\nfinality to attach.\nQUESTION: Or on the issuance of a mandate.\nMR. DE BRUIN: But that is an action of the\ncourt, Justice Ginsburg. In other words, the point is,\nand the parties agree that the word final does have\ndifferent meanings in different contexts.\nQUESTION: It surely does.\nMR. DE BRUIN: And -- and I don't dispute that,\nbut in this case, I think you have to look at final, and\nit is guided by two things. The meaning of final in 2255\nis informed by the language in 2244, where Congress\nprovided a very specific definition there that it did not\nemploy in 2255.\nQUESTION: You seem to take only one part of the\ndefinition, because 2244 says, on direct review, or the\nexpiration, but you seem to accept that 2255 does\nencompass direct review. That is, if someone actually\nfiles a petition for cert, then the finality rule would\nnot kick in.\nMR. DE BRUIN: Justice Ginsburg, that is not\nactually clear. It is not clear that Congress in 2255\nintended either formulation to be the defining point in\nall cases. Under Rule 33, there was very similar language\nthat triggered a time bar to -- to when the judgment\nbecame final and, as interpreted by the courts there,\nfinality was not always coextensive with the conclusion of\ndirect review.\nThe rule there, universally established, was\nthat if a court of appeals issued its mandate and a stay\nof the mandate was not obtained, the 2-year clock under\nRule 33 began to run from the date of the mandate whether\nor not the defendant, not having obtained a stay,\npetitioned this Court for certiorari. So although the\nquestion is not presented in this case, it is not\nautomatically clear that Congress in 2255 meant either of\nthe triggers that appear in 2244, but, as this Court\nrecognized in Russello, these provisions do not need to be\nmutually coextensive. One can be a subset of the other.\nIn this instance, Congress could include the\nwords, the conclusion of direct review, simply to provide\nclarity that it also wanted to include the unusual event,\nwhich was the expiration of the time for seeking such\nreview.\nQUESTION: You would also -- what -- they --\nthey also -- the Government gave meaning to the -- gave\nmeaning to the difference by saying, even if you're right\nabout that, becomes final, becomes final includes\nexpiration of time. That's their argument.\nAnd as to the first thing, by direct review,\nthat includes expiration of time, too. They just put it\nin to make sure it was not the habeas route in the States,\nand then they put the second clause in really to save\nFederal judges from being confused about what happens in\nthe California Court of Appeals, what happens in the lower\ninter -- intermediate State courts to make sure that --\nthat this ordinary Federal situation was seen as applying\nto cases as they wend their way up through the State court\nsystem, too.\nMR. DE BRUIN: What is --\nQUESTION: I think that's -- that was -- I heard\nthat being given, in any case. Are you following? Was I\nclear enough?\nMR. DE BRUIN: Yes, I believe.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DE BRUIN: But what is significant, Justice\nBreyer, is that that argument essentially undercuts their\nargument that Congress, in enacting 2255, was using an\nestablished meaning of final, coming from this Court's\nprecedents in their retroactivity cases.\nIf Congress believed that the word final, as\nused in 2255, standing alone, without clarification,\nautomatically conveyed the definition this Court has used\nin the retroactivity cases, that definition, as this Court\nknows, applies equally to State convictions as well as to\nFederal convictions. In fact, that rule in Linkletter was\noriginally developed in the context of review of a State\nconviction. In Griffith, the Court applied that same\nconcept of finality both to a State conviction and to a\nFederal conviction, so if Congress thought by using just\nthe word final, we mean, in essence, the retroactivity\ndefinition --\nQUESTION: If you -- if you --\nMR. DE BRUIN: -- that would have applied to\nboth.\nBut conversely, if Congress was aware that that\nword, final, might mean something different, then the\nobvious differences in wording here make a meaningful\ndifference. 2244 means what Congress specified.\nThe point is, there is no greater reason to\nbelieve that the Court's definition in the retroactivity\ncases applies in 2255 but not 2244.\nQUESTION: Right. If -- if, in fact, you could\nread it, as Justice Scalia suggested, which I think maybe\nyou could, or as the way the SG suggested for the sake of\nargument, is there any argument that you shouldn't?\nI mean, it sounds simple, clear, uniform; everybody'd\nunderstand it. Is there any reason not to read it that\nway if the language permits it?\nMR. DE BRUIN: I think what you have done is,\nyou've rendered the words of section 2244, as Justice\nGinsburg pointed out, wholly superfluous.\nQUESTION: All right, but then you're answering\nmy question, no. You're saying, there is no reason not to\nread it that way if you could, with the language, but the\nlanguage doesn't permit it.\nMR. DE BRUIN: I --\nQUESTION: That's your argument.\nMR. DE BRUIN: I believe that's correct. I\nbelieve --\nQUESTION: And I take it as a no, that if it did\npermit it, there isn't any good reason.\nMR. DE BRUIN: I think Congress certainly could\nhave enacted a statute that had the same trigger. I think\nthere also are significant reasons why it made sense for\nCongress not to use the same trigger. There are --\nQUESTION: It wouldn't render that language\nsuperfluous if you interpreted it the way I suggested,\nwhich is that -- that finality in the second provision\nincludes not just the two specifications in the first, but\nalso some other unnamed aspects of finality, which we\ndon't have to decide upon in this case, but which doesn't\nhelp your case.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean --\nMR. DE BRUIN: Justice Scalia, what --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. DE BRUIN:\nthere isn't anything else. There isn't a broader universe\nthat --\nQUESTION: If -- if you're -- if you're going to\nsay that 2255, by contrast with 2244(d)(1) must mean\nsomething broader, then -- though, the broader you define\nfinality, the more difficult it is for a petitioner to\nmake his case, it seems to me -- a habeas petitioner. If\nthere are any number of different ways that a judgment can\nbecome final, that -- that is bad for the person seeking\nhabeas relief.\nMR. DE BRUIN: I think that's right. As,\nMr. Chief Justice, you recognized, the habeas -- there --\nthere's an interest in setting the date and in a non-\ncapital case, as these cases will be, where certiorari has\nnot been sought, if claims are to be brought, have the\nstatute begin, the claims be filed, if relief is\nappropriate, relief be granted; but what I think is\nsignificant, Justice Scalia, is that there is no broader\nmeaning of final that anyone has ever articulated.\nThe -- the broadest definition that has been\nidentified is that which is set forth in 2244, the\nconclusion of direct review, or, what is not normally\nincluded for finality, the expiration of the time for\nseeking the conclusion of direct review, as opposed --\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION: I suppose you could answer Justice\nScalia by saying that these are exceptions to the ordinary\nrule of finality, although the statute doesn't quite read\nthat way. They're -- they -- or they are special\nextensions --\nMR. DE BRUIN: They --\nQUESTION: -- of the ordinary rule of finality.\nMR. DE BRUIN: I -- I -- they're extensions, is\nexactly right, but I think it is clear that finality\nnormally occurs when a court acts. Here, when the court\nof appeals issued its mandate, nothing else happened in\nthe case. Mr. Clay did not --\nQUESTION: Mr. de Bruin, I'd like to take you\nback to that word, mandate, because finality means\ndifferent things in different contexts. The most basic\nfinality rule is when the district court disassociates\nitself from the case, and then the case is lodged on\nappeal. It's final for, say, preclusion purposes at that\npoint.\nThis Court dates from, not from the mandate in\nthe court of appeals, but take, for example, our rule on\ncert. Doesn't it run from the entry of judgment in the\ncourt of appeals, not from the later time when a mandate\nis issued?\nMR. DE BRUIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: So where do you make up the mandate\nrule as a general rule?\nMR. DE BRUIN: Well, two points. One, I believe\n2244 makes clear that whatever 2255 means, it can't mean\nexactly the same thing as 2244, because Congress didn't\nuse those words. That still leaves the question, well,\nwhat, then, does becomes final mean in 2255? Does it mean\nwhen the court of appeals issues its judgment? Does it\nmean when it issues its mandate? Those questions still\nneed to be answered.\nQUESTION: Am I right that our rules don't refer\nto the mandate date at all, that it's always the entry of\njudgment?\nMR. DE BRUIN: That is correct. The 90-day\nclock runs from the -- from the entry of judgment, not the\nmandate, but in deciding that question, what did Congress\nmean by final, assuming it's not what it said in 2244.\nBecause it didn't say that here, the Court has to decide,\nis it the judgment, is it the mandate, and there is, in\nfact, a developed body of law under, I submit, a very\nanalogous situation. Under Rule 33, the defendant had\n2 years from final judgment to bring a claim, and the\ncourts had interpreted finality in that context to mean\nwhen the court of appeals issued its mandate.\nQUESTION:\nif, indeed, there was a generally understood meaning of\nfinality, and -- and that's the part of your brief I\nfocused on, and I just don't think you carry the day.\nI just think, as Justice Ginsburg points out, it means a\nlot of different things. So once that's the case, all you\nhave to rely upon is this principle that -- that where --\nwhere a thing is said two different ways in a statute,\nthere must be a reason. You have to give them different\nmeaning. That isn't an absolute principle, and it -- it\nhas all sorts of exceptions. I mean, it -- it just\ndepends.\nFor example, if you say, from the day of entry\nof judgment in one section of the statute, and in another\nsection of the statute it reads, from the day judgment was\nentered, do you really think you have to give different\nmeaning to those two formulations? Of course not. It all\ndepends on what -- what the other factors involved are,\nand here --\nMR. DE BRUIN: I think --\nQUESTION: -- I don't see any other factor,\nunless you show that finality has a normal meaning,\nwhich -- so that the earlier provision is giving it some\npeculiar meaning. That -- that would be persuasive --\nMR. DE BRUIN: I agree with you --\nQUESTION:\nthe day on that point.\nMR. DE BRUIN: I agree with you that Russello\nsets a presumption, it's not an automatic rule, but what\nis significant in this case is not just that there's a\nformulation that appears essentially the same, but in\ndifferent words. What you have is two provisions, 2244\nand 2255, that are markedly parallel. You cannot read\nthem, going along almost word-for-word, and then you get\nto this difference -- which is not a minor difference, but\nthere's an entire qualifying clause added -- and not be\nstruck: \"Congress must have meant something different or\nthey would not have diverged so significantly.\"\nQUESTION: But you admit that for one part of\nthat clause, Congress didn't mean any different. The --\nif there is a petition filed, if there is, in fact, a cert\npetition filed, then State and Federal prisoners got\ntreated alike, so it's the -- the only place, as I\nunderstand it, where you're saying there's a difference is\nwhether the time for filing a petition counts even when\nthe -- there -- no petition is filed.\nMR. DE BRUIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nconcede that. I don't concede that it is true that if a\npetition is filed, that the clock is automatically\narrested so that automatically the conclusion of direct\nreview isn't counted.\nbecause there was no petition, it may be Congress did not\nmean for either of those clauses to be in all cases the\ndeterminative fact under 2255.\nQUESTION: So under your reading, it might be\nthat the judgment becomes final, the court of appeals\njudgment becomes final when the mandate comes down, even\nthough the petitioner has filed a cert petition. It could\nmean that.\nMR. DE BRUIN: It could mean that, and that was,\nin fact, the established rule under Rule 33, which is a\nvery similar time mechanism, and I submit the most\nappropriate context is, look at other congressional\nenactments imposing time limits on the bringing of claims\nafter judgment, and the rule under Rule 33 was cert was\nirrelevant unless a stay of the mandate was obtained under\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41; and, of course,\nunder 41(c) you can obtain a stay of the mandate if a\nsubstantial question exists for the presentation of a\npetition for certiorari.\nQUESTION: Am I wrong in thinking that the\ngeneral understanding is that when you file a cert\npetition, that the finality is suspended until that\npetition is disposed of?\nMR. DE BRUIN: I don't believe that is a general\nrule.\nthe Speedy Trial Act and under Rule 33, was that simply\npetitioning this Court for certiorari did not\nautomatically arrest the finality of a judgment for either\nof those two statutes: only if you got a stay of the\nmandate. That's the whole purpose under Rule 41(c) for\nproviding for a stay of the mandate; and, of course, it's\nthat rule that the simple filing of a petition, that's\nwhat may engender meritorious petitions, which the\nGovernment contends is a reason not to interpret 2255 the\nway the court of appeals did below.\nIt makes sense, I submit, not to have a rule\nthat the automatic filing arrests the finality of the\njudgment, and that was, in fact, the rule under Rule 33,\nand that's the way the Speedy Trial Act has been\ninterpreted, and other statutes of limitations, that the\nfiling for cert does not automatically trigger the -- or\ndisrupt the statute.\nQUESTION: Mr. de Bruin, I think I understand\nyour argument based on the different wording, but --\nI think this question was asked before, too: is there any\nreason why Congress might want to give Federal\npost-conviction petitioners less time than State\npost-conviction petitioners?\nMR. DE BRUIN: Yes, but first I must correct\nyou.\nFederal prisoners have more time, not less, and the reason\nfor that, it is wrong for the parties to argue, as they\ndo, that this construction of 2255 is necessary to ensure\nparity. There is no parity.\nAs the Court knows from its decision in Duncan\nversus Walker, and just last term in Carey versus Saffold,\nthe 1-year statute under 2244 applies to the preparation\nof two different things. It applies to the preparation of\nyour State collateral petition, and then once that is\nfiled, but only after it's filed, there is tolling, as was\nat issue in Duncan versus Walker and Carey versus Saffold;\nand then after the State petition is resolved, but not\nincluding certiorari, that's very clear, then you've got\nto file your Federal 2254 petition. So a State inmate has\none year to do both, prepare his State collateral claim,\nassuming total exhaustion under Rose versus Lundy, and\nthen, after the State collateral petition is resolved, the\nFederal collateral petition.\nThe Federal inmate, by contrast, has a full year\nsimply to bring his 2255 motion. So it is not true that\nonly by forcing this different language in 2244 and 2255\nto mean the same thing, will you achieve parity. There\nisn't parity. Federal inmates have more time. But there\nare, in any event, reasons for that difference.\nAgain, claims coming from State court by\ndefinition must be exhausted, previously litigated claims.\nBy definition, 2255 claims cannot be the same claims that\nwere litigated on direct review. I submit it makes\nlogical sense for Congress to allow the State claim,\npreviously litigated in State court, to run its full\ncourse at least through cert on direct review before\nstarting the statute.\nIf this -- and I submit Teague here really\nprovides a reason. Since this Court has recognized that\nif it were to issue a new rule of constitutional procedure\nbefore the time expired to file for cert, and if one of\nthe petitioner's State claims was litigated on direct\nreview, it is less an affront to the State system for this\nCourt to simply grant, vacate, and remand than for a lower\nFederal court to take up that claim on habeas. So\nCongress logically could have said that the time to begin\nthe statute will not run until the expiration of time for\nthe conclusion of direct review. There are reasons such\nas that that could provide an explanation for why Congress\ndid what it did, which is to provide very different\ntriggers in these two statutes.\nFourth, it's important that there are no harmful\nconsequences that follow from granting these two different\nprovisions, with their very different text, different\nmeanings.\nhave at least one full year from the issuance of the\nmandate to bring their claim. As this Court has\nrecognized, in a non-capital case, the defendant has no\ninterest in delaying the adjudication of any collateral\nclaims that may exist. The construction of the court of\nappeals in this case is clear and easy to administer. The\nFederal inmate has one year from the issuance of the\nmandate if not --\nQUESTION: Well, it isn't clear on the point\nthat I asked you about, because I thought that the court\nof appeals said yes, if you actually file your petition\nfor cert, then the time doesn't run until the petition is\ndisposed of. I thought -- you -- you said that's\nambiguous, but I don't think that that's what the court\nof appeals said.\nMR. DE BRUIN: You are correct, Justice\nGinsburg. The courts of appeals have held universally\nthat if you petition for cert, the 1-year period does not\nbegin to run until the petition is resolved, and that rule\nis not presented here. There is, in fact -- authority\ngoes both ways, that subsequent filings in a different\ncourt at times do arrest the finality of a prior judgment,\nand at times they do not.\nMy only point was, in looking at the language of\n2244 and asking whether the language there, the conclusion\nof direct review defeats the Russello presumption, my\npoint simply is, it does not defeat it. One\ninterpretation is that Congress didn't mean either to\napply here, and instead embraced a rule much like the\nestablished practice under Rule 33, but even if -- the\nCourt does not need to accept that to affirm the court of\nappeals here.\nThe rule logically could be that if the court of\nappeals issues its mandate, the case is over in the court\nof appeals. Nothing else happens, no motion to stay, no\npetition for cert. The case is final. That's -- that's\nconsistent with common understanding of the word.\nQUESTION: But in terms of confusing things, if\nwe were to take that view of it, it would, because\neverybody assumes, well, you file your cert petition, then\nit's on hold until --\nMR. DE BRUIN: No, but -- I'm sorry, but\ncontinuing on my thought, if nothing happens, the case is\nfinal when the court of appeals rules. You have a year.\nIf, however, you petition for cert, then the\njudgment, the finality of the judgment is arrested, and\nthe one year does not begin to run until the petition is\nresolved. That would be perfectly permissible. In other\nwords -- and that is, in fact, the construction of the\nSeventh Circuit, that --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's not quite tolling.\nIf -- if you -- if you waited for, say, 40 days before you\nfiled, does the 40 days count again? Do you tack, or do\nyou get a whole new period?\nMR. DE BRUIN: You would get a whole new period,\nand that is consistent with --\nQUESTION: So -- so that's not quite like\ntolling, I think.\nMR. DE BRUIN: It's not tolling. Now, Congress\nhas provided tolling under 2263. It has provided tolling\nunder different aspects of the statute. But no, this is\nnot tolling. There -- there are established rules that a\njudgment is final, but yet, if you file a motion for\nreconsideration, for instance, the finality of the\njudgment, even though it was final and the time bars were\nrunning, finality is arrested; and then once the petition\nfor reconsideration is decided, you have a full period,\nagain, and so Justice Ginsburg, that would be a perfectly\npermissible construction, and in fact, perhaps the most\nlogical construction, that if you petition for cert, the\nfinality of the judgment is arrested and you have a full\nyear.\nThe point is, finality will always be affected\nby what the defendant does and does not do, and there will\nalways be a series of different rules, depending on\nwhether a petition for cert was filed, whether an appeal\nwas filed, and there will be different rules from State as\nwell as Federal.\nThere's a whole series of different rules; but\nthe rule of the court of appeals in this case was, if\nnothing happens after the court of appeals issues its\ndecision, the judgment is final within the meaning of\n2255. That's consistent with the fact that judgments\nroutinely are final without being dependent upon the\nexpiration of the time for review.\nThe formulation in 2244 is, in fact, unusual.\nCongress provided for that in 2244, but did not provide\nfor that in 2255.\nFor all these reasons, I -- I urge the Court to\nfind that the decision of the court of appeals is correct,\nthe construction of the language affords the text its\nnatural meaning, does not work any harmful results, and\nshould be affirmed.\nThank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. de Bruin, and the\nCourt thanks you for your help to the Court with your\namicus brief in this case.\nMR. DE BRUIN: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I could address first the question of whether or not\nthere is a background understanding of when a judgment of\nconviction becomes final, because conceivably that would\ngive rise to the negative inference that Congress was\ndoing something special in 2244 that it didn't intend in\n2255.\nThe amicus points the Court to the pre-amendment\nRule 33, and I think it's important to play out exactly\nwhat finality means there, because in the pre-amendment\nRule 33, there wasn't agreement on whether or not finality\nattaches upon the issuance of a mandate.\nQUESTION: Which set of Rule 33 are we talking\nabout?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Before the 1998 amendment,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: To what set, what --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize, to criminal\nprocedure.\nQUESTION: Criminal procedure.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do apologize.\nUnder -- before it was amended, some courts said\nit was the judgment.\nThat's discussed in the advisory committee notes to the\namendment.\nIn addition, most things under Rule 33, those\nother than newly discovered evidence, ran from the entry\nof the judgment in the district court, and perhaps most\nimportant of all, it's settled under Rule 33, and this is\nthe Cook case from the Ninth Circuit that's cited in the\namicus brief, that under Rule 33 if a cert petition was\nfiled, that didn't stop the time.\nQUESTION: Well, you say it's settled. It's\nsettled in the Ninth Circuit?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, there were no\ncontrary cases, you're quite right. This Court never\npassed on it, and there's no contrary authority.\nAnd so my point is this. Even under Rule 33, it\ncould mean a lot of different things, and I do think it's\nperfectly clear that among all the analogies, the closest\none is this Court's collateral review precedents.\nI do want to pick up on Justice Breyer's and --\nand the Chief Justice's question about, well, didn't they\nexplicate something in 2244 that they didn't in 2255, and\nif I could give a contrary -- give a hypothetical where I\nthink that reasoning would apply, if 2255 said, when the\njudgment of conviction becomes final by the expiration of\ndirect -- by the conclusion of direct review, it would be\nvery difficult for a 2255 petitioner to say, \"and that\nincludes the time for seeking cert,\" because then you\nwould have a real contrast with 2244. You would have one\nof the phrases in 55, but both in 44, and there you could\nhave a genuine inference.\nHere we don't have anything, and my point is\nthat this silence is not pregnant. You don't draw the\ninference that Congress meant nothing at all, or that\nCongress meant -- as Justice Scalia points out, an even\nnarrower universe.\nThe final point I want to make is about --\nQUESTION: I thought his point was it was an\neven broader universe.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, no, his --\nthe amicus's point would have to be that 2255 means some\nsubset, or some smaller interpretation, or some shorter\ntime.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I thought you were talking\nabout Justice Scalia's --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. You're quite\nright. Justice Scalia's point is that look, if you use\nthe word by, it could either mean it's explicating things,\nor more naturally it means, we've picked a subset, and so\nyou don't have the subset here. That's Russello.\nInterest versus interest in an enterprise. Interest in an\nenterprise is a -- a smaller part of the bigger ball.\nThe final point is about policy reasons.\nThere really is no reason Congress would have intended\nthis period of time, the time when you could have sought\ncert but didn't, to be available to a State prisoner\nversus a -- a Federal prisoner. There's no explanation\ngiven by amicus that makes any sense. For example, GVRs\napply only when a cert petition is filed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
