ZAGRANS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ZAGRANS: Mr. Chief Justice, good morning,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the Court\nrecognized an important limitation on the Court's prior\nsubstantial Federal question cases. The Sixth Circuit\nshould have followed Merrell Dow rather than ignoring it\nin deciding whether the presence of a Federal issue in\nthis Michigan quiet title action properly gave rise to\nFederal question jurisdiction.\nAccording to Merrell Dow, any State law claim\nthat alleges a violation of a Federal statute as an\nelement of the State law cause of action does not state a\nclaim arising under Federal law for section 1331 purposes\nunless --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you take the view that\nMerrell Dow somehow just silently overruled about five\ncases dealing with quiet title actions?\nMR. ZAGRANS: No, Justice O'Connor, we do not\ntake that position. We take Merrell Dow --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That seems to be your\nposition. I mean, I don't think Merrell Dow necessarily\nhad that effect.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Agreed. We believe that Merrell\nDow's decision can be synthesized with the holdings in\nthose cases that Your Honor is referring to by reference\nto the nature of the Federal interest that is at stake and\nthe role that Congress plays.\nIn the Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust\nCompany line of cases and in Hopkins v. Walker, both of\nthose are different sorts of cases from Merrell Dow where\nCongress provided the Federal right that was alleged to\nhave been violated, and the Court held that when Congress\nprovides a Federal statute that is -- is serving as an\nelement of a State law claim, then Congress must have\nintended also to provide a Federal private right of action\nin order for there to be arising-under jurisdiction.\nThat's the distinction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Haven't we -- haven't we got\nsomething equally different here? The -- the issue here,\nas I understand it, is -- is not litigation of the State\nlaw claim, but a claim under Federal law with respect to\nthe passage of title when property is taken for taxes. As\nI understand the -- the original plaintiff's claim, it\nsimply is that if he's right, under Federal law he is\nentitled to a declaration that the property is still his.\nIf he's wrong, the other side is entitled to property.\nBut the issue is a Federal issue, and the only way the\nState has a role in it is that the State provides a\nmechanism, the quiet title action, analogous maybe to\n1983, for getting it into a State court. So it seems to\nme that the issue is a Federal issue, not as in Merrell\nDow, a -- a State cause of action that incorporates by\nreference a Federal standard.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Justice Souter, I agree that it is\na Federal issue. I disagree, with respect, that it's\ndifferent from Merrell Dow because in both that case and\nthis quiet title action under Michigan law, the alleged\nFederal issue is one element that needs to be alleged and\nproved in order to make out the State law claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I don't -- I guess\nthat's where we're parting company. I don't see that\nthere is a State law claim as distinct from a State law\nprocedure for trying that claim in a State court. As I --\nas I said a second ago, it's sort of like 1983. It\ndoesn't create causes of action, but it provides a -- a\njurisdictional basis for getting into court if you've got\na cause of action. And in this case, it's a Federal\ncause.\nMR. ZAGRANS: I see, Your Honor. Under\nMichigan's Compiled Laws and under the rule of procedure\nthat this action was brought under, the plaintiff had to\nallege and prove four things: that he had title, the\nalleged nature of the defendant's title. He had to\ndescribe the property with reasonable particularity, and\nfinally, he had to allege why his title was superior to\nthe defendant's title.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which was a Federal issue.\nMR. ZAGRANS: And that is the only Federal\nissue, just like in Merrell Dow where the Federal -- the\nviolation of the Federal labeling standard was alleged to\nconstitute one element of the product liability claim in\nthat case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as Justice Souter pointed\nout, the State law incorporated the Federal standard and\nmade it its own. Here you have the Federal tax sale and a\nvery strong Federal interest, which was lacking in Merrell\nDow. Justice Stevens said that. But here I think there\ncan be no doubt that the Government has a very strong\ninterest in seeing that tax sales convey a secure title.\nMR. ZAGRANS: No doubt, Justice Ginsburg, but I\nthink it is the wrong emphasis to look to what the State's\ninterest is, which was a -- a part of the focus that the\nSolicitor General's brief was on. For purposes of deciding\nwhether or not Congress intended there to be Federal\nquestion jurisdiction, I don't believe the focus should be\non the State's interest.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my --\nMR. ZAGRANS: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Please, please. I didn't mean\nto interrupt you. Did you finish your answer?\nMR. ZAGRANS: No, but go ahead, Justice Kennedy,\nplease.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, please.\nWell, my -- my initial view of this case was\nmuch like Justice Souter's and -- and I still think that\nthat may be -- may be correct. But I thought your answer\nto Justice Souter would be that there are many cases in\nwhich there is an antecedent Federal title which then goes\ndown through successive purchasers, mining claims, for\ninstance, and those are always under State law. I -- I\nthought that would be your answer to Justice Souter and --\nand also to Justice Ginsburg.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you rely on Merrell Dow,\nwhich is fine. But I thought there was a separate line of\ncases that support you, as well as Merrell Dow.\nMR. ZAGRANS: There are, Your Honor, but I think\nthat to give a -- an honest and principled answer to\nJustice Souter's and Justice Ginsburg's questions, I have\nto face it in line of Merrell Dow and the cases that\nMerrell Dow relied on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We hope all your\nanswers will be principled.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ZAGRANS: Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nhope so too.\nJustice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Justice O'Connor had\nasked you about the -- the quiet title cases, but Kansas\nCity Title & Trust is still good law. It wasn't\noverruled.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree.\nIt is good law.\nAnd I think the distinction that I am asking the\nCourt to draw between that case and Merrell Dow is this.\nBoth cases should be decided under the rubric that\narising-under jurisdiction depends upon whether a Federal\nissue in an otherwise State law case provides a -- a -- an\noutcome-determinative means of resolving the case, and\nthat -- in other words, where the resolution of the case\ndepends upon a substantial question of Federal law.\nBut the difference between Kansas City Title &\nTrust and Merrell Dow is the nature of the Federal\ninterest at stake and the different ways they should be\napplied. In Kansas City Title & Trust, the interest was\n-- or the alleged violation was a Federal constitutional\nviolation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the Court didn't\nmake it -- the Court's proposition in Kansas City Title &\nTrust was if it appears from the complaint that the right\nto relief depends on the construction or application of\nthe Constitution or laws of the United States. So are you\nasking us to take out or laws as dictum, or what is your\nposition?\nMR. ZAGRANS: I believe that the Court in\nMerrell Dow made a limitation on that phrase that Your\nHonor is quoting from, and the limitation is where\nCongress controls the jurisdiction of the Federal courts,\nsuch as with Federal statutory law, then the limitation of\nMerrell Dow that Congress must also have intended to\ncreate a Federal private right of action obtains. I\nbelieve that's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when does -- when does\nthe -- when do the words, or laws, in Kansas City Title &\nTrust have operative effect?\nMR. ZAGRANS: When -- when, as Merrell Dow says,\nCongress intended there to be a Federal private right of\naction for violation of the statute is alleged to be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean that the -- are you\nsaying then in the context of this case that the Federal\nlaw would have to create a quiet title action, which is\ntraditionally State law?\nMR. ZAGRANS: Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly\nwhat we are arguing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But doesn't Congress have to\ncreate causes of action for constitutional violations as\nwell, or at least for most of them?\nMR. ZAGRANS: Your Honor, Congress has not\ncreated a jurisdictional statute for Federal\nconstitutional claims, which is why the Bivens doctrine\narose, unlike section 1983.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe this needs -- I\nmean, if were to clarify --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm not sure that I --\nthat I'm satisfied with the answer. You're -- you're\ntrying to give us one rule for constitutional claims and\nanother rule for statutory claims?\nMR. ZAGRANS: I am, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On -- on what basis? I don't\nunderstand it. Certainly in the text of the\njurisdictional statute, there's no such distinction. What\n-- what is the basis for it?\nMR. ZAGRANS: It derives from footnote 12 of\nMerrell Dow where the Court was attempting to explain this\n-- this difference that we are discussing. And in\nfootnote 12 of Merrell Dow, the Court says that the nature\nof the jurisdictional answer will frequently depend upon\nthe different nature of the Federal interest that is at\nstake. And it distinguished between Smith and -- and\nMoore in that case, Smith being a Federal constitutional\nquestion, Moore being a Federal statutory question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that that\nexplains all of these cases.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Well, Your Honor, yes, I do\nbecause of the nature of Congress' control over whether or\nnot there should be Federal private rights of action. It\nis consistent with the Court's implied private right of\naction jurisprudence from Alexander v. Sandoval, from the\nCentral National Bank of Denver case, et cetera.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can't get anything out\nof the words of the -- of the statute arising under to\nhelp you.\nMR. ZAGRANS: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't\nbelieve you can because as many of the cases that this\nCourt has decided point out, those words are broad. They\nare the exact same language that the constitutional grant\nof Article III jurisdiction uses, and therefore, they have\nto be given content in some other fashion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So just the strength of the\nFederal interest is the --\nMR. ZAGRANS: Clearly the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the controlling test?\nMR. ZAGRANS: -- the strength of the Federal\ninterest is important, Justice Kennedy, but as Merrell Dow\npointed out, the Federal interest is not deemed to be\nsubstantial enough, or the Federal question at stake in\nthe case is not deemed to be sufficiently substantial\nunless Congress has created a Federal private right of\naction for violation of the particular statute that is\nbeing pled.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I -- I wanted to\nfollow up on this because I think it's a confusion that's\nembedded in my mind in some of the cases, exactly what\nJustice Scalia was asking you. And I'd like you to\ncomment on whether the confusion, as I see it, that's\ninvolved here is the words -- arises out of the words,\nprivate right of action. Private right of action is\nwhere, A, one private person sues B, a non-Federal person,\nunder a Federal statute. And the reason that can lead to\nconfusion is because where you have a statute that governs\nthe relation between the Federal Government and a private\nperson, the words private right of action are out of place\nnormally, because an action between the two parties takes\nplace usually under the APA.\nNow, that's what it seems to me is at work here\nbecause the real question is not whether we have a private\nright of action or APA review. The question is whether\nCongress wanted to allow a private person to use this\nparticular Federal provision as the basis for judicial\nreview in a lawsuit. And if that's the right question,\nthe answer here is obviously it did.\nIt happens that we would have titled that\nnormally administrative procedural review under the APA.\nBut whether you call it private right of action or you\ncall it APA review is beside the point. In Merrell Dow,\nCongress did not want actions to come into a court under\nthe statute there at issue. In this case, Congress\ndoesn't mind at all. In fact, it expects actions to come\ninto court under this statute.\nI'd like you to comment on that thought.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Justice Breyer, I disagree with\nthe premise of that thought. Congress in section 7433 did\nprovide what I would like to call a Federal private right\nof action. It's an action by a private party against the\nGovernment, not another private party, for damages in the\nevent the Government violates Federal law in the tax\ncollection process. What Congress did not do -- and the\nSolicitor General concedes it did not do -- is create a\nFederal private right of action for quiet title claims in\ndisputes between two private parties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How did Congress -- surely\nCongress did not expect any pronouncement of -- of title\nby the Federal Government to be immune from challenge by\nprivate individuals. If Congress did not anticipate that\na wrongful assertion of title through the Federal\nGovernment could be challenged by a State action of this\nsort to clear title, how did Congress expect it ever to be\nchallenged? I mean, I can't imagine how else you -- you\nwould attack somebody who -- who claims that he has\nFederal title.\nMR. ZAGRANS: You would bring, Your Honor, a\nState quiet title action, as Grable did in Michigan court,\nand allege, as the basis for the superiority of\nplaintiff's title in that case, the violation of Federal\nstatute by the Federal agents. And therefore, the\npurchaser at this Federal tax sale, Darue Engineering in\nthis case, does not have superior title.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what -- is -- how does\nthat differ from what happened here?\nMR. ZAGRANS: That's exactly what happened here.\nWhat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's exactly what happened\nhere.\nMR. ZAGRANS: What differs, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and is that not\nprecisely what Congress expected? Did not Congress, in\nfact, approve this manner of challenging the asserted\nFederal title?\nMR. ZAGRANS: I think without question, Your\nHonor. What Congress, we are arguing, did not approve is\nthe removal of that State law quiet title action to\nFederal court under arising-under jurisdiction merely\nbecause of the presence of a Federal issue as an element\nof the State law claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think you -- you have\nto acknowledge there are at least three situations then:\nnumber one, where Congress did not create a Federal cause\nof action and did not expect that the States would create\na cause of action to vindicate or challenge the asserted\nFederal interest; number two, where Congress did create a\n-- a Federal cause of action; and number three, falling\nbetween the two where Congress did not create a Federal\ncause of action but, in the nature of things, must have\nanticipated that there would be State causes of action\nresting upon the Federal claim.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Yes, I agree, Your Honor. And in\nMerrell Dow, the Court held that in those middle cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why was that a middle case?\nMR. ZAGRANS: Why was that a middle case?\nBecause in Merrell Dow, the State of Ohio had product\nliability tort law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress would not have\nnecessarily anticipated that the States would glom onto a\nFederal criterion for purposes of their State -- of their\nState tort law --\nMR. ZAGRANS: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whereas here, Congress must\nhave anticipated that quiet title actions of this sort\nwould be brought.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Your Honor, when Congress enacted\nthe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and did not\nprovide a Federal cause of action for it and yet laid out\nFederal standards of conduct for labeling of drugs like\nBendectin in that case, Congress must have understood that\nwithout it creating a Federal private right of action, the\nStates -- the State product liability law, State\ninadequate warning law would subsume claims --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't necessary.\nMR. ZAGRANS: -- for a violation of that Federal\nstandard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- that's the\ndifference. The State in Merrell Dow chose to adopt those\nFederal standards. It was a choice. I don't think a\nState has the prerogative to ignore the effect of a\nFederal tax sale. This is not a matter of State choice,\nand that, it seems to me, is the large difference between\nthe two cases: one, where the State chooses to recognize\nFederal standards when it doesn't have to, and here,\nthere's no question that the Federal law governs the\nsecurity of this title. It's not an option for the State\nto ignore it.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Justice Ginsburg, that's an\nargument that appears in the Solicitor General's brief as\nwell, and I believe that the Solicitor General's focus on\na difference in State interests is misplaced when one is\ndealing with Federal jurisdictional principles. Instead,\nI think the focus should be on the expression of the\nFederal interest, and the best expression of the Federal\ninterest at stake is congressional intent when one is\ndealing with acts of Congress, Federal statutory law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, except the -- except you\nsort of abandon that for constitutional questions for some\ninexplicable reason.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. It's an explicable\nreason to distinguish other earlier cases.\nMR. ZAGRANS: That's exactly right. That's\nexactly right. To -- to try to -- to try to not have to\nargue that, as Justice O'Connor's initial question to me\nsupposed, that all of that prior case law, prior to\nFranchise Tax Board and Merrell Dow, somehow would go out\nthe window sub silentio. And that's not what we are\narguing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- so you are -- you\nare proposing one way to reconcile Kansas City. You say,\nwell, that's the constitutional claim. But why isn't it\nat least as good a reconciliation to say once you go\nthrough -- there's -- there's a Federal claim -- there's a\nFederal question that's dispositive of this case, and you\nagree that that's so here. The whole thing turns on the\nmeaning and effect of that notice provision. So the\nFederal question is what determines this case, and you\nsatisfy the well-pleaded complaint standard.\nThen at that point, when you satisfy the basic\nKansas City Title & Trust provisions, then to see which\nway to swing, why isn't it appropriate to say is this a\ncase where the State has a large interest and the Federal\ninterest is not significant? Or, on the other hand, is it\na case where there is a large Federal interest in seeing\nhow this comes out?\nMR. ZAGRANS: Because, Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthe focus is on the substantiality of the Federal question\nand that's where the difference between the two situations\nyou are positing lies. With constitutional claims, they\nare almost always substantial Federal questions. With\nFederal statutory violations alleged as part of a State\nlaw cause of action, Merrell Dow says they are not\nsubstantial enough to confer arising-under jurisdiction\nunless Congress intended to create a Federal private right\nof action for the violation of that particular statute.\nSo --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that Merrell\nDow did take out those words, or laws, from the Kansas\nCity Title & Trust.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I suppose\nthat would be the effect of how it would have to be read\nBut it's not a question of one Federal interest\nis less than another. Anytime Federal law is involved,\nthe Federal interest is great. The issue is for arising-\nunder purposes, for section 1331 purposes, whether the\nFederal question is substantial or not sufficiently\nsubstantial to confer arising-under jurisdiction. That's\nthe import in our argument and our submission, the holding\nof Merrell Dow.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you would agree that\nwe could leave the -- the Kansas City formulation, the\noral laws, intact and say that the distinguish -- that the\ndistinction between Merrell Dow and this case, which\nleaves it intact is the distinction between in Merrell\nDow's case, the adoption by the State of a Federal\nstandard, though the State did not have to adopt it in its\ntort law, purely optional, and in this case, the\napplication of Federal law which, under the Supremacy\nClause, the State had absolutely no choice but to apply.\nIf we recognize that distinction, we could leave the\nlanguage in Kansas City exactly where it is, couldn't we?\nMR. ZAGRANS: No, Justice Souter, I don't think\nyou could because I think to do that would federalize a\ngreat many State law causes of action that just happen to\nhave, as an element of them, a violation of some Federal\nlaw that, due to the Supremacy Clause, the States would,\nof course, be obliged to enforce.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what are the -- sort of\nthe -- the horribles that you have in mind?\nMR. ZAGRANS: An example would be anytime a tax\npreparer makes a mistake of Federal income tax law in --\nin preparing a return for a client and, as a result of\nthat, the client pays more tax than they otherwise should\nhave and they have a claim against the tax preparer either\nfor common law negligence or professional malpractice\nunder State law, but why did the -- the preparer commit\nmalpractice? Because of an interpretation of Federal tax\nlaw.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but in -- in that case,\nthe action is not enforcing the Federal tax law, whereas\nin this case, the action is, indeed, enforcing the passage\nof title statute under the -- under the tax code.\nMR. ZAGRANS: The tax code, section 6338(b)\nspecifically provides that title passes under State law,\nnot under Federal law. The only issue of Federal law\nhere --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Federal law is\ndeterminative.\nMR. ZAGRANS: The only issue of Federal law here\nthat is determinative is whether or not the agents gave\nproper notice of the seizure.\nAnd interestingly, Justice Ginsburg made\nreference to the well-pleaded complaint rule. There is a\nsecondary issue in this case, and that is that the\ndisputed issue of Federal law was not part of the well-\npleaded complaint. There is no dispute that the IRS\nfailed to give the statutorily required notice of personal\nnotice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that in the -- in the\npleading?\nMR. ZAGRANS: It was, indeed, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that in the complaint?\nMR. ZAGRANS: In the complaint that they failed\nto do it. That is undisputed. The -- the defendant\nconcedes it. The Government concedes it. What was\ndisputed was that there's a different statute --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the well-\npleaded complaint doesn't say it has to be a disputed\nallegation. It says it must be -- you couldn't state the\nclaim without having the Federal law in the complaint.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Agreed, Your Honor. But some of\nthe cases suggest that the issue of Federal law, in order\nto be deemed substantial, must be one that is in good\nfaith disputed. That is to say, undisputed issues of\nFederal law are not substantial enough by themselves to\nconfer Federal question jurisdiction.\nSo I point out that the disputed Federal issue\nfrom a different statute, 6339(b)(2), is in the nature of\na defense that Darue asserted. Notwithstanding the strict\n-- the lack of strict compliance with the notice\nprovision, 6339(b)(2) allows substantial compliance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know you want to reserve\nyour time. Just one quick thing. The Government makes\nthe distinction between an action to remove a cloud on\ntitle and an action for possession. Do you agree that\nthis is a -- a action to remove a cloud on title?\nMR. ZAGRANS: Justice Kennedy, under Michigan\nlaw, as I understand it, there is no distinction any\nlonger. The action to determine title under Michigan\nCompiled Law 600.2932 seems to telescope and subsume both\nof those common law causes of action into one.\nUnless there are further questions from the\nCourt, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nZagrans.\nMr. Walton, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL C. WALTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WALTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case involves only questions of Federal\nlaw. It involves no questions of fact. There are no\ndisputes on any of the facts in this case, and without the\nFederal law, there would be no controversy, there would be\nno claim, there would be no cause of action.\nThe plaintiff's right to relief in the case\nrequires resolution of a substantial question of Federal\nlaw in dispute between the parties in this case, which\nimplicates substantial Federal interests.\nThe attempt to distinguish Merrell Dow --\nMerrell Dow is, in fact, consistent with\nSmith/Gully/Franchise Tax in establishing that test. And\nthe language which the Court utilized in Merrell Dow does\nnot, in any way, abandon those cases or indicate that the\nlogic is inappropriate. The Merrell Dow place in the\nevaluation -- in the -- in the kaleidoscopic situations\nwhich were described by Justice Cardoza is in a situation\nwhere a Federal standard has been incorporated into the\nState law cause of action. That's its place here. It\nwas, I believe, by this Court an attempt to -- to\nilluminate what would occur in that circumstance, and it\nis limited to that circumstance.\nAnd the -- the question, which is set forth at\nthe beginning in Merrell Dow, about the incorporation --\nand I'm -- I'm at page 805. The question presented is\nwhether the incorporation of a Federal standard in a State\nlaw cause of action, when Congress intended there be no\nFederal private action for violations of that Federal\nstandard, makes one arising under the Constitution, laws,\nor treaties of the United States, all three.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that the plaintiff\nhere alleged that the tax deed were forged, that the\noccupant simply forged the tax deed and was occupied under\nforgery. State cause of action there?\nMR. WALTON: I believe that that would be a\nState cause of action, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Then suppose he\nalleged not that it was forged, but that this -- that the\noccupier of the land had -- had misconstrued the\noccupier's rights to bid at the tax sale or -- or that\nthere -- the tax sale should never have been held. Then\nthat's a Federal --\nMR. WALTON: Then I -- excuse me, Your Honor.\nThen I believe that would be Federal, yes. That would\nrequire resolution -- that would require construction of\nthe Federal statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if it doesn't require\nconstruction, but -- but what if there is a factual\ncontroversy? Suppose there is a factual controversy as to\nwhether notice was given and notice is required under the\nFederal statute. Does -- does that factual controversy\nwith regard to an essential element of -- of Federal law\nmake it a Federal case?\nMR. WALTON: If it's -- excuse me, Your Honor.\nIf it still presents a question of Federal law, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't present any\nquestion of law, just a question of fact. Let's say both\nparties agree about the law, but the fact that is\ndeterminative of nothing, except the operation of Federal\nlaw, is at issue. Now, that -- that would normally --\nunder 1331, you'd be able to come into Federal court I\nsuppose just where your only dispute is a factual dispute,\nbut it is a factual dispute regarding the operation of\nFederal law. What -- what if this were just a factual\ndispute about the operation of Federal law? What would we\ndo with it? Does the fact that it's a factual dispute\nmake it not substantial, not a substantial Federal\nquestion?\nMR. WALTON: I think that it could still be a\nsubstantial Federal question because it could implicate a\nsubstantial Federal interest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're taking the -- I\nmean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and how is that\ndifferent from the forgery?\nMR. WALTON: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How -- how is that different\nfrom the forgery hypothetical?\nMR. WALTON: It would -- it would then be the\nsame, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're taking the\nposition then, as I understand it -- and I -- I don't\ndisagree with your -- your position necessarily -- that\nits construction or application --\nMR. WALTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- of Federal law.\nMR. WALTON: Yes, Your Honor. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the -- there was an\nissue in this case about the plaintiff in the quiet title\naction having waited too long. I think here it was 6\nyears after. So -- so suppose there was a defense of\nlaches under State law. That could be an issue in an\naction in this format, quiet title action, which would be\ngoverned by State law. Isn't that so?\nMR. WALTON: It would, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that case wouldn't be\nremovable then if the -- if the defense is laches? The\nplaintiff --\nMR. WALTON: I believe -- excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes?\nMR. WALTON: I believe that it could be\nremovable because it could still involve the application\nof the Federal law --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you might never get to\nthe Federal law if the determination of 6 years is too\nlong to wait to bring a suit like this. Then you would\nremove and you could have an outcome based solely on State\nlaw in the Federal court. You'd have a State claim. The\nissue that divides the parties is how long was too long,\nand the court decides the case on that basis and never\ngets to the Federal question.\nMR. WALTON: I see, Your Honor, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if laches is pleaded as a\ndefense, then it's not removable? But don't you --\nwell --\nMR. WALTON: Your Honor, I'm not certain.\nThat's -- I'm sorry. I'm not certain. I believe that it\ncould be removable, still utilizing the application of the\nFederal law to that circumstance, even in the factual\ndispute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, at what point do you\nremove the case?\nMR. WALTON: I'm sorry. I don't understand the\nquestion, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A complaint is filed in State\ncourt, and you are the defendant and you want to remove\nthat case to Federal court.\nMR. WALTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How much time do you have to\nremove? Would it be in advance of your answer?\nMR. WALTON: Yes, Your Honor, it would.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that in my case, you would\nremove on the basis of the complaint before you put in\nyour answer, and I think you're --\nMR. WALTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then you could get into\nthe Federal court, and the answer could be laches and\nyou're in the Federal court and the only question that's\ndecided is the State law question.\nMR. WALTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that happens pretty\noften in removal -- in -- in removed cases. You really\ndon't know what the defense is going to be. If it's\nremoved on the basis of the well-pleaded complaint, when\nthe defense gets there, it -- it may often be a State -- a\nState defense. Right?\nMR. WALTON: That's accurate, Your Honor.\nExcuse me.\nIf there are no additional questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Walton.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn action arises under Federal law not only when\nFederal law supplies the cause of action, but also when\nthe plaintiff's right to relief under a well-pleaded State\nlaw cause of action necessarily depends on a substantial\nquestion of Federal law. That second category of arising-\nunder jurisdiction is -- applies here because petitioner's\nright to relief under its State law quiet title action\nnecessarily depends on the allegation in its well-pleaded\ncomplaint that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why wouldn't that same rule\napply in a State where there's a common law cause of\naction for ejectment and it's substantively under State\nlaw different from a cloud on the title? You discuss in\nyour brief, very helpfully I think, the -- the Hopkins and\nthe Taylor line of cases.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How is your statement that you\njust made consistent with the Court's holding under the\nTaylor line of cases?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In the Taylor line of cases,\nwhat is necessary to -- to allege in a well-pleaded\ncomplaint for common law ejectment is only that I have\ntitle and you're wrongfully here. You do not have to\nplead the facts that show superiority of title.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if we had exactly the facts\nof this case and there's a common law ejectment, you would\nnot say that it goes to Federal court. It would stay in\nState court.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. On Taylor v. Anderson you\nare not. But the difference, Justice Kennedy, is in that\nkind of case, the plaintiff wouldn't be eliminating the\ncloud on his title. He would just be getting possession\nof the property. So there's always going to be an\nincentive for the plaintiff who's faced with a document, a\ndeed, that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose that --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- to -- to sue for cloud on\ntitle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in a common law ejectment\naction that we are supposing that what's going to come up\nis the tax sale.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is just the facts of\nthis case. And I suppose that if the plaintiff prevails\non the common law cause of action for ejectment, he's got\na -- a res judicata defense if the -- if the present\noccupier then makes another suit based on the tax deed.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In the common law cause of\naction, which isn't available in Michigan, but under the\ncommon law cause of action, all was -- all that was\ndetermined was that you had a right to possession at the\ntime the lawsuit was filed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess this -- this problem is\nsimply a consequence of the well-pleaded complaint rule.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- it is, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If we -- we altered that rule,\nit would make more sense.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, the -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this kind of\npeculiarity happens all the time.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on whether the\nFederal question has to be pleaded or not.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. And the\njustification for the well-pleaded complaint rule that the\nCourt has authored is that it provides a quick rule of\nthumb for determining at the outset of the litigation\nwhich cases are most likely to be ones where the Federal\nlaw issues are at the forefront.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's quick and dirty. We\nhaven't tried to slice the baloney too thin in this area,\nhave we? We -- we --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's enough to be pretty close.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the way you stated the\nrule, if I heard you correctly, you're contending that\nMerrell Dow was incorrectly decided.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, because Merrell Dow did not\ninvolve a substantial question of Federal law, and that\nwas part of the test that I announced.\nAnd the difference between this case and Merrell\nDow is twofold. First, this case falls within the Hopkins\nline of cases, and second, this -- the role of Federal law\nin Merrell Dow is completely different than it was in this\ncase and in the Hopkins line of cases. What was going on\nin Merrell Dow is that the State adopted a Federal\nstandard as presumptive evidence of State law negligence,\nand when a State adopts a Federal standard into its own\nState law standard, the -- the action remains one that is\nfundamentally State law in character. So the Federal\nquestion in the case is not regarded as substantial.\nBut here, the situation is entirely different.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We do occasionally\nreview that kind of a decision here.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: You do, Mr. Chief Justice. And\nthe Court in Merrell Dow drew a distinction between what\nis substantial enough of a Federal question to trigger\narising-under jurisdiction as an original matter and what\nis substantial enough of a Federal question to obtain this\nCourt's review. And we're dealing here just with the kind\nof substantiality that's necessary for original\njurisdiction under 1331.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that a fact in a\nparticular case which affects nobody else in the country,\nbut which is determinative of the Federal question is\nnever a substantial question of Federal law. Is it? So\nyou -- you would not agree that -- that it's not only the\n-- the content, but also the application of Federal law\nthat's --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Let me draw a distinction\nbetween those cases where the cause of action is supplied\nby Federal law, in which case factual issues are resolved\nby Federal courts as long as there's a Federal cause of\naction and cases where there's not a Federal cause of\naction. Then you need -- the right to relief has to\ndepend on a substantial question of Federal law. So if\nthe only issue in the case, in that kind of case, is a\nfactual dispute and everybody agrees on the law, then\nthere's no substantial Federal question, no removal\njurisdiction. But if the right to relief depends on\nFederal law and the meaning of Federal law and there's\nalso a factual issue in the case, that would be removable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: If there were only a\ndispute about when the notice was given and not a factual\ndispute, then it would not have been removable I take it.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It's -- it's removable if the\nonly question was whether notice was given. But if the\nquestion is was sufficient notice given such as to\ntransfer title under Federal law, then that's removable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, that's a very --\nsliced baloney very thin.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that\nslices the baloney the way this Court's cases have sliced\nthe baloney, and that -- the rule is that there has to be\na substantial question of Federal law. There is one when\nthe action depends on the meaning of Federal law, but not\none where everybody agrees on the meaning of Federal law\nand all that's at issue is a dispute about the facts.\nNow, this case, as I said, does fall within the\nHopkins line of cases, and in each of those cases, the\nCourt held there was arising-under jurisdiction in a quiet\ntitle action where the plaintiff's claim that it had\nsuperior title to the land in question depended on the\nmeaning of Federal law. And, of course, that's true here.\nThe quiet title action provides the mechanism for review\nof this question, but the question is entirely one of\nFederal law as to who has the superior interest in the\nland, the tax sale purchaser or the taxpayer.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nGornstein.\nMr. Zagrans, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC H. ZAGRANS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ZAGRANS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWe agree with General Gornstein's statement of\nthe test. The test is a State cause of action that\nnecessarily depends on a substantial question of Federal\nlaw arises under for 1331 purposes.\nThe difference between my argument and the\nargument of respondent is the meaning of substantial or\nwhat constitutes substantiality. And in Merrell Dow, the\nCourt held for all Federal statutory purposes the Federal\nlaw is not substantial enough to confer arising-under\njurisdiction unless Congress created a private remedy\nalong with the statute. That's where we part company.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Zagrans, there is\nlanguage in Merrell Dow that makes it sound like it's not\nas clear and certain as you are urging. I think that the\nopinion author said that 1331's domain is shaped by the\ndemands of reason and coherence, dictates of sound\njudicial policy, and common sense. And if you just take\nthat last question when the only question is, is mail\nnotice good enough to satisfy the Federal statute, or do\nyou have to have in-hand service? Doesn't common sense\nsay what that section means should be a Federal question,\nappropriate for a Federal court to decide?\nMR. ZAGRANS: I agree, Justice Ginsburg, is --\nit is a Federal question as a common sense matter and\nevery other way. It does not follow that it should be\ndecided and adjudicated by a Federal court. State courts\ncan and do --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm simply making the point\nthat you are reading Merrill Lynch -- Merrell Dow in a\nrather rigid way. And yet, there is this language in it\nthat says in -- in -- what was before the Court in Merrell\nDow made perfectly good sense in that tort action to have\nit going on in State court. This is quite a different\npicture.\nMR. ZAGRANS: I think, Your Honor, that Merrell\nDow's emphasis on making pragmatic, sensitive judgments,\njudgments that are both principled and common sense,\ndictated the holding in that case which was when it's an\nact of Congress that is being inserted as an element of a\nState law claim, in order then to bootstrap that State law\nclaim into Federal court on removal jurisdiction, there\nwould need to be a substantial Federal question. Who\ndecides that? Congress decides that, both as a matter of\njudicial power and as a matter of common sense\napplication.\nAnd that's the distinction, by the way, with the\nHopkins line of cases. I don't believe that the Hopkins\nline is any different from the Smith v. Kansas City Title\n& Trust line in terms of this emphasis on necessarily\ndepending on a substantial question of Federal law. The\ndifference in Hopkins is that those were competing Federal\nland claims. The only thing in the case was Federal law.\nBoth sides took their entitlement to the property from\nFederal mining law, and the Federal issues in that case\neither were exclusive of all the legal issues or so\noverwhelmingly predominated over the State law issues,\nthat that was the result in those cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was no\nState law issue in this case, that the whole thing turned\non what kind of notion -- notice was sufficient to convey\ntitle.\nMR. ZAGRANS: There are many State law issues in\nthis case, Your Honor, in terms of the State quiet title\naction. The only disputed issue and the issue that the\nrespondent says the State law claim necessarily depends\nfor its resolution is this disputed issue of Federal law\nover the notice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nZagrans.\nMR. ZAGRANS: Thank you.\n"
