SIMS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SIMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Second Circuit's decision vacating for\nlack of jurisdiction a settlement agreement that\ncompensated authors for all their arguably infringed\nworks in the face of Congress's direction that Federal\ndistrict courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil\naction arising under copyright is wrong for three\nreasons. First, even -- first, the decision is\nincorrect under the unanimous holding three years ago in\nArbaugh that where Congress affords unqualified subject\nmatter jurisdiction, other statutory provisions argued\nto be jurisdictional that do not clearly restrict that\njurisdiction won't be deemed to do so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a lot harder\ncase than Arbaugh, though. Arbaugh involved the\ndefinition of an employer and then the scope of the\nstatute. This one says no suit shall be instituted.\nMR. SIMS: Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on\nthe Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory\nthreshold condition much like the one here. You\ncouldn't bring a Title VII action unless you filed a\nparticular kind of piece of paper with the EEOC. And\nZipes and Arbaugh both held that those statutory\nconditions or essential ingredients were not\njurisdictional, and the Court relied, heavily I think,\non the fact that jurisdiction was separately provided\nfor and the provisions at issue weren't.\nThe second point I want to make is that,\neven putting the clear statement rule of Arbaugh to one\nside, statutory text, structure, purpose and history all\npoint to classifying 411(a) as mandatory but not\njurisdictional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you are\nright that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement\nrule, but I think that's significant only going forward.\nI don't know that Congress, when it passed this\nprovision, could have been aware of the clear statement\nrule that Arbaugh articulated.\nMR. SIMS: Well, the Court did apply --\nreiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell\ncase with respect to a provision that had predated\nArbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that.\nBut in any event, our second point is that\nif you look at the traditional indicia of not only text\nbut also structure, history and purpose, this provision\nshould be ranked as mandatory but not jurisdictional.\nAnd the third point I want to get to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with the --\nwith the government that it's mandatory for the district\ncourt but prohibited to the court of appeals? The\ngovernment has this hybrid where, because of the public\npurposes served by registration, not only can but the\ndistrict court should raise the failure to register on\nits own, but then the government says once you have a\nfinal judgment in district court, it's no longer open\nfor the court of appeals to raise it on its own.\nDo you agree with that or do you say it's\nfor the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it,\ntoo bad?\nMR. SIMS: Justice Ginsburg, we certainly\nagree with the government with respect to the court of\nappeals. With respect to the district court, on the one\nhand, my clients don't -- are satisfied with the\ngovernment's position. On the other hand, as Justice\nScalia's decision, I think, in Day v. McDonough pointed\nout, the traditional default rule really is that\ndefenses are up to defendants to raise.\nIn this particular kind of situation where\nthere is no reason at all, I think, to suspect that\ndefense counsel will not raise 411 whenever -- none of\nthe cases that Ms. Merritt raises for example, involve\nsituations of waiver, where the issues weren't raised\nuntil the court of appeals -- I think that the Court can\nrely, frankly, on defendants and on the ability of\ndistrict judges to nudge defense counsel when they need\nnudging.\nBut if the Court felt that the provision was\nimportant enough so that it wanted to impose on district\ncourts the obligation of strict policing, I think it\ncould. But as I say, I have been practicing copyright\nlaw for 25 years; I've never seen a defendant who either\nmissed a defense or chose not to raise it.\nThe third point I want to raise if there is\ntime is simply that, even if 411(a) were deemed\njurisdictional at the outset of the case with respect to\nits language which talks about instituting, nothing in\neither its text or purpose suggests that Congress meant\nto deprive district courts of their usual power to\nsettle cases with respect to approving settlement\nagreements.\nIn this case, because the plaintiffs\ncomplied with 411(a) at the front door by alleging\nproperly that they had complied with the obligation, we\nthink the district court had jurisdiction to send the\nparties to mediation and then necessarily to approve the\nagreement they returned with three years later. Now\nwith respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can I ask you, one\nof the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it\ncorrectly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in\nphrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party\nwho had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after\ndismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication\nis that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there\nwould be a merits dismissal because of the failure to\nhave gone to the Copyright Office first. And therefore\nwould not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come\nback to the court.\nMR. SIMS: I don't understand the amicus to\nbe making that argument. If Your Honor is referring\nto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --\nMR. SIMS: -- the third -- the third\nsentence of 411(a), I think that's the principal\nargument she makes as to why this satisfies Arbaugh and\nwe think, quite to the contrary, the third sentence of\n411(a) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I didn't -- I didn't\nthink it related to the third sentence. I -- I thought\nshe said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure\nthat you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go\nto the Copyright Office initially would not result in a\nmerits dismissal so that you could not later go back and\nthen rebring the suit. If it was jurisdictional, just a\njurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be\ncured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit\ncould then proceed.\nMR. SIMS: Your Honor, I think that the --\nbecause of the way 411(a) is phrased, dismissals under\n411(a), whether we are correct that it's not\njurisdictional or whether they are correct that it is, I\nthink ordinarily --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would be --\nMR. SIMS: -- without prejudice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You'd be able to come back\nanyway?\nMR. SIMS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought.\nMR. SIMS: That's the nature of this\nrequirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought you'd\nsay.\nMR. SIMS: Yeah.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMR. SIMS: With respect to the Arbaugh --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- if the statute of\nlimitations had run, could you still come back?\nMR. SIMS: The problem in this case, and\nreally the reason why the settlement agreement has\nturned out the way it did is there is no effective --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, not -- not\nnecessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical\ncase.\nMR. SIMS: There is no effective statute of\nlimitations in these cases, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I said in a typical case.\nMR. SIMS: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or is it just --\nMR. SIMS: In -- in a case where the\ninfringement is the existence of something on the web,\nthen there is no statute of limitations effectively,\nbecause the argument would be that the making available\nis an infringement.\nWe don't think that the last sentence of\n411(a) satisfies Arbaugh or indeed is -- is any evidence\ntoward this being jurisdictional. The last sentence was\ninserted, as the history makes perfectly clear, to solve\nthe problem created by the Vacheron decision that the\nSecond Circuit had decided in 1958. And in that case,\nwhat justice -- Judge Hand had done, and other courts\nhave done it, too, is to say it is -- district courts\ncannot review the registrar's action in denying\nregistration, and that has to be done in a separate\nmandamus action, at that point in Washington, D.C.\nSo the lesson simply is Congress's way of\nsaying very clearly: We want to get rid of that\nrigamarole and we want to allow all this to be done\nefficiently. But the statement that this could be done\neven if the registrant didn't show up is not at all any\nstatement, much less a clear statement, that this was\nintended to be jurisdictional. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sims, it has been\npointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions.\nThat is, back in the district court before there was a\nsettlement, you urged before the district court that\n411(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded\ncertifying a class that included the non-registered\ncopyright holders. You did make that argument in the\ndistrict court, and now you are saying -- you are\nconfessing error, that was wrong?\nMR. SIMS: Your Honor, I don't think it's\nfair to say that we made that argument. We did -- we\ndid issue, we did say that sentence in one or two\nplaces, and the argument --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The argument --\nMR. SIMS: But I think it's -- I think it's\ndifferent, because the issue in the district court was\nthe fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the\nsettlement and there was an attack on the different\nvaluation for unregistered claims. In that context we\nrelied on 411(a). The argument would have been exactly\nthe same had we said, as we should have, that 411(a) is\nmandatory but not jurisdictional. We were guilty of\nexactly the loose language that this Court was guilty of\nin Robinson and Smith, as it pointed out in Eberhart or\nKontrick.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and --\nMR. SIMS: But as -- but as the Court\ndecision in that case said, there was no need to\noverrule Robinson or Smith because really what was going\non there was the Court had been saying the rule was\nmandatory, and the additional language that was\njurisdictional was loose language.\nOur argument never focused on the ranking of\n411(a). It was always rooted in the existence of the\nrule which did justify, and on the merits of the appeal\nback in the Second Circuit we will again argue did\njustify, a different valuation of the claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you shouldn't use\nloose language, especially when it's the same loose\nlanguage, supposedly, that seems to have been used by\nall the courts of appeals and all the district courts.\nMR. SIMS: Not all the courts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For years and years.\nMR. SIMS: Your Honor, the first court of\nappeals which said that 411(a) said -- not held -- was\njurisdictional was in 1990. That's well after the 1976\nact, and the original act had been -- I mean, the 1909\nact, which it was patterned after, had been nearly\n100 years earlier. There was no court of appeals that\never said that the 1909 act was jurisdictional, and when\nthis Court had that case in the Washingtonian case in\nthe 1930s, there was no reference to it being\njurisdictional by either the majority or the dissent.\nAnd I think Washingtonian is particularly interesting\nbecause there the district court had originally held\nthat it was jurisdictional and then sua sponte recanted\na few days later and issued another position. And that\nis in the record of this Court in Washingtonian and it\nwas pointed out by Professor Ben Kaplan in the report to\nthe register and to Congress in connection with the 1976\nact.\nSo the issue was raised for people to think\nabout if anybody had. But Congress did not in 1976 or\nat any time earlier say that this was intended to be\njurisdictional or was jurisdictional. So if -- if\npassing the Arbaugh argument with respect to text,\nstructure, history and purpose -- the structure I think\nis particularly telling, because in this case the\nprovision of jurisdiction is in Title 28, the provision\nof registration is in the Copyright Act. They've been\nseparated --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But still it's a statute\nand didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory\nqualification on the right to sue is generally\njurisdictional?\nMR. SIMS: I don't think the Court said\nthat. I think that the Court said that in Bowles with\nrespect to time limits for appeal. I think Bowles is\nquite clearly limited to time limits for appeal, and the\nCourt's decision rested on -- heavily on stare decisis.\nWith respect to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought they made a\ndistinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I\nforgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the\nground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress\nmakes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.\nMR. SIMS: But this doesn't involve a time\nlimit. This involves, as Arbaugh and Zipes did,\ningredients of the claim, preconditions to the claim,\nthreshold steps with respect to the claim, and I think\nthere is no reason for the Arbaugh approach not to\napply. But in any event the structure is telling here;\nthe language is telling as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you are\ntalking about the language, what about John R. Sand &\nGravel? That said we held it was jurisdictional when\nthe statute said: \"Suits shall be barred.\" The\nlanguage here is \"No suit shall be instituted.\" That\nsounds pretty close.\nMR. SIMS: I think not, Chief Justice\nRoberts. The language here has been used in copyright\nstatutes in 1831, as our reply brief points out, and\nincludes the language for statutes of limitation and for\ncopyright notice. And all of those have always been\ndeemed mandatory. None of them has been deemed\njurisdictional.\nAgain, Section 507 of the Copyright Act, the\nstatute of limitations provision here, has almost\nexactly the same language as in 411. John R. Sand I\nthink the Court treated as in Bowles --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that was -- that\nwas a statute of limitations provision, right? It shall\nbe barred after six years?\nMR. SIMS: Well, John R. Sand involved a\nspecial situation of suits against the government and\nconsiderations of sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Court said\nit was mandatory. I don't remember when they used the\nword \"jurisdictional.\"\nMR. SIMS: Well, I think John R. Sand held\nthat provision was jurisdictional, but I think the\ndecision went off on -- on stare decisis, and the fact\nthat the Court had, with respect to the Tucker Act and\nmatters of suits against the government, taken a\ndifferent position.\nThose, I think, are really the only\ncarve-outs, the statutory time limits for appeal and\nsuits against the government, from the general Arbaugh\nrule.\nSo here Congress has used this language\nrepeatedly. This Court's own forms for copyright\ninfringement, which were first promulgated in the 1930s,\nhave patterned our argument and are contrary to the\namicuses'. They have always treated the registration\nprovision of the model complaint differently from the\njurisdictional provisions. Those are in separate\nsections, not next to each other even.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have forms for\ncopyright infringement actions?\nMR. SIMS: You do. The Federal Rule --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Live and learn.\nMR. SIMS: And because they haven't changed\nvery much in 70 years, you probably haven't spent much\ntime with them.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It'S Form 19.\nMR. SIMS: Yes. It was originally Form 17.\nWe have gone through the history. But I think there is\nreally only one change and in every respect it is\nidentical to what it was in 1938. And, again, as I say,\nit separates out the registration provision from the\njurisdictional provision.\nIf Congress had wanted to make registration\njurisdictional, it would have been extraordinarily easy\nto do so. All they would have had to add at the\nbeginning of 411(a) is \"notwithstanding anything in 1338\nand 1331.\"\nWe have -- we have included in our brief as\nan appendix about 60-odd Federal statutes, which carved\nout jurisdiction otherwise provided by 1331 or other\nprovisions, and 411(a) looks nothing like them. They\nall look, roughly, like each other.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask a sort of basic\nquestion I never understood about this case. As I\nunderstand it, the end-of-the-line concern of the\nfairness of the settlement, and particularly to people\nwho have copyrights who have never been registered. Am\nI right, that that's what --\nMR. SIMS: Well, not -- not quite. There\nwere -- there were ten authors who objected, I mean, as\na group, and they wanted more money for unregistered\nauthors. There were, needless to say, tens of thousands\nof other authors who didn't object, but it is true that\nthe objectors wanted -- thought that they had gotten a\nbad deal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those were people who\nowned some registered copyrights, but had other works\nthat were not -- had no registered copyrights. Is that\nright?\nMR. SIMS: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Were there any of those\npeople who had no -- no copyrights at all?\nMR. SIMS: Well, they -- I don't know, Your\nHonor, whether the objectors had any registered works.\nI know that the named plaintiffs had more unregistered\nworks than registered works.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they had some\nregistered works?\nMR. SIMS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You see, one of the -- one\nof the risks involved here is whether people who had no\nregistered works are being adequately protected by this\nClass C settlement.\nMR. SIMS: Yes. This is not a situation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And just to get the\nquestion on the table -- I don't want to take up much of\nyour time. I don't understand how it makes any\ndifference whether you say the rule is mandatory or the\nrule is jurisdictional, in terms of the fairness of the\nsettlement, at the end of the line.\nMR. SIMS: I don't think that has anything\nto do with the fairness of the settlement. I think we\nare here because the Second Circuit blew up the\nsettlement and said we can't settle this case, and the\nonly way it was settleable was to give the publishers\nand the databases complete peace by clearing all off of\nthis off.\nAnd so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that,\ncertainly, would be open. If you are correct that the\nSecond Circuit shouldn't have cut this off at the\nthreshold by saying it's jurisdictional, the question of\nthe fairness of the settlement is what you were\ncontending.\nMR. SIMS: That is correct, Your Honor.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime. But the -- the adequacy and fairness of the\nsettlement is back in the Second Circuit on remand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Anders.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER ANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nStatutory prerequisites to suit like Section\n411(a) often fall into one of two distinct categories.\nThey are either jurisdictional and therefore unwaivable\nor they are not jurisdictional and are fully waivable.\nSection 411(a)'s registration requirement falls in the\nmiddle of those two extremes.\nIt is not jurisdictional, but it should not\nbe fully waivable. The provision does not speak to the\npower of the courts to decide cases and therefore it\ndoes not limit the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate\ninfringement suits.\nBut, because of this phrase and mandatory\nlanguage, the requirement should be strictly enforced\nwhenever the defendant asserts it, and because the\nrequirement serves important public interest that are\nindependent of the concerns of the parties to any\nindividual suit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is that\nthe district court really should have dismissed this\ncase at the outset?\nMS. ANDERS: I think that, in the ordinary\ncase, the district court should -- when -- when the\ndefendant waives the requirement, which would be the\nrare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it. When\nthe defendant waives the requirement, the district court\nshould consider whether accepting that waiver would\nundermine the public interest behind 411.\nNow, in this particular case, it may not\nhave been an abuse of discretion for the district court\nto consider those interests and decide that here it\nwould have been acceptable to accept the defendant's\nwaiver and permit the resolution to go forward because,\nin this case, the periodicals that -- that are\ninvolved -- the works at issue were primarily already in\nthe possession of the Library of Congress, because they\nhad been registered as -- the periodicals themselves had\nbeen registered.\nSo the Library's interest is not as strongly\nimplicated here. In addition, this is a case in which\nthere was going to be settlement, so the Court wasn't\ngoing to need to adjudicate the copyright claims and\ntherefore the opportunity for the register's views to be\ntaken into account was less important.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe this is the same\nquestion. Are you representing the interest of the\nLibrary of Congress?\nMS. ANDERS: Yes, we are representing the\ninterest of the Library of Congress.\nSo I think in this case it may have been\nappropriate for the district court to conclude that --\nthat it could let someone go forward, notwithstanding\nthe fact that some unregistered copyrights were\ninvolved.\nBut after adjudication on the merits, the\ndefendant has waived the requirement, and, having come\nup, Section 411(a), like any other non-jurisdictional\nrule, should be subject to the general principle that\nissues that are not raised below should not be\nconsidered for the first time on appeal, absent\nextraordinary circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You were candid to say\nthat this is in a hybrid category, that the government\nwas taking an intermediate position. Do you know of any\nother provision where the district court has an\nobligation to raise the question on its own motion that\nis yet not jurisdictional?\nMS. ANDERS: I believe this Court has\nrecognized that waiver doctrines in general are\ndiscretionary, and so, particularly in the area of res\njudicata, the Court has recognized in the Plaut v.\nSpendthrift Farm and Arizona v. California that the\nCourt has some discretion to enforce res judicata on its\nown motion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Very, very limited. I\nthink Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a\npreclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.\nMS. ANDERS: That's correct. I think also\nthe plain error rule presupposes that there are some\nerrors that the district court has a responsibility to\ncorrect on its own, even though neither party has\nbrought the error to its attention. So in other words,\nthe district court has the obligation to issue a legal\nruling that neither party has asked for, and I think\nthat kind of regime is appropriate here because the\npublic interest at issue, the Library's interest and the\ninterest in the public record of copyright, those don't\ndepend on the defendant's litigation decisions -- they\nshouldn't depend on the defendant's particular strategic\ndecisions within a particular case.\nThe Library's interest will always be in\nhaving every work registered and the public interest and\npublic record will be the same.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your discussion\nof that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg\nand in your brief, do you think that that's within the\nquestion presented, rephrased?\nMS. ANDERS: I think it is fairly within the\nquestion of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I\nthink, is -- also encompasses the question of how the\nrule should be enforced, assuming that it is\nnon-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case.\nSo I do think that the -- the\ncharacterization of this rule as a mandatory or a\nwaivable rule is -- is within the question presented.\nSo I think that the regime we're proposing best gives\neffect to the mandatory, but non-jurisdictional language\nthat Congress used in Section 411(a).\nAnd it also protects the public interest\nthat the requirement serves, which, again, the\ncompilation of a public record of copyrighted works in\nthe copyright office, which allows a robust licensing\nsystem under the Copyright Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But how -- how would we get\nto hold what -- what you say is the law? It seems, to\nme, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we\nagree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this\ncase -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the\ndistrict court.\nThat's the end of the case, and so why do we\nhave to engage in the further discussion, well,\nordinarily, the district court must raise it on its\nown and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily --\nyou know, the appellate court should.\nWhy do we have to get into that?\nMS. ANDERS: I don't think you have to get\ninto it, Justice Scalia. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which means we shouldn't.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ANDERS: Well, that may be the case, but\nI think we are simply trying to -- trying to explain to\nthe Court what we think how the rule should be applied\nin the district court, in the -- in the ordinary case,\nand then, in the rare case, this one, where the\ndefendant has waived, and permitting the settlement to\ngo forward, it wouldn't adversely affect the public\ninterest that are normally in force here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have an\nexample of the non-ordinary case? I mean, you seem to\nsay, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment\nthat it shouldn't be implemented, I guess. But when\nwouldn't it be after judgment?\nMS. ANDERS: I think that the -- that in\ngeneral, the requirement would be considered waived if\nit's not raised before judgment. We can't think of a\ncase in which the extraordinary circumstance would be\nfulfilled.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's more -- so\nit's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?\nMS. ANDERS: No, I'm sorry. What I meant to\nsay was that I don't think this rule could ever be\nenforced, in the first instance, on appeal if it has\nbeen waived below. I think the general civil rule for\nnon-jurisdictional requirements is that if it's not\nraised before judgment, it's lost on appeal --\ncircumstances --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's normal, but\nnot invariable.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think that's the\nrule -- that's the rule that this Court has applied to\nconstitutional rights with the plain error rule, and\nalso, with respect to structural constitutional rights\nthat might implicate other public interests, the general\nrule is that if the requirement has not been raised\nduring the -- during the trial stages of the case, then\nit can't be enforced for the first time on appeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless it is plain error.\nMS. ANDERS: Unless it's plain error, and in\nthis situation, if the plain error standard applied, or\nsomething even more -- even more heightened in the civil\ncontext, we can't think of a case in which registration\nrequirements --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty plain that the\nthings haven't been registered. I mean, right? And\nit's pretty plain that if they hadn't been registered,\nthe district court should not have proceeded with the\ncase. So I don't know why it wouldn't normally be plain\nerror in -- in the court of appeals.\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think those -- those\ncircumstances would be true in most cases in which the\n-- for some reason, the requirement hadn't been reached\nat the trial stage. So I don't think that the\nextraordinary circumstance is present here that would\njustify overturning the independent interest in judgment\nthat our legal system has, the finality of judgment, the\nrights of the parties in relying on that judgment and\nthe judicial resources expended.\nYou know, I think in some ways we can think\nof this requirement as sort of like a filing fee, that\nit's -- it serves interests beyond those of the parties\nat the district court, and therefore you wouldn't think\nof it as waivable at the instance of the defendant. But\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There really are, in\nour recent decisions, it seems to me, two different\nlines of authority. There is the Bowles and the John R.\nSand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as\njurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't. And\nit does seem to me that the language here, \"No suit\nshall be instituted,\" sounds an awful lot like \"suit\nshall be barred,\" or the other language in -- in Bowles.\nMS. ANDERS: I think it's similar to a lot\nof language that's used in statutes of limitations,\nwhich are traditionally considered non-jurisdictional,\nthat no statute -- no suit shall be instituted.\nI think what's important is that it speaks\nin terms of the actions of the parties, because the\nparties institute a suit, not the Court. So it doesn't\nspeak in terms of the power of the Court. And there's\nno evidence, I don't think, that Congress intended to\nwithdraw the broad grant to jurisdiction in 1331 and\n1338. I think Bowles and John R. Sand are cases in\nwhich the Court's own precedents had previously treated\nthe rules at issue as jurisdictional, had accorded them\njurisdictional consequences. So those are cases in\nwhich the Court relied on stare decisis, but I don't\nthink that we have any similar situation here. There's\nno --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ncongressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision?\nIt provided that the -- there was to be no\njurisdictional bar in criminal matters. Didn't -- it\ndidn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it\ndidn't say anything about civil matters. So isn't that\nsome kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the\ncivil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?\nMS. ANDERS: I don't think so. I think, in\nenacting that, Congress had recognized that the\nincentives for registration should stay in place in the\ncivil context, but that making an exception wouldn't --\nwouldn't make a difference in the criminal context.\nI think Congress still spoke of it as a --\nas a non-jurisdictional requirement in the legislative\nhistory, so I don't think that there is any indication\nthat Congress has ratified the Second Circuit's decision\nhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Anders.\nMs. Merritt?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH JONES MERRITT\nAS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT\nOF THE JUDGEMENT BELOW\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Mr. Chief Justice and\nmay it please the Court:\nWe will start with the statutory language as\nthe Court has been discussing for the last half-hour.\nSection 411(a) appears on page 1 of the\nPetitioner's brief. It uses, first, the mandatory word\n\"shall\" in commanding that no action shall be\ninstituted.\nIt does not contain a limitations period, as\nstatutes of limitations do. It simply says, \"No action\nshall be instituted.\" No waiver --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Until.\" That's a\nlimitation period.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Until?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Until preregistration or\nregistration has been made.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: That's correct, Justice\nScalia, and that makes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's our limitation\nperiod.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: That makes -- it's a --\nit's a requirement that registration be made. It is\nquite analogous, although stronger than the statute in\nthe Hallstrom case. The hybrid argument that the\nSolicitor General was referring to is the Court's\ndecision in the Hallstrom case, which was a provision of\nthe environmental statutes that is common in several of\nthose statutes providing: No action may be commenced\nuntil a notice is filed.\nOur provision here is stronger. It says:\n\"No action shall be instituted,\" instead of \"No action\nmay be commenced.\" Even if this case is not -- even if\nthis statute does not impose a jurisdictional limit,\nwhich I will strongly argue that it does, it at the very\nleast imposes a mandatory command like the statute in\nHallstrom. And there is no reason in this case to\nreverse the Second Circuit, even if this is a mandatory\nprovision.\nAs you will recall, in Hallstrom, the\nparties had gone through four years of complicated\nenvironmental litigation. Went up through the court of\nappeals. The court of appeals reversed, saying, you did\nnot comply with this notice provision. This Court held\nthat it did not need to decide whether that provision\nwas jurisdictional in the strictest sense of the term,\nbecause it was at least mandatory. And the Court\nreversed despite that time, sent the case back.\nIn fact, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, you\nasked about whether the mandatory issue would be within\nthe Court's grant of certiorari. The grant of\ncertiorari in Hallstrom referred to the jurisdictional\nissue and the Court decided that rather than get to the\nstrict issue of jurisdiction, it would decide on a\nmandatory forum.\nBut there is no reason, if we are -- if the\nCourt wants to avoid the jurisdictional issue and to\nendorse the mandatory hybrid one, the Second Circuit\nshould still be affirmed in this case. The parties\nraised Section 411(a) quite clearly to the district\ncourt. They used this provision as their major defense\nof both the substance of the settlement's fairness and\nthe representation. The representation was the major\nissue that the objectors raised in the district court.\nAnd so both parties, the Plaintiffs and the defendants,\nargued in their briefs -- and it's simply not a few\nsentences; we've provided the parts of the record in the\nappendix to our brief -- that the reason that this\nsettlement should be upheld was because of this\nmandatory, they called it then, jurisdictional\nprovision. That was an essential argument that they\nmade to the district court and that they then repeated\nto the Second Circuit in the merits briefs long before\nthe circuit said, then: Wait a minute; you are making a\ncurious argument here that this is a jurisdictional\nprovision that upholds your settlement, but that we\nstill have the ability to look at this settlement if\nit's jurisdictional.\nI would like to return to the language of\nSection 411(a). As I have argued, it begins with this\nmandatory language, \"No action shall be maintained.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- aren't there\nstatutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the\nEEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until\nyou have gone to X administrative agency? And those are\nnot considered jurisdictional.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: That's correct. That's\ncorrect, Justice Ginsburg. Many of those statutes refer\nspecifically to exhaustion. The Prison Litigation\nReform Act, for example, that some of the parties cite,\nrefers specifically to exhaustion of remedies after the\n\"no action\" sort of language.\nEvery jurisdictional statute has its own\nlanguage and its own story. We could say they are like\nTolstoy's unhappy families; they are all different. And\nin this case, the story of the Copyright Act and its\nlanguage is very distinctive, both in the public\npurposes that it furthers and in the language that it\nuses.\nAgain, on the statutory language, we have\nthe very mandatory language, \"no action shall be\ninstituted.\" No modifiers; there's no provision for\nwaiver. The Solicitor General's assistant mentioned\nthat this statute is like fee waivers. It's not at all\nlike a fee waiver, because the statute for fee waivers\nexplicitly gives the district judge authority to waive\nthe fee in the case of an in forma pauperis plaintiff.\nThis statute contains no waiver for the parties. It\ncontains no discretion for the district judge.\nAnd in the last word of -- the last sentence\nof this very short three-sentence provision, Congress\nreferred explicitly to jurisdiction. And I would like\nto look very closely at that word, because any plain\nreading of this section will show -- shows that Congress\nintended the entire provision to refer to the\njurisdiction of the court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- that\nlast sentence is just relating to the court can -- has\nauthority to decide this particular issue,\ncopyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen\nnot to enter the suit. The sentence simply says, court,\nyou have authority to decide this question.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: That's the most\nimmediate reference, Justice Ginsburg, but the three\nsentences work together. And if we look at the three\nsentences, they appear on the first page of the\nPetitioner's brief. The first sentence creates two\ncategories of cases: Those that the Court may decide\nand those it may not. Let us say for now we are not\nmeaning what that power is. We are simply saying two\ncategories of cases, one the court may decide, the other\none it may not.\nThe second sentence then adds a small group\nof cases to this first category, the one that the court\nmay decide. As opposing counsel mentioned, Congress did\nthat in response to a particular case, the Vacheron\ncase. Vacheron itself was built on a line of cases\nholding that the previous section like 411(a) was a\njurisdictional limit.\nThe reason that courts could not consider a\ncopy -- an application for -- a petition for\ninfringement complaint, I'm sorry, from a person who had\nnot yet gotten registration was because they construed\nthat predecessor as jurisdictional and therefore, they\nhad no jurisdiction to hear an infringement claim until\nthis person instituted a mandamus suit and got the\ncertificate from the registrant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthat cut against you in the sense that the same\nparagraph Congress used the word \"jurisdiction,\" but\nthey didn't use that in the provision that you are\narguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: No, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbecause when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it\nhad before it 60 years already of courts construing its\nlanguage, no action shall be maintained, which was the\nprevious 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit. There\nhad not been any resistance to that notion.\nEven courts as early as the 1920s in the\nLumiere case, the Second Circuit did not hold there was\n\"jurisdiction,\" but it held that this provision was\nunwaiverable. What the parties want to do here, of\ncourse, is to waive the provision.\nSo the language was working quite nicely for\nCongress. No action shall be maintained, they switched\nit to instituted to make clear that they meant at the\nbeginning of the action. There had been a few parties\nwho had argued during the early 20th century that if\nthey snuck in the door, they could remain inside -- or\nI'm sorry, once they got inside, they could file the --\ncertificate, and the courts rejected that, but Congress\ncleared up that particular problem.\nSo Congress knows that its first sentence is\nworking quite well. Congress then adds this second\nsentence to -- these, of course, are people working with\nthe Copyright Office, experts in the area of copyright\nlaw. Congress adds the second sentence which adds the\nsmall category of cases to the ones that may come before\nthe court. And then in the final sentence, Congress\ngives a clarification about that final group of cases.\nAs Justice Ginsburg said, the -- Congress\nmade clear that when the registrar decides not to appear\nin these cases, the Court may still go on and has the\npower to decide these cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- it's not\na very big deal to register your copyright, right?\nMS. JONES MERRITT: It is not at all a big\ndeal, Your Honor. In fact, for freelance writers one\nmay register an entire year's worth of work on a single\nform for $65.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- but -- but\ndoesn't that mean that it would be odd to make\njurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on\nwhether you've, you know, dotted an \"I\" and crossed a\n\"T\"?\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Not at all, Your Honor,\nbecause again, the copyright statute has a different\nhistory than other jurisdictional statutes. Before\n1909, owners of copyright had to dot every \"I\" and cross\nevery \"T\" within a limited period of time. If they\ndidn't, they lost their entire ownership in the\ncopyright.\nWhat Congress wanted to do in 1909 was to\ngive copyright owners a longer period of time to comply\nwith some of these formalities. But, it still wanted to\npreserve the public interest that registration serves.\nWe haven't talked yet about the major public\ninterest that Congress had in mind here. It is\nironically the very problem that gave rise to this\nlawsuit, trying to find the owner's of copyrighted\nworks.\nBefore using a copyrighted work, any person\nneeds to find the owner to ask permission. The\nelectronic databases in this case have argued that they\nare somehow special, that because they need to obtain\nmany permissions, they shouldn't have to do it.\nUniversities, libraries, archives obtain as\nmany or more permissions as electronic databases in\nevery year. For large universities like Harvard\nUniversity or the Ohio State University, we have to\nobtain permissions for every article that is distributed\nin course packs to our students.\nIf one of those articles is a freelance\nwork, written by Mr. Muchnick, for example, we have to\ntrack him down and get his permission to use that\narticle.\nSo the registration system was Congress's\nresponse to this problem of finding the owners of\ncopyright. In this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it true, though,\nthat -- that most copyright holders, most people who\nwrite articles, freelance articles, even if it's only\n$65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really\ndon't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going\nto infringe, in the first place, and if they did what\nestablishes to be, just wouldn't be economically\nworthwhile? So I think it's a fact that most copyrights\nare not registered, isn't it?\nMS. JONES MERRITT: The beauty, Your Honor,\nthough, of the solution that Congress adopted with the\nregistration, moving the registration to a\njurisdictional element rather than to an element of the\nclaim, as it was in the 19th century, is that the\ncopyright owner may do this any time. Copyright lasts,\nof course, for the lifetime of the owner plus another\n70 years after death. Sixty-nine years after my death,\nmy heirs could register my copyright if they are finding\nthat somebody is now making a lot of money off of my\nworks. And they could then bring an infringement suit\nagainst that person.\nIt's odd to think of a jurisdictional\nrestriction as being a looser element than a claim\nelement, but in this particular story of copyright, it\nis.\nWhat Congress did was to say, we want people\nto own copyrights immediately without complying with\nformality. And in 1976, Congress even extended that to\nunpublished works, so I already have a copyright of the\nnotes I have in front of me and in the e-mails I print\nlast night and so forth.\nWhat Congress said, with this huge sea of\ncopyrighted works, before somebody can bring an\ninfringement action in the Federal court, we want them\nto confer a public benefit. We want them to register\nthe copyright so that other people can find the owner\nand request permission.\nWhat will happen in this case under the\nterms of this settlement is that the defendant who did\nnot take time to find the owners of these works, even\nthough the owners of these works were easier to find\nthan many of the very elusive of works that archives and\nhistorical societies search for, they did not find --\nlook for the owners because they thought it would be too\ndifficult.\nThis settlement now gives the defendants a\nperpetual right to use all of those works without ever\nidentifying the owners, and without the owners ever\nbeing identified on the national copyright register,\nwhich is what Congress wanted.\nIf I want to create a competing database for\nany of the defendants, I have to undertake the arduous\nwork of tracking down all the owners.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's some that\ncan't be found. So if we take your position, there's\nsome that can't be found, we just can't create our\ndatabase.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's the problem\nthat's underlying the fairness of this thing.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: I'm --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In terms of if we take your\napproach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you\nare just out of luck. That is to say, there will not be\ndatabases collected, because they cannot be complete\nbecause we cannot find the owner. If we take the\nposition that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle\ndisappears and now it's a question of the fairness of\nthe situation.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Justice Breyer, that\nconcern exists for everybody, not just for electronic\ndatabases. In fact, there is -- the copyright --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. I just\nwonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of\nprovision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Because Congress wants\nto protect the rights of copyright owners. Congress has\nmore than 200 years' experience balancing these two\ninterests. And, in fact, as we speak, Congress is\nconsidering orphan works legislation to address that\nspecific issue. What Congress has -- and that\nlegislation would apply to all types of works,\nelectronic databases, national archives, historical\ndocumentaries.\nAnd what Congress is proposing in that\nlegislation is quite illustrative. Congress says that\nif somebody makes a diligent search and cannot find the\nowner, then the person may use the work --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the underlying\nfairness. There might be -- maybe they will win on\nthat. I don't know what the merits of that are. But\ncertainly an absolute bar might sometimes help some\ncopyright owners, but many times it will hurt them,\nbecause since they can't be found they can't be\ncompensated. And if we set up a system and put some\nmoney in it, so if they are ever found they will be\ncompensated, that will help them.\nSo that's why I ask the question, why would\na Congress, that wants to help copyright owners create\nthis kind of system? When all the things you are\ntalking about can be brought into play when we consider\nthe fairness of the system.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: This is a -- the system\nthat Congress put in play is, Your Honor, one in which\ncopyright owners have an absolute right to control the\ndisposition of their works. That is the current system,\neven without getting to the jurisdictional issue.\nCongress may change that disposition, and that is within\nCongress's control. What they have been trying to do is\nto balance the interest of the copyright owner with the\ninterest of the public in using works. And that is the\nperennial challenge in copyright law, how to balance\nthose two interests.\nSection 411(a) is actually a vital cog as\npart of that balance, because what Section 411(a) does\nis it says to the copyright owner don't worry about all\nthis business of registering or anything else, you have\nyour copyright, and you will have it for your life plus\n70 years. If it ever becomes important to you to bring\na lawsuit, then you can register at that time, come into\ncourt. It's a deal that Congress has offered to\ncopyright owners in order to strike this particular\nbalance between the public interest and the private\ninterest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they -- if they are\njust suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they\nhave to register before bringing an injunction suit?\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Yes, Your Honor, they\ndo. In order to bring any action -- if the injunction\nis based on infringement. So we're -- if the plaintiff\nbrings an action for infringement and the remedy they\nseek is an injunction, then the copyright must be\nregistered first.\nThere are some cases in the lower courts in\nwhich we have a plaintiff who has a longstanding pattern\nof infringements that a particular defendant has been\nengaged in against that plaintiff. The Owen Mills case\nis an example. A local photography studio was upset\nbecause a photo duplicating shop kept copying their\ncopyrighted photographs. They entered an action for\ninfringement, had registered several of the photographs.\nThe Court issued an injunction that covered future works\nas well, but those were all works within the same\njudicial controversy. So an injunction could reach\nfurther than a single registered work as long as we are\ntalking about one single controversy.\nIn this case we don't have an injunction, we\nhave damages, and we have thousands of different\ncontroversies. As the Court knows the class action\nrules do not change the substantive law or the rules of\n-- of jurisdiction. We have here thousands of different\ncontroversies that have been aggregated for convenience\nunder rule 23(b)(3), but the court must have\njurisdiction over each of those controversies. Or if we\ntake the alternative route of Hallstrom, the hybrid\napproach, and we say that this is a mandatory\nrequirement. Congress has been quite clear about this\nmandatory requirement, and that mandate must be\nsatisfied with respect to every controversy in this\nclass action.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- I just hate\nto reveal my ignorance on something like this, but I had\nthe same problem with your opponent. I really don't\nunderstand why it makes any difference whether you call\na requirement mandatory or you call it jurisdictional in\nterms of the fairness of settlement, all the\nconsiderations you are discussing. It seems to me as a\npractical matter it doesn't seem to make any difference.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: It depends on the brand\nof mandatory, Your Honor. There are in this case three\ndifferent proposals before the Court. I, as appointed\namicus I have argued that Section 411(a) is\njurisdictional which I think the clear history and\nlanguage of the statute, which I will still come back\nto --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But would you not make all\nthe arguments directed at the fairness of the\nsettlements and so forth if it were merely mandatory?\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Yes, because then the\ntwo versions of mandatory are -- the flavor of mandatory\nthat the Solicitor General urges is that the district --\nthis is very mandatory, as in Hallstrom -- even if a\nparty doesn't raise the issue, the district court sua\nsponte should raise the issue on its own.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- so mingle -- rule.\nI think Ms. Anders answered that question. In this\nsituation it would be appropriate for the judge to\naccept the waiver.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: That was -- that was\nwhat Ms. Anders argued. I disagree with that, because\nthe public interest that Congress has put forth here\nwould not be satisfied. The parties in this case argue\nthe same public interests that parties argue in every\ncopyright case. The plaintiffs in a copyright case\nalways argue that their interest should be protected\neven if they haven't complied with Congress's mandates.\nThe defendants in a copyright case always argue that\nallowing them to copy the plaintiffs' works would give\nthe public greater access to those works. There are no\nspecial public interests here.\nIn fact, the electronic databases in this\ncase have been superseded technologically.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we -- if we are\ntalking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for\ninfringement apart from this settlement in the context\nthat we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that\nquestion whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever.\nWhat defendant who is sued for infringement wouldn't\nsay, judge, I'm relying on 411(a); they haven't\nregistered their copyright; they can't sue me? I can't\nimagine a defendant in an ordinary copyright case who\nwouldn't raise it.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Actually there are quite\na number, Your Honor, just as there are defendants who\nwill waive statutes of limitations. There are times\nwhen a defendant would rather have the resolution on the\nmerits, because that then would not allow the plaintiff\nto come back into court and sue again. Or the\ndefendant -- the plaintiff in this case might have sued\n-- that you are referring to -- might have sued for\ninfringement, and the defendant wants to make clear that\nit has the right to use this work. That would then\nestablish that principle with this plaintiff with\nrelated works or with other works.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then let's switch to the\nplaintiff. If the plaintiff is in it for money, for\nreal money, for damages, the plaintiff's going to\nregister because then the stakes are such that $65 is\nwell worth it, if the plaintiff thinks it can get a\nlarge infringement award.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: The problem, Your Honor,\nis that there are many naive people who believe that\nfamous movies and novels have infringed their freshman\ncollege essays. There are cases exactly like that in\nthe courts. And in fact the case I cite in the brief is\none in which the author sued the university, claiming\nthat the department of English obviously had released\nhis freshman essay to Hollywood, because this movie\nbuilt upon his fresh man essay.\nIn those cases, and this is another\ndistinction, Justice Stevens, between mandatory and\njurisdictional, the defendant doesn't even have to\nappear. The district court can sua sponte dismiss the\ncomplaint for lack of jurisdiction. We cite I believe\nseven or eight cases in the brief where exactly that\nhappened, including two different cases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They wouldn't waive it\nthen. I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is\nthis: let's take a group of people who want to make\ndatabases; now they want to use copyrighted material.\nThere is a subset of people who have written it they\ncan't find, so they say here's what we will do. We will\ntake $100 billion, and we will put it in a fund, and\nlike ASCAP, that fund can administer this money for the\nbenefit of anyone who turns up.\nNow, maybe that's illegal under some law.\nMaybe the class isn't right. Maybe they can't get\nproper representation. Maybe it's inadequate, et\ncetera. But what I don't fail to see -- what I fail to\nsee, is how -- whether you could do that or not do it\nhas anything to do with registration, because we are\ntalking about the people who aren't here, all of whom,\nif you ever bring suit when he's found, will register\nthe copyright. The only reason they haven't registered,\nwe don't know who they are, that's why. Maybe they have\nregistered, for all we know.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: All of the people who\nhaven't registered yet, Your Honor, will not be able to\nbring suit, because the class action will extinguish\ntheir claims. That's the important --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe they can't do that\nbecause it would be an unfair result. But where is it\nin this provision of law that's designed to stop that\never from happening?\nMS. JONES MERRITT: This provision, if we go\nback to section --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it won't, by the way.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It depends on what the\nterms of the settlement are. We could have a subclass\nthat allows a subset of those people to come into court.\nNo reason you couldn't. So I don't know whether or not\nit's true that they won't register when they are found.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Justice Breyer, once\nagain the Copyright Act itself already makes that choice\nthat no person may -- and I'm not talking yet even about\nthe jurisdictional provision -- no person may use\nanother's copyrighted work without their permission.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In 1909 Congress thought\nall this through with the databases and so forth?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Oh, yes. The database\nissue -- sometime -- sometimes -- in 1976, by the way,\nCongress did because LEXIS and Westlaw existed before\n1976. The -- but the databases are a red herring here.\nSometimes, technology is different, and,\nsometimes, it's not. The Library of Congress recently\ndid a project in which they sought 7,000 permissions for\na single project because they were digitizing the\nletters of Hannah Arendt.\nThey sought those permissions. They -- if\nthey could not get permission, if they couldn't find the\nauthor or if they didn't get an okay from the author,\nthey had to leave the work off of the web site because\nthey are following copyright law.\nThey have a copy of the original work that\nwas given to them or that they purchased, and they may\ndisplay that, but, if they are going to make a copy of\nthe work, then they have to comply by copyright law.\nI mentioned a moment ago that the databases\nhere have been superseded by technology, and that is\nanother way in which technology is not -- is not\ndifferent in this case. It is now possible for works to\nbe scanned in photographic form or PDF form and put in\nto electronic databases that are fully searchable, and\nthat does not violate copyright law.\nIf you compare, for example, law review\narticles on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why doesn't it? Just\nout of curiosity. You are making a --\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Because it is -- it is\npart of the original collection -- I'm sorry. If the --\nif the publisher of the collected work consents to that.\nI am thinking of this case in The New York Times --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say if somebody\nwho owns the copyright.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Yes. But who owns --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. No. No. But what we\nwant to do is we want to have, in our database, all of\nthe material written about slavery, and, lo and behold,\nthere are 4,000 books that we can't trace. Who, now,\nowns the copyright 100 years later? And there is no way\nto get those into our database. Whether --\nMS. JONES MERRITT: That's correct. That is\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, that's a\nsort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it\nshould be, but it's rather surprising that this law is\nthe law that will answer that question.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: This law relates to the\nquestion, Your Honor, because this law relates to the\naccess to the Court.\nThe way it relates to the question is that\nwhat Congress was trying to do was to give people like\nyou and me information about those copyright owners, so\nthat we could find the owner of the book on slavery.\nAnd, as a way to maintain that register,\nwhich Congress started in 1790, it said, to the authors\nof copyrighted works, if you want to use our courts, the\njudicial powers of the United States, you need to confer\nthis benefit, so that Justice Breyer could find you, if\nhe wants to include your work in the database. And that\nwas the story that Congress did.\nI would like to say just one more word about\nthe word \"jurisdiction\" in the third line of Section\n411(a) because we were interrupted there. The parties\nhave offered no convincing explanation for that word,\nother than to show that Congress understood this whole\nprovision was jurisdictional.\nIt refers, most immediately, to\nregistrability, but that was not a new issue in 1976.\nCourts have always decided registrability. And, as the\nrules of civil procedure make clear to us, a party's\nabsence never deprives a court of subject matter\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the rulemakers got it\nwrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as\njurisdictional. They say copy the 1331, 1338, that is\njurisdictional, and then they put the certificate\nrequirement below the line -- below the jurisdictional\nline.\nSo that was -- well, that was wrong, in your\njudgment.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: As the -- as the\nCongress made -- I'm sorry, as the Court made clear, in\nissuing those forms, they are advisory only, and they\nare not -- they are not intended to give legal advice to\ncounsel about what the issues in the case are.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I suppose, if you picked\nup any copyright complaint, you will see the\njurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and\nnothing about 411.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: And that is quite\ncommon, Your Honor, because, in many situations, what\nCongress has done is given a general grant of\njurisdiction in 1331 or 1338 and then pulled it back for\na subcategory of cases, which is what 411(a) does.\nIn those circumstances, not just in\ncopyright, but in all sorts of areas, the complaint will\nplead jurisdiction under the general grant and then may\nshow that it satisfies the condition later.\nThis is -- we are not arguing that -- and\nthe Second Circuit has not argued that 411(a) is a\njurisdictional grant. It is a section that takes back\npart of the jurisdictional grant in 1331 and 1338.\nCongress has more than 200 years' experience\nworking with copyright law, as the questions today have\nrevealed -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: And the questions today\nhave revealed striking the balance between the public\nand the private interest is a difficult one.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. JONES MERRITT: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sims, you have\ntwo minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SIMS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI, first, want to correct the misimpression\ngiven that the databases think they are special. The\ndatabases haven't thought they don't need to get\npermission. They thought they had permission under\nSection 201(c), and this Court had the case and\ndecided -- two of you believed we were right, and more\nof you believed we were wrong, but the databases took no\nposition that they had no obligation.\nThey got the rights by contract from the\npublishers, with representations and warranties, and\nthat's why, when this case was instituted, they went to\nmediation. They resolved this in a way. They got money\nfrom the publishers, who were exposed under\nrepresentations and warranties.\nThe authors were represented by the three\nmajor national freelance author groups in the country,\nand this was a way, we thought, to address this problem\nresponsibly and without taking the Court's time.\nNow, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, you said a\ncouple of times that you wonder whether the language\nhere, \"No action shall be instituted,\" doesn't sound\njurisdictional, and exactly to the contrary, the Court's\ndecision of Jones v. Bock, which, I think -- if I am\nremembering, you authored, but, in any event, it was\nwithin a year or two, said that was boilerplate language\nused all the time for statutes of limitations that are\nnot jurisdictional. And, indeed, that is correct.\nIn the footnote of our reply brief, we list\nthree times in the 19th century when that very language\nwas used for statutes of limitations. And, if you put\nit into LEXIS or Westlaw, you will get a zillion\nstatutes with respect to -- exhaust nonjurisdictional\nstatutes.\nSo I think, quite to the contrary, that --\nthat is the language Congress uses when it wants\nsomething to be not jurisdictional.\nNow, Ms. Merritt began with the word\n\"shall,\" in 411(a). I want to be clear. This case was\ninstituted in compliance with 411(a). The named\nplaintiffs registered their works and came into court.\nIt went to mediation, and the next thing the court knew,\nit had a settlement agreement to review, and it did\nreview under Rule 23.\nShe relies on the Hallstrom case, but, of\ncourse, the Hallstrom case, which did avoid saying\nwhether it was mandatory or jurisdictional, involved the\nenforcement of a mandatory -- at least mandatory rule,\non the application of a party, and that's what the Court\ndoes, and that's why, to some extent, other than with\nrespect to settlement agreements, this case doesn't\nmatter a lot because the defendants will always be\nraising this defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Merritt, you were appointed by this\nCourt as an amicus to defend the judgment below, and you\nhave ably discharged that responsibility.\nOn behalf of the Court, thank you for doing\n"
