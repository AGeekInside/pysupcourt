        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Davis v. Washington.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMichelle McCottry's statements here were\ntestimonial for the simple reason that she knowingly\ntold a governmental agent associated with law\nenforcement that someone had committed a crime.\nProsecutions based on such ex parte statements in place\nof live testimony strike at the very heart of the evil\nthe Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent:\ntrials on the basis of out-of-court accusations.\nIndeed, the trial here really can't be\ndescribed as anything other than inquisitorial in\nnature. The sole proof that Mr. Davis was at Ms.\nMcCottry's house and assaulted her that day was the 4-\nminute, tape-recorded 911 police incident interview\nthat the State played at Mr. Davis' trial and that it\nitself described as Ms. McCottry's testimony on the day\nthis happened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Counsel, when you say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does the fact that it's\nsole proof mean that it's testimonial?\nMR. FISHER: It --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- it -- it adds to the\ngeneral appeal of your case I -- I suppose, but what\ndoes that have to do with whether or not it's\ntestimonial?\nMR. FISHER: It doesn't -- it doesn't answer\none way or another whether it's testimonial. What it\ndoes and what I'm trying to do for this Court is,\nfirst, draw back the lens for a moment and look at the\nkind of trial that we end up with when statements of\nthe -- like fresh accusations in this case, are able to\nbe used in place of live testimony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did use the word\ninquisitorial, and there's one large difference, it\nseems. This is not a magistrate judge or a police\nofficer coming to a person for an interview. This is\ninitiated by the caller, by the victim, and it's\ninitially a cry for help.\nMR. FISHER: Let -- let me address that\nquestion in two parts. The first part you've\nmentioned, Justice Ginsburg, is whether it matters that\nthe -- that the operator is not a police officer, and\nwe submit no.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I didn't say that.\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I said that the call was\ninitiated by the victim. It wasn't a -- a police\nofficer coming to interview her.\nMR. FISHER: I see. Well, we don't believe,\nunder the proper conception of the Confrontation\nClause, it matters who the accusatory statement is\ninitiated by. Certainly we believe the Confrontation\nClause should apply if Ms. McCottry had simply walked\nout of her house and walked down the street to the\npolice station and voluntarily walked into the\nsheriff's office and said, I want to report what Mr.\nDavis just did. What we -- what we suggest here today\nis there's no difference if she simply calls on the\ntelephone to a 911 operator, which the State itself in\nits brief calls a conduit to the police, and so when\nthe -- when the police and when the State have set up a\nsystem for people to report calls more expeditiously --\nI'm sorry -- report crimes more expeditiously, we don't\nthink the answer is any different.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're splitting up two\nthings that I think go together. That is, this is not\njust a call. This is a cry for help.\nMR. FISHER: Well, there -- in -- in a sense,\nof course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same\ntime she's reporting a crime, but the -- the mere fact\nthat the two are intertwined does not take us outside\nthe Confrontation Clause. Of course, in the Indiana\ncase that you're going to hear, you're going to hear\nthe same thing, that the person is asking for help in\nthe same way. So when somebody makes a call, which we\nmight call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call, the\nquestion that we think this Court should ask is whether\n-- whether that's the kind of a statement, first of\nall, that historically would have been viewed as\nimplicating the Confrontation Clause. And if you look\nat the hue -- the old hue and cry practice that we've\nreferred to in our briefs, Sir Matthew Hale in his\ntreatise explains that when somebody went and got the\nlocal constable, what they were doing is they were\nseeking help, first and foremost, to apprehend a felon,\nand more than that, they were also reporting the crime\nin the first instance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it your argument that any\nstatement made to law enforcement is testimonial?\nMR. FISHER: Well, you certainly don't have\nto go that far in this case, Your Honor, but -- but we\nbelieve --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought that's what you\nsaid in your argument when you started off.\nMR. FISHER: Certainly any statement\ndescribing criminal activity to a law enforcement\nofficer would be testimonial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you started out by\nsaying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was\nto keep out the accusations made out of court, but I\nwould have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay\nrule. And if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule,\nhow does the Confrontation Clause differ?\nMR. FISHER: The purpose of the hearsay rule,\nJustice Breyer, is to police the reliability of out-of-\ncourt statements. What this Court said in Crawford is\nthe Confrontation Clause is something much different.\nIt regulates the manner of taking testimony in criminal\ntrials.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it's not the purpose\nof the Confrontation Clause to keep out out-of-court\naccusations. Only some, and which, and what's the\nrule?\nMR. FISHER: Well, we believe the rule is, is\nthat any accusatory statement to a law enforcement\nofficer or to an agent of the law -- of law enforcement\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you do believe that,\nbut I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not\nthe hearsay --\nMR. FISHER: Well, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- rather the confrontation.\nMR. FISHER: -- the history of the\nconfrontation right, going back even prior to the\nframer, was to bring the accuser and the accused face\nto face so that the accuser made his or her accusation\nin the presence of the accused and subject to cross\nexamination. And the very heart of the Confrontation\nClause, which this Court has said itself over and over\nagain is to require the accuser to -- to deliver the\naccusation in court, and so accusatory statements,\nthose that say he did it, this is what happened, this\nis what I saw, are different than ordinary hearsay.\nAnd -- and I -- to take an example from -- that we\ntalked about in the Crawford argument, Justice Breyer,\nwhen somebody says pass the -- pass the pewter urn from\nthe mantle, that's where Bob keeps the drugs, that's\nthe kind of a statement that is very different than\npointing the finger at somebody to a law enforcement\nagent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I point the finger\nin an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you\nknow. I -- I don't want to get involved. I'm in a\nforeign country. I sign my name. I even do it under\noath, and I send it right to the judge that's trying\nthe case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the\njudge. You don't think the Confrontation Clause would\ncover that?\nMR. FISHER: Absolutely, Justice Scalia, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your thesis that\nit applies to just accusatory statements to a law\nenforcement officer has to be expanded a little.\nMR. FISHER: It does, and what I'm giving you\nis a -- a rule that I think is the kernel, the heart of\nthe confrontation right. You don't have to say much\nmore than that if it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about --\nwhat if you -- what if somebody runs out of the -- the\nhouse? There are two people standing in the yard, a\nlaw enforcement officer and the next-door neighbor.\nShe yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to\nkill me, and then he comes out. Is that covered by\nyour rule? It's not to a law enforcement officer.\nIt's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement\nofficer overhears it.\nMR. FISHER: I think statements that law\nenforcement officer merely overhear may not be\ntestimonial, and one of the reasons for that is this\nCourt's Bourjaily decision, which it cited with\napproval in Crawford, is if somebody make -- if\nsomebody makes statements that tend out -- that turn\nout to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere\nfact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers\nor even an undercover officer eliciting the statement\nis in a different scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, than\nsomebody making a statement to law enforcement or even\n-- and I want to make sure I understand your\nhypothetical. If the person realized that a police\nofficer was standing there and hearing what she was\ntelling her neighbor, we may then have a testimonial\nsituation.\nBut in this case what we have is not simply a\nblurting out or a cry for help. In fact, Ms. McCottry\nnever asked for help. She said she didn't need an aid\ncar. What we have are a series of 26 questions that\nthe 911 operator asked Ms. McCottry that established\nevery element of the crime the court -- I'm sorry --\nthat the State ultimately proved.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was she calling 911 for\nif she didn't want help?\nMR. FISHER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, she -- she wanted\nsomething from 911. What did she -- what did she want?\nDid she want the police to come over and arrest her\nhusband? Was that -- or --\nMR. FISHER: I think that's a fair inference,\nJustice Scalia. Of course, we don't know because she\nwas never -- she's never herself submitted to cross\nexamination. But there are mandatory arrest laws in\nthe State of Washington. She had a no-contact order\nagainst Mr. Davis, both of which a reasonable person\nwould understand that a call for 911 would be\ntantamount to a call for arrest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- you said we\ndon't know, but you -- that's slightly in conflict with\nwhat you said earlier. They asked 26 questions. How\nlong was this telephone conversation between the 911\noperator and the victim?\nMR. FISHER: It's about 4 minutes, Justice\nGinsburg. And it's not -- what we submit is -- of\ncourse, we've given you in the joint appendix the\nstructured protocol that the 911 operator was following\nin this case, and we submit that it's not mere\nhappenstance that the 911 call was able to establish\nevery element of the crime, right down to Mr. Davis'\nbirth date that the prosecutor referred to in her\nclosing argument that the 911 operator elicited from\nMs. McCottry. And, indeed, the only question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that\nwas -- I thought that was to determine if there were\noutstanding orders and warrants against the individual.\nMR. FISHER: It may be, and that may be\nanother example, Mr. Chief Justice, of a -- of a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's related --\nthat's related to sending people to prevent crime as\nopposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.\nMR. FISHER: I don't want to dispute that 911\noperators in this situation, just like responding\nofficers, are gathering information for dual purposes.\nThey may well be trying to resolve an ongoing threat\nof a felon at large. At the same time, of course, all\nof the information and training manuals that we've\nprovided to you in the reply brief make it clear that\nfrom the initial contact with the alleged victim, they\nare gathering evidence all the while.\nAnd in fact, the only thing you can think of\n-- at least, I can't think of a single question that a\nprosecutor might have asked at a trial that the 911\noperator didn't ask here. The only questions that\nreally immediately come to mind are ones that might\nhave been asked in cross examination. For example --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the only\nquestion -- what if a 911 caller says nothing more\nthan, in a very excited way, someone is attacking me,\nsend a police officer right away to make the person\nstop attacking me? Is that testimonial?\nMR. FISHER: To the extent that the person is\nsaying someone is attacking me, that kernel may -- may\nwell be testimonial, Justice Alito. However, if\nsomebody calls 911 and says, please send help to 911\nMain -- or 3312 Main Street, that may well not be\ntestimonial. And that -- a mere cry for help -- and\nthis goes to Justice Ginsburg's question as well. A\nsimple cry for help may -- may not be testimonial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But a simple cry for help\nthat doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an\nimmediate response on the part of the police. This\nkind of call, I need help now, and the information that\ncomes with it is likely to be given priority attention\nas this very call was.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's a fair inference,\nbut the -- the priority attention, in terms of going\nand apprehending Mr. Davis, is exactly what triggers\ncriminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind\nof a statement, the one that the -- one that the\nConfrontation Clause should care about.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not\nsending someone -- they're not sending someone to\napprehend Mr. Davis. They're sending someone to\nprevent him from attacking his wife.\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure it's easy to\nseparate one from the other, Mr. Chief Justice. The\nway that they are doing that is by arresting him. They\nhave a mandatory arrest law in Washington that says\nthat the way that the police must respond to a call\nlike this is to arrest --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? I\n-- I guess in an awful lot of these cases there's a\nmixed motive: protection and enforcement. Is it\nyour view that whenever there's a mixed motive, it\nbecomes inadmissible?\nMR. FISHER: No, Justice Stevens. It's our\nview that you really ought not be looking or focusing\non the police officer motive or on the governmental\nagent's motive for the very reason that you start to\nget into these knotty questions of what exactly were\nthey trying to accomplish. And we believe a better\n-- a better default than -- if you can't simply answer\nit by looking at history and precedent, is to look more\ntowards the declarant's reasonable expectation. And\nthat's what this Court does in the Fifth Amendment when\nit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in doing that, do you\ndistinguish, for example, between the -- the\nexpectation that lies behind a merely excited\nutterance, on the one hand, and the expectation or lack\nof expectation that would qualify -- that would be the\ncase in a -- in a true res gestae statement in the very\nstrict sense? So that, you know, if -- if the attack\nhad occurred 30 minutes beforehand and -- and the\nvictim is saying on the telephone to the police, Adrian\nis trying to kill me, that would be -- that -- that\nwouldn't -- would not be admissible, I take it, on --\non your view under the Confrontation Clause. And yet,\nif in the course of the 911 call, Adrian was battering\nthe -- the -- you know, the victim over the head with\nsomething and she blurted out the same statement, he's\ntrying to kill me, would the -- would the latter be\nadmissible in your case --\nMR. FISHER: The latter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- under your theory?\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. I misspoke. On\nyour theory.\nMR. FISHER: The latter is a very close case,\nJustice Souter. I think you're right insofar as it --\nit can be important to distinguish between a modern-day\nexcited utterance and what would have been considered a\nres gestae type statement at common law.\nCertainly if you take away the 911 call from\nyour hypothetical and she says, please don't hurt me,\nAdrian, that may well be the kind of a statement that\nwould be inside the res gestae. Once somebody picks up\nthe phone to call 911, that, by my reading of the\nhistorical cases, turns it into a report or a\nnarrative.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that the answer to my\nquestion is there would be no distinction between the\nmerely excited utterance 30 seconds later and the\nutterance in the course of in -- in my hypo.\nMR. FISHER: We believe that as long as it is\nmaking a report to a third party, there ought not be a\ndistinction. Now, of course, you don't have to wrestle\nwith that in this case because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say according to your\nreading of the cases, but you really don't have a case\nlike this. You -- you have a case where, after the\nfact, the -- the victim went to a constable or to some\nother official to report the event, and perhaps to seek\nhelp against the person who -- but you don't have\nanything where really, in the course -- in the course\nof the attack or -- or while the person is still at\nleast under threat, a -- a constable is -- is called,\ndo you?\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, of course,\nwe didn't have telephone technology, so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could have -- you could\nhave somebody walking by -- a policeman walking by\noutside.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the victim shouting, you\nknow, please, somebody help me, Harry is beating me.\nYou don't have a case like that. So -- so I don't know\nwhy we should flop one side rather than the other on\nthis -- on this case that -- that doesn't seem covered\nby -- by the old jurisprudence. Why should we go your\nway on it and say that it -- it falls within the\nprohibition rather than say it falls outside the\nprohibition?\nMR. FISHER: Well, for two reasons, Justice\nScalia. One is we do have the hue and cry scenario\nthat we've talked about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's not this\ncase.\nMR. FISHER: And we think the fair --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That --\nMR. FISHER: It's not exactly on all fours\nwith this case, but we think the fair inference, when\nyou read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds\nof statements were kept out, is that if they simply --\nif the police or their agents were able to get the\nstatement just a little bit sooner, the answer would\nhave been the same.\nAnd we do have cases, Justice Scalia, where\npeople made fresh accusations or cry-outs to private\nparties to -- to another -- to a witness who wasn't\neven associated with law enforcement, and we have a\nwhole section of our brief pointing out that for\ndecades after the founding, even those kinds of\nstatements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials\nfor the reason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because of the -- because of\nthe Confrontation Clause you think?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I -- I think it's a fair\ninference, Justice Scalia, from reading the historical\nprecedent and the treatises that describe it. They --\nthey describe these as, in -- in a sense, second-class\ntestimony. They say the problem with statements like\nthis, if they're made even seconds after the event in\nplace, is that they're -- at that point they're nothing\nmore than a narrative and require us to give credit to\na statement -- and this is the words the treatise\nwriters used to use -- that was not given under the\nordinary tests for determining the accuracy of\ntestimony. And when they used the word like testimony\nand they talk about the usual tests and the customary\nway of testing out-of-court statements, I think the\nfair inference is they're referring to the right to\nconfrontation.\nPerhaps another way to think about this is to\ntake a step back and say, what if we decide that\nstatements like this are not testimonial? The\npractical -- the practical impact of that is not simply\nthat these statements won't -- will come in, but that\nprosecutors and -- prosecutors, Federal and State\ngovernment, will have no incentive whatsoever to ever\nbring 911 callers into court. It -- it is -- across\nState hearsay law across the country, these are deemed\nexcited utterances. So if this Court were to say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not --\nthat's not true at all. I mean, if -- if the -- the\nwitness may be a good witness and compelling on the\nstand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in\nperson. This is only addressed to the situations where\nthe witness is unwilling or unable to testify.\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think you\ngot to the heart of the matter when you said that if\nit's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on.\nThe flip side of that is that if the witness isn't so\ngood, the prosecutor would have every incentive at\nleast not to put them on the stand. Why would somebody\nput on a stand -- put somebody on a stand that doesn't\nseem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment\nwhen they have, in a sense, testimony in a sealed tape\nrecorder already?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume the defendant\ncould summon that -- that witness if -- if that\nwitness' location was known. No?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the defendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And could find out from the\nprosecution where that witness was, I assume.\nMR. FISHER: The defendant might be able to\ndo that. But, of course, that would -- treating the\ncase this way would collapse the confrontation right\ninto the Compulsory Process Clause. The confrontation\nright is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into\ncourt. It's to be confronted with the witnesses\nagainst --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice Scalia's\nquestion raises the -- the point. The reason these\nwitnesses are not there is not because of anything that\nthe government has done. It's -- it's the concern they\nhave, the particular domestic abuse situation. It's\nnot the government that is keeping these witnesses out.\nThey're not relying on the 911 calls as a matter of\npreference.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nyour assumption may not be entirely correct. There's a\n-- there's a portion from, for example, the San Diego\nprosecutor's office decided, and I believe in the NACDL\nbrief, that says oftentimes they do prefer to -- to\nleave the witness off the stand because they have a\nbetter case just using the -- the excited utterance\ntype statements.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there --\nsuppose the defendant procured the witness' absence by\na threat.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the 911 statement\ncould come in. Right?\nMR. FISHER: That's right. That's right.\nAnd perhaps -- and this gets back to the Chief\nJustice's question as well. It helps maybe to separate\nthese kinds of cases into three categories.\nWe first have the category that the\nprosecution would prefer not to put the person on the\nstand. We think there the Confrontation Clause ought\nto require them to do so.\nWe -- we next have the category where the\ndefendant, as you say, procures the witness' absence.\nWe don't dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture\ndoctrine kicks in, which this Court reaffirmed in\nCrawford. We don't have any forfeiture question in\nthis case.\nAnd then we have perhaps the gray area, where\na witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's,\nand this Court has said over and over again that there\nthe confrontation right puts the onus onto the\nprosecution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those are -- those are\nthree neat legal categories. The practical reality, is\nit not so, is that many women in these situations are\nscared to death of what will happen to them or they're\nso insecure financially that they think they have to\nput up with the battering? So your neat legal\ncategories really don't conform to what happens in\npeople's lives who are in this situation.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't want\nto be insensitive to -- to witnesses in this situation.\nOf course, reluctant witnesses is nothing new, but --\nbut in domestic violence, it's an acute problem.\nHowever, we believe the proper way to deal\nwith that situation is by this Court developing its\nforfeiture doctrine. The Sixth Amendment applies\nacross the board to all criminal cases, Justice\nGinsburg, and we've cited, for example, in the appendix\nto our reply brief about 30 cases from the last couple\nyears that have been handled in a victimless fashion\nlike this that are not domestic violence cases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would you do that? How\nwould you do that forfeiture?\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would you do that? I'm\ninterested in that because I thought it sounded good.\nThen I thought about it. I thought to have forfeiture,\nyou'd have to show that this defendant, in fact, forced\nthe wife not to testify. It's a crime to do that. So\nyou'd have to prove another crime against the defendant\nin order to prove the first crime. And I thought\nperhaps that doctrine is not very practical. You tell\nme why it is.\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's already what\nhappens under the Federal Rules of Evidence and under\nthe evidence of many States, that there is a rule of\nforfeiture by wrongdoing. And so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. My point\nis that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even\nharder than to prove the original crime. All we know\nis the wife isn't there.\nMR. FISHER: I'm not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And we suspect that she's\nafraid of her husband. He may have offered to cut off\nfinancial aid, said goodbye, no money, or he may have\ndone worse. I'm just saying you're telling us that\nbecause the prosecution can prove that in court and\nonly then will it be able to introduce the testimony\ngiven beforehand by the missing wife.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does it work?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think we have -- Justice\nBreyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a\npretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of\ncourse, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the\nway they would in the guilt phase. So in this very\ncase, if you look at the joint appendix, when -- when\non the eve of trial Ms. McCottry is no longer going to\nshow up for trial, the prosecutor says, I want to\nsubpoena the jail records and I want to talk to the\nvictim's advocate to find out whether she's been\nintimidated or kept away. So the prosecutor herself\ntells the court how she's going to look for this\nevidence. If she had found anything, presumably she\nwould have presented it and she could have presented it\nthat way. And it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we should just -- just\nsuspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse cases\ninstead of designing the entire application of the\nConfrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of what\nseems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.\nMR. FISHER: Well, of course, Justice Scalia,\nthe Sixth Amendment says all criminal prosecutions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand.\nMR. FISHER: -- and domestic violence cases\nare criminal prosecutions. So we don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I suppose we could also\nhave said that the Sixth Amendment, like some other\namendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions --\nMR. FISHER: That's right, but we've --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Confrontation\nClause portion of it, anyway --\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which would exempt spousal\nabuse cases, by and large, until we -- until we enact a\nFederal spousal abuse statute, which -- which may well\noccur. It seems to me there -- there are better ways to\n-- to solve this problem than to design the whole\nConfrontation Clause jurisprudence on the basis of what\nhappens in spousal abuse cases.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's a fair comment.\nAnd let -- let me say there are two -- there\nare many ways that you can do that, Justice Scalia, and\ntwo of them were readily available to the State in this\ncase. One is even when a witness goes missing or is\nunwilling to testify in a hard case, there may well be\nother ways to prove the case. Here, the caller said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is true, but the reason\nI thought spousal abuse cases are relevant --\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: A reason I thought they were\nrelevant is just what you're about to address. They're\nevidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring\nsomething within the Confrontation Clause. Prior to\nCrawford, even though it was within the clause, if it\nfell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay\nrule, it could come in. So you could bring in co-\nconspirators before the conspiracy ended. You could\nbring in, for sure, excited utterances. You could\nbring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how\nreliable, you have to keep them out.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Breyer,\nbut --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so that is a problem\nthat you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly\nnarrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line\nis with spousal abuse and other cases in mind.\nMR. FISHER: Let me give you two ways this\ncase, if -- if we assume the State's version of\nevents is correct, could have easily been proved.\nOne is that the caller said that a man named\nMike was at her house during the entire event. When\nthe police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later,\nthey never even got Mike's last name. And, of course,\nJustice Breyer, the reason why is because they were\nprobably thinking of the Roberts framework and that\nthey wouldn't need this witness, but good old-fashioned\npolice work would have presumably found a witness that\nwitnessed the whole event that they could have put on\nthe stand.\nThe second thing the State could have done in\nthis case is they could have filed the case in a way\nthat they obtained a preliminary hearing. If what the\nState says is correct that Ms. McCottry was cooperating\nup until the last minute, that's a classic scenario\nwhere, by way of having a preliminary hearing and\nsubjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary\nhearing, they could have preserved her testimony. This\nCourt in California against Green and Roberts itself\nsaid that those kinds of prior pretrial cross\nexamination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the\nConfrontation Clause.\nAnd if the Court has no further questions,\nI'll reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFisher.\nMr. Whisman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. WHISMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WHISMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nIn this 911 call, the operator asked a short\nseries of questions, nearly all phrased in the present\ntense. Each question was objectively and reasonably\nnecessary to respond to an apparent emergency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Like what is his name? I\nmean, that's the present tense. Not what was his name\nor what will be his name. What is his name? You think\nthat's the present tense. So that shows that this is\nall seeking help.\nMR. WHISMAN: No, a number of other\nquestions, Justice Scalia, were answered -- were asked\nin the present -- present tense too. And, in fact, the\noperator, shortly after asking the first questions, one\nof the first things that she said was help was on the\nway and then continued with a series of questions. But\nas the interview continued, of course, every single\nquestion and every single answer was captured on the\ntape for a jury or a judge to later hear. The call\nended after the operator knew that Ms. McCottry had her\ndoor locked, that Davis had left, and that the\nofficer's arrival was imminent.\nWe ask -- respectfully ask this Court, under\nthese circumstances, to hold that the use of this\npowerful evidence, without live testimony from the\ndeclarant, was constitutionally permissible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, powerful is part\nof the problem. This -- this kind of telephone call\nevidence is even more powerful than -- than the kind of\na signed affidavit that used to be banned because it\nwas testimonial. I mean, to hear -- to hear the voice\non the phone makes it, if it is -- if it is\nimpermissible under the Confrontation Clause, it makes\nit even a more damaging violation than the kind of\nviolation that -- that occurred in -- in Sir Walter\nRaleigh's case, for example.\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, I'd respectfully\ndisagree, Your Honor, although I'd -- I'd first note\nthat -- that I think the if clause in Your Honor's\nquestion is telling. And I think if that -- that\ndoesn't necessarily define whether it's testimonial or\nnot. But to address --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -- would you\nrather put the woman on -- if you had a choice, would\nyou rather put the woman on the stand?\nMR. WHISMAN: Absolutely, Your Honor, and --\nand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Rather than have her -- her\nvoice on the telephone call --\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, if I had to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- when she is -- she is in\n-- in -- supposedly in great fear of -- of her husband\nand -- and -- I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone\ncall.\nMR. WHISMAN: If you're asking me which would\nI chose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a prosecutor.\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, if I had to chose, that\nwould be a difficult choice, obviously, but our plan,\nof course, was to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it would be an easy\nchoice.\nMR. WHISMAN: Our -- our plan was to do both,\nand it wasn't until the eve of trial that we learned\nthat the complaining witness, Ms. McCottry, wasn't\ngoing to appear. And I think that the circumstances --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did you subpoena her\nat that point?\nMR. WHISMAN: She was already subpoenaed,\nYour Honor, and the prosecutor brought in the\ndetective. The detective attempt -- made numerous\nattempts to get a hold of her, checked her last known\naddress. The person there didn't know where she was.\nWe had one phone number for her. She wasn't responding\nto the telephone calls pursuant to our calls to that\nnumber. So we made a number of efforts that are\ndocumented in the record to get her to court, once we\nlearned that -- that she didn't appear.\nNow, at that point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your -- your\nposition is not that anything that she says or anything\nanyone says in a 911 call is -- is consistent with the\nConfrontation Clause.\nMR. WHISMAN: That's right, Your Honor. It's\nconceivable that you could have statements made in the\ncourse of a 911 call that wouldn't be testimonial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is your --\nwhat is your test? We have your friend saying any\naccusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer.\nWhat -- what is your proposal?\nMR. WHISMAN: Our focus, Your Honor, is, as I\nthink this Court focused in Crawford on whether or not\nthe government's practice resembles the inquisitorial\nabuses. In other words, did you have -- in the modern\nsense, did you have a structured police interrogation\nsuch that the interrogator or the questioner might have\nin some way shaped the witness' testimony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher tells us\nthat's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes\nthrough the elements of the crime in a very structured\nway.\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, I -- I think if you\nlisten to the tape itself, you'll conclude that's not\nthe case. I mean, in fact, each question that the --\nthat the operator asked was reasonably and objectively\ndesigned to facilitate a quick response and to solve\nthe emergency that was apparent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's not overread\nCrawford. Crawford didn't say that the only thing the\nConfrontation Clause was directed at was the kind of\nabuse that -- that occurred in the case of Sir Walter\nRaleigh. It said that that was the principal abuse at\nwhich it was directed. I doubt very much, unless you\nthink otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation\nfrom the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the\naffidavit, and gave it to the police, I doubt whether\nthat would have been allowed under the Confrontation\nClause. Do you think it would have?\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, it may not have, Your\nHonor, but the -- under the test that we're proposing,\nthe -- we're placing the focus on situations like this,\nsituations roughly analogous -- situations that are\ndistinguishable from what you had with Sylvia Crawford.\nAnd I think that although -- although our test may not\ncover every conceivable hypothetical, I think that, as\nthis Court recognized in Crawford, defining testimonial\nwas going to be a -- a task that was going to take some\ntime, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your test wouldn't cover the\nexample I just gave.\nMR. WHISMAN: Yes, right -- that's right, Your\nHonor. Our test would not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that that\nshould be admissible in a criminal trial?\nMR. WHISMAN: No, I don't. I think it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. WHISMAN: -- that should be inadmissible,\nbut it should be inadmissible because of the rules of\nhearsay. And I think in most States in the Union, it\nwould be inadmissible. I can't think of a hearsay\nexample that would permit it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, now the person disappears\nafterwards, is unavailable.\nMR. WHISMAN: Fair enough. But it's not an\nexcited utterance. It's not a present sense\nimpression. I can't imagine a hearsay exception that\nwould admit it, which is really what brings us back to\nthe core of our theory, too, and that is that -- that\nunder the Confrontation Clause, as defined in Crawford,\nwe now have an absolute rule covering a finite --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't imagine that that\nwouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause\n--\nMR. WHISMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- such -- such an obvious\nviolation of your right to confront your accuser, and\njust because it was presented to the police without --\nwithout an initial interrogation by the police, I don't\nthink that would have made any difference at common\nlaw.\nMR. WHISMAN: And -- and, Your Honor, it may\nbe that at some point the Court expands the definition\nin -- in Crawford of testimonial -- formalized\ntestimonial materials to include something like that,\nbut I think that in situations where you have an\nencounter between police and citizen and statements\nresult, then I think it's fair to focus on the\ninteraction and whether or not the -- the person was\ntrying to shape the testimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree that that's the\nextreme, but you're urging us to -- to adopt a test\nthat embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the\nhypothetical I just gave you. And you -- you can\naccept that hypothetical without saying that you lose\nthis case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing\nis -- is really quite extreme.\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, Your Honor, as I say, the\ntest we're proposing I think would cover the majority\nof cases. The hypothetical that Your Honor posed was\n-- is -- is itself I think somewhat unusual. We -- we\ndo not get statements of that nature. We do not see\nthem being offered into evidence. And as I say, I\nthink that if -- if we saw cases like that, if we saw\nstatements that were admitted, there may be other ways\nunder the clause that the Court could interpret the\nConfrontation Clause to exclude them.\nI'm not arguing for the admissibility of that\nevidence. Quite frankly, I've never in my life even\nseen a piece of evidence like that offered. All I'm\nsaying is that I don't believe it falls under this\nnarrow definition of the Confrontation Clause that you\noutlined in the Crawford case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't you incorporate\nwhat the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you\ndraw the line at urgent emergency statements that are\ncalling for -- for immediate help?\nMR. WHISMAN: We certainly don't have any\nobjections to the Solicitor General's approach, Your\nHonor, and -- and in fact, in some ways, because we're\nanalyzing a case like this that arose in an emergency\ncircumstance, I think that it's clear that -- that\nstatements that are made in those circumstances, just\nby their very nature, aren't going to be testimonial.\nPeople don't testify in an emergency. We chose not to\ntake that approach doctrinally just because we didn't\nthink it was as closely tied to the approach the Court\ntook in Crawford. But I think it's certainly\nconsistent with the strategy outlined by the Solicitor\nGeneral.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do we do about\nthe -- about the fact, which I don't think you -- you\ndeny and -- and the -- the other side points out in\nboth of these cases that, in fact, police departments\nhave their responders to the 911 number intentionally\nask a series of questions that gives them all the\ninformation they need to conduct a prosecution? In\nother words, they are using 911 as a -- as a\nprosecutorial device.\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, I think that overstates\nthe empirical evidence, Your Honor. I think that if\nyou look at the training manual in this case that we\nattached to our briefing in the Supreme Court and refer\nto our briefing, if you look at the way that this\ninterview was conducted, it's clear that these\noperators are not, as a routine matter, using the 911\nprocess to develop evidence.\nIn fact, in this case you'll note that --\nthat after the short 4-minute period, the operator\ndidn't say, well, stay on the line with me a little bit\nmore and let's talk about the background situation\nhere. And she didn't do that because her training, as\ndocumented in the training materials from the Valley\nCommunications Center, said don't get caught up in the\nbackground information that led to this event because\nit can distract you in getting the information that\nneeds to be transferred to the police department right\naway. And I think that that is a perfectly reasonable\nand really the -- the better approach for a 911\noperator. So even though --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did -- did she wait until\nafter the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she --\nshe have the police on the way after the first minute?\nMR. WHISMAN: It sounds as though that she\ndispatched them immediately, Your Honor, because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: She -- she's just typed\nthat out on the computer or something like that?\nMR. WHISMAN: That's right. And, in fact,\nthere are some times when you can hear all three voices\non the 911 tape, not in this instance. But as I said,\nalmost immediately after the call began, she said, help\nis on the way, that's because you can dispatch but\nstill obtain information, for example, the date of\nbirth. And as Mr. Chief Justice indicated, date of\nbirth of the defendant and name, et cetera are\nextremely important so that in those 4 minutes that it\n-- coincidentally, it was also 4 minutes before the\npolice officer arrived -- they can be determining\nwhether or not the defendant has criminal history.\nThey can determine whether or not, from their records\navailable to them in their police car, whether or not the\ndefendant has a history of assaults against police\nofficers, whether or not he has a -- a history of\ncarrying weapons, et cetera. So that's all information\nthat the operators are trained to -- to obtain and then\nto transfer to the police as soon as possible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And she's -- she's in\nongoing -- the operator is in ongoing contact with the\npeople she's -- the operator has dispatched. Right?\nMR. WHISMAN: Correct, Your Honor, and that's\nwhy -- that's why ordinarily the operator doesn't\nterminate the call until the police have arrived on the\nscene. Here it appears that she terminated the call\nsomewhat contemporaneously with their arrival. She --\nshe indicates that the police are there and they'll\nlook around for him quickly and then come and check\nher.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you have to say\nabout the failure to inquire about Mike?\nMR. WHISMAN: Your Honor, I -- I don't think\nthat's as significant as Petitioner suggests. If you\nlook at the record, in the pretrial testimony of\nOfficer Jones, he asked Ms. McCottry, upon arrival,\nrepeatedly did she know who this other person was, and\nher answer was she didn't know the person's last name.\nThe record isn't fully developed on that point, but it\nsounds like that -- that Mike was a friend of the\ndefendant's. And we know for sure that Mike left with\nthe defendant. I think it's reasonable to infer he\nalso came with the defendant, but we didn't have any\nparticular contact or handle on this person Mike.\nAnd in fact, if it was a friend of the\ndefendant, you'd think that the Compulsory Process\nClause would have given the defendant some basis on\nwhich to bring him before the court. I don't think\nthat that includes any of the -- that -- that doesn't\nsomehow shift the burden on the defendant in the same\nway it might if were to force him to bring the\ndeclarant in. If he knew Mike, he -- he certainly had\nthe ability to bring Mike in. So I don't think it's as\nsignificant as Petitioner suggests.\nYour Honor, I -- I do want to return for just\none moment to this notion that we don't want witnesses\nto testify and that we are satisfied with proceeding\njust on -- on the basis of other pieces of evidence.\nAt least in my practice and at least in our county,\nthat's definitely not true. In fact, even if we have a\nrecanting witness in, for example, the domestic\nviolence abuse scenario -- situation, it is often just\nas effective for us to go ahead and put -- put the\nwitness up on the stand, let her tell whatever story\nshe's presently telling, and then play the 911 -- 911\ntape also in conjunction with the testimony of the\nofficers who can describe what -- what condition she\nwas in when they arrived. And I think when you\njuxtapose the 911 tape, even with the recantation from\nthe witness, frankly sometimes the jurors find it even\nmore illuminating than -- than if she didn't appear.\nSo we do not spend our time trying to put together\ncases purposely without the victim testifying. It just\nso happens that sometimes, at the last minute like this\ncase, we're not able to bring the person in.\nBut I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How -- how often does this\nhappen? In other words, are we being asked to, in\neffect, on your part to -- to recognize or to derive a\nspecial rule for cases which, at least numerically, are\nsports?\nMR. WHISMAN: Your Honor, I do -- I cannot\nanswer in a percentage terms how often this happens.\nBut, you know, that you have a reluctant witness in\ndomestic violence cases is a -- is a not unusual\noccurrence in any event. But I don't think that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but I'm talking about\nthe witness who is not merely reluctant, but simply\ndoesn't show up and you make reasonable efforts and you\n-- and you can't find the witness. How often does that\nhappen?\nMR. WHISMAN: As I say, I'm -- I'm hard-\npressed to give a -- a percentage number. But it's\nnot, as I said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Has it happened to you\nbefore?\nMR. WHISMAN: I believe it has.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't know how many\ntimes.\nMR. WHISMAN: I can't say, no, Your Honor. I\ncan't say. I think it's maybe happened once to me, but\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So we're not -- I take it\nwe're not in a position whereby if we hold against you,\nwe are, in effect, nullifying the possibility of\nenforcing domestic violence laws by criminal process.\nMR. WHISMAN: Well, I -- I think the other\nfactor that has to be considered, Your Honor, is as soon\n-- as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring\nthe victim into not appearing will put an end to the\ncase, then it gives the defendant the increased\nincentive to put the pressure on the victim and cases\nthat otherwise would have pled won't. So I think it\nwill have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Disappearing. Not just not\nappearing. Disappearing.\nMR. WHISMAN: Yes. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. WHISMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA panic-stricken call for help, which can\noccur on a 911 call, is not a form of bearing witness\nwithin the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that\nactivates the rule in Crawford. Emergency statements,\nstatements that are made to 911 operators and to\nofficers at the scene investigating an urgent need to\nprotect a person's safety, do not resemble the classic\nforms of testimonial evidence that were generated under\nthe Marian statutes and the civil law practice that\nformed the impetus for the Confrontation Clause. In\nthree significant respects, statements that are made in\nemergency questioning differ from the kind of testimony\nthat prompted the rule in Crawford and the\nconfrontation right that it rests on.\nFirst of all, in the classic examples of\nsomeone giving testimony, which this Court noted means\na solemn declaration or affirmation for the purpose of\nproving a fact, people who are on 911 calls or seeking\nhelp at the scene of an -- an urgent situation are not\nmaking statements for the purpose of providing evidence\nin a case. They are making statements for the purpose\nof obtaining help, and that distinguishes them\nsignificantly from the kinds of subtle desires to shape\nand influence their statements that occur --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe. I mean,\nit's easy to imagine a 911 call that doesn't fit your\ndescription. You know, the person is trying to get in\nthe door. The call is -- you know, this is the fourth\ntime. I keep calling and I've talked to you about\nthis. You don't do anything. He's got to be locked up\nso this will stop. I mean, that's not -- that sounds\nmore like testimony than an immediate call for help.\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, we would\ndistinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where\nsomeone is seeking protection from an imminent or\npresent threat to their safety and a 911 call that's\nmaking a more generalized report of criminal activity\nor a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a\nnarrative form about the past.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the husband had left\nthe house here, as I understand it, when this -- when\nthis call occurred.\nMR. DREEBEN: Actually, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She -- she wanted the man\narrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?\nMR. DREEBEN: Actually, Justice Scalia, I\nbelieve when the call begins, the caller is speaking in\nthe present tense and says, he's here jumping on me\nagain. And the 911 operator then begins to elicit\ninformation to find out what is the level of the threat\nto her safety and what actions need to be taken and\nsays, okay, I've got help started. Help is on the way.\nNow, tell me what his name is, and she -- the -- the\ncaller tells what the name is of the defendant and, at\nthat point, says, he's running now. And so, it's only\nafter critical information is imparted at the beginning\nof the call that the caller says that he's leaving.\nBut even --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then what -- what's your\nposition if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's\nleft, and he's running down the block?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think in that situation,\nJustice Kennedy, there is still an imminent threatened\npotential of a recurrence. The person could come back.\nThere's no protection on the scene. The reason that\nshe's calling 911 and not a friend or -- or a health\ncare provider is that she believes she needs protection\nright then. And the -- the nature of an emergency is\nsuch that it exerts a pressure both on the person who\nis seeking help, as well as the official responder from\nthe government, to solve that urgent problem. Any\nevidentiary benefit that may come from that is really\nan incidental --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose\nit's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond\nnecklace and he's running -- and he's running away. We\nknow he's not going to come back.\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that situation would\nnot fall within the emergency rule that the Government\nis arguing for today. What we're arguing for is a rule\nthat deals when people's safety is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the -- the jewelry store\nowner who reports to the -- the police is fleeing on a\n911, that -- that's not -- that's not admissible under\nyour view?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I'm not saying that,\nJustice Kennedy. I'm saying that the Court isn't\nconfronted in this case with a situation in which\nthreats not to the person but to property or the need\nto obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are\npresent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what about\nthe -- my hypothetical?\nMR. DREEBEN: We would submit that that is\nnot testimonial within the meaning of Crawford for many\nof the same reasons that -- that are present in this\ncase. But it is a different case from this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by seeking\nhelp? I mean, it seems to me you're saying seeking\nhelp means trying to get somebody arrested, trying to\nget somebody who has harmed you arrested. In this\ncase, he was gone out of the house. She had gone and\nlocked the door before she came back to the phone and\ngave most of this testimony.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and in the -- in the\njeweler case, the guy is running down the street. What\nis the jeweler -- is the jeweler really worried about\nthe guy turning around and coming back to rob some\nmore? He wants the man arrested.\nMR. DREEBEN: The urgency certainly in -- in\nthe jewelry thief hypothetical does deal with\napprehending the person who has just stolen the goods.\nAnd that's why I say that it falls outside of the rule\nthat the Government is arguing for today.\nBut, Justice Scalia, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm concerned about the\nrule you're arguing today because it -- it seems to me\nthere's a good case for allowing the -- the statement\nby the jewelry store operator.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think there is a good --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and I want to know\nwhat your position is so that you don't come back next\nweek and say, well, now we want the jewelry store --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I'm not going to say that\nwe wouldn't, depending on how the Court analyzes this\ncase, argue for a submission that that's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We'd rather you analyze\nthe case now and then we'll analyze it later.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: What the Court needs to analyze\ntoday is whether an emergency statement where somebody\nis seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent\nrecurrence of the very violence that has triggered the\ncall is testimony. And it's not testimony because the\nsort of risks of government shaping and the declarant\nfocus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case\nare not present, and the information has, as Justice\nScalia pointed out, a unique probative value that's\nvery different from the kind of submission of an\naffidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that\nprompted the confrontation right.\nThe Framers were thinking about things that\nwe all would recognize as testimony, being deposed,\nsubmitting an affidavit, appearing before a -- a\nmagistrate in a pretrial proceeding, and they used the\nword witness in the Confrontation Clause not only to\nrefer to the kinds of statements that were covered, but\nin connection with knowledge that the same word appears\nin the Fifth Amendment and in the Sixth Amendment\nCompulsory Process Clause, where in all of those\ncontexts, its most natural application is to the formal\nacquisition of evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you say in that\nrespect about the blue brief's reference to 17th\ncentury cases, the hue and the cry where someone went\nout and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up,\nand that that evidence wasn't admissible?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think what's really\nstriking, Justice Breyer, is that there is no 17th\ncentury case law that reflects that. There's really a\nvirtual, complete absence on the other side of this\ncase of an affirmative argument supported by decided\ncases that says that evidence of that character was\neven known to the Framers, let alone excluded.\nIf you look closely at their constable cases,\nwhich is the closest cases that they -- they submit,\none of them is a report from the Old Bailey online\nsource which contains transcripts of criminal trials in\n-- in England, and one of them, the Radbourne case, is\nright around the time of the framing, and there's a\nlittle line in the transcript where the constable says,\nwell, I bent down and I asked the victim something and\nthen the judge says, well, don't say that. There's no\nevidence that that was regarded as a -- a legal ruling\nunder confrontation principles. There's no evidence\nthat the Framers were aware of the Radbourne Old\nBailey report, and there's additional statutory basis\nin the treason statute, which was applicable there,\nwhich said that all evidence had to be given face to\nface. So that's their primary authority.\nTheir next authority --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- it's -- it may\nbe not a lot, but it's something. You don't have\nanything to the contrary.\nMR. DREEBEN: What we have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have anything\nwhich shows that these hue and cry reports were\nadmitted, and there were a lot of them. They -- they\nwere done regularly.\nMR. DREEBEN: The hue and cry reports,\nJustice Scalia, as I think your earlier questioning\nsuggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of\nemergency situation what -- that we have here where a\nperson is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal\nact against them and seeking help. And the fact that\nwe have very little evidence at all of how 17th century\nBritish law handled this is really, I think, persuasive\nevidence that the Court should not deem the\nconfrontation right as a response to some sort of\nabuses in this area.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would say that a hue and\ncry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and\n-- and picking up the phone while the crime is in\nprogress. But I think it's quite similar to the -- the\njewelry hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you\nwhich you're unwilling to say is -- is not covered by\nthe -- is covered by the Confrontation Clause, and I\nthink it's quite similar to a woman, where the husband\nhas left and she's locked the door and she wants the\nhusband arrested. I think it's quite similar to that.\nBut for the telephone, it's -- it's someone who's been\nthe victim of a crime who goes to a public official, as\nsoon as possible, and says, I've been -- I've been\nsubject to a crime. I want to report the crime and\nhave the person arrested. I think it's very similar.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, first of all,\nthere is evidence that the hue and cry practice\nexisted. There is not evidence about how hue and cry\nreports were viewed as a matter of evidence law. It is\nvery difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century\nEnglish practice what we are dealing with now, in part\nbecause the system of public prosecutions that we have\ntoday where an official prosecutor representing the\nState carries the ball in a criminal case did not\nexist. The accuser had to appear in court as the\nprivate prosecutor. If the accuser did not appear,\nthere was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were\nsimply dismissed because there was no one official on\nthe scene to carry the ball. So the -- the speculation\nthat's required requires a number of inferential leaps\nthat Petitioners have to make in order to draw an\nanalogy.\nAnd at the same time, there really is an\nintuitive difference between the kinds of statements\nthat people make in emergencies and the kind of core\ntestimonial statements that we know prompted the\nconfrontation right, the Sir Walter Raleigh case\ninvolving affidavits and letters, the Marian practice\nunder which testimony was formally taken in the calm of\na magistrate's rooming house rather than in the\nimmediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually\nongoing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, you say\nfocus on the emergency nature. Very little of what\ntook place in the 911 call is emergency. He's beating\nme. He's jumping on me. Yes. What's his name? I\nmean, it's not like they'll send help if his name is\nJoe but they won't if it's Mike. It doesn't matter.\nWhich direction is he running? That's not related to\nthe emergency nature of the -- of the call.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is, Mr. Chief Justice, in\nthe sense that it's information that's needed to\nrespond to and resolve the imminent threat to this\nwoman's safety, which would certainly occur if the\nindividual decided to come back and finish what he'd\nstarted. And if a law enforcement authority set up its\n911 calls so as not to gather adequate information and\nthis individual had come back and actually beaten or\nkilled the victim, it would certainly be regarded as an\ninadequate response to the emergency situation of an\nongoing violent attack. And so for that reason, the\nrule that we're describing here for the Court would\ndeal with not only the present emergency but also its\nimminent, threatened recurrence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, rather than build that\ninto the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice\nKennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with,\nexplaining it. So what is your full explanation of the\ndiamond necklace?\nMR. DREEBEN: My -- my view on that is that\nthe kinds of statements that are made in the immediate\nreport of a crime are really in the form of excited\nutterances that are much different from the kind of\ndispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that\nprompted the confrontation right.\nNow, the Court could accept that line and say\nthat jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the\nmeaning of the Confrontation Clause, or it could\ndisagree and say that no, when there's not the\nimmediate threatened, imminent potential for a\nrecurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat\nthat as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat\nit as testimonial. Court could go either way on\nthat without touching the core of what's at issue\ntoday, which is namely emergency situations that pose a\nthreat to the safety of the person who's making the\ncall or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer\non the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't say that\nevery question asked in that context. Don't we have to\ndo it question by question? I mean, what if one of the\nquestions was, you know, has he beaten you before? How\nmany times before? You know, are you going to allow\nthat in too --\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- as an excited utterance?\nMR. DREEBEN: -- the more that the -- the\nquestioning begins to delve into a past narrative of\npast criminal activity, the more there is a reason to\nthink that it serves, in addition to its protection\npurpose, an evidentiary purpose.\nI'd hasten to add, Justice Scalia, that that\nkind of information is very important for the officers\nto know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get\nthe kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to\nrespond effectively. So it is reasonably necessary for\nthose kinds of questions and that information to be\nelicited.\nBut I also agree with Your Honor's suggestion\nthat not everything that occurs in a 911 call should be\nregarded as per se non-testimonial. Not everything\nthat happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded\nas per se non-testimonial. And naturally, the Court is\ngoing to have to apply a certain degree of analysis to\nthe actual questions and answers that are given. But\nif you look at the protocol in this case for the 911\ncall, if you look at the kinds of questions that were\nasked and the information that was given, it is all\nreasonably necessary to resolve an emergency by a\nperson who has really called in a state of extreme\nstress. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you.\nLet me say a word about the record and then\ntwo things about the emergency exception that we've\nbeen talking about.\nFirst, in the record it's always been\naccepted in this case that Mr. Davis had left the house\nwhen the 911 call started. In the joint appendix, page\n117, that's what the Washington Supreme Court said, and\nat page 30 of the evidentiary hearing in the trial\ncourt, the prosecutor submitted the case that way as\nwell.\nNow let me address the history here because\nit's important. And Justice Scalia is exactly right.\nThere's not a single case historically where a\nstatement to a law enforcement agent accusing someone\nof a crime was admitted in a criminal case. We're not\naware of one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That may be hearsay. That\nmay all be hearsay.\nMR. FISHER: It -- it is what it is, Justice\nBreyer. The -- the oldest case that is in the briefs\non the other side is White v. Illinois in 1992. So for\nsome 500 years before that. And -- and perhaps when we\nhave to draw an inference, we do have -- to a certain\ndegree we acknowledge the dog that doesn't bark. We\nhave evidence that was out there and simply wasn't\nused.\nLet's look at the history of the Marian\nstatutes. And I'm -- and I want to refer the Court\nspecifically to page 101 of Sir Matthew Hale's\ntreatise. He talks about the -- both the problem with\nthe hue and cry and then the reason we have the Marian\nstatutes. The reason we have the Marian statutes was\nbecause for pretrial bail and committal hearings, the\ncourts were not prepared to simply go on the initial\nreports. They wanted a formal examination of the\nwitness to use at even the pretrial hearing, to detain\nthe person pending trial. And Sir Matthew Hale at page\n101 says the problem with the fresh reports the hue\nand cry, is that -- is that they're not under oath.\nThey don't -- they don't even answer all the questions\nthat we would want answered.\nSo what the United States is asking you to\naccept is that the kind of evidence that the Framers\nwould not have even been prepared to allow at a\npretrial bail hearing -- rather, they wanted to have\nsomething more formal -- they would now accept to be\nused in the trial itself. And what we think is that\nthis turns everything on its head. The reason the\nMarian statutes were abused is because, of course, in\ncontinental Europe that was an accepted form of\nevidence, and so there was some reason to believe these\nformal statements could be used. No one ever suggested\nthe hue and cry could be used.\nFinally, let me say a word about police\nincentives. If you accept the rule that the -- that\nthe United States and -- and the State is asking you to\naccept, think about the incentives you put on 911\noperators. They're not supposed to ask too many\nquestions. They're not supposed to get too much\ninformation. The same would go for the responding\nofficer. They don't want to ask too many questions,\nstructured questions, make sure who did it, make sure\nthey have the details because then somehow these\nstatements become testimonial.\nWhat our rule says is it frees the 911\noperators, it frees the police officers to do what\nthey're supposed to do, which is immediately start\nresponding and both help people and start gathering\nevidence from the moment that a crime is reported. And\nthat's what we think the Confrontation Clause is all\nabout. It's not -- it's about the way the case is\nproved at trial. The Confrontation Clause -- as\nopposed to other emergency doctrines this Court has in\nthe Fourth Amendment area, for example, the\nConfrontation Clause has zero to say about the way\npolice officers do their jobs or the way the 911\noperators do their jobs. If they go out and collect\nstructured affidavits under oath, if the 911 operator\nput the caller under oath, there's nothing wrong with\nthat. If the 911 operator says, I want to be sure I\nhave this right, describe to me exactly what he looks\nlike, and tell me more about him, that's what we would\nwant somebody to do. And we shouldn't put a perverse\nincentive for these first responders that, all of a\nsudden, once they start gathering useful information\nfor the criminal justice system, that some sort of new\nrule triggers.\nAll we're saying is that these are the kinds\nof statements that were -- that the Framers would have\ncared about and that they did care about, and that\nnowadays if the State or other prosecutors want to use\nthem, they should be duty-bound to bring the witness\ninto court as well to submit the witness to cross\nexamination.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nsubmit the case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have one last question.\nHow do you think Professor Wigmore would have decided\nthis case?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: Well, this Court noticed that\nProfessor Wigmore had the view that the Confrontation\nClause applied only to witnesses that actually took the\nstand. So he would have thought the Confrontation\nClause didn't apply at all. But he would have\nacknowledged to you -- and this is interesting from his\ntreatise -- that these were testimonial statements. He\nsaid as soon as somebody starts -- as soon as in a\ncriminal trial we use a statement narrating a past\nevent, it's testimonial. However, Professor Wigmore\njust didn't quite have the Confrontation Clause right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
