PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb\nabusive private securities litigation. It took the\nextraordinary step of rejecting categorically the\ntraditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that\nare filed under the securities laws. Instead it\ndeclared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition,\n\"The complaint shall state with particularity facts\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant\nacted with the required state of mind.\"\nThe fundamental error in the court of\nappeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the\nstatute the strong inference language that Congress\nclearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but\nobviously applied rigorously.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At some point during your\nargument -- and I know you only have 20 minutes -- will\nyou tell me whether or not in your view the pleading\nstandard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is\nthe same as the instruction that's given to the jury?\nBecause if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument\nmay have some more force.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the answer to the\nquestion is that it does not have to be the same. I\nthink Congress actually has greater authority in dealing\nwith pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh\nAmendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that\nfar in this particular case because I think the\ninferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the\nrecord in this case would avoid any --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in writing -- I take\nit, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more\nlikely than not, preponderance of the evidence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's what the Court held --\nheld in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So your submission is,\nmaybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of\nthe case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must\nbasically apply a standard of fact -- standard of proof\nthat's higher than that what the jury would.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's important as a\nstandard of allegation, because what we're talking about\nhere is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers,\nand not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the\nplaintiffs. So I do think it's removed. I mean, this\nCourt has really never addressed the issue of the extent\nto which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings.\nAnd I don't think this is the case in which to take up\nthat issue because I think it is quite clear that what\nat least we're asking for as the appropriate\ninterpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to\napply -- that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto,\nand that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that\ninnocent explanations can be set aside. And if you take\nthat particular approach, which clearly is consistent\nwith the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you --\nthe Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is\neliminated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the Seventh\nAmendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the\nplaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line\nit's has the plaintiff proved a claim. But you're\nstating two different claims. The claim that must be\nstated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be\nproved, and I don't know of any other instance where\nthat is so.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there are\nany other instances in which that's true,\nJustice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a\nconstitutional problem. I think at the end of the day\nthe question is, does Congress have the power to enforce\nits view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter\nof policy at the pleadings stage, and I think the answer\nto that question is yes. But again, you don't have to\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't asking it as a\nmatter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do\nyou construe these words, what is it, \"strong\ninference?\" And the words come out of, as I understand\nit, a Second Circuit decision. So I would think the\nmost logical thing is that you'd look at the Second\nCircuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those\nwords from the Second Circuit decision, then we should\npick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied.\nBut your definition of strong inference is\nquite different from what the Second Circuit's was.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure that's 100\npercent true. I think the real problem with the Second\nCircuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule\nthat's out there. The Second Circuit applied a number\nof cases under its particularity standards under 9(b)\nprior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference\nstandard. Some of them -- I think we would be very\ncomfortable with the analysis in Shields versus\nCitytrust Bank, for instance. The way Judge Jacobs\nanalyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way\nwe're trying to analyze the complaint in this case. So\nif you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I ask\nthis question?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One of the amicus briefs\ntalks in terms of the percentages, how likely the\ninference, the word strong inference means 50 percent,\n30 percent, 60 percent. Do you think the inference has\nto be stronger or less strong than the inference of\nprobable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to\nget access to the privacy of a home and so forth?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it would have to be\nstronger than that, although I don't know how to\ntranslate that into percentages, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: A civil case would impose\na higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case\nthan they would for getting access to a citizen's\nprivate papers and the like?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the use of the\nlanguage \"strong inference\" carries with it a very\nsignificant burden that has to be demonstrated by the\nbuyer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A burden of over 50\npercent?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, to be sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In a criminal case, the\nperson seeking that action is a government officer who\npresumptively is not acting out of selfish motives,\nwhereas we're talking about private suits and some\nprivate litigants are selfish.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nAnd if you read the Securities Industries amicus brief,\nit ticks off all of the instances of harm that are\ncaused by allowing -- too much of the private litigation\nis precisely that, which Congress was responding to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just have to make it\nclear. Is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is\ngreater than more likely than not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I believe Congress\nwould have intended it to be more --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the -- doesn't the\nstandard at the pleading stage have to be the same as\nthe standard at the summary judgment stage? If --\nsuppose that a certain set of facts is sufficient to\ndefeat summary judgment. If the plaintiff alleges all\nof those facts in the complaint, are you saying that\nthat complaint could be dismissed even though supporting\nthose facts at the summary judgment stage would be\nenough to defeat a summary judgment motion?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think at the end of the day\nI would make that argument. I don't have to make that\nargument here because it's clear to me that the same\nstandards of Matushita and Monsanto that say you have to\nexclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary\njudgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading\nstage, so there is no disconnect.\nBut if I were actually forced into that\nposition, I think I would take that view, although I\nprobably would argue first that the standard of\nHuddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than\nrejecting clearly what Congress had in mind in 1995 when\nit acted to curb the abuses of private securities\nlitigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the difference\nbetween Matsushita and this particular case at least as\nyou are presenting this case, the -- the -- focused on\nthe strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct?\nAs, as I recall Matsushita, there -- there\nhad to be at that stage, there had to be evidence from\nwhich one could infer that the -- that the conduct was\nnot innocent; but you're arguing for something stronger\nthan that. You're arguing for, in effect, an -- an\nultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct. And\naren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did\nat -- at that later stage?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think there may be a slight\nsemantic difference there, but the truth is at end of\nthe day all we're asking for the Court to do is to\nevaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the\nnegative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities,\ninterpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you\ntraditionally do, take into account whether there is an\nallegation of motive, and say at the end of the day\nwhether or not that reaches a -- rises to the level of a\nstrong inference.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but Matsushita as I\nrecall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a\nplausible inference. And I think you're arguing for\nsomething stronger than that. And I think the language\nof Congress forces you to do it but I -- I'm just\nfinding it difficult to conclude -- to equate the\nplausibility standard in, in Matsushita with the strong\ninference standard here. If you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if I'm going to err on\neither side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries\nout Congress's intent. We thing you needn't go any\nfurther than Matsushita did in order to reverse the\ncourt of appeals in this particular case.\nObviously there is probably some potential\ndistance between the two, where you could certainly\ninterpret the strong inference standard more in the line\nthe way the United States interprets it, as creating a\nhigh likelihood of scienter. And we don't -- we're\ncertainly not objecting to that. We're just saying to\nthe Court that you needn't go that far in order to\ndecide this case, although obviously we would welcome a\nruling along those lines if the Court's inclined to go\nthat far.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it fair to say at the\npleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and\nconvincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it\nwould only be more probable than not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, I think it -- I\nthink it puts an issue -- and we raised this in our\nreply brief, whether or not Huddleston should be\nreconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in\nthe way Congress is approaching private securities\nlitigation. But, so my --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you do --\nMR. PHILLIPS: There are a number of ways to\ngo at it. But if it turned out to be a disconnect, that\nwould not offend at least my sense of what Congress was\ntrying to achieve here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. Well, I don't think\nCongress was trying to achieve an alteration in the\nultimate standard, either, in the jury standard. What\nit was concerned with is the enormous expense of -- of\ndiscovery. And, and tried to set a high wall to get to\nthe discovery stage. I don't know why that should have\nto affect or should logically affect the standard that\nthe jury is told to use.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All I'm suggesting is that if\nthe Court were concerned that somehow there is a\ndisconnect between the pleading standard and the\nultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that\nincongruity -- if it is one -- would to be reconsider\nthe ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the\nclearly congressionally approved baby as part of that\nbath water.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me a little\nbit of how -- how this should work in your view? Assume\nthe CEO makes misstatements as to the earnings report\nand the acceptance of one of its new products. Just\nassume that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we make a strong\ninference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports\nare?\nMR. PHILLIPS: You mean with a specific\nearnings report rather than just simply sort of sales\nprojections and demand?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we make a strong\ninference that a CEO knows the status of current\nearnings --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, my guess is they --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when he makes, when he\nmakes a statement.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think they would have\nto make an allegation that the -- that the CEO routinely\nis provided with that information rather than simply\nassume it. I think it's the same problem you have with\ntheir -- with their allegation that it's common sense\nthat CEOs will act to protect their own personal self\ninterest and the overall welfare of the company by\nmisrepresenting the status of events.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about just saying that\nhe knew it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just saying that he knew\nit. Without saying why they knew that he knew it?\nYou're saying they have to give a reason why they knew\nthat he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports?\nSuppose they didn't say that. They just said knowing\nthat the -- that the figures were otherwise, he -- he\nset them forth.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think that's\nsufficient, because it requires for the facts that\nparticularly show --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose it says, which\nI think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed\non top of the company's financial health by having\nweekly conversations with other executives. He had his\nhands on the pulse of the company. He saw weekly sales\nreports and product -- projection -- production\nprojections. Now it seems like an allegation that's\nvery specific.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the -- but the problem\nwith that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500,\nthe Titan 6500 product specifically, in that context,\nthe report is, there's nothing in there that says what\nthose reports say about the 6500. And remember, this is\na case where the plaintiffs have 27 whistleblowers\ninside the company who could provide you with all of the\ndetail in the world; and yet when it comes time to tell\nyou what was in the 6500 report that would -- that would\nsuggest that it's not available, there's not word one in\nthe allegation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought they\nalleged at least that for about a year previously in\nrespect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout\nthe company that the 6500 had been delayed. Don't they\nmake an allegation like that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right but that's -- that\nbeing delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim.\nThe question was is the, is the 6500 being sold; and\nthat was the allegation. And the answer to that is he\n-- I -- he had every reason to believe that, based on\nwhat they've claimed because they've not produced a\nreport or said that there's anything inside the report\nthat says to the contrary about that.\nAgain, it seems to me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The 6500 has long been\ndelayed. Everyone knows that in the company. So he\nknows it's long been delayed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then what he says is it is\nbeing shipped and delivered. Something like that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Breyer, that --\nthat long been delayed period runs all the way back to\n1998. And we're talking about events in 2000 and 2001.\nSo the notion that it's been long delayed says nothing\nabout what Mr. Notebaert was -- was revealing in March\nand April and June of 2001.\nIt, it could potentially, but it equally, it\ncouldn't. It's the same problem you get with the 5500,\nwhere the court of appeals specifically said it is quite\nplausible that Mr. Notebaert never saw those reports.\nNow how you can make that concession and\nnevertheless say there is a strong inference that he\nacted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: April '01, he says\neverything we can build we are building, and shipping.\nThe demand is very strong. And then what they say is of\ncourse nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and\nthey've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on\nthe pulse of the company.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But you -- you --\nJustice Breyer, you make a leap there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Yeah.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Is that they all knew that.\nThe point is they knew that it was delayed back in 1999.\nWhat they don't do is tie that in to what he knew in\n2001; and that, to me, that's the central point in this\ncase, is do you require that kind of specificity? And\nit seems to me there's no other way to read what\nCongress says in this statute than to that. I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMr. Phillips.\nMr. Shanmugam.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAN,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWhile meritorious private actions are an\nessential supplement to Government enforcement of the\nsecurities laws, abusive action impose substantial costs\non companies and their shareholders. As a cornerstone\nof its effort in the Reform Act to address the problem\nof abusive actions, Congress adopted uniform and more\nstringent pleading requirements including the strong\ninference requirement at issue in this case.\nThe court of appeals erred by holding that a\nplaintiff can satisfy that requirement simply by\nalleging facts which an inference of state of mind could\nbe drawn. The court of appeals thereby misinterpreted\nthe Reform Act. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a\nposition on Justice Alito's earlier question about\nwhether the standard at the summary judgment stage is\nthe same as the standard at the pleading stage?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: First of all to be clear,\nMr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that the Court needs\nto address that question in this case, because we don't\nbelieve that that sort of disparity would present any\nSeventh Amendment concerns. However, if the Court does\nbelieve that any disparity in the degree of probability\nrequired does present Seventh Amendment concerns, we\nbelieve that it is more consistent with Congress's\nintent to apply the strong inference requirement at the\nproof stage as well as the pleading stage rather than to\nwater down the strong inference requirement that\nCongress adopted at the pleading stage.\nAnd we believe that that requirement does\nimpose a very high burden. In our view, it requires a\nplaintiff to allege facts that give rise to a high\nlikelihood that the conclusion that the defendant acted\nwith the necessary date of mind follows from those\nallegations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And by the proof stage you\nmean both summary judgment and submission to jury?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think that that is right,\nJustice Kennedy. I suppose that if the perceived\nconstitutional concern is solely regarding the degree of\nlikelihood that is required, it could be applied simply\nat the summary judgment stage; but to the extent that\nthe Court believes that it is a matter for the jury to\ndetermine whether a given set of facts gives rise to an\ninference of the requisite strength then yes, the jury\nwould need to be instructed in a manner consistent with\nthe strong --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you think about\nthe following --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just -- may I just,\nvery briefly. . Putting aside the constitutional\nproblem, do you think the standards are the same or\ndifferent between the pleading stage and the\nconstitutional stage -- and the summary judgment stage?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, we don't\nbelieve that the Court needs to address that question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. That's\nnot my question.\nMR. SHANMUGAN: And the statute by its terms\nonly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is either a yes or no\nquestion.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that the\nanswer is yes if the Court feels it needs to address\nthat question. And to be sure, the strong inference\nstandard that Congress adopted was framed only in terms\nof the pleading stage. And our view --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there was a pleading\nstage, I would like your clear view on how much that\nchanges. It has been the understanding that when there\nis a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the\ncomplaint and you construe the allegations in that\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\nIs that rule not applied under the\ninterpretation you are giving us of strong inference?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think that it is,\nJustice Ginsburg, to this limited extent. In an\nordinary civil case, the case is governed of course by\nRule 8. And in some sense the rule that the allegations\nin the complaint must be construed in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff is really derived from Rule 8\nand its requirement that a plaintiff need only provide a\nshortened claim statement of the relevant underlying\nfacts in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\nWhat Congress did in the Reform Act was to\nrequire first of all some degree of particularity in\nallegation; but Congress went further than that; and to\nthe extent that Congress spoke in terms of the\ninferences that can be drawn from those allegations, we\ndo believe that Congress abrogated the background rule\nthat the allegations must be read in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, or as some courts have put\nit, that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn\nfrom the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiff's\nfavor.\nThat clearly is a change on the preexisting\nlaw; and it is a change with regard to the law that\ncircuits were applying before the enactment of the\nReform Act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't we simply assume\nthat the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is\nstill in place, but that reading it most favorably to\nthe plaintiff, it must rise to the level of supporting\nthe strong inference?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I guess, Justice Souter,\nthat I would wonder what it would mean to say that you\nread the allegations in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiff. If what it means is that a plaintiff can\nsimply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in\norder to create the strong inference of state of mind\nthat is ultimately required, then I think I would\ndisagree that that rule remains in effect. Precisely\nbecause our view is that in applying the strong\ninference standard, a court should consider other\npossible explanations for the defendant's conduct that\nare not foreclosed by the allegations --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I was using the\nword inference to -- to refer to some reasoning process\nbased upon what is stated. Not on assumptions favorable\nto the plaintiff.\nAnd if inference is to tie -- is, is a term\nthat is tied to what is alleged, then I don't see any --\nany contradiction between reading those allegations most\nfavorably, but saying the statute in each statute\nrequires that the -- that the total force of the\ninference rise to the level of strength that you speak\nof.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think our only concern,\nJustice Souter, would be that where a plaintiff includes\nambiguous allegations in the complaint, a court should\nconsider the possibility that those ambiguities work to\nthe defendant's favor as well as working to the\nplaintiff's favor. And one concrete example of that in\nthis case are the allegations that concern the Titan\n5500. There are allegations in this case that there was\na study and there were various internal reports that\nindicated that demand for that product was declining.\nBut the complaint does not specifically\nallege that that study and those internal reports were\neven available at the time the CEO made the alleged --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, could --\ncould I get you back to -- to your, your assertion of we\ndon't have to reach in this case the question of whether\nthe same standard applies at trial as, as at the\npleading stage?\nIt seems to me a Seventh Amendment claim has\nbeen raised. It's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary\nconstitutional adjudication. If indeed the two\nstandards are the same, there's certainly no Seventh\nAmendment problem. So why don't we have to first of all\ndecide, in resolving the Seventh Amendment claim,\nwhether the two standards are the same?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is certainly\ncorrect, Justice Scalia, but in our view, there is no\nconstitutional problem here. And the reason that there\nis no constitutional problem here is in making the\nprobabilistic determination that is required by the\nReform Act, a court is taking the allegations in the\ncomplaint as true. It is not engaging in any weighing\nof the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're getting to the\nmerits of the constitutional problem. And we usually\nrun away from constitutional problems. We don't even\nwant to consider the merits of it. And we don't have\nto, if indeed the two standards are the same.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, to the extent that the\nCourt views the constitutional issue in this case as\nsufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance, then we do believe that the\nbetter view, the view that is more consistent with\nCongress's intent, is that if the Court is choosing\nbetween raising the standard at the pre stage and\nwatering down the standard at the pleadings stage, we\nbelieve that the former is more consistent with\nCongress's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if there is no Seventh\nAmendment problem, what sense would it make to have a\nregime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the\nplaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at\ntrial.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Congress was\nconcerned, Justice Alito, with the problem of abusive\npleading. That much is crystal clear. And as part of\nthat concern, Congress was concerned that plaintiffs\ncould readily allege fraud by hindsight, and Congress\nmay have been concerned that the plaintiff could do so\nnot only by making a conclusory allegation of state of\nmind, but also making a slightly less conclusory\nallegation of state of mind by alleging facts that\nmerely give rise to a reasonable inference of state of\nmind.\nIf Congress hadn't had that concern, it\nobviously could have codified the reasonable inference\nstandard that was then in use by a number of other\ncourts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think in\nwriting this opinion? There are a couple of ways. One,\nyou can find strong inference in terms of some other\nwords. Two, you could look to history. Or three, you\ncould just try an example. Say strong inference means\nstrong inference. Here's an example. This is a\ncomplaint. It meets it, or it doesn't meet it. Which\nway, in your opinion, will work best in this case?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Breyer, our primary\nconcern in this case is with the way that the Court of\nAppeals articulated the applicable standard, which we\nbelieve may have pernicious effects in future cases.\nAnd so we certainly believe that it would be appropriate\nfor the Court to vacate and remand for the Court of\nAppeals to apply the correct standard. But just to be\nclear --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said the Court of\nAppeals to apply it. Could the Court of Appeals\napplying the standard that you say is correct come to\nthe same decision that it came to using a different\nverbal formula.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: In our view,\nJustice Ginsburg, applying the correct standard, the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be\nreversed. And if the case were remanded to the Court of\nAppeals for application of the standard, we certainly\nthink that the Court of Appeals should come out the\nother way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You had something else to\nsay in answer to my question, which I would like to\nhear.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think it was just that\npoint, Justice Breyer, namely, that if the Court\nbelieves that it would be useful to provide guidance to\nthe lower courts by applying the standard itself in this\ncase, we do believe that the decision of the Court of\nAppeals should be reversed rather than vacated.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the requisite standard,\nknowledge of falsity.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The requisite scienter is\neither intent or recklessness, with regard to the\nunderlying conduct at issue, in effect --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Intent to make a false\nstatement?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's right. And in\nfact, in misstatement cases, that is knowledge of\nfalsity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMr. Shanmugam.\nMr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR R. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court?\nWe believe the Seventh Circuit had it right.\nWe believe that what the Seventh Circuit, and this is in\npartial response to you, Justice Breyer, is take more or\nless a holistic view of the entirety of the complaint.\nThe business about the 5500, the business about the 6500\nnot being available when on December 11, 2000, Notebaert\nsays it's available, the fact that they weren't shipping\nit, they weren't selling it, it didn't work, and the\nextensive information from confidential sources that\nthere were, as one judge once referred to it, accounting\nshenanigans going on, designed to shift income into the\nfourth quarter of 2000.\nWe think that when the court looked at that,\nit said, looks to us as if there's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take judicial notice\nthat a CEO knows these things and that's the strong\ninference.\nMR. MILLER: Again, you have confidential\nsources in this case, and in the case, Notebaert is\nhands on, he's talking to people, he's on the phone all\nthe time. We're talking about the 5500 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you agree you have to\nhave that? You have to have some specific allegation to\nshow of his knowledge? We can't just infer that?\nMR. MILLER: I would think you should be\nable to infer it with the CEO. I think the confidential\nsources demonstrate in this case, he must have had it,\ngiven his nature, the status of these products, his\nday-to-day --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The most suspicious thing\nin the complaint that I could find was where you say\nthere's an internal market report, and it revealed\ndemand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would\ndecline by 400,000,000. Then you date that with in or\nabout early '01. Now, I think if you knew or had reason\nto believe that it was prior to March or April of '01,\nyou would have said so.\nMR. MILLER: If we knew.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, and therefore,\nthere's quite a good chance here that this report was\nwritten after he made the statements.\nWhat am I supposed to do with that? I mean,\nI know what you said. And you said your best. And\nthat's your best.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. This notion of strategic\nambiguity is in a sense humorous, given the obstacles\nthat a plaintiff has to get the goods, so to speak.\nJust think about the investigation efforts that went\ninto this case. What you do, Justice Breyer, is -- and\nI think this is what the Seventh Circuit did -- look at\neverything, look at the fact that you have got\nconfidential sources saying 5500 demand is drying up,\nperhaps as early as middle 2000. Parts are not being\nordered. People are going home early. Verizon dropped\n25 percent, fourth quarter. Verizon dropped 50 percent\nin January.\nYou're the CEO. You don't know that your\nflagship product is drying up? That there's inventory,\nthat people are going home? That your best customer\ndoesn't know you anymore?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're arguing the\nfacts and the inferences. You said the Seventh Circuit\ngot it right. As I read their articulation of the\nstandard on page 20A of the petition appendix, it's the\nnormal standard that would have been applied prior to\nthe passage of the PSLRA. Could a reasonable person\ninfer -- Congress passes a law saying they've got to\ngive rise to a strong inference. Shouldn't that have\nchanged the standard?\nMR. MILLER: We believe two propositions.\nNumber one, you can't exceed the Seventh Amendment, and\nthe Seventh Circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nthe Seventh Amendment argument here. Congress can\nsurely articulate the standard that's going to be\napplied as a matter of substantive law. If Congress\nsays, you have to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh\nAmendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to\nthat standard.\nMR. MILLER: That is correct, Chief Justice.\nBut that is not what Congress did. Congress did not\nelevate the burden of proof. That is why Mr. Phillips\nhas asked you to, in effect, to overrule Huddleston.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but Congress just\nestablished an entry qualification for getting into\ncourt.\nAnd there are a lot of entry qualifications.\nIn diversity cases, you -- if you allege diversity, and\nit existed at the outset, that's fine. That doesn't\nhave to be proved at the end of the case. Indeed even\nif you prove the contrary, the case is still validly\nthere. Congress can establish entry requirements even\nwhen they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with\nthe merits that the jury is supposed to decide.\nMR. MILLER: I think that is absolutely\ncorrect, and indeed rule 9(b) has been an entry\nqualification since 1938. But there are entry\nqualifications, and there are entry qualifications.\nIn this case, in effect, the motion to\ndismiss operates as a dispositive motion. It cuts off\nthe ability to proceed at all, and it does it, if you\nlisten to the standards being proposed by Petitioner,\nand by the United States --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference\nbetween what Justice Scalia was just saying? You can't\ncome into Federal court unless you have at least\n$200,000 damages. Now, you might have been just as much\nhurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional.\nSo here you can't get into Federal court unless you have\na really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you\nhave to demonstrate at the beginning.\nNow, you might have a good claim, but we're\nnot going to let you come into Federal court. We only\nwant those people who are really strong, just as we only\nwant those people who are really suffering.\nMR. MILLER: And did Congress raise the\nburden --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No, not the burden\nof -- it's the entry.\nMR. MILLER: The entry points you referred\nto, the so-called pleas in abatement, to put on my\ncommon law hat, a jurisdiction venue, et cetera, they\nmay raise issues of fact and Congress, in control of the\nFederal courts, can calibrate it any way they want.\nBut when you are dealing with the core\nfunction of the jury -- and matters of abatement were\nnever considered to be core functions of the jury -- I\nthink a whole range of cases starting with Slocum versus\nNew York Life --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you told\nme that Congress could set a high level of burden on\nfactual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the\nSeventh Amendment.\nMR. MILLER: I'm distinguishing, Mr. Chief\nJustice, between the merits and the entry point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you saying that\nCongress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is\ndifferent than preponderance of the evidence.\nMR. MILLER: No. No. No. No. If Congress\nwants to change preponderance to clear and convincing,\nit can.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you would say that you\ncould have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must\nbe met at the pleading level, but more likely than not\nat the jury level?\nMR. MILLER: No. That is something I\ndisagree with. If the substance of the law --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We want to know what the\nrule is.\nMR. MILLER: I'm not sure it's the rule.\nIt's what I would advocate. If the substance says\npredominance, then to raise the pleading bar on what in\neffect is a dispositive motion -- and I don't think it\nmakes any difference whether it's a JNOV, a directed\nverdict, a summary judgment, motion for judgment on the\nopening statement -- and you decided all of those cases.\nAnd you protected what Justice Souter referred to in\nMarkman as the core function of the jury. You have\nalways said these procedures are okay, as long as it\ndoes not call for the resolution of fact issues, because\nthat's the core function of the jury.\nNow this Court is faced with, in effect,\ncoming back down that time line to the motion to\ndismiss.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I'm with you so\nfar, why would you suppose that Congress would create a\ndifferent standard on the motion to dismiss than they\nmeant to apply at the merits standard?\nMR. MILLER: I don't think Congress would.\nI do not believe Congress ever intended -- it's not in\nthe statute, it is not in the legislative history, it is\nnot in any case, Matsushita, Monsanto are unique\nantitrust cases, and in both cases, the Court, if you\nread the opinions fully, protected the jury function.\nThey said there was simply nothing beyond the assertions\nstanding alone when you have competitive and\nanticompetitive conduct to protect substantive antitrust\nlaw. That doesn't do it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then what was\nCongress trying to do when they said strong inference?\nIt seems to me that if you think the standards have to\nbe the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says\nstrong inference at pleading, it means you have to show\na strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no\nSeventh Amendment problem.\nMR. MILLER: What you have to show at proof\nis preponderance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that\nyou have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable\ninference.\nMR. MILLER: Our standard, as proposed, and\nwe think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't want to answer\nyes or no there?\nMR. MILLER: -- is reasonable jurors, who\nare finders of fact, could find by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that the defendants acted with scienter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying those\nwords, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing\nas reasonable inference.\nMR. MILLER: No. You can have lots of\nreasonable inferences that don't meet a preponderance\nnotion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but imagine a\ncase where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets\nforth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on\nboth sides.\nAnd then you read that document and you\nconclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I\ndo think a reasonable juror could find for the\nplaintiff.\nAnd that would be the weak evidence\nstandard.\nAnd lo and behold, that could be -- you\nknow, what do we do about that? Because using your do\nyou send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine\ncases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the\nweak inference and not the strong inference. And what\nI'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this\nSeventh Amendment problem.\nMR. MILLER: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because they certainly\ndidn't intend the weak inference standard.\nMR. MILLER: If you follow petitioners in\ntheir attempt to deconstruct not simply Rule 8's\nconstruction, but hundreds of years of what this Court\nin Jones versus Bock referred to as usual procedural\npractices which are not to be lightly departed from, the\nhistoric notion is you look at the complaint and in a\ncurious way, you have blinders on. You look at the\ncomplaint. You read it in the light favorable to the\npleader. You do not weigh. That is a jury function.\nYou do not look for exculpatory explanations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can you assess the\nstrength of the inference that can be drawn from the\nfacts alleged in the complaint without considering all\nthe inferences that could be drawn from those facts? I\njust don't understand that argument.\nYou see somebody -- let's say you saw\nsomebody today walking east on Pennsylvania Avenue in\nthe direction of Capitol Hill. Now you -- there's --\nyou could draw an inference that the person is coming to\nthe Supreme Court. And if there were no other building\nin Washington, that would be a very strong inference.\nBut don't you also have to consider the inference that\nthe person is going to the Capitol, the person is going\nto the Library of Congress, the person is going to some\nother location up here? You have to consider all the\ninferences that you can draw from the facts.\nMR. MILLER: As the Seventh Circuit did, we\nagree, you look at the totality of the complaint.\nThat's a given.\nBut there are contrary inferences that\nundermine the strength of the plaintiff's inferences.\nThey weaken it. And they're -- they emanate from the\ncomplaint.\nThere are other kinds of inferences, let's\ncall it nonculpability, that don't denigrate the strong\ninference which let's assume hypothetically has been\nestablished. They're just side-bar possibilities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take one\nspecific example that the petitioners did, and that is\nthis matter of the channel stuffing. They say here's a\nnotion, channel stuffing. It could mean goods were\nshipped that nobody ever ordered, or it could mean\nsomething different. It could mean discounting and\nother incentives to get people to buy. So there's good\nchannel stuffing and bad channel stuffing, and it sounds\nlike good cholesterol, bad cholesterol; you can't tell\nfrom the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's\nat issue.\nMR. MILLER: The Seventh Circuit reached\nthat conclusion, I think, by looking at some of the\nconfidential sources which sort of indicated that there\nwas channel stuffing in the sense of pushing product out\nwhich was coming back. The head of Verizon complained\nabout the channel stuffing, so there's reason to believe\nthat at least some of it is bad. Just enough.\nNow, is that in and of itself determinative?\nNo. Again, I come back to the notion that what the\nSeventh Circuit did is look at the 5500, look at the\n6500, look at the earnings projections which proved\nfalse, looked at back-dating, channel stuffing. Looked\nat all of that and said okay, even if I treat channel\nstuffing as weak, I have these other things. And as\nJudge Lynch of the First Circuit said, each fact of\nscienter is like a brush stroke.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you entitled to\nconsider the brush strokes that are not there as well as\nthe subsidiary brush strokes that are? In\nJustice Alito's example, if the pleadings don't point\nout that the Library of Congress and the Capitol are\nalso up on this hill, is the judge at the motions stage\nentitled to consider that?\nMR. MILLER: Obviously, if it's something\nyou can take judicial notice of, then yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Then that is\nengaging in something more than construing the pleadings\nmost favorably to the plaintiff.\nMR. MILLER: But it's within the realm of\nwhat courts have done for the longest of the time. They\nlook at documents attached. They look at judicial\nnotice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you think about\nthat? There are at least some circumstances, then, in\nwhich there this is kind of critical assessment function\nthat you concede must go on, rather than simply a piling\nfavorable inference onto favorable inference to see if\nit gets to the strong points.\nMR. MILLER: I repeat what I said a couple\nof minutes ago, Justice Souter. If the negative\ndepletes the affirmative, if there's a correlation\nbetween them, I can understand that. Maybe it\neliminates that fact. Maybe it reduces that fact.\nBut when we hear about motive, what does\nmotive and guidance reduction months after the false\nstatements have to do with whether the statements were\nfalse, whether the 5500 was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is -- that is an\nargument for the weight of considering motive rather\nthan the relevance of the motive consideration per se.\nMR. MILLER: I think it is a tough line. I\nthink this is the kind of line district judges have to\ndraw. I think if you look at your own precedents like\nAnderson versus Liberty Lobby and all of those jury\ntrial cases, you see the repetition of the notion that\njudges do not balance inference chains on a matter going\nto the core function of a jury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But all of those\ncases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to\nme, established a very different standard. They said\nthey have to support a strong inference.\nMR. MILLER: A strong inference. Not a\nconclusive inference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Strong inference was\nnot the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty\nLobby, in any of those cases.\nMR. MILLER: But can't -- but strong\ninference, as Justice Ginsburg said much earlier, was\nthe standard not only in the Second Circuit but in the\nFirst Circuit and in the Third Circuit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about the\napproach -- because I have had some of these cases. And\nI see -- I think words, words, words.\nAnd what Congress said was strong inference,\nand we're not going to get any further by looking for\nsome other words. So therefore, take strong inference.\nThe most helpful thing is take it, look at the\ncomplaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong\ninference. Or maybe we'd say it isn't. We read it, and\navoid all the other issues. What do you think about\nthat?\nMR. MILLER: Live to fight another day?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And then on appeal,\nwe would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes,\nit is a strong inference.\nI mean, I hope we're going to establish some\nstandards for how you go about determining whether\nthere's a strong inference or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I hope we're going to\nrecognize that Congress thought it was doing something.\nYour argument so far, Professor, doesn't indicate\nthat Congress --\nMR. MILLER: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You indicated that the --\nyou know, the plaintiff had to do all this\ninvestigation. The whole point of this was that the\ndefendants were being disadvantaged.\nMR. MILLER: Look at the statute in its\nentirety. This isn't a statute that just deals with\npleading scienter. Look at the provisions dealing with\nthe selection of lead representative, which has produced\nthis incredible shift from '95 to public institutions,\npensions and labor unions. They don't bring frivolous\ncases. Look at the control that statute gives over\nselection of them with notice provisions to make sure\nyou've got the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does that change\nhow we should read strong inference in the statute? Are\nyou saying don't worry whether it's a strong inference\nor not because labor unions are bringing the cases and\nthey're not going to bring a frivolous case? No.\nCongress said there has to be a strong inference. And\nwhat concerns me is that the very standard that the\nSeventh Circuit articulated said simply could a\nreasonable person infer. The notion of strong inference\nisn't in that standard at all.\nMR. MILLER: The notion of strong inference\nstarting with the Second Circuit doctrine, as used in\nmany other circuits, was actually a much lower standard\nthan what we are recommending.\nIf I believe -- if I think back at\nGreenstone, it was reason to believe, or tends to\nbelieve, or circumstantial evidence in Greenstone and in\nBurlington Coat.\nUnder our standard of preponderance, the\nability to find preponderance, you are elevated. You\nare also elevated by the preceding subdivision which\nrequires a level of particularization, never known in\nFederal Rule --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Miller, going back\njust to the word strong, forgetting the\nparticularization from it, do you think you can\ncategorize the strength in percentage terms? They have\nto be more than 50 percent? More than probable cause?\nWe're talking all abstractly here and I find\nit easier to think when I think about numbers.\nMR. MILLER: I have -- forgive me. I\nhaven't seen a judicial opinion that says at the 33 and\none-third percentage of probability, I've got to give it\nto the jury, because that jury might file for my --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's 66 and\ntwo-thirds. I think that is --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Is that because you never met a\nplaintiff you really liked?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At least we know that in\nthe probable world --\nMR. MILLER: I took a liberty there with the\nJustice. I don't think you can ascribe a percentage to\nit. I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think more likely\nthan not, most people think of 49, 50 percent. Can you\ntell us whether strong inference is stronger than more\nlikely than not?\nMR. MILLER: I do not believe it is. I\nthink --\nI think strong inference -- if we're doing\nthe numbers game -- may actually be 40 percent. If a\ndistrict judge is looking, again, I say at the entirety\nof discounts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just reclaim the\nquestion. Is it stronger or weaker than probable cause\nin a criminal context?\nMR. MILLER: Oh, I would hope it's stronger.\nI would hope it's higher than probable cause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about clear and\nconvincing? Is it below clear -- I mean, they are the\nonly two standards I actually understand. Without\npicking a number out of air, is preponderance, I think I\ncan figure that out. And I guess I can figure out\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. But other than those, when\nyou talking about strong, when you talk about clear and\nconvincing, I have no idea what those things mean.\nDo you?\nMR. MILLER: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think they mean\nanything?\nMR. MILLER: No, I think they mean what a\ndistrict judge honoring his Article III commission\nconcludes after an intensive evaluation of the entirety\nof the complaint, looking for that strong inference,\nputting on his sort of motion to dismiss 12(b)(6) hat,\nsays okay --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just okay?\nMR. MILLER: No, I did not mean that. Don't\ntake me literally on that. For heavens sakes, I'm from\nBrooklyn. I'm very colloquial. I'm very sorry about\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me write that down. We\nshould not take you literally. All right.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, you two are\neven now.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Understand, you keep asking,\nquite properly obviously, how does strong inference\nchange anything?\nThe test we have proposed and the test I\nbelieve the Seventh Circuit applied is not the classic\n12(b)(6) have you stated a claim, because we all know at\nleast traditionally, under notice pleading, you can\nmarch through that.\nThis test, if you follow that time line\nbackward, is in effect asking that district judge to\nmake a decision on looking at the totality of this\ncomplaint, is this case trial worthy? It's a curious\nthing. I don't envy district judges who have to do\nthis.\nIs it trial worthy? Why would Congress say,\nif a district judge is willing to say under the classic\ntest, I think it's trial worthy, there's no reason to\nbelieve that Congress wanted to cut that case off.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Trial worthy under\npreponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong\ninference standard?\nMR. MILLER: Oh, I think he is becoming\nslightly schizoid, he is saying, I'm looking at strong\ninference. I'm looking at the motion to dismiss\nstructure as it's been, the usual procedure, 200 years,\nand I have to make a judgment because Congress was\npushing here. There's no doubt about it.\nI have to make a decision on the basis of\nwhat I've got, which is virtually nothing -- let's face\nthat -- I think -- I think if these allegations are\nproven, it is certainly trial worthy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It sounds to me like --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not trial worthy, but\nrather discovery worthy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.\nJustice Stevens, say it again.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think the question is\nnot whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy\nfor discovery. That's really what's at issue in this.\nMR. MILLER: Well, the realities out there\nare they built a wall. They put in all of these\nprocedural protections and they said no discovery until\nyou climb the wall. Now what kind of a wall was it?\nWas it a Dutch dike or the Berlin Wall? If you look at\nthat statute, contrary to what Mr. Phillips urges, there\nare multiple policies expressed in that statute, one of\nwhich is, private cases are good. Let's just get the\nright people to run those private cases. Let's control\nthem. Let's, let's have a greater threshold, but let's\nnot throw the baby out with the bath water. Because\neverybody seems to agree private cases help.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I want, I want to be fair.\nI interpreted your argument -- and please tell me if\nthis is incorrect -- as indicating that if I think\nstrong inference is greater, more onerous than more\nlikely than not, at the pleading stage, I then also have\nto say this is the instruction that must be given to the\njury? In order to avoid the, the discontinuity between\nthe pleading stage and what --\nMR. MILLER: The way you state it, Justice,\nis something very hard for me to respond to. Congress\ndid not change the persuasiveness, the proof burden. If\nyou go through the statute, you will see spots where\nthey did. Congress knew how to change proof standards.\nCongress knew how to change Federal rules.\nCongress did not change the proof in private\nactions. Congress did not change all of the background\nprocedure like the background procedure in Jones and --\nit is just not there yet. Congress did change a couple\nof Federal rules explicitly.\nSo I, I cannot comprehend how, if the case\nreached the jury, you would have to charge above\npredominance. And I, I think we've got a stone rolling\ndownhill to the dismissal point, which is why we have\nurged in the brief and why the Seventh Circuit was\nconcerned as was the Sixth about this jury trial\nimplication --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, and so I think we\nhave to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would\ninstruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it\ncouldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if\nimported into the pleading would always mean a strong\ninference. You see, that's -- that's the dilemma. And\nI don't see how to remain true to the words of the\nstatute which are strong inference, without actually\nproducing a dichotomy. And so either Congress can do it\nor it can't, and -- and -- and that's -- and we could\nfudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment.\nBut I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Miller, suppose\nCongress set up a entirely separate cause of action.\nIt's caused -- it's called a discovery cause of action,\nokay? And it sets forth as the condition for pursuing\nthat cause of action a standard that your, your\nallegation has to be indeed clear and convincing.\nOkay?\nAnd then if you win that, you can take\nwhatever you get out of the discovery and bring a\nlawsuit. Would that be unconstitutional?\nMR. MILLER: Why do I feel wind whipping\npast my ears as I go through a trap door?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Ironically, ironically, I think\nI have to say if Congress, leaving to one side\njusticiability problems with the discovery cause of\naction, if Congress created a discovery cause of action\nit could ascribe to it whatever incidents it wanted\nto --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Surely it could prohibit\ndiscovery altogether which it did before they adopt in\n1938.\nMR. MILLER: That is correct. And I don't\nthink anybody seriously argues that discovery is a\nconstitutional right.\nThe jury trial implications of this new\ncause of action are interesting. This Court has\nprotected post-1791 statutory claims and their right to\njury trial, but you're positing one that wasn't known in\n1791, and maybe it could be done without a jury. That's\nreally a hypothetical.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Miller.\nMr. Phillips, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI have to confess I'm -- I'm slightly\nperplexed by exactly what the Respondent's position is\nin this case so I'm inclined to kind of go back to the\ncore points that have been raised by the questions from\n-- from the Court. And in the first instance, it seems\nto me quite clear that the Seventh Circuit did not apply\nthe strong inference standard. If -- you can compare\nthe language from the First Circuit circuit that\nspecifically says it has to be reasonable and strong,\nstrong has completely fallen out here. I don't see any\nway to read it the other way.\nI think in response to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, which is how do, how should you write the\nopinion, I think the meaningful way to write the opinion\nis to be respectful of Justice Scalia's desire to\nprovide guidance. So I do think you should say, you\nhave to, as Justice Alito said, review the entirety of\nthe document and -- and infer both positively and\nnegatively as you go forward. We know that has to be\ntrue. Almost every court that's dealt with these issues\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're doing\naway with reading the allegations in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. Absolutely,\nJustice Ginsburg. There's no question that that's --\nthat that's what Congress had to have meant under these\ncircumstances. And the best example of that is the CEO\nwho sells securities during the time period of the class\naction. There are dozens of cases in which that\nhappens. Does it create an inference of scienter? It\nmight, because it's quite possible that he sold and --\nhe lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to\nsell. It is also possible that he sells only about 1\npercent of the stock --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Phillips, you\ndon't look at these things one at a time. You look at\nthem altogether.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the statute all you\nhad?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, I couldn't\ndisagree with you more about that. That is precisely\nwhat Congress says when -- when it says with\nparticularity. And when Congress says you have to look\nat each defendant. You cannot do --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It says you must plead\nthe facts with particularity.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But when one judges the\nadequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts\npleaded with particularity, not just one.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the strong inference of\nscienter is not pled on a group basis. It has to be\npled with respect to each individual defendant. So it's\nquite convenient --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I think that this\ncase was a good example. There were two defendants and\nthe court of appeals --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there were a lot more\nthan that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to take the two\nthat were at issue in this opinion. The court of\nappeals said the CEO, yeah, there's enough there to get\nover that threshold. The other guy, no, there wasn't.\nSo it's not that she's saying what you find\nfor one, you find for all. She is going at it defendant\nby defendant.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I -- I mean, I was\ncommenting primarily on Professor Miller's decision to\njust sort of sweep everything in and say look, back in\n1999 and 2000 when the Seventh Circuit itself\nspecifically said that the knowledge, for instance, of\nthe 5500 decline didn't happen until March of 2001. So\nI was just saying you can't start sweeping everything\nin.\nBut -- and it is true, the court\ndistinguished between those two individuals; but the\nbottom line remains the same. You have to analyze them,\neach. And you have to take into account contending\ninferences. You have to construe ambiguity contrary\nto the plaintiff sometimes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with a\nreport that you know exists because you had one of these\n26 confidential people tell you? But you haven't seen\nthe report, so you don't have the date on it? And you\nwon't know that date unless you have access to\ndiscovery. Do you have to assume the date is later\nrather than sooner?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think you better make an\nallegation with particularity that that date was at a\ntime when the individual would know that the -- that the\ninformation that he was conveying was -- was wrong. I\ndon't see how you can infer strongly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- if the\nplaintiff --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- scienter otherwise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The plaintiff can't know\nfor sure without seeing the document with a date on it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the plaintiff can ask\nthe confidential informant as much as, as he wants about\nthe information; and if he can't come up with it, that's\nthe price you pay. That was exactly what Congress said,\nis if you cannot make those particular allegations, then\nyou're out of luck. And it's not as though they give\nyou one shot for this.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Congress -- Congress used\nwords, \"strong inference.\" Those words are not\nself-defining. One can think of several ways, in fact\nthe courts of appeals did think of several ways. Why\nshould we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one\nmight define them?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I could be flip to say it's\nthe right way. But I think the -- I mean the answer to\nthe, the answer to why to choose our approach is because\nit is consistent with Matsushita and Monsanto and it\nwill allow, Justice Breyer, to apply it in an\nindividualized way, in a fashion that will give guidance\nto the lower courts. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
