        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 10-945, Florence v. The Board\nof Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nWe ask this Court to hold that a jail may\nstrip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable\nsuspicion. That is the rule that was applied throughout\nalmost the entire country in the three decades after\nBell v. Wolfish, without either administrative\ndifficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling. We're\nhere today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail\nand the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to\nstand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and\nstrip naked.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you apply the\nreasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees? I thought\nyou were making a distinction between felons and less\nserious offenders.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do apply it to all\narrestees. The Respondents and the U.S. Bureau of\nPrisons do draw a line at major versus minor offenders.\nI think they do that because they think that people who\ncommit more serious crimes might be inclined to greater\ncriminality. But our rule is one of reasonable\nsuspicion. Our question presented draws a line at minor\noffenders because this class definition is only people\nwho were arrested for minor offenses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the reasonable\nsuspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained\nfor a serious felony?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is in the view of the\ncourts that have considered this question, absolutely.\nIn our view -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your -- in your view?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, and, in fact -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you are going\non a case-by-case basis based on the offense.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The category -- there is a\ncategorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted by\nthese Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons, and four\ncourt of appeals, that says if you were arrested for a\nmore serious offense, categorically there exists\nreasonable suspicion.\nOur case-by-case rule, it's true, applies\nwith respect to minor offenders. And, again, that's the\nclass that was defined here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how would this work\nwith respect to individuals who have been arrested for\nserious offenses? Let's say someone has been arrested\nfor -- for assault. Say it's a case of domestic\nviolence, assault. Would that be enough to justify a\nsearch?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think you will have to\nask -- I know you want me to answer the question. Let\nme just be very clear. This is their rule. The\nRespondents draw the major/minor offense line. The\nRespondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. Now,\nin my view -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand. You say\nthat you don't want to draw that line; you want to apply\nit to -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- to everybody, and I'm\nasking you whether the mere fact that someone has been\narrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be\nsufficient to provide reasonable suspicion.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If the jail made that\njudgment, we would think that a court would not overturn\nthat judgment. We think that illustrates that, by\ncontrast to when someone is arrested for not paying a\nfine, that there is no justification whatsoever, because\nthe logic of their own policy is that this is a person\nwho's inclined to violence -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it -- I take it\nwhat we're trying to do is to protect the individual\ndignity of the detainee. But it seems to me that you\nrisk compromising that individual dignity if you say we\nhave reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you.\nYou're just setting us up, and you're setting the\ndetainee up for a classification that may be questioned\nat the time and will be seen as an affront based on the\nperson's race, based on what he said or she said to the\nofficers coming in.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so, it seems to me\nthat your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that\nthe blanket rule does not.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, a couple of points,\nJustice Kennedy. I think it's an incredibly important\nissue. They don't have a blanket rule. Remember, the\nRespondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They\ndo strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look\nfor contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth,\nlook at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion\nstandard.\nNow, to your very serious concern that maybe\nwe are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance\nof discrimination, remember that their rule is going to\nproduce more of that problem than ours, because their\nrule is not that they have to strip search -- they have\nto strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule\nis they can. They can make a choice.\nThis Court in the Fourth -- they say we -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure if it's\ntheir rule or our rule. Ultimately, it's going to be\nour rule.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, okay. Well, then -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: First let me say I hope not.\nI hope that your rule is that there has to be a\nreasonable suspicion standard, which is the rule that\nwas applied almost everywhere in the wake of\nBell v. Wolfish, without -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To do -- to do what?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You just said that strip\nnaked is different from a strip search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, exactly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what is permitted?\nThere are various things. One is showering in the\npresence of officers?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Showering in the presence of\nofficers is not something that requires reasonable\nsuspicion. The courts have uniformly concluded that if\nyou are just generally in an area in which you're being\nmonitored by the officers, that's not a Fourth Amendment\nsearch that violates a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. This is different.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they can be\ninspected without their clothes; just nothing more than\nthat?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There are two different\nscenarios. One is a common room where everyone is\nstanding around, and for jail security purposes -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A common?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: A common room, a common\nshower area. And, of course, for security purposes.\nThis is different, Justice Ginsburg. You\nasked what's prohibited in the absence of reasonable\nsuspicion. What's prohibited is standing 2 feet away\nfrom the person -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I want to know what's\npermitted.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, what is permitted is\nanything -- what is not subject to a reasonable\nsuspicion standard is anything other than looking at -\na close inspection of the person at arm's length. What\nthe courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the\nlower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and\nreally what I think concerned this Court in the Safford\ncase is that when you are standing so close to the\nperson inspecting their genitals, looking directly at\ntheir most private parts of their bodies, that is a\ndirect intrusion on their individual privacy -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Are you\n--are you suggesting three different levels? Stripping\nnaked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that the\ncourts have had to confront 5 feet versus 2 feet. What\nthey have confronted is they acknowledge that jails are\nplaces that require security. And so, if you're just\nobserving a shower room, that does not implicate a\nreasonable expectation of privacy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, are you\n-- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of\nthe search -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I'm taking -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that's at issue?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's the closeness of\nit. There is not a problem, I think, with the question\nof 2, 3, 4, or 5 feet. These searches all occur in the\nsame way, and that is the officer stands directly in\nfront of you. The testimony here is 2 feet away. That\nseems to be the common -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- unsure if it's okay\nto shower -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and have an officer\nwatch you shower naked.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- the greater\nintrusion is that you're standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet\naway?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Two versus 10 feet away or\njust generally observing the room. This is exactly -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that's a\nline, that doesn't make much sense to me.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then let's go to the\nnext line, which is -- that's one kind of search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The second is I think\nwhat some have called a visual cavity search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether you're going to\nhave the individual open or expose private parts.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you make an argument\nthat that's different than just a visual search?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You can. So, let me just\nsay -- let me just try and close off my answer to the\nquestion of the 5 versus 10 feet and then turn\nimmediately to this visual body cavity search.\nRemember, this is -- the Court will recall\nthat this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford\ncase, where the schools there argued that, well, there's\nan observation of these students in gym class, they\nshower together naked, they undress naked. And the\nCourt said it's quite different when you're standing\nright there looking over the student. Now, as to -- and\nsaid that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of\nprivacy, and the distinction did make sense.\nAs to your question, yes, there is a\nmaterial difference, we think, although we think both\nshould be covered by our rule. But a visual body cavity\ninspection as occurred in the Essex facility here, where\nyou require someone to bend over and cough, which is\nwhat the testimony is in this case -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One, not the other?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.\nThat -- the second jail had a slightly\ndifferent search protocol, in which the testimony is\nthat he was required to bend over and cough and expose\nhis anus for inspection. And the Respondents themselves\nregard that as a more significant intrusion, and they\napply a reasonable suspicion standard themselves to\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, what -- what\nyou propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some\nStates could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of\nwhat they have. But what you're asserting is that the\nFourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and\nthe obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth\nAmendment was adopted, this -- this was standard\npractice, to strip search people who were admitted to\nprisons. So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable\ninvasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the\ntime and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't believe that the\npremise is correct. If you read history differently\nthan me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you. But\nour understanding of the history is that the closest\nthey can come to is two things: First, that people were\nstrip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the\nrule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain\njails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a\nprocess of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual\ncleansing, would strip search new inmates. It had\nnothing to do with the jail officials themselves or\ntrying to intercept contraband.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is somehow less of an\nintrusion -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on your privacy, to be\nnaked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than\none jail official inspecting?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, it wasn't a\nnearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your\nquestion assumes. And it's just a different kettle of\nfish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that\nthat historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners\ncan strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as\nthey come in.\nI do agree with the basic premise of your\nquestion that it's -- our position can't just be that,\nhey, I've got a reasonable rule. I do have to, in\neither under the terms of Bell v. Wolfish or\nTurner v. Safley, establish that this is an exaggerated\nresponse, that this is much more, materially more than\nis necessary to accomplish their goals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But less intrusive than\nthe one -- the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved\npretrial detainees?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Ginsburg, we\ndisagree with that. At least as to the second search,\nwe think that there is no difference between the degree\nof intrusion here and in Bell. But there is another\nsignificant reason that this -- not just in the nature\nof the search, but a big difference between this case\nand Bell is that the inmates in that case made a\nvoluntary choice. They decided to have the contact\nvisits that was -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know if the\npretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry\ninto the facility?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do not. I tried\neverything I could to check the record of that case, and\nthere was no record of an admission strip search at the\nMCC at the time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is there -\nthere is a distinction between the simple strip search\nand the visual body cavity search. You say that they\napply reasonable suspicion standard to the visual body\ncavity search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, is the visual\ncavity search therefore off the table?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it is not. We contend\nthat the Fourth Amendment prohibited the visual body\ncavity search at the Essex facility. So -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right. But\nyou would say that they had to have a reasonable\narticulable suspicion before they could do that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We say that under their\nwritten policy, they should have, but they didn't. The\nBurlington County -- the only evidence about a\nconclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is\nthat the Burlington County intake officer filled out a\nform saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And\nEssex I don't believe contends that there was reasonable\nsuspicion to engage in a visual body cavity search.\nThey deny, as a matter of fact, that it happened.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, you see a\ndistinction between what they actually do and the\nwritten policy.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do with respect to the\nEssex -- I apologize -- no. What happened here is that\nEssex, after this search occurred -- and this is\ndescribed in the Essex brief in opposition, in case you\nwant to look at it later, at 3 in note 1. Essex, after\nthe search in this case, changed its policy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We were denied an injunction\ngoing forward under L.A. v. Lyons. So, we -- it's just\na question of damages for the search that occurred at\nthe time under their old policy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm confused about your -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- your position. Suppose a\njurisdiction has the policy of requiring every inmate\nwho is arrested and is going to be held in custody to\ndisrobe and take a shower and apply medication for the\nprevention of the spread of lice and is observed while\nthis is taking place from some distance by a corrections\nofficer, let's say 10 feet away. Is that -- does that\nrequire reasonable suspicion?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It does not. The -- and -\nand -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And so, your -- your only\nconcern is searches that go further than that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. The\nvery close inspection of the individual's genitals,\nwhich can occur absolutely so long as there is some\nminimal level of suspicion that's created.\nI do want to return to Justice Kennedy's\nconcern about dignitary interests here and whether\ndrawing any sort -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there -- could I just\nfollow up on that? Is there a dispute of fact as to\nwhether anything beyond that occurred in Burlington\nCounty?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In Burlington County, there\nis a dispute about the so-called genital lift, whether\nMr. Florence was required to lift his genitals or not.\nThere is no dispute that he was required directly in\nfront of an officer to strip naked, despite the officer\nhaving made a finding, which is on page 390 of the joint\nappendix, that there was no reasonable suspicion to\nconduct a strip search. That is the only factual\ndispute -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- in the entire case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you clarify two\npoints for me? The first is, was he admitted into the\ngeneral population at Burlington?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The record is not entirely\nclear. What the record says is that for the first few\ndays of his stay -- remember, he inexplicably was kept\nfor 6 days. For the first several days, he was kept in\na cell with only one other inmate, or possibly two, and\none time he had lunch with other people. In Essex, he\nwas admitted to the general population.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The prior charge against\nyour client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly\nweapon. Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that\nprovide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was\nmissing?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, because it depends -\nbecause of the breadth of the phrase \"possession of a\ndeadly weapon,\" as this case illustrates. The record\nshows that the possession of the deadly weapon -- and\nthat's why this charge was not pursued by the State -\nis -- was that he was pulled over at a traffic stop and\nhe drove away. The deadly weapon is the car in this -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, now you're feeding\ninto your adversaries' arguments that what you're asking\nthe police to do on intake, or the corrections facility\non intake, is to investigate in that fine detail. They\ncan't even look at the rap sheet -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and see use of a\ndeadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Sotomayor. The\nrap sheet does not contain that charge. What the rap\nsheet does show -- and we are perfectly fine with them\nlooking at the rap sheet. The rap sheet -- and it's in\nthe joint appendix. The rap sheet says that he had a\nsingle charge, he pleaded guilty, he got a term of\nprobation. There is nothing about that the jail would\nhave had any information suggesting that he had some\ncharge involving a deadly weapon. And that's why they\nthemselves certified that there was no reasonable\nsuspicion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the rap sheet\nalways available immediately? I thought it was rather\ncommon -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on\npractice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe\n24 hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire\nservices and the Internet to -- to report that he was\nwanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime\nin some other State.\nI mean, in my practice at least, county\njails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries,\nbecause you don't know who these people are. You arrest\nthem for traffic, and it may be some serial killer. You\ndo not know.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. First, that is not\nthe view of the jails in this case. Remember, they\napply a reasonable suspicion standard. They did not\nfind any concern in their own policies, neither does the\nMarshals Service, ICE, with this prospect of some prior\noffense.\nAs to what the rule is and how common it is\nand whether this works in practice, the jail here did\nlook him up in the New Jersey Criminal Justice\nInformation System. That's in the record. They're\nrequired by New Jersey law to do that. It's a -- every\nsingle one of these jails has computer access to the\nNJ CJIS, and also to the NCIC; they just type in his\nidentifying information.\nThey were able to pull him up without any\ndifficulty, and they have not complained that they\ndidn't have enough information about him. They filled\nout a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here.\nAnd remember, our rule only operates in a system,\nJustice Kennedy, in which the jail does have enough\ninformation. When -- our point is this: If the jail\nhas the facts, as it did here, to affirmatively\ndetermine that there is no reasonable suspicion, which\nis what they decided about Mr. Florence, then it is an\nextraordinary intrusion on dignity and autonomy to strip\nhim naked -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- when they have no reason\nto do so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, my\nunderstanding of the statistics -- and correct me if I'm\nwrong -- is that they get about 70 new people going\nthrough this process a day. Is there anything in the\nrecord about how much additional time it would require\nto look at each one, to look at their record, to\ndetermine which category they should fall into, to strip\nsearch or not, as opposed to having a blanket rule?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. There is because they\ndo this already. They -- it is not an administrative\nproblem. They apply our rule today. Remember,\nMr. Chief Justice, when he arrived at the Burlington\nCounty Jail, they did an assessment of him and\ndetermined that there was no reasonable suspicion. The\njails in this case did pull up his prior criminal\nhistory, and they have no problem doing that. They\napply our standard today. It is not a difficult one.\nBut -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, you -- YOU\nhave acknowledged that we have held that when you have\nvisitors, you may be strip -- strip searched after the\nvisit and the same kind of close examination that you\nobject to here. Now, your explanation why that is okay\nis that that is voluntary.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I have two explanations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That you don't have to have\nvisitors. Can you really condition your -- your having\nvisitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Block establishes that\nyou have no right whatsoever to have contact visits.\nSo, under Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, of course, you can\nsay I voluntarily relinquish my Fourth Amendment right\nin exchange for this privilege.\nBut I have a second -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure about\nthat?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can -- you can\ncondition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver\nof constitutional privileges?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I believe that\nthat's -- I think that's a fair statement of the law.\nI do have a second point, though, and that\nis that the principal reason underlying\nBell v. Wolfish's holding that those searches were\nreasonable is that it was essential to deter smuggling,\nand that deterrence rationale has much more of an\nattenuated relationship to this case.\nRemember that the inmate in that case was\nhaving a planned meeting with someone, and the\nrepresentation of the government is that our problem is\nif you plan to have somebody come visit you and you're\ngoing to have a contact visit, you can plan for them to\ntry and sneak something to you. This Court has set -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Goldstein, there, of\ncourse, were guards there who were watching the visits.\nAnd, as I understand that case, there was really no\nempirical evidence that smuggling came about as a result\nof these visits.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, can I just read to you\nwhat the Court said about that? Just so -- the Court\ndid have a slightly different take, I think. And this\nis from page 559 of the Court's opinion: \"That there\nhas been only one instance where an MCC inmate was\ndiscovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the\ninstitution on his person may be more a testament to the\neffectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent\nthan to any lack of interest on the part of the inmate\nto secrete and import such items when the opportunity\narises.\"\nAnd our point is that that -- when you have\nan unexpected arrest here -- remember, Mr. Florence\nshowed the paperwork that he was not wanted for arrest.\nAnd that's going to be generally true in all kinds of\ntraffic stops and the like -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, which is it you're\ndoing? I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying\nyou always need reasonable suspicion. So, I imagine a\ncase where the person is going to be arrested, put into\nthe general prison population. There is a warrant out\nagainst him for second-degree murder, and the policeman\nstopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because\nhe knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place.\nAnd the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come\nin here because of second-degree murder, we strip search\nyou. Okay? Can they do that under your rule or not?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all they know.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's reasonable\nsuspicion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you do not want to -\nthen you are not saying it always has to be reasonable\nsuspicion.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a debate about\nwords. We think that is reasonable suspicion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, all right. Well, that\nisn't helping me.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What helps me is to know\nwhat the category of things is that the jail in your\nopinion is going to have to look into the\ncharacteristics of this individual person, and when I\nlook at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And when I look at some of\nthe cases, there's a long list, like violence, drugs,\nand so forth, where you don't have to, where you can\njust use a general -- the fact that he was arrested -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for the thing. But there\nare other ones, minor ones, where you do. So, what's\nyour rule on that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Our rule that we would\naccept is that, with respect to minor offenders, that's\nwhen you assess -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then the next\nquestion which we'll get -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- who is a minor offender\nand how do you administer that rule?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. I think that is a\ngreat question for them, because that's their rule.\nThey have a rule that says for minor offenders that you\nhave to have reasonable suspicion to search for\ncontraband.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are trying to\nstate the constitutional rule, and you keep talking\nabout what is their rule, and we're trying to find out\nwhat are the limits -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the rule, and I\nthink you've already qualified what you said opening.\nOpening, you said reasonable suspicion is the rule for\neveryone, the felon as well as the minor offenders. Now\nyou seem to be saying, well, this case involves only\nminor offenders; so, let's limit it to that. That's\nwhat I thought you were saying now.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. Because\nthis case only involves minor offenders, we have\narticulated a rule with respect to minor offenders.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's what\nI'm -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Unfortunately, I'm asking\nyou and not them, and it's the same question.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you want us to write\nthis so that jail personnel all over the country -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- have to be able to\nfollow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: For three decades the rule\nthat was articulated by the Federal courts and applied\nwithout difficulty is one that says for minor offenses.\nWhen that was applied in practice it was basically done\nat a felony versus misdemeanor line. The court accepted\nthat if you are -- the courts accepted that if you are\nsuspected of a more serious offense, then for\nadministrative reasons and because we just think you\nmight be engaged in more criminality, then you don't\nhave to have any individualized inquiry whatsoever.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand that -- I\ncan understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why\nfor the search to see that -- if the person has any\nfleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other\ncommunicable disease before he's put into the general\npopulation? Are -- are felons more likely to have those\nthan non-felons?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, they are not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, that line makes no\nsense for that aspect of the search which is -- is just\nwe want to make sure that we have a clean prison.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not correct. That\naspect -- what the testimony in this case establishes is\nthat the jail guards allow any sort of medical rationale\nfor the search to be conducted by medical personnel, not\nby the guards themselves. All these inmates are\nexamined by a medical person, a nurse or the like, and\nthey are responsible for -- for -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that's where\nthe Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be\ndrawn? If you're examined close up by someone who has a\nmedical degree, it's okay? And, on the other hand, if\nit's someone who does not have a medical degree, it's\nnot okay?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That can't be the line as\nto whether your privacy is being invaded.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it can be the line,\nand it is the line that's been accepted for decades.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even for -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you would -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- body lice?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have to keep the person\nin custody, say, for 24 or 48 hours until the medical\npersonnel could come. Do you have 24-hour medical\npersonnel for intakes that are at 2 in the morning?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. The intake process,\nthe testimony is that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they are -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're telling us that\nevery county jail in -- in the United States has medical\npersonnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to do a -- a\nsearch?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I apologize,\nJustice Kennedy. I'm telling you what's in the record\nin this case. And that is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You said before was 2 feet\nis too close, but 5 feet is okay. Are you sticking with\nthat?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I'm saying\nthat a close inspection which is intended to examine the\nperson's individual -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- genitals, and whether\nit's at 2 feet or 4 feet I don't think is the relevant\nline.\nIf I could make one point, and then reserve\nthe remainder of my time, that that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask, on your\nmedical personnel, children in school get inspected for\n-- for head lice, prisoners for body lice. You don't\nneed a doctor to do that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, that's right, but if\nthat is right, what happens is that medical\nprofessionals are the people who are assigned that\nresponsibility. That's the testimony in this case. The\nonly last point that I wanted to make is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not\nconstitutionally required.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I agree. That -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's another thing\nthat -- that you don't need to -- they can inspect for\nbody lice, and that's -- that's okay?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If that's what they're\ndoing, I think that that is okay. The courts have said\nthat that is not itself a -- because of the prospect of\nhandling that problem with shampoo, which is what these\njails do, that that's not a sufficient -- a sufficient\njustification to require the person to strip naked.\nThe only other point that I did want to make\nis that this is the rule, not just at Burlington and\nEssex, but also of the U.S. Marshals Service, which has\nthe intake of 220,000 inmates every year, and also of\nthe Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement, which\nintakes 384,000 a year.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Government tells\nus that that's true only if they don't put the arrestee\nin the general population.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's not correct. That is\nonly the policy of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which has\nan intake of minor offenders of only a few thousand\npeople a year. For the Marshals Service and for ICE,\nwhich have a combined 600,000 people every year, they do\nnot have that separate housing rule.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you\nrebuttal time, but maybe just to be clear -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't -- do\nyou or do you not have an objection to the superseding\nECCF policy?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- if the -- we do,\nbecause they still have to stand naked directly in front\nof the correctional officer under the superseding\npolicy. What the superseding policy is, which is\nBurlington's policy throughout this, is that they will\nnot search the person for contraband, which is their\nsupposed interest here, for contraband, in the absence\nof reasonable suspicion.\nBoth jails at the time of this search and\nalso now will still require the person to strip naked,\nsupposedly for contraband, even though their own policy\nsays we won't search for -- we won't engage in the depth\nof search that's required, we won't look at the anus, we\nwon't look in the person's mouth, in the absence of\nreasonable suspicion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the current\npolicy?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the current policy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you have no\nproblem with that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do have -- I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you have no\nproblem with the reasonable, articulable suspicion\naspect of the body cavity search.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And with\nrespect to the simple strip search -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your only\nobjection is that the guard is too close to the inmate?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Thank you.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI actually appreciate the clarification that\nyour questions brought to this case, because I think\nthere's a bit of confusion that I'd like to try to clear\nup, although my -- my colleague's movement in terms of\nanswering some of the questions left me a little bit\nperplexed as to exactly what the nature of their claims\nare.\nThe -- the first question that it seems to\nme the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue\nhere. And, obviously, since the class certification\ndeals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims\ndeal with another set of issues, I think you have to be\ncareful.\nI think you have to focus on the policies\nthat existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he\nwas in fact searched under these circumstances. And the\npolicy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed,\nfrankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex\nwas aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily\nat tattoos and health.\nAnd the policy at Burlington was largely\na -- you come into prison, you give up your clothes,\nthey look through your clothes, you take a shower, they\nexamine you fairly cursorily, but look at you, and then\n-- then give you prison garb and move along your way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is the\nshower and look at you cursorily -- are those separate\nthings? Or is it during the shower?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It -- it's before or during.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because your friend\nplaces a lot of significance on how close -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the examination\nis. So, under that policy, how close was the\nexamination?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It almost certainly would\nhave been about an arm's length, because at that -- I\nmean, the problem is if you're exchanging clothes with\nsomebody, you're handing them clothes to change into,\nit's sort of hard to be longer than arm's length and\nactually get the clothes into his hand. So that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Two arms' lengths. I mean,\nhe could reach out, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Okay. Two arms' lengths.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\nright. They could take -\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I'm not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not right.\nYou could take the clothes off, put them in a bin -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person examines\nthe bin.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that's actually\nwhat they do in Essex. In Essex, they do it that way.\nThe difference between Essex is that Essex, in fact,\ndoes have -- I mean, part of the problem is\nterminological, all right?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: You know, Burlington is\nbasically a body visual observation, and the district\ncourt said that's unconstitutional, that just observing\nat all is unconstitutional.\nTo some extent, it seems to me my -- my\nfriend here has given up that part of the district\ncourt's decision, which -- then clearly the court of\nappeals, to the extent it reversed that part, ought to\nbe affirmed on that ground alone.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Visual observation from\nmore than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, although that -- that\nwas not the district court's theory. The district court\ndidn't say 2 to 3 feet.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What happened? Do\nwe know? Was the search within 2 feet or not within 2\nfeet?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on whose\nversion of it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We don't know.\nMR. PHILLIPS: You have to remember, the\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff\nin this case. So, you would have to -- you would have\nto interpret -- you'd have to give us the benefit of the\ninterpretation, which was that it was more than 2 feet.\nBut the court of appeals reversed, of\ncourse, without regard to that, because the court of\nappeals said, look, if you -- if you apply this Court's\ndecision in Bell v. Wolfish, it doesn't matter, because\nyou can engage in a much more intrusive true body cavity\nsearch, which frankly is more intrusive than even what\nEssex County asks -- has -- does in this case, because\nhe wasn't asked to bend over and to -- and to have a\nbody cavity anal search. What he was asked to do was to\nsquat and cough, in the event that -- because ordinarily\nthat will cause the contraband then to fall out, and you\ncan -- and you can catch it under those circumstances.\nSo, this is -- that's sort of the context in\nwhich this issue comes up.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, if I could\nunderstand your position, you think that there's no\nreasonable suspicion even for that more intrusive body\ncavity search; is that right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct. That's my -\nthat's the rule of law I'm asking for.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And does it matter to you\nwhether the person is being introduced into the general\nprison population, or would you also say that if the\nperson is not being introduced into the general prison\npopulation? Do you still think that there's no\nreasonable suspicion requirement?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would say, from my\nperspective, I think even -- even if they weren't going\nto be admitted into the general prison population,\nbecause the risks remain too substantial. But the truth\nis I don't have to defend that argument, because both -\nboth of these jails admit the -- their inmates into the\n-- into the general population 99.9 percent of the time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would a manual search -\nMR. PHILLIPS: So, that's not a line we\ndraw.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you say that\nregardless of the offense for which the person is\narrested? There have been some stories in the news\nrecently about cities that have taken to arresting\npeople for traffic citations. So, suppose someone is\njust arrested because they have a lot of tickets for\nbeing caught on speed cameras, let's say. That person\ncan be subjected to the searches that you're describing?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Alito. I think\nthe basic principle we're asking for is that deference\nto the jails and -- and to the administrators of the\njails requires that this Court respect their judgment\nthat you can't make a distinction based on that specific\nindividual; that whether somebody is a minor offender or\na major offender, one, is never all that clear in the\nfirst place, and, two, isn't a basis on which to\ndistinguish the risks that it poses to the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Try the ABA. The ABA is\nminor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you\nhave to have reasonable suspicion. Now, I've read\nthrough the briefs, and I can't find a lot of\ncontrabanders that were caught in that category. In\nfact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or\nless. So -- so, what is the justification for a rule to\navoid reasonable suspicion in that category?\nMR. PHILLIPS: If -- if you look at the\nexpert testimony that was before the court, in the\ndistrict court in this case, both the expert testimony\nof the plaintiff and the expert testimony of the\ndefendant -- this is at 348a of the joint appendix. It\nsays \"a greater presence of contraband amongst those\nindividuals that have minor offenses.\" That's his -\nthat's their expert's characterization, that minor\noffenders bring in more contraband than major offenders.\nOur experts said misdemeanants can be more dangerous and\nmore likely to bring in contraband -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a conclusion -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and we have a lot of\npractical experience because different States have\ndifferent rules, and San Francisco came in with I think\nthe toughest on your side, for your side. I just say,\nlooking through that, it's very hard to find somebody\nwho really was in this minor offender category, who\nreally was found to have contraband. So, what should I\nlook at to show that my initial reaction from a quick\nreading is wrong.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, do I just say this\nis a -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- I think you can go back to\nBell v. Wolfish, where this Court said that the fact\nthat there is not a lot of contraband being found may be\na testament to the effectiveness of the deterrent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why do we change the\npolicy? In Bell, we found that the policy was\nsuccessful. Even though there were searches, contraband\nstill got in. So, virtually every circuit -- in\npractice, the Federal system -- have been following this\nreasonable suspicion for minor crimes, and they've been\nfairly successful. So, why do we change the\nconstitutional rule to let them do more?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To invade more.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I think, first\nof all, anybody who thinks that the problems of\ncontraband are less serious today than they were in 1978\nis -- is ignoring reality.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I understand\ncontraband is serious, but most of the studies point to\nit not being on intake, but coming in through guards,\ncoming in through contact visits.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The great cause today is\nthat from corrupt correction officials.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, we can debate\nthat. But, Justice Sotomayor, it seems to me that the\n-- that the fundamental principle that ought to\nundergird the entirety of the Court's analysis here\ncomes out of Turner v. Safley and that line of cases,\nwhere -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I ask you\nsomething just in terms of your rule? I think your\nbrief says your rule is you're not entitled\nconstitutionally to any right of privacy in prison.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If that's the case, are\nyou saying that if the prisons decide on a manual\nsearch, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers\ncan manually check their cavities, is that -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Sotomayor. No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, there is some\nprivacy right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I can be clear about\nthis. It seems to me that Hudson v. Palmer and the -\nand the history of the Fourth Amendment clearly suggest\nthat there is no reasonable expectation of privacy of\nbeing viewed naked in a prison. And, therefore, the\nordinary Burlington approach of having somebody take a\nshower and looking at him or her naked for tattoos and\nhealth and incidental contraband, clearly\nconstitutional, clearly doesn't even raise a Fourth\nAmendment issue.\nWhen you get beyond that point and start to\nbegin the -- what Essex does, which is not a true anal\ncavity search but simply an anal-focused and\ngenital-focused search, I think that is subject to the\nTurner v. Safley and/or the Bell v. Wolfish standard.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to\nJustice Alito's question? Isn't one of the factors that\nwe look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness?\nAnd should we be thinking about the fact that many of\nthese people who are now being arrested are being put\ninto general populations or into jails, sometimes not\njust overnight but for longer periods of time, like this\ngentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate?\nShould we be considering a rule that basically says your\nright to search someone depends on whether that\nindividual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's\ngoing to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's\nbeen presented to a magistrate to see whether there is\nin fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of\nthis individual? I mean, there is something unsettling\nabout permitting the police to arrest people for things,\nlike kids who are staying out after curfew with no\nother -- based on probably nothing else.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Sotomayor, I think\nwhat is disturbing about -- about this case is, in fact,\nthe -- that he was arrested under circumstances in which\nhe candidly shouldn't have been arrested as a matter of\nState law. I understand that. But I think to change\nthe constitutional rule and to change the\nTurner v. Safley and Bell v. Wolfish standards and\nignore what the underlying inquiry should be here, which\nis these policies which apply across the board impinge\nconstitutional protections, but nevertheless\nrepresent -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the good-faith judgment of\nour jailers.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what are we doing\nwith the presumption of innocence? That's also a\nconstitutional right. And so, shouldn't the degree to\nwhich a search is permitted be conditioned in some way\non whether or not this person has been presented to a\nmagistrate?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- if you ask me the way I\nwould analyze it, I would -- if you want to adopt a\ndifferent set of standards about who ought to be\narrested and who ought to be taken to jail, that's fine.\nI understand that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I mean -\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I think once you're\ntalking about actually bringing someone into the jail to\nbe admitted into the general population and what is\nwithout question one of the most dangerous, most risky\nenvironments, in that context I would hope that this\nCourt, rather than asking individual jailers to make\ndecisions on the basis of -- where they clearly will not\nhave the kind of information you're asking them to make\nand where if they make a judgment wrong in either\ndirection, all it means is litigation. Either they -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I\nthought your friend said that is exactly what you do\nwith respect to the visual body cavity search,\nreasonable articulable suspicion, under the new policy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's what we do with a true\nanal body cavity search. What we -- I mean, we changed\nthe policy, to be sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: We changed the policy because\nof litigation concerns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, as I\nunderstand it, with respect to -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Liability concerns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- with respect to\nvisual body cavity searches, you require a particular\nindividual reason, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And you don't\nrequire that with respect to simple strip search?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So, you agree\nwith your friend that the only thing at issue here is\nhow close the guard is going to be to the individual who\nyou have no reasonable suspicion to think is different\nthan anybody else during a simple strip search?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -- no -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want -- he says\n2 feet is too close; 5 feet or whatever is okay. You\nwant to go to 2 feet. You don't want to have to stand\nback to 6 feet. That's all the case comes down to?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't -- well, I mean, you\ncan characterize it that way. I mean, I think the\nbetter way to think about it is that what Essex wants,\nwhat -- you know, what Essex policy permitted it to do\nwas to examine the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not interested\nin what Essex policy permitted it to do in the past.\nI'm looking at the new policy, all right? Under the new\npolicy, you have reasonable articulable suspicion -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for everything\nexcept simple strip search and observation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, see, that's the\nproblem, is that the language there is different.\nBecause the -- the truth is that the line that the new\npolicy draws is between a true -- what I -- what I think\nBell v. Wolfish was describing, where you ask the inmate\nto bend over and expose his or her anus for a cavity\nsearch. On that score, that's what -- we don't do that.\nBut we do, in fact, ask -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Phillips -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could I\nfinish and find out what you do? You said: We don't do\nthat. We do -- what?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. What we do is ask the\nindividual to lift his genitals and to squat and cough.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So, you do\nmore than a simple strip search.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, slightly more than a\nsimple strip search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, Mr. Phillips, there -\nthere -\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I don't think that's the\nline to draw. I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is still an issue in\nthe case beyond the ordinary visual inspection, and that\nis this: Even though you have changed your policy\nnow -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, we're still liable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the question remains\nwhether that change in policy was constitutionally\nrequired, so that when -- when you treated the -- the\nplaintiff in a different fashion under the old policy,\nthat was a violation of the Constitution.\nDoesn't -- doesn't that question remain in\nthe case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That question clearly remains\nin the case. I'm not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, there are two\nquestions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, we have to consider\nboth, the pure visual and also the inspection for\ncontraband.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And all I'm -- all I\n-- the only point I've been trying to make here is that\nif you -- if you look at the way the district court\nanalyzed the case, the district court split it up, and\nit's the basis of the class distinction versus the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record or common\nexperience justify an argument that if you have the\nperson who's stopped just for a traffic ticket, but that\nperson is going to be in custody for 5 or 6 days, that\nperson might well prefer an institution where everyone\nhas been searched before he or she is put into the\npopulation with -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, there\nactually is testimony in the record from the warden\nsaying that in order to ensure everybody's safety, we\nare better off with a blanket policy that says that\nwe're going to engage in -- in some form of the search.\nEssex has a slightly more intrusive one. But it is all\ndesigned to accomplish the same thing. It's not just\ndesigned to ensure against contraband and -- and that.\nIt's designed to ensure that there isn't somebody like\nMr. Florence who's going to end up being poked or\notherwise -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any evidence -- I\ncount seven or eight States anyway that have some\nvariation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what\nthey want, roughly. Is there any evidence at all that\nin those seven or eight States, there is more contraband\nbeing smuggled in?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is the testimony\nin the record from their expert, who said that in\nKentucky, there is today -- the single biggest problem\nin Kentucky prisons and the biggest cause of death is\ndrug overdose, which suggests that there's a serious\ncontraband issue in Kentucky. Kentucky is in one of\nthose -- is one of those -- is inside one of the\ncircuits that has had a reasonable suspicion requirement\nas a constitutional matter forever.\nSo, I would say there -- yes, there is some\nevidence from which you could infer that it's worse now\nthan it was. But I would also ask the Court to rely on\nits common sense and its own -- and what it essentially\ntook judicial notice of in Bell v. Wolfish and\nRutherford v. Black, which is this is a serious problem,\nand it is no less a serious problem today than it was\nmore than 30 years ago, when the Court addressed -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any limits -\nare there any constitutional limits, in your view? You\nsay you didn't attempt the kind of search that was done\nin Bell v. Wolfish. Is there any constitutional\nimpediment to your doing so?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't believe that -\nmy position would be, no, there isn't a constitutional\nimpediment, but -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there's no -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the balance would tip in\nfavor of the -- of the institution under those\ncircumstances. I do think -- obviously, there is a\nlimit between a manual physical body cavity search, and\nthat it seems to me, yes, I -- that would -- that would\nbe a very different balance of the equation, and I -- I\nsuspect I would be very hard pressed to just -- to\nconvince five members of this Court that that's the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to write\nan opinion that applies only to squatting and coughing.\nIs that it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you may want to write\nit slightly differently -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Scalia. No, but\nwhat -- but what I would really like is an opinion that\nrecognizes that deference to the prisons and to their\njudgment is what's appropriate under these\ncircumstances, and that extends all the way to the\nBell v. Wolfish line. The only difference being that I\nwould like for the Court to analyze it under Turner\nv. Safley, in which -- in which the analysis is -- is\nthis -- you know, is there a logical nexus between the\nrule that the -- that the prisons have and preventing a\nproblem? And the answer is yes. And are there\nreasonable alternatives? And there, the answer is no.\nIf the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are saying that they\ncan do the full -- as far as the Constitution is\nconcerned, all of these searches are permissible.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All -- clearly, all of our\nsearches are permissible, and I would go -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Bell v. Wolfish -\nMR. PHILLIPS: In Bell v. Wolfish. Yes. I\nthink that's exactly the holding of Bell v. Wolfish.\nBell v. Wolfish was not tied in its opinion itself to\nthe fact that they -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did -- they did\nstress that there was a visitor who could -- who could\ngive the inmate contraband. Bell v. Wolfish doesn't -\nand I asked Mr. Goldstein whether we know whether the\npretrial detainees in New York were searched that way on\nentry, and he said there's nothing that shows one way or\nthe other.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's -- I\nthink that's correct. We don't know. And, of course,\npart of the -- and part of the empirical problem in -\nin that is that that facility had only been open for 4\nmonths anyway. So, it was really going to be difficult,\nif you were going to adopt the policy they adopted in\nBell, to insist on some sort of empirical proof.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The one significant\ndifference between Bell and this case is that in Bell,\nthere was a real opportunity for people to plan, to\nconspire together to bring in contraband. Here, you're\ntalking about somebody who's arrested on the spot,\nthere's no opportunity for planning, for conspiracy with\nrespect to contraband, is there?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but the policy itself -\nmay I answer the question?\nThe policy is aimed at all people, not just\nat Mr. Florence, and if you aim it at all people, there\nare people who self-report who've obviously got an\nopportunity to bring in contraband, and there are a lot\nof people who just get arrested and happen to have drugs\nor something on them and, rather than show those when\nthey're being stopped for a speeding ticket, will likely\nstick it in their pocket or put it somewhere else.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe searches at issue in Bell are very\nsimilar to the searches at issue in this case, and they\nshould be upheld. I want to start with Justice Kagan's\nquestion. It is true that contact visits in Bell are\ndifferent from a person coming into the -- to the jail\nfor the first time in that there might be a greater\nopportunity for planning, but as one of the Justices\npointed out, there was less of an opportunity to\nactually get contraband, the person coming in was going\nto be searched, the inmate, as Justice Marshall pointed\nout, was wearing a one-piece zip-up jumper, and he's\nbeing watched the entire time.\nThe visit -- the contraband situation in\nthis case at intake, the person does have an\nopportunity, even if they are not self-reporting,\nknowing that they're going to be arrested. Protesters,\nfor example, who decide deliberately to get arrested.\nThey might be stopped by the police, they see the squad\ncar behind them. They might have a gun or contraband in\ntheir car and think, hey, I'm going to put that on my\nperson; I just need to get it somewhere that's not going\nto be found during a pat-down search. And then\npotentially they have the contraband with them.\nAlso, the process of going from the\narrest -- point of arrest to the general jail population\nis not a quick one. The person typically goes, for\nexample, to a metropolitan police department -- that's\nwhat happens here -- and the person would mix\npotentially there in a holding cell with other\noffenders.\nIf this Court, for example, adopted a rule\nsaying that minor offenders would not be searched in a\nway that other offenders would, I have no doubt that\nthere are some offenders in those circumstances, all on\nthe bus together to go to the general jail population,\nwho would give the stuff to the minor offenders -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how does that -\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- to try to get them to\nbring it in.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the Federal\nrule. And, by the way, the brief was really confusing.\nWhen what -- when I read page 1, page 1 tells me that\nthe BOP policy requires all incoming pretrial detainees\nto be subject to visual body cavity inspections. And\nthen it isn't until page 30 that I learn there is an\nexception for the very category of arrestee that we're\ntalking about here, that they are not subject to body\ncavity inspections unless there's reasonable suspicion\nthat they're concealing contraband. That the\nmisdemeanor or civil contempt offender is not subject.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if that was\nconfusing. The Bureau of Prisons' policy is that a\nperson will not be put in the general population, being\nallowed to mix with other offenders, unless he or she\nhas undergone the strip search.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I want to know\nhow people in this category are treated in the Federal\nsystem. And you -- you -\nMS. SAHARSKY: The people -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You reversed it. They -\nthose people are not subject to this visual body cavity\nsearch.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Those people, when they go\ninto the jail, would be asked whether they're willing to\nconsent to this type of search. In most cases, they do\nconsent. If they don't consent and there is not\nreasonable suspicion, then they are not placed in the\ngeneral jail population; they are kept separate from the\nother offenders. So, it is the case, the rule that the\nThird Circuit identified, which is a blanket policy that\nanyone that's going to go into the general jail\npopulation and mix with everyone else has to be strip\nsearched. That is the Federal Bureau of Prisons'\npolicy. I should note that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm sure\nI missed something. You say when they go in they're\nasked: Will you consent to a more intrusive body cavity\nsearch and be put into the general population; or if you\ndon't, you don't have to be searched and we put you in\nsome place else. Who consents to that?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the general jail\npopulation has certain facilities, you know, computer\nfacilities and others that you don't get when you're in\na cell by yourselves. As a practical matter, this\narises very, very infrequently in the Federal system.\nWe're talking about fewer than 1 percent of offenders.\nAnd the question before the Court at this\npoint really is you have before you a blanket policy\nsaying we need to strip search everyone, and is that\nsomething that's unreasonable or irrational in the way\nthat the Court has considered its normal deference to\nprison officials? And I just -- I would like to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand most of the\ngeneral propositions that your side is advancing, but I\nhave to say I was somewhat surprised at the evidence of\nthe amount of contraband that was discovered, the amount\nof weapons that was discovered that's in the literature\nand that's in the citations, of course, was somewhat\nskimpy. I thought there would be a stronger showing\nthan I -- than I found in the briefs.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, there -- there are not\nempirical studies of this type of information.\nTypically it arises when there are incidents at a\nfacility, and incident reports are written up. They're\nnot published regularly. There's not some kind of\nlaboratory study that you can do. The facilities have\nan incident that they try to deal with. Sometimes it\nmakes the news. Those are some of the things that we\nreported. And I would hate for the Court to think that\nthere is not evidence of people who've committed -\nminor offenders in the record bringing in very serious\nthings into prisons and jails.\nI'd point you to footnote 15 in the\nGovernment's brief, which talks about people being\narrested for traffic offenses and smuggling crack pipes\nin body cavities. I'd point the Court to both experts\nin this case cited by Mr. Phillips. I'd point the Court\nto the record in Bull, the San Francisco case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The issue has to be\ncertainly some misdemeanor. Some people charged with\nmisdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in. The\nissue is how many of them would not have been found on a\nreasonable suspicion standard? I think Justice Breyer\nsaid, in the San Francisco study, it appears only one.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's a very\nhazardous thing for courts to do with 20/20 hindsight.\nYou know, the Court could look back at individual\noffenders and might have information -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we don't have 20/20.\nWe have how many years? Fifteen years since Bell -\nMS. SAHARSKY: What I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- where prisons have\nbeen applying the reasonable suspicion standard. And\nthe most you can muster under that standard is one\nexample of a case where someone has entered? At some\npoint, empirical evidence has to mean something in terms\nof us judging the question of reasonableness.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I agree with you, but what\nI'm saying is that the individuals who are doing the\nsearches at issue have very limited information about\npeople. This is when you have people who are coming\ninto the first -- the system for the first time. They\nhave had the most contact with the outside world. You\nhave the least amount of information about them. In the\nFederal system, you don't know -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- I do have a\nquestion about that today. I know that when -- it's bad\nto base your judgments on your own personal experiences.\nWhen I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a\nrap sheet. I understand that that's no longer the case\ntoday, that they're virtually almost always accessible\nby computers today.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That may be true, but it's\nnot the information that the people who do intake and\nare doing the searches have. They do not have that\ninformation at their fingertips in the Federal system.\nThey have name, date of birth, and they have the offense\nthat the person was charged with. They don't know\nanything else.\nAnd the question before the Court, if I may,\nis whether there are reasons for a blanket rule that\nthis Court should defer to. And I would say there are\nseveral.\nFirst of all you cannot say that there are\nsome minor offenders that don't pose a contraband risk.\nThey are documented in the record. Second, you have\nindividuals who are making very quick determinations.\nThey're -- they have large numbers of people to -- to\nget through -- into the general prison population. They\nhave very little time, and if they guess wrong, those\nmistakes can be deadly. Third, the rule needs to be -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose we accept the\nPetitioner's concession that it is permissible to\nrequire everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower\nunder the observation of the corrections officer from a\ncertain distance. Now the question would become: How\nmany people who do that will still be able to smuggle in\ncontraband?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, there would be\ncontraband found in -- that would be in body cavities.\nAnd we have documented in this record and other records\nin our brief that there are folks who do that, and that\ncontraband is not found until they do these squat and\ncough procedures.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's my -- that's my\nproblem. I don't -- I overstated the -- the strength of\nyour evidence. I was just trying to throw it out -- or\nI understated it. San Francisco's point is really that\n30 to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people\nwho come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have\nbeen -- and there is just that footnote really which has\na few examples. Definitely, they're there in this\ncategory. So, would it be helpful if you included in\nthe excluded part people who are high on drugs? You\nsee? So, we give you the high on drugs people. It's\nthe drug offense, and those who are high on drugs and\nthose -- I mean, is there a way of drawing this rule\nthat we can even catch most of the people in footnote\n50 -\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think the fundamental\nquestion for the Court is who is supposed to be doing\nthis line drawing. And you've said case after case\nafter case that you're going to defer to the prison and\njail officials who are seeing this stuff on the ground\nday to day.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's obvious that the\nsimplest thing for any prison official is say do it for\neverybody.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, the fact they do it\nfor everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for\ntraffic violators or something might be consistent with\nlittle or no evidence; it might be consistent with some.\nThat's why I keep looking for it.\nMS. SAHARSKY: There are many good reasons,\nthough, to have a policy to do it for everyone. It is\neasily -- easy to administer when you have lots of\npeople. It is done for the protection of people like\nPetitioner who don't want to be knifed in the shower -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reason? If\nthere's so much sense to that policy, why isn't it the\nFederal policy? Before you said because there aren't\nthat many offenders. If there were more, then would\nthere be -- would the Federal policy change so that even\npeople who are in on a contempt charge or a minor\ncrime -\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. The Federal Government\nthinks that that blanket policy is a good one. It made\none modification to its policy in 2003 when the weight\nof the circuits was against it. But, again, this is a\npolicy that is done for everyone's protection. A point\nthat Justice Kennedy made earlier is that there -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry, I didn't\nunderstand. You think the Feds think it's a good policy\nto inspect everyone?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, to inspect everyone who\nwould be put in the general jail population. That is\nthe Third Circuit's holding, and that's what we're\ndefending in this case. That's -- because when you have\na rule that treats everyone the same, you don't have\nfolks that are singled out. You don't have any security\ngaps. We urge you to affirm the judgment of the court\nbelow.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Goldstein, take 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, sir.\nI have three points to make: The first is\nthat my friend from the United States says defer to the\nexperts. But the point that the United States\nconsistently omits is that there are 600,000 offenders\nthat go into the Federal system every year. I don't\nunderstand the claim that -- this only involves 1\npercent of Federal offenders.\nThe Marshals Service and ICE admit 600,000\noffenders every year under our standard. They are not\nkept in separate housing. These are cited in our brief.\nSix hundred thousand people, is their expert judgment,\nare subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when\nthey're admitted to jail.\nThe second point, about numbers,\nJustice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study,\nand that is the County of Orange case. The district\njudge there did an unbelievably detailed job going\nthrough the record of 26,000 admissions into the system\nand was able to identify only a single instance where\ncontraband would have gotten in under a reasonable\nsuspicion standard.\nThere is also evidence in this case, and it\nis the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep\npointing to. There's a memorandum from the Essex jail\nsystem. It's at page 70a to 71a of the joint appendix.\nAnd it tells you two really relevant things. It says\nevery year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and\nthat they only found 14 instances of contraband. And\nthey don't even make the claim that those 14 instances\nout of 25,000 would not have been found under a\nreasonable suspicion standard. So, you have evidence in\nthis record about this particular case.\nThird, a couple of points have been made\nabout whether -- Justice Breyer, you asked whether\nsomeone who's high on drugs. The uniform rule -- and\nthis is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the\nAmerican Correctional Association. What they say is\nthat essentially almost anything will do. What will not\namount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor\noffender -- and we do have -- there are 700,000 people\nin jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor\noffenses. This is -- this is a lot of people who are\nhaving a very significant intrusion on privacy.\nAnd the expert standard, the rule that was\napplied under Bell v. Wolfish, is that when you have\npeople who come in on a minor offense -- they don't have\nany drug history. They are not high on drugs. There\nwas no opportunity to hide a weapon. I'm not sure where\nthey think the gun is going to be hidden that's not\ngoing to show up in the very close manual pat down that\nthey do of every one of these people that isn't going to\nshow up in -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't think you're really\narguing for a -- an individualized reasonable suspicion\nstandard. I think you're arguing for a rule that draws\ndistinctions based on categories that correspond only\nperhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, there are real\ncategories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails,\nlike if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug\nhistory. And then on top of that, if there's any\nindividualized basis that the jails can articulate, that\nwill do as well.\nWe are not saying that categorically people\nwill be excluded from being searched. We're saying that\nthere are entire categories that will automatically be\nsearchable. We're just saying don't throw the baby out\nwith the bath water.\nWhen somebody is pulled over like Mr.\nFlorence, and there's just -- it's laugh-out-loud funny\nto think he's smuggling in -- something into this jail;\nthat it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the\ndirect, you know, 2 feet away, I'm going to look at your\ngenitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying\nwe're going to oversee the showers.\nThere is no evidence when it comes to that\ngroup of people, and there are a lot of them, that they\nrepresent anything like a material threat of smuggling.\nAnd this is a very significant intrusion on individual\nprivacy and individual dignity.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
