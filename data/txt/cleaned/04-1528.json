Sorrell, and\nthe consolidated cases.\nMr. Bopp.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nIN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530\nMR. BOPP: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAs this Court made clear recently in\nRepublican Party of Minnesota v. White, since political\ncandidates are the ones who take office, it is\nimperative that they be allowed freely to express\nthemselves on matters of current public importance. As\na result, this Court has never allowed the government\nto prohibit candidates from communicating relevant\ninformation to voters during an election.\nVermont, however, has adopted low expenditure\nand contribution limits for the opposite purpose,\nreducing overall candidate campaign spending, and these\nlimits would have that effect. This is fundamentally\nincompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the\nFirst Amendment and is not justified by any truly\ncompelling governmental interest. As a result, they\nare unconstitutional.\nNow, Vermont's expenditure limits are an\nunprecedented, direct restraint on candidate speech.\nOnce these low expenditure limits are exhausted, a\ncandidate may not drive to the village green to address\na rally, may not return the phone call from a reporter\nat the local newspaper, and may not call a neighbor to\nurge her to get out to vote. This Court has never\nallowed the government to prohibit candidates from\ncommunicating this sort of relevant information during\na campaign.\nFurther, this Court has long held that more\nspeech is better than less speech. As long as\ncontribution limits are available to address any\nrealistic concerns about corruption, the public will\nbenefit from candidates' being allowed to spend all\nthat they can lawfully raise in their campaign.\nNow, the record is clear in this case that\nthe expenditure limits will deprive candidates of\nsubstantial resources. The district court erroneously\nlooked at average spending over the last three\nelections and found that in all but one category, that\nis, Senate candidates running in single-member\ndistricts, that the average spending for all candidates\nin those campaigns were below the limits set by the\nexpenditure limits in Vermont.\nHowever, in Buckley, the last case for --\nwhere this Court considered candidate expenditure\nlimits, the Court looked at the number of races\naffected, not the average spending in all races. And\nin Buckley, the Court looked at the expenditures in\nU.S. Senate races and found that in previous election,\nthat 26 percent were over the mandatory expenditure\nlimits considered in Buckley, and in the House, 3\npercent of the races had spending greater than the --\nthese limits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, would you\nclarify a procedural point? As I understand it, on the\nexpenditure issue, there is no final decision that has\ngone back to the district court for further\nproceedings.\nMR. BOPP: Well, there were -- that is\ncorrect, that there is a remand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it may -- the district\ncourt might -- may well find that nothing passes\nconstitutional muster in the end.\nMR. BOPP: Well, they could potentially, yes.\nHowever, the -- the Second Circuit did -- did make\ndecisions of law. They found that these two interests\nthat the State is alleging, that is, in preventing\ncorruption and in conserving incumbent time, were\ntogether a compelling governmental interest, and we --\nwe allege that they are not and that on this record,\nthis Court can determine that they are not -- they are\nnot together a compelling governmental interest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you arguing now then\nthat there may be no limits on expenditures?\nMR. BOPP: Well, the -- this Court has now\nconsidered, including this case, a dozen times in which\nthe government has sought to limit expenditures, either\nof candidates or PAC's or political parties, and\ndespite the work of the most brilliant lawyers in the\nUnited States, they have not come up with any\ncompelling governmental interest that this Court has\naccepted. And we believe that this record demonstrates\nthat these claimed interests either are not compelling\nor are not proven.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- when -- when you\nmake that point, that on this record the -- the claimed\ninterests are not compelling or not proven, would you\nhave us leave the door open for a greater degree of\nproof? For example, take the -- the problem of\ncandidate time. The lower the donation limits are, the\n-- the more donations there have got to be, and -- and\nthere's -- there's plenty of comment, particularly in\nsome of the amicus briefs, on the amount of time that\npolitical candidates generally spend scrounging around\nfor money. If we decided the case your way, would the\ndoor be left open for a more impressive and compelling\nrecord on this issue?\nMR. BOPP: Well, we -- we are asserting that\nthat is not a compelling interest in and of itself, and\nthis Court should reject it. I -- I just don't see --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you also say, on this\nrecord.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. And in addition -- well, the\n-- the point about it not being a compelling interest I\nthink is an analytical point that doesn't have to be --\nthat doesn't rest on this -- strictly on this record.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- I take it your point\nthen on the combined corruption/competition for money\nproblem is that there isn't any record that would\nsupport it.\nMR. BOPP: If it were a compelling interest,\nthere's no record here that is a problem in Vermont.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but you're saying\nthis combination cannot be a compelling interest as a\nmatter of law, consistent with the First Amendment. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, it is. I don't see how it is\na compelling governmental interest to limit challengers\nto only fund-raise to the extent that an incumbent\nfinds comfortable or convenient.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or at least where -- where\nthe limitation -- you make a big point of this in your\nbrief as -- as I -- as I recall. At least where the\nreason the candidate would have to spend so much time\nis the very small contribution limit established by the\nsame statute. It's -- it's rather like the -- the\nmurderer asking for mercy because he's an orphan,\nhaving killed his parents.\nMR. BOPP: It is a self-justifying statute by\nimposing the lowest contribution limits in -- in the\nNation, adjusted for inflation for 1974 dollars, when\nthe $1,000 limit was approved. This is a contribution\nlimit of $50 for an --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to get back to\nJustice Souter's questions, could you answer it this\nway? Let's assume that some members of the Court\nsimply accepted the proposition that money buys access.\nAnd -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of\nthat, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion\nthat we can reach. And you tend to fight this in your\nbrief to say that this doesn't happen. I tend to doubt\nthat. I tend to think money does buy access. What --\nif -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would\nfollow?\nMR. BOPP: Well, I think it's not a matter of\njust access. It has to be a matter of privileged\naccess that this Court found in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Let's say it's\nprivileged access.\nMR. BOPP: Well, if it -- if it's privileged\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, isn't the answer\nthat the -- that this is up to the voters. The voters\ncan see what's going on and throw the legislator out if\nthey choose.\nMR. BOPP: Indeed, and in fact, the -- there\nare other less restrictive ways of -- of dealing with\nthis. For -- for instance, Vermont prohibits\ncontributions from lobbyists during the session. Other\nlegislatures have imposed a prohibition on incumbents\nfrom raising any money during the time the legislative\nsession -- the legislature is in session. So there are\nways of dealing with the question of access that are\nnot the blunderbuss approach here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it is true that all\nthe polls say that there's public disaffection and\ncynicism. Does that translate into action to defeat\nincumbents who take particularly large sums of money?\nIs there -- is there statistical evidence to show that?\nMR. BOPP: I'm not aware of that. But\ncertainly the press and opponents often, you know,\npoint to examples where they believe that their\nchallenger is under too much of an influence of a\nparticular entity, and the voters, you know, in certain\ncircumstances take that into account in their voting.\nAnd furthermore, it is true that there is a\ngeneral cynicism about politicians and government that\nhas existed since the first colonists came to our\ncountry and continues today. In fact, our governmental\nsystem is established on the proposition that we need\nto limit the -- the government, and we need to have\nchecks and balances because we don't want free rein by\npoliticians because we are concerned about their\nexercise of power.\nBut if this is enough --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May ask you this question,\nMr. Bopp? This -- in -- following up on Justice\nGinsburg's inquiry, is it your view that there is no\nset of facts, no matter how scandalous and so forth and\nso on, Watergate and all the rest of it, could ever\njustify an expenditure limit?\nMR. BOPP: That is not our position.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if that's the case,\nthen why -- why would it be inappropriate to have\nfurther hearings in this case to see whether they're --\nthey could be justified?\nMR. BOPP: Because there have been legal\nfindings by the Second Circuit that we believe are\nerroneous. The -- the first, as I mentioned\npreviously, is that -- that we do not believe that the\n-- preserving incumbents' time through expenditure\nlimits can ever be a compelling governmental interest,\nto limit what challengers can spend -- raise and spend\nin their own election. I mean, this interest -- the\nexpenditure limits don't apply just to incumbents who\n-- if there is a concern about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. I'm just\ncurious to know what sort of -- what sort of evidence\ncould ever support an -- an expenditure limit in your\nview, if -- if any.\nMR. BOPP: I have a -- a very difficult time\njustifying expenditure limits.\nI know there's a debate on this Court on\nwhether or not there are per se situations under the\nFirst Amendment. If there was ever a candidate for a\nper se First Amendment ban on a law, surely it would be\nthis type of case. In other words, we are talking\nabout speech that is at the core of the First\nAmendment, and secondly, we are talking about candidate\nspeech. Candidates are the ones that go into office.\nThey are the ones that are going to be exercising\ngovernmental power. These low expenditure and\ncontribution limits would have the effect of making\ncandidates a bit player in their own election so that\nthe voters --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, with respect\nto the contribution limits, what -- what makes this\ncase different from the -- the Shrink PAC case from a\nfew years ago?\nMR. BOPP: Well, several things. First is\nthere was actually a paucity of evidence in the Shrink\nPAC case. There was only an allegation of one PAC that\nwanted to give one contribution to one candidate, and\nthis Court said that, you know, you didn't need a lot\nof evidence to combat such a weak -- weak claim.\nSo secondly is the novelty and plausibility\nof a -- adjusted for per election in 1974 dollars of a\n$50 contribution limit, that that would actually give\nrise to realistic concern about actual and perceived\ncorruption. So, again, in Shrink PAC --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it --\nyou think it's the dollar amounts that are involved?\nMR. BOPP: Well, one of the decisions that\nthe Court has to make under your jurisprudence is that\n-- that contribution limits can only eliminate large\ncontributions that give rise to this realistic\nperception or actuality of corruption. So it is --\nwhether it's large or not and giving rise to that\nconcern because of the size, that is an integral part\nof the Shrink analysis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it was pointed out in\n-- in one of the briefs -- and I -- I didn't go back\nand check it myself, but I'd like your comment. It was\npointed out in one of the briefs that the limits in\nVermont were substantially close to or even -- even\nhigher than the -- than the limits in the Missouri\nscheme, out of which the Shrink litigation grew. Do\nyou know whether that is correct?\nMR. BOPP: Well, it depends on how you -- you\ncompute it. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It always -- it always does,\nyes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOPP: The -- well, certainly what the --\nwhat the evidence was in Shrink was it was a $1,075\nlimit, again adjusted for inflation, was about $375\nadjusted for inflation compared to the Buckley limits,\nand because of the paucity of evidence and the fact\nthat it wasn't really novel to say that a $1,000 limit\ncould give rise to corruption because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there were lower\nlimits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice\nSouter was asking about.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were the thousand\ndollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, take the whole schedule\nin Missouri.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. Well, the -- the\ncontribution limits that this Court considered was the\n$1,075 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there was a court\nthat subsequently considered the rest and upheld the\ncontribution --\nMR. BOPP: Yes, there was. The Eighth\nCircuit did so and the -- the lowest limit there was\n$275 per election, which would be $500 for -- for the\n-- the entire election cycle. And the -- and -- but\nreally that -- that was on a -- a record that this\nCourt found to be, frankly, inadequate to -- to raise\nany serious questions about the -- whether the amounts\nconcerned gave rise to a realistic threat of\ncorruption.\nAnd the record here demonstrates that -- that\nthe -- that the only time really there is a actuality\nor perception of corruption in Vermont is when they --\nis when we're talking about amounts in excess of\n$1,000. That was the prior limit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we -- we didn't send it\nback so that more of a record could be made, did we?\nMR. BOPP: No. No.\nAnd, you know, we had a 10-day trial. We had\nnumerous witnesses here. The -- Shrink had been\ndecided. I mean, there was -- everything was before\nthe court to consider the -- the matter.\nAnd so, you know, they had their chance at --\nat proof. And -- and in the numerous witnesses, they\nmade their best case. They could not identify one\nsingle politician in Vermont that was -- that anyone\nwould -- would claim was corrupted in any way by a\ncontribution -- by contributions under $1,000. They\ncould not name one single incumbent politician in\nVermont that neglected any specific duty that he or she\nhad.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but you know. You\nexpect them to name names? I mean, here --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOPP: Well, if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really, that -- that's --\nthat's a lot to ask.\nMR. BOPP: Well -- well, they at least have\nto give, you know, realistic circumstances. They gave\na few circumstances --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose three\nlegislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal\ncorruption, actually taking no wink-wink, nod-nod, a\nspecific agreement to vote for money. So what? Does\nthat change your case?\nMR. BOPP: Well, the -- the responsibility\nthat Shrink imposes is to -- to demonstrate both actual\nand perceived corruption at that the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose that had\nbeen demonstrated in -- in a particular State. Does\nthat mean, in your view, that a State can have strict\ncontribution limits and support?\nMR. BOPP: If it's just anecdotal, no. It\nhas to be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It's true. It's --\nit's done. There have been criminal convictions.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the -- if it's isolated\nexamples that are unconnected to any perception of\ncorruption at that level, then it would not be adequate\non -- on its -- on its -- by itself.\nNow, of course, in Shrink, the Court cited to\nboth actual and perceived evidence of corruption at the\nlevel that the -- you were considering that limit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, if -- if you\n-- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to\nback away from the proposition that the case I put\nwould be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for\nlegislative limits, then I suppose you can say the\nState has the power to prevent this from happening to\nbegin with.\nMR. BOPP: Well, this Court has never\napproved restrictions on fundamental First Amendment\nvalues based purely upon speculation or concern about\nsomething that's happening some other place. In other\nwords, these are real limits on people in Vermont, and\nit seems to me that to approve the lowest contribution\nlimits in the Nation and these very low expenditure\nlimits, the State would have to demonstrate that\nVermont is the most corrupt State in the Nation. And\nthey're far from it. In fact, the opposite --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only -- only the most\ncorruptible.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOPP: Nor corruptible. The -- the\nevidence is quite clear. Even in the few examples that\nthey cite to like the tobacco industry passing out $40\nchecks after a -- a vote defeating a bill. Of course,\nthat's still legal under this -- this act. But, you\nknow, even pointing out that they -- that the person\nwho talked about that example made it clear that he\ndidn't believe anybody was -- was influenced by post-\ncontributions after a vote regarding a matter that's\nnot even prohibited by this -- by this act.\nSo it was -- it was a lot of testimony about\nhow truly clean Vermont is, not the most corrupt, where\npeople -- politicians would be tempted at these quite\nlow limits to, you know, sell their honor and -- and\npersonal, you know -- and their -- and affect their\nown, you know, personal character and reputation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bopp, toward the end of\nyour brief, you -- you make the argument that if we\naccepted the State's position in this case, we\nimplicitly would have accepted the position that\ntotally -- totally publicly funded elections would be\nconstitutional. And -- and I -- I realize your -- your\nconcern there was with expenditure limits, obviously,\nnot contribution limits. You didn't come out and say\nit, but I -- I assume your position is that that would\nbe unconstitutional per se. A totally publicly funded\nscheme would be unconstitutional per se.\nMR. BOPP: The key would be if it's mandated,\nvoluntary --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. BOPP: If it was mandated, yes, it would\nbe unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and its\nunconstitutionality would rest on the limitation on\nexpenditure, in effect?\nMR. BOPP: Yes. Oh, yes. Well, there would\nbe a prohibition in that case if I understand your --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, yes, yes.\nMR. BOPP: -- on -- on contributions, and\nthere would be also a -- a mandatory expenditure limit\nbecause you could only spend what the government gave\nyou. So that would have all those features.\nNow, if it was, of course, voluntary, it\nwould solve the -- the two problems that -- that the\nState talks about because if you have a voluntary\npublic funding system -- and this is, again, why remand\nis -- is inappropriate. You don't need to go back and\n-- and determine whether or not the legislature\nconsidered providing adequate public funds. I mean,\nit's whether that alternative exists.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But on -- on your view, if\n-- if there were a -- a mandatory publicly funded\nscheme and the -- the limits on expenditure were very\nhigh -- it was a very generous scheme. They gave them\nlots of money -- it would still be unconstitutional\nbecause there would be -- I -- I take it on your view,\nbecause there would be an elimination of any way to\nparticipate by contributing. Is that correct?\nMR. BOPP: There would be an absolute\nprohibition, and this Court in -- in Beaumont reserved\nthat question of whether or not an absolute prohibition\n-- and -- and then in McConnell, you struck down the\nabsolute prohibition on minors' contributing to\ncampaigns. So, yes, there would be a absolute\nprohibition on any way for any individual to associate\nwith a campaign through a contribution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would also prevent\nthe candidate himself from expending his entire\nfortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he\nshould be elected --\nMR. BOPP: Yes, that is true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- think that's okay.\nMR. BOPP: And -- and in the record below,\nplaintiff Donald Brunelle said that he was prepared to\nspend considerable sums in support of his State Senate\nelection, which -- and considerable sums above the\nexpenditure limits that were before -- that were\nadopted by Vermont. So the -- the question is an\nindependent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which raises no possibility\nof corruption.\nMR. BOPP: Well, nor -- nor on fund raising\nusing up your time because all a wealthy person has to\ndo is write a check. And -- and, of course, in\nVermont, they even have an exception for not only just\nthe wealthy -- wealthy candidate, but the wealthy\nfamily. So, you know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean\nthey have an exception for the wealthy family.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. To a third degree of\nconsanguinity, people who are related to you to that\ndegree are not subject to the contribution limit. So,\nyou know, it's hard to justify Vermont's scheme if\nyou're concerned about the influence of the wealthy\nbecause they're giving the wealthy carte blanche to\nfund their own campaigns, even under these limits. So\na wealthy person who runs for Governor -- he has no\nfund raising costs. So -- and -- and he can get\ncontributions from others that are related by blood,\nbut not by marriage, interestingly, to -- to him. So\nthe public funding or the expenditures by -- by the\nwealthy neither give rise to -- and both solve --\neither don't give rise or solve the problems that they\nclaim.\nSo there's -- there's -- you don't need a\nremand to consider that -- that question, and that is\none of the questions that the Second Circuit has asked\nthat -- that the matter be remanded for.\nNow, in addition, the expenditure and\ncontribution limits here are not going to allow even\neffective campaigns. We have considerable evidence in\nthe record that to run an effective campaign for\nGovernor in Vermont, it takes $600,000 to $800,000; for\nthe Senate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, may I ask you?\nYou keep -- the way you're discussing this case, one\nwould think that the trial court found there was an\nevidentiary insufficiency, but I thought, at least on\nthe contributions part, the trial court found that the\nevidence sufficed to justify those limits.\nMR. BOPP: They did, but erroneously, and I\n-- we believe that you have a responsibility to do an\nindependent examination of the record. For instance,\nthere was a finding by the district court that these\namounts were, quote, suspiciously large. Now, if you\nlook at the record and you look at the six individuals\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what\namounts were suspiciously large?\nMR. BOPP: The contribution limits -- amounts\nover the contribution limits for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you point\nto the place in the district court opinion that you're\nreferring to?\nMR. BOPP: I am sorry. I do not have that in\nfront of me. That the district court found that the\namounts prohibited under the contribution limits by\nVermont were, quote, suspiciously large, and then they\ncited six different witnesses. We have reviewed each\n-- in our reply, each one of those witnesses, and it is\nsimply not true that any of them said that it was\nsuspiciously large, that is, that if there was any\nrelationship between contributions between the old\nlimits of $1,000 per election and these new, much --\nmuch lower limits, if there was any -- any witness\nrelated contributions of that size to any threat of\ncorruption. In fact, in the examples that are given,\nthey disclaim that there was any -- that anybody was\nbought or influenced in any way by the contributions\nthat were made.\nNow, the -- in terms of an effective\ncampaign, of course, under Shrink if a expenditure --\nif a contribution limit amounts to an expenditure limit\n-- and the Court commented on this. This Court\ncommented on this in -- in Citizens Against Rent\nControl v. Berkeley. If a contribution limit acts as\nan expenditure limit, then it can -- it will be also be\nstruck down if the candidates cannot mount effective\ncampaigns.\nAnd here we have demonstrated in the record\nwhat an effective campaign amounts to, and the amounts\neven for the House district of $2,000 would be simply\nused up by 1 brochure, 100 yard signs, and 1 postcard\nmailing. All of these have been valued in the record,\nand that would amount to $1,500 to $2,000, almost the\nentire amount allowed, not allowing even one mailing to\nall voters in -- in that House district.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Sorrell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. SORRELL\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS SORRELL, ET AL.\nMR. SORRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you,\nand may it please the Court:\nJustice Kennedy, you raised the issue of\nwhether money buys access. It clearly does. Our\nGovernor admitted that in a State of the State address.\nBut we also had testimony at trial from a former\nstatewide officeholder that money, of course, buys\naccess, but on the bad days, it buys influence. And we\nhad the President --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. SORRELL: -- of the Senate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you -- you\nsay in your brief -- I'm reading from page 13 -- that\nthe record convincingly shows that the ties among donor\ngroups and elected officials often determine the\npositions officials take. Can you give me an example\nof an official who took a position because of the ties\nto donor groups?\nMR. SORRELL: The -- there was testimony that\nthe President of the Senate said to another Senator who\nwas testifying at trial, we've lost the drug money.\nI'm not willing to lose the food manufacturer money, so\nI'm not going to sign this bill. That same President\nof the Senate testified in a legislative hearing -- I\n-- he admitted that he makes decisions in performing\nhis legislative duties because of that whole lot of\nmoney that he had collected in the year before.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nthat that official's official positions were determined\nby the donor groups, as you say in your brief.\nMR. SORRELL: Influenced and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your brief says\ndetermined. And did -- did you --\nMR. SORRELL: Have an influence and we would\nsuggest an undue influence in some cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it should say\ninfluenced rather than determined.\nMR. SORRELL: We didn't have anyone, as\nJustice Scalia asked, who stood up and admitted to\nhaving taken bribes. We did have the Senator, who was\nthe chair of the Senate Finance Committee, who said\nthat she's not in favor of tax credits, but she had a\ndonor to her campaign who had given $500 in one\ncampaign cycle and $1,000 in another cycle, and she\nallowed a tax credit to go through her taxing\ncommittee, even though substantively she didn't like\ntax credits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many prosecutions\nfor political corruption have you brought?\nMR. SORRELL: We have not had any of\nlegislators or statewide officers that I'm aware of.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that\npolitical corruption in Vermont is a serious problem?\nMR. SORRELL: It is a serious problem. Over\n70 percent of Vermonters at -- there was testimony at\ntrial from an expert that over 70 percent of Vermonters\nbelieved that corporate interests and wealthy\nindividuals have an undue influence on politics in the\nState, and I think 73 percent believe that the average\ncitizen --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe\nyour State as a clean State politically or as a corrupt\none?\nMR. SORRELL: We have a real problem in\nVermont. We haven't had a Governor go to prison. We\nhaven't had legislators tearfully apologizing for\nhaving taken bribes, facing an indictment the next day.\nBut we have got a problem in Vermont. In over 65\nhearings before our legislature and then through a 10-\nday trial, we established that as the trial court said,\nthe threat of corruption in Vermont is far from\nillusory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To the extent that Vermont\nlegislators can be bought off by $51?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SORRELL: There's nothing in the record\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's very sad.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the limit you've\nplaced on -- on contributions.\nMR. SORRELL: I -- no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the -- you know, if\n-- if you accept more than $51, you're -- you're likely\nto have your vote determined by that.\nMR. SORRELL: No, I -- we don't suggest -- we\ndon't suggest that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then why -- why the $50\nlimit? It certainly isn't based on the corruption --\nMR. SORRELL: I don't know what $50 limit you\nare talking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's thinking in --\nhe sometimes thinks in the past. He's --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's translated it into 1974\nor '72 real dollars.\nMR. SORRELL: Oh, it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's $200. The same\nquestion or $201.\nMR. SORRELL: It's the math.\nThe reality is that these contribution limits\nthat we had -- we had examples under the old\ncontribution limits. Even Petitioner Randall admitted\nthat in Vermont, a $1,000 contribution -- if you\nreceive a $1,000 contribution in Vermont -- this is one\nof the petitioners -- then Vermonters think that you've\nbeen bought. And that's the reality --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can -- and\npresumably they act accordingly at the polls. If they\nthink someone has been bought, I assume they don't\nreelect the person.\nMR. SORRELL: The Buckley court thought that\ndisclosure obligations and contribution limits alone\nwould be -- would suffice to address corruption and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I have the same question\nJustice Scalia had. I mean, the -- the question is you\n-- you have limits here of $100 per election. It's\n$200 per cycle.\nMR. SORRELL: For a House race, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: For a House. $300 for the\nSenate, $400 for a candidate for statewide office,\nincluding the Governor. That's $200 for an election\nfor Governor. You throw in contributions in kind. You\nsay that the political parties themselves cannot give\nmore than that $200 for an election for the Governor.\nIf we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just\nthe numbers Justice Scalia mentioned, and I would like\nto know why are they -- why does not give incumbents a\ntremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent\nplus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of\nspending as a challenger. In other words, why aren't\nthese limits far too low?\nMR. SORRELL: Incumbents had a much more of\nan advantage in the pre-Act 64 world. They could raise\nmore money and spend more money than --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not going to help to\nsay incumbents had a bigger advantage before. That is,\nthe question is, what we're interested in is -- at\nleast what I've written that I'm interested in, is at\nwhat point do these become so low that they really, as\na significant matter, shut off the possibility of a\nchallenge. And from that point of view, your numbers,\nwhich do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive\ndistrict, and your numbers, which do not explain all\nthe problems that Judge Winter had with these things,\ndo not help. That's why I'm asking you the question.\nMR. SORRELL: Vermont has the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want your answer.\nMR. SORRELL: Vermont has the second lowest\ngubernatorial spending in the country. In the record\nit shows that in the largest urban area in the State,\nin the Burlington area, you can buy three 30-second TV\nads in prime time on tier one cable for $45.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about the\nexpenditure. I'm talking about the contribution\nlimits. I and my friends have the following thought.\nWe don't know who the candidates for State rep are, but\nwe want a Republican slate or we want a Democratic\nslate. So we get all our $5 together, give them to the\nDemocratic Party or the Republican Party in Vermont,\nand lo and behold, that party cannot give more than\n$100 in an election to a State rep, et cetera.\nNow, to the -- to the ear, that sounds as if\na challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that\nwants to challenge is going to have a really tough\ntime. So I want you to explain it.\nMR. SORRELL: The extensive record below\nshows that with these contribution limits, attacking\nthe corruption and the appearance of corruption issue,\nthe candidates can amass the resources necessary to run\neffective campaigns at all levels.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It shows that on average.\nIt doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is\nwhere the -- where the shoe pinches.\nMR. SORRELL: The -- the reality is that --\nthat in virtually all classes of races, other than the\nsingle-member Senate races, that average spending was\nbelow these expenditure limits, and these include\ncontested cases with primaries, without.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's just what I said.\nYour figures show that the average spending is below,\nbut that's not what's significant. What's significant\nis what Justice Breyer posed, where -- where there is a\ncontested race and -- and some new candidate wants to\nunseat somebody who's been in there for years. That's\n-- that's where the shoe pinches.\nMR. SORRELL: And, Justice Scalia, under our\nlaw, the challenger can spend more than the incumbent\nbecause the incumbent has a lid not -- of 85 percent or\n90 percent of the expenditure limit, depending on\nwhether it's a legislative race or a -- or a statewide\nrace. But the -- the issue here is you're going to\nhave some -- some outliers.\nBut we have core constitutional interests in\ntrying to enhance the integrity of our campaigns. We\nhave this problem. The legislature reached a balance\nhere. It looked at what -- how much you would need to\nrun effective campaigns. It set --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in -- in any -- or in\nmany campaigns, the -- the issues take shape during the\nprocess of the campaign, and there are historical\nevents, national events that suddenly occur that people\nwant to comment on. And I -- I just don't see that\nthere's any capacity for adjusting so that the public\ncan know how candidates are facing issues that are\nbeginning to emerge that the public has a vital\ninterest in.\nMy understanding was that a quarter-page ad\nin the Burlington newspaper was, I think, $1,400. Now,\nit's -- it's gratifying to know that Vermonters are\nsplurging on cable television, but it -- it --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me that this\nis a highly restrictive rule insofar as having the\ncampaign be able to address the issues that the voters\nsay that they've become interested in.\nMR. SORRELL: We have the second lowest --\nsmallest legislative districts in the country, 4,000\ncitizens per single-member legislative district.\nSure, that's what it costs to take out an ad\nin the Free Press, but there's nothing in the record to\nshow that House candidates, legislative candidates,\ntake out those size ads in -- in the Burlington Free\nPress. The record is otherwise. The record reflects\nthat it's primarily door-to-door campaigning for\nlegislative races. If you're taking out an ad, it's in\n-- it's a flyer in one of the -- the weekly papers.\nPetitioner Donald Brunelle admitted that he ran a\ncompetitive race for the House, spending $1,000, that\nincluded yard signs, a mailing to his constituents, and\nflyer advertisements in -- in the newspaper.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did he have a primary?\nMR. SORRELL: I don't know whether he had a\nprimary or not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's another feature of --\nof this scheme that I find quite puzzling. You get the\nsame expenditure limit for the election cycle whether\nyou go through a primary or not. What an advantage\nthat is for the incumbent.\nMR. SORRELL: The -- there was testimony in\nthe record that those who have a primary might actually\nget a bump over others who are not challenged.\nBut as the district court pointed out, in\nVermont what makes Vermont different is that our\nprimary is late. It's the second Tuesday in September,\nand so it's less than 8 weeks from the general\nelection. It's not like having a primary in the\nspring.\nAnd as the legislature during those 65\nhearings considered the campaigning, they considered\nall kinds of campaigns, including contested primaries\nand not, and again, average spending in these campaigns\nwas, with minor exception of the single-member Senate\ndistricts, of which there are three -- that average\nspending was below these expenditure limits. So in the\naverage campaign, you could actually spend more than --\nthan on average is being spent.\nAnd the issue, when you've got competing\nconstitutional interests, is whether we address our\nproblems of corruption, appearance of corruption. We\ntry to free up candidates' and public officials' time\nfrom fund raising. We try to create competitive\nelections and bring more citizens into the process\nvoting, grassroots campaigning, and standing for\nelection. We want more people to run.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Sorrell, would you go\nback to the -- your comment on -- on average\nexpenditures? Do we know from the record how many of\nthe -- how many of the contests, on the basis of which\nthe average was calculated, were contests in which\nthere was a -- a contested primary?\nMR. SORRELL: We don't have that evidence in\nthe record. What we have is that we -- the experts\nlooked at total spending, which would include primary\nspending and general election spending, and our figures\nwent from that. And our expert, by the way, considered\nall races, even those for which campaign finance\nreports were not filed, meaning that the candidate\nhadn't raised or expended more than $500, and assumed\n$500 in spending in each one of those -- each one of\nthose races. So our average spending figures actually\nmight be a little higher than -- than reality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any testimony or\nevidence on the other side of the point that Judge\nWinter makes? That is, you have someone running in a\nprimary and then faces an incumbent in the general\nelection, but there's nothing left in the till because\nit was a hard-fought primary. That -- the advantage to\nthe incumbent in that situation was a large concern to\nat least some of the judges on the Second Circuit.\nMR. SORRELL: And that might be an issue that\non remand -- and this case is being remanded on a\ncouple of issues that aren't even before this Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not on the contributions,\nis it?\nMR. SORRELL: No, it's not on the\ncontributions, but it is going back to the court on\nissues of transfers of money from national parties to\nState parties and on whether related or coordinated\nexpenditures are, indeed, allowed to be an expenditure.\nSo the case is going back to the trial court on those\nbases anyway.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not going back on\nthe expenditure limit.\nMR. SORRELL: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, the problem, I mean,\nI was getting at and Justice Ginsburg is getting at,\nJudge Winter got at it. The -- the problem is -- is\nthe -- the total limitation on an election cycle,\nincluding the primary, when the primary involves a\nchallenge so that the challenger has an uphill fight\npresumably to start with in the primary. And if he's\ngoing to maintain an effective uphill fight in the\nprimary and he's lucky enough to win, he's going to get\nto the general election and he's going to be broke.\nThat's -- I mean, that's -- that's the problem that\nwe're concerned with.\nMR. SORRELL: That has not been a problem\nthat was reflected in the record either before the\nlegislature or at trial. This is a facial challenge\nfor the law, and you know, that situation of a primary\ncandidate who, for whatever reason, felt that he or she\nneeded to expend up to close to the expenditure limit\n-- it wouldn't be very prudent, but that could be an\nissue.\nBut, you know, we do not control independent\nexpenditures under our law, and we certainly don't\nlimit volunteer services. There's a tremendous amount\nof campaigning that can go on between a primary and a\ngeneral election even with a limited amount of funds\navailable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the burden is on the\ncandidate to establish that -- that somebody's\nexpenditure is independent and shouldn't be counted\nagainst his expenditure limit.\nMR. SORRELL: No. There is a presumption\nunder our law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A presumption, which means\nthe burden, to go forward and show the opposite, is on\nhim. Right?\nMR. SORRELL: Well, but it could be on the --\non the party because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the money that he spends\nin overcoming that presumption is charged against his\nexpenditure. Isn't that right?\nMR. SORRELL: No, Justice Scalia. The\nSecretary of State reached a -- issued an opinion that\nwe -- our office agrees with, that expenditures on\nattorneys for, you know, ballot access questions and\nthe like are not in furtherance of the candidacy and\nwould not apply against the expenditure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says the\nopposite. I'll ask them whether that's --\nMR. SORRELL: But the -- the Secretary of\nState's public opinion that we, the enforcement\nauthority, agree with is to the contrary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose the Vermont\ncourts could construe it more narrowly at some later\npoint. I would hate to rest the opinion on that.\nMR. SORRELL: The -- the -- under Vermont\nlaw, a presumption such -- such as this is not a burden\n-- creates no burden of persuasion, nor does it change\nthe burden of proof.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, I looked at\nyour -- the -- the references in your brief for that\nproposition, and I did not see them borne out. You\nreferred to a -- a footnote in the district court\nopinion which, in turn, refers to the remark of a\nsponsor of the amendment that -- that resulted in the\npresumption being in the law. And the only thing that\nwas attributed to the sponsor was that the presumption\nshould be regarded as rebuttable. The -- the footnote\nin the statement did not indicate that the presumption\nwas a disappearing presumption, once the other side\nwent forward with any evidence. So I don't see, based\non your -- your citations, that the presumption goes\naway simply by -- by one party going forward with\nevidence.\nMR. SORRELL: Well, if you -- if some entity\nthat has the burden of proof to show, in fact, that it\nwas a related or coordinated expenditure has the party\non the one hand and the candidate on the other saying,\nwe did not coordinate here, I didn't ask for it, I\ndidn't approve it, and then where is the evidence?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the point is what if\nwe don't have that simple of a situation.\nLet -- let me ask you this. Maybe we can\nshort-circuit this. I mean, do you represent as an --\nas a statement of Vermont law that this Court should\ndecide the case on the assumption that the presumption\nis a disappearing presumption, once evidence is offered\nagainst it?\nMR. SORRELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SORRELL: Well, credible evidence, yes.\nYes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is an affidavit\nfrom the candidate enough credible evidence in your\nview?\nMR. SORRELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And thereafter, all the --\nall the candidate has to say is in an affidavit, no, it\nwasn't coordinated, and then the burden is on the State\nto show that it was.\nMR. SORRELL: If the State is the party\nthat's trying to prove that it was, in fact, a\ncoordinated expenditure, under the law -- it would\ntypically be a opposing candidate who tries to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, the opposing candidate\nor the State.\nMR. SORRELL: So Justice Brandeis said that\nthere's room under our system for a courageous State to\nexperiment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just can I ask a technical\nquestion here?\nMR. SORRELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just -- is -- is it the case\nor not the case that if I contribute my car to drive\nthe candidate for Governor, let's say, between\nBurlington and Montpelier, and I buy the gas, does that\ncount against the limit? Yes or no. I'm a volunteer\nand I buy gas and drive him back and forth.\nMR. SORRELL: Yes, you drive. Then the\nanswer is no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. He drives.\nMR. SORRELL: Well, but it's your car, you're\nthere. No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not there. I lent\nhim the car.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the idea. If\nhe does -- if I do, it's not.\nWhat about I have a coffee -- coffee. I\nwanted to get the line. I see it. Coffee. I want to\nhave coffee and donuts, free donuts because -- and\ncoffee for people to come in. Is that counted or not?\nMR. SORRELL: As long as it's under $100.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's $200. Coffee\nand donuts are expensive.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Count it or not?\nMR. SORRELL: We don't -- our coffee is not\nthat expensive, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Donuts and coffee. In other\nwords, it counts as long as it's over $100.\nMR. SORRELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Under $100. Under $100.\nMR. SORRELL: No. Over $100 counts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Counts.\nMR. SORRELL: Under $100, it does not.\nMy time is expired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SORRELL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Wright.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA WRIGHT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nVERMONT PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP\nMS. WRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to return to a question that Justice\nKennedy asked earlier about why, if there are examples\nof corruption that the public becomes aware of, why the\npublic doesn't respond simply by voting the individual\nout of office. And I think it's important to point out\nthat some of the most serious examples of corruption on\nthis record or of the undue influence achieved by\nmonetary concerns were not examples that ever became\npublic except in the course of the trial of this case\nwhen we had witnesses come forward to testify about\nsome of their own personal experiences in the\nlegislature. By the very nature of the problem of\ncandidates becoming unduly beholden to the interests\nthat can provide the greatest sums for their campaigns,\nthose kinds of incidents are not going to typically be\na matter of discussion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I -- I thought that\nthe point was that the public mistrusts their\nrepresentatives because of large donations, and I\nthought the point being made was, well, if that's the\ncase and the public sees that this fellow has gotten a\n$10,000 donation, the public will say this -- this\nfellow is in that -- is in that corporation's or that\nperson's pocket.\nMS. WRIGHT: But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I won't vote for that\nperson. You -- you don't have to show that -- out of\nthe mouth of the candidate, that -- that he voted for\nthe bill because he got $10,000. The mere fact that\nit's on the public record that he got $10,000, if -- if\nwhat you say is correct, that -- that people are\nworried about, the -- the corruptive effect of such\ndonations, people should logically vote against that\ncandidate who accepts so much money.\nMS. WRIGHT: Two points on that, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, the problem of holding candidates\naccountable in that manner is greatly exacerbated when\nyou have a system of unlimited spending in which all of\nthe candidates involved feel compelled to go out and\nraise as much as they can in order to forestall the\npossibility of being outspent. Then when a voter says,\nwell, why are you doing this, the candidate has a\nready-made answer. If I don't do this -- you know,\nmaybe I'd rather not, but if I don't, I'm going to be\nbested in the fund-raising arms race. And voters\nreluctantly have come to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought --\nMS. WRIGHT: -- understand that that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- when you look at\nthe -- the record, Vermont would be the last place that\nyou'd be worried about it. The political culture, as\nwe just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door,\nand that's what the Vermonters expect. And it doesn't\ntake an arms race to get on your feet and go door to\ndoor. And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma\non the respondents' side of the case between justifying\nlow limits by saying you don't really need money to run\neffectively and at the same time suggesting that\nthere's a serious problem with too much money.\nMS. WRIGHT: Well, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is it?\nMS. WRIGHT: -- what we do have is candidates\n-- even though it is possible to run effective\ncampaigns in Vermont for lower amounts, candidates\nnevertheless go out and raise often much more than what\nthey need. Here's an example from the record. We had\nSenate candidate Vincent Illuzzi. In 1998, he raised\n$39,000, almost $40,000, for his Senate campaign. His\nchallenger was able to raise almost nothing. He only\nspent $30,000 worth of that. Candidates don't need\n$39,000 or $30,000 to run an effective Senate campaign,\nbut an incumbent that builds a war chest has the\nability to deter serious challenges.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could candidates --\nJUSTICE BREYER: On your question -- the --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could candidates run\neffective campaigns if there were no -- with these\ncontribution limits if there were no expenditure\nlimits?\nMS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. The -- we\nbelieve the record strongly shows that. For example,\nthere was a mayoral election in Burlington run under\nthese limits during the time that the case was --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. I mean, if there were no\nexpenditure limits, if candidates could expend as much\nas they want, could they raise enough money with these\ncontribution limits --\nMS. WRIGHT: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- to run effective\ncampaigns.\nMS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor, because this\nBurlington mayor's race, as an example, was one in\nwhich there was no limit on -- on spending, and both\ncandidates were able to raise amounts either similar to\nwhat they had raised in the past or at least amounts\nthat met the campaign budget that they had sought to --\nto follow.\nI think in looking at the level of the\ncontribution limits, it's important again to understand\nthe scale of politics in Vermont. If we want to\ncompare them to Missouri, a $2,000 limit for a\ngubernatorial race in Missouri was approved by this\nCourt, and in Missouri you had an election in 2000\nwhere each candidate was spending $8 million or $9\nmillion in a gubernatorial race. I mean, that compares\nvery directly if you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the --\nMS. WRIGHT: -- did the same ratio for\nVermont. Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wasn't it the State auditor?\nMS. WRIGHT: Not the $8 million or $9\nmillion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I know, but didn't we\nhave in front of us a limit, which I wrote was rather\nborder, that involved a State auditor campaign?\nMS. WRIGHT: In Missouri?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought so, in Shrink\nMissouri.\nMS. WRIGHT: It may have been the State\nauditor, but it also the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is not quite the same\npolitical volatility perhaps, but --\nMS. WRIGHT: No, but the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have a different question\nI'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed\nyet. On the expenditure limits, there is a case,\nBuckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that\nexpenditure limits are not constitutional. Now,\nwhether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am\nI not bound by that?\nAnd insofar as you try to distinguish it,\nyou've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts\nto distinguish it. And therefore, I'd like to hear why\nyou think I'm not bound by a past precedent in an\nimportant matter, with which I may or may not have\nagreed at the time.\nMS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. We believe\nexpenditure limits can be upheld without overruling\nBuckley v. Valeo, and that's for several reasons.\nFirst, Buckley created a rule of exacting\nscrutiny that applies to expenditure limits. That is\nnot a rule of automatic invalidation.\nAnd very importantly, when Buckley declared\nthat the interest in deterring corruption and its\nappearance was not adequate to support the expenditure\nlimits, that was on a record in which neither spending\nnor contributions had been subject to meaningful limits\nprior to the time of FECA and the amendments that the\nCourt was considering. There simply was no record to\nshow the Court of how contribution limits alone would\nreally work to address the problem of corruption and\nthe appearance of -- of corruption and encouraging\npublic confidence in government. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought what\nthat case said and what many of our other cases say,\nwith regard to expenditures in particular, is that\nyou're not talking about money here. You're talking\nabout speech. So long as all that money is going to\ncampaigning, you're talking about speech.\nAnd when you say you don't need any more\nspeech than this, that's a very odd thing for -- for a\n-- a United States Government to say. Enough speech.\nYou don't need any more than this. And that's the\nreason the expenditure limits, as opposed to\ncontribution limits, were regarded quite differently in\nBuckley and I think should still be regarded\ndifferently today. You're constraining speech. It's\nnot money you're constraining. Contribution limits,\nyou're constraining money, but when you say you can't\nexpend more than this on your campaign, you're saying,\nno, no, no, this is enough speech. We're going to --\nwe, the State, are going to tell you how much you\nshould campaign. That's very unusual in -- in American\ndemocracy.\nMS. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I think that's\ncertainly why Buckley applied exacting scrutiny. But I\nthink what Vermont understood is that political\nspending has inescapably a dual character. Yes,\ncampaign spending enables many forms of speech, but it\nalso has another side because higher and higher levels\nof campaign spending result in candidates who are\nbeholden to the constituencies that can provide the\ngreatest amounts of funds for their campaigns. And\nwhat you end up with, the consequence, is legislators\nwho say, you know, I've lost the drug money and I can't\nafford to lose the food manufacturer money --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Limit the contributions.\nMS. WRIGHT: -- so I'm not going to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That solves that problem.\nLimit the contributions.\nMS. WRIGHT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you want to limit\nexpenditures, even if it's the person's own money. No\npossibility of corruption. You're saying, no, this is\nenough speech. We don't want to hear any more from\nyou. We, the State, will tell you how much campaigning\nis enough. That's extraordinary.\nMS. WRIGHT: Because the -- the interests\nthat Vermont is seeking to serve are fundamental to the\ncore functions of government, preserving the quality of\nrepresentative government, preserving the integrity of\ngovernment, assuring the public that its officeholders\ncan act in the best interests of the public and make\ndecisions on the merits, not simply based on their need\nfor campaign cash.\nAnd this question of accountability that's so\nimportant is tied to the ability to say, I've -- I've\nmet my spending limits, I've raised all that I need to\n-- to raise. If somebody comes to me with\ncontributions from a source that I don't feel\ncomfortable taking, I can turn that down without\nsuffering a tremendous competitive disadvantage.\nI think one of the other key features of the\nexpenditure limits that Vermont seeks to impose here is\nthat they will do so much to encourage competitive\ncampaigns. We had a record in Vermont that showed that\nfor the previous nine election cycles before the act\nwas enacted, only one incumbent had been defeated for a\nstatewide office. In the meantime, in the City of\nAlbuquerque where they had spending limits for 25\nyears, every challenger who came out to challenge an\nincumbent mayor was successful. No one can say on that\nrecord that spending limits would do anything but to\nenhance competition.\nIn the -- one of the other interests that I\nwould like to turn to, before we close, is Vermont's\ninterest in protecting the time of officeholders from\nthe burdens and distractions of fund raising. We had a\nrecord in which seasoned politicians in Vermont were\nsaying that candidates for office, even in Vermont,\nwere spending as much time begging for funds as they do\ncampaigning. We had a record in which a Senator\nreported leaving the floor of the Senate during a floor\ndebate to take a call from a donor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do\nyou police that, though? Because an incumbent can --\nhas so many opportunities to go before the public that\nwouldn't necessarily be categorized as campaigning but\nas part of his or her official duties, while everything\na challenger does is going to be credited against his\naccount.\nMS. WRIGHT: Well, Your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer the\nquestion.\nMS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor.\nWe believe that under almost any system,\nincumbents are going to still have advantages and no\ncampaign finance system can fully address that. But we\nbelieve that if the challenger now has the ability to\noutspend the incumbent and the incumbent doesn't have\nthat additional advantage of being able to outspend the\nchallenger, as is most often the case, then competition\ncan only be enhanced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nIN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530\nMR. BOPP: Thank you.\nThe one example that they keep going back to\nregarding the President of the Senate tells the breadth\nof this challenge. As long as Vermont allows periodic\nelections, incumbents are going to consider the effect\nthat their votes have on future elections. And -- and\nwhile it makes it more scandalous to say we will lose\nthe food manufacturers' money, what they are concerned\nabout is losing the food manufacturers' support. So as\n-- if this the definition of corruption, it is\nsufficient now to -- for the State of Vermont to\nabolish elections generally.\nNow, secondly, as to the effect on\nchallengers, the record demonstrates that challengers\n-- and there's expert testimony to the fact that\nchallengers are more frequently challenged in primaries\nthan are incumbents, and the Randall brief on pages 16\nand 17 point out the testimony of people who have been\nsubject to a primary and demonstrates that they are not\nable to mount an effective campaign in the general.\nFurthermore, the expenditure limits have the\nperverse result of depriving challengers of more money\nthan incumbents, probably making them attractive to\nincumbents. In the Senate, for instance, incumbents\nwould be deprived of 20 percent of their total\nresources, while challengers would be deprived of 36\npercent of their total resources.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how that\ncomes. How does that come about?\nMR. BOPP: It comes about because challengers\nfrequently in Vermont actually spend more than do\nincumbents. I -- I know that -- that the general\nperception is the opposite, but the general perception\nis not true in Vermont. And -- and that points to the\n-- the fact that the way this law is constructed\nstrongly suggests that is -- it is seeking to favor\nincumbents.\nFurthermore, we had expert witness testimony\non the effect of contribution limits on competitive\nraces. The -- we had -- Mr. McNeil testified in\nexamining the competitive races in the 1998 election\nthat the vast majority in both the House and the Senate\nwould not be able to mount an effective campaign with\nthe available resources that would have been available\nafter imposing the contribution limits. And, of\ncourse, these were in the amounts of 28 percent in the\nSenate, 22 percent in the House, which is way beyond\nthe 5.1 percent that this Court in Buckley thought that\ncould be made up by the imposition of a $1,000 limit.\nI mean, this -- this law is so constructed\nthat it would make it virtually impossible for, for\ninstance, countywide candidates in Chittenden County, a\ncounty of 150,000, the largest county in Vermont --\nthey would be limited to $4,000 for the primary and the\ngeneral election. That's 3 cents for each person in\nChittenden County. And, of course, this is an\nimportant county. Senator Leahy came from that county\nas State's attorney and became the United States\nSenator.\nAnd finally, with respect to the rebuttable\npresumption, actually the -- the statute answers the\nquestion of whether or not this presumption disappears.\nIf you look at 2809, subsection (e), the last sentence\nsays, the findings and determination of the court --\nand this is in this court proceeding by your opponent\nthat is trying to claim that this spending over here is\nactually yours -- that the findings and the\ndetermination of the court shall be prima facie\nevidence in any proceeding brought for violation of the\nchapter. So it doesn't go away. The rebuttable\npresumption never goes away. And, in fact, each person\n-- each candidate and each independent spender can look\nat the rebuttable presumption requirement and say, I\nhave to file a report and that governs my report.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
