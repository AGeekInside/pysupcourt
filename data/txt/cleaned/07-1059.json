Eurodif.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nIN NO. 07-1059\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is\nwhether the provision of enriched uranium under\nseparative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the\nFederal antidumping duty law. The resolution of that\nquestion turns on whether the performance of SWU\ncontracts results in merchandise being sold in the\nUnited States. The Department of Commerce, which is the\nFederal agency entrusted by Congress with the\nadministration of the antidumping duty law, concluded\nafter an extensive investigation that SWU contracts do\nresult in sales of enriched uranium. That determination\nwas reasonable and should be sustained by this Court.\nNow, the fundamental bargain in a SWU\ncontract is that the customer, the utility, provides a\ncombination of feedstock or feed uranium plus cash, and\nreceives in return a specified quantity and assay of\nenriched uranium, and by \"assay\" I mean the percentage\nof weight of U-235 within the final product. Now, the\ncustomer has discretion to choose among varying\ncombinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete\nthe transaction for a particular quantity and assay of\nenriched uranium; but the enricher has its own\ndiscretion. That is, having received the consideration\npaid by the utility, the enricher is free to make its\nown determination based on economic considerations as to\nthe relative proportions of feedstocks and SWUs that\nshould be used to make a given quantity of enriched\nuranium.\nSo the overall -- the character of the\noverall transaction is comfortably characterized as a\nsale, because it involves the acquisition by the utility\nof a product, merchandise, that it didn't own at the\noutset of the transaction in exchange for consideration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can imagine you could\nhave a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain\nabsolute identical one to the other. And the farmer\ntakes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he\ndrives away with the grain, milled. Now, it may make no\ndifference to anybody whether the identical molecules\nare the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they\nare processing it; they are not buying and selling it.\nMR. STEWART: Well, indeed, as we've\nexplained in our opening brief, at common law the\ndistinction between a bailment and a sale in that type\nof circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the\nequivalent processor was under an obligation to return\nthe very same thing in processed form. And if that\nwas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are saying if we have\nthat, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some\nfarmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be\nmilled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they\ncome back, and it -- you know, it may not be the\nidentical molecule, but it's identically the same; they\nhave done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the\nCommerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and\nthe antidumping statutes apply?\nMR. STEWART: We are saying that Commerce\ncould treat it as a sale. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, would it or not?\nMR. STEWART: I think Commerce in that\nhypothetical -- again, if we were talking about grain\nbeing provided by the customer to a miller overseas --\noverseas, and then the finished product being brought\nback into this country, I think the logic of the\nCommerce determination here would suggest that it would\nbe a sale.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you, and I\njust wonder, what I would like to know, is if any\nbusinessman involved in any of these or related things\nbefore this decision of the Commerce Department would\nhave thought that that is how the Commerce Department\nwould have treated such a transaction?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I don't think that\nCommerce had before this incident dealt with exactly\nthis type of situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but common law would\nhave treated it that way, you say?\nMR. STEWART: Common law would have treated\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's pretty good\nauthority.\nMR. STEWART: It certainly suggests that\nCommerce could permissibly treat it as a sale.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. I'm\nasking -- the question is the same as the last case, to\nme: Not whether they could have done it; sure they\ncould have done it. My question is based on my question\nof whether they had a rule that any reasonable person\nwould have thought that is how they treated it --\nMR. STEWART: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because after all, you have\nthree precedents in related areas, not the direct area\nbut in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't\nhave treated the millers that way.\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure exactly which\nprecedents you mean. If -- the one that is -- the\nadministrative determination that is cited most\nfrequently is SRAMS from Taiwan, in which the design\nhouse provided, I believe it was a design mask to the\nfoundry, and the foundry manufactured the finished\nequipment and in concluding that it was the design house\nrather than the foundry that was properly treated as the\nproducer of the goods, the Commerce Department relied in\npart on the fact that the design house had intellectual\nproperty rights in the design mask.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know what, I'm thinking\nof those things, they're something called \"tollers.\" I\ndon't know exactly what tollers are. They seem to be\nlike people who give haircuts. They're sort of\nservicers of some kind. They're talking about tollers\nand -- and subcontractors. And that is a related area.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And the SRAMs\ncases is one of the toller or subcontractor cases. And\nthe Department of Commerce relied in part on the fact\nthat the design house had intellectual property rights\nin the design mask. So it was not fungible property, it\nwas not an input that the foundry could have gotten from\nanother source.\nThe other thing we would say about the grain\nhypothetical is that when you hear about the farmer\nproviding grain to the miller or the utilities providing\nfeedstock to the enrichers, it may conjure up images of\na tangible good that is in the physical possession of\nthe farmer or the utility that is then physically\ntransferred to the enricher. In the case of the miller\nthat is correct.\nBut the way that a utility provides\nfeedstock to an enricher is not by taking physical\npossession of the feedstock and then by transporting it.\nRather, the utility simply makes financial arrangements\nwith the supplier of feedstock, basically cuts a check\nor transfers funds --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I ask a\nquestion about the scope of discretion involved here?\nAssume the facts were not exactly as they are here, it\nis not a fungible product, but that each shipment was\nseparately identified and each shipment was processed as\na different batch in France and then sent back. That I\nassume would not normally be treated as a sale of goods?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think that Commerce's\ndetermination suggests, without squarely holding, that\nit would treat that as a sale of goods because it would\ninvolve substantial transformation of the original item.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's really what I\nwanted to ask you. Even if the facts were more extreme,\njust as in the example I gave, do you think the Commerce\nDepartment would have discretion to treat that as a sale\nof goods?\nMR. STEWART: We do. And I think it's\nimportant, to carry on with the thought I was sketching\nout previously about the way in which the raw materials\nare provided to the enricher.\nIf you imagine my buying a suit from a\ntailor, and the tailor says: The price is $600; $300 of\nthat accounts for the cost of the cloth; $300 is the\nlabor that's involved in sewing it into a suit.\nClearly, that's a sale of merchandise, even though the\nprice has been broken up --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then supposing they\nsend the suit back to a different person for\nalterations, and they say, well, this is part of the\nsale, so we want to treat it as a sale of goods?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the alterations would\njust be a finishing process and that wouldn't involve\nsubstantial --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the difference\nbetween that and what we've got here?\nMR. STEWART: But the point I was going to\nmake about the suit, and it applies equally to the\nuranium enrichment process, is if I say to my tailor,\nrather than I pay you $600 and you pay your cloth\nsupplier $300, how about I just give you $300 and I will\ngive $300 to your cloth supplier, and it will amount to\nthe same thing in the end, because you won't have to pay\nfor the cloth? If the tailor accepts that arrangement,\nthe economic substance is exactly the same. And it\nwould seem strange to say that it's a sale if I just pay\n$600 to the tailor, but it's not a sale if I break down\nthe cost in the way that I've described.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you articulate\nprecisely what your test is, because you have been going\nback and forth between whether the raw materials are\nfungible and whether there is a fundamental\ntransformation in the product? So, how would you merge\nthose two in an articulable test so that business people\ncan know when they are going to be subject to this\nregime and when they were not?\nMR. STEWART: I think that the Commerce\ndetermination -- that Commerce did not purport to either\npromulgate a regulation or announce a test that\nprecisely defined the term \"sale\". I think the thrust\nof the Commerce Department's determination was that\nsubstantial transformation was enough, but that the case\nwas much easier by virtue of the fact that the\nproducer -- the enricher dealt with fungible goods and\nalso had substantial discretion to decide how much of\nthe feedstock would be used vis-a-vis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would say your\nultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial\ntransformation, and whether it's a raw material or\ndiscretion, those go into that determination?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct, although it\nwould certainly be appropriate for this Court if it\ndidn't want to address the situation in which only\nsubstantial transformation was present, to say that at\nleast when both circumstances were present there was a\nsale.\nAnd again, to distinguish this somewhat from\nthe miller hypothetical, the miller in making grain into\nflour may have discretion as to which individual grains\nto use for a particular batch of flour, but it won't\ntypically have discretion as to what weight of grain\nwill be used to make what weight of flour. And the\nenricher has that discretion as well; that is, to\nproduce a particular quantity and assay of enriched\nuranium, the enricher can either use more feedstock and\nfewer SWU's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's a SWU? You lost me\non the SWU. What's a SWU?\nMR. STEWART: A SWU is a unit of work and\nit's work in the sense of output; that is, it is the\nwork necessary to separate out a particular quantity of\nenriched uranium --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you put in more time\nwith the uranium, with the same amount of 235, if you\nput in more time you can get out more?\nMR. STEWART: That's right. The amount\nof -- the separation process or the enrichment process\ninvolves a separation of the original feedstock into the\nenriched uranium and what is referred to as the tails,\nwhich is the residue or the depleted uranium.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure you're\nprepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals. What\nabout a diamond? You have a chunk of rock that contains\na diamond. You send it to Antwerp and they carve it\naway into something that, I guess you could say it's\nbeen substantially transformed. It's not just a rock.\nIt's now a glittering diamond. Is that covered by --\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure whether Commerce\nwould treat that as substantial transformation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Neither am I, and\nit's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern. It's a\nfluctuating test that is hard to determine how it's\ngoing to be applied in a wide variety of cases.\nMR. STEWART: Now, in this case -- in this\nparticular case, Commerce noted that there was no\ndispute among the parties that the enrichment process\ndid result in substantial transformation. So that --\nthat uncertainly is not present here.\nBut I agree that there is a gray area with\nrespect to substantial transformation that isn't present\nwhen you are trying to answer the question: Is the\ncustomer getting back the same thing in modified form or\nis he getting back a different thing? That is, although\nthe contracts between the utility and the enricher deem\nthe enriched uranium to have been produced with the\ncustomer's own feedstock, everybody acknowledges that\nthat is not the fact in the real world.\nAnd so, what the customer receives back is\nnot like your diamond hypothetical, in which he receives\nan improved version of the original product. It is as\nthough you had a diamond company that said, we need\ninventory all the time, and we're prepared to work out\nan arrangement where if you send us a raw diamond plus\ncash, we will send you back a different cut diamond.\nThat would be a sale, regardless of whether there was\nsubstantial transformation, because you would have\npayment of consideration for a product that you\nindisputably didn't own at the outset.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, we're\nreviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit. And the\nFederal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power\ncase in which the same issue was presented, albeit under\na different statute.\nBut I -- reading that Florida Power, where\nthe Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position,\nthe Government's position then was that this very same\ntransaction involved the rendition of services and not a\nsale of goods.\nDoes the Government have a distinction\nbetween those two cases, or are you now saying in\nhindsight you realized that the position that you took\nbefore the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think we have\ndisavowed the position we took in the Florida Power &\nLight case. Now, in all candor, I would have to say the\nquestion of the Contract Disputes -- Disputes Act's\napplicability to SWU contracts is of a lot less interest\nto the Federal Government now than it was then, because\nthe reason that arose in a case involving the Federal\nGovernment was that at that time USEC was a Government\ninstrumentality and we were representing USEC in its\ngovernmental incarnation.\nNow that USEC has been privatized, the\nFederal Circuit is unlikely to confront the question\nwhether the Contract Disputes Act applies to this sort\nof, because these are not -- this is not a Federal\nentity, in any event.\nThe reason that we think the two cases are\nreconcilable is that the Contract Disputes Act, as its\nname implies, is a statute that governs the resolution\nof disputes between contracting parties. And in that\nsituation, it's much more appropriate to look to the\nform of the parties' arrangement. And the court -- the\nFederal Circuit in Florida Power and Light placed a lot\nof emphasis on the fact that the contract was styled as\none for enrichment services. And that is an appropriate\nconsideration to take into account when you are\nresolving disputes between the contracting parties, but\nwhen the whole purpose of the antidumping statute is to\nprevent contracting parties from entering into\narrangements that are mutually beneficial to themselves,\nbut that would and unfairly disadvantage domestic\ncompetitors, it was appropriate for Commerce to look\nbehind the form of the contract and to look at physical\nand economic reality.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it correct that\nthe universe of transactions that is the subject of this\nAct is sales? Is that not right? Rather than service\ncontracts.\nMR. STEWART: Well, it is true that the\nantidumping statute requires that merchandise be sold in\nthe United States, and we don't contend that the statute\napplies to price discrimination in services like\ninsurance or banking.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you -- do you\ncontend the word \"sold\" is an ambiguous term, requires\nconstruction by a particular agency?\nMR. STEWART: It is ambiguous at the\nmargins; that is, the classic arrangement, the classic\nsale is an exchange of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think Congress\nintended the ambiguity to be resolved by an agency\nrather than judges applying the rules of common law and\nthe rules of sales law generally?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, and I think this is a\nstatute that has been around for, I believe, close to\n90 years now; and in order for it to remain efficacious\nin this area, Commerce has to be able to adapt its\nprinciples to new forms of transactions. Again, that\ndoesn't mean that Commerce's discretion is limitless,\nbut it has some discretion at the margins.\nIf I may, I would like to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\nMr. Farr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nIN NO. 07-1078\nMR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would submit, as the questions this\nmorning have indicated, one of the difficulties in this\ncase, obviously, is this is the kind of transaction that\ncan be thought about reasonably enough in different\nways. It is possible to look at this very narrow set of\ncircumstances where a customer is providing raw\nmaterials of the kind that the producer uses to make a\ngood, and to say in that circumstance we could look at\nit as the customer providing two kinds of consideration\nfor the good it's receiving; or we could look at it, as\nthe Respondents do and as the Federal Circuit did, as\nsaying, the other way to look at it is this is\nessentially the customer receiving a service on its own\ngoods.\nNow it seems to me to begin with, the\nquestion that is before the Court properly is whether\nCommerce, which is undoubtedly the agency charged with\nenforcing this statute, has adopted a reasonable view\nwhen it's taken one of those two positions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what do we do about\nthe question that is bothering me? Maybe at some\npoint -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I\nwill assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have\nthe power to classify it either way.\nWhat is bothering me, and maybe that's not\nin this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer\njust said, this statute has been around for 90 years.\nThere has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign\ncommerce during that time. Yet I don't find cited here\nany instance in which Commerce ever before said that\nwhen you have title to a good, and you send it abroad,\nfor even a big change in it, and then it comes back,\nthat that is a sale.\nNow, I might -- I don't know all the\nCommerce cases; maybe they did. But what I found here\nis like a blank on that side, and on the other side the\ntolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to\nthe point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a\nclient, and that client said if I keep title to the\ngood, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.\nMR. FARR: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now that's the -- the\nquestion I want responded to in the legal context of,\nhas Commerce made a significant change in its policy?\nMR. FARR: Several things about that,\nJustice Breyer. First of all, as we have indicated in\nour brief, Commerce did have a policy prior to the\ntolling regulation, where it did treat these kinds of\ntransactions as sales of goods.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I read -- at what page\ndo I find all these cases?\nMR. FARR: That is in our brief. I'm sorry,\nI don't have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, roughly. I'll find\nit. I will find it.\nMR. FARR: But it's in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I will see a lot of\ncases where --\nMR. FARR: Where we discuss Commerce's\ntolling precedent. And then it went and it essentially\ndecided that what it had done in that precedent, it\nwanted to reexamine that, because it thought in the end\nwhat was happening in all of those cases is there was a\nresale of the merchandise; and it thought it would be a\nbetter practice to focus on that sale of the merchandise\nfor purposes of applying the statute.\nWhen it did that, however, it found it had\ncreated a loophole in the case where there wasn't a\nfurther sale. So it has gone back to that. So at least\nin terms of the precedent, Commerce has been on\ndifferent sides of that, but they have been wrestling\nwith exactly the problem that I outlined at the\nbeginning, which is dealing with a question that\nessentially has no ready answer to it and trying to pick\namong the plausible answers that were available to it.\nSecondly, just about the specific situation\nhere, I don't believe that there is any chance that the\nutilities and the enricher in this case could claim\nunfair surprise or unjust reliance; because they say in\ntheir own briefs, they did not set their transactions up\nin this way in order to try to comply with prior\ndecisions of Commerce.\nThey say -- they make a point in their brief\nin saying we have perfectly innocent intentions here,\nthat they set their transactions up purely for\nhistorical and commercial reasons.\nSo -- now, the other question that\nJustice Breyer raises is about the cases, and\nJustice Ginsburg I think mentioned earlier the Florida\nPower & Light decision. And again, Florida Power &\nLight is a case in which there is no agency that is\nbefore the Court.\nSo at that point there is no question of\nChevron deference, no question of whether this is a\nreasonable position; all that the Court had to decide\nwas, given the possible choices, which did it think was\nthe better choice under those circumstances? And\nparticularly I think it's important in that case, is the\nFederal Circuit said, this is a case that doesn't fall\nreadily into either of the two categories. So it went\nahead and had to decide it on its own.\nBut it seems to me that when you say in a\ncase with an agency involved, and the agency has made\none determination, that a case could fall within either\nof categories -- of categories --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Farr, are there\nearlier cases that applied Chevron deference to the\nCommerce's determination of what a sale is?\nMR. FARR: No, there are not, Your Honor,\nthat I am aware of. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that the Chevron\ncase is not a substantial evidence case?\nMR. FARR: I do think so, although I must\nsay the line between the two is not enormously clear to\nme, to be honest. But -- but the fact is if I were\ntrying to figure out where on the side of the line it\ngoes, it seems to me that this is a case in which you\nare talking about the application of a legal standard to\na particular set of circumstances. I mean, in Chevron,\nyou have the situation, is a certain kind of facility a\nstationary source or whatever? I mean that -- you could\nsay, well, that is a factual question in some way, but\nit seems to me ultimately the better way to think about\nit is Commerce's responsibility is to interpret the law\nin the light of cases that come up.\nI mean, an agency does not -- is not\nexpected by Congress just to sit back and imagine all\nthe possible situations that could be a sale of\nmerchandise. I think what the agency is supposed to do\nis, confronted with the circumstance in a particular\ntransaction, to apply its judgment on the statutory\nlanguage and say, yes, we do think this is a sale of\nmerchandise or no, we don't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we are to defer\nto the agency's interpretation, what -- how would you\nphrase its interpretation, apart from \"this is a sale\"?\nMR. FARR: Well, I think -- the narrowest\ninterpretation, and it seems to me the one that is most\nreadily dealt with is, to say, in a situation where a\ncustomer provides raw material that is the type of, but\nnot the precise raw material, used by a manufacturer to\nmake the good that it then delivers to the customer, in\nthat situation, we are going to treat the manufacturer\nas having made a sale of that good for the consideration\nof the cash and the raw material.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter\nwhether there is a substantial transformation or not?\nMR. FARR: I think it does,\nMr. Chief Justice, in this sense, that we are talking\nabout the sale of the merchandise and that is a new\ngood. So the substantial transformation is essentially\nwhat moves the ball from -- from being the -- the raw\nmaterial supplied by the customer to something\ndifferent. And the question would be in this case,\ncould Commerce reasonably think that the manufacturer\nhad sufficient control over the new good to be deemed\nthe owner of that?\nAnd I think it's important to look, if you\nlook at the -- there are two different commodities that\nare being talked about in the case of this transaction:\nOne is the feedstock, the raw material; the other is the\nLEU. And the idea that the Respondents posit is, well,\nthis is just a service performed on our material. All\nwe are doing is getting our material back after a\nservice has been performed on it.\nBut as everybody agrees, as a matter of\nfact, that is simply not so. They are not getting their\nmaterial back with a service performed on it. They are\ngetting a product that has been produced, manufactured,\nfrom raw material that is fungible and in the general\ninventory of the manufacturer. And in that case, it\nseems to me, Commerce can say, we are going to disregard\nthe fiction of the parties' contracts that say this\nreally is made from our material, and say we are going\nto look at the actual nature of the transaction. And in\nthe actual nature of the transaction, as I said, it is\nnot made from their material.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that -- so that\nis the critical factor, whether it's made from their\nmaterial, regardless of whether there is a\ntransformation? If the domestic entity provides wood,\nwooden two-by-fours, and the foreign entity coats it in\na certain way, but they can use any two-by-fours, they\nare indistinguishable, you would say in that case\nthere's still -- that's still subject to Commerce's\nposition?\nMR. FARR: No, I don't think Commerce would\nsay that. I am to some extent speaking for them here.\nBut I think what Commerce would say is, when you have a\nfungible raw material in substantial transformation\nwithout --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's got to be\nboth?\nMR. FARR: I think that Commerce would say,\nif you have both, that clearly can be regarded as a sale\nof merchandise, and we will regard it as a sale of\nmerchandise. On the other hand, if you only have\nsubstantial transformation but not fungibility, then I\nbelieve Commerce would say, even in that situation,\nbecause it's ultimately the effect on the domestic\ncompetitor is exactly the same, we would retain the\ndiscretion to treat even that as a sale of merchandise.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you --\nMR. FARR: I would emphasize that's not the\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you do that if you\nthought it was clear as a matter of common law or under\nthe Uniform Sales Act, or something like that, that it\nwas not a sale?\nMR. FARR: I think because of the different\ncircumstances, under the common law, for example, I\nshould make very clear -- but I should make first my\nanswer to you, Justice Stevens. Under the common law,\nthe particular transaction we were dealing with here,\nwhere it is not made from the identical material, is\nclearly a sale under the common law. But if you -- if\nCommerce were going to say, in a situation where it is\nmade from the identical material, we want to depart from\nthe common law, I think they would have to justify that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under common law, you\ndon't need deference.\nMR. FARR: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. If it were\nclearly a sale under common law, you wouldn't need to\nrely on deference.\nMR. FARR: Well, in the end, I think, in the\ncommercial setting, there is a reasonable chance, not\nnecessarily certain because you do have the UCC and you\nhave the possibility, in those situations, the courts\nmight say, in a commercial setting, we are going to pay\nmore attention to the parties' efforts to structure\ntheir contracts in a particular way, so that between\nthem, we are going to treat the contract differently.\nAll our position is, is that Commerce, in applying the\nantidumping law to protect a third party doesn't have to\nobserve the fictions in the parties' contract.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FARR: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Halligan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start with Justice Breyer's\nquestion about the way in which the Department of\nCommerce has treated transactions for the processing of\ngoods and the uncertainty that their position in this\ncase will cause, not just in this industry but across\nindustries.\nAs you suggested, Justice Breyer -- you\nreferred to -- the Department of Commerce has treated\nprocessors who are called \"tollers\", in the language\nthat Commerce uses, as performing a service. And the\ntransaction for the sale of that service has not been\ntreated as a cognizable sale under the antidumping law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And those have been cases\nwhere the very same product is returned with value\nadded, right?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Not necessarily. Sometimes\nthat is the case, Your Honor, but not always. For\nexample, in the Taiwan Semiconductors case, which Mr.\nStewart referred to and which is cited in our brief,\nwhat the U.S. company provided was simply a design to\nfor a chip. The Taiwanese company, which was the\nprocessor in the case according to the Department of\nCommerce, manufactured the chip, provided the silica,\nused the design of the U.S. company, but no raw\nmaterials at all. The Department of Commerce, in its\nexplanation as to why it treated the sale for purposes\nof the antidumping law as the eventual sale by the U.S.\ncompany and did not and could not treat the sale by the\nprocessor as a cognizable sale, explained that the\nstatute itself requires Commerce to compare the U.S.\nprice, which is called the export price, the price at\nwhich a good is sold or imported into the United States,\nwith the price at which the product is sold in the\ncompany's home market. And because a processor does not\nand cannot either provide all the essential components\nof the product, because it's only providing the\nprocessing service and not the raw materials, and\nbecause it does not and cannot set the price at which\nthe product is sold in the United States, it is\ntherefore not the appropriate sale to look at that in\nterms of the antidumping statute. That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do about\nthe substance versus formality question? I mean, if you\ndo have fungible raw materials, why should it make a\ndifference whether the domestic company supplies those\nto the foreign company or simply says -- gives them\nmoney and says, buy them yourselves? And in the latter\ncase, you would say that's a sale, and in the former\ncase you would say it's not a sale?\nMS. HALLIGAN: First of all, the Department\nof Commerce has not until this case suggested that\nfungibility of goods might make some sort of a\ndifference. In fact, in one of the cases that we cite\nregarding flanges which were, according to the\nDepartment of Commerce, fungible, they concluded that\nthe processing service there was not the cognizable\nsale, the downstream sale of that product was.\nBut more importantly it doesn't change the\nsubstance of the deal between the two parties. What the\nutilities come to the table with is cash, and they\nprovide the feed. It is fungible as a matter of its\nphysical properties. It is a gas. And when the feed is\nput into the gaseous diffusion chamber, which is the\nlarge installation that the enricher uses to concentrate\nthe two different molecular isotopes, it takes a month\nfor the gas to work its way through this plant. The\nenricher cannot feasibly segregate different lots of\nfeed, just like you can't with a grain elevator.\nThe analogy would be, with respect to a\ngrain elevator, you would have to run in one farmer's\nbag of feed, run it all the way through the elevator and\nthrough the mill, and wait until the product comes out\nat the end, and then run another farmer's bag of feed\nthrough. That's economically impractical and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, old mills used to do\nthat. The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill,\nand it would be ground right there while he was waiting.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But -- but there is nothing\nabout the economic transaction that requires that it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's absolutely true.\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- that happen, and more\nimportantly, the enrichers don't end up at the end of\nthe day with any feed. They are also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your brief constantly\nassumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the\nentire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately\nbecomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same\nfeedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately\ndelivered. And that is simply not true. There is a\nchange -- there is a change of ownership. The feedstock\nthat somebody else put into the mix is now transferred\nto the -- to the electric utility.\nMS. HALLIGAN: It may be the same molecules;\nit may not be. There is no way to know or to tell. And\nthere is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's exactly right. You\ndon't know. So, you had cannot say that there has been\nno transfer of ownership.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Respectfully, Your Honor, I\ndisagree. If you look at the contracts, and the\nsubstance squares with the contracts because, at the end\nof this transaction, what the enricher walks away with\nis cash and what the utilities walk away with are the\nsame number of uranium molecules that they came to that\nplant with.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, we've got the same\nmolecules. I mean, when you are talking about whether\nthere has been a transfer of ownership or a transfer of\ntitle, you are talking about molecules; you are not\ntalking about whether you ended up the same in, you\nknow, in monetary terms. You are talk about whether you\nhave the same thing that you delivered to the person\noverseas. And you don't, or at least you can't say that\nyou do.\nMS. HALLIGAN: You can't say for sure\nbecause the gas molecules can't be segregated that way.\nI think that you need to look at two things:\nI think that you need to look at what each of the\nparties to the transaction come to the table with and\nwhat they walk away with. And with respect to the\nutilities, they come to the table with uranium. It's a\nvery expensive commodity. The contracts are clear that\nthey hold title to it through the process until such\ntime as they take possession of the concentrated\nuranium. It is clear from the contracts that there is\nan intent to maintain a continuous stream of ownership.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That makes no sense, what\nyou just said. That contract makes no sense. They hold\ntitle to it until they get the uranium rods, right?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, they hold title to it\nuntil -- just to provide a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Most of it is back\noverseas. It's still mixed with the other fungible U\n235.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, the contracts\nprovide several things. First of all, they provide that\nthe utilities will deliver their feed within a certain\nnumber of days prior to the date on which they will have\nthe concentrated uranium product provided to them. It's\n60 to 90 days, depending on the contract.\nSo, pursuant to the contract, they deliver\nthe uranium feed. The utilities run it through their\nsystem. And at the end of that diffusion process, they\ntake the concentrated isotopes out and they provide that\nto the utility. The enrichers don't receive any amount\nof feed that they can then take on to the open market.\nBy distinction, if you look at a used car\nsale, for example, which is an analogy the government\nuses. If I want to trade my car in, I come to the\ndealer and I bring with me two pieces of consideration.\nI bring the used car, which is payment in time and I\nbring cash. I walk away with my wallet a little bit\nlighter and a new car, and the used car dealer has cash,\nbut also has an item that he can then go out onto the\nmarket and sell.\nThat does not occur here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's only -- that's only\ntrue because apparently they use up all the feed that\nthey get. If, in fact, they found a way to manufacture\nto enrich more efficiently so that some feed was left\nover, I presume you would not be here arguing that they\ncould not sell that feed on the open market even after\nthey had delivered the enriched uranium to the buyer?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The price terms of the\ncontract provide only for the utilities to pay for the\namount of energy that is expended.\nI would distinguish this from another kind\nof contract per uranium feed, which we don't contest is\ncovered by the antidumping laws. There is a very small\npercentage of concentrated uranium, of low enriched\nuranium that is sold pursuant to what the parties call\nan enriched uranium product contract, an EDP contract.\nThat sort of a contract is one in which the enricher\ngoes out into the market procures feed and performs a\nprocessing service. The utility comes to the enricher,\npays them cash and walks away with the product.\nBy comparison, in these contracts, the\nutilities are providing something that is very valuable.\nThe feed company --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but why are they\nproviding something that is very valuable that, in fact,\ncould not be obtained by the enricher on the open market\nif those were the contract terms? The enricher buys it\nin the -- in the -- I forget the acronym in the case\nthat you just described -- and we don't know -- we have\nno reason to believe the enricher couldn't go out on the\nmarket and buy it if, in fact, the utility didn't supply\nthe feed.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Those are very different\nkinds of contracts, though, Your Honor.\nThe contract in which the enricher simply\nprovides some amount of enriched uranium for a price and\nprocures the feed, which is a sliver of the total\ncontracts -- it's 5 percent even for USEC -- is one in\nwhich the enricher is bearing the cost of the feed and\nthe risk of those price fluctuations.\nThe reasons that the contracts are\npredominantly, almost exclusively structured as services\ncontracts by distinction is that the utilities choose to\nmanage the process of procuring fuel themselves.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. They would rather\nmanage the risk of price fluctuation than, in effect,\npay the premium that the processor would have to charge\nin order to hedge against price fluctuation --\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's why they are doing\nthat.\nMS. HALLIGAN: And so, they go out into the\nmarket and procure the feed pursuant to whatever\narrangements they have with their feed suppliers. By\ncomparison, all they are coming to the enricher for is\nthe service of concentrating that positional isotope\ninto the assay --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is a way of looking at\nit. But another way of looking at it is because they\nchoose to, in effect, take the risk of price fluctuation\nas preferable to paying a higher ultimate price, they\nare simply, for that reason, choosing to pay both in\ncash and in a -- a valuable commodity, i.e., unenriched\nuranium. You can look at it either way.\nMS. HALLIGAN: They are. But they are\nchoosing to pay two completely different entities in two\nunrelated and two unlinked transactions. So, it\ndoesn't -- we are not disagreeing that there is a\ntransaction for feed that the uranium -- that the\nutilities engage in to procure their feed. There has to\nbe. But that is not part of the distinct services\ncontracts for processing only, which is all that the\nDepartment of Commerce is looking to shoehorn into this\nstatute here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Halligan, try this\nhypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the\ndoubt. Let's assume a department store buys raw wool\nfrom some sheep herder, sends it overseas. And it's\nworth $1,000, this raw wool. It is processed, spun and\nknitted into sweaters, and then shipped back to the\ndepartment store. The sweaters, all made from the same\nwool, not even fungible, so that's why this is even\nbetter than your example -- the sweaters when they come\nback, are worth not $1,000, but $20,000.\nDo you think it would be unreasonable for\nthe Commerce Department to treat that as a sale of\nsweaters by the European knitting wool or -- or home\nknitters who did the sweaters?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It would be perfectly\nappropriate for the Department of Commerce to do what it\nhas done in the past, which is to treat the sale of the\nsweater by the U.S. companies for $20,000 as the\ncognizable sale.\nThe only thing that makes this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again?\nMS. HALLIGAN: In your hypothetical --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about the --\nI'm talking about the sale from the European mills to\nthe American department store.\nMS. HALLIGAN: That would be a processing\ntransaction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A processing transaction.\nIt has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what\ndid I say -- $20,000? And that's just processing?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Let me give you an example of\nwhat the Department of Commerce has looked at. They --\nthey looked at the processing of pasta. And the --\nthere the manufacturer came to a company -- this is a\nplace called Certain Pasta from Italy -- it's referenced\nin the brief -- the company came to the processor with\nwheat and presumably whatever other products went into\nthe pasta, some milk or eggs. The pasta was processed\nand made into pasta from the wheat and given back to the\nU.S. company.\nThe Department of Commerce concluded that\nthe appropriate sales target was not the making of the\npasta, the processing of the pasta, but the downstream\nsale of the pasta in the United States.\nAnd that is what the statute requires.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They said there was no\nsale.\nMS. HALLIGAN: They said that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When the pasta was\nimported, there was no sale into the United States.\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, they said that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's what we are\ntalking about here.\nMS. HALLIGAN: We don't disagree, Your\nHonor, that there is a product that comes into the\nUnited States, it's low enriched uranium. But the\nstatute doesn't target the importation of products. And\nin that way it is distinct from the companion statute,\nthe countervailing duty statute. What this statute, the\nantidumping statute, covers is the sale of merchandise\ninto the United States.\nThat means that you have to have merchandise\nas distinct from services, but by comparison to\ncountervailing duty statute covers both, which is part\nof how we know that Congress means that distinction\ntolls. And you have to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Get back to your pasta\ncase. Was the holding of that case that there was no\nsale into the United States?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The question before Commerce\nwas which transaction is the appropriate transaction for\nus to treat as -- as the one that establishes the price\nall over the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different issue.\nWe are not talking here about which transaction\nestablishes the price. We are talking simply about\nwhether there was a sale into the United States.\nMS. HALLIGAN: It turns on the same issue,\nYour Honor, and here's why. In all of these processing\ncases that the Department of Commerce has looked at,\nthey have explained that the reason why the cognizable\nsale is the sale of the finished product in the United\nStates, the pasta, the sweater, or whatever it may be,\nis because the statute gets at price discrimination.\nAnd it instructs the Department to look at the price at\nwhich the product is sold in the United States.\nThe price for the weaving of the sweaters,\neven if it does add the sort of value that you are\ntalking about, is not the price at which the product is\nsold, nor does it reflect all of the components of the\ntransaction, because there is some components that the\nwool request. So to determine whether there is price\ndiscrimination, you have to look apples to apples at\nwhich the product is sold in the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait. Suppose these\nknitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their\nsweaters for a much higher price in Europe. Instead of\n$20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are\nselling it for $40,000. And they nonetheless sell the\nwool back into the United States for only $20,000.\nYou are telling me that that transaction\ndoesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping\nlaw?\nMS. HALLIGAN: To the extent that it may --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That you have to look at\nthe price at which the department store then sells to\nindividuals?\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's right. Because that's\nwhat the statute is intended to capture. The statute\nwas enacted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the department store is\nnot dumping. It's -- it's the knitting mills that are\ndumping.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But the question, Your Honor,\nis -- is the price at which the product is sold in the\nUnited States. Section 1677(a) defines \"export price\"\nand \"constructed export price\" as the price at which the\nsubject merchandise is first sold in the United States.\nAnd that is what you have to look at.\nIt may certainly be true that you may be\nable to sell a product at less than its fair value to\nthe extent that you are obtaining processing services at\na price lower than what you could obtain them in a\nforeign country. But the -- the bottom line is you have\nto look at what the statute explicitly instructs, at the\nprice at which the subject merchandise is sold in the\nUnited States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And accepting that,\nyou -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with\na sale, with a sale into the United States, right?\nMS. HALLIGAN: A sale and I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought this is --\nthis is what you say fails in this case. That is the\nlink of the chain that doesn't exist. You say there is\nno sale in the United States.\nMS. HALLIGAN: There is an importation of\nLEU into the United States by the utilities. The\nutilities consume that fuel in their reactors. They do\nnot sell it onward as the company would sell a sweater\nor would sell a pasta or would sell Rya rugs. That is\nsomething that makes this case somewhat different and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is pretty important.\nTell me -- this is a hard area, obviously. But the --\nimagine -- think of all the toller cases that they've\nhad.\nNow -- now, is this right: That in every\none of those cases there were two companies, A and B;\nand in every one of those cases A sells a finished\nproduct into the United States. And also A sends the\nproduct to B to have some major thing done on it. In\nevery one of those cases the Commerce Department could\nsay: We can take A as a Respondent; i.e. we think A\nmight violate the law, because maybe it's an Italian\ncompany, or we think B might violate the law. Is that\ntrue of all those cases?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It is true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if it's\ntrue of all those cases, then I think what the opposite\nposition is, what Mr. Farr said, I think -- I think, you\nknow, I will -- he will say: Look at page 40 and 41 of\ntheir brief. When I look at those pages, I am going to\nsee a lot of cases. And I bet, when I look them up,\nthose Commerce cases are all going to use the word\n\"substantial transformation.\" And he will say: You\nsee, that's what they did here.\nThen he's going to add -- I don't mean to\nput words in his mouth if the words are wrong, but --\nbut he's going to add: Look at those tolling cases.\nThose are all cases where Commerce had a choice of which\nto consider the sale. It could have considered the sale\nfrom the processor A to -- to B to A, the sale if it\nwanted to; or it could have considered the sale into the\nUnited States if it had wanted to, to be the sale for\npurposes of calculating the price.\nAnd so in choosing between those two, either\nof which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale,\nthe final sale, because that's how they could calculate\nthe price.\nBut in your case there is no such person A,\nbecause the utilities are not people who could be\nrespondents. I mean they are not in the same position.\nThere is no sale onwards that they could choose. So we\nwill go to the other guy, the party -- the person who\ndoes the processing. Are you following what I am\nsaying?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes. And then it starts an\ninvidious --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what is the answer to\nthat?\nMS. HALLIGAN: And here is why that's not\nsufficient. It's the problem of the tail wagging the\ndog, right? What the United States is saying is that\nbecause in this single circumstance we do not have a\ndownstream sale of pasta, or a sweater, or whatever the\nitem might be, and we can't go after that transaction,\nthat, therefore, we are asking this Court to sign off on\nessentially rewriting the statute.\nThe statute refers to a sale of merchandise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But, remember, they\nare saying in the tolling cases, in my words: Hey, we\ncould have gone after the processor if we wanted --\nMS. HALLIGAN: But that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if there had been a\nsubstantial transformation, because the key to this\nconcept of \"sale\" is the word \"substantial\"\ntransformation.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Two responses, Your Honor:\nFirst of all, the statute doesn't allow\nthat, and I would recommend to the court the remand\nresponse that Commerce provided in the Taiwan\nsemiconductor case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In which --\nMS. HALLIGAN: The Taiwan semiconductor case\nwhich is cited in the brief. It explains why the\ndefinition of \"export price\" and \"constructed export\nprice\" means you can't go after a processing\ntransaction.\nSecondly, in order to find for the\ngovernment here and reverse the Federal circuit, you\nwould effectively have to agree with the government's\nposition that processing services where they are part of\nthe manufacturing operation somehow are within the terms\nof the statute. And so that would mean that the\ngovernment can say in this case that because there's no\ndownstream sale that it can capture, it will choose to\ngo after the processing transaction. But there is no\nway to gauge down the road whether it will make the same\nchoice. And here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does -- what does the\ngovernment do with respect to these other transactions\nwhere, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed\nuranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting\nthe rods?\nMS. HALLIGAN: In those cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no down -- you\nknow, there is no domestic sale there, either. Is it\nconceivable that there, therefore, can be no dumping in\nsuch a case?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No. Those cases -- we -- we\ndo not disagree -- are a sale of merchandise because the\nutility is paying for the entire commodity.\nWhat -- that is a substantial transformation\npoint, Justice Breyer. I would like to -- to return to\nthat.\nThere are many processing transactions which\ninvolve some kind of substantial transformation where\nyou have a product like wheat and you turn it into\nsomething else like pasta, or wool and you turn it into\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that in all\nof those cases there is no transfer of ownership of the\nbasic product? And here -- and I am not sure you have\nreally addressed it --it is a fungible product, and you\nare assuming you can't tell whether -- when it is in\nprocess or whether it is one party's or the other's.\nBut if you could tell and you had some way\nof identifying just which one here, but they wouldn't\ncare because they are all equally valuable, and if it\ndeveloped that it was actually a third party's product\nthat was being processed, then there would be a transfer\nof ownership, and there clearly would be a sale. Isn't\nthat true?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think not, Your Honor,\ncertainly not for the same reasons that you would have\nthat in -- in a grain elevator. If the enricher goes\nout and purchases the feed and holds title to that feed\nwhile it is enriching it, then, yes, there would be a\ntransfer of ownership.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you have the same\ncontract you've got here, but you are able to identify\nthat, in fact, there is a difference in the -- in the\ncommodity that -- that -- at least not a different raw\nmaterial that was sent to France and returned. It is\njust a substitute. It seems to me that -- in that\ncontext, within the meaning of your argument, that there\nwould have been the transfer of title to that -- that\ncommodity.\nMS. HALLIGAN: First of all, you can't tell\n-- and I don't think there is any -- any dispute as to\nthat fact. But, secondly, if you look at the common law\nof --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, isn't it true, if\nyou can't tell, the odds are that there is some product\nthe title to which has been transferred?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, I -- I think you\ncertainly can't tell what molecules come out the other\nend. I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can't we assume -- let's\nassume that there is.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that there are --\nare two sources for the uranium, A and B, and it goes to\nthe enricher. A gives it; B gives it. A ends up with\nB's uranium. Justice Stevens is saying at some point\nthere is a transfer of title.\nMS. HALLIGAN: And that's -- that's the\noperative premise that I am disagreeing with, with all\ndue respect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. We are asking you to\naccept that hypothetical, so we can --\nMS. HALLIGAN: I mean the legal -- the legal\nconsequences is -- is what I am --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying the utility\ndoesn't have title to what was formerly B's uranium?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The utility holds title to a\ndiscreet amount of feed uranium. It's in -- I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The enrichment is done.\nIt's back in the United States. The utility says: This\nis my uranium. I have title. Do you dispute that?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, not at all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does he get the title\nfrom -- to the uranium that was formerly B's uranium?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At what point did that\ntitle transfer?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It -- maybe the useful\nanalogy is money -- is money in the bank, Your Honor.\nIf I take $100 and I bring it to the bank, ten 10's, and\nI take away five 20's, I may not have the same dollar\nbills that I brought to the bank, but I don't think\nanyone would argue that, somehow, the bank takes title\nto my money. I retain ownership of that, and there is\nnothing in the contract which suggests that there is any\nchange of ownership that is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you\ndon't retain ownership of that. And if you go to the\nbank and say: Show me my money, they are not going to\nsay: Well, here's your money. They -- they have title\nto it. They own it, and you have a claim against the\nbank to what you gave them.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But the bank could not hold\ntitle to that as against me if I came and tried to take\nthe money out of my safe deposit box, nor could the\nfarmers at the -- at the grain elevator be told that\nthey -- they don't have title to the grain.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any point in time\nfrom the time that the -- the processors get ahold of\nthe uranium until the time it leaves their control that\nif they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility\ncould get ahold of the product?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay.\nMS. HALLIGAN: And let me clarify this\nbecause it's an important issue. These are very\nexpensive, offshore transactions that the utilities\nengage in in order to purchase a feed. It is a very\nvaluable commodity. So what is critical to the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if they go\nbankrupt because -- I mean let's say they don't have all\nthe uranium. They have got five people who shipped them\nuranium, and they have only got enough for four. Each\nof the five can't say: I'm entitled to get mine back.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But -- but the system doesn't\noperate that way, Your Honor. The contracts provide\nthat the utilities have to deliver feed. And it's a\nvery different sort of business that the utilities are\nengaged in, to go out into the market and make bets\nbased on the price fluctuations for uranium and procure\nthat uranium.\nThe enrichers are not in that business, and\nso there would be no economic reason or any reason\nprovided for in the contracts for them to proceed that\nway.\nI would like to touch briefly, if I can, on\nthe purpose of the statute, because the government\nrelies very strongly on this notion that somehow the\nprocessors' sales have to cognizable in order to further\nthe antidumping statute.\nThis law is not a boundless license to\nprotect domestic industry from any competition. There\nare other statutes that are are written much more\nbroadly in the trade laws; for example, the\ncountervailing duties law, the safeguards law which\nallows the Department of Commerce to impose quotas or\ntariffs on the import -- not the sale but the import of\nany goods, statutes regarding the protection of\nintellect0ual property rights, all of which are cited in\nthe -- in the briefs.\nSo the notion that somehow to protect the\nintegrity of the statute you need to rewrite it to allow\nthem to address processing sales exclusively is really\nnot -- not well-founded.\nFinally, with respect to the loophole\nquestion that the government has relied on, I think it's\nimportant to focus on what is specifically at issue\nhere. The government initially argued that it was\ncritical to address this case and these particular\ntransactions because of concerns about agreements with\nthe Russians.\nThat has been addressed as to U.S. concedes\nin its -- legislation that has been implemented by\nCongress. The government has consistently in court and\nin its decisions -- not just in the Contract Disputes\nAct that you referenced Justice Ginsburg, but in other\ncases regarding the UCC which relates to the sale of\ngoods, the government has said: These very kinds of\ncontracts for the processing of uranium are contracts\nfor services. They are not covered by statutes that\nreach the sale of goods or the disposal of property.\nThere is nothing that has changed with\nregard to the statute or with regard to these kinds of\ntransactions; and, accordingly, we would ask you to\naffirm the Federal Circuit. If there are no other\nquestions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nHalligan. Mr. Stewart, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nIN NO. 07-1059\nMR. STEWART: Thank you.\nOne of the things Ms. Halligan said, and I\nthink it's really a central theme of their brief, is\nthat utilities come to the enricher for services and not\nfor goods. And to understand what it is that utilities\nacquire, I think it may be helpful to ask: Under what\ncircumstances would the utility have a valid breach-of-\ncontract right?\nAnd it is very clear that the enricher's\nobligation under the contract is to deliver a specified\nquantity and assay of enriched uranium at a specified\ntime and place. And if the enricher complies with that\nobligation, it doesn't matter that the enricher decided\nto -- what they call in the industry -- \"overfeed\"; that\nis, use more feed staff stock and fewer SWU's to produce\nthe final product.\nAnd the utility in that circumstance\ncouldn't file a breach-of-contract claim by saying: I\npaid for more SWU's than I actually received. Because\nwhat the utility had contracted for was a given product.\nThe second thing -- and I think the\ncorollary to that is -- it's potentially misleading to\nsay that every contract is either one for merchandise or\none for services, especially when you are contracting to\nacquire ownership of a commodity that doesn't exist at\nthe time the contract is formed. The only way you are\ngoing to get to your ultimate objective is for somebody\nto create it. And that can generally be described as a\nservice, but it still results in the sale of goods.\nWith respect to the used-car analogy, I\nunderstood Ms. Halligan to acknowledge that -- that that\nwould be a sale even though the consideration paid by\nthe customer is partly in cash and partly in kind. And\nif the customer and the car dealership characterize\ntheir contract as one for car-refurbishment services and\nsaid that the new car the customer receives shall be\ndeemed to be the used car that it traded in in\nrefurbished form, nobody would contend that that deeming\nquality should be controlling.\nNow here the -- the falseness of the\nproposition that it's the same feedstock is less\napparent, but it's equally the case that the utility\ndoesn't receive back its original feedstock.\nAnd finally the perspective of tolling\nregulation in cases, Commerce has essentially said three\nthings:\nFirst, we were dealing with a separate\nquestion; that is, who is the producer, which sale is\nrelevant, and not whether the goods are covered at all.\nSecond, they said in those situations the\ntollee was exercising much more control over the\nultimate process than is the case here where the\nutilities don't manufacture anything. They simply pay\nfor one of the inputs.\nAnd, finally, Commerce said that if at some\nlevel of abstraction there is a tension or contradiction\nbetween what we said previously and what we decide\ntoday, then what we decide today controls. And Commerce\nis entitled to make that determination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\n"
