KOESTER, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KOESTER: Thank you.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nIn the course of a drunk driving\ninvestigation, quickly securing blood alcohol evidence\nwith as little delay as possible is incredibly\nimportant --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How come it took so long\nfor this State to figure out that it needed to do this\nwithout a warrant?\nMR. KOESTER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The officer testified\nthat he's been making drunk driving arrests for years --\nMR. KOESTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and I think in only\none circumstance did he need to do it without a warrant.\nSo what made the need here eminent in the sense of\nimpractical to get the warrant?\nMR. KOESTER: Well, Your Honor, back in\n2003, there was a -- an appellate court case from\nMissouri that dealt with the importance of the words --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I understand why he\ndecided to do it, to forego getting a warrant. Isn't\nhis testimony dispositive of this case? He had time to\nget it.\nMR. KOESTER: Your Honor, that -- that\nignores the fact that had he sought a warrant -- there's\nno question that he would have been able to secure a\nwarrant. The issue was, it was going to take a\nconsiderable amount of time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it took a\nconsiderable amount of time for all the years he did it.\nMR. KOESTER: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and he didn't\ntestify to it -- it causing a loss of any particular\ncase.\nMR. KOESTER: But in this particular case,\nit was going to take 90 minutes to two hours to secure\nthe warrant. And during that period of time, the most\nprobative evidence was going to be dissipating, was\ngoing to be lost.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he said -- he said in\nthe ten or so cases he had had in the past, I had -- I\nencountered no difficulty getting a warrant in prior\ncases. There was nothing that distinguished this case\non the facts from other cases on the facts.\nMR. KOESTER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg, he never had a problem securing a warrant, but\nthere was a delay; and that's -- that's the difference.\nWe're -- we're looking at a delay, and quickly securing\nblood alcohol evidence is important because the -- the\nevidence is being lost at a significant rate with every\nminute that passes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What constitutional\nright exists for a State to get the best evidence?\nMR. KOESTER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I\nthink that that is something that we should always\nstrive for, to be able to get the best possible evidence\nin the case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. You, the\nState, want to strive for that. But what in the Fourth\nAmendment contemplates that that's a right the State\nmust have, that is has to get the very best evidence it\ncan?\nMR. KOESTER: The -- the touchstone of any\nFourth Amendment analysis is the reasonableness of the\nsearch. And it's reasonable -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how can it be\nreasonable to forego the Fourth Amendment in a procedure\nas intrusive as a needle going into someone's body? I\nsay this because breathalyzers in my mind have a much\ndifferent intrusion level. They don't intrude into your\nbody. And I think almost all jurisdictions use\nbreathalyzers instead of blood tests. A small fraction\nthat actually use blood tests.\nThe ruling by us today is going to change\nthat and is going to -- if in your favor is going to\nchange that and is going to -- if in your favor, is\ngoing to change that and put sort of a print, the\nCourt's print, on: Use the most intrusive way you can\nto prove your case.\nMR. KOESTER: And, Justice Sotomayor, I\nwould -- I would disagree with that. If the Court rules\nin our favor, I think the end result will be more people\nwill agree to take the breathalyzer test. In this case,\nthe arresting officer gave the defendant an option to\ntake the breathalyzer test and when he clearly told him\nhe was not going to take it, that's when he decided to\ntake him to the hospital in order to draw the blood.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you force him to\ntake the breathalyzer test, instead of forcing him to\nhave a needle shoved in his -- in his arm?\nMR. KOESTER: For practical --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the\ndifference between the reliability or the acceptability\nby juries of a breathalyzer test, as opposed to a blood\ndraw?\nMR. KOESTER: Justice Scalia, both tests are\nvery reliable. We rely on the breathalyzer test on a\ndaily basis, but for practical reasons it's very\ndifficult to force a drunk driver to take a breath test.\nThe breathalyzer instruments, they measure deep lung\nalveolar air.\nAnd you have to take a very deep breath.\nAnd one police officer told me it's sort of like you can\nput a balloon in front of somebody's mouth, but you\ncan't make him blow it up. It's very difficult for\npractical reasons to force someone to -- to blow into\nthe breathalyzer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we are talking about\nreasonableness, do you think it's relevant for us to\nlook to the rules and practices of other States?\nMR. KOESTER: Justice Kennedy, as the\nRespondent points out, there are 25 States that would be\nopposed to -- to the warrantless blood draw at issue in\nthis case. And as I point out in the reply brief, 15 of\nthose States have joined amicus Delaware urging this\nCourt to reverse the decision of the Missouri Supreme\nCourt, but I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the fact that those\nStates do have a warrant requirement and from what we\ncan best tell make it work very well, including some\nexpedited procedures where you can get warrants within\nminutes -- it takes usually the policemen, say, 20\nminutes to get just to the hospital or the police\nstation anyway.\nMR. KOESTER: And, Justice --\nAnd if -- if we see that other States, a\nsignificant amount of other States, number one, require\nthe warrant, number two, many of those have expedited\nprocedures, does that bear on our determination of\nreasonableness?\nMR. KOESTER: I don't believe it does,\nJustice Kennedy. I think, as -- as Virginia v. Moore\nplainly teaches, individual State laws do not affect\nwhether or not this activity was reasonable under the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have -- have\nalways -- correct me if I'm wrong. I think that we have\nalways thought of Fourth Amendment reasonableness\nstandards as being a national standard. Suppose 40\nStates -- you know, we can play the game. Suppose 40\nStates had rules that you have warrants and many of them\nhad expedited procedures. That's still irrelevant? We\ndon't look at that at all?\nMR. KOESTER: Your Honor, I think this\nCourt's decision in Sampson v. California is\ninstructive. In that particular case, the Court\napproved suspicion-less searches of parolees, and I\nthink a vast majority of States disapproved of that\nparticular law enforcement practice. But that does not\nbear on the issue of whether or not that violates the\nFourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course we don't know why\nthey disapproved. And I guess your point is they may\nwell not have permitted it because they were under what\nyou would call the mistaken belief that it was\nunconstitutional.\nMR. KOESTER: I suppose that is -- that is a\npossibility, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any showing that\nconviction rate in those States is lower than in the\nStates where the practice is -- is to take the test\nwithout the warrant?\nMR. KOESTER: Your Honor, I think amici\nNational District Attorneys Association cited a study.\nI know the Respondent also cited a study that shows it\ndoesn't have any bearing. But I think it's -- it's\npretty clear that if you have concrete evidence of a\ndrunk driver's blood alcohol content, concrete evidence,\nthat gives you a far greater case, a far greater chance\nof securing a conviction at trial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the new rule is we\nhave to strengthen -- the Fourth Amendment is going to\nbe suspended whenever the prosecution can't get the best\nevidence to make its case out?\nMR. KOESTER: No, Justice Sotomayor. I\nthink as long as a police officer has probable cause,\nwhat -- what we're saying is it's objectively --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Probable cause is\nnot enough. If you have probable cause, then you can\nget a warrant. But it was and I think still is the main\nrule that if you can get a warrant, you must do that.\nProbable cause is surely not enough. Then we'd never\nneed a warrant when there's probable cause.\nMR. KOESTER: You are absolutely right,\nJustice Ginsburg, probable cause is not enough. But\nprobable cause coupled with the indisputable fact that\nalcohol is eliminated from the human body with every\nminute that passes after a drunk driver is pulled\nover --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Koester, suppose that,\ninstead of waiting two hours, there were procedures in\nplace in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where\nit was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances\nwithin 15 or 20 minutes. Would you still be saying that\nthere is a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant\nrequirement?\nMR. KOESTER: I think if a particular\njurisdiction had perfected the warrant process to the\npoint where they could routinely obtain search warrants\nin 15 minutes, I think we would have a different\noutcome. I think that would affect the analysis of the\ncase. But with all due respect to the hypothetical, I\nthink it is a time-consuming process to obtain search\nwarrants.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why can't you do that?\nI mean, the only virtue I see in saying you have to go\nget a warrant is the officer picks up the phone, there\nis usually somebody on duty, a magistrate somewhere, he\nphones him up and says, I have a drunk driver here; he's\nwobbling, he can't cross the center line; and he won't\ntake a breathalyzer; I want to give him a test.\nNow, you have a second judgment and the\nofficer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more\ncareful. And that's a protection, not necessarily for\nthis person, but a protection for others who maybe\nweren't wobbling.\nAll right. So I think that's the question\nyou're being asked. Why -- what's the problem with\ndoing that? Which adds a little bit of security that\nthis warrant really is -- this search is really\nnecessary.\nMR. KOESTER: Justice Breyer, I think in\npractical application it is going to be more of a\ntime-consuming process, though, to obtain the search --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't it take --\nlet's see, how long did it take me to say that? It took\nme about 30 seconds. So -- so even if you are a lot\nmore careful, why would it take more than, say,\n3 minutes?\nMR. KOESTER: To obtain a search warrant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what you do is you\nhave a system, and you phone up and you do just what I\nsaid. And this man or woman who is there is not a\npoliceman. That's the virtue of it is this man or woman is\ntrained to listen to policemen and others say things and\ntry to pin him down a little bit and make an independent\njudgment. So -- so why would it take more than 5\nminutes?\nMR. KOESTER: Well, Justice Breyer, that's\nwhy I drew the analogy between the telephonic search\nwarrants that were approved back in the 1970s. It\nsounds like that would be an instantaneous procedure,\nbut some of the lower courts that have actually examined\nthe process, they came to the conclusion that it's still\na time consuming process --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Koester, in most\njurisdictions, unless I'm mistaken, the cop on the beat\ncannot apply for and get a search warrant. He has to go\nthrough a prosecuting attorney or someone in the\nprosecutor's office first. So it's not just getting\nhold of a judge. It's getting hold of the prosecutor\nfirst and then getting hold of the judge if the\nprosecutor approves it, right?\nMR. KOESTER: That is -- is absolutely\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the case in\nMissouri?\nMR. KOESTER: That is the case in Missouri.\nThe prosecution attorney --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In some cases I\nsuppose the judges actually want to read the affidavit\nand give it some thought. It's not going to be 3\nminutes.\nMR. KOESTER: That's exactly right,\nMr. Chief Justice. I think if we were to the point\nwhere we were approving search warrants in 3 minutes, it\nwould essentially be a rubber stamp --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do have -- we do\nhave, I think, an indication that there are\njurisdictions that do it inside of a half-hour.\nMR. KOESTER: That -- that may be true,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do you define\nreasonableness --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You suggest that 15 or 20\nwould be a different case. I am wondering where you\nwould draw the bright line.\nMR. KOESTER: That's a difficult question,\nto draw a bright line for exactly when we would draw the\nline where -- where the exigency would disappear.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So would the importance\nof the search warrant suggest, as a constitutional\nright, suggest that we should judge reasonableness by\nthe people who are the least efficient or by the people\nwho are the most reasonably efficient?\nMR. KOESTER: Well, Justice Sotomayor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning people, police\njurisdictions.\nMR. KOESTER: In -- of course, local law\nenforcement practices are going to vary from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Absolutely, but should\nthey -- should we permit them to vary in terms of\ninefficiency or should we be encouraging them to vary\nwithin a reasonable range?\nMR. KOESTER: Well, I think prosecutors are\nalways going to strive to -- obtain search warrants as\nefficiently as possible. But whether or not this was a\nreasonable search does not depend upon local police\npractices.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Members of the Court\nhave intruded on your rebuttal time, including me, so we\nwill give you a little extra.\nMR. KOESTER: Thank you.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHere the police are facing a certain destruction of\ncritical blood alcohol evidence. Every minute counts,\nand it's reasonable for the officers to proceed without\na warrant.\nI would like to pick up where some of the\nCourt's questions led off: This idea that we might live\nin a world where warrants could be gotten so quickly\nthat -- there is not true exigency. First of all, that\nis not state of the world now. There is substantial\nvariation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and we are\njust not in a place where the time to get the warrant\neverywhere is 15 minutes or less.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- I mean, once we say\nthat you don't need a warrant -- you know, even if\nthings improve, the game's up, right? No?\nMS. SAHARSKY: No, I don't think that that's\ntrue at all. The police do not have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean somebody can come\nup 10 years from now and say, although you approved it\n10 years ago without a warrant, things have changed, so\nnow you need a warrant?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that if the world\nchanged so that every police officer had an iPad and\nthat judges were always on duty and that the warrants\ncould be gotten that quickly, you would consider that\nand you would also consider the other sources of delay,\nwhich are the time to get to the hospital, etcetera,\netcetera. But yes, I would -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if that's the case,\nthen why shouldn't that determination be made case by\ncase?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Case by case, whether in\nfact it would have taken that long to get a warrant?\nAnd if it -- if it would have taken too long, then it's\nokay without a warrant. If it wouldn't have taken that\nlong, it's bad.\nMS. SAHARSKY: The question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Totality of the\ncircumstances test, right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right, but the totality of\nthe circumstances are with respect to the destruction of\nevidence and what the police are witnessing. They know\nthere is certain destruction of evidence and what they\nare weighing that against is uncertainty about whether\nthere's time to get a warrant. They have no idea what\nthis person's blood alcohol content is. They have no\nidea how fast it's decreasing. They might --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Saharsky, what about\nsaying at least they should try, since a number of\njurisdictions can do this within a half hour, say,\ninitiate the process while you are going to the\nhospital; when a half-hour is up you proceed; but at\nleast there has been an effort to get a warrant.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think there -- I think\nthere are legal problems with that and practical\nproblems with that. The legal problems is that the\nCourt has never suggested that the police are both\nsimultaneously in require-a-warrant land and not in\nrequire-a-warrant land.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we have -- I don't\nwant to because you have multiple answers -- but on that\npoint, we do talk about exigent circumstances. If -- if\nwe proceed as Justice Ginsburg's suggestion indicates,\nthen the fact that you can't get a warrant within\n45 minutes is the exigent circumstance.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right. I mean, in all of the\ndestruction of evidence cases the Court has said,\nThere's destruction of evidence; we're not going to make\nyou wait until half of it is destroyed or three-fourths\nof it is destroyed or something like. And that's the\nrule really that Respondents want. Everyone --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Ginsburg said\n30 minutes.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right. And what I'm saying\nis as a practical matter, I think it would be very\ndifficult to -- to suspect that nationwide folks could\nget warrants in those circumstances. You typically have\none police officer on the scene who is making the\ntraffic stop, asking the person questions, taking him\nthrough the field sobriety test. That would have to be\nthe officer who would do the affidavit in support of the\nsearch warrant because he's the one who's witnessing --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Jurisdictions have an\nincentive to get a warrant, I would think. Even if\nthey -- even if we were to say that they don't need one,\nthey certainly have a strong incentive to get warrants\nbecause it insulates the search to a much greater degree\nfrom later challenge -- at a suppression hearing. So\nwhy shouldn't it depend on the practicalities in a\nparticular jurisdiction?\nNot every jurisdiction has prosecutors and\njudges who are staying up at -- you know, 3:00 o'clock\nin the morning on Sunday morning waiting for the phone\nto ring or for -- to receive some sort of an electronic\nmessage that there has been a stop and somebody wants\na -- wants a search warrant. Maybe -- you know, big\njurisdictions can do that, but small ones can't.\nSo why -- but if you are in a big\njurisdiction that -- or one that feels that they can\nafford that, then why should -- you know, why should the\nFourth Amendment permit the search to take place without\nthe warrant when it could have been obtained practically --\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean, a couple of\nresponses. First of all, this Court makes nationwide\nrules and the question is whether it's reasonable to do\nwhat Missouri did here even if other jurisdictions would\nchoose to or could do it differently.\nBut second -- you know, this idea with respect\nto -- that it should matter based on the time to get a\nwarrant is something the Court has never done in its\nFourth Amendment exigency cases. And it may be the case\nthat a court looking backwards could say, well, we think\nyou had enough time to get a warrant.\nBut the police officer where he stands with\nthe person, he knows a few things. He knows one thing\nfor sure: That evidence is going to be lost, and it's\ncritical evidence. It's not just to get above .08, but\nyou have these laws that are enhanced with --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought -- I thought\nthat we often said that you look at whether or not you\ncan get a warrant before you can break in so that the\ndrugs aren't flushed down the toilet and so forth. We\nmake that judgment all the time.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that showing is not\nmade, you must get a warrant.\nMS. SAHARSKY: But the Court -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So I think it's quite\nincorrect to say that we -- we don't look at the time\nfactor.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it matters as a\ngeneral --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We look at it all the\ntime.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it matters as a\ngeneral matter whether warrants take time to get and\nwhether evidence is lost. But the Court has never gone\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. It has never\nsecond-guessed the police in the way that the Court is\nsuggesting today.\nIn Kentucky v. King, for example, an\nexigency case, the Court said the police could have\nproceeded a couple of different ways here; we are not\ngoing to make them use the least restrictive way; we are\njust going to ask whether what they did was reasonable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree that there is a\nuniform standard. But -- and I don't know if you ever\ndid finish the answer to Justice Ginsburg, but she --\nshe had suggested that we have a uniform rule of exigent\ncircumstances. That -- her suggestion complies with\nyour objection.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, if I am understanding\nit correctly, I think our point is this, which is that\nthe police officers have to act reasonably in the\nsituation. And in a situation they know for sure the\nevidence is going to be lost, they know that every\nminute is critical. For example, Respondent here's\nblood --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there are so many\nsituations in which we require a warrant, nevertheless.\nWhen there is drug dealing in a house, every time people\nenter that house, it's almost a certainty that they're\ngoing to use the drugs and that evidence is going to\ndisappear. You rely on hope -- on knowing that there's\nlikely to be telltale signs left over.\nAnd that's the same thing you do in an\nalcohol situation. You rely on the testimony of the\npolice officer, you rely on the implied consent\npresumption. It's not as if this is destruction of all\nevidence, and -- and not like a fleeing situation where\nsomeone gets away, you have nothing left. This is --\nthis is vastly different.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I mean, with respect, we\ndisagree. This evidence is critical, and the number\nmatters. I mean, it is the case that blood alcohol\nevidence is the most important evidence. This Court has\nrecognized this in several cases -- Schmerber,\nSkinner -- and since then the law has only changed to\nmake it more important. In 2005 you had --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned Schmerber.\nWhy did the Court go through all of the -- why -- it\ncould have made it a much shorter opinion by simply\nsaying, yes, blood alcohol dissipates. But it didn't.\nIt -- it pointed out that in that particular case there\nwas a delay to investigate the accident, the person had\nto be taken to the hospital for care, so how much time\nelapsed? I think it was two hours, wasn't it?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The Court -- made a mention\nof two hours, but that was not a critical portion of its\nanalysis. We don't think that that mattered to\nSchmerber because the Court said, first, there was clear\nprobable cause in that situation. Second of all --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was all the -- why\nwas it in the opinion?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, it's one line in the\nopinion. If you look at it, the Court says, we are told\nthe percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to\ndiminish shortly after drinking stops, the body\nfunctions to eliminate it from the system. Particularly\nin a case like this, time had to be taken to bring the\naccused to a hospital and to investigate the scene --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. They didn't need to\nsay any of that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, they said particularly\nit means there's an extra thing. But it doesn't mean\nthat the first thing wasn't enough. And what we say is\nif there was some uncertainty in Schmerber, the Court's\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't mean that it\nwas enough, either, right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, that gives me the\nsecond part of my answer, which is the Court's cases\nsince Schmerber have relied on the destruction of this\nevidence being enough for exigency.\nAnd I would just point the Court to look at\nSkinner, at South Dakota v. Neville, at Winston v. Lee,\nand even in a footnote in Kentucky v. King. This Court\nhas not said anything about the person having to go to\nthe hospital and whether there was an investigation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel for Missouri tells\nus, Ms. Saharsky, that the breathalyzer is just as good\nand that in fact he expects that the consequence of our\nruling in his favor in this case will be that drunken\ndrivers will agree to the breathalyzer test.\nBut I don't know why it isn't adequate to\nproduce that result simply to put the drunken driver in\na -- in a paddy wagon and on the way to the hospital\nsay -- you know, we're going to be in the hospital in\n20 minutes; we're applying for a warrant; when we get\nthere, we're going to -- we're going to -- you know,\nstick a needle in your arm, unless, of course, you agree\nto take the breathalyzer test. Why isn't that enough\nto -- to force them into the breathalyzer test, so that\nthey will blow up the balloon.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, because in that\nsituation, I think they're willing to take their chances\nthat the evidence is going to dissipate below the .08\nstandard or below these higher enhanced penalties, .15,\nand then be able to challenge it, as opposed to if they\ngave the evidence that they potentially wouldn't be able\nto challenge it.\nBut I think the point that comes --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Or maybe they're drunk.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, but, but -- I mean,\nJustice Scalia raises a point, which is you always have\nsome delay. Unless you are talking about sticking a\nneedle in somebody roadside, you have to take them to\nthe hospital. So there's going to be some amount of\ntime which you're going to lose, and why can't you use\nthat amount of time, if you can, to try to get a\nwarrant?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think there are two\nanswers. One, you typically as a practical matter have\none officer on the scene who's proceeding with this and\nhe's the one that would have to prepare the affidavit,\ntypically the one to consult with the prosecutor. He's\nthe one who's going to drive to the hospital.\nPresumably, we don't want him texting during driving, et\ncetera.\nThe second answer is a legal answer, which\nis that the Court has been very hesitant to second-guess\nthe police in these circumstances and to say when the\npolice are in a fluid situation they have to, say, try\nto get a second officer on the scene and maybe do the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I think you should be\nfair. He doesn't have to prepare a written affidavit in\na number of these States. It's a telephonic warrant.\nYou have to give us that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, even in some of the\ntelephonic -- telephonic warrant procedures, you still\nhave to have a written document. You just write it out\nand then you read it to the judge and then actually a\nrecord needs to be made of it. The case United States\nv. Reid in the Fourth Circuit actually considered this\nand said -- you know, it sounds like it won't take that\nlong, but it turns out these procedures actually take a\nwhile.\nAnd it's not just the time to get a warrant.\nIt's the initial time that had been taken at the stop,\nthe investigation, the field sobriety test. Then,\nthere's the time to get to the hospital. And -- you\nknow, sometimes these people, these folks, get to the\nhospital and they're not given first priority, so\nthere's sometimes some waiting at the hospital. So a\nsignificant --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is it okay -- is it\nokay to let police officers take the blood?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, we think that's a\ndifferent question and one that the Court reserved in\nSchmerber. The Court said there was medical personnel\nin a medical setting taking the blood in that case.\nThat's the exact same thing that's happening here.\nBut it said if we had a different case, we'd\nask whether the -- the situation invited an unjustified\nelement of personal risk of infection and pain. So we\nthink the Court should get a case that has a record on\nthis and then it could make a determination as to\nwhether there is that risk.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, I bet that if we\nrule in your favor, we will.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm not sure that that's\ntrue. The reason that a few States have considered\nhaving police officers get trained in this way is\nbasically out of necessity. It is just in rural\njurisdictions it's too far to get to the nearest\nhospital.\nBut it's fair to say that police officers do\nnot want to be in this business of taking blood. It\ndiverts them from their other activities. It's -- you\nknow, it's an extensive training process. So I -- I'm\nnot sure that that's true, but it's not something the\nCourt has to decide --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you want to be in\nthose rural places and be stopped without an independent\nmagistrate approving a field officer taking blood from\nyou?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, what I'm saying is that\nthere are only a few States that are doing it now, and I\nthink it is -- it should be -- the Court should wait\nuntil it actually has a record to make that\ndetermination. But -- you know, there has been training\nalong those lines.\nThat's something, for example, that NHTSA at\nthe Department of Transportation has helped these States\ninvestigate whether it's a real option because the\npolice officers are very far away from -- you know, the\nnearest hospital and that it's -- it's all based on this\nconcern about destruction of evidence.\nBut just to get back to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think going back to\nJustice Scalia's question, if a person does take a\nbreathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless\nblood test?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. As a general matter,\nyou would not need to obtain a blood test -- you know,\npractically because the evidence is not the same, but --\nyou know, substantially as good. The blood test is a\nlittle better in that you have a sample that sticks\naround as opposed to one that is gone. You also get two\nsamples, so the defense can test it, and it is better\nevidence with respect to whether it's susceptible to\nchallenge.\nYou also might have someone who consents to\na breath test, but because, as you pointed out, they're\nso drunk they can't give a good sample, like they say\nthey'll provide a sample, but they really just can't.\nAnd then there's another case that is not\nthe fact here, but something we would want the Court to\nbe careful about, which is driving under the influence\nof drugs. Those do not show up on a breath test, but\nthe police officers might have very good reason to\nbelieve that the person is under the influence, such\nthat they might take a breath test and get a zero\nreading, but still want to take a warrantless blood\ntest.\nSo all the Court needs to do to resolve this\ncase is say where this person refused a breathalyzer --\nactually, the exact same facts of Schmerber -- it was --\nit was reasonable for the police to say, we know this\nevidence is going away, we know it's going to be lost,\nmaybe we can get a warrant quickly, maybe we can't, we\ndon't know what his blood alcohol is, we don't know when\nit's going to dip below .15, .08, let's just go ahead\nand proceed.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All this talk about -- you\nknow, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose\nthe exact same thing could be said in other\nalcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage\ndrinking. You wouldn't be making the same arguments\nthere, would you? Or would you?\nMS. SAHARSKY: No. I mean, the -- the\nquestion you'd ask will be the same, which would be a\nreasonableness balancing test, but I think the\ngovernment interest on the side of that balance would be\nvery different from the ones at issue here. You know,\nthe Court here has said that drunk driving is a serious\npublic safety problem. We're talking about one person\nbeing killed every 51 minutes, despite everything we've\ndone in the last 3 decades.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So it's not just exigency\nthat you're -- you're saying that there should be a\nweighing of the costs and benefits here.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. That's what the Court\ndid in Schmerber. It looked at the intrusiveness of the\nblood test in this context and then it looked at the\ngovernment's need for the evidence. And the need for\nthe evidence in the cases you're positing we suspect the\nCourt would not think as strong as the evidence here.\nBut just to get back to some of the\nquestions the Court has had about the time to get\nwarrants, I mean, the evidence that the Court has before\nit is that it would take at least an hour and a half to\ntwo hours to get a warrant here. That's in the Joint\nAppendix, page 54. Even though the person said -- one\nofficer said he could get in touch with the prosecutor\nand judge, he did not quantify how long it would take.\nThere's also an exhibit that the defense --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidentally, it wasn't\nclear to me: Is that 1 hour from the time of the --\npardon me -- two hours from the time of the stop or two\nhours from the time he put him in the back of the patrol\ncar? Do we know?\nMS. SAHARSKY: It's not entirely clear, but\nI think it's two hours total. There was also on page 70\nof the Joint Appendix an exhibit that the defense put in\nthat make it look like one and a half hours to two hours\ntotal. I also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nthought.\nMS. SAHARSKY: There's one other piece of\ndata, which is a NHTSA study that's referred to in the\nbriefs, about where the court -- where folks in four\nStates where warrants were required tried to get them\nquickly as possible.\nThey put the judges on staff, they tried to\ndo it electronically as much as possible, and still\nthere it was one and half to two hours. That's on page\n37 of that study.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN R. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SHAPIRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether the State\nmay stick a needle in the arm of everyone arrested on\nsuspicion of drunk driving without a warrant and without\nconsent. Missouri's answer to that question is yes,\neven in routine DWI cases like this and regardless of\nhow quickly and easily a warrant could be obtained.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the question was\nif -- if in fact the person won't agree to a\nbreathalyzer.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The question is -- it's not\nclear to me. Number one, Your Honor, there's nothing in\nthe record to suggest that the driver is always first\noffered the opportunity, the choice of choosing a\nbreathalyzer as opposed to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was your client was offered\nthe breathalyzer twice?\nMR. SHAPIRO: This client was offered the\nbreathalyzer, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How many times?\nMR. SHAPIRO: And declined it twice, that's\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nBut under Missouri's proposed rule, there is\nno role at all for a neutral and detached magistrate.\nThe decision whether an individual can be required to\nsubmit to a nonconsensual blood draw, often while\nhandcuffed and physically restrained as my client was -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, aside from all --\nthe thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind,\nis, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a\nneutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to\nact as a second judgment on that; it would make it less\nlikely that people who are really innocent, in fact,\nhave this happen to them and so forth.\nBut they're arguing that that's a -- that's\na considerable burden in many, but not all States. And\nat some point -- and the addition in respect to the\nsecond judgment, namely the magistrates that you get, is\nnot worth really what you're going to lose, which are\ngoing to be people who are drunk driving around on roads\nand -- and possibly killing people. We all know how\nthat side can be built up, too.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So at some point, I would\nwish you would spend some time addressing that, that\npractical argument.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I'd be happy to answer that\nquestion right now, Your Honor. I think there are two\nresponses. One is Missouri specific and case specific\nand one is more generic because I think it's important\nto remember they are not asking simply to reverse the\nsuppression motion in this case on the grounds that the\nfacts of this case made it reasonable to do a\nwarrantless blood draw.\nWhat Missouri and the United States are\nurging is a categorical exemption to the warrant\nrequirement in all DWI cases nationwide. So we have to\nthink not only about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a lot of sound and\nfury signifying nothing? I mean, what -- what advantage\ndo you think your client would -- would really get from\nthe warrant requirement other than the delay that that\nwould entail allowing his blood alcohol to reduce\nitself?\nAre the -- for some warrants, let's say a\nwarrant to go into a building where the police contend\nthere may be drugs, the policeman will -- will you know,\nthe magistrate will say, What evidence do you have that\nthere's drugs? Well -- you know, two weeks ago we had\nthis informer, yesterday we saw this and so -- you know,\nall sorts of different factors.\nIn these DUI cases it's always going to be\nthe same thing. The policeman is going to say, well --\nyou know, his breath smelled of alcohol; we gave him the\nwalk a straight line and turn around test, he flunked\nit; he couldn't touch his nose with his index finger.\nWhat is the impartial magistrate possibly going to do\nexcept to say, hey -- you know, that's probable cause.\nAre any of these warrants ever turned down?\nAre they ever turned down in your experience?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, I do not know the\nanswer to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I bet you they're not.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But I think it's also true,\nYour Honor, that warrants in general are rarely turned\ndown, that the overwhelming percentage of warrant\nrequests in all criminal cases are granted -- are\ngranted by magistrates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But in many of them there\nis a lot of judgment that has to be brought to bear: Is\nthis a reliable informant, how long ago did he tell you,\nand so forth. Whereas, in all of these cases it's going\nto be the same thing: His breath smelled of alcohol, he\ncouldn't walk a straight line, and whatnot. And -- and\nthat's the probable cause. And I don't see how the\nindependent magistrate is going to do you a whole lot of\ngood, except for the fact that it will delay the\nprocess.\nMR. SHAPIRO: This Court's entire Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence, Your Honor, rests on the\nproposition that the privacy safeguards of the Fourth\nAmendment benefit by having a neutral and detached\nmagistrate review the evidence before the State does\nsomething as intrusive as putting a needle in somebody's\narm.\nAnd I could imagine a situation --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the State has a\nform; we have some forms in the Joint Appendix. What if it\nhas a form for the officer to fill out? He checks\ncertain boxes, and then you send this electronically to\na magistrate, and if the right boxes are checked, the\nmagistrate will grant the warrant.\nIs that -- do you think that is consistent\nwith the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it's something very\nclose to what Missouri already has, Your Honor. In Cape\nGirardeau County the prosecutor has prepared\nstandardized forms which the police officer then fills\nout, presents to the prosecutor, the prosecutors sends\non to the magistrate and the magistrate decides whether\nto grant the warrant. But I think that cuts in exactly\nthe opposite direction, which it shows that the process\nof obtaining a warrant is not very elaborate and it need\nit not be very timely.\nAnd I can imagine, in answer to\nJustice Scalia's questions, I can imagine circumstances\nin which an officer might apply for a warrant in a\nsituation where they have not asked the driver, for\nexample, to go through the field sobriety test; said as\nthey -- as we stopped the driver on the road, he was\ngoing 10 miles over the speed limit, I questioned him,\nhis speech was slurred, his eyes seemed bloodshot, I\nwant to do a blood test.\nAnd the magistrate in that circumstance\nmight say, did you at least perform the field sobriety\ntest? Did you at least offer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about that field\nsobriety test? Suppose the person who is apprehended\nand is suspected of being drunk says, I'm not going to\nwalk a straight line. I'm going to just sit here. You\ncan't make me do anything without a warrant.\nDo you need -- if the defendant doesn't\nconsent, do you need a warrant to -- to have the\nstandard sobriety test?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Do you mean do you need a\nwarrant to have the field sobriety test?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Is that the question, Justice\nGinsburg? I don't think you need a warrant to require\nsomebody to put his finger to his nose or to walk a\nstraight line or to stand on one foot. I would not say\nthat that is a search within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment that triggers the warrant requirement.\nBut there is no doubt that putting a needle\nin somebody's arm triggers a warrant requirement. And I\nthink there are really two --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a\nbreathalyzer, do you need a warrant for that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think you probably do need a\nwarrant for a breathalyzer, Your Honor. But --\nMissouri's position is you not only don't need a warrant\nfor a breathalyzer, you don't need a warrant for a blood\ntest. And we don't -- this is not a breathalyzer case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what\nMissouri's position is, and I know it's not a\nbreathalyzer test. But if the logic of your position\nleads to the requirement of a warrant for breathalyzer,\nthat would be pertinent in analyzing your position.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think -- I think, Your\nHonor, it -- I would say that requiring somebody to\nproduce, to breathe into a machine for -- in order to\ngather evidence for the State's prosecution is a\nstate -- is a search that should probably trigger the\nwarrant requirement, but it is certainly a less -- it is\ncertainly less intrusive, Your Honor, it is certainly\nless intrusive than -- than the blood test --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It bears considerably on\nthe reasonableness, doesn't it? I don't know why you\nwant to bite off more than you can chew.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I certainly don't want\nto bite -- I want to bite off --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a different case and\nwhat is reasonable for sticking a needle in your arm is\nnot necessarily reasonable for asking you to blow up a\nballoon.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, I certainly want\nto bite off as little as I have to chew in this case,\nbut -- but there are two salient facts because I think\nit is important to focus on what is before the Court in\nthis case. And what is before the Court in this case is\na warrantless blood draw, and the two salient facts in\nmy mind are, one, as I said, case specific.\nYou have a State trooper here who has been\ndoing this for 17 and a half years. He testifies at the\nsuppression hearing that he has only been required to\nseek a warrant fewer than ten times. Why is that? That\nis because the overwhelming number of drivers, in fact,\ngive their consent. And in the ten cases over those\n17 years where he had to seek a warrant, he testifies\nthat he never had any difficulty obtaining a warrant,\nand there is certainly no indication that those warrants\nin any way interfered with the State's ability to\nprosecute those cases.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Shapiro, could you\ntell me, and what I am deeply troubled about in your\nargument, is you incant the totality of the\ncircumstances test. But what circumstances is the Court\nactually looking at to determine whether forgoing the\nwarrant was necessary or not under that circumstance?\nWe know one. We know where a fatality has occurred or a\nserious accident because we -- presumably you have to\nsecure the scene and you have to take care of injured\npeople or have cars towed, whatever else it is.\nBut I'm not sure what other circumstances\nunder your theory would really justify a magistrate -- a\ncourt below saying, you -- you know, it's okay, you didn't\nget a warrant here. It can't be merely because it takes\ntoo long to get the warrant because that shows\ninefficiency. It was part of my question earlier.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, so that's exactly\ncorrect, Your Honor. I think the Court got it right in\nSchmerber. I think the question is: Are there special\nfacts that are extrinsic to the warrant process itself\nand that are beyond the control of the police that\nsignificantly impede the ability of the police even to\ninitiate the warrant process.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you are in a\nrural -- in a rural jurisdiction and it takes a long\ntime to rouse a prosecutor and a magistrate at 3:00 in\nthe morning to get the warrant. You would say, that's\ntoo bad, everybody has -- the whole country has to\noperate like New York City, you have to have somebody on\nduty all the time.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, Cape\nGirardeau County is a rural county in southeastern\nMissouri --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I'm asking you a\nhypothetical question. I -- I bet there are places like\nthat. I have encountered magistrate -- Federal\nmagistrate judges who were unreceptive to receiving\nwarrant applications in the middle of the night, and\nthat is known to -- to exist. Suppose you have a\njurisdiction like that? Does that count as a\ncircumstance that would justify a warrantless taking of\nblood?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I would say no, Your Honor. I\ndon't think the State ought to be able to take advantage\nof its own failure to modernize an expedited --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the magistrate is\nunavailable because he or she is ill?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Then I think that's a\ndifferent situation, Your Honor. I think that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that\nthat's an exigent circumstance which would allow a\nwarrantless blood sample?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think it might well if the\nmagistrate were unavailable and there were no\nalternative magistrate.\nBut the second salient fact, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shapiro, that's a separate question,\nisn't it? I mean, one prong of your argument is you\nneed individualized circumstances, you can't have a per\nse rule. And now this other set of questions is about what\nyou get to count in the totality of the circumstances\ntest; is that right?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is correct,\nJustice Kagan.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So one could disagree with\nyou and one could think, as Justice Alito and\nJustice Kennedy suggested -- you know, you do take into\naccount that it's the middle of the night in a rural\ncounty and it's going to take two hours, but still\nthink, well, that's the analysis you have to go through.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is correct,\nJustice Kagan. And the second fact though I just wanted to\ncome back to, and this came up briefly during my\nopponent's argument, is we know that there are half the\nStates in the country by our count, 26 States in the\ncountry that by statute have prohibited warrantless\nblood draws in routine DWI cases. They are listed on\npage 31 of the red brief in Footnote 9.\nGiven that fact, in the face of that\nreality, I don't think Missouri can plausibly claim that\na categorical rule that would then apply nationwide if\nthis Court were to announce it in the context of this\ncase, that warrants are never required in routine DWI\ncases, could satisfy the standard that this Court has\nestablished, namely that the exception to the warrant\nrequirement that is being proposed serves law\nenforcement needs so compelling that a warrantless\nsearch is objectively reasonable in every case.\nThere is no evidence that I am aware of, in\nresponse to Justice Kennedy's question, and there is\ncertainly no evidence in the record in this case or in\nthe briefs in this case that those 25 States that\nprohibit warrantless blood draws in the circumstances\nthat my client confronted here have a lower conviction\nrate, are less concerned about drunk drivers --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A lot of States have\nvarying degrees to which they want to enforce strict\nrules against drunk driving. And a State -- that's\nexactly the kind of thing that worries me on your side.\nThe -- you have a bunch of States that don't -- you\nknow, it's not easy to get hold of a magistrate in\n15 minutes or so forth. And so what to do about that?\nIf you say, well, you don't have to because\nyou haven't got it provided, you give them every\nincentive not to make the magistrate available. That's\ncutting in your favor. On the other hand, it's pretty\ntough to say that all these States have to have the best\npossible magistrate available 24 hours a day so somebody\ncan call in ten instances a year because the guy won't\ntake the blood test -- won't take the breathalyzer.\nAnd that's where I am in a dilemma. And so\nI'm looking for an answer to that. And you don't have\nan absolute rule or I don't see an absolute rule.\nShould you say, look, here's what you have to do, it's\nbetter to have a second opinion there, which is the\nmagistrate's?\nAnd so on the way to the hospital, it's just\nthat's where we started, you have to phone and try to\nget one, and if you don't have one by the time you're at\nthe hospital, tell them again: It's your last chance,\ngive us the breathalyzer or else. And he says no,\nthen you take the blood test. Is that the solution, or\ndo you have a better solution? What's the solution to\nthe problem if you are willing to reject, which you\naren't, but hypothetically you might be, that there's\nthe absolute rule.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I would say several\nthings. First of all, Your Honor, I really do have no\nreason to believe that there's any jurisdiction in the\ncountry at this point that is not deeply concerned about\ndrunk driving, or recognizes that drunk driving is a\nserious problem. That is certainly not our position.\nSecondly, the reason I think that there is\nno evidence that in the States that prohibit warrantless\nblood draws in routine DWI cases like this have lower\nconviction rates is, number one, in most cases, they can\nobtain consent; number two, in cases where they can't\nobtain consent, they have been able to obtain warrants\nin a timely -- in a timely fashion; and number three,\neven in the absence of warrants, all the facts that lead\nto probable cause often create a very compelling case\nfor conviction in the absence of the blood alcohol --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is what you\ndon't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think\nof a second-best solution it might always be better than\nwhat I think of as a second-best solution.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I have enormous confidence in\nyou, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I want to know if you\nwant to say anything that would suggest -- we have a\nnumber of them floating around and -- and I just wonder\nif you want to express any view on a second-best\nsolution.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, well -- well, our -- our\nposition, and I'm not sure whether you're classifying\nthis as our first position or -- or something else --\nour position is that within the context of Schmerber, if\nthere are special facts external to the warrant\nrequirement, then you have to apply a totality of the\ncircumstances test, and you ought to apply a\nreasonableness standard.\nIn the context of the delays that are\nintrinsic to the warrant requirement, absent and if any\nevidence that those intrinsic delays have interfered\nwith the ability of 25 States in the country to enforce\ntheir drunk driving laws, this Court ought not to adopt\na categorical exception to the -- to the warrant\nrequirement.\nAnd the risk of doing it, as you pointed\nout, Justice Breyer, is then you create this odd\ndisincentive, which is the States that have the most --\nhave the slowest and most cumbersome warrant procedures\nare the States that get a free pass and are able to\noverride the Fourth Amendment. That seems to me -\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's not true because\nthere's a great advantage to the prosecution in having a\nsearch with a warrant as opposed to a warrantless search\nin terms of suppression; isn't that correct?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is some advantage\nto having -- certainly, a search that is conducted\npursuant to a warrant is much less subject to\nsuppression than a search that is subject not pursuant\nto a warrant. But -- but there is generally speaking in\nthese cases a probable cause that is derived from the\nofficer's observations on the scene and the defendant's\nperformance in the field sobriety test, that -- that --\nyou know, can support the warrant -- support -- support\nthe search.\nBut I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question?\nHow much blood has to be taken in order to test for\nblood alcohol? What if medical technology advances\nto -- I gather it's a -- it's a substantial amount. But\nwhat if it advances to the point that you don't need any\nmore blood than you need now to test blood sugar, and\nyou just have a little machine that makes a tiny prick\nin somebody's finger and you've got enough blood to do a\nblood alcohol test. Does it change then?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I don't -- excuse me -- I\ndon't think the Fourth Amendment rule turns on the\namount of blood that you take out of somebody's body. I\nthink the Fourth -- an important, maybe not the\nimportant dividing line, an important dividing line for\nFourth Amendment purposes is puncturing the skin, and\nthe Court has recognized this in other circumstances.\nAnd I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So does that mean --\nthe last footnote in the Solicitor General's brief talks\nabout some other methods, including a urine sample. Not\nas accurate as blood, but it can help achieve the same\nresult. One of the things that I think affects the view\nin this case is it's a pretty scary image of somebody\nrestrained, and -- you know, a representative of the\nState approaching them with a needle. But I take it you\nwould say you need a search warrant for a urine sample,\ntoo?\nMR. SHAPIRO: This Court has said that, Your\nHonor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- in a variety of\ncircumstances with drug testing cases, where they\nweren't even law enforcement cases, they were special\nneeds cases. The Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout this device that you just sort of hold in front of\nthat you don't have to blow up the balloon, you just hold\nit in front of the individual and it measures to some\nextent blood alcohol content, or at least whether the\nindividual's been drinking? Surely you don't need a\nsearch warrant for that.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think that -- I think that's\nprobably -- I think that's probably correct, Your Honor.\nYou presumably do not need a search warrant, a search\nwarrant for that. And this Court held, first in\nSchmerber and then reaffirmed in South\nDakota v. Neville, that there is no Fifth Amendment\nissue in requiring the defendant to produce the evidence\nthat can then be used against you. So we know we're not\ntalking about a self-incrimination problem; we're\ntalking about a search and seizure problem.\nAnd if the government were able to obtain\nthe evidence in a way that did not rise to the level of\na search, then the warrant requirement wouldn't apply.\nBut we are not there. We're not there.\nAnd -- and the -- the warrant process\nthat -- that Missouri has described is -- is not as\ncomplicated. There are many places now that, number\none, permit not only telephonic warrants but electronic\nwarrants, where officers are equipped in their patrol\ncars with laptop computers. They can fill out these\npre-prepared forms in a matter of minutes -- e-mail them\nto the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're in an odd --\nodd position to be making -- it's an understandable\nposition -- your argument is these warrants are just\neasy as -- as pie. You just send in this thing, the\njudge does it in an instant, it doesn't take very long\nat all. It seems to me that that diminishes the\nprotection of the Fourth Amendment to a far -- far\ngreater extent.\nThe idea is that the prosecuting attorney is\nsupposed to spend some time looking at this before\nsubmitting it to the judge and the judge is supposed to\nspend some time examining it. But the idea that you're\ngoing to do these things in a half hour seems\nunreasonable to me.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But I don't think it's\nunreasonable, Your Honor, and it's because we all\nrecognize that the evidence in these cases is relatively\nroutinized, and the procedures are relatively\nstandardized. But that does not mean there is not a\nvalue to the warrant process, and to the second look by\na mutual and detached magistrate. And the value of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Shapiro, could you\ngo back to what in this conversation we sort of have\nlost focus of, which is the question presented, and\nwhich is the essence, I think, of your adversary's\narguments. I'm not sure you've really put forth -- the\nessence of their argument is that you can forego the\nwarrant requirement when you know for a fact that\nevidence is going to dissipate over time.\nBasically, they're saying this process\nundermines our right to get a warrant because the\nevidence is dissipating. We certainly have cases that\ntalk about destruction of evidence being a reason to\nforego the warrant. What makes this case different from\nthose?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I'd be happy to answer that\nquestion, Justice Sotomayor, if I could just complete my\nanswer to the Chief Justice for one second.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sure.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And my answer would be that\neven if there are boxes on a standardized form, there is\nvalue to making sure that the prosecutor and the police\nhave checked off all the right boxes before they engage\nin a process as intrusive as putting a needle in\nsomebody's arm.\nNow, in answer to Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion, I think -- I think there are multiple answers,\nYour Honor. First, this Court has on two\noccasions considered and rejected the notion that the\nmere fact that alcohol dissipates over time is itself\nsufficient to proceed without a warrant.\nAs Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in\nSchmerber, the Court's discussion of what the Court\nitself called special facts would have been unnecessary\nif all the Court needed to say was that this natural\ndissipation of alcohol in the blood automatically would\nlead to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an\nodd case because Justice Ginsburg and you are exactly right,\nthat they spend a lot of time talking about special\nfacts, and particularly so, but then you read the\nopinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't\nfind the special facts.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think the special facts,\nYour Honor, were the accident and the injuries at the\nscene, which delayed the police for two hours before\nthey could even get to the hospital and initiate the\nprocess of applying for a warrant, at a time when there\nwere no cell phones, there were no faxes, there were no\ninternets, and all warrant applications had to be\npresented in person. That's a very, very different\nsituation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if they had sent more\npolice officers to the scene, they could have done\neverything faster.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they had sent more police\nofficers to the scene of the accident, if they -- then\nthey could have done it faster.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Perhaps.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what's the difference\nbetween that practical limitation and the limitation\nthat exists in a world -- in a rural jurisdiction?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think that practical\nlimitation, whether or not there were other officers on\nthe scene, right, or that could have been sent to the\nscene, we're not asking for a rule in which this Court\nwould direct police officers how they -- they ought to\ndeploy their resources. If there are multiple police\nofficers on the scene, I don't think it's unreasonable\nto say one can attend to the accident and the other one\ncan search -- can search for a warrant, and that becomes\npart of the totality of the circumstances. But\nSchmerber is not the only case, Your Honor.\nIn -- in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the Court\nexpressly said that the mere dissipation of alcohol in\nthe blood was not sufficient to justify a warrantless\nentry into a defendant's home in order to arrest the\ndefendant on DWI charges. It's explicit holding, it's\nnot simply an inference that one has to draw from\nSchmerber.\nThe second thing I would say in response to\nyour question, Justice Sotomayor, is -- is -- is\nbiology. And that it is true that alcohol dissipates\nover time through natural body processes. But that's\nonly after the blood alcohol level has reached its peak,\nand that is generally about half an hour after somebody\nhas had his last drink. So there is a period of time in\nwhich the blood -- the body is continuing to absorb\nalcohol and then -- and the blood alcohol level is\ncontinuing to rise. Only at peak does it then start to\ndissipate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry,\nwhat's the relevance of that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The relevance of that is that\nit is not true that in every -- it won't be true in\nevery case, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State is losing\nevidence with each passing moment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it depends upon\nwhen the last -- if a person left the restaurant right\nafter they had a nightcap and then left, but if they\njust had drinks before, I mean, the problem seems to be\nthere in either case.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know when\nthe person's last drink was.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you may or may not know,\ndepending upon what the -- the person is willing to tell\nyou. All I'm saying is that in every case, in every\ncase, it's not the situation that from the moment you\nstop the driver, his blood alcohol level is going down.\nThere will be some cases where it is going up.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am probably just -- but a\npoliceman has probable cause to believe that somebody\ninside the house has drugs. He hears the toilet\nflushing and he thinks they're flushing the drugs down\nthe drain.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He doesn't have to get a\nwarrant as long as he reasonably believes that the\nevidence is disappearing. All right. Now, the\ndifference between your case here and that is\nspecifically what? Suppose we were just to refer to\nthose cases --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and say it's the same\nthing.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Because the process is a very\ndifferent process. In the typical drug case, which is\nwhat this Court has considered when it has examined the\nquestion of whether the destruction of evidence\nqualifies as an exigent circumstance, that question has\nalmost always arisen in what I'll call a typical drug\ncase, Richards v. Wisconsin, Kentucky v. King. And in\nthose situations, what the Court is worried about is\nthat the suspect inside the house is going to flush the\ndrugs down the toilet.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying is if\nit's now or never --\nMR. SHAPIRO: It is now or --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- where the other is a\nslow process.\nMR. SHAPIRO: It is now or never and not\nonly is it now or never, that -- but in most of those\ncases, probably not all, but in most of the cases, the\nState's case is going to disappear down the drain along\nwith the drugs and the ability to destroy the drugs lies\nentirely within the control of the defendant. The\ndefendant gets to decide whether he's going to put the\ndrugs down the toilet or not and when he does, the\ndestruction is immediate and total.\nIn this situation, the process is gradual.\nIt takes hours. It can take hours, depending upon how\nmuch alcohol is -- is in the system and it is outside\nthe control of the suspect. There is nothing that the\nsuspect can do to expedite the process of the\ndestruction of evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we -- we know the\ndefense attorneys love it when there's a delay because\nthen the retrograde analysis has more and more\ncontingencies that make it unreliable.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That may be -- that may --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you'd much rather\nexamine the State's expert if the sample was taken three\nhours than if it were -- after the arrest than one. I\nmean, that's a given.\nMR. SHAPIRO: There is -- there is -- there\nis no doubt, Justice Kennedy, first of all, the\nretrograde extrapolation evidence, which is now being\nconsidered in various courts around the country is\ncontroversial. It's subject to cross-examination. You\nknow -- the -- we haven't resolved whether -- whether\nthe state of that -- the state of that -- the state of\nthat evidence yet. But having said that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought you\nwould also distinguish the drug flush cases on -- on the\nground that violation of the integrity of your home is\nsomewhat less than violation of the integrity of your\nbody.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think that that is\ncertainly -- that is certainly true -- that is certainly\ntrue as well, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that goes into the\nreasonableness determination.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right. And there -- and there\nis no doubt, I will not deny, the State's case will be\neasier if it does not have to obtain a warrant, but this\ncase -- Court has recognized that many times in the\npast. Criminal investigations are always easier if the\nState does not have to comply with the warrant process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, before your\ntime runs out, the case of the fingernail --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Mm-hmm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- scrapings has been\nraised as saying well, that's -- somebody is going to\nscrape your fingernails, that's as intrusive as a blood\ntest.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I would say three\nthings, Your Honor. I don't think it is as intrusive,\nalthough even in Cupp v. Murphy, which is that case, the\nCourt described it as a serious, but brief intrusion on\nthe cherished value of personal security. The Court\nrecognized that even the -- the fingernail scrape was --\nwas a serious Fourth Amendment issue.\nSecondly, that evidence, unlike the blood\nalcohol evidence, was under the control of the defendant\nand in that case, on the facts of that case, much like\nmany of the Court's other exigent circumstances cases,\nthere was evidence that suggests that the defendant was\nactively engaged in the process of degrading the\nevidence at the time that the police stepped in and said\nwe're going to preserve what is left rather than allow\nyou to be the agent of your own destruction.\nAnd as the Court said in Kentucky v. King,\nit is a very different situation when you have the\ndefendant himself destroying evidence. Under those\ncircumstances, it may be reasonable for the Court to say\nyou can't simultaneously destroy evidence and then\nprotest that the destruction of the evidence -- evidence\nhas created the exigency that requires the State to act\nwithout a warrant. But there is no agency in this case\non behalf of the defendant. The defendant has no\ncapacity.\nAnd I come back to what I said before. It\nis true, I think this question came -- came up earlier,\nwhen Mr. Koester was being -- was being questioned.\nFourth Amendment standards are not determined by State\nlaw. The Court has said that in Virginia v. Moore. We\nall understand that. But in the determination of what\nis reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, this Court has\noften looked to State practices in response to\nJustice Kennedy's question.\nIn Tennessee v. Garner, you have the Court\nsay half the States have abrogated the Common Law Rule\nthat would have allowed the police to shoot any felon --\nfleeing felon. In Richards v. Wisconsin, you have half\nthe States that did not support an exception to the No Knock\nRule. Here we have half the States in the country that\nwould not have permitted what went on in this case.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Koester, you have -- we'll give you\nthree minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN N. KOESTER, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KOESTER: Thank you. Everyone agrees\nthat the closer a chemical test is taken to the time of\ndriving, the more reliable the evidence of intoxication\nis, the more reliable the evidence of impairment is.\nSo under the Respondent's approach, it would\nbe mandated that we're going to allow the most reliable\nevidence to dissipate and degrade over a period of time\nin favor of admittedly less reliable evidence taken at a\nlater time. And I -- that's -- that's simply\ninconsistent with -- with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence\nand -- and other destruction of evidence cases. I\nbelieve the Respondent's proposed rule here is\ncompletely impractical and unworkable.\nIf there are no further questions, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
