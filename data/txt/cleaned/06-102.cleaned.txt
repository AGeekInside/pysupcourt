CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first today in case 06-102, Sinochem International
versus Malaysia International Shipping Corporation.
Mr. Castanias.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
This Court in Ruhrgas against Marathon
encapsulated the relevant line of this Court's
precedents in the rule that we suggest controls in this
case. What it said, it is hardly novel for a Federal
court to choose among threshold grounds denying audience
to a case on the merits. Now this Court's cases
extending through Steel Company and Ruhrgas and
afterward, hold true to this statement. Threshold
non-merits issues may be decided by a Federal court
before it determines its jurisdiction, in that term
meant as subject matter and personal jurisdiction.
This Court in this case should hold the
forum non conveniens is another one of those threshold
non-merits grounds for denying audience to a case that
can be considered first before jurisdiction.
Adopting that rule in this case will do
three things. First, it will result in a rule that is
most faithful to the Court's precedents in the area.
Second, it will respect the rule of Steel
Company and forbid ultra vires judgments on the merits.
There is no chance that a dismissal in forum non
conveniens will exercise more power than is granted to
the Federal courts by Article III or by Congress in
statutes.
And finally, it will give the Federal courts
the appropriate flexibility in appropriate cases to
serve important interests such as economy,
constitutional avoidance, and particularly relevant in
this case, international comity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on the second point.
I wanted -- does the rule of the Federal
district court in forum non conveniens where it
dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it
have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case? I
know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal
court determination forum non conveniens is not binding
in a state court, but supposing in this case that the
parties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want
to sue there. Would the San Francisco court, the United
States District Court feel bound by the determination
that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that
the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think there are two
components to your question, Justice Kennedy, and let me
see if I can answer both of them. The first is whether
the determination that the Federal court in
Philadelphia, for example, in this case, was an
inconvenient forum. Would that determination be binding
on the court in San Francisco? Our view would be
probably not. It would be persuasive in that case, but
the forum non conveniens --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the ruling that
this would be governed by Chinese law and that the
Chinese court is the best forum to consider that? That
too has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in
Philadelphia?
MR. CASTANIAS: Let me -- that was the
second part of your question that I was going to try to
answer. And with regard to that, I think that it would
not have preclusive effect in the main -- in the mine
run of cases. And the reason I think it wouldn't have
preclusive effect is that it would be one factor in what
this Court has described as a multifarious analysis
under the forum non conveniens analysis at American
Dredging, and so it would be hard to say that for issue
preclusion, for example, that the choice of law
determination in that case was necessary to the ruling
dismissing the case.
Now one might imagine a case at the margins
where that was the case and there might be a case for
preclusive effect, but that's, I think, not likely to be
presented by this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know any case,
Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non
conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where
the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different
U.S. court to get a different resolution?
MR. CASTANIAS: And by U.S. court you mean
Federal court like Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, or
perhaps a state court as well?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Either one.
MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think I have seen
cases, and I can't cite them to you as I stand here
right now, where litigants have tried to go to a state
court. Another Federal Court, I can't think of a single
one. I'm hard pressed to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you were urging
that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do
with the merits; but there is an argument that the
existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have
some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.
MR. CASTANIAS: In some cases, I suppose
that could be true, Justice Ginsburg; but the point of
our rule is that the only issue presented by this case
is that of Federal court power. There may be a case
where it is appropriate in the district court's
discretion. In fact in Ruhrgas, you writing for the
Court pointed out that the normal court order business
is to determine subject matter jurisdiction first and
then personal jurisdiction.
But the point of our application of that
rule in this case is there may be some cases where it's
appropriate, and this is a paradigmatic example of the
sort of case where it would be appropriate to decide the
forum non conveniens issue first, before personal
jurisdiction. I hope that satisfies -- I hope that's an
answer to your question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
MR. CASTANIAS: With regard to the body of
this Court's decisions, we cited in our briefs cases
like Leroy against Great Western, which holds that a
Federal court can decide venue before deciding personal
jurisdiction.
In this case it's hardly different because
again, as American Dredging pointed out, forum non
conveniens is properly described as a supervening venue
provision. The Gold Law case which we cite in our reply
brief, and the solicitor general relies on, says that
Federal courts have the power to transfer a case before
determining personal jurisdiction. And grants even more
analogous here are the extension in the Tenet case. In
the case of extension, extension documents have very
similar, though different, moorings as the forum non
conveniens doctrine. And they're both discretionary
decisions to decline to exercise jurisdiction.
This Court pointed out, citing the Ellis
case, and it pointed this out in the Steel Company,
Ruhrgas and Tenet cases that extension can be decided
first. And again, applying that precedent to the case
of forum non conveniens, it's -- it really does follow
that forum non conveniens can be decided first.
With regard to the Tenet case, that case is
very close to a merits issue, perhaps even one might
call it a merits issue, but it was so threshold that it
was appropriate to decide the totten bar that was at
issue in that case before jurisdiction.
Again, and with all of these lines of cases,
deciding forum non conveniens first will have -- will
provide no chance of the Federal court going beyond its
constitutionally and statutorily exercised powers.
Now, I'd like to leave the Court with one
final thought about the way this, and the importance of
applying this rule in this case.
The complaint that Malaysia International
Shipping makes against Sinochem is nothing more than a
claim that Sinochem defrauded a Chinese court. There is
a term used in the complaint, a fraudulent
misrepresentation. The term negligent misrepresentation
is also used. But make no mistake about it. The
complaint in this case is that Sinochem made a
misrepresentation to Chinese courts. This is precisely
the sort of interference with the Chinese court system
which has proceeded to judgment, and judgment by the way
on these issues in favor of Sinochem and against
Malaysia International, that really cries out for the
flexibility inherent in our rule.
Unless the Court has further questions, I'll
reserve the balance of my time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: One question that doesn't
even have to do with the issue before us. I'm curious
about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there
was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate. What
happened to that?
MR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the
last part of your question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an agreement to
arbitrate. And we're talking about a suit brought by
one party in the United States, by the other party in
China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although
I thought the contract called for it.
MR. CASTANIAS: My understanding,
Justice Ginsburg, and this is a vague recollection from
one aspect of the record, is that the arbitration clause
was held not to apply in this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not an
exercise of law declaring authority on the merits?
MR. CASTANIAS: Oh, I'm sorry. To be clear,
Mr. Chief Justice, it was not held by the district court
in this case to not apply. That issue was not in front
of it. But at the time --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the
district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?
MR. CASTANIAS: Yes, correct. I think, I
think that, I think it was agreed by the parties or
understood by the Chinese court. My memory on this with
regard to the record, maybe background facts that are
not in the record but I, on summing it up, are a little
be fuzzy. But I think to answer your question,
Mr. Chief Justice, there, in abstention, an -- an
arbitration clause I think provides a closer question
than this case does for an issue of whether it's law
declaring authority, I think as your question put it.
It's arguable that an arbitration clause is
little more than a, in essence, a forum selection clause
of the same kind that a venue provision or a forum non
conveniens ruling might provide.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been the
allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the
arbitration clause did not apply?
MR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry. The first part
of your question I had trouble --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been the
allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the
arbitration clause did not apply.
MR. CASTANIAS: That -- it may be. I just,
I don't have that ruling in front of me.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how that court
would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.
MR. CASTANIAS: Again, we'll reserve the
remainder of our time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In Steel Company the Court held that it is
impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over
which the Court may lack jurisdiction. But it is
another thing entirely for the Court to decline to
exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess. In
Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already
quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds
for denying audience to a case on the merits.
Now, the dividing line between a threshold
non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases
be difficult. And the Court has -- members of the Court
have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set
of cases and that is where the Court is declining to
exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it
is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive
dispute in another forum.
And this Court has -- has decided already
that it is permissible, for example, for a court to
decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before
deciding a difficult question of whether it would
possess subject matter jurisdiction over the
supplemental claims at all.
Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an
abstention extension doctrine. In Gulf Oil, one of the
first cases of this Court to describe the forum non
conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum
non conveniens to a Burford abstention. The Court even
in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds
of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide
before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Gulf Oil case
does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal
presupposes that the forum is one in which there's
personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue. It's
just another forum is more appropriate.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's, that's
right, Your Honor. And the Court said so in the course
of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded
that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern
District of New York, that the doctrine of forum non
conveniens could not apply.
The Court said that couldn't be so, because
the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the
availability of two fora. But the Court did not address
the entirely separate question of whether the Court
could assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would
not exercise it. And --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was not, not
felicitously put. I think all the Court was saying was
that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non
conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction.
The only point of the doctrine is to get rid
of the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction.
And so you do not have to -- but that
doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before
you can exercise the doctrine. It is a doctrine that
overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction. In
that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That -- that's
right, Your Honor. And in the court already determined
it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was
improper, then forum non conveniens would have no work
to do. But Gulf Oil certainly didn't address this
question of the ordering of these restful matters. And
of course the doctrine of forum non conveniens, its
entire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more
convenient and appropriate forum, and it would undermine
severely the purposes of the doctrine --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand
your argument to be that, that in this case it happened
to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than
subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same
argument if it were a doubt about subject matter
jurisdiction?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, we
would. And, and one of the cases that Ruhrgas quoted
and relies on was the D.C. Circuit's decision in --
Papandreou, which involved subject matter jurisdiction
under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And there
the Court quite rightly said that it would be improper
to force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive
jurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear
that at the end of the day the Court would dismiss day
in favor of a foreign forum in any event. So it would
apply to, to questions of subject matter jurisdiction as
well as personal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can a district court
do both? Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction,
I conclude that I, we do not have jurisdiction over this
case? And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non
conveniens grounds if it turns out we do?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think they could
do both. The second would be really superfluous.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not if there's,
I presume, if there's an appeal.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If -- if -- an
appeal, the court could, the court of appeals could
affirm on either ground.
Again, to emphasize the point that counsel
has made, the argument here is not that forum non
conveniens must necessarily be decided before
jurisdictional questions. In fact, the natural order
would be to decide jurisdictional issues first.
But as the Court held in the analogous
circumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are
circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that
order, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue
or, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden
of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or
foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the
end in any event.
If the Court has no further questions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Martin, in the
hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non
conveniens and then they go to another Federal district
court, could the second Federal district court say this
has already been heard by the first district court; I'm
not getting into it? Or, or does that district court
have, have to go through the motion again?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think the
second court would have to at the very least ascertain
that circumstances had not changed or that there weren't
relevant difference of facts. Your, your hypothetical
earlier was of filing, refiling this suit in California.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why is that? Now --
to some extent this is a call for the district judge.
There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's
entirely conceivable that one district judge would
correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens
whereas another district judge faced with the same
question would not do so. And both of them would be
acting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is in the nature
of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says,
that -- that different judges could reach different
decisions. In the Parsons case, Parsons versus
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there
the question was whether a state court's forum non
conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a
Federal court's analysis of the factors. And this Court
held that did it not. In large part because it's
impossible to know that every factor would be the same
or would be weighed the same by the second court.
And so I think it would be open to the
second court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it
weren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I
don't think that that undermines our position, because
it is, of course, equally true of other threshold
determinations such as personal and subject matter
jurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects
in subsequent litigations.
For example, a trial court could decide that
it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount
in controversy is insufficient because under state law,
the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive
damage. That determination would be given
issue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by
the same plaintiff in another district court. In fact
Justice Scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the
D.C. Circuit in the Dozier versus Ford Motor Company.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hallward-Driemeier,
because your time is running out, there is a question
about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing
on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's
common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens
dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the
defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and
other conditions. If the Court has no personal
jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to
impose such conditions; isn't that so?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Our understanding
of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that
the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of
the world, and that -- and facts as they bear upon its
analysis, such as is the defendant subject to
jurisdiction in a foreign forum. Oftentimes, the
plaintiff -- if I could answer -- oftentime the
plaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue
the defendant in the foreign forum. The defendant
agrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction. That
understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal.
If it later proves to be untrue because the defendant
objects to jurisdiction of the foreign court, it would
be open to the plaintiff to seek to reopen the first
suit on that ground.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Ms. Higgins.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN-MICHELE G. HIGGINS,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. HIGGINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
We believe that this Court should affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
based on three reasons.
We believe that personal jurisdiction is a
requirement articulated in Gulf Oil versus Gilbert which
remains before this judicially created doctrine may be
evaluated.
Second, we believe that adopting the Third
Circuit holding establishes a clear, bright line
discrete rule that is easy to enforce and appropriate to
evaluate at any other appellate level.
And third, we argue that the nature of the
doctrine of forum non conveniens itself presupposes
jurisdiction before making a ruling to dismiss for some
other convenient forum.
The analysis that has brought the case to
this Court has included a divergence of opinions between
various circuit courts. In the briefing, all parties
tend to agree that forum non conveniens is a
non-merits-based ground for evaluating a ruling. The
Fifth Circuit has decided otherwise. We, we express
some issue with the fact that in looking at a forum non
conveniens analysis, the Court necessarily, as the
Government has conceded in its brief, takes a peek at
the merits of the dispute.
The other issue that arises is that if a
court dismisses a case based on forum non conveniens,
and then an appeal is sought, the appellate court always
has the opportunity to evaluate both the subject matter
jurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction.
The Seventh Circuit in the Intek versus
Engle case, came up with such a ruling recently. They
expressed support for the Second Circuit and the D.C.
Circuit, saying that it is appropriate to be able to
deal with non-threshold matters such as forum non
conveniens without ascertaining jurisdiction. In fact,
the court acknowledged that they thought the dicta
expressed in the Ruhrgas opinion would become the
holding of this Court.
However, for judicial efficiency, it decided
to go through the analysis to determine whether or not
there was personal jurisdiction in the case. It went
through subject matter of the case and personal
jurisdiction, and it determined that there was no
jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that only proved that
an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the
ground relied upon by the district court, even if the
ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid
ground. It's up to an appellate court -- - it's
available to an appellate court, especially where the
ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into
jurisdiction and say there isn't any. I don't know, I
don't know how that adds to your case.
MS. HIGGINS: Justice Scalia, I think it's
appropriate. Both parties cite the vast waste of
judicial resources that would occur if forum non
conveniens had to establish personal jurisdiction first.
And frankly, we see that as the other way. The Insight
case in our opinion --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you found one
appellate court that chose to do it that way. Frankly,
if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it
that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground
was valid.
MS. HIGGINS: Well, I tend to agree with you
on that point as well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MS. HIGGINS: -- with it. But I think what
the Third Circuit was stressing in its opinion is that
you cannot subject the parties to litigate in another
forum if there is some chance that your own forum does
not have the personal jurisdiction. It is a
prerequisite of the doctrine itself.
And we believe that --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.
We talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the
litigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more
fundamental problem with the procedure that the Third
Circuit followed here. That is, is there really a case
or controversy down there? Does the defendant have any
motivation to spend a lot of money fighting about
jurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be
transferred anyway? Is this a real live controversy on
the issue that's left open?
MS. HIGGINS: I think it is,
Justice Stevens, and I think the Court would address
that by saying certainly on the negligent
misrepresentation claim at this stage the record
indicates that there was a ruling in China, but the
appellate window is still open. And certainly the
evidence has long gone into the Chinese case. Those are
completely separate issues.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There couldn't be any
question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction
here, because it, in fact, had. A proceeding was
ongoing in China. So you brought up the question about
the Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum
non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient
forum doesn't take the case. But that can't be a factor
in this case, where the other forum was in China and was
indeed litigating the case.
MS. HIGGINS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg; but as
practical matter, with the resolution of this case by
this Court we would certainly have to start the process,
whatever ruling this Court finds, all over again. We
certainly cannot participate in the action in China
because that has already gone on. We would have the
option to participate in the case in the United States
because those specific issues were not litigated in
China.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. I'm not
following you, so please straighten me out. I thought
that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on
the Chinese court.
MS. HIGGINS: That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your claim was that a
fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in
connection with the arrest of this vessel and the
ensuing proceedings?
MS. HIGGINS: That is correct,
Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, why in the world
should a court in the United States get involved in
determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese
court?
MS. HIGGINS: Justice Ginsburg, we believe
it was appropriate for U.S. review because of the
balancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the
case because of the bills of ladings. Although the
district court believed that Chinese law would apply to
the contract for the sale of the steel coils, in fact we
would make the argument that with the various charter
parties in the case, including the bill of lading that
you reference, indeed American law would apply and there
would be some different issues that would be evaluated.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: American law to determine
whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court?
It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to
the Chinese court to have another court determine
whether it had been defrauded.
MS. HIGGINS: That would have been a
concern, Justice Ginsburg, except that issue was brought
up expressly before the Chinese court; and if I may
refer you to page 18 of the joint appendix, the Chinese
court ruled that, quote, "Given that the People's
Republic of China and the U.S. are different
sovereignties with different jurisdictions, whether the
appellant has taken actions at any U.S. court in respect
of this case will have no effect on the exercise by a
Chinese court of its competent jurisdiction over said
case."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that was a very
polite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care
what the United States court is doing; we've got this
case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate
it; and it doesn't matter. We don't have to say
anything to the United States to chastise it for even
thinking it could become involved in this matter. It
was polite.
MS. HIGGINS: And I agree with you, Your
Honor, except it is the only indication in the record
that there is some foreign nation that has expressed an
opinion on this. If you read the brief by the Solicitor
General, the Government would have us think that every
single case is going to involve foreign nations and
delicate foreign policy disputes and such other factors.
Very clearly, there is no such evidence in
the record and the only evidence we do have is from
another sovereign, China, that says if you have a U.S.
cause of action we have no problem if a U.S. court
adjudicates it on the merits.
Having said that, the issue here was whether
or not personal jurisdiction should have been decided
before the forum non conveniens. And again, we would
just go back to our second point, where the court
believes that it can't evaluate a doctrine without
having -- if it's a required factor of the doctrine that
a sitting court making a ruling on that issue has to
presuppose personal jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- I mean, I
assume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that
there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that
judgment would assume that there was personal
jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that
into the mix. Assuming we have personal jurisdiction,
is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum? And if the
court can say yes, that's the end of the game.
I don't see what you have to gain here.
Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction
and dismisses for forum non conveniens? What, what --
what are you gambling for here? I don't understand
what's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to
achieve?
MS. HIGGINS: Well, for Malaysia
International the desirable outcome would be upholding
the Third Circuit opinion. It then gets remanded to the
district court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and the district
court at best for you, at best, finds personal
jurisdiction. If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you
know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum
non conveniens. If it finds personal jurisdiction, it
would say: Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I
assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed
it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same
call that I made before. Dismissed for forum non
conveniens.
MS. HIGGINS: And Justice Scalia, I concede
that, but you would also have the ability of the
defendant to waive personal jurisdiction. Again, you
get into the judicial resources. The defendant could
choose to waive it at that point in time and then I am
right back again --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would a defendant
that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive
jurisdiction? It seems to me that there is something in
this picture that is to your advantage and that is if
you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do
personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on
that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens
without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not
going to get that discovery.
MS. HIGGINS: That is correct, Your Honor,
and then I would have to look for an evaluation of forum
non conveniens that was favorable to the client. That
was one of the issues that we raised on appeal to the
Third Circuit; and the court did not make a ruling on
that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but discovery for its
own sake is no fun. What does discovery for its own
sake achieve?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless there's something at
the end of the discovery. Now, maybe what you hoped is
that the Republic of China would not accede to the
discovery and therefore, you would get a default
judgment or something. You know, I just -- I just don't
see what's at the end of this game for you.
MS. HIGGINS: That's one possibility. But
again, we talked about the policy issues of why the
Government came in with the position they did. They
suggested that the United States had a very distinct
interest in avoiding delay, burdensome discovery, and
difficult legal issues; and frankly, my thought is the
same as yours. Any party has those desires to avoid
those issues and come to a ruling in their favor.
In this case we would hope that with an
adoption of personal jurisdiction first, then the court
would be required to rule on our motion to reevaluate
forum non conveniens and we might be able to convince
the court to be able to pursuit the case here. In this
particular case, that is the goal that we seek because
that is, as you say, all we have to do at the end of the
game with it.
I also wanted to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we should ask the
other side, but I think I know what their answer will
be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of
forum non conveniens without first addressing personal
jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal
jurisdiction? And what do you think?
MS. HIGGINS: I think it has to, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I agree.
MS. HIGGINS: The Seventh Circuit case --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree. So how are you
going to get a different result then when it goes back
and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal
jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the
district court says, oh, yeah, same result.
MS. HIGGINS: But there is the possibility
of a case happening, as it happened in the In Re
Bridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case. In
that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens
and the -- I believe it dealt with the country of
Mexico. The parties had obtained a ruling in Mexico
saying that the Mexican courts were not to take
jurisdiction of the case. Under those circumstances the
court was required to take back the case because it no
longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate
the dispute. So I think that's the one example of the
case that you raise.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we know that that's
not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has
adjudicated the case.
MS. HIGGINS: Not on this issue, Your Honor,
and actually not on the bills of lading issue. You did
raise that point and there is still the potential of
arbitration taking place under the various charter
parties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the
remaining parties in the action. So that matter is
still open as well.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're dealing with,
because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum
non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406. And you are
treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is
forum non conveniens. But 1406 is wrong venue and, as
you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court
can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction
and is a place of improper venue.
Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens
doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of
1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't
need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue,
you just transfer it to a place where those conditions
exist?
MS. HIGGINS: I think, Your Honor, in that
case, it's -- as the doctrine developed, the difference
lies in the statutory framework of the 1404 versus the
judicially created version of the forum non conveniens.
I think you're correct that as forum non
conveniens exists today, side by side with 1404, you
certainly have the limited application that it will
apply to only foreign nations or to a State court. And
that's what I thought was the benefit of creating a rule
that's rather limited in scope, that will not touch many
other factors. It can be discrete. It can be applied
easily. And that comports with Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure 1. We thought that was one of the reasons why
a finding by this Court would be able to ease the
administration of cases along those lines.
If the Court has no other questions, I
certainly would urge that, based on precedent and logic
and the terms of the doctrine of forum non conveniens
itself, that the ruling of the Third Circuit be upheld.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Higgins.
Mr. Castanias, you have 9 minutes remaining.
