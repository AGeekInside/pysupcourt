MILLER BAKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe principal question before the Court\ntoday is whether nonparties to an arbitration agreement\nthat are otherwise entitled to enforce that agreement\nunder State law are foreclosed as a matter of law from\nseeking relief under section 3 of the Federal\nArbitration Act.\nRespondents' argument that section 3\nforecloses such relief to nonparties is contrary to both\nthe text of section 3 and the structure of the FAA.\nNothing in the text of section 3 forecloses nonparty\nenforcement rights, and under the structure of the Act\nsection 3 is a procedural device to enforce, rather than\na substantive limitation upon, State law arbitration\nrights made applicable by section 2.\nI'll begin with the text of section 3.\nUnder section 3, a stay is mandatory if the issue in\nsuit is, quote, \"referable to arbitration under such an\nagreement.\" We contend that there are three elements\nthat determine whether or not an issue is referable to\narbitration under the agreement. First, the applicant\nmust be able to enforce the agreement. Second, the\nplaintiff must be bound by the agreement. And, third,\nthe claim must fall within the scope of the agreement.\nNothing in section 3 limits who can enforce\nthe agreement. To answer that question we have to turn\nto section 2.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you leave the\ntext, it says as you -- \"referable to arbitration under\nan agreement,\" but then it says \"shall on application of\none of the parties.\" How do we know whether that is\nparties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration\nagreement?\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, it's -- it's clear\nfrom the -- from the context it's referring to parties\nto the action. Likewise, in section 4 there's a\nreference to parties, and it's parties to the\ncontroversy. So section 3 refers to parties to the\naction in which the section 3 stay is sought. Section\n4, likewise, the companion enforcement provision, refers\nto parties to the controversy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what -- what is\nthe \"controversy\"? Is it the controversy asserted to be\nsubject to arbitration or something else?\nMR. BAKER: Well, \"controversy\" is in -- in\nsection 4, Your Honor, as opposed to section 3. But the\ncontroversy in this case is a tort claim against various\ndefendants. And that -- the Petitioners in this case\nassert that they are entitled to enforce the arbitration\nclause, and under that clause this controversy is\nsupposed to be arbitrated.\nNow, section 2 is the primary substantive\nprovision of the Act. Section 2 establishes that\nquestions concerning the enforceability of an\narbitration agreement, including who may enforce that\nagreement, are decided by State law. This Court's\ndecision in Perry v. Thomas recognized and applied this\nprinciple.\nIn Perry this Court remanded to State court\nto decide the question of whether nonparties could\nenforce an arbitration agreement. In so doing, this\nCourt instructed the lower court to apply State law to\ndetermine the very question that's before this case,\nwhether non -- before this Court, whether nonparties\ncould enforce the arbitration agreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In practice, are there\ndecisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are\nright on the jurisdictional question -- in which a\nnonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the\nlitigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay\nunder section 3?\nI mean, one question is -- and that's the\nquestion on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a\nparty to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration\nagreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the\naction pending arbitration. Have there been cases in\nwhich section 3 stays have been issued on the request of\nsomeone who is not party to the arbitration agreement\nbut is a litigant in the case?\nMR. BAKER: Yes, there have been, Your\nHonor. And there -- there are numerous cases. In fact,\nfor the last 60 years it has been a recognized, settled\nprinciple of FAA law that nonparties to an arbitration\nagreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce the\nagreement are able to seek and obtain stays under\nsection 3.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the question --\nability is one thing. It means they -- they have the\ncapacity to apply under section 3. I was just wondering\nhow in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have\nthree parties together counseling a certain tax shelter.\nOne of them enters an arbitration agreement with the\nenterprise that they are advising. The other two,\nsophisticated players, do not.\nMy question is, conceding jurisdiction, it\nseems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two\nsuch people who were perfectly equipped to get an\narbitration agreement themselves and didn't.\nMR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, it depends\nupon the facts and the law. It may well be that those\nnonparties have no arbitration rights, in which case a\nsection 3 stay would not be available -- available to\nthem.\nThe question is whether they have rights\nunder State law. If they do have rights under State law\nto enforce the arbitration agreement to which they are\nnot parties, then they are entitled to a section 3 stay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't see that the\n-- that the section 3 stay follows from that. It may\nvery well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is\nthrashed out in that the -- that the nonsignatories will\nbe able to enforce the arbitration agreement.\nThe question here is whether they can get a\nstay in midstream in order to litigate that as a\nseparate issue. And one argument for saying that they\nshould not, that the stay right should be limited to\nsignatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal\nArbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements.\nIt is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under\nall possible circumstances. It is a policy to enforce\ncontracts because the contracts, in effect, were being\ngiven short shrift before the act was passed.\nIf the policy is one to enforce contracts\nand, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make\nan arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then\nthat is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not\nstay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who\ndidn't get the agreement that that person could have\ngotten. What is your answer to that argument?\nMR. BAKER: Section 2, Your Honor, sets the\npolicy of the FAA, and section 2 establishes that State\nlaw determines the rights and obligations of nonparties\nto an arbitration agreement. If nonparties have rights\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Including -- and -- and\nyou're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point\nof Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical\nterms, an interlocutory appeal. That's a question of\nState law?\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, that brings us to\nthe question of appellate jurisdiction, but first let me\ndeal with the merits. Section 3, as this Court has\nrecognized on various occasions, is a procedural device\nto enforce the substantive policy of section 2. It has\nno substantive component on its own.\nSection 2 establishes -- settles the\nquestion of who may enforce or is bound by an\narbitration agreement. It settles that question by\ndirecting a court to look to State law. Section 3 is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the question here is:\nWhat is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court\nwhen there is disagreement about that? And to say that\nthat is a question of State law strikes me as a stretch.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, section 3 is a\nprocedural device to enforce State law arbitration\nrights. Section -- likewise, section 4 is the same\nthing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that section\n2 -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says\nState law determines whether somebody not a party to the\narbitration agreement can -- can enforce it.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, that was the reading\nof this Court in the Perry v. Thomas decision in 1987.\nThis Court construed section 2 as being a touchstone for\nchoice of law and that section 2 required the court\nconcerning questions concerning the enforceability of an\narbitration agreement to look to State law to answer\nthose questions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Including enforceability by\nwhom?\nMR. BAKER: Absolutely. That was the\nprecise question before the court in Perry and this\nCourt remanded to the California Court of Appeals to\ndetermine whether nonsignatories to an arbitration\nagreement could enforce that agreement. The California\nCourt of Appeals on remand held that they could under a\ntheory of agency, which is indistinguishable in\nprinciple from the theory that Petitioners are asserting\nhere today.\nRespondents' theory, their interpretation of\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, would wipe out six decades\nof FAA case law recognizing that nonparties have\nenforcement rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any\nsituation -- and this one is really peculiar because the\none party who has the arbitration agreement with\nCarlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back\nin, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there\nis an automatic stay of any litigation against\nBricolage.\nThe one party that has the arbitration\nagreement is out of the picture, so you have an\narbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two\nparties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to\nenforce: The difference between parties to the\nlitigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by\neither party to the arbitration agreement, and relying\non an arbitration agreement effectively without two\nparties to it.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, the bankruptcy of\nBricolage has no effect whatsoever on our rights under\nState law to enforce the agreement. It is what it is,\nbut --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you have a party\nto the agreement who is no longer in the picture,\ndoesn't that change things?\nMR. BAKER: Well, the Respondents might --\nmight contend so, and they -- they are free to argue on\nremand the question of whether or not that bankruptcy in\nany way affects our rights, whether we can prevail under\nequitable estoppel in this case. But for purposes of\nthis Court, the question that we -- that the Court has\nto decide is whether or not as a matter of law a\nnonparty is foreclosed from seeking relief under section\n3, and section 3 does not foreclose such relief because\nsection 2 establishes the principle that this -- that a\ncourt is to look to State law to determine the question\nof who can enforce an arbitration agreement.\nSo we're saying that Respondents' theory of\nthe case would wipe out 60 years of FAA case law\nrecognizing that nonparties have arbitration rights.\nTheories such as third party beneficiary, assignment,\nagency, estoppel, including equitable estoppel,\nassumption, successor in interest, none of those cases\ncan survive effectively if this Court were to affirm the\ndecision of the Sixth Circuit.\nI will now turn to section 16 and the\nquestion of appellate jurisdiction. Respondents, like\nthe court below, erroneously conflate the merits of the\nsection 3 issue with appellate jurisdiction. Thus if\nyou reject their interpretation of section 3,\nnecessarily their appellate jurisdiction argument fails.\nBut that -- their theory of appellate jurisdiction\nnevertheless should be rejected on its own merits.\nUnder section 16, and that's found at page 3\nof the blue brief -- an appeal may be taken from an\norder refusing a stay of any action under this title.\nThis establishes a broad category of orders that are\nimmediately appealable. The Sixth Circuit below used a\nsignatory test to determine whether it had appellate\njurisdiction. Now, this test is legally erroneous, as\nthe Respondents concede. For 70 years -- should be 80\nyears -- the Federal Arbitration Act has been understood\nnot to contain a signatory requirement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you this?\nLet's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize\nstays at this stage of the game. Therefore, we will not\ngive a stay to anyone. Would State law prevail?\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, State law controls\nthe question of who may enforce the agreement, who has\nrights and obligations under the agreement. Sections 3\nand 4 control the question of whether relief is\navailable in Federal court. The procedural devices to\nenforce State law arbitration rights may vary from State\nto Federal Court, but the principle of who --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that the problem?\nThat's what I'm getting at. Isn't that the problem for\nyou in this case? Because you keep arguing that their\nsubstantive rights under the agreement are issues of\nState law, but the question before us is not one of\nultimate substantive right. At some point there will be\nan -- an appellate process open to them and they can\nassert those substantive rights if they didn't get them\nat trial.\nThe issue here is not substantive right.\nThe issue here is a procedural right, and it's a\nprocedural right which depends upon the terms of the\nFederal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it\nmay very well be that the Federal statute determines not\nonly the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for\nit, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a\nState question.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, the premise of your\nquestion drives a wedge between section 2 and section 3\nthat is inconsistent with this Court's -- Court's\ndecision in Bernhardt. This Court in Bernhardt said\nthat section 3 cannot be read apart from section 2.\nSection -- this Court has never characterized section 3\nor section 4 as containing any substantive elements.\nSuch --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And your argument depends\nupon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago,\nreading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law\nfor purposes of determining substantive rights.\nMR. BAKER: It absolutely does.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that still begs\nthe question whether the -- whether the incorporation of\nState law to determine substantive rights controls the\nquestion of what law determines procedural rights, when\na Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is\ninvolved here.\nMR. BAKER: That's -- that's correct. And\nsections -- it is a Federal question as to what sections\n3 and 4 require.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And regardless of State law\nthe answer to the Federal question is independent of it.\nMR. BAKER: That's not correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then I'm -- I'm missing the\nlogic of your argument.\nMR. BAKER: The logic of the argument is\nthat section 3 and section 4, as this Court has said on\nseveral occasions, are devices to enforce the principle\nof arbitration enforceability outlined in section 2.\nSection 2 establishes the substantive principle here.\nSections 3 and 4 are mere procedural devices. Under --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they are Federal\nprocedural devices and State law could not contradict\nthem. That's -- that's what we got into when I said\nwhat if State law said there could be no stay? You\nagree at that point that of course the Federal law would\nprevail?\nMR. BAKER: That would apply to -- that\nwould apply to the question of the -- the action in that\ncourt, but in the Federal court the threshold --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would apply to what the\njudge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody\nsays, I want a stay. And the judge at that point\nconsults Federal law, not State law, doesn't he?\nMR. BAKER: That -- on the procedural\nquestion of what procedural mechanism --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, just stick to my\nquestion. He says: I want a stay. Does the judge look\nto State law or Federal law?\nMR. BAKER: The judge first looks to the\nquestion of who can enforce the agreement, and to ask\nthat -- to answer that question, the judge has to look\nto State law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that necessarily so?\nI don't understand your answer to that question, or your\nstatement that your argument is dependent on the\nresolution of that choice of law issue.\nAre the courts of appeals unanimous on the\nquestion of whether the enforceability of an arbitration\nagreement by a nonparty is a question of State law? I\nthink there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that\nsays it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do\nwe have to decide that and why is your argument\ndependent on it?\nSuppose that is, suppose that were a\nquestion of Federal law, what would that -- it might\nchange the ultimate outcome of whether there's an\nentitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any\neffect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction.\nMR. BAKER: I don't think it has any\nquestion -- effect on the question of jurisdiction, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Nor does it mean that you\nnecessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement,\ndoes it?\nMR. BAKER: It means that -- well, you have\nto look to a source of law to determine whether a\nnonparty has rights under an arbitration agreement. I'm\naware of that Fourth Circuit case. Your Honor, I\nbelieve that the court was incorrect. I believe this\nCourt's decisions in Perry and ensuing cases make it\nclear that State law determines the rights and\nobligations of nonparties to an arbitration agreement.\nThat's a settled principle. And so that is a threshold\nquestion that has to be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you read section\n3, if you interpret, as you do, the word \"parties\" to\nmean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of\njurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party\nto the litigation? Yes. End of case; they can move for\na stay. Then whether they're entitled to one because of\nthis equitable estoppel theory which is determined by\nthe State law is a merits question.\nYou are making a more complex jurisdictional\nargument than I understand. What's wrong with the\nsimple argument that section 3 says parties; that means\nparties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here\nare parties to the litigation. Therefore, they can move\nfor a stay of the arbitration. And then we go to the\nmerits and say, do they have a good reason for staying\nthe arbitration?\nBut you're presenting a more complex\nargument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite\nunderstand.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm not sure I\nunderstand the question. Are you referring to appellate\njurisdiction or jurisdiction under the FAA?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: First, is there\njurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction. If you --\nif there's an application to stay, is that appealable?\nWhy isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes?\nMR. BAKER: The answer, Your Honor, is\nclearly yes. If we're talking about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your step -- you seem\nto be involving some merits question of State law in\nthat question.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, I turned to the\nmerits first because the Sixth Circuit below erroneously\nconflated two entirely distinct concepts. The first is\nappellate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You shouldn't do that.\nYou should tell us, this is the jurisdictional argument.\nIf we pass that threshold, then we get to the merits.\nMR. BAKER: All right. Well, I'll start\nwith jurisdiction, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Good.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAKER: All right. Section 16 makes it\nclear that all one needs to have for appellate\njurisdiction is a motion under section 3 for a stay\npending appeal, and that is denied. That establishes a\nbroad category of orders. The Sixth Circuit didn't\napply that text. The Sixth Circuit used a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask -- may I ask?\nSuppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation\nbut is not a party either to the arbitration agreement\nor to the litigation?\nMR. BAKER: If a -- if a party -- if a\nlitigant makes a section 3 stay and they claim no right\nto enforce the arbitration agreement, that denial of\nthat stay would be appealable, all right, because\nsection 16 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking of somebody\nwho is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an\ninterested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to\nwhich that person is not a party, and the court says of\ncourse not. Would that be reviewable on appeal?\nMR. BAKER: No, because they -- the\nspectator is not even a party, Your Honor, to the\nlitigation. Section 3 contemplates parties to the\nlitigation seeking a stay.\nOn the question of appellate jurisdiction,\nif a litigant makes a request for a section 3 stay and\nthe stay request is denied, there is clearly appellate\njurisdiction under section 16. That is -- in our view.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's your\njurisdictional argument.\nMR. BAKER: That's our jurisdictional\nargument. The mere request for relief under section 3\nand the denial of that request triggers appellate\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you're saying that's\nall that's before us because it was thrown out --\nMR. BAKER: That's not all that's before\nyou. The Sixth Circuit below conflated the question of\nwhether there's appellate jurisdiction with whether non-\nsignatories can seek relief under section 3. That's why\nit's essential for the Court to reach the second\nquestioned presented, which is whether non-signatories\nas a matter of law are foreclosed from seeking relief\nunder section 3.\nThe court below -- I'll turn back to\nappellate jurisdiction to -- Your Honor. The court\nbelow used a fact-based test; that is, is the party\nseeking relief a signatory to the agreement? That --\nthat cannot be the law. Eighty years of FAA law\nestablishes that you don't have to be a signatory to\nenforce an arbitration agreement. In addition, it\nviolates this Court's rule that you look to categories\nof orders, rather than the facts of a given case in some\nappellate jurisdictions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the instances in\nwhich somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have\na right to enforce it? I can think of one. Suppose\nhe's a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Are\nthere others?\nMR. BAKER: Well, absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. BAKER: There's assignment, successor in\ninterest, assumption, estoppel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. BAKER: There's a whole --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, which one applies\nhere?\nMR. BAKER: Well, estoppel, and there are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Estoppel? I don't\nunderstand estoppel.\nMR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, it's a theory\nthat was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know what estoppel is in\nthe law.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAKER: More precisely, it's equitable\nestoppel, but the -- the practice treatises have entire\nchapters devoted to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I haven't\nunfortunately had a chance to read all the practice\ntreatises. So could you explain to me quite simply what\nis the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone\nwho is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to\nhave it enforced?\nMR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor. The theory\nhere is that the Respondents asserted claims of -- of\nconcerted misconduct, of conspiracy against the\nPetitioners, some of whom were -- one of -- well, none\nof whom were signatories to the arbitration agreement in\nBricolage which did -- was a signatory to the agreement,\nthat claim of concerted misconduct, in our view, where\nthe Respondents are relying upon the agreement, that is\nthe agreement that they entered into with Bricolage to\n-- is a theory upon which they are now seeking relief\nfrom us. They are claiming that this contract that\ncontains the arbitration clause was an instrumentality\nfor the fraud that was perpetrated on them. Because of\nthat they are now estopped from seeking, claiming that\nthey are not -- not obligated to arbitrate under the\nagreement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, whenever I\nsign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I\nask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and\nthere's an arbitration clause. And now I sue all kinds\nof other people, and the contract is part of the\nlawsuit. Are there many cases like that? Maybe it was\na shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to,\nand he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the\ncontract. Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go\nto see Smith in the first place. Maybe -- I don't know.\nThere are a lot of people. So, now all those people\nhave to go to arbitration?\nBecause you're saying whenever I go in and\nhave a contract with X and there's an arbitration\nclause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody\nand that contract is an essential part of it, the breach\nthereof, he could put me in arbitration. Boy, that\nsounds extreme. I mean, I guess there are -- there'd\nhave to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't\nsound intuitively sensible.\nMR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, we're not\nsaying that that applies in every case. There's more --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. That's all I\nwanted to know is what's the theory in this case.\nMR. BAKER: The theory of equitable\nestoppel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's the theory, I --\nunless I think it always applies, I could just say I\ndon't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just have to decide\nwhether you can enforce it. Now -- so you'd better say\nsome other things.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, one of --\nMR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, give me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the things you're\ngoing to say is that, with all due respect, Justice\nBreyer, this conflates the merits with the\njurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake\nthat the court of appeals made. Is that your theory of\nthe case?\nMR. BAKER: Well, that's -- that's the first\nerror of the court of appeals, but the court of -- the\nsecond error of the court of appeals was to decide --\nwas to hold as a matter of law that section 3 does not\nallow nonparties to enforce an arbitration agreement.\nThe question of the merits of equitable\nestoppel is not before this court, Your Honor, and it\nmay well be on remand in the Sixth Circuit that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't have asked my\nquestion if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the\nquestion whether they had jurisdiction and answer the\nmerits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now you're saying, no, we\ndon't.\nMR. BAKER: Your Honor, the merits -- there\nare two parts to the merits. The first is whether as a\nmatter of law nonparties are foreclosed from seeking\nrelief under section 3. That -- that is all this Court\nneed decide. That is what the question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I could just rely on my\nthird-party beneficiary example?\nMR. BAKER: As an example? Exactly. A\nthird-party beneficiary can enforce an agreement as a\nmatter -- is entitled to enforce -- to use section 3.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If he can do it under State\nlaw?\nMR. BAKER: If he can do it under State law.\nAbsolutely, Justice Scalia.\nThe question of whether or not we satisfied\nthe requirements of equitable estoppel is not before the\nCourt. That's a question to be decided on remand by the\nSixth Circuit.\nUnless there are any further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. De Marco.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. De MARCO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. De MARCO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEstoppel is what you invoke when you have no\ncontract to invoke, and this version of equitable\nestoppel is what you invoke when you have no arbitration\nagreement to invoke.\nI want to come to a question that was just\nasked by Justice Breyer. Section 3 mandates only stays\nin aid of contract-based arbitration obligations. They\nare not fungible, these arbitration agreements. They\ncannot just be picked up by anyone and advanced as a\nground for arbitration.\nThis court has consistently said, in Volt,\nfor example, at page 478: The FAA does not require\nparties to arbitrate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought the first\nissue -- I never got past the first issue.\nMR. De MARCO: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the first issue was,\ndoes he have a right to appeal? And I read the statute,\nand to me section 16 says yes. He asked for a stay. It\nwas denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an\norder refusing a stay. So there's an order refusing a\nstay; he appealed. Why can't he appeal?\nMR. De MARCO: Because the stay that he\nrequested was distinctly outside section 3, not as a\nmerits question, but so far outside question -- section\n3 that we can say he should not -- that the stay was not\nrequested under section 3; it was not denied under\nsection --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any -- is there\nany other example in the law -- I can't think of one --\nwhere you say this party has so silly an argument, which\nis really what you're saying --\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that we don't even let\nhim appeal.\nMR. De MARCO: Yes. There are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems to me I've gotten\na lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too\nmeritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you\ncan't appeal.\nMR. De MARCO: Right. There are sort of\nwhat I would call the Trojan Horse appeals, where a\nparty actually has moved to compel discovery and they\ncharacterized it as an injunction. When that was\ndenied, they said: An injunction was denied; we have\nthe right under 1292(a). The court of appeals is\nperfectly able to pierce that and say: No, that's a\ndiscovery motion; that's outside of the injunctive area.\nAnd here why we're saying this, Your Honor,\nwe recognize what they say about the Behrens case. This\nis an instance where we're asking the Court to, in a\nsense, pull the veil on these section 3 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As to that, if you did\nthat, I got your first point. I understand it. I agree\nwith it.\nAs to the second point, you say -- I was\nsurprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that\nwe are now supposed to reach what we would call the\nmerits of the appeal. Now, there you just heard your\nco-counsel say: Look, you don't have to decide whether\nmy equitable theory is good or not. You haven't read\nthe treatises, I have; which is a fair comment. And --\nand all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a\nthird party could enforce a contract to arbitration that\ntwo others make.\nThe statute doesn't say he can't. The\nstatute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it.\nAnd if you think of a third party beneficiary or an\nassignment, for example, you would think, of course,\nthere are other people, say an assignee, who could\nenforce it.\nMR. De MARCO: Right. And there's a reason\nwhy those -- in those cases, the third -- I will call\nthem nonparties were allowed to enforce. Let me preface\nthat by saying not all of those were -- we've heard a\nlot about State law and Federal law. Not all of those\nare tightly grounded in Federal law.\nBut take your example of the third party\nbeneficiary, they cite a case called J.P. Morgan in\nwhich the woman was incompetent, the agreement with the\nnursing home was signed as -- on her behalf. I think\nthat's clear in that kind of case that the nonparty is\nasserting the right through the contract, because of the\ncontract, dependent on the contract.\nHere, by claiming equitable estoppel not\nonly aren't the Petitioners asserting rights that flow\nto them from the contract, because they have no\ncontract; they are actually saying -- this is the gist,\nit gets back to your question, what's the gist of their\nequitable estoppel theory. It's as we quote in footnote\n13: The gist of it is that equitable principles prevent\nRespondents from claiming that they have no obligation\nto arbitrate with the Petitioners despite the lack of an\nagreement.\nTheir very theory assumes that what section\n3 says must exist is absent. Their very theory says we\ndon't have an agreement of our own to assert, and\ntherefore, we need equitable principles to fill the\nvoid. Now, where do these equitable principles come\nfrom?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you might say that\nthey haven't stated a claim on which relief can be\ngranted, but that is the merits question. We are\nsupposed to be dealing with the question of whether the\ndenial of the stay -- there was a denial of a stay -- is\nappealable under section 16. And to decide that\nquestion I don't think you get into how meritorious\ntheir claim was for the stay.\nMR. De MARCO: Your Honor, the fact that\nthey have filed a motion, and as I referred to it, the\nconcern that we have, and I think the concern that\nanimated DSMC and Universal when they took up this\nissue, was the Trojan Horse stay motion. We have to\nkeep in mind not every stay that is filed pending\narbitration, a stay pending arbitration is necessarily\nfiled under section 3, because in footnote 23 of Moses\nH. Cone this Court recognized another kind of stay\npending arbitration, and that's a discretionary stay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And what is the\ncriterion for identifying a section 3 stay?\nMR. De MARCO: The criterion, Your Honor, is\nthat the right to the stay must be -- the right to --\nthe statute speaks in terms of referable to arbitration\nunder an agreement. What does that mean? \"Referable to\narbitration\" is the arbitration obligation. \"Under\" in\nthat means dependent on, because of. So the\narbitrability of it depends on a written agreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And your -- and your\nposition is that the statute should be so construed that\nonly a signatory to the written agreement has a right to\nthe stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under\narticle 3?\nMR. De MARCO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is your reason for\nsaying that?\nMR. De MARCO: Just to clarify, the statute\nbeing section 3.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. De MARCO: Yes. The reason for that is\nthis Court has been very clear in its interpretations of\nthe FAA in general. The FAA in general, the Court has\nsaid, requires -- does not require parties to arbitrate\nwhen they have not agreed to do so. So that sets the\nstandard. If there is no agreement, you cannot force\nthat signatory, which didn't have an agreement with that\nnonsignatory, to arbitrate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what do you do with\nthird party beneficiary assignment assumption?\nMR. De MARCO: All of those examples,\nJustice Kennedy, in all of those examples the right to\nenforce the agreement, let's say the right to procure a\nstay based on the agreement, flows from the intention of\nthe parties to the original agreement.\nThe examples they use -- assignment, they\ncite a case where there is -- there was an express\nassignment, and in the assignment the Court said they\nactually assigned the agreement with the arbitration\nclause in it to the successor. They cite an assumption\ncase. It was an express signed assumption. Those are\nall cases of contract-based arbitration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a way that was\nwhere one of the parties, without the other party's\nconsent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary. Here\nin a way it's a fortiori because the party who is\nobjecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement\nto come into play. That's their theory.\nMR. De MARCO: Well, let me tease that out a\nbit. The -- one of the -- the problems in this area,\nthis equitable estoppel that has developed as an ersatz\nform of equity principle, it is not tied to section 3\nnor is it tied to State law. It is -- it is perfectly\nad hoc, so it's an amorphous concept that we've seen\ndevelop over the last --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your proper -- I see this\nis actually a pretty difficult question to me, and --\nbecause it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to\nenforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now what I don't know,\nis what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all\nthe other sections, they talk about the agreement, but\nthey don't say that the individual who is asking for the\nstay has to be the same person who signed it, as they\ncouldn't. So how do we know which among all the\npossible people in the case who hasn't signed it should\nand should not be able to enforce it?\nTheir argument is look to State law, okay?\nAnd your argument is derive some principles yourself.\nReally.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, so -- is it\npossible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in\nthinking you always look to State law. It may depend on\nwhat the State law says. So that's the answer to the\nquestion. You should have had your appeal. Go appeal,\nand let the courts below work that out first, knowing\nthat the State law is relevant but not always\ndeterminative. Then we'll get some -- we'll get some\ncase law on this and we'll be in a better position to\nfigure out what the right answer is.\nMR. De MARCO: Justice Breyer, the question\nof arbitrability does not always depend on State law.\nIn Volt, in first options this Court said sometimes it\ndoes, but it does when the issue is, was a contract\nformed, is a contract valid. How are we going to\ninterpret that contract?\nHere where equitable estoppel is concerned,\nthat's not the consideration. Therefore, because you\ncan -- you can interpret the contract until the cows\ncome home, you're never going to find the Petitioners in\nit. So that the question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see it's a little\nhard. I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the\nroom drawing up the contract, they put it in the\narbitration agreement. There are four other people\ndirectly related to the room. The parties look around\nand say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody\nunderstands everybody is going to have to do this. And\nthey all say, okay, don't worry about it.\nNow, I would say, hey, maybe they're\nestopped. And there they're going right through the\ncontract.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I hate to write the\nwords \"equitable estoppel is never relevant.\" I would\nrather write the words \"I'm uncertain State law is\nrelevant policy.\" You know, it's not true that it's\nalways relevant.\nMR. De MARCO: I think the safest ground is\nto clear up first this question of how arbitrability is\ndecided. And I think Justice Alito asked the question:\nIs -- is there unanimity among the courts of appeals.\nThe Fourth Circuit case that I -- I think\nwas mentioned, I believe that's the Bailey case. I\ndon't even think there is unanimity, unfortunately,\nwithin the Fifth Circuit. But there -- the -- the\nbetter view, I think, that is expressed in the Fourth\nCircuit case is that when the issue that's pivotal is\ncontract interpretation, arbitrability in that narrow\nsense, that's State law. When it's not, it's Federal\nlaw.\nAnd I think that's why you see these\nequitable estoppel cases not talking at all about State\nlaw. It is sort of an ersatz, ad hoc version of Federal\nequity that's being --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Why shouldn't the\nFederal law be even simpler than that? And I -- I\nproposed one, and -- and probably because I don't\nunderstand the law well enough, it may -- may have been\nsimply simplistic.\nBut my suggestion was the -- the issue\nbefore us should be construed narrowly as being the\nquestion of who can ask for a stay. And the answer to\nthat would be only a person -- or one possible answer to\nthat would be only a person who has signed the\narbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to\nenforce agreements, not force arbitration. And,\ntherefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy\nto say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track\nfor arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be\nstopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and\nit's that agreement that you're trying to enforce.\nNow, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic\napproach, but tell me what's good or bad about that.\nMR. De MARCO: I think that it's the correct\napproach to say that we are not talking generically\nabout the enforceability of arbitration agreements. We\nare talking in the context under section 3 of an\nexisting lawsuit. That one party says, hey, I want to\nstay this lawsuit. So it is a different enforcement\nmechanism than -- than the -- than the generic law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That opens the door\nto my simplistic theory. Now --\nMR. De MARCO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- is it a good theory or a\nbad theory?\nMR. De MARCO: It's a good theory because\nthen, once you've opened that door to the -- the ability\nto ask for a stay, you must ask: Well, what are the\nground rules for asking for this stay?\nAnd while my friend continuously returns to\nState law, our point is you don't depart from the terms\nof section 3 itself, because section 3 itself tells you\nthe circumstances under which the mandatory stay\nprovision applies. And those circumstances are only\nwhen it is referable to arbitration under a written\nagreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it seems to me\nthat that's not enough, because \"under the written\nagreement\" leaves open the question of whether the\nwritten agreement can be enforced right here and now by\ngetting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a\nthird party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on\nthe contract plus some other legal theory.\nMy simplistic suggestion was: Keep it\nsimple and simply say the -- \"under the agreement\" means\nan agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it\nto an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase\n\"under this agreement\" tells us that. It doesn't. That\nleaves the question open.\nWe say it is going to be confined to an\nagreement signed by you because that's really the -- the\nnub of the Federal policy. We want to enforce\nagreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary\nremedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to\nmake -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or\nnot. And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in\nyour interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be\ngetting into trouble by that. And that's what I want\nyou to tell me.\nMR. De MARCO: Well, that's consistent with\nthe Federal policy as this Court has expressed that\nFederal policy. It has -- it has said repeatedly the\nFederal policy is not a general policy to encourage this\nform of dispute resolution but, rather, it is to give\neffect to parties when and if they agree to arbitration.\nSo I agree that that is, and should be, the starting\npoint of the analysis. Is -- and -- and it was\nexpressed in -- in Mitsubishi this way: That -- that\nthe intent of the FAA is to give effect to arbitration\nagreements, to put them on an equal footing with all\nother agreements, but not more so. And I believe what\n-- what Petitioners are asking for is a \"more so.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. De Marco, can I ask\nyou this question? In section 3 do you agree with his\nreading of the word \"parties,\" or do you think \"parties\"\njust means parties to the contract?\nMR. De MARCO: With my friend's reading?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. De MARCO: Justice Stevens, I have to be\nhonest and say I'm concerned about that argument because\nI think Congress has used the word \"parties\" throughout\nthe FAA rather haphazardly to mean three different\nthings, maybe four: Party to the agreement, party to\nthe action, party to the arbitration, or party-like\nperson. And I would be concerned about hanging it on --\non that. So my -- my answer is, because of the way it's\nused in sections 3, 4, 5, 9, I would be concerned about\n-- about resting on that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You are concerned about --\ndoes that mean you agree with him that \"parties\" means\nparties to the action and not parties to the contract?\nMR. De MARCO: I -- actually in section 3\nwhat I would say is it's equivocal, and the rest of the\nFAA doesn't help us understand that. So it's an -- it's\nan issue on which I would not hang my hat, because it is\nequivocal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What would you think about\nsaying that some parties -- some parties to the case who\nare not parties to the contract can as third parties,\nnonetheless, enforce arbitration? We have listed a few\nexamples, assignees, et cetera. When considering\nwhether this is one of them, judge, the key question --\nwe can tell you what the key question is and what it\nisn't. What it is has to do with the intent of the\npersons who did sign the contract.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Something related to that.\nWe don't have to be specific.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it isn't is a case\nmanagement device. Because what I think the temptation\nwould be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them\nall off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not\nhave to worry about this case for a while. And come\nback, and I'll figure it out.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is that -- is that\nright, or is it wrong? What's your insight or guess on\nthat?\nMR. De MARCO: I think it's -- it's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just looking for ways\nof separating these sheep from goats.\nMR. De MARCO: Yes. The only way, I think,\nto give effect to what the Court said, which is nobody\nis going to be forced to arbitrate when they haven't\nagreed to arbitrate, is for judges to take section 3\nseriously when it is proffered as the basis for a stay\nmotion and to -- and to apply it as --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you just told us\nthat section 3 was ambiguous. You don't know if the\nreference to \"parties\" means parties to the arbitration\nagreement or parties in the litigation. So how can we\ntake it -- we take it seriously, yes, and say there's an\nambiguity. We don't know from the text which is the\nproper reference, parties to the agreement or parties to\nthe litigation.\nMR. De MARCO: Justice Ginsburg, by\ndeclining Justice Stevens's invitation of sorts to read\n\"parties\" a particular way, I did not mean to -- to\nsuggest that the referable -- issue referable to\narbitration under a written agreement is ambiguous. I\ndon't think that's ambiguous.\nI think as applied here in this case it's\nclear that the -- the Petitioners' claim of\narbitrability does not flow, to use Justice Breyer's\nterms, from that which the parties to the Bricolage\nagreement intended. They don't claim that the parties\nto that agreement intended for them to be covered, as\nwould be the case with a third-party beneficiary or --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the \"parties\" in -- in\nsection 3 means parties to the arbitration agreement,\nwould that mean that a -- someone who is not a party to\nthe litigation could file a stay motion under section 3,\nsomeone who is not a party to the litigation but is a\nparty to the arbitration agreement?\nMR. De MARCO: If it were limited to parties\nto the -- if it were interpreted as parties to the\narbitration agreement, then it would suggest that a\nparty outside the litigation -- let's say a party that's\nconducting an arbitration pursuant to an arbitration\nagreement could intervene.\nThat's what happened in DSMC. The -- the --\none of the contracting parties intervened and said, we\nare engaged in this arbitration. We want you to stop\nthis, what had been claimed to be, nonarbitrable\nlitigation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, once they intervene,\nthey are a party to the litigation as well.\nMR. De MARCO: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Once they intervene they\nare.\nMR. De MARCO: There I think it was for the\nlimited purpose of seeking a stay. I -- I take your\npoint, though, that -- I -- I think we have to be\ncareful in -- in judging the -- a stay motion, to focus\non the language of section 3 under the under-written\nagreement language, and when -- when that is the focus,\nI think it's clear that theories such as equitable\nestoppel, an outlier among all those theories that were\nlisted, assumption, assignment -- an outlier among\nthem -- uniquely says that despite the lack of a written\nagreement to arbitrate, equity requires; equity says it\nshould be arbitrated. That -- that I think is\nincompatible with the language of section 3.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would recognize\nthat there is some appeal possibility, because you\nalready said or at least you said in your brief that the\n12 might -- let's get this question settled about the\nequitable estoppel and going to arbitration; That the\ndistrict court in its discretion that could give a\n1292(b) order and say I want to get this issue settled\non appeal before I go on with the case.\nMR. De MARCO: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be all right.\nMR. De MARCO: There is an appellate pathway\nand that is 1292(b). That has always existed for\ndiscretionary stays. I think it applies when a party\nattempts, perhaps labels its motion a section 3 stay,\nbut misses the mark by not truly grounding it in\nsection 3. When it misses the mark, their outlet --\ntheir pathway to interlocutory appeal ought to be\n1292(b), particularly because section 16(b) indicates\nCongress felt that was a compatible accommodation in the\nstay -- in the arbitration context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- the district\njudge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b)\nissue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court\nof appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is?\nMR. De MARCO: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. I want to be clear that the rule we propose\nas to these claimants asserting equitable estoppel does\nnot preclude them from seeking a stay, even based on\nequitable estoppel. And the best example I can give you\nis one in the D.C. Circuit, in the post-DSMC era.\nThere's a case called Toledano in which the party was\nasserting exactly the same theory that -- that\nPetitioners are, equitable estoppel entitles us to a\nstay. And what the court said there is well, DSMC has\ncome down and said you cannot under section 3 predicate\na stay on equitable estoppel, because you are by\ndefinition saying I am not subject to a written\nagreement; that's the predicate for section 3.\nSo what the District Court said in that\nState -- in that case, it entertained the stay as a\ndiscretionary stay, and it granted it. It granted it on\nthe very same ground that my friend is insisting should\nbe the ground for a mandatory stay in the post-DSMC era;\nit's a basis in the District of Columbia for a\ndiscretionary stay. It worked exactly the same way.\nThe difference was you -- you were true to\nthe language of section 3 and you were true to the\nlanguage of section 16(a)(1)(A); you don't have the\nrunaway stays in the D.C. Circuit that you have in the\nFifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit and to some\nextent in the Fourth Circuit; and you don't have the\ninterlocutory appeals from those except under 1292.\nI want to come back to a -- to a question\nthat was -- that was asked by Justice Ginsburg about\nBricolage. If Bricolage were, let's say, back in the\npicture, or does the fact that Bricolage is out of the\npicture make a difference?\nThe only sense in which an issue in this\ncase was ever referable to arbitration under an\nagreement in writing is under the Bricolage agreement.\nOnce Bricolage departed the case, that obligation that\nRespondents may have had to arbitrate with Bricolage\nbecame inoperative, and what I see Petitioners\nattempting to do is to disaggregate that the obligation\nthat Respondents undertook to arbitrate with Bricolage\nfrom Bricolage's reciprocal obligation, detach it, and\nrun away with it as if it's a fungible commodity and say\nwe are now owed this obligation, when -- contrary to\neverything this Court has ever said.\nThat's not the way the FAA works, because\nwith the FAA the starting point as this Court said in\nMitsubishi is did the parties agree to arbitrate that\ndispute? And if we're talking about the -- the absence\nof Bricolage, I think we're -- we're dealing with a case\nwhere even among the equitable estoppel cases, this case\nwill turn out to be an outlier because of Bricolage's\nabsence.\nI say that because we're also dealing with\naccountants who were their accountants for 25 years\nbefore Bricolage came along. We're dealing with a law\nfirm that had a written retention agreement, had a\ncontract with them and didn't think to put it in that\ncontract, saying, \"oh, pay no attention to that, let me\nshow you this contract that they signed with someone\nelse.\"\nIt gets back to Justice Breyer's point: If\nI -- let's say I unilaterally published in The\nWashington Post, \"I am through with litigation,\nhenceforth I will arbitrate every dispute with every\nother human being that I get involved in.\" That's not a\nsection 3 agreement to arbitrate.\nAgreement imports the notion of an exchange\nof arbitration obligations, which we do not have here.\nBricolage is gone. There's no question that the premise\nof this equitable estoppel argument is the absence of a\n-- of an agreement to arbitrate should be overlooked\nbecause of equity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Bricolage did move to\ncompel, it did move for a stay, did make a section 3\napplication; and then it -- it became bankrupt and got\nthe benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy.\nMR. De MARCO: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I take it that\nAndersen and Curtis are saying we have a right to be\nsubstituted for Bricolage. That's --\nMR. De MARCO: That's what their -- that's\napparently their argument, and the problem is how do\nthey fill that gap. They attempt to fill it with State\nlaw. I think State law does not apply, the language of\nsection 3 applies, Your Honor, and section 3 cannot get\nthem there from here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. De Marco.\nMr. Baker, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe question of appellate jurisdiction, the\nPetitioners here made a motion for relief under section\n3, and that motion was denied. Therefore there is\njurisdiction under section 16 to reach the question of\nwhether we were entitled to relief under section 3.\nRespondents have made a very important\nconcession that decides this case. Respondents concede\nthat under section 3 nonparties can enforce an\narbitration agreement through the mechanism of section\n3. That decides this case. This case should be\nremanded to the Court of Appeals to decide the question\nof whether on these facts, these nonparty Petitioners\ncan actually enforce section 3.\nThe Petitioners' quarrel is with the\ndoctrine of equitable estoppel. They don't like it, but\nthere's nothing in the text of section 3 that allows\nthis Court or any court to distinguish between the\nvarious doctrines or legal theories that nonparties may\nseek to which -- to enforce section 3. We happen to\nhave used section 3, happen to have invoked equitable\nestoppel as the basis for invoking section 3, but it\ncould have been assigned and it could have been a third\nparty beneficiary.\nThey have -- Respondents have conceded the\nprinciple that section 3 is available to provide relief\non nonparties who are otherwise entitled to enforce the\nagreement. They just think that on the merits we don't\nsatisfy the requirements of equitable estoppel. That's\na question to be decided on remand. Equitable estoppel,\nI will say very briefly, presupposes the existence of a\nwritten arbitration agreement. In the absence of a\nwritten arbitration agreement, Petitioners here would\nnot have any ability to assert this theory of equitable\nestoppel. So -- so it's not completely separated from\nor detached from the existence of a written arbitration\nagreement.\nI would like to turn to Justice Souter's\nsignatory test for allowing relief under section 3.\nWith all respect, this defies 80 years of case law\ninterpreting the Federal Arbitration Act. It defies the\nhistory of the Federal Arbitration Act. It's settled\nthat Congress in enacting this Act, chose New York law,\nand the New York arbitration act lad a much more\nstringent requirement for arbitrating existing disputes\nwhich required a signature.\nCongress, as we outlined in our brief, did\nnot choose that section of the New York law as a model\nwhen it enacted the FAA in 1925. 1292(b), the right to\nappellate jurisdiction is illusory because that is\ndenied; a nonparty with arbitration rights be forced to\nlitigate and lose the very things that arbitration is\ndesigned to avoid -- that is, the cost and time of being\nin litigation in a district court. Not only that, the\nDistrict Court will suffer the loss of judicial\nefficiency by having to litigate -- litigate a case\nbefore it or adjudicate a case that should be in\narbitration.\nUnless there are any further questions, I\nwill conclude the argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
