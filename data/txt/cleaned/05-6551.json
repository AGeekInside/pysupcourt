        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first\nin 05-6551, Cunningham versus California. Mr. Gold.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe procedure for imposing aggravated sentences\nunder California's Determinate Sentencing Law implicates\nthe bright line rule this Court set forth in Blakely and\nApprendi. Any fact other than the fact of a prior\nconviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe primary point of contention in this case is\nwhat constitutes the statutory maximum under California's\nDeterminate Sentencing Law. Petitioner believes that\nit's the middle term, whereas respondent maintains that\nit's the upper term.\nIn fact, this case really boils down to just one\nquestion. Can a judge in California legally impose an\nupper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected\nin the jury's verdict or the defendant's admissions. The\nanswer to this question is no. California's Determinate\nSentencing Law specifies three possible prison terms for\neach -- for each felony conviction, a lower term, a\nmiddle term, and an upper term, although it mandates that\njudges shall impose the middle term unless there are\nfactors of aggravation or mitigation. California case\nlaw confirms that judges must impose the middle term\nwhere there are no aggravating factors, and even the\nstate appears to concede the point.\nBecause the middle term is the greatest\npunishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts\nreflected in the jury's verdict, it, and not the upper\nterm, constitutes the statutory maximum for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gold, I know you take that\nposition on the facts of this case, but is it not true\nthat there could be cases in which the verdict of the\njury would establish certain facts that would justify\ngoing beyond the middle term? For example, the Black\ncase itself, as the justice who dissented in this case\nthought the sentence was permissible in that case.\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, Justice Stevens, to the\nextent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used\nas an aggravating factor, but is not an element of the\ncrime or found by the jury as an enhancement, that could\nbe used to impose an upper term sentence. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would it always, then, be\nsurplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and\nsubsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus\nfact? Because otherwise -- I mean, what I'm getting at\nis, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating\nan element of the offense, and as I understand it, under\nCalifornia law, the element of the offense couldn't\nsatisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the\nhigher range.\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, typically\nunder California law, in the information, they allege the\ncrime, and on occasion, some of the elements. But\ntypically not all of the elements.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If in this case, the indictment\nhad charged -- had claimed that the defendant was the\nfather of the victim, would that have satisfied at least\nthe fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a\nposition of trust?\nMR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, the fact that the\ninformation would have alleged that does not mean that\nthe jury would have found that fact, because just because\n-- what is alleged in the indictment or in the\ninformation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That depends on the instructions.\nMR. GOLD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the instructions said, you\nknow, you've got to find all of the things that are set\nout in the information, and the jury returned a verdict,\nthen we would have found -- and that would satisfy the\nrequirement of an additional fact on an element.\nMR. GOLD: I believe so, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be an erroneous\ninstruction, I assume.\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You either have to have an\nerroneous instruction or a special verdict.\nMR. GOLD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Only in the sense that it would\nrequire the state to prove more than it had to prove for\nthe elements of the crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Souter, and I agree that\nit would be no different than submitting aggravating\nfactors as a separate allegation to the jury as a\nseparate instruction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the thing that\nconcerns me about your case is that California's system\nlooks a lot like the Federal system after Booker. We\nhaven't addressed the issue or had a case involving\nreview of reasonableness for upward departure. But at\nleast as the circuits have said it, in a federal case,\nthe district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any\nreason for departing from what the guidelines might\nsuggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I\nthink in most circuits, that would be reversed.\nSame here. If a California judge imposes the\nupper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to\nbe reversed. But if a federal judge gives a statement of\nhis reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an\noffender likely to offend again, whatever, under most\ncircuit law, that's going to be upheld.\nHere, if the California judge does that, that's\ngoing to be still struck down under your view. You\ntalked about Blakely and Apprendi. But how does this\nsystem look to you under Booker?\nMR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, this system really is\n-- this is just like -- this case is just like Blakely.\nWhat the California Supreme Court in People against Black\nfound, they used references to reasonableness as a label\nand a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of\nBlakely and Apprendi.\nInstead they tried to fit the Determinate\nSentencing Law within the Federal system this Court found\nconstitutional in Booker. But the California Supreme\nCourt seriously misread Booker. In Booker, in the\nremedial portion of that decision, this Court found the\nFederal system to be constitutional by rendering the\nguidelines -- the mandatory guidelines to be advisory.\nNow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under California, they're\nadvisory anyway. I mean, even if the judge makes the\nnecessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he\ndoesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose\nthe lower one.\nMR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, no. He has to\nimpose the middle term. He can't deviate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is if he makes a\nfinding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16\nyears in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher\nterm, he can go back to the middle term.\nMR. GOLD: No, no, you are absolutely right. He\nhas discretion not to do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But does it say that the only\nbasis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is\nthat the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't\nfind.\nMR. GOLD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does say that? As I read the\nCalifornia opinion, they can go up above the lower, the\nmiddle term for any reason, but it has to be reasonable.\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, what this -- what the\nCalifornia Supreme Court did, in this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe that's hard to justify in\nterms of California's statute, but we take the California\nSupreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law\nof California. So what is the answer to my question as\nyou read Black?\nMR. GOLD: The answer to your question is that\nBlack has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory\nnature of California's Determinate Sentencing Law, and it\nhas always operated in a mandatory way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think -- let me give\nyou --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think your answer would be that\nhow could it possibly be reasonable except for the\nconsideration of some additional fact? What makes it\nreasonable other than facts? Atmosphere? I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that is your answer, my\nexample will be -- I'll give you a specific example.\nOne example is the question of consecutive versus\nconcurrent sentences, which may have very little to do\nwith facts.\nA second example might be that a judge in a\nparticular community says there's been an unbelievable\nrash of breaking and entering. I see how the writers of\nthis guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought\nthat breaking and entering was X, occurred with X\nfrequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of\ncrime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to\nincrease the sentence as a deterrent.\nNow, suppose that's what he writes. And is there\nanything in California law, as you understand Black, that\nmakes that unlawful?\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. GOLD: I believe that the statements in Black\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which statements make that\nunlawful?\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, in Black, the California\nSupreme Court repeatedly stated that the way the system\nworks in California is that it is a mandatory system. So\nas an example, at 35 Cal.4th 1254, the court stated, \"the\ncourt cannot impose the upper term unless there is at\nleast one aggravating factor.\" At 1260, the court said,\n\"in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found,\nthe judge cannot impose the upper term.\"\nThere are a number of statements throughout the\nBlack opinion that indicate the system has never changed\nfrom a mandatory one to an advisory one, so that\nreasonableness is not the issue. Whether the system is\nmandatory or advisory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, when they say\nmandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean\nto exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just\nmentioned.\nMR. GOLD: Well, a judge can consider those\naggravating factors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, could he? Could the judge\nconsider the fact that I just mentioned, that there's\nbeen an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in\nthe vicinity?\nMR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?\nMR. GOLD: Well, under California's law, they have\n-- in addition to factors relating to the crime and\nfactors relating to the defendant, the judge can consider\nunenumerated factors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Unenumerated factors. So mine\nwould be an unenumerated factor.\nMR. GOLD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If he can consider\nunenumerated factors -- now, I purposely picked mine\nbecause I take it it is an example of a factor that\nApprendi would not require a jury to find.\nIt is a factor about the community. It is not a\nfactor about this defendant. It is not a factor about\nthe manner in which this defendant committed the crime.\nIt is not a fact of that kind.\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, I'm not sure whether that\nsort of factor would be upheld as a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if it were reasonable, it\nwould be upheld, or not?\nMR. GOLD: If it was found to be a decision that\nwas reasonably related to the crime -- I'm sorry, to the\ndecision being made by the judge, then yes, it would be\nupheld as a valid aggravating factor. But I believe that\nit would still need to be then, if it would be considered\na valid aggravating factor, then it would need to be\ntried by the jury.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I clarify one thing? You\nmean that a rash of crimes committed by people other than\nthe defendant could be an aggravating factor?\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, under California law, I'm\nnot saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason.\nI'm just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there's nothing in\nCalifornia law suggesting that that would be upheld, is\nthere?\nMR. GOLD: No, Justice Stevens, there is not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you draw -- as I understand\nit, your basic answer to Justice Breyer is, it may well\nbe that the situation in the community may justify a\njudge in going to the -- to the high end of the range\nthat is possible, but that is not a factor that\ndetermines what range is possible. And the fact that\ndetermines what range is possible is an aggravating fact,\nand in that respect, it is different from the Federal\nsystem. Is that --\nMR. GOLD: That's absolutely right, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand it. If he\ndoes -- tell me again, would you? I thought your\nresponse was going to be what Justice -- who suggested\nit?\n(Laughter).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody on that side suggested\nit. That to talk about the fact that there's a lot of\ncrime in the community as an aggravating factor doesn't\nmake any sense. Aggravating factor means something that\nmakes the crime that this person committed worse, not the\nneed for punishment greater, but makes the crime worse.\nNow, if that is not your answer, what is the answer that\nyou gathered, from the left of me?\nMR. GOLD: Well, with all due respect to Justice\nBreyer, I believe that that probably would not be an\naggravating factor that would be upheld under California\nlaw. I was just trying to make the distinction between\nwhether an aggravating factor, no matter what it is,\nwhether it is considered reasonable, whether that's\nenough to get the judge to go beyond the statutory\nmaximum. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought your position was that\naggravation must be reasonable. What the court in Black\nindicates is that it is not going to consider anything\nreasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless\nthere's a finding of fact to support it. Is that the\nposition you take?\nMR. GOLD: The position as far as what Black is\nsaying?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. GOLD: Yes. I think Black -- what Black is\nsaying is that an aggravating factor needs to be\nreasonable, but I was trying to make the distinction --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think that there's the\nfurther indication that it is not going to be deemed\nreasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact,\nas indicated in order to support one of the specific\nguideline aggravators.\nMR. GOLD: Certainly if the aggravating factor is\nnot supported by the evidence, then it won't be\nconsidered reasonable and the imposition of a upper term\nwon't be considered reasonable. But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand the\ndistinction between the California system and a system of\nadvisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review.\nLet's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range\nafter convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred\nyears. And let's say you have two judges who have these\ncases. And one sentences the defendant to zero,\nprobation. The other one sentences the defendant to a\nhundred years.\nWithout saying a word of explanation for either\nsentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation\ngoing to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen\nzero or why you have chosen 100? And if the trial judge\nprovides an explanation, isn't the trial judge\nnecessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the\njudge believes to be true about the offense and the\noffender?\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, if you're describing the\nFederal system or just a hypothetical system, my\nunderstanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge\ncan impose whatever sentence he wants. And whether or\nnot in a particular system, that will be reviewed for\nreasonableness is a separate question as to what he --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it reviewed for\nreasonableness -- isn't the reasonableness review\nnecessarily going to require what is, in essence,\nfact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the\nreasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by\nan appellate court?\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. But what -- in\nBooker, what made the Federal system constitutional was\nnot the engraftment of the reasonableness review. It was\nrendering the mandatory guidelines advisory. And that's\nthe aspect of California's Supreme Court Black decision\nthat they've misread the Booker decision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that, why is that so?\nWhy isn't the middle sentence, just like what the\nguideline -- what the guideline would indicate? And if a\nFederal court would say, if I sentence within the\nguideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many\ncourts have held. Not this Court yet. That would be\npresumptively valid.\nAnd if I go outside, I have to give a reason that\nwill survive appellate review. Well, why isn't the\nmiddle sentence identical in function to the Federal\nsentencing guidelines advice?\nMR. GOLD: Justice Ginsburg, I think that it's the\nmandatory nature in California of the middle term. The\njudge cannot exceed the middle term unless he finds at\nleast one aggravating factor. And my understanding in\nthe Federal system is that the judge can exceed the --\ncan exceed these guideline ranges and that they're just\nadvisory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To say that a sentence within the\nguideline range is reasonable is not to say that a\nsentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable. So\nunder the Federal system, it is perfectly possible --\nunless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a\nsentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to\nbe affirmed, because although the guideline range is\nreasonable, there are other systems that would be\nreasonable, right?\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Your -- Justice Scalia. And I\nthink that to the extent that we are going to say that\nany sentence outside this guideline range is going to be\nunreasonable and necessarily require reversal is going to\nbe no different than the mandatory guideline system this\nCourt struck down in Booker itself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only part of the\nCalifornia system that creates a problem is this -- the\none sentence in the statute that says the judge shall\nimpose the middle term unless he makes a finding.\nMR. GOLD: That's absolutely right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if we rule in your\nfavor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in\nCalifornia will be that judges can now depart without\nmaking a particular finding, they can increase the\nsentence even though they do not find an aggravator\nwithin the limits of the California system.\nMR. GOLD: But Mr. Chief Justice, it is not clear\nthat that would be the result in California. The\nlegislature could very well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't the decision in\nBlack suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the\nresult? The California Supreme Court?\nMR. GOLD: I'm not sure that they think that that\nwould be the result. They certainly did not make an\nattempt to reform or rewrite the statute so that it was\nnow an advisory system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that -- it\nlooked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black.\nI mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion,\nthe day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and\nthe California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a\nlot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly\nvalid.\nIn other words, saying that judges can depart\nwithin this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart\nwithin this whole range, and we're going to review their\ndeterminations for reasonableness. They don't have to\nimpose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher\nsentence, and we will review it for reasonableness. That\nwould be perfectly all right.\nMR. GOLD: Well, and that may very well be the\ncase, but that's not what the California Supreme Court\ndid in Black. They made no attempt. What they did was\ndescribed the Determinate Sentencing Law as it has always\noperated. And at no time did they purport to change the\nlaw in California, including the mandatory nature of the\nDeterminate Sentencing Law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what they said was\njudges can impose a sentence in either of the three --\nany one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it\nfor reasonableness. And if they don't make findings, it\nis going to be unreasonable, right?\nMR. GOLD: Yes, but once again, the reasonableness\naspect is not what makes the system constitutional. It\nis the mandatory versus advisory aspect. And again,\nthat's what made the Federal system constitutional based\non this Court's Booker decision. It wasn't this\nengraftment of reason -- reviewing these sentences for\nreasonableness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, to be quite -- to expose my\nthinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260\nand 1261. Is that what -- the first part of that is --\nit says what you said. I have no doubt. It says just\nwhat you said.\nBut then you get over to the part, the discussion\nof Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they\nseem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what\nBooker says. Now, if they are adopting what Booker says,\nthat means, and that's why I used my example, that I\nguess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable,\nto just say the guideline, though it says thus and so,\nisn't right for my circumstance. And therefore, I don't\nadopt it. And that would be reviewed for reasonableness,\nhis decision not to follow it.\nAnd similarly, we have cases, for example, where\nthey're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get\nit right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so\nhe adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in\norder -- and then makes them concurrent. Or you could\nhave things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy,\nand the jury found the conspiracy. It is a\ncharacterization of a conspiracy, it is very\nsophisticated.\nAnd I thought, well, maybe all three of those are\nreasons for going up in California. And I read those\npages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is I'm not sure.\nMR. GOLD: Well, Your Honor, I have no doubt that\nthe California Supreme Court was trying to fit the\nDeterminate Sentencing Law within the constitutionality\nof this Court's Booker system. But as far as 1261, I'm\nlooking -- every single time they talk about Booker or\nreasonableness, they also make sure to give the -- to\nmake sure that they make clear that the way the\nsentence -- the system works is that there's still this\nrequirement of finding an aggravating factor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: An aggravating factor means\naggravating fact.\nMR. GOLD: Aggravating fact, uh -- yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you think would be\nnecessary, what would be the least change California\nwould have to make to bring its system into compliance\nwith our decisions?\nMR. GOLD: Justice Ginsburg, the court could --\nthe court or the legislature could change section 1170(b)\nto read something like: \"A judge may impose\" instead of\n\"shall impose\" the middle term. And that would be valid\nto the extent that what they mean by \"may\" is they can\nnow impose the middle term based just on the facts found\nby the jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or they could say the middle term\nwill always be reasonable. Couldn't they say that?\nMR. GOLD: They could, and in effect, they do say\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even though there is the\npossibility that something above the middle term would\nalso be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete\nfact beyond the indictment to justify it. Right?\nMR. GOLD: Yes. There are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The protection that\ncriminal defendants now have, that they cannot be\nsentenced to a higher term unless the judge makes\nparticular findings, will then be no longer applicable.\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Your Honor. I -- and I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's true unless the\nCalifornia legislature does what most states have done in\nresponse to Booker, which is not that route at all. They\ndid maintain their determinate sentencing, but they just\nrequired the jury finding. That's what I think seven out\nof nine states have done.\nMR. GOLD: Yes, Justice Stevens. And that was the\npoint I was going to make, that that is a very likely\noutcome, given what the majority of other states have\ndone. And that, Mr. Chief Justice, would be a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that now the defendant\nwill have the protection of his jury determining his\nguilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his\nguilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to\nre-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm,\nall the bad things that will increase his sentence and\nmight affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the\nfirst place.\nMR. GOLD: Not necessarily, Your Honor. Because\nfor those type of prejudicial factors, California is\nwell-positioned to handle those, because they do so\nanyway in bifurcated proceedings. There are often\nenhancement allegations that relate to recidivism or even\ngang allegations, anything that's prejudicial are handled\nat a separate proceeding after trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And are there a half a\ndozen jury trials in each -- for each of those various\naggravating factors that now have to be tried to the\njury?\nMR. GOLD: No, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say\nis that basically California does that anyway now. Most\nof the factors that relate to the defendant have to do\nwith recidivism. And those are the same kind of factors\nthat are alleged in the information, and are tried in a\nbifurcated proceeding to the jury, or are waived and then\nthe trial court will consider them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's interesting. Are there,\nin fact -- what's your estimate, guess, as to how many\ncriminal jury-tried cases in California, what percent\nhave two juries? Have more than one jury?\nMR. GOLD: They don't have more than one jury.\nThey are tried to the same jury, but they are tried after\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In what percentage would you say\nthey have bifurcated or several jury trials? I mean,\nmore than just one.\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, I would say that there are\nlots of cases where they're tried to a court. The\ndefendant will waive them if they're based on recidivism.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but how many, how many\ntimes do they -- let me call it impaneling the jury\ntwice, or two juries, or it could be the same one.\nMR. GOLD: The same --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What percentage would you\nguess? Just make a rough -- roughest conceivable guess.\nMR. GOLD: Completely anecdotally, I would say 20\npercent. I -- if -- I would like to reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gold.\nMr. Laurence.\nORAL ARGUMENT BY JEFFREY M. LAURENCE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. LAURENCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe central lesson from Booker, from the real\nportion of Booker, is that not every constraint that's\nplaced on a trial court's discretion in selecting a term\nwithin a range that requires fact-finding invokes the\nSixth Amendment requirement of a jury trial.\nA reasonableness constraint that requires the\ncourt to consider all the circumstances of the defendant\nand select a reasonable sentence in relation to those\nfacts and those factors does not invoke the Sixth\nAmendment jury trial right. California has consistently\nconstrued its system as placing nothing more than a\nreasonableness constraint on the trial court's discretion\nin selecting among the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not so at all. California\nsays if you go over the middle range, it is unreasonable,\nperiod, unless you prove or you find one of the\naggravating factors. That's a constraint. You cannot go\nabove the middle range.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, but that's the\nsame constraint that this Court found not above the\nConstitution in Booker.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, that's not what we found in\nBooker. We found in Booker, or at least the way the\nlower Federal courts have been interpreting Booker, if\nyou use the guideline range, and you're within the\nguideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you\ndon't have to worry about it.\nBut we haven't held, and I don't believe most of\nthe Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the\nguideline range, it is automatically unreasonable. And\nthat is the case with the California system, if you go\nbeyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable\nunless you -- unless you find one of the aggravating\nfacts.\nMR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, I'd have to\nrespectfully disagree with that because we're not talking\nabout a middle range. What we are talking about is an\nend point. If I can use the Booker example, where you\nhave a term of 10 years to life, the court can certainly\nmake a selection within a reasonable range. At some\npoint, as the court increases its sentence beyond a\ncertain point, it will become unreasonable.\nWe don't need to identify specifically what that\npoint is, the guideline range or something close to it.\nBut when you get to the end point, if there's no\njustification offered whatsoever for a life term --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the difference is, in the\nFederal system, the judge can go above and it can be\nreasonable based on facts that were found by the jury.\nBut in California, to go beyond the middle range\nup to the upper range, it must be a fact not found by the\njury.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that not correct?\nMR. LAURENCE: That's only correct because\nCalifornia has a discrete three-term sentence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. But whatever the\nreason, it is correct.\nMR. LAURENCE: It is correct, Your Honor, but the\ncentral point of both Booker and California is that that\nupper term is being reversed not because it's\nunauthorized, but because it's unreasonable.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: On one hand, in one case, the\nunreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by\nthe jury. But in the Federal system, it does not require\nthat finding by a jury.\nMR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, if a Federal judge\nwished to impose a life term, there would have to be\nsomething to justify it, or it would be reversed on\nappeal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It wouldn't necessarily be a\nfact. It could be a fact. What it says in here is that\nif the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the\ncrime, or the offender. And in a case in which no such\naggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose\nthe upper term.\nNow, I grant you there's some language that I --\nit seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say\nsomething a little different. But that language, if you\njust take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a\nfact about the situation that would make it reasonable to\ngo above the middle range, you can't, under the law.\nNow, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I\nfind it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely\nand other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is\nwhat the majority says. So that seems to me almost like\nit, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.\nMR. LAURENCE: I would say you are wrong, Your\nHonor, simply because California has construed its\nsentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a\nreasonableness --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if -- as I understand it,\nit has construed it by saying that if you go above the\nmiddle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond\nwhat has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as\na matter of law. And that unreasonableness as a matter\nof law feature is what distinguishes it from the Federal\nsystem post Booker.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I would disagree,\nbecause the upper term, the statutory maximum in Booker\nwould also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no\njustification offered by the trial court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the justification under the\nFederal system could be, you know, this is what the\nsentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence\nfor this crime. I disagree with that. Now, there are\nother authorities who think that that's a little too, you\nknow, below what it ought to be. He can simply disagree\nwith the sentencing guidelines.\nOr he could point out what Justice Breyer\nsuggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for\nsome jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a\nspecial problem with regard to this kind of a crime. He\ncan do that and doesn't have to find any special fact.\nHe cannot do that in California.\nMR. LAURENCE: I have two responses to that, Your\nHonor. First of all, with regard to what the ruling in\nBooker was, the court's discretion has to be exercised in\nrelation to the policy considerations set out in 3553(a),\nwhich are the same policy considerations that the court\nmust look at, very similar in California, that there are\n-- the court doesn't have unbridled discretion, select\nany term based on whim, based on whatever it feels would\nbe -- whatever he decides to do on Tuesday.\nThe court has to do it with regard to the policy\nconsiderations that are inherent in what the guidelines\ndecisions were, and what the legislature established\nshould be appropriate sentencing considerations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not necessarily\nmean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in\norder to do it. We come back to Justice Scalia's hypo a\nmoment ago. He can go, you know, in theory, under\nBooker, he can go above the guideline range consistent\nwith policy positions that may not be precise, without\nnecessarily making discrete findings of fact.\nI mean, you'd have to judge it in each individual\ncase, but the possibility is there. And under the\nCalifornia system, the possibility is not there.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, the systems\nconverge at the end point. And that is, under the\nFederal system, going to that right end point would be\nunreasonable in every circumstance if there's no\njustification offered, other than he committed the\noffense.\nIn California, because we have three discrete\nterms rather than a spectrum, you have the same effect\nwhen you get to the end point. It would be\nunjustified -- it would be an unreasonable sentence if\nthere's no justification offered. But the fact that\nCalifornia has three points rather than a range shouldn't\nbe constitutionally determinative.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they can't be a fact -- in\nCalifornia, it can't be a fact found by the jury, as\nJustice Stevens pointed out. That's a significant\ndifference.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, it can't be an element. And\nthat -- obviously, there could be a circumstance where\nsome special findings were made, in which case that might\nbe beyond the elements. But it can't be an element\nsimply because you shouldn't be double counting what's\nalready established.\nThe range is set by the elements of the offense,\nthat all three terms are available from the jury verdict\nbased on those elements. If you are going to make a\nselection within that range, it would have to be more\nthan simply the defendant committed the offense. And\nthat's the same with the Federal guidelines. Simply\nsaying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't the same in the Federal\nguidelines. Under the Federal guidelines, the judge\ncould say, you know, I think this offense is more serious\nthan what the sentencing commission thought, and these\nare my reasons for it. There was a dissent, you know --\nthe sentencing commission's determinations are\nreasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable\ndisposition.\nAnd it is open to a Federal district judge to say,\nwell, that's what they thought, and I took it into\naccount, and I seriously considered it, and I think they\nare wrong on this, I think this is more serious. And\nthat could be a perfectly reasonable determination. That\ncouldn't be done in California.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, it could, Your Honor. And I\nwould refer you to Rule 4.410 in our appendix, page 2 and\n3, that the general policy considerations that over --\nthat overlay our sentencing guidelines or our sentencing\nsystem, include deterrence for this defendant and\ndeterring others from committing the same crime, that you\ncan just look to the -- what is happening in this\nparticular neighborhood, as the examples brought out.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying to us that under\nthe California system, if a California judge went through\nexactly the thought process that Justice Scalia just\noutlined and put that down on paper, without finding any\ndiscrete fact beyond the elements the jury found, that he\ncould go to the third tier? I really think deterrence\nrequires the third tier, not the middle tier? Can a\nCalifornia judge do that?\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, deterrence is a\nbasis for going to the third tier.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's critical, and that's\nwhat I didn't understand about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not true. You\ncertainly didn't argue that way in your papers up to now.\nI thought that there has to be a finding of some\naggravating factor, not simply, I think deterrence is\nmore than what the statute says, or deterrence requires\nmore than what the statute says. Is that really your\nposition, that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more\nthan the middle range, for that reason alone, he can say\nI ignore the middle range?\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, that's part of the rules of\ncourt under 4.410. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where --\nMR. LAURENCE: That would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's appendix page 3 in the\nbrief.\nMR. LAURENCE: Page 2 and 3.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that that's the way\nthe Black court interpreted it. The Black court talked\nabout a requirement that the upper-term sentence be\nimposed only if an aggravating factor exists.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor, that would be\nconsidered an aggravating factor, to use deterrence for\nthis particular case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do I do here? Because the\nsentence I read to you seems to say the opposite. But\nthen, two sentences on, they list, the Federal judge is\nnot bound by the guidelines, he must consult the\nguidelines. And after they say, an aggravating\nCalifornia -- it says the discretion available -- the --\nin California law, that may include any fact that the\njudge reasonably determines to be relevant. The\nDeterminate Sentencing Law, about an upper term, is\ncomparable to Booker's requirement that a Federal judge's\nsentencing decision not be unreasonable.\nWell, I assumed until this minute that the first\nstatement trumped the second. But now when I see the\ncourt rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given\nthat to be read as permitting them, particularly with the\nsecond statement, you could read the second statement as\nsaying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind\nof sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in\nthis community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment\nthat I'm giving a higher one. To be honest, I don't know\nwhat Black means.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, before you --\ncould you tell me where the court rule you're talking\nabout is set out?\nMR. LAURENCE: It's in our appendix, page -- the\nappendix to our brief, I'm sorry, the appendix to our\nbrief, page 2 and 3.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say in your brief, which\ndoesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying\nhere, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example,\nby applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing\nscheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or\nalternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThere's no indication there that the judge could\njust say, I think more deterrence is necessary and\ntherefore, I'm going to exceed the base range. That's\njust totally incompatible with that.\nMR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, that's to exceed the\nbase range, to go beyond the three terms. If you want to\nimpose an enhancement for gun use, or for an enhancement\nsuch as in Apprendi, not for selecting a term within the\nbase range.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But even for\nselecting a term within the base range, I'm going to read\nnow from Rule 4.20. Part (b) says, \"circumstances in\naggravation and mitigation shall be established by a\npreponderance of the evidence.\"\nThat's not the way we refer to judges' reasoning\nabout policy. That's the way we refer to proof of fact.\nAnd I don't see how under subsection (b) your answer to\nme can be correct.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think the rules\nof court are viewed as a whole with 4.408, which talks\nabout anything in addition to -- that the rules of -- the\nexamples set out are not exclusive and not determinant,\nthat anything can be a consideration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they have to be an\naggravating factor.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And to talk about the need for\nmore deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an\naggravating factor.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the\nexample that was given was in relation to the community\nthat was experiencing some uptick in crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not an aggravating factor.\nIt's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it\ndoesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime\ncommitted by other individuals. It's not an aggravating\nfactor.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, the importance of\nour position, the central thrust of our position is that\nthe reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed\nunder 1170(b) has been interpreted as a reasonableness\nconstraint. It doesn't matter if factors are required --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it can be a reasonableness\nconstraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that\nrequires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness.\nThe two are not exclusive.\nMR. LAURENCE: That's true, Your Honor. That's\ntrue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the rule seems to conflate --\nseems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete\nfact. And it seems to me that we've got to consider the\nrule in responding to the ambiguity that Justice Breyer\nreferred to a moment ago. The ambiguity has got to be\nread in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems\nto answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the\nevidence. That means a fact finding.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, let me explain it this way,\nYour Honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective\nwhether or not there is a factor required in order to say\nthat something is -- that the end point is reasonable, or\nif you are taking deterrence into account, that that's\nnot -- it's not necessary for our argument because our\nposition is that even if a factor is required --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So do you think under subsection\n(b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the\npolicy of deterrence requires something heavier, you\nthink that statement by the judge would satisfy the\nrequirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence?\nMR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor. I don't.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then it seems to me\nthat you cannot hold your position consistently with the\nstate rule of court.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I would refer\nback to Black at 1255, which is the important part.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is Black repealing the rule of\ncourt? I mean, Black -- if we refer back to Black, we\nget the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has raised. In\norder to solve the ambiguity, we look to the court rule.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under the court rule, you admit\nthat a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely\nheld, could not satisfy the requirement to prove\naggravation by a preponderance. Isn't that the end of\nthe issue? I mean, if California wants to amend its\nrules or its statute, that's California's business. But\nwe can't do it.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, no, Your Honor, but\nCalifornia has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a\nfact-finding to move from the middle term to the upper\nterm. It's simply saying that when the court selects\nbetween the three, the decision must be reasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't you give a\ndifferent answer to my question? Why didn't you say, if\nit is reasonable for the court to conclude that\ndeterrence really requires something tougher than the\nmiddle term, that's enough? Why didn't you say that is\nenough and (b) wouldn't preclude it?\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that my\nanswer would have to be that in relation to the\nhypothetical given, I was answering it because -- with\nregards to the circumstances of the community that the\ndefendant committed the crime in. If we take that away\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Let's -- the judge, the\njudge is on the bench. He says, there's too much crime\nin our community, look at these statistics, I believe\nthat deterrence requires something heavier than the\nmiddle tier. Nothing unusual about this particular\ncrime. I'm making a policy decision about what the law\nshould require in general. Would that satisfy part (b)\nof 4.420?\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, I believe it would.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would satisfy the\nrequirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a\npreponderance of the evidence?\nMR. LAURENCE: Uh-huh. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That was not what I understood\nCalifornia law to be or your position to be until this\nmoment.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I have not been\nsuggesting that that single factor is what makes\nCalifornia's law constitutional. What makes California's\nlaw constitutional is the fact that the constraint\nimposed on the court's discretion in selecting terms is a\nreasonableness requirement, just like Booker.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Reasonably -- that does not\nanswer the problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the California Supreme\nCourt and the California legislature would be astounded\nto think that this is what they have wrought. They\nobviously intended to establish a scheme in which the\njudge would apply the middle range, not using his own\nperception as to whether more punishment is justified or\nnot, unless there's some circumstances about this crime\nthat make this person more guilty, and that's what you\nusually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact\nthat you believe the crime should bear -- in general,\nshould bear, a higher penalty. I think they would be\nastounded to find that this is what they have created.\nMR. LAURENCE: Your Honor, let me take a step back\nthen and say that, even with the requirement that there\nbe some factor, putting aside deterrence as a\npossibility, California's system as structured, which\nonly requires a reasonableness constraint, does not\nviolate the Constitution. And the reason being because\nall it's saying is that if you're going to the absolute\nmaximum, the farthest point on the spectrum available, if\nthere's no justification offered, it will be reversed as\nunreasonable, not as unavailable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the whole problem with\nyour case.\nMR. LAURENCE: Certainly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That there's -- and\nincidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are\ngeneral objectives of sentencing.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is a term of art that's\ndifferent from circumstances.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's only the circumstances\nthat have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence.\nThe general objectives can still be considered.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what we are involved with in\nthis case and with this criminal, whose conviction and\nsentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that\naggravate, and these do require findings.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If those findings aren't there,\nit's not reasonable.\nMR. LAURENCE: That is correct, Your Honor. Let's\njust take it a step back and say that what we're talking\nabout is -- even if there are circumstances that are\nrequired, even if there are some justifications that the\ncourt must find aggravating factors, still the only\nconstraint is reasonableness.\nAnd let me quote from what Black said about\n1170(b), how it's been construed, not from the facial\nlanguage, but how it's been construed. And what Black\nsays is on page 1255 that: \"Although subdivision (b) is\nworded in mandatory language, the requirement that an\naggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the\ndecision to impose the upper term be reasonable.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what we have -- now, this has\nclarified it, but I don't know what to do. I think if I\nread the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the\nCalifornia court, which is a good court, conscientious,\nmanaging a huge system of criminal law in the state,\nprobably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely\nand they see that those guidelines in California as\npreviously understood were violated.\nAnd they're thinking, how do we maintain this\nsystem as constitutional. And therefore, they write\n1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it,\nand we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it\nconstitutional.\nNow, that would be an understandable judicial\nreaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at\nwhich point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say,\nbecause I have no doubt that your unease reflects the\nfact that prior to Black, in California, it would have\nbeen pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on\ngrounds other than factual grounds related to the\ncircumstances of the crime or offender. But I also have\nno doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the\nCalifornia system. All right, so now what do I do?\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, I think that the\none thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is\nthe fact that California didn't explicitly say in Black,\nwe are now officially Bookerizing our system. And the\nreason for that is because California had already\nimplicitly construed the system as making all three terms\nlegally available based on the jury verdict alone, and\nhad simply used a reasonableness requirement.\nAnd that goes back to Hernandez, back in 1988,\nwhen California essentially anticipated Apprendi, and\ndistinguished between making enhancements available based\non the jury verdict on the elements alone, versus the\nthree, the three components of the triad scheme.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it is the same old record\nwe've been playing. But the reasonableness requirement\nhas to be explained further. And when you explain it\nfurther, you find that there must be findings by a\npreponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating\nor mitigating circumstances that are set out. That's\ndifferent from the objectives of sentencing.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the objectives of sentencing\nare not what's involved in this case.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. And I -- whether\nor not the objectives of sentencing are involved is not\nthe critical point of the constitutionality of this\nsystem.\nAs far as California is concerned, what is\nimportant is that, first of all, the fact that the\npreponderance of the evidence requirement is essentially\nthe same as what's involved in making discretionary\nfindings within a range in the Federal system. And we're\ntalking about the findings within a range.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you want us to hold that,\nyou know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion\nthat says what California's sentencing judges may do\nunder California law, as you've described it to us, is\nthat they -- they may exceed the middle range whenever\nthey think that that is a better result, whenever they\nthink that that's reasonable?\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think California would be\nhappy with that?\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes. Reasonableness is the\ntouchstone of the constraint imposed upon the trial\ncourts in selecting among the three terms, and that would\nbe a perfectly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, including reasonable\ndisagreement with the level of severity that the\nlegislature has provided in the middle term. I mean,\nother legislatures may have provided higher severity and\nthe judge says, I simply disagree with the California\nlegislature. And it's a reasonable disagreement, because\nsome other legislature might have done what I do.\nMR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't reasonable? Why isn't\nit reasonable?\nMR. LAURENCE: Reasonableness has to be tied to\nthe policy considerations that underlie the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He ties it to that. He says, I\njust disagree with the California legislature as to\nwhether this is enough to prevent the defendant from\ncommitting this kind of a crime. And look -- and he\ncites another state which provides a much higher sentence\nfor the same crime. Can that possibly be unreasonable?\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor. I believe that\nunder the California --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then you don't mean\nreasonableness. You mean something else.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask you this question?\nExcluding capital cases, in your view -- anecdotally, if\nit has to be that -- what percentage of cases that go to\njuries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated\nproceedings for sentencing purposes? 10 percent?\nMR. LAURENCE: I would say probably a rough guess\nwould be around 10 percent. That's -- we're dealing with\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: On that question, may I ask --\non that subject, may I ask you this question: Have you\nread the brief filed by the National Association -- the\namicus brief by the National Association of Defense\nLawyers, which has a long discussion of the practical\nconsequences in other states and in California?\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And which I find, to be honest\nto you, rather persuasive on the fact it's not such a big\ndeal as we thought it might be. And I'd like you to have\nan opportunity to tell me whether there's something in\nthat brief that is not accurate.\nMR. LAURENCE: Well, Your Honor, it would\ncertainly be a big deal to California. But more\nimportantly, if this Court were to say that a\nreasonableness constraint reinvokes the Sixth Amendment,\nyou would be basically throwing into doubt the way Booker\nhas reformed the Federal system as well, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They say, if I remember it\ncorrectly, that if the impact in a four day trial would\nnormally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about\nthe burden on the system. And of course, 90 some percent\nof your cases are pleaded out by guilty, so it's not the\nmajor thing that we originally thought it might be. Do\nyou think, just across the board, are they fairly\naccurate in their description of what happens in other\nstates as far as you're advised?\nMR. LAURENCE: As far as the other states go, yes,\nYour Honor. And I believe the impact on California would\nbe a requirement of a secondary trial after the main\ntrial. But it would also impose a burden of trying to\nidentify whatever aggravating circumstances or whatever\nrelevant considerations have to take place in this\nparticular case, which can be a multitude of things. In\nCalifornia law, essentially anything can -- anything can\njustify an upper term sentence. It's only when there's\nabsolutely nothing, not a scintilla of justification,\nthat an upper term becomes unreasonable and therefore\nreversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many cases would have\nto be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case?\nMR. LAURENCE: It's my understanding that under --\ncurrently in California about 20 percent of the prison\npopulation has an upper term. So I don't know how many\ncases there are on a year-by-year basis, or since Blakely\nor since Apprendi, but probably in the thousands,\npossibly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. You had 200,000\nincarcerated when I last looked.\nMR. LAURENCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd the -- once again, the important aspect,\nwhat's -- the key aspect is whether or not a term is\nlegally available, and whether or not there's a\nconstraint that's imposed that takes away that legal\navailability as a threshold matter, rather than a\nreasonableness review requirement.\nCalifornia has consistently construed 1170(b) as\nimposing a reasonableness requirement. This Court in\nBooker said that a reasonableness requirement does not\nlimit the availability of those upper terms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any case in which\na California trial judge has gone beyond the middle range\nnot on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but\nrather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that\nthe punishment should be greater, something along the\nlines of what Justice Breyer suggested?\nMR. LAURENCE: No, Your Honor, I'm not aware of\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not either, and I would be\nastounded if any trial judge would read these statutes\nand court rules that way.\nMR. LAURENCE: Once again, Your Honor, that is not\nthe critical component of why this system is\nconstitutional. And that's not what we are advancing in\nour briefs. It's not the position that I'm arguing here,\nthat that is what would save California's system.\nWhat saves California's system is that the only\nconstraint imposed is a reasonableness constraint, and\nthat reasonableness constraint, 1170(b), has been\ninterpreted over time as simply imposing the abuse of\ndiscretion standard on the court, and that has been\napplied to all three terms. The middle term is also\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion, as is the lower\nterm.\nAnd what is important to note is, even though the\nmiddle term -- the only reason the middle term has been\ngiven the label \"presumptive\" is because the court\ndoesn't have to expressly articulate its reasons for\nselecting it. But it still has to do a balancing to make\na determination as to what's reasonable, including the\nmiddle term.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Laurence.\nMr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want\nto respond to three items. The first is, Mr. Chief\nJustice, you were asking about what would be the effect\nin California on those that have already been sentenced.\nThe only information I have was what was contained\nin Black, that only 13 to 17 percent of cases are\nsentenced in the upper range. But what the Court should\nalso consider is that most -- in most cases, the\ndifference between the middle term and upper term is\nreally only a year. In this case, it is four years,\nwhich is somewhat unusual.\nSo in those cases, a lot of the people will have\nalready served their prison sentences by the time that\nthey would be able to benefit from any result in this\ncase.\nI also wanted to echo what Justice Kennedy, I\nbelieve, was saying. California Rules of Court, Rule\n4.410 is just general objectives of sentencing. These\nare not aggravating factors. You can't take into account\nachieving uniformity of sentencing, securing restitution\nfor the victims, these aren't aggravating factors that\nthe judge considers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Rule 4.410(b) says\nthat the sentencing judge should be guided by the\ncriteria in these rules.\nMR. GOLD: In sentencing, but I don't believe as\nfar as finding them as aggravating factors, these are not\nfacts that judges in California use to impose upper-term\nsentences.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but a reading of the rule\nindicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out,\nthat the judge could take into account these policy\nobjectives.\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, all I can tell you is that\nI've never seen a judge take these into account as an\naggravating factor. And I would be surprised, under the\ncase law, if these have been ever upheld as valid\naggravating factors.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it is true that it\ndoesn't seem to be involved in this case. In this case,\nwe're under 4.420.\nMR. GOLD: Certainly, yes. Certainly, not in this\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have to conclude that\nthe California Supreme Court has misread California law\nto agree with you, don't we?\nMR. GOLD: No, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, I see 1170(b).\nAnd I understand your argument, but when I read the\nCalifornia Supreme Court opinion in Black, it says, well,\nthis is what it means. It doesn't seem to be what it\nmeans, but they get to interpret it, don't they?\nMR. GOLD: They do get to interpret how their\nstatutes operate, Your Honor, but I believe that they are\nconsistent in saying that this is a mandatory system.\nIn every one of their quotes, they talk about either a\njudge must impose the middle term unless there are\naggravating factors, or they talk about the\nrequirement -- I was going to mention Justice Breyer's\nquote from Black.\nAnd even in that one, they say because an\naggravating factor under California law may include any\nfactor that the judge reasonably deems to be relevant,\nand then say the Determinate Sentencing Law's requirement\nthat an upper-term sentence be imposed only if an\naggravating factor exists. They always talk about the\nrequirement that this aggravating factor must exist.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it is comparable to Booker.\nAnd then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly\ndescribe Booker?\nMR. GOLD: Yes. And we have no doubt that they\nare trying to fit the Determinate Sentence Law within\nBooker, but Booker is about making -- the magic word, as\nit were, is advisory versus mandatory, not\nreasonableness.\nSo yes, the California system is reasonable. And\nthat's what the California Supreme Court is talking about\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Under any guideline system,\nwhether it's mandatory or advisory, once -- if you have a\nmandatory system or an advisory system with appellate\nreview, once the appellate review function has been\nperformed, will it not be the case that trial judges will\nnot have unfettered discretion, will have very limited\ndiscretion in choosing, making these sentencing policy\ndeterminations?\nThat's the whole purpose of a guidelines system.\nThat the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you\nknow, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how\nsevere they think an individual crime is, that there's\nsupposed to be some kind of uniformity.\nMR. GOLD: Well, Justice Alito, there is\ndiscretion in our system. But it is the discretion to\nimpose an upper-term after finding aggravating factors.\nAnd I think that in an indeterminate system, as you were\ndiscussing earlier, I think that that -- I'm not sure.\nIt depends what the system is, as far as what the\nreasonableness constraints are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gold.
