BLATT, ESQ.\nFor United States, as amicus curiae,\nSupporting the Petitioner\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. PORTER, ESQ.\nIn support of the Respondent 24\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioner 42\nP R O C E E D I In G S\n[11:05 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Deneice A. Mayle v. Jacoby Lee Felix.\nMr. Chan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn 1996, Congress made an important change to\nthe habeas corpus proceedings by enacting a one-year\nstatute-of-limitations period. This Court is now asked to\nconsider, for the first time, how the relation back\ndoctrine under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2) is\nto be applied in the habeas context.\nThe Warden advocates a rule for relation back is\nthat the conduct transaction occurrence set forth in the\ninitial petition is the core of operative facts to support\nthe constitutional violations alleged. This rule is far\nsuperior to the Ninth Circuit's rule, which a majority of\nCircuits have determined effectively nullifies AEDPA's\none-year statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, I take it the\nissue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted\nunder 15(a).\nMR. CHAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there's been lack of\ndiligence, et cetera, and -- or some prejudice to the\nState in the delay of the amendment, the Court just won't\naccept the amendment.\nMR. CHAN: I should clarify that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I wrong about that?\nMR. CHAN: -- that in Civil Rule 15(a), the\nCourt has discretion and grants -- needs to grant leave to\namend after a responsive pleading has been filed.\nHowever, a Petitioner gets to file a responsive pleading\n-- excuse me, an amended petition, as a matter of right,\nbefore a responsive pleading is filed.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it was filed before a\nresponsive pleading --\nMR. CHAN: In this case --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- was filed --\nMR. CHAN: -- it was Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How long does it usually take\nto file a responsive pleading?\nMR. CHAN: It depends, Your Honor. It varies\nwith -- case to case. In a lot of pro se --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the State has a certain\namount of flexibility in deciding when to respond, does it\nnot?\nMR. CHAN: Well, Your Honor, the rule does not\nrequire the State to respond to petitions until ordered by\nthe District Court. And to get back to the question of\nRule 15(a), even after a responsive pleading has been\nfiled, Rule 15(a) does not serve the same purposes as Rule\n15(c). The statute of limitations is strict defense,\nwhich is meant to apply whether the filing is a day late\nor a year late, whether there is prejudice, or whether\nthere is dilatory motive. To ameliorate the harsh effects\nof the statute of limitations, Rule 15(c)(2) provides an\nexception to the statute of limitations, but that\nexception is limited to the parameters of Rule 15(c)(2),\nitself. So when the Court is provided with a untimely\nclaim, it determines whether or not that claim is time-\nbarred, pursuant to 15(c)(2).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just before we leave\n15(a), let's assume that we do not accept your position in\nthis case and there's potential for a gaping hole in\nAEDPA. Does the State have some ability to protect itself\nby filing a responsive pleading and cutting off the\namendments, or must it do so only if it is ordered by the\nCourt to file a response?\nMR. CHAN: For pro- --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you see what I'm --\nMR. CHAN: I do understand, Your Honor. And for\npro se petitions, without counsel, the State is not even\naware of the existence of the petition until it is served\nby the Court. And that occurs after the Court has made a\ndetermination as to whether or not a responsive pleading\nis required. It can happen that a Petitioner will be able\nto amend his petition after the statute of limitations has\nalready expired, and we would not even know of that until\nafter everything had been done.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, please, go ahead.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, if -- on\nthe scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even\nknow that the petition has been filed, because the -- you\ndon't -- the Court hasn't called for a response, the whole\nrationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as I\nunderstand it, because you point out that the rationale\nfor the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you\non notice as to the case that you have to meet. And you\nshouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to\nmeet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever\npreliminary steps you've taken. But in the scenario that\nyou're talking about, you have not been put on notice,\nbecause you don't even know there is a petition there yet.\nYou have not been led to prepare a case which has now\nchanged. So it seems to me that your rationale does not\napply in the case in which you do not yet have notice,\nand, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.\nMR. CHAN: But even in that scenario, we are\nstill prejudiced by the fact that now we have to address\nadditional claims that would otherwise be time-barred. We\ndo not get a chance to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- the problem\nwith that is that a -- the whole point of a relation-back\nrule is to get around a time bar. That's why you have\nthem. And I thought your argument was, \"Well, you\nshouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because\nwe have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our\ncase, and we should not then be presented with an entirely\nnew case.\" And so, that's why, it seems to me, your\npreparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule,\nthe whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar.\nIf you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an\nargument.\nMR. CHAN: Well, I was addressing the situation\nin which we -- in which we can answer first. And I think\nthat I responded, in the reply brief, that that would be\nan onerous burden on the State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, it would be. But, again,\nin the case that you're talking about, the very value that\nyou're arguing for -- i.e., \"We ought to be able to rely\non the notice that we have given\" -- is an argument which\nhasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis to\nmake.\nMR. CHAN: Well, that situation would occur not\nas frequently as the situation in which we face an\namendment after we have notice, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Chan, there is really no\nway for the State entirely to protect itself by -- even by\nfiling an answer immediately. That would protect it\nagainst the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but it\nwouldn't protect it against the District Judge's ability\nto grant an amendment after the response.\nMR. CHAN: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's no way to get any\nprotection against that, no matter how promptly you\nrespond.\nMR. CHAN: That's absolutely correct. And\nCongress could not have intended its statute-of-\nlimitations rule to be -- to have its effectiveness\ndependent upon the Court exercise of discretion under Rule\n15(a).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why --\nMR. CHAN: Which has liberally granted amendments.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretion under 15(a),\nat least in the general run of civil proceedings, that is\nto be liberally exercised in favor of the pleaders that are\nso -- so it's a different -- the 15(c) relation-back test\nis quite different from the general attitude to pleading\namendments, \"Well, we'll let the Plaintiff,\" or, here, the\nPetitioner, \"make the pleading alteration, and then it\nwill be there, and the Court will make a determination of\nwhether the pleading is good or not.\" But, at the 15(a)\nthreshold, it's not much -- it's not much of a screening\ndevice, is it?\nMR. CHAN: No, Your Honor. The better screening\ndevice is in Rule 15(c)(2). As mentioned, Rule 15(c)(2)\nis the provision that determines whether or not a claim is\ntime-barred. And 15(a), then, can determine whether or\nnot the claim can be amended if it is not time-barred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Chan, do you think\nthe Rules of Civil Procedure should be applied in habeas\ncases after AEDPA the same way they are in civil -- other\ncivil litigation?\nMR. CHAN: If the Court is referring to Rule\n15(c)(2), our argument is that Rule 15(c)(2) is not a rule\nof automatic relation back, in civil terms, in civil\ncases; and, therefore, should not be applied as a rule of\nautomatic relation back in habeas cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But what if we were to\ndetermine that in regular civil litigation it is\nrelatively automatic? What would your position be with\nrespect to habeas cases after AEDPA?\nMR. CHAN: Well, my argument would be that the\nhabeas Rule 11 provides that, to the -- to the extent that\nthe civil rules are not inconsistent with the federal\nhabeas provisions and rules, that they may be applied. And\nI think that Rule 11 compels a reading that if you have\none application that is inconsistent with AEDPA's provisions\nand the framework of habeas corpus, and another\ninterpretation that is not inconsistent, then you must go\nwith the interpretation that is consistent with AEDPA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you have more than Rule 11;\nyou have Section 2244, which says that an application for\nhabeas corpus, quote, \"may be amended as provided in the\nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\"\nMR. CHAN: And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, I don't think it's even a\nclose question whether the rules of procedure for\namendment in civil actions apply.\nMR. CHAN: There's no question that -- we are\nnot questioning that Rule 15(c)(2) applied to habeas\ncorpus, but Section 2242 does not give any guidance as to\nhow 15(c)(2) should be interpreted. And I believe that\nguidance comes from Rule 11.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Chan, can I ask you a\nquestion, based on your experience? I'm sure you've had a\nlot of experience in this area. This particular claim was\nabout six months beyond the statute of limitations when he\nasked to relate back. It would seem to me that that would\nnormally be the case, something about that amount of time\nwould be an issue, because it takes time to process these,\nand they had to get counsel appointed. And counsel comes\nin and wants to amend the petition, usually, I suppose, in\na pro se petition. Is it -- would I be correct in\nassuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking\nabout a delay of only a few months?\nMR. CHAN: For pro se petitions who have been\nassigned counsel, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, no, normally -- the\nissue of whether or not there should be -- the petition\nmay have the benefit of the relation back normally is --\ninvolves a delay of not more than, say, five or six\nmonths, in a normal case.\nMR. CHAN: I don't have any statistics on that,\nYour Honor. But even if it were only five or six months,\nthat would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You still lose the benefit of\nthe statute. You lose an important right. But I'm just\nwondering about how serious a problem it is.\nMR. CHAN: It can be a more serious problem in\ncapital litigation, where you're dealing with many more\nclaims, which could be more complex, which could require\nexhaustion for the -- before the federal review. It just\ndepends on the nature of the claim and the nature of the\nissues involved. I think that the statistics that were\ncited in the Justice Department study have different dates\nfor how long cases pend, depending on the nature of the\nclaim, whether it be for prosecutorial misconduct,\nineffective assistance, and so forth.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in the capital case, you've\ngot a specific provision in there. I mean, for the\ncapital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about\nmost, because there's reason to delay there, Congress\nprovided specifically for states to opt in; and when they\nopt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars.\nMR. CHAN: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And so, why -- I mean, isn't\nthe answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer\nthat Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt\nin, then the normal amendment rules apply?\nMR. CHAN: The Chapter 154 provisions do set\nforth a fast track for capital cases if the State can\nestablish certain appointment procedures for counsel.\nHowever, it did not speak to the interpretation of Rule\n15(c)(2), and Congress could not have intended that the\nstatute of limitations not apply to Chapter 153 simply\nbecause of Chapter 154.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your definition of\nthe test under 15(c)(2)? I mean, on the one side, the\nargument is -- Felix's argument is, it's the entire trial\nepisode, right?\nMR. CHAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is yours that every\nsingle objection that might be made in this entire trial\nrecord, every one, is a separate transaction or\noccurrence, for purposes of 15(c)?\nMR. CHAN: For purpose of 15(c)(2), our\ninterpretation is that the kind of transaction occurrence\nis that core of operative facts that support the\nconstitutional claims. That means that the objections --\nit is not necessarily true that one objection claim would\nnot relate back to a second objection claim. It just\ndepends upon whether they're closely related.\nIn this case, the claims are not closely\nrelated. You have a claim made of confrontation -- excuse\nme -- confrontation clause, by the admission of Williams'\nvideotaped evidence; and then you have the admission of\nevidence of a coerced confession statement. However, it\ntakes an entirely different set of facts to establish that\nnew claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The successive petition rules,\nor the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to\ntreat the entire attack as one -- as one legal theory, as\none case. And it seems to me to be in -- somewhat\nintentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you\nwant to under Rule 15(c).\nMR. CHAN: I think that the Respondent made a\nsimilar argument, based on a res judicata claim, and it\nwas noted in the treatises that were cited that you have\ndifferent intents behind res judicata and the relation-\nback doctrine, and they just do not apply that way.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Chan.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe relevant conduct, transaction or occurrence\nin the habeas context is the set of facts that are\nasserted in support of the particular grounds for relief\nunder habeas Rule 2. That reference point best preserves\nCongress' intent under AEDPA to accelerate the filing and\ndisposition of habeas proceedings.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you, Ms. Blatt, taking\nthe position that that is a tighter test than would apply\nordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?\nMS. BLATT: I think, Justice Ginsburg, our\nfundamental point is, there is no counterpart to tort or\ncontract action, with habeas. There is just no analog.\nAnd that is because there's not only Rule 2, which imposes\nthis heightened across-the-board fact pleading\nrequirement, but it's also because those pleading rules\nwork in tandem with all the other unique habeas rules that\napply only to habeas that serve to narrow the timing and\nscope of habeas review.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a -- it's a little odd\nfor the statute to say that the rules apply; and then we\nlook to the rules, but we interpret it differently. I\ncertainly see the common sense of your position, but I'm\njust having a problem with 15(c)(2).\nMS. BLATT: Yes, I just don't think it's\ndifferent, both -- regardless, you've got to come the case\nand figure out what is the relevant-conduct transaction or\noccurrence in a habeas petition. And there's the extreme\nview of viewing it as the entire trial or conviction, or\nthere's another view as -- look at it as what the habeas\nrules require, and that is the prisoner to identify a\nparticular unconstitutional conduct or occurrence that\ngives rise to a basis for relief.\nNow, under the Ninth Circuit's view, a prisoner\ncan timely file one claim and then add any number of\ncompletely different claims after the one-year period.\nFor instance, a timely Batson challenge could then --\nafter the one year, the claim could add claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel, Brady violations, or\ncoerced confession. And to have to resolve those claims\nwould significantly extend the limitations period beyond\nthe one-year period.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this case isn't as\nextreme as that, is it? It has to do with evidence\nadmitted at trial.\nMS. BLATT: It's -- well, that's true, it takes\nin trial errors, but that's a lot. Ineffective assistance\nof counsel is a trial error. Coerced confession,\nconfrontation clause, discriminatory selection in the jury\n-- I mean, I don't know if that's a trial, or maybe\npretrial -- but it does take in a lot, and I don't think\nthere's a close call that they relate to different actors,\ndifferent time periods --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, certainly in the civil-\ncase context, generally, the interpretation has been\npretty broad. And I suspect if we try to narrow it a lot,\nwe're going to have a lot of litigation about this point.\nMS. BLATT: I'm not sure about that. This has\nbeen the rule in the majority of Circuits for five or six\nyears now, since 1999 or 2000, and it hasn't generated a\nlot of problems. And that's because, Justice O'Connor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you articulate the rule\nthat you want? Be as precise as you can, if you would.\nMS. BLATT: It would be the set of facts that\nare asserted in support of the grounds for relief in the\noriginal habeas petition. And the reason why this hasn't\ngenerated a problem, Justice O'Connor, is that -- in the\nway the Courts of Appeals haven't really had to identify a\ntest -- is because they're so disparate in time and type.\nYou have an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that's\ntimely raised, and then there's discriminatory selection\nof the jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How about a case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I sue for negligence or, in\nany civil action we might -- we might imagine, there might\nbe three or four ways in which the Defendant has injured\nme, and the Tiller case, the railroad case, tells us that\nit's a single action. And do you concede this, that\nyou're asking us to interpret this differently and more\nnarrowly than in the civil context?\nMS. BLATT: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you concede that?\nMS. BLATT: I concede that -- it's hard to\nanswer that, Justice Kennedy, because a habeas proceeding\nis not a train accident. And there is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's hard for me to\nfigure it out, too, but it seems to me that what you're\nsaying is that we have a different rule, because this is\nhabeas.\nMS. BLATT: In the civil context, you always\nhave a question of, Do we let in other loan transactions\nin a breach of contract, or, Do we let in another pattern\nor practice or -- of similar products? I mean, there's\nline-drawing, when it comes up in the civil context, all\nthe time, every day in District Courts. But, Justice\nKennedy, in habeas there are more than ordinary principles\nof finality at stake that aren't -- that just aren't true\nin any tort or contract action. And this Court said that\nin the Calderon decision. And the reason is because of\nthe interest in not just the prosecutor in having adequate\nnotice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So to complete Justice\nO'Connor's -- the answer to Justice O'Connor's question,\nyou say, \"And we interpret this differently in habeas than\nin other cases, because of finality concerns.\"\nMS. BLATT: I would be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to interpret it\ndifferently.\nMS. BLATT: That would be totally acceptable,\nbecause of the distinct interest in not only the finality\nin the interest of society, and repose --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm sure it would be\nacceptable, but what's the authority for interpreting the\nrule two different ways, depending on the case?\nMS. BLATT: Well, it's not like there's a habeas\ncivil proceeding that we're asking for a habeas -- habeas\nproceeding to be different. There is no counterpart to a\ntort action or a contract action where it's liberal\npleading requirements under Rule 8, and every single\ngrounds for relief in a habeas proceeding there is a\nrequirement that the prisoner actually identify all the\ngrounds and the particular facts in support of that, and\nthose heightened pleading requirements focus the\nproceeding on that particular transaction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me ask you\nhow that would work in this case. The original claim is\nthat there was a Fourth Amendment violation in admitting,\nyou know, unlawfully seized evidence. Later, the\nPetitioner wants to amend to claim ineffective assistance\nof counsel, because counsel totally overlooked the leading\ncase, directly on point, on this particular evidence. Is\nthat arising out of the same operative set of facts, or is\n-- or is that something different? Clearly, the facts are\nnot exactly the same. Close enough?\nMS. BLATT: Well, we'd look to the common core.\nAnd I think we would argue that one is focusing on\ncounsel's performance, and the other is on police\nmisconduct. But, Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if that's -- if\nthat's the line you're going to draw, then it seems to me\nthat, in effect, what you are saying is, you can't amend.\nBecause I can't imagine an operative set of facts that are\ngoing to be much close than -- in the real world, than the\n-- than the two sets that I gave you; and if they're not\nclose enough, you're really arguing for a no-amendment\nrule.\nMS. BLATT: There's amendment all the time in\nthe majority of Circuits that have applied the\nGovernment's test, and it comes up in two scenarios --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Not if you were the judge.\nMS. BLATT: No, that's not true, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, I mean, why --\nMS. BLATT: Because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- why --\nMS. BLATT: Let me just say, on the attorney-\nineffectiveness one, it's completely besides the point\nwhat the Government's view is, because the claims are\ncompletely derivative, and the prisoner gets no benefit\nwhether he gets the amendment or not, because, in order to\nshow procedural default, he's going to have to show\nattorney effectiveness, and he just doesn't get anything\nadditional, one way or the other, and it really doesn't\nmatter which claim he asserts first.\nBut the reason why amendment occurs all the time\nis because our rule allows the prisoner to amplify facts\nsuch that if he raises a Miranda claim or a Strickland\nclaim, and doesn't allege custody or doesn't allege\nprejudice under Strickland, he can amend, after the one-\nyear period. And also --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you can amend -- you can\namend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend\nyour claims.\nMS. BLATT: No, the way you get claims, which is\nreally the -- the direct text on the rule says you can add\na claim if it arises out of the same -- is if the\ntransaction relates to the -- to give you an example, to\nan involuntary confession, you could have an amendment of\na Miranda claim that arises out of that police -- alleged\npolice misconduct that culminated in the admission of the\nconfession. You could also have a Massiah violation that\nrelated back to a Fifth Amendment claim. And you could\nhave other types, too.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the reason\nfor the -- for defining the relation back the way the rule\ndoes is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't\nwant to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I\nunderstand, is really based entirely on the interest in\nfinality and repose.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think the interest of notice\nis part of it. I mean, it doesn't always trigger when the\nState hasn't -- or the Federal Government hasn't answered.\nBut statute of limitations are not only about fairness, in\nterms of preserving evidence, but the interest in repose\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the definition --\nMS. BLATT: -- and closure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the rule is really to\nprotect the interest in fairness, because interest in\nrepose is always the same.\nMS. BLATT: Well, that -- it's to preserve the\nstatute of limitations, but if the relevant transaction is\nsomething narrower than the conviction, then the interest\nof repose sets in. And, I mean, the other side has, you\nknow, the same point -- it's if you draw it out broad\nenough --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the interest in repose\nis always there. You'd always like to preserve the\ndefense, whenever you can. That's really what's at stake\nhere.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think what's at stake is\nCongress' intent in passing the one year. And it's\nfundamentally inconsistent with that to have a prisoner\ntimely file one claim and then potentially add an\nunlimited number of claims, no matter how different and --\nin time and type --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if they all come in just\ntwo or three months after the statute's run.\nMS. BLATT: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's really not a big deal.\nMS. BLATT: -- a six-month difference is a 50-\npercent extension of the limitations period, which is a\nbig deal. And Congress wanted a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And here, it was five months.\nMS. BLATT: I think it was five months.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here.\nMS. BLATT: It was five months. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying, Ms. Blatt,\nat all on the difference between the pleading rules for\ncivil cases, generally, and habeas, where you do have a\nwhole set of pleading rules, separate the habeas\nrules?\nMS. BLATT: May I answer? I think we're relying\non both habeas Rule 2 and the principles under AEDPA on\nfinality.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Porter, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. PORTER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. PORTER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI'd like to respond to the finality concern,\nbecause I think that really goes to the heart of this\ncase.\nThree weeks ago, this Court, in Rhines versus\nWeber, unanimously approved of the stay-and-abeyance\nprocedure, because the Petitioner's interest in obtaining\nreview of his federal claims outweighed the competing\ninterests of finality and speedy resolution of the federal\npetition.\nNow, Mr. Felix's case is even more compelling\nthan Rhines, because, unlike the stay-and-abeyance\nprocedure, which is just the power -- the inherent power\nof the Court to control its docket, here we're talking\nabout the command of Congress.\nIn Section 2242, of the judicial code, Congress\nprovided, specifically, that the rules governing\namendments of habeas petitions be controlled by the rules\ngoverning civil procedure. The only rule regarding --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's true. I mean,\nwe can accept that, but we still have to interpret what's\na transaction or occurrence, I assume. And is it open to\nus, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?\nMR. PORTER: Your Honor, I believe that under\nthis Court's decisions about how you determine what\nCongress did, Congress operated against a backdrop of how\nRule 15(c) was applied by this Court and the lower courts.\nAnd in 1948, when 2242 was adopted, Tiller was very\nrecent; it was a 1945 case. It must have been -- and we\nassume that Congress, like normal citizens, know what the\nlaw is, and they developed the rule against that backdrop.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that was -- that was a\nrule for tort cases; it wasn't a rule for habeas cases.\nAnd, as pointed out by the Government, habeas cases are\nfundamentally different, in that the notice that you give\nto the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases,\nis very vague. It's just, you know, what the event was,\n\"I got hit by a train.\" You don't have to say, \"Wherein,\nthe train was negligent -- or the railroad was negligent,\"\nor anything else; just, \"I got hit by a train.\" Whereas,\nwith respect to habeas corpus, there are rules that\nrequire specifying all the grounds for relief available to\nthe Petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground.\nIt seems to me that those different pleading requirements\nsuggest that what is the relevant transaction or\noccurrence for the one is not the same as what is the\nrelevant transaction or occurrence for the other.\nMR. PORTER: That's a very good point I'd like\nto address, because I don't think we hit that -- upon that\nin our briefs.\nHabeas 2 -- habeas Rule 2 does require fact\npleading, but the purpose of that is not to give notice to\nthe other party, as the Solicitor General and the Warden\nsuggest. The petition is not served on the Warden in\nhabeas cases, so they don't even get a copy of the\npetition; it is filed with the court.\nThe purpose of the fact-pleading requirement of\nRule 2 is so that the District Court, under Rule 4 of\nhabeas rules, can perform its screening function to\ndetermine whether the petition is facially valid or not.\nThat requires some sort of facts to be plead. And that's\nin the Advisory Committee notes. It's also the\nrequirement of 2243 of the Judicial Code, that the\nDistrict Court review the petition so that wardens are not\ndisturbed with every pro se litigant's Petitioner and have\nto respond.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Whatever the reason\nfor it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say\nthat the pleading requirement being different and much\nmore specific, the amendment process should be different.\nMR. PORTER: I think that that's -- Congress\nreasonably could have said that, and reasonably could have\nsaid that -- amended 2242, for example, when it passed the\nAntiterrorism Act, and said, \"Generally, yes, the rules of\ncivil procedure apply for amendments,\" but we're -- there\nshould be a narrower rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you don't need an\namendment, I don't think. If you're talking about a\ntransaction, the question is, What is the transaction?\nAnd in habeas it may be quite different than in other\ncivil things.\nMR. PORTER: I think that the only basis for\ndetermining what \"transaction\" is, you have to look at the\n-- if you -- if you're right, that we should have some\nkind of different rule for habeas than all other civil\nproceedings, well, then it has to be grounded in the\nhabeas statutes. And if -- when you look at the habeas\nstatutes, it says, \"Confinement must be in violation of\nthe constitutional\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then --\nMR. PORTER: -- \"laws which\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what's bothering me\nabout this case is, I don't know that the Government needs\nto argue that there is a different rule. As I read the\nlower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words\n\"core operative fact.\" Core operative facts in a tort\ncase, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of\nTrain B, is that collision. And the decision that the\nfront -- the locomotive should have been lit, as well as\nthe back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the\nsame operative fact. Core operative facts. But to say\nthat a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated\nunconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a\ndifferent set of core operative facts from the fact that\nthe Defendant was questioned before the trial.\nNow, that seems to me related to the nature of\nhabeas, but it still seems to me that those words, \"core\noperative fact,\" the same words, work differently in the\ntwo situations. And to adopt your approach also strikes\nme as running around the one-year statute of limitations.\nNow, those are my concerns, and I would\nappreciate your addressing them.\nMR. PORTER: Well, I hope I can put those to\nrest.\nOn the first concern, I think that there are\ndifferences between a train wreck and habeas. Most of my\nhabeas cases are train wrecks, so I hope that's not -- but\nI think there is a logical difference between them. But I\nthink when you look carefully at the case of Tiller, those\nreally were very different facts about the head car not\nbeing lit and the rear of the locomotive not being lit.\nAfter all, those were two separate legal claims, as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Porter --\nMR. PORTER: The first one --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- all that would be required\nto allege, to take the four-line complaint -- all that the\nPlaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, \"The\ntrain was negligently operated,\" with nothing more\nspecific than that. And then the particulars could come\nout later. Under habeas, you can't do that. You must set\nout your grounds, and the -- Rule 2 is very specific about\nthat. So, it's a very different approach to what you have\nto allege, going in.\nMR. PORTER: I agree, Your Honor, but you -- I\nthink you need to step back and look at the purpose for\nthe difference in the pleading rules. The purpose is, if\nthe -- if the reason was that you have to give specific\nfacts to put the other side on notice, I would say that\nthere is a compelling argument that that should be -- that\nshould inform this Court's decision about how Rule 15(c)\nshould be read. But it's very clear, from 2243 and from\nhabeas Rule 4, that the purpose for requiring the facts\nunderlying the claims is not to give notice to the other\nside, but to allow the District Court to perform its\nscreening function to determine whether the -- whether the\npetition is facially valid or not. If it's not valid,\nthen the Warden is not even served with the petition. It\njust -- the petition is simply dismissed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you file -- can you file a\nrequest for a more specific statement in habeas, as you\ncan in a civil case?\nMR. PORTER: Yes, under Rule 81 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 11, unless application\nof that rule is contrary to, or inconsistent with, the\nhabeas statutes or rules, then it is applied.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could we go back? Because I'm\nstill concerned with the fact that Claim 1, which is a\nclaim on January 2 that police arrested the Defendant and\ndidn't read him Miranda warnings properly; Claim 2 is a\nclaim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor,\nduring the trial, made some prejudicial arguments. Now, I\nthink, just common sense, Do those arise out of the same\ncore operative facts? Absolutely not. The facts are\ntotally different. The only thing that brings them\ntogether is that there was a single legal proceeding.\nAnd, at the same time, if I adopt this approach\nthat doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'm\nrunning around Congress' effort with the one-year statute.\nSo what is your response?\nMR. PORTER: First of all, the response is that\nthe statute -- the rule does not use the term \"core\noperative facts.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but every lower court that\nhas -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it\nseems like a commonly found expression when lower courts\nhave interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller.\nIs that true, or not true?\nMR. PORTER: Not in the habeas context. None of\nthose --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not in the habeas\ncontext. I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the\nhabeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the\ncivil law, wouldn't we use the word \"core operative fact\"?\nOr would we? I'm not as familiar with this as you. What\nis the answer?\nMR. PORTER: I don't believe so. I think that\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: No?\nMR. PORTER: -- and Wright and Miller confirmed\nthis, that actually courts have tried to develop different\ntests: Is it the same evidence that they're going to use?\nIs it a core of operative facts? And, in the end, they\nsay there's no better test than the one set forth in the\nrule, and that is conduct, transaction, or occurrence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, we're trying to\ndecide what is the transaction.\nMR. PORTER: Right, but the reason why is that\nthere is a body of case law that determines -- that's told\nus what that means.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's --\nMR. PORTER: And Tiller tells us it means that\nit's the events leading up to the injury. And so, that's\nhow, I think, that that phrase has been interpreted, and\nthat's what Congress adopted --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's take --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about -- what\nabout the case law in the lower courts that Justice Breyer\nreferred to, dealing with the core operative facts and\nadopting --\nMR. PORTER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think -- they\ndon't -- I'm not aware of those cases using --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- you say let's look\nat all the cases that have followed Tiller, and -- but\napparently a lot of the courts adopting the core operative\nfact have developed that without full regard to Tiller.\nMR. PORTER: No, the lower courts -- the most\nusual interpretation of Tiller that we've cited in our\nbrief that the lower courts perform is this idea of any\nevents leading up to the ultimate injury --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But in the habeas context,\nhaven't the majority of the Circuits had a more\nrestrictive rule than the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth\nhave espoused?\nMR. PORTER: Yes, they have.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. And so, I think the\nquestion is, Should we follow the majority of the\nCircuits?\nMR. PORTER: And you should not, because what\nthose courts fail to do is, they fail to appreciate\nthat Congress has already spoken, in two different ways.\nFirst, Congress adopted 2242; and when it adopted AEDPA,\nit did not amend 2242, and it did not amend Rule 15(c).\nAnd, second, in death-penalty cases, which, after all, is\nreally the only set of cases where there is an incentive\nto delay, Congress specifically spoke. And in\n2266(b)(3)(B) Congress said, \"Amendments to petitions\nshall not be permitted after answers are filed unless the\nPetitioner can make a showing for a second or successive\npetition.\"\nNow, this is Lindh versus Murphy all over again.\nThis is a case where Congress has spoken as to Chapter\n154. In Lindh versus Murphy, it said, \"That chapter will\nbe -- the amendment will be applied retroactively to cases\nthen pending.\" They did not do anything with Chapter 153\ncases. The negative implication, when Congress so\nspecifically addresses this issue for one limited, narrow\nset of cases -- and that really make sense in death-\npenalty cases, does it not? When the State gives the\ndeath-penalty Petitioner lawyers for State post-conviction\nreview, then all of those claims are done in state habeas,\nthey are brought together, it fulfills the claim-gathering\nfunction of the Antiterrorism Act; and then, very\nlogically, Congress determined, \"We should have a very,\nvery strict restriction of amendments.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- let me ask you.\nTake the two events in this case, and as explained by\nJustice Breyer, a Miranda violation in the questioning and\nthen a problem with the confrontation clause in the trial,\ntwo years later. Let's assume that there was a 1983 civil\naction for those violations, and let's assume that both\nare actionable. Different cause of action. Is that --\nhow would -- how would an amendment be treated in a civil\naction? Based on most of the lower-court precedents\nyou've been-- would the amendment related back?\nMR. PORTER: I don't believe so. In civil-\nrights actions, there are -- the constitutional rights at\nissue are the injury. So one -- if a person started out\nwith saying their injury in the civil-rights action was\nthe admission of the evidence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You would think no relation\nback, in the case I put --\nMR. PORTER: Because there -- it does not relate\nto the same injury. In habeas, by contrast, the injury is\nthe custody that's in violation of the Constitution laws\nand treaties --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The injury --\nMR. PORTER: -- of the United States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I suppose, in the -- in the\nMiranda violation, is introducing the evidence at the time\nof trial.\nMR. PORTER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the point. You don't\nlook two and a half years back just to -- you decide what\nhappened at the trial.\nMR. PORTER: That's correct. And in this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. So what about the\ninjury? What about that? That the injury -- the trial's\nover, say, six weeks -- the injury takes place at the time\nof introduction? Or is the injury the whole time the --\nthe guilty verdict?\nMR. PORTER: Well, that the that's the problem\nwith the -- with the Warden's proposed test. Are these,\nquote, \"closely related claims\"? That is not, I suggest,\na -- nearly a bright-line rule that would help the\nDistrict Courts in determining what is, and what is not,\npart of the same transaction. So, I don't think that\nthat's a real viable alternative.\nI -- again, I think it's important for the Court\nto go back -- if it's going to create a different rule in\nhabeas, it has to have some grounding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why doesn't the 1981 --\ngiven -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly,\nbut why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? I\nthink the injury that took place from both violations took\nplace at the time of trial.\nMR. PORTER: Well, maybe I wasn't following the\nhypothetical closely enough.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I --\nMR. PORTER: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Forget it.\nMR. PORTER: Okay. Well, let -- if we can\nreturn to the facts of this case, I think these -- we fit\ncomfortably within the definition of \"transaction,\"\nbecause both of the rights that Mr. Felix is asserting in\nthis habeas petition are trial rights. Under this Court's\ndecision in Chavez versus Martinez, in this Court's\ndecision in Pennsylvania versus Ritchie, both the Fifth\nAmendment and the Sixth Amendment rights are trial rights.\nThose statements, independently, when they were taken by\nthe same police officer, did not violate any rights. They\nonly violated Mr. Felix's rights when they were introduced\nin the -- in the prosecution's case in chief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the argument as to\nwhether it was properly done, whether the ruling was\nproper, is going to go back to the time of the Miranda\ninterrogation.\nMR. PORTER: I agree that those facts are\nrelevant, but it's the operative facts that are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why isn't that\nan operative fact?\nMR. PORTER: Well, it is -- the operative fact\n-- what makes it actionable is that the statements were\nintroduced at trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, but --\nMR. PORTER: If those statements weren't\nintroduced at trial --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you've switched.\nWe were talking about \"operative fact,\" and now you said\n\"actionable fact.\"\nMR. PORTER: I believe those are the same\nprinciples, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Porter, if I understand\nyou right, you are saying that, in the habeas context, the\ncounterpart to an injury in a tort case is the unlawful\ndetention, itself. Am --\nMR. PORTER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I right?\nMR. PORTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So if that's the\ninjury, could the habeas Petitioner come in with a\ncomplaint that says, \"I am being detained in violation of\nthe Constitution,\" period, \"and I need a lawyer to spell\nout the details\"?\nMR. PORTER: The Petitioner could file such a\npetition. They have been called \"placeholder petitions.\"\nBut, clearly, under Rule 4 of the habeas rules, such a\npetition would be subject to immediate dismissal by the\nDistrict Court, because it doesn't conform with habeas\nRule 2, which requires that all of the claims be alleged\nand all of the facts be alleged.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the other part of\nwhat's been bothering me? To be specific about it, it\nsounds like a very good system. The system is, \"Habeas\nPetitioner, you file, within a year, your petition with\none claim, and we'll look it over,\" says the judge, \"and\nif it sounds like you need a lawyer, we'll give you a\nlawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more.\"\nAnd that's quite protective.\nBut suppose you said that to Congress. They\npassed this thing. And you say, \"You know, your year\nhere, it doesn't really mean a year. It means a year for\nthis initial filing, and then what's going to happen is,\nthey'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the\ninterest of justice, but, really, it always, almost\nalways, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that\nfooled, and, really, it's not a problem for them, and\" --\nwhat would that Congress have said? That's -- that is\nvery much disturbing me.\nMR. PORTER: I think the answer to that is that\nstatutes of limitations are ubiquitous in civil\nproceedings. But just as ubiquitous is Rule 15(c)\nrelation back. They go hand in glove. And Congress, in\n1948, just three years after the Tiller case, when it\nenacts 2242, must have had on its mind that relation back\ngoes along hand in glove with the statutes of limitation;\nand, not only that, but how relation back has been\nconstrued by the courts.\nSo I don't think it's any surprise to Congress\nnow all of you -- now all of a sudden that we say, \"Oh,\nyou know, by the way, there's this relation back that's\ngoing to give us maybe four or five months longer than the\nyear.\" I don't think Congress is at all surprised by\nthat. And Congress just adopted new rules of habeas\nproceedings, in 2004; didn't amend Rule 15(c), didn't\nprovide another rule in habeas, didn't amend 2242.\nAnd, as far as the potentials for abuse here,\nthe Seventh Circuit's -- Judge Easterbrook's decision for\nthe Seventh Circuit in the Ellzey case has been on the --\non the books for more than two years now. And I would\nsuggest that if the parade of horribles that the Warden\nhas suggested, about year-long delays and all of these\npotential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we\nseek here, that the Warden or the United States would have\ncome to this Court and said, \"Look, here are the abuses.\nThey are happening right now.\" Well, in fact, Ellzey's\nbeen cited twice in all -- in these years, by the District\nCourt, to allow relation back. Mr. Felix's case has not\nbeen cited at all in a published case. So, I think that\nthe parade of horribles is theoretical and not practical.\nAs Justice Kennedy pointed out, you have Rule\n15(a) as a backstop. And once the answer is filed, that\nreally cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter\nof right. Then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think that, first of\nall, the amendment may be made before there is a defensive\nplea. As Mr. Chan pointed out, that the Warden doesn't even\nget the petition until it's been screened by the Court.\nThe other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule\n15(a). It's a very liberal pleading rule. The threshold\nfor granting permission to amend a pleading under 15(a) is\nvery easy to pass.\nMR. PORTER: In Foman versus Davis, this Court\nresponded to that concern and said that District Courts\nhave ample authority under 15(a) to deny amendments to\npetitions -- or amendments to initial pleadings. It said,\nfor bad-faith or dilatory tactics, but then said even\nundue delay -- so you don't even require a showing of bad\nfaith -- for prejudice to the other side.\nSo all of the concerns that the Warden has\nraised are specifically identified by this Court to give\nthe District Court the right to deny an amendment to the\npetition. And so, I believe that those powers in the\nDistrict Court are very ample, indeed.\nPlus, we have -- the states have their own\nability to protect themselves. As one of Your Honors\nmentioned, we have 2266. If the -- if the states opt in,\nthey get the protections of 2266. States have their own\nmechanisms. All but six states in the Union have statutes\nof limitations, or very firm laches doctrines, that will\nprevent the elongated delays that the Warden is worried\nabout in this case.\nAnd as far as the notice provision, Justice\nBreyer announced the unanimous opinion for the Court this\nmorning, in Durachem, and said, \"It doesn't take much to\ngive the defendant fair notice.\"\nNow, I'd like to leave the Court with the\njudicial aphorism that wisdom often never comes at all; it\nshould not be rejected merely for coming late. We ask\nthis Court to affirm the decision of the Circuit Court.\nIf there are no more questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Porter.\nMr. Chan, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CHAN: Mr. Felix assumes that Congress knew\nabout the Tiller case, and assumed that Congress would\nknow that Tiller would be interpreted in a way as to allow\nrelation back in a situation such as this. However, as\npointed out, Tiller is not a habeas case. Rule 15(c)(2)\ndid not even have any application to habeas cases at the\ntime, until it was decided.\nAlso, I wanted to respond to Justice Souter's\nearlier question about examples of relation back in habeas\ncorpus cases. And I've cited two examples on page 27 of\nthe Warden's brief.\nUnless there's any other questions, I have no\nmore rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Chan.\n[Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
