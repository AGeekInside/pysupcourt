CANE, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CANE: Chief Justice Roberts, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOur basic principal of evidence of the need\nfor foundation explains why the court of appeals should\nbe reversed. An employment decision is made by the\nperson who made it, the decision-maker. If some other\nperson harbors bias, that's unfortunate; but it is not\nprobative of claims by a plaintiff who is not affected\nby it. This Court's discrimination cases, both in the\nemployment context and in other contexts, consistently\nfocus on the decision maker's intent, not on the intent\nof other persons.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were to read the\ndistrict court's minute order -- and this is that short\nminute order -- as saying that evidence of pattern and\npractice simply is not admissible, that would be error,\nwould it not? Error to -- if the -- if that had been\nhis ruling, that would have been error. In my Court,\nyou don't introduce pattern and practice. That can't be\n--\nMR. CANE: Yeah, if the district court had\nheld that under no circumstances could a pattern or\npractice of discrimination be shown, I think that would\nhave been error.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there anything in the\nother parts of the record colloquy, comments by the\ndistrict judge, that you think Respondents have called\nto our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping\nview?\nMR. CANE: No. I don't think that's what\nthe court was focusing on. The district court focused\non the nexus of the disputed witnesses to the plaintiff.\nThe district court did not hand out a cookie cutter\nruling at the courthouse door. The district court did\nnot say oh, this is a discrimination case, hear are the\nrules of evidence I apply in a discrimination case.\nWhat the district court here did was consider Sprint's\nmotion in limine, which was grounded in the evidence\nthat had emerged in discovery in this case.\nPlaintiff then responded to that motion in\nlimine by trying to explain why the evidence was\nrelevant given the facts of this case.\nThe plaintiff then filed a witness list,\nwhich explained what each of the disputed witnesses\nwould say in this case; and the plaintiff finally made\nan offer of proof which again collaborated on what\nplaintiff contended the disputed witnesses would say in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't really know, do\nwe, what the district court's order was based on?\nWhether it was based on 401 or 403? Did the district\ncourt explain its order at all? It didn't, did it?\nMR. CANE: The district court did not\nspecifically invoke rule 403. I think it's -- my\nreading of it that it is grounded in both 401 and 403.\nThe motion in limine relied on both 401 and\n403, the district court told counsel that she wanted the\njury to be focusing on the claims of this plaintiff and\nnot be distracted by claims of others.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, to the extent it was\ngrounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?\nMR. CANE: I don't think so, because I don't\nthink there's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you have three\nsupervisors, and one is discriminating and another is\ndiscriminating, isn't that some evidence that you're in\nan industrial situation in which discrimination goes on,\nand therefore doesn't it have the tendency that amounts\nto relevance under 401?\nMR. CANE: We have here five persons, who\nout of 15,000 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about my\nquestion?\nMR. CANE: The answer to the question is no,\nit doesn't. As this Court taught in Teamsters --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No relevance at all?\nMR. CANE: A pattern or practice is not\nestablished by anecdotes. And what we have here are\nanecdotes of 5 persons out of the 15,000 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about my question? We\nhave evidence that there are three supervisors, two of\nthem are discriminating. Isn't that some -- doesn't\nthat have some tendency to indicate that in an equivocal\nsituation, that one was -- it may not be strong\nevidence, it may not win the case, it may not be\npowerful, but it has the tendency that gets you over the\nline on 401, doesn't it?\nMR. CANE: That's why I started with the\nimportance of emphasizing foundation. To --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to -- I don't\nwant to emphasize my question, before we get the --\nMR. CANE: For relevance to exist, there\nwould have to be a foundational showing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by that?\nYou repeated several times there must be -- must lay a\nfoundation. You do recognize, I think in your reply\nbrief, that some other supervisor evidence would be\nrelevant and admissible, but you refer to the\nfoundation.\nTell us what you think a proper foundation\nwould be.\nMR. CANE: The foundation, Justice Ginsburg,\nwould be some linkage between the decision making\nsupervisor and the supervisors whose acts or conduct is\nassailed by the plaintiff. And if there's no showing of\nnexus other than the fact that they both happen to draw\na paycheck from Sprint --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by\n\"nexus\"? If they both work in the same physical\nfacility, is that a nexus?\nMR. CANE: No. I think the nexus requires\nmore than a common zip code.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if you've got 20\nsupervisors and you've got evidence that 19 of them have\ndiscriminated after making expressly discriminatory\nremarks. The 20th is the subject to the action. Is the\nevidence of the 19 admissible?\nMR. CANE: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is a nexus there?\nMR. CANE: I think, in a company that was\nnot small, where a nexus could be inferred, that there\nwas consultation or that there were directions from more\nsenior management, then I think that would be an\nappropriate foundation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. So, if we've\ngot 19 and there's a question of 1, we've got a nexus.\nIf we've got three and there's a question, two are\naccounted for as discriminatory, and the question is the\nthird, we don't have a nexus. Is that the way you're\ndoing the math?\nMR. CANE: I'm sorry. Did I under your\nquestion to be three supervisors in the whole company or\nthree supervisors out of this vast company that we're\ntalking about?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At this point, I'm saying\nthree supervisors out of a whole company. Will that do\nit?\nMR. CANE: Not absent some reason to believe\nthat they conferred or they received directions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Three supervisors, and\nthat's all there is in the company. That consists of\nthe company. Have a nexus then?\nMR. CANE: If there were -- if two out of\nthree, I think there might be an argument that at least\nit was a jury question at that stage.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. CANE: But here we're dealing with a\n70,000-employee company. We have five witnesses who are\nprincipally assailing two persons. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that it\nhas to be a case-by-case determination? There's no\nabsolute rule either way?\nMR. CANE: I think there -- there should be\na guiding principle. And the guiding principle was that\nother-supervisor evidence should be presumptively\nirrelevant, and that would be the rule in the normal run\nof cases, at least in dealing with entities of this\nmagnitude.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I assume it would\nbe addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the\nplaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to\ncall; the company would say we don't think they're\nrelevant because, as you say, there's no connection\nbetween them, and then the judge would decide.\nMR. CANE: That's normally how --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's on the issue\nof relevance.\nMR. CANE: That's normally how it would\npresent itself, and indeed the district court normally\nwould consider Rule 403 consideration if that's the\ncase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. Did I hear\nmishear you? You said it's a 7,000-person?\nMR. CANE: 70,000. 7-0-0-0-0. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's the way to do it,\nyou didn't do it that way, did you? I mean, as I read\nit -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you\nmade to the district court said that you have to be\n\"similarly situated\" -- \"Plaintiff has to have been\n'similarly situated' with other employees\" -- and you\nput that in quotes -- \"similarly situated.\" And then\nyou say \"employees may be 'similarly situated' only if\nthey have the same supervisor.\" Period. Not -- it\nwasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence\nisn't important. And then you cite Aramburu, which is\nwhere the Tenth Circuit said that.\nSo I don't see how you can say this wasn't a\n401 case. You were saying that weren't similarly\nsituated, period. And then the district judge virtually\nquoted those words.\nMR. CANE: The motion was grounded in both\nRule 401 and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be, but the\n-- I don't see -- I mean, that may be, but this is the\nargument you made, and this was the argument the\ndistrict judge adopted. Is that not so or is it so?\nMR. CANE: That is so, but what the district\njudge adopted was grounded in the offer of proof that\nhad been made here and the evidence that was proffered\nhere. The district court was not issuing a blanket\nruling that would have governed any potential --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How do we know?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. How do we know\nthat's what the district court adopted? I have -- is it\nthe order on 24a of the appendix to the petition?\nMR. CANE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't mention -- it\ndoesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the\ndistrict court is relying on.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't mention the\noffer of proof.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And didn't the Tenth\nCircuit read it to be an absolute prohibition? That it\nmust be the same supervisor? \"'Similarly situated'\nrequires proof that Paul Reddick was the decisionmaker.\"\nThat seems as though that the district court thought\nthere -- it must be the same supervisor, and I thought\nthat's how the Tenth Circuit read --\nMR. CANE: And I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the district court.\nMR. CANE: That would be the rule in the\nnormal run of cases where there is no showing of\nconnection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not talking about the\nrule. We're trying to find out what it was the district\ncourt did.\nNow, the court of appeals assumed the worst.\nI mean, assumed what makes the case the hardest for you,\nand that is the court of appeals assumed that the\ndistrict court relied on 401. Is it customary to assume\nthe worst?\nMR. CANE: No. I think it would be\ncustomary to assume that, particularly on an issue of\nevidence, that the district court was presumptively\ncorrect, and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If there's any basis on\nwhich the district court's decision would have been\ncorrect, the district court's decision is upheld.\nMR. CANE: It could be affirmed on that\nground.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I don't\nunderstand your answer. I'm confused here. What I\nsaid, and you seemed to agree, is different from what\nwas just said, which you also seemed to agree.\n(Laughter.)\nI thought that you said in your brief that\nyou have to have been -- quote -- \"similarly situated.\"\nAll right? \"Employees must be similarly situated to\nPlaintiff.\" That's true, isn't it? I'm quoting the\nbrief, from page 163. And then you say, \"Employees may\nbe similarly situated only if they have the same\nsupervisor.\"\nThen the district court says that plaintiff\nmay offer evidence who are \"similarly situated\" to her\nand then -- quote -- \"similarly situated employees\" --\nquote -- \"for the purpose of this ruling requires proof\nthat Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the\ndecisionmaker.\" That's why I thought it was fairly\nclear, since he used the same words and substituted the\nword \"Paul Reddick\" for the same supervisor, that he was\ntaking that right from your brief where you made that\ngeneral argument and said nothing about the particular\ncase in those sentences.\nMR. CANE: The general rule applies because\nthere was no showing here of any relationship between\nthe decision at issue here and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want to defend\nthe harder ground, I understand. But what Justice\nBreyer has just said is not necessarily so. The\n\"similarly situated\" argument applies under 403 as well.\nIf they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would\ntake to let in these other things and rebuttal of them,\nplus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be\noutweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated,\nand, therefore, that it is stronger proof. I don't see\nthat one can tell from the district court's order\nwhether the district court was relying on 401 or 403.\nAnd certainly, you just don't want to defend\n403. I think you're digging a hole for yourself.\nMR. CANE: No, I absolutely want to defend\n403. If there was any minimal probative value here,\nJustice Scalia, all the countervailing 403 factors are\npresent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, don't we have to\naddress 403 in any event? Because the Tenth Circuit\nruled, as I understand it, ruled that the evidence could\nnot be excluded under 403. It would have been an abuse\nof discretion --\nMR. CANE: That is what --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- for the trial judge to\nhave excluded it under 403.\nMR. CANE: That is correct. Had the \"me,\ntoo\" evidence been admitted, then we would have had to\nrespond with what might be called \"not you, either\"\nevidence. And then the plaintiff would have made a\nrebuttal to that showing, and we would have had trials\nwithin a trial on whether these couple of persons that\nplaintiff identified as potential bad actors were, in\nfact, bad actors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would that be done\ntypically at the motion in limine stage? I mean, do you\nestablish whether or not there was discrimination in the\n\"me, too\" cases at trial or prior to the trial, outside\nthe jury's --\nMR. CANE: I think it can happen both ways.\nAnd really here it happened both ways, too, because\nalthough it was teed up as a motion in limine, as the\ntrial evolved, the district court actually relaxed her\nruling and expanded it to permit attacks both on\nReddick, who was the direct supervisor, but also\ndecisions made by Blessing, who was Reddick's boss. And\nthe district court explained that, as she thought about\nit further, that additional bit of latitude should be\ngiven to both sides because there was evidence that\nBlessing had consulted with Reddick. And, in other\nwords --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that didn't present\nthe other supervisor, which I think is more -- a better\nway to comprehend this, because \"me, too\" could be 10\nwitnesses working under the same supervisor. But these\ntwo people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain\nof supervisory command.\nMR. CANE: That's correct. And that to me\nis the proper test. If the decisionmaker's supervisor\nwas demonstrated to be biased, then I think that has\nsome relevance because it raises a question as to\nwhether that bias --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not \"other\nsupervisor.\" They are both supervisors of this\nemployee. She's in a unit that includes both superior\nofficers. I thought that the issue here was simply\nother supervisors, witnesses who had worked for other\nsupervisors, people for whom the -- with whom the\nplaintiff had no connection.\nMR. CANE: And, more importantly, the other\nsupervisors were persons that were not shown to have any\nconnection with the decisionmaker with respect to this\nplaintiff.\nAnd so, yes, if you are going to define\n\"other supervisor\" not to include the chain of command,\nthen that's the reason why I think there is no relevance\nand a Rule 403 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -- I thought\nyou said in your reply brief that other-supervisor\nevidence could be relevant.\nMR. CANE: It could be relevant if there\nwere a showing that the bias on the part of the other\nsupervisors somehow tainted the decision making of the\ninstant decisionmaker.\nAnd in the cases that Ms. Mendelsohn cites\nin her brief, those are all cases in which a directive\nwas given from a more senior official to the\ndecisionmaker.\nWhat we have here are decisionmakers in\nfar-flung areas elsewhere within the company with no\nshowing whatsoever that there is any relationship\nbetween them.\nEach of the five disputed witnesses here\ntestified in deposition that they had no information\nwhatsoever to shed about the decisionmakers with respect\nto Ms. Mendelsohn.\nAnd so in those circumstances there's no\nfoundational showing of relationship, no foundational\nshowing of nexus.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there an attempt by\nthe plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to\nshow other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical\nevidence; or was it just these five people? Was that\nall that the plaintiff presented?\nMR. CANE: It was just these five people.\nThe only statistics in the case were that the number of\npersons over 50 in this particular unit, the Business\nDevelopment Strategy Group, actually increased; and that\nthe oldest person at any particular level within the\nBusiness Development Strategy Group was retained and not\nlaid off.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nspreadsheet evidence? I thought there was some effort\nto show a connection through the spreadsheet showing the\nage of the dismissed employees?\nMR. CANE: That spreadsheet was linked to\nsome supervisor named Kennedy, who bore no relationship\nto this department and no relationship to these\ndecisionmakers.\nLet's assume that -- that allegation is\nuntested, but let's assume that Mr. Kennedy was\ncorrectly identified as a bad actor. Again, that has no\nrelationship. It might have everything to do with any\nlayoff decision made by Kennedy or made by someone\nKennedy supervised. But it bears no relationship to\nMs. Mendelsohn's circumstances because there was no\nshowing that a similar spreadsheet was used by any of\nher decisionmakers.\nLet's assume that Kennedy is, like the two\nothers, Stock and Voorhees, perhaps a bad actor. That\njust doesn't shed any meaningful light on the\ncircumstances of the plaintiff here; and even if it did\nshed some -- some bit of light --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I am somewhat puzzled.\nHow many bad actors does there have to be before you can\ndraw an inference that someone superior to the bad\nactors had a motivating part in the whole situation?\nMR. CANE: I don't know that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The inference they are\ntrying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told\neverybody what to do.\nMR. CANE: And they had full and fair\ndiscovery to try and demonstrate that. But their own\nwitnesses testified that they were unaware of any\nrelationship between themselves and their decisionmaker\nand the plaintiff and the plaintiff's decision-maker.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record show in\nthis 70,000-person company how many supervisors there\nwere? Do we know that?\nMR. CANE: No. It doesn't say, Justice\nKennedy.\nLet me --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this, though.\nDoes it show whether the person more senior to the five\nsupervisors involved here was the same person or a\ndifferent person?\nMR. CANE: It is a different person. Sure,\nif you go far enough up the corporate ladder, eventually\nyou will end up --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The next step up would be\n--\nMR. CANE: Not the next step up, the next\nstep after that, and not the next step after that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory doesn't\ndepend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors\nare located, I take it, if there's a connection? In\nother words, if there's a lower-level supervisor who\ndiscriminates and that is somehow communicated to the\nsupervisor in question, and whatever -- that you know,\nthe point is that the other one wasn't disciplined or\nsomething, that would still -- under your theory that\nwould be admissible, correct?\nMR. CANE: If a -- no matter what level, I\nwould disagree that if a discriminating supervisor is in\nthe chain of command and supervises the decisionmaker,\nthen I think there's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout a situation -- let's say it is a lower-level\nsupervisor outside the chain of command who commits\nanother \"me, too\" act, but that is communicated to the\nother in a way that suggests, for example, that the\ncompany tolerates it or accepts it.\nI take it that that would be potentially\nadmissible subject to 403 under your theory.\nMR. CANE: I think that's right. If there's\na showing the actual decisionmaker could have been\ntainted by it, I would agree with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your -- does 404\nbear on the case, Rule 404 of the Rules of Evidence?\nMR. CANE: Yes, I think it does. I think\nthat if you're going to have -- what we have here is, in\neffect, an assault on the corporate character of the\ncompany and not an assault --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Have we said that 404\napplies to corporations? Corporations have a character?\nMR. CANE: I don't think the Court has ever\nheld that. I think the individual has a character, and\nthere is no character-evidence problem with showing that\na particular decisionmaker engaged in other\ndiscriminatory conduct, because I think that falls\nwithin the exception to 404. But where the\ndecisionmaker is somebody else, then what you really\nhave is an assault on the corporate character, and I\nthink that's impermissible.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cane.\nMr. Garre.\nOPENING ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nEvidence of discrimination by other\nsupervisors within the company is sometimes but not\nalways admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help\nprove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's under --\nunder 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need\n403 to reach that conclusion?\nMR. GARRE: I think you need to look at the\nevidence under both rules, the first question being\nwhether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401.\nAnd that is a very low threshold set by the Federal\nrules. The second question being whether it may be\nexcluded under Rule 403, which would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you think\nthere are situations where other-supervisor evidence is\nnot admissible under 401 itself?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. We do think that there are\nsome instances where other-supervisor evidence is not\nadmissible under 401. For example, if you have a large\ncompany and you have a plaintiff in the Chicago office\nclaiming that her supervisor had it out for her and she\nwants to put on the testimony of an employee in the\nSeattle office who two years ago complained that her\nsupervisor had it out for her, we think that that would\nnot be relevant under 401.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but here you have a\ncompany of 70,000 people.\nMR. GARRE: You have a company of 70,000\npeople, but you have allegations that supervisors in the\nsame division, implementing the same company-wide\nreduction-in-force plan in the same timeframe and giving\nsimilar explanations under similar circumstances,\nengaged in discrimination.\nWe think that the district dissenting judge\nin the court of appeals was right to say that evidence\nof that kind is at least marginally relevant, which\nwould then put the focus on whether this evidence could\nbe excluded under 403.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is hard to see what\nwouldn't be marginally relevant if you think that's\nmarginally relevant. It has to be a different\nsupervisor in a different time frame. I mean, sure.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think you've got other\nsituations as well, Justice Scalia. I think we've got a\nsituation of a general comment of discriminatory animus.\nFor example, older people just don't get it, something\nlike that. I think the -- the -- by a different\nsupervisor.\nI think even if that's within the same\noffice, the plaintiff is going to be hard-pressed even\nto meet the minimum-relevance threshold. But the\nrelevance threshold, as this Court has recognized in the\nFurnco v. Waters case and the Huddlestone case, this is\na broad threshold that allows evidence in. And then we\nlook at the other parts of Article IV of the Federal\nRules of Evidence to see whether it may be excluded --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you articulate the\nrule that separates these situations?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I would point to several\ncriteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance.\nFirst, whether you're dealing with same alleged -- same\nkind of alleged discrimination and a common catalyst;\nsecond, whether the proffered witnesses are working in\nthe same corporate vicinity; third, whether they are\nalleging discrimination in the same time frame; four,\nwhether they are alleging a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's the relevant\nfactors, but what do you look at the factors to\ndetermine -- what's the test for determining whether\nthey are sufficient?\nMR. GARRE: Well, you would look at the\nproffered evidence. For example, in this case you have\nevidence that all of the proffered witnesses were\nterminated under the same companywide reduction in\nforce. You've got a common catalyst.\nIn this case, you've got employees who\nworked in the same geographic vicinity, the headquarters\nof Sprint, the same office complex or at least the same\nvicinity. You've got witnesses who were terminated on\nthe same day --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that relevant -- the\nsame vicinity? You're -- you're --\nMR. GARRE: I think it is more likely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Opposing counsel has said\nthey are -- they are three supervisors up. What does\nthe same vicinity have anything to do with this?\nMR. GARRE: Where you have supervisors in\nthe same division, in the same vicinity, carrying out\nthe same plan, providing the same distinct explanations\nin similar circumstances, a reasonable juror might infer\nthat plaintiff's own --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if those supervisors\nRIF'd two thousands employees, and only three made this\ncomplaint?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, with respect to the minimum\nthreshold of relevance. Keep in mind, once --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No matter how many\nemployees were RIF'd, only three supervisors --\nhypothetical case, three supervisors. No many how many\nemployees were RIF'd, the three is sufficient so that\nthese witnesses could testify?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think if you're talking\nabout pattern of practice, maybe doesn't -- certainly as\na matter of law that's not a -- going to prove a pattern\nof practice, and the employer can make that argument to\nthe district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could\nbe limited or excluded. If you have got, for example, a\n-- a proffered witness who's complaining that\nsupervisors in the same complex used the same\ndistinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me --\nfor example, in this case, several of the witnesses were\ngoing to testify that their supervisors told them they\nwere being -- they were removed because their positions\nwere being eliminated, and then they later found out\nthat younger persons assumed their jobs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So take it in this case,\nand in all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of laying\nthe foundation for this evidence; is that not correct?\nMR. GARRE: The plaintiff has --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say the foundation\nis satisfied if they were the same supervisors in the\nsame division, I thought.\nMR. GARRE: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write that\nin a case as a rule?\nMR. GARRE: The plaintiffs --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Without reference to how\nmany employees were involved?\nMR. GARRE: The plaintiff has the burden of\nshowing that the evidence is relevant, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you said in your\nbrief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a\nfoundation. And that's the difference between you, I\nthought -- with respect to Justice Kennedy's question.\nYour brief takes the position that it is not necessary\nto lay a foundation in order to introduce\nother-supervisor evidence.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, and that's why\nas I said the plaintiff has to show that the evidence is\nrelevant, that it has some tendency to make a fact or\nconsequence more likely.\nThis Court in the Huddlestone\ncase confronted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, one -- one would have\nsome -- some tendency --\nMR. GARRE: And Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about one instead of\nthree? Would that have some tendency? I guess it\nwould.\nMR. GARRE: It might. And that probably\nwould be a strong candidate for exclusion under 403. In\nthe Furnco case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why, by the way, do you\nthink this was excluded under -- under 401 rather than\n403?\nMR. GARRE: Well, we -- we acknowledge that\nthe record isn't precisely clear on that. We think that\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then why should it be\nassumed it was done properly rather than improperly?\nMR. GARRE: Largely because of what was said\nin the order, and because of the way it was briefed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was said in the order?\nI see nothing in the order that indicates it is under\n401.\nMR. GARRE: Well, it doesn't say 401, but\nthe reason why the evidence can't come in is because the\n-- the proffered witnesses didn't have the same\nsupervisor. The order is on page 24.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMR. GARRE: What the court excluded is any\nevidence of the pattern --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's very relevant to the\n403 determination.\nMR. GARRE: It's relevant, but not it's\ncertainly not determinative, and we think in a case like\nthis, where this kind of evidence is the critical\nevidence for the trial -- in the case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Picky, picky, picky on the\ntrial court. I must say.\nMR. GARRE: Yeah --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me this order\nshould be -- should be given -- it should be treated as\nif, it could be sustained, it should be sustained.\nMR. GARRE: With respect, Justice Scalia, in\nthis case, this proffered evidence was the crux of the\ntrial, the critical issue. It came up not only in the\ncontext of the motion in limine, it came up in the\ncontext of the motion for a new trial. And if you look\nat what the district court said in denying a motion for\na new trial, she said again -- and this is on page 436\nof the JA -- she says, \"none of the proffered evidence\nmakes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this\ncase discriminated against the plaintiff.\"\nThat's relevance language, and you're quite\nright --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The determination of\nthe relevance of the \"me, too\" evidence -- and I assume\nalso the 403 status -- needs to be made at the motion in\nlimine stage, or is it a question for the jury?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the district court serves\nas a gateway. District courts have tremendous\ndiscretion under the Federal rules to determine whether\nor not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it\nshould be excluded under 403. So that determination is\nmade by the district court.\nIn some cases, as happened in the\nHuddlestone case -- that was a 404(d) case -- the court\nacknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and\nthen the jury may instruct that that evidence is\nallowed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if it's -- if on\nthe \"me, too\" evidence it's a \"he said/she said\" type of\ncase, does that get admitted to the jury? Or is that\nexcluded at the motion in limine stage?\nMR. GARRE: Well, if you're pointing to\nother acts of discrimination by other supervisors that\nare relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the\nemployer would come in and present their counter\nevidence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're only\n-- it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if\nthe company denies that the \"me, too\" episode even took\nplace, don't you have to have a separate trial on that\nbefore you can determine whether it's even admissible?\nMR. GARRE: In our system we put that\nevidence before a jury. If it is relevant under the\nFederal rules, it is admissible. We put before a jury\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I get back to\nmy -- the predicate to my question. It's only relevant\nif it happened.\nMR. GARRE: And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it seems to me\nwe've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if\nit happened, but we don't know how we determine whether\nit happened or not.\nMR. GARRE: In the Furnco case, the Court\nsaid that -- that the evidence doesn't have to\nconclusively demonstrate the fact. It simply has to be\nrelevant. We put relevant evidence before juries, we\ninstruct them on the consideration of that evidence,\npermit the defendants to put that evidence into context,\nand then we ask juries to draw a conclusion --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So an allegation --\nan allegation of discrimination in a \"me, too\" context\nis automatically relevant?\nMR. GARRE: No. I think you'd look at it\nunder the relevance threshold, and I think you'd look at\nit under 403. 403 is going to exclude a lot of this\nevidence. It is going to exclude the barely evidence,\nthe barely relevant evidence. But it -- we would expect\na trial court in this kind of situation to make some\nkind of findings as to why this evidence is excludable,\nand we would expect the court of appeals not to\nundertake a de novo 403 balancing in its own instance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, do I\nunderstand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit\nthought that the district court was ruling under 401,\nmaking a relevance determination, was that the court of\nappeals had a precedent in the area of employee\ndiscipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the\ndistrict court was following that precedent, but that\nprecedent doesn't apply in this situation. So that's\nwhy the court of appeals, as I understand it, read the\ndistrict court as just applying an absolute ban.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, and that's the\nway this case was litigated all the way until to the\nreply brief in this case. If there are no further\nquestions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\nMr. Egan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E. EGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. EGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf we'll turn to 3a in the white book, the\ncourt of appeals properly understood that this was a\nblanket order based on only one fact. If you weren't\nsupervised by Paul Reddick, it was not admissible. At\npage 2a, the court said prior to trial, Sprint filed a\nmotion in limine seeking to exclude among other things\nany evidence of Sprint's alleged discriminatory\ntreatment of other employees. Relying exclusively on\nAramburu, Sprint argued that any reference to alleged\ndiscrimination by any supervisor other than Reddick --\nit was irrelevant.\nThroughout -- and let me mention here, Your\nHonor, that the order of things was not as Mr. Cane got\nit. He said the order was grounded on an offer of\nproof.\nIf I may address the chronology, on December\n15, 2004, Sprint filed its motion saying that if -- it\nis not the same supervisor, it doesn't come in. There's\nno mention, ever, about the facts of the proffer.\nNever. It never came up below. We --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if you\nhave a situation that's been referred to earlier, where\nyou have four other supervisors that are presented as\n\"me, too\" evidence. They are in the Los Angeles office.\nThe defendant's supervisor is in the Fresno office. Is\nthat evidence relevant?\nMR. EGAN: It depends what the evidence is\nand what it is tied to, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is just that they\n-- they are alleged to have fired people for an\nimpermissible basis under the age discrimination act as\nwell.\nMR. EGAN: In your hypothetical was it was\nduring the same common employer initiated action, such\nas a reduction in force?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, let's\ntake it and say yes.\nMR. EGAN: Okay. What the court of appeals\nnoted here was that in this case it makes a difference\nthat we're talking about a common employer-initiated\nevent. We're not talking about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but doesn't\nthat beg the question? We don't know. This isn't a\npattern and practice case. You don't have evidence of a\ncompany-wide policy of discrimination. Take my\nhypothetical. There are just four people who are\nalleged to harbor age-based bias, and they -- in the Los\nAngeles office. No connection to the Fresno supervisor\nat all, other than that they work for the same company.\nIs that enough for relevance?\nMR. EGAN: If there is no connection, it\nmight not be, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It might not be\nrelevant.\nMR. EGAN: Might not be relevant. Let me\nsay that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you assert that the\nmere fact that it is pursuant to the same reduction in\nforce is enough of a connection.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor, because the\nstandard arises out of Article IV, which is entitled\n\"Relevancy and Its Limits.\" There are no categorical\nbars within Article IV except when -- Congress and the\nCourt have mentioned, 401 has no categorical bar. The\ntest is, does a fact have -- if evidence has any\ntendency to make a fact of consequence more likely than\nwithout it? So it depends. In rule 401, there is no\ncategorical bar. In Article IV, if there are areas\nwhere there are problems, we list them. 407, 411 -- no\nmention of liability insurance. 410.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 404.\nMR. EGAN: 404(b), Your Honor. And in this\ncase the lower courts had used 404. We did not address\nit. I don't think anybody really did in a brief, other\nthan the Government mentioned the Huddlestone case. The\nHuddlestone case is important because it said that there\nis no preliminary determination as to whether or not\nsomething is relevant. What you do is the court looks\nat all the evidence. The evidence that Ellen Mendelsohn\nwanted to offer has connections to it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well suppose you're -- if\nyou're right on 401 and 402, would -- do we not still\nhave to go on and decide whether it would have been a\nabuse of discretion for the trial judge to exclude this\nunder 403?\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, I believe that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we find that it would not\nhave been abuse of discretion, then how could we affirm\nthe Tenth Circuit?\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, I believe that what\nyou have to do is look at what the court did, because\nwhat the court did was it ruled on what they presented,\nwhich was not anything having to do with the weight of\nthe evidence, confusion of issues. There is nothing to\nindicate. And the court of appeals quoted its own law\nthat says we are in no position to speculate. As a\nsuperintending court, they ruled only one thing -- a\ncategorical bar of evidence that was before it, and they\nsaid that's wrong. You followed the wrong case law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought they said\nthat it should be admitted. I thought they went to the\nopposite extreme.\nMR. EGAN: I'm not sure that they went to\nthat extreme. Their language is this, Your Honor: They\nsay, \"Based on what we see\" -- and they have the proffer\nin front of them at that time, and they also have the\nfull transcript, which hasn't been talked about -- how\nEllen Mendelsohn's case and her theory tied into these\npeople.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How did they?\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, in several different\nways. Barred evidence of culture. We had evidence of\nculture from open remarks, that someone needs to be\n\"blessed with lots of runway ahead of them\" in order to\nget a good rating. Bonnie Hoopes said being told she\nwas too old for the job right after she received that\nmemo, being told openly and repeatedly, \"I'm too old for\nthe job.\" If there are too many --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are these episodes\nthat were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at\nissue here?\nMR. EGAN: No, Your Honor, but this is on\nthe question of culture.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't make the\n-- you don't suggest that he was even aware of these\nother anecdotes.\nMR. EGAN: We do not suggest, but what we\nsay is that what was going on in the culture -- you've\ngot a supervisor like Ted Stock, openly saying, \"I can't\nwait for RIF's, so that I can get rid of the older\npeople in my department.\" That supervisor's conclusion\nis that it's okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're conceding\nthat we don't even know that that comment was\ncommunicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here.\nHe may not have been aware of it. The supervisor -- he\nmay have been in Fresno and that supervisor in Los\nAngeles.\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, what way do know is\nthat they attended the same meetings, the key leadership\nmeetings, that took place in January 2002 that covered\nsomething very important to our case -- the\nestablishment of a forced ranking system and also a\ndiscussion of the RIF's that are ongoing and continuing.\nThey're at the same meeting. It's after this meeting,\nwhere Jack Welch is presented to the group, that they\ncome out with the philosophy of forced --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume there's no\ndispute over any direct evidence you have that the\nsupervisor was being guided by a company policy or\nstatement or the RIF program that was discriminatory.\nThe issue here is whether or not you can bring in\ntestimony that -- which has no demonstrated connection\nto the supervisor.\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, the rules of evidence\nsimply talk in terms of \"not demonstrate a connection.\"\nIt doesn't exist. If we look at the rules of evidence,\nthe standard -- and the standard we believe applies here\n-- is a two-step methodology. It would be, number one,\nwhat is the party -- the thing the party is trying to\nprove, such as culture -- is that a subsidiary fact of\nconsequence?\nSomething that's been missed in the\nPetitioner's position and even in the district court, is\nthat Rule 401 says that you have three levels of\nevidence. The ultimate issue, and the Petitioner has\nalways said this doesn't prove that Reddick\ndiscriminated against Mendelsohn. That's the ultimate\nissue. We have many intermediary facts to which the\nevidence relates. They are facts of consequence, and\nthe evidence had a tendency to show these facts of\nconsequence. So that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to elaborate\non that somewhat?\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I went through to kind of\npin down what the facts of consequence were. I went\nthrough the offer of proof. I don't have my notes in\nfront of me, but I think my recollection is right on\nthis. It struck me that the admissible evidence that\nwas indicated by the offer of proof boils down basically\nto this: There were three employees who would testify\nthat, following their dismissal, some or all of their\nwork was done by a younger person.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There was one employee who\nwould testify that he received -- she saw a spreadsheet\nin front of one supervisor that indicated age.\nThere was one employee who would testify\nthat her immediate supervisor had made\nage-discriminatory remarks.\nAnd another employee would testify that her\nsupervisor's boss had made age-discriminatory remarks.\nNow, basically, out of this company of\n70,000, that seems to be the sum total of the -- the\nkind of circumstantial evidence of culture that you\npresented in the offer of proof.\nAm I selling your offer of proof short here?\nMR. EGAN: No, you are not, Your Honor. The\n-- you have hit it precisely. And we believe that with\nculture, it's the openness of what's going on. The\nopenness. The number of events goes to weight. All the\nweaknesses and frailties of the evidence go to weight.\nAnd we never got to that portion of determining the\nweight of the evidence. The weight --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what should\nwe do then? Sorry. Go ahead and conclude. But I want\nto ask this after you finish answering Justice Souter.\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, we believe that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And finish your answer to\nJustice Souter.\nMR. EGAN: Thank you, Your Honor. The --\nthis ties in, in several different ways, if I can take\nthem all, to culture, to modus operandi, and this\nwouldn't require discriminatory conduct. For instance,\nthe story line that jobs have been abolished and given\nto youngers. That's where that would be modus operandi.\nThe fact that the office shadow rating system -- they're\nunder the same rating system that's not supposed to\napply to employees like Ellen Mendelsohn and those who\nwe are presenting, but it was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if even one of these\nthree had existed? Only one these three?\nMR. EGAN: One of these three what, Your\nHonor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One of these three other\nemployees who complained about age discrimination.\nWould that have the same tendency to show it?\nMR. EGAN: It depends what it's offered for\nbecause relevance does --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think one is enough?\nMR. EGAN: If it's culture --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. EGAN: -- and the CEO is saying that we\nwant to bring the average age down -- which never\nhappens -- but under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not talking about\nsomebody up at the top. I'm talking about somebody on\nthe same level as the supervisor that you're concerned\nwith. One other supervisor in this company of 70,000\nhas -- is accused of having made age-discriminatory\ndecisions.\nMR. EGAN: Well, if they're just accused,\nno, Your Honor. The assumption has to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, all of these are just\naccused. We have -- none of this has been proven.\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, we have not even\naddressed at any time the content of the decision -- I\nmean the content of the testimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume the testimony\nat least shows these points that you and I agreed the\noffer of proof offers to prove.\nThey're going to be met -- I think it's\nreasonable to suppose, they're going to be met by\ncounter-evidence.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We're going to have\nlitigation on these points, and they're going to take --\nin effect, become subsidiary chapters in this trial.\nAnd what concerns me, I guess, is that, at the end of\nthe day, it's -- it strikes me as though there is reason\nto believe that the proof itself is not going to be\nanything close to overwhelming. We will have had a\npotentially confusing trial on this subsidiary\nthird-party evidence. And we seem to be very close, if\nwe have not gotten over the line, of the subsidiary\nevidence, in effect, being substantially misleading or\nprejudicial. And -- and basically I'm raising a\nquestion of weight under 403.\nWhat's your response to that?\nMR. EGAN: My response, because I'm hearing\nyou talk about the mini-trial issues, first of all, as\nyou know, it will not happen here. We had a pretrial\nJanuary 29, 2007, after -- before Sprint had filed its\npetition for cert, in which we discussed will this be a\nlonger trial. One and a half, maybe two days. The fact\nof mini-trials, Your Honor, it just doesn't happen that\noften. You can try joinder cases. I've tried joinder\ncases with eight plaintiffs, and you handle that with\ninstructions. The answer isn't to keep out possibly\nprobative evidence; the answer is to let --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what --\nMR. EGAN: -- to let Sprint put on\ncounter-evidence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens in this\ncase? Let's say there are five \"me, too\" situations\npresented, and the court make a determination in each\none, and the jury finds for the plaintiff. And then\nit's appealed, and the argument on appeal is, well, in\nthree of those five cases there wasn't age\ndiscrimination and here's why. And that evidence is --\nwell then the court of appeals agrees, yes, those three\ncases shouldn't have been admitted.\nIs that reversible error?\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, I think that what you\nhandle that with is limiting instructions. It would be\nthe evidence of acts or statements of anyone else that\nyou've heard are relevant only to the intent of Paul\nReddick. Nobody would contend that Bonnie Hoopes was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, under my\nhypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals,\nlet's say, determines that the alleged statements did\nnot occur. That's the argument. And this was admitted\nto the jury in three of the five cases, and those\nstatements did not occur.\nMR. EGAN: At least that's part of our\nadversary system, Your Honor, where we have both sides\npresenting and countering. The super- --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that reversible\nerror on appeal?\nMR. EGAN: That it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Five gets you cases\nwhen the court of appeals determines that three did not\noccur?\nMR. EGAN: If it's determined under your\nhypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's exactly what's\nsort of bothering me. You are the trial lawyer.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'm not. And what's\nworrying me most about this is I will say something that\nwill muck up quite a lot of trials. So, therefore, the\nsentence that jumps out the page here was where the\ncourt of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an\nextraordinary remedy that should be sparingly -- used\nsparingly.\nIs that a general rule?\nBecause my impression was -- and this is why\nI asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401\nand 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that\nlast a thousand years.\nAnd, really, the way a trial judge keeps the\ntrial under control is to say: Well, maybe there is\nsome slight tendency here to make a fact more likely\nthan not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of\ntime.\nAnd I thought that kind of decision is what\ntrial judges are there to make.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, I thought\nthis court of appeals is trying to second-guess that\ntrial court judge unless that trial court judge is\nmaking an absolute rule, which he may have been.\nBut as soon as we get into this case, I\nthought we might do quite a lot of harm by trying to let\nthe court of appeals second-guess trial courts on this\nkind of thing.\nNow, I would appreciate your response to\nthat.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor. That requires,\nunder 403 requires, a balancing. And I think you must\nhave, contrary to what -- all due respect -- Justice\nScalia suggested, Rule 403 is the only rule that\nexpressly says \"substantially outweighs.\" We have no\nevidence here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, how are we\ngoing to -- I'm not arguing about what it says so much\nas I'm arguing about who has the right between the court\nof appeals and the trial court to decide?\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And all I'm worried\nabout -- and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth\nCircuit or elsewhere. I was an appeals court judge for\na quite a while. And I think we have never -- not\n\"never,\" but hardly ever second-guessed a trial judge on\nthat kind of question.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you tell me if the\nrules are different in the Tenth Circuit? Do they out\nthere second-guess trial judges on this kind of question\nall the time?\nMR. EGAN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If they don't\nnormally, why should they here? If this kind of rule is\n-- as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other\nevidence, any other evidence at all. It may be\nrelevant, or it may not be. It depends on the case. A\nwaste of time or not depends on the case.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor. Is that a\nproblem, and why is it an evidentiary exclusion before\ntrial?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I got your blanket part. I\ngot that.\nMR. EGAN: And so once you are there, we\nhave no quarrel if the Tenth Circuit -- and I think the\nTenth Circuit leaves room for sending it back, remand\nit, and then the court could still make rulings, as the\nTenth Circuit said, on cumulative nature of evidence,\nhearsay objections. These haven't been addressed.\nSprint has been --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, not -- I'm\nsaying -- well, you got my point, but you're just not\nanswering my question.\nMR. EGAN: I am sorry, Your Honor. I'm not\nunderstanding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I don't want to repeat\nit. And I'm not talking about whether it is hearsay or\nnot. I'm not talking -- I'm talking about whether it\ncomes in 401, 402, 403. That's the issue.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor. Our -- we\nbelieve that it does. Because the evidence has a\ntendency to make more probable than without the evidence\nfacts of consequence, on culture, on impeachment, on\npattern, on pretext.\nThat's our standard. We have no indication\nhere that the judge ever engaged in a balancing -- none.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Egan, what if I think\nthat, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been\nan abuse of discretion not to exclude it? What if I\nthink that?\nThen what happens with this case?\nMR. EGAN: If you believe that it is so\nclear, then, of course, that would be -- if you believe\nthat it is so clear that it is an abuse of discretion\nnot to exclude it, then that is the prerogative of the\nCourt to do. But it must be done under this standard,\nYour Honor; that is, the judge looks at the evidence and\nasks the question like he would for submissibility.\nWhat would a reasonable jury say, and is\nthere room for disagreement?\nIf you have Federal judges, for instance,\nwho disagree on admissibility --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I am worried about\nhaving five trials -- you know, one trial turning into\nsix trials. I mean those are the factors that I am\nconcerned about.\nMR. EGAN: I understand, Your Honor. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. EGAN: But let me just say this, if I\nmight. Discrimination cases are important. In the\nMcKennon case Justice Kennedy wrote for the unanimous\nCourt in saying every time a single plaintiff advances\nthe cause and prevails in a discrimination case, it\nserves the national public purpose.\nSo it's important. And the idea of there\nbeing cases on this, the court house doors should be\nopen. The decision may be -- may be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if I assume\nyour rule cuts the other way?\nLet's say in this company of 70,000 or\n17,000, or whatever it is, there are a thousand\nsupervisors. Four or five are alleged to have\ndiscriminated on the basis of age.\nI assume the company can call the other 995\nand say: Are there any allegations against you? Did\nyou fire people? And did you in some cases keep the\noldest one?\nAnd then they have to -- you know, they say\nyes. So the, \"me, too\" evidence works both ways, right?\nMR. EGAN: Absolutely. And that is\nimportant, because in your Court, cases and\njurisprudence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you are\ntalking about culture, what is the culture of the\ncompany if 995 supervisors don't supervise -- don't\ndiscriminate in their decisions and 5 do?\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, the culture -- they\nhave the right to bring on evidence, but the trial court\nretains the discretion. And I hope this answers Justice\nBreyer's question, also. The court retains the\ndiscretion to keep out marginal evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe, just as an\nexample, you could take Mr. Borel and Mr. Hoopes and\nexplain why their testimony should not have been\nexcluded under 403? As I read Trent, the only thing I\nhave as to either one of them is that they were replaced\nby young women in their position. That's it as far as\nadmissible evidence for either one.\nNow, if you do that, the 403 balancing\nthere, why doesn't that lead to exclusion?\nMR. EGAN: Because John Borel's evidence\ngoes to pretext, Your Honor. And pretext under the\nReeves case is something that is highly, highly\nimportant,and highly important to the trial lawyer. His\npretext evidence is twofold.\nHe was going to get a job before he knew\nthat he was RIF'd. He goes to apply for the job after\nthe RIF, and he is told: Sorry, you've got a secret\nadverse rating.\nNow, mind you, the company says: We don't\nuse these ratings.\nNow, in Ellen Mendelsohn's trial without\ncorroboration, she's isolated. That's John Borel's\nimportant testimony in this case. John Hoopes -- he's\ntold by a vice president why can't you hire someone\nyounger? Why would you hire someone age 48, which\nindicates that at Sprint, it's something that is\ndetermined to be okay. So that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if company can\nadmit evidence to show the opposite of your \"me, too\"\nevidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the\nculture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to\nadmit before -- to show the opposite culture? Certainly\nmore than five if they say this isn't representative.\nYou have to look at these 15 others.\nMR. EGAN: I can't pick a number, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And we're not saying that the five proves the\nfact as you said of proving culture. But it is evidence\nthat is relevant to it. A reasonable juror --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. There are\n15, 30, or however many is equally relevant.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You said there was going\nto be an agreement that this would be a trial or a day,\na day and a half.\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was that before or after\nthe premise this testimony would not be admitted.\nMR. EGAN: That was after the premise that\nthe testimony would not be admitted. But, Your Honor,\nthis was after remand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You told it can be done in\na day and a half. Because these five were excluded.\nMR. EGAN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry. What\nhappened here was the remand or the reversal came down.\nWe have a pretrial because we're going back to trial.\nWe have a trial on January 29, 2007. Excuse me. A\npretrial, and at that trial the court asked well, will\nthis be a long trial, four weeks, five weeks? We say if\nyou open up discovery, if they want to bring people to\nrefute -- Sprint said no.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think that has any\nbearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's\nunder review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit and that we're looking at here.\nMR. EGAN: Well, Your Honor, it goes to\nwhether or not saying that there's going to be a lengthy\ntrial it is some evidence as you look at what the actual\nexperience is -- look at the cases cited by the\ndefendant. We cited them in our brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They may have just thought\nthe game isn't worth the candle. Just thought we've\nsunk so much money into this case by now and it's just\nnot worth the risk.\nMR. EGAN: That's fine, Your Honor. But\nthey should be not take out the legs from the plaintiffs\nto try to prove their case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the problem that\nconcerns me. It is not the question of whether the\ntrial is going to last for three weeks. It is a\nquestion at the prospect that the trial will last for\nthree weeks and they will have to go out and find other\npeople in their organization and depose them and bring\nthem in to show them it is not the culture. They just\nsay it is not worth the candle. Just settle the case\nand get out. All of these things are relevant to how\nyou rule on 403 it seems to me.\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, we're simply asking\nfor balance, because other supervisors --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that get to the\npoint, though, hasn't the last hour of questioning from\nthe court shown that what we really ought to take place\nhere is a remand to the trial court for a 403 balance?\nMR. EGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. EGAN: If I might offer some concluding\nthoughts because my time is running down. The district\ncourt erred in categorically barring all other\nsupervisor evidence. It was a categorical bar. When\nyou get into the chronology of what happened, you will\nsee no indication otherwise. Neither Rule 401 nor Rule\n403 support such a blanket prohibition. As I mentioned\nunder rule 401 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think the\ncourt of appeals erred as well in ruling that the\nevidence was admissible? Because as I understand your\nanswer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a\n403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the\ndistrict court to undertake that.\nMR. EGAN: Your Honor, I think that what the\n-- my reading of the Tenth Circuit, for what it's worth,\nis that they were looking at the exclusionary order\nbased on the wrong legal rule and said, we are going to\nreverse that. And that we see nothing that indicates\nthat the evidence is overly prejudicial, since that's\nbasically all that they were looking at.\nThere could be, and we assume there would\nbe, new motions filed upon remand, in which case we'll\nanswer anything going to the merits because we've never\nbeen allowed to talk about the content of the testimony\nitself. Will it be cumulative? Is it overly\nprejudicial? We've got --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if on the remand\nthat you conceded is necessary, that will take place in\nthe context of a motion in limine and not in the context\nof a new trial?\nMR. EGAN: It should be in the context of\ngoing back and being remanded, for the court maybe to\nmake determination, but our position is in the context\nof a new trial the court can address any new motion that\nhasn't been made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a new\ntrial is required for the district court to make the 403\ndetermination?\nMR. EGAN: I think that you have to get back\nbefore the district court procedurally.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Has this Court said that\n403 determinations must always be made on the record?\nMR. EGAN: No, Your Honor, you haven't said\nthat they should be on the record, but we're not asking\nfor that. We're asking for some indication of what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought that's\nprecisely what you are saying, that that there is no\nbalancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.\nMR. EGAN: Well, Your Honor, there should --\nwe believe, if -- as you write the opinion, there should\nbe -- the court should show there work. You know, it's\n-- as I was taught in grade school, you your work so\nthat we know what you did rule on. They should follow\nthe rules as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems very strange to me\nthat we -- there's been -- the case went to the jury\nwithout the evidence you wanted to get in. The jury\nfound for the company. Now if the -- if the trial court\nis going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we\nshould then have the very same trial with a new jury?\nThat doesn't seem proper.\nMR. EGAN: No, Your Honor, if may I answer\nthat question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. EGAN: The only thing that can't happen\non remand -- I want to make sure this is clear -- is\nthat the judge can't exclude on the same basis that\ncaused the problem the first time; that is, well, it is\nnot Reddick; it's excluded. Not Reddick, it's excluded.\nAny other factors would be open.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Egan.\nMR. EGAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cane, you have\nfive minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CANE: Let me begin by addressing\nJustice Kennedy's question about the Rule 403 issue. I\nthink there are two reasons why no remand is necessary.\nThe first, as Justice Scalia said, is that you assume\nthat the order is correct. You don't assume that it's\nincorrect. The second --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- how can we\nmake that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know\nwhy this district judge ruled as he or she did? We had\na precedent. It -- it dealt with employee discipline.\nWe said, categorically, it's got to be the same\nsupervisor; otherwise it's not relevant.\nThe district judge was simply applying that\ncase to this case.\nMR. CANE: Neither --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't any 403\nquestion. It was this doesn't some in.\nMR. CANE: Neither that case nor this case\ninvolved any attempt to show that foundation, the\nlinkage between these other persons, these other alleged\nbad actors, and the decision here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- the\npoint is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an\nabsolute rule: It doesn't come in. We know why he made\nan absolute rule; that was our precedent.\nMR. CANE: Well, I think the Tenth Circuit\n-- it -- it applied the incorrect presumption. It\nshould have applied the presumption that an evidentiary\nruling is correct rather than incorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How could ut have been?\nWhat about the date problem he just mentioned? You said\n-- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in\nlimine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't\nbeen any fact-specific things at all brought up in the\ntrial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly\nnone in the notion that I could see.\nMR. CANE: Well, that always will be true in\nthe case of a motion in limine. But the motion in\nlimine anticipated the specific evidence that had\nemerged in discovery --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But where does it say? I\ncan't find in the motion, although there is something on\ndisparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I\ndon't know about the general mine run of cases, but in\nthis particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it\nis a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time. Now, I\njust can't find that.\nMR. CANE: I don't think district judges can\nbe expected to, you know, write opinions that are -- to\nbe affirmed to be worthy of publication in F. Supp.2d. I\nthink the district court considers the evidence thrown\nat him or her, and in this case all --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did anyone argue that\nbefore December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the\nmine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste\nof time? Did anyone argue that before December 15,\n2004?\nMR. CANE: That's the time when --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking yes or no; did\nthey or didn't they?\nMR. CANE: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. CANE: Because that's when the court\nconsidered notions in limine. The court was not setting\nstandards in anticipation of a trial until the trial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You said there were two\npoints about 403.\nMR. CANE: Yes, the second is I agree with\nJustice Alito's observation, or I think it was his\nobservation, that it would have been abuse -- an of\ndiscretion to admit this evidence anyway; and so that\ngets you easily by the 403 issue. I don't think you\nneed -- there's a lot of court of appeals cases that say\nthat where 403 factors are obvious, where they're\nimplicit, there's not any obligation on the court of\nappeals' part -- or on the district court's part -- to\n-- to set them forth and explicitly engage in\nrebalancing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you not think that\nthere is an important value that the Tenth Circuit\nrecognized in making it clear that there is no absolute\nbar? If we just assume in favor of the district court,\nwhen we don't know that the district court didn't take\nit as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law\nthat should be clarified for the benefit of district\ncourts. Either there's a categorical bar or there's\nnot.\nMR. CANE: I think that, absent some showing\nof relationship of nexus, then the presumptive rule in\nthe run of cases should be that this evidence should not\nbe admitted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't want that\nclarification to be done at the expense your client, I\ntake it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CANE: Of course not. Of course not.\nLet me respond to a couple of the Solicitor\nGeneral's points. The Solicitor General in his brief\nsaid three things with which we agree: the plaintiff's\nburden to lay foundation; anecdotes don't comprise --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Government\nsaid it was not necessary to lay a foundation.\nMr. Garre confirmed that point.\nMR. CANE: He did say that, Justice\nGinsburg, but that's not what their brief says.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cane.\n"
