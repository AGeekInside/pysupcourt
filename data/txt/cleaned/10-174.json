        "content": "(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\ntoday in Case 10-174, American Electric Power Company v.\nConnecticut, et al.\nMr. Keisler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis is a case in which the courts are being\nasked to perform a legislative and regulatory function\nin a matter in which the necessary balancing of\ncontending policy interests is among the most complex,\nmultifaceted, and consequential of any policy issue now\nbefore the country.\nThe States ask that the courts assess\nliability and design a new common law remedy for\ncontributing to climate change, and to do so by applying\na general standard of reasonableness to determine for\neach defendant, in this case and in future cases, what,\nif any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas\nemissions ought to be. That would require the courts\nnot to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed\ninto law by the other branches, but to make those policy\nchoices themselves. And all of our arguments here -\nthat plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common\nlaw shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of\naction, and that the case presents nonjusticiable\npolitical questions -- while all of them represent\ndistinct points, All of them flow from the same basic\nseparation of powers principles that establish, we\nbelieve, that the case ought to be dismissed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's -\nMR. KEISLER: Now, all of these issues -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's exactly one\nthing that's concerned me. They do all flow from the\nsame basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we\nshould focus on prudential standing, basically, which\ncuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to\ndealing with this on the merits.\nMR. KEISLER: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In either case, your\nargument is that this is too generalized for the Court\nto -- to address.\nMR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, our\nprincipal argument has not been prudential standing.\nThe government has focused on the prudential standing\nargument. We join that and we'd be happy to see the\ncase resolved on that basis, but our principal argument\non standing has been Article III standing. And we\nactually believe that the Court could resolve this case\nand address the issues in any order, with one possible\nexception, which is that we do read the Court's decision\nin Steel Co. as holding that the Court has to address\nArticle III standing before reaching the question\nwhether there's a valid cause of action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Keisler, what -- what\ngood does it do you to have this Court say that there is\nno Article III standing? The suit will just be brought\nin State court -\nMR. KEISLER: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- under State common\nlaw and -- and the States' rules of standing are not\nours.\nMR. KEISLER: Well, many States, Your Honor,\nhave similar doctrines of standing, similar doctrines of\npolitical questions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They only need one.\nMR. KEISLER: Well, in any event, Your\nHonor, we believe we would have a very strong motion to\ndismiss in State court on a variety of grounds,\nincluding -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not sure about that,\nare we? So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our\nwheels here.\nMR. KEISLER: Well, I don't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, you know, tapping\nthe case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I\nwould frankly rather have Federal judges do it,\nprobably.\nMR. KEISLER: Well, as I said, Your Honor, I\nthink we would be able to defeat a State common law\nclaim on grounds of State law, for lack of proximate\ncause, on standing and political question grounds that\nmany States have that parallel these; but in any case,\nwhichever ground the Court resolves this case on, we\nthink it's clear that the cause of action can proceed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if you had a\nState court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the\nState be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground\nfor recovery? And then we would get to the merits and\nsee if there is a Federal common law cause of action.\nMR. KEISLER: It's -- it's possible, Your\nHonor, although we think they would be more likely to\nproceed under State common law. But either way, we\ndon't think the elements of a State or Federal common\nlaw cause of action under nuisance could be met here,\nand we're very confident we could defeat that claim in\nState court as well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we all -- we all\nknow that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to\nsee if there's standing. There's a little cheating that\ngoes on. But -- but in this case it does seem to me\nthat you're lacking any clear precedent. When I think\nof standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon. That\nisn't this case.\nMR. KEISLER: But the Court has said in\nWarth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate\nthat it will benefit in some tangible way from the\nCourt's intervention. And that's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you have -- if you\nhave the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any\none plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough. So\nif you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States\nwould have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts\nhad standing.\nMR. KEISLER: Justice Ginsburg, we believe\nthat Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus\non the particular regulatory context of that opinion.\nThe Court said that it was addressing standing to\nchallenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when\nthe agency would be proceeding incrementally to address\na broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the\npetitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental\nprotection. The Court was very specific about that.\nThe statutory right was of critical importance, it said,\nto the standing inquiry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Keisler, the Court did\nsay that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual\nanalysis in the case. When the Court goes through\ninjury and causation and redressability, the Court never\nrefers to the statutory cause of action.\nMR. KEISLER: But it does, Justice Kagan,\nspecifically refer to the regulatory context in which\nthe case is taking place. The Court said that if the\nEPA's arguments there about traceability and\nredressability were adopted, it would doom most\nchallenges to agency action because agencies proceed\nincrementally.\nHere we have no statute, we have no agency\nproceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no\nbasis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of\nincremental relief when they've acknowledged that will\nhave no material effect on their injury; and they\nacknowledged that in the State's complaint when they\nspecifically said that the relief they seek here would\nonly constitute these defendants' share of the larger\noverall emissions reductions that would be necessary in\norder to have any material effect on climate change or\nthe injuries that they assert. That is an\nacknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not\nprovide them any redress except in connection with other\nreductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we\nthink means that this is a classic case in which the\ninjuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct\nbut of the collective independent actions of numerous\nthird parties not before the Court.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the Court clearly\nunderstood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it\nwas enough, and I would think under traditional standing\nprinciples the standing there was actually harder to\nfind because one had to go through the EPA first. One\nhad to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA\nwould regulate, and then the question was would that\nreduce emissions levels? Here the EPA is out of the\npicture. The action is much more direct.\nMR. KEISLER: But there, Your Honor, they\nwere suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory\nauthority over the entire country. Here they're suing\nfive separate defendants, each of whom has to be\nevaluated individually, and there is not a single one of\nthem against whom the relief sought would have any\ntangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs\nclaim here. But we also think that Massachusetts is\nrelevant in a completely different respect, which is the\nCourt was very specific in Massachusetts about what its\nrole was and what it wasn't. The Court said: We lack\nthe expertise or the authority to second-guess the\npolicy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to\ncompel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court\ninterpreted it.\nIn this case, the States are asking the\ncourts to play exactly the role that this Court\ndisclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make\nthose policy choices in the first instance, and they say\nthat the courts can do this because the courts have done\nthis in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing\nlike any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has\nheld. It's nothing like an instance in which one State\nis complaining that another State has dumped sewage into\na body of water that's crossed the border. The case -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many States\ndoes it take? I think, you know, if it's three States\nwho have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how\nyou draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper\nand this case.\nMR. KEISLER: It's not a question of the\nquantity of plaintiffs, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the\nnature of the task that the Court would have to perform,\nand this task is different because of the global nature\nof the phenomenon.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm more receptive to this\nkind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as\nopposed to standing -\nMR. KEISLER: It -- it -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and I recognize that we\nslip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to\nmake it difficult on you. But I take it that these\narguments also go to whether there's a cause of action\non the merits.\nMR. KEISLER: Exactly, Your Honor, and\nwhether the Court should expand the Federal common law\nto recognize this. The global nature of this phenomenon\nmakes it different because every sector of the economy\nworldwide produces greenhouse gases, and there is no\ngeographic nexus, as there was in Tennessee Copper and\nevery one of the other nuisance cases, between the\nsource of the emission and the victim that claims the\nharm. And that changes what the Court has to do. It\nmeans that any court or policymaker thinking about how\nto alleviate the kinds of injuries that are pled here\nhas to first think what is the appropriate overall level\nof greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and then\nmake a comparative judgment about how the reductions\nthat would be necessary to achieve that level should be\nallocated among all the different sectors based on the\nsocial good that that sector produces and what\nreductions would mean to that social good.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your -- your\nfirst argument when you addressed this issue was there\nis a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA. So\nyou wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would\nbe if it was within the court's bailiwick. I thought\nyour position was that the function, this regulatory\nfunction, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the\ncourts.\nMR. KEISLER: We are making both arguments,\nJustice Ginsburg. We don't think there would be an\nappropriate Federal common law cause of action even if\nthe Clean Air Act hadn't been enacted. But certainly\nthe argument is even stronger and easier because of the\nexistence of the Clean Air Act and in particular because\nthis Court in Massachusetts v. EPA interpreted the Clean\nAir Act so that the term \"pollutant\" specifically\nincludes greenhouse gases, and that means that Congress\nhas assigned to EPA the task of making precisely the\ndeterminations that plaintiffs ask the courts to make\nhere: Do greenhouse gases endanger the public, and if\nso, what regulatory consequence -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the EPA is given\nauthority to regulate other pollutants, including those\nthat do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not\nprevent California, for example, from enacting stricter\nstandards for its -- for automobiles in its State.\nMR. KEISLER: Oh, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why should we say the\nEPA preempts the Federal common law?\nMR. KEISLER: Because this issue, and I\nwould prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than\npreemption, is very different from the question of\npreemption of State law. The Clean Air Act has a\nsavings clause that preserves State authority across a\nvariety of areas, but the Court in second Milwaukee v.\nIllinois cases specifically distinguished between\ndisplacement of State law and displacement of Federal\ncommon law. It said the -- the presumption is against\npreemption of State law because of various concepts of\nState sovereignty, but because of Federal concepts of\nseparation of powers, the presumption is in favor of\nlawmaking by Congress and not lawmaking by courts, and\nthat means that the standard is very different. It\nmeans that if Congress has addressed the problem, then\nFederal common law is displaced.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's your best case?\nMR. KEISLER: Milwaukee v Illinois II. That\nwas the case in which the Court held that the Clean\nWater Act displaced a Federal common law nuisance claim\nby Illinois against Milwaukee and specifically said\nbecause Congress had addressed the problem, Federal\ncommon law had no role to play. Here Congress has\nestablished a process and it's a process in which the\nStates and the private parties here can participate.\nThey can file petitions for rulemaking, they can appeal\nEPA decisions that they oppose, and it would be\ncompletely inconsistent with that process if they could\nalso take a complete end run around it and go to court\nand ask courts to make the decisions that Congress has\nassigned to EPA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a merits argument,\nright?\nMR. KEISLER: Yes, it is a merits argument,\nbecause it says that any Federal common law action would\nbe displaced by the Clean Air Act.\nNow, the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is the consequence of that\nargument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal\ncommon law of interstate pollution claims?\nMR. KEISLER: I don't think there is very\nmuch left of any Federal common law of interstate\npollution claims, just because the field has been so\nheavily occupied by statutes. You know, all the\nnuisance cases that the court of appeals relied on, Your\nHonor, they were in a completely different time. They\nwere at a time when the Court's view of its common law\nauthority was extremely broad and its view of Congress's\nconstitutional power under the Commerce Clause was very\nnarrow.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you're going to\nhave to struggle with the preemption question sooner or\nlater. You're confident you can establish not only\ndisplacement of Federal common law, but also preemption\nof State common law, right?\nMR. KEISLER: It will ultimately depend on\nthe state of the law at the time that such a\nhypothetical case is filed, but we would welcome the\nopportunity, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the inquiry,\npart of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation\nis?\nMR. KEISLER: I don't think so, Justice\nKennedy. I think the question is always what Congress\nhas done, not what the stage of the EPA rulemaking\nprocess is. Congress, not EPA, can create or modify or\ndestroy causes of action, and that's why the Court said\nin that Milwaukee 2 case that when Congress has\naddressed the problem that's the end of the inquiry.\nAnd there is no question that Congress has addressed not\njust the general problem, but the specific problem here.\nIt has the statute which assigns EPA the authority to\nregulate pollutants in certain ways and pollutants have\nbeen defined under Massachusetts v. EPA to include the\nprecise greenhouse gasses that are at issue here.\nThere couldn't be a more specific example of\nCongress having addressed the problem and assigned a\ndifferent approach to dealing with it than letting the\ncourts work it out under Federal common law.\nThe States' and the private plaintiffs'\nargument is that the Federal common law will only be\ndisplaced when EPA adopts the precise regulation that\nprovides the precise form of relief that they're asking\nfor. There's no case that says that and that's not the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: EPA couldn't give -\ncould EPA give that relief? We're dealing with existing\nstationary sources. We're not dealing with new or\nmodified sources.\nMR. KEISLER: We believe that the EPA can\nconsider, as it's undertaking to do, regulating existing\nnonmodified sources under section 111 of the Clean Air\nAct, and that's the process that's engaged in now. It's\nannounced that it will propose standards in the summer\nand complete a rulemaking by May. Obviously, at the\nclose of that process there could be APA challenges on a\nvariety of grounds, but we do believe that they have the\nauthority to consider standards under section 111.\nAnd if the Court has no questions, with the\nCourt's permission I would like to reserve the balance\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKeisler.\nGeneral Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT TENNESSEE VALLEY\nAUTHORITY, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nIn the 222 years that this Court has been\nsitting, it has never heard a case with so many\npotential perpetrators and so many potential victims,\nand that quantitative difference with the past is\neclipsed only by the qualitative differences presented\ntoday. Accordingly, the Court should apply the\nprudential standing doctrine and hold these lawsuits not\nfit for judicial resolution. The very name of the\nalleged nuisance, \"global warming,\" itself tells you\nmuch of what you need to know. There are billions of\nemitters of greenhouse gasses on the planet and billions\nof potential victims as well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again, that just\ngoes to the merits. You make that argument to the\ndistrict court that your injunction is meaningless,\nequity does not require an idle act. End of case.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\nthink it goes to both. That is, this Court in outlining\nwhat the prudential standing doctrine is all about in,\nfor example, Newdow has said the following at page 11:\n\"Without prudential standing limitations, the Court\nwould be called upon to decide abstract questions of why\npublic significance, even though other governmental\ninstitutions may be more competent to address the\nquestions and even though judicial intervention may be\nunnecessary to protect individual rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll add a third thing that\nit goes to and that's Article III standing. It's clear\nin our cases, if as you say the relief requested here\nwill not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't\nhave to go to prudential standing. That it seems to me\nwould deny Article III standing.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nthink that this case is best like Newdow, in which the\nCourt went to prudential standing first before Article\nIII. And the reason for that is because this court in\nMassachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability\nprong of what you're asking said that the reductions\nthat were sought there, if granted, would, quote, \"slow\nor reduce the problem.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll think about it,\nbut Newdow was a case where we thought that this\nparticular litigant was not directly injured. Here the\nState said it's directly injured. That's the\ndistinction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: More than that, Newdow\nwas a case of a father trying to assert a right on\nbehalf of a child, and the child herself did not want\nthat right nor did her mother. So it seems to me it's\nworlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing\nas involving generalized grievance, I thought that the\ngeneralized grievance was Article III. I thought that's\nwhat Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a\ngrievance that she shared with everybody in the\npopulations, so she didn't have standing.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, we're not\nhere saying that this case follows inexorably,\ninexorably from the facts of Newdow or, frankly, from\nany case that this Court has decided. There is no case\nin the 222 years that announces the precise rule we're\nseeking here, and the reason is because you have never\nheard a case like this before involving the quantity and\nquality of the claims sought here, the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But it seems, General\nKatyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used\nthis language of generalized grievance as a prudential\nmatter rather than as an Article III matter. So am I\nwrong about that?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that this\nCourt has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the\nlanguage of generalized grievances to reflect prudential\nconsiderations.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But Newdow -- Newdow quoted\nthe language of generalized grievance that came from\nWarth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that\nlanguage.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I quite agree with you,\nJustice Kagan. This is not like a case in which the\ngovernment is announcing some rule of standing that\nrequires the Court to, for example, call into question\nprevious precedents of this Court that reached the\nmerits or something like that. It's that this Court has\nnever had a case involving this scale and scope, and we\nthink that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in\na circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law\ncause of action in which the Court is already being\nasked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says,\nan equitable action in which the Court has I think\nspecial abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and\nnot -- I think prudential standing reflects best the\nkind of tapestry of different factors.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General Katyal, how\nabout the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think\nthe government came in and made the same argument, that\neven though the injury was concrete, it was too\ngeneralized and therefore there should be no standing,\nthe Court specifically rejected that argument both as to\nArticle III and as to prudential standing.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right, and I think Aiken\nsays that the prudential standing cases thus far have\nbeen about has concrete injury been shown to a\nparticular person. And we're not disputing that for\npurposes of Article III concrete injury has been shown\nto at least one plaintiff, but we think that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To that extent you\ndisagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no\nArticle III?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is absolutely correct,\nwe do disagree to that extent. We think that prudential\nstanding best reflects the Court's general intuition in\nthis area that when a problem is of this magnitude and\nliterally involving the world, where everyone is a\npotential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim,\nand where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and\n32 and 40 states: \"If someone contributes one drop to\nthe nuisance, they can be sued.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't\nusually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me. We\ndon't usually base a decision on our general intuition,\nand the idea of prudential standing that we have\njurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide\nit is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line\nthat if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it,\nbut if we do, we have to decide it.\nGENERAL KATYAL: But I think that the\nprudential standing doctrine generally and the zone of\ninterest test in particular really do focus on this\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice, about whether or not a case\ncan be cut down to judicially manageable standards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll give that you\non the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with\nadministrative law and a very narrow proposition. I\nthink it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the\npoint of his questions, that these issues meld into the\nmerits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the\nidea that we are not going to decide a case even though\nwe have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the\nbetter place to address it.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I'll move to that and take\nyour invitation, Mr. Chief Justice. But before doing\nso, I would say that if you're going to give me\nadministrative law and zone of interest I think you\nshould then give me Federal common law, which this Court\nis at its height in terms of fashioning who can come\ninto court and what those rules may be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why you\nassert that the remedy here will not provide the\nrelief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the\nremedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?\nGENERAL KATYAL: We acknowledge that the\nrelief that they are seeking looks like the relief in\nMassachusetts v. EPA, which is that it would, if the\nCourt -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does? It does? In\nMassachusetts v. EPA the relief was allowing a Federal\nagency to regulate the entire society's carbon\nemissions.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that isn't\nwhat the Court said. What the Court said is that it\nwould allow regulation in the transportation sector,\nwhich would be approximately 1.7 billion tons, and here\nthey are saying 650 million tons. And so, I agree it's\nless, but I think that the -- and one can criticize the\nreasoning in the majority, but if that -- that is the\nrule of this Court, and I think that as long as a\nslowing or reduction -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think -- do you\nthink that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that\nEPA can only regulate the transportation section?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is what the Court\nbased its redressability analysis on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the holding of the\ncase and -- and do you think the -- the -- the\nforthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Of course not. I'm just\nsaying that the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. Of course\nthe case covers -\nGENERAL KATYAL: But I am talking -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what the EPA could do.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. And I'm just\ntalking about the redressability part of the analysis,\nJustice Scalia. For that the Court said that this\nreduction in the transportation sector was sufficient.\nIf I could take the Mr. -- the Chief\nJustice's invitation to address displacement at this\ntime. We believe that we meet the State's own test for\ndisplacement, which is found at page 46 of their brief,\nwhich is: \"A Federal common law nuisance claim is\ndisplaced when a Federal statute or regulatory action\naddresses the nuisance.\" And here you have not just the\nClean Air Act, you have the Clean Air Act plus, a\ncascade of a number of different actions taken after,\nJustice Scalia, the opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA.\nJUSTICE ALITO: At what point in this -- in\nwhat point in this cascade did the displacement occur?\nGENERAL KATYAL: We think that the Court\ndoesn't really need to get into it. And for the -- the\nreason is this: Displacement actions are extremely\nrare, Federal common law actions are rare, so we don't\nthink you should announce some sort of general standard\nfor when displacement occurs. It's a more case-by-case\nsituation.\nHere you have undoubted evidence that it\noccurred -- that it has occurred because of a number of\ndifferent things.\nJUSTICE ALITO: We don't know what EPA may\ndo down the road, we don't know what Congress may do\ndown the road. So don't we have to have some idea about\nwhen this takes place in order so that this precedent\nmay -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Certainly -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- be applied to the future\ncourse of conduct?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Certainly, Justice Alito, I\nthink it's appropriate for the Court to look at what\nhas -- what is happening right now. And here's what's\nhappening. First, in December 2009 the EPA issued an\nendangerment finding, finding these greenhouse gases\nsignificant pollutants.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Katyal, suppose\nthat the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment\nfinding. Would your argument still apply?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think that that would\npresent a difficult case, because it would be the one\nlike the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act\nalone. And I think that what the States themselves\nacknowledge and what the language of Milwaukee II -\nexcuse me -- Milwaukee I says in it is that -- and this\nis at page 107 of the opinion: \"It may happen that new\nFederal laws and new Federal regulations may in time\npreempt the Federal common law of nuisance. We think\nthat both together presents the best and easiest case\nfor displacement,\" and you have that here. You have not\njust the endangerment finding; you have the EPA\nregulating all passenger cars, all light motor vehicles\nright now.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if I insisted you answer\nthe hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be?\nNo endangerment finding. Is there displacement?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think that it's a -- it's\na difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I\nthink it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler\nsuggests. But I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it -- I don't\nwant to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is\nit that much more difficult? It's just -- I mean, it's\nsort of like the negative commerce clause, right? The\nfact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a\nparticular area means that the ball has passed from the\ncourts to the agency, to the executive branch, and\nthey've made an implicit decision not to regulate a\nparticular question.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I think that\nthere's a good argument to be made. I imagine the\nargument on the other side that you'll hear in a moment\nis that the Clean Air Act doesn't look precisely like\nthe Clean Water Act in terms of forcing the agency to\ndecide various things.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess that would\nbe a preemption question rather than -- rather than a\ndisplacement question.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think that very well may\nbe. And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you\nhad asked before about State common law causes of action\nand whether they would be -- they would kind -- the\nexistence of those would somehow mean that the Court\nshould either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a\nway. And we think that the same arguments that prohibit\nthe Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal\ncommon law cause of action for displacement very well\nmay be preemption questions as well that could be\naddressed down the road with respect to State common law\nactions.\nAnd we don't think the Court should be\ntroubled by the existence of a potential State common\nlaw cause of action. It's just like Milwaukee II, in\nwhich the dissenters made precisely this argument. They\nsaid: If you don't recognize it, then the States will\nregulate it and it will balkanize and the like. And\nwhat the majority said is: That's a question for down\nthe road; the question for now is has displacement\noccurred?\nJUSTICE ALITO: I understand that that's not\nthe issue here, but does the government have a position\non that if -- if New York law provides exactly the same\npublic nuisance claim that is now asserted under Federal\ncommon law, would that be consistent?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think we have\na position at this time on that. That's I think an\nenormously complicated question we can get to at an\nappropriate time. Our central -- our central submission\nto you on displacement is this: That there is literally\nno precedent for the argument that they are making here,\nwhich is that the Federal Government has to regulate the\nprecise jot and tittle, the specific relief that they\nare seeking before displacement occurs.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have a position on\nwhether there's anything to be displaced here? Do you\nhave a position on whether there is, in fact, a Federal\ncause of action?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, we think, again, the\nCourt doesn't need to get into that question because\nit -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law\ncauses of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and\nthere have been two that the Federal Government has\nfiled since 1970 and three that we can find all together\nin the Federal courts of appeals, all of which have\nfailed for various displacement reasons, and the others.\nWe think none of those look anything like\nthe -- the common law cause of action here. And, so, it\nwould at least require this Court to extend quite\ndramatically Federal common law to cover this type of\nsituation in which everyone is a potential perpetrator\nand everyone is a potential victim. And it would\nrequire the Court, in fashioning relief, to think\nthrough a number of things that the Federal courts\nhaven't ever had to grapple with from the nature -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, if there were -- if\nthere were no Clean Air Act, you would still say that\nthis suit, a suit like this, would -- would fail\nprudential standing, but you don't have a position as to\nwhether there would be a claim under Federal common law?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. We think\nit would still fail prudential standing because of the\nquantity and quality of the nature of the problem here,\nand the multitude of different policy judgments that\nwould be required -- that this Court would be required\nto undertake to adjudicate a Federal common law cause of\naction in the absence of a statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm sorry, General,\nbecause I was understanding your answer differently, and\nmaybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no\nlegislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal\nlaw cause of action. Is that correct?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I doubted that there was\nprudential standing.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, but as to whether the\ncause of action exists under Federal common law in a\ncase like this, where you said it was so different from\nthe other Federal common law cases that the Court has\nseen.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I -- I -- I think I put it\nas we doubt it. I mean, I think that it would require a\ndramatic extension, Justice Kagan, of a case like\nTennessee Copper and the other cases that this Court has\nheard, which are essentially: A pollutes a river or\nsomething and hurts B. A here is the world and B is the\nworld, and that is such a difference in scale and scope\nto pose enormously difficult questions as to whether\nthis Court should recognize such a cause of action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Same -- same hypothetical,\nassume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal\ncommon law. What about State law? Does State common\nlaw become displaced because it's a matter of Federal\nconcern? We don't -- we don't -- we don't usually have\npreemption of Federal common law.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well -- well, there may be\narguments, Justice Kennedy -- I'm not sure if the\npremise of your question has a Clean Air Act in\nexistence or not. There may be some sort of arguments\nabout displacement or preemption under the Clean Air\nAct -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The hypothetical is that\nthe Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Then I think that again for\npurposes of State common law, I think this Court would\napproach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee\nII, which is to say that's a really separate\npolicy-based question that the Court doesn't use to\nanswer the questions about whether a cause of action\nshould be recognized or whether displacement has\noccurred. But I would point out that the States that\nhave sued generally have doctrines like prudential\nstanding, doctrines like political question, that may\nvery well bar the reaching of these claims in State\ncourts as well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be very odd to\nsay that there's no Federal common law, but also that\nthere's no -- no displacement of State law. That -\nthat seems to me odd.\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's precisely the\nsituation that -- that this Court was grappling with in\nMilwaukee II, and it said that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we get to -- to the\nsituation that now exists? They are seeking standards\nfor existing sources. I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you\nagree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new\nsource or a modified source; we're talking about\nexisting sources. Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set\nstandards for existing sources?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice\nGinsburg. Let me say three things about that. First\nis, EPA is currently regulating existing sources. To\nthe extent that a power plant is modified in any way to\nincrease carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and\nthis is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then\nthose power plants right now are subject to regulation.\nIndeed, one has already had to get a permit. These\nregulations just went into effect in January 2011 for\nexisting power plants that seek to modify.\nSecond, there is a settlement agreement in\nplace that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how\nand whether to regulate existing power sources, the\nexisting stationary sources.\nAnd third, and I think most fundamentally,\nthere is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that\nthe government must regulate the specific industry, the\nspecific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for\ndisplacement to occur. Rather, Sea Clammers and\nMilwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong\nquestion. And so long as the nuisance is being\naddressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being\naddressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in\nthe area of global warming, and an executive order that\nsays that fighting global warming is one of the\ngovernment's highest priorities -- and concrete steps\ntaken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the\n400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA\nhas done with its experts to appropriately regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common\nlaw court of action doing something which would frankly\nput you all at sea in terms of the complexity,\neconomics, international nature of the problem.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, could I take you\nback on that last point to another threshold question,\nwhich is the political question doctrine? Because a lot\nof your arguments really sound like prongs two and three\nfrom Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go\nthere, that we should instead address this matter on\nprudential standing grounds. But the political question\ndoctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of\narguments you're making. So why not?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Kagan, I'm\nnot going to tarry too long on which different way we\nshould win this case. I think either is an appropriate\nway.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KATYAL: But I think that the\nprudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because\nit -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including\nthe fact that this is a Federal common law cause of\naction where the Court is fashioning relief in the first\nplace, as opposed to the political question doctrine\nwhich looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of\nthe adjudication.\nWe agree that -- that the political question\ndoctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case,\nbut we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this\nCourt can handle this case on prudential standing first\nand recognize that this is an unprecedented action\ninvolving literally the world, and it is not suited for\njudicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from\nthe precepts of the prudential standing doctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not an area where\nthe Court can't go. To take a political question we all\nagree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the\nimpeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court\ndoes deal with the subject matter all the time. It\nreviews decisions that the EPA has made.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, we quite\nagree, and that is why we say that if a statute were -\nwere announced to provide standards, that that would\nprovide a way around the political question problem that\nexists in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nGeneral Underwood.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case rests on the longstanding\nfundamental authority of the States to protect their\nland, their natural resources, and their citizens from\nair pollution emitted in other States. It rests on\nthree propositions: One, the interests of the States\nare harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as\nthe five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are\nsignificant contributors to it; and, three, these\ndefendants could take reasonable, cost-effective\nmeasures to reduce their emissions in a way that would\nslow the effects of global warming.\nWe will have to prove these propositions,\nand after we do the district court will have to\ndetermine whether it can frame an appropriate equitable\ninjunction. That's what discovery and trials are for.\nBut this Court should not close the courthouse door to\nthis case at the outset. The common law action for\npublic nuisance has been around for hundreds of years,\nhas been adapted by courts to cover new environmental\nthreats, and there's no reason why the courts can't do\nthe same thing here.\nThe defendants say there are too many\nplaintiffs, too many potential defendants, and that\nadjudication of this case will require courts to solve\nthe entire problem of global warming, but that is simply\nnot so.\nOn the plaintiffs' side, this is about the\nStates. We are alleging the kind of injury to States\nthat has been traditionally recognized by this Court;\ntheir lands, their citizens, their businesses are being\ninjured by pollution emitted in other States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Underwood, the -\nthe relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set\nstandards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing\nthat EPA does. I mean, Congress set up the EPA to\npromulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the\nrelief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district\njudge, who does not have the resources, the expertise,\nas a kind of super EPA.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It's not as a super EPA.\nIt's something much smaller. It's a different question.\nInterstate pollution disputes have historically been\nentrusted to the courts, including the determination of\nhow much is unreasonable, which is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we just\nconcentrate on I think the relief you want, you say:\nDistrict court, if we pass everything else, you set\nemissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set\na cap, and then annually you require further reductions.\nWell, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it\nsets emission standards.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's also like what\nthe Court did in Tennessee Copper. That is to say, this\ncase doesn't ask the Court to decide how much, contrary\nto what Petitioners suggest, to decide how much emission\nreduction is required to solve the whole problem of\nglobal warming and then allocate a portion to these\ndefendants. It asks the Court to do something simpler,\nand that is to decide whether these defendants can take\nreasonable cost-effective measures that would help to\nslow the pace of global warming. So -\nJUSTICE ALITO: How does a district judge\ndecide what is reasonable and cost-effective? There are\nconsiderations -- this is not a situation in which the\nemission of greenhouse gases can be totally prohibited.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There are other -- there are\ncountervailing interests. So how does the court -- how\ncan a district court balance those interests?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I would say two things\nabout that. One, it was also true in Tennessee Copper\nthat it was not the case that the sulfur emissions could\nbe eliminated or that the plant was to be put out of\nbusiness. The Court in that case ordered a reduction of\nsulfur, a quite specific reduction of sulfur emissions\nin one season and more in another season. And how\ndoes -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But do you seriously argue\nthis isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more\ncomplicated than that case?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It's somewhat more -- it's\nlarger. I don't know if it's more complicated. The way\na court would do that is presumably the way it did it in\nTennessee Copper. That is, there could be expert\ntestimony, there could also be evidence about whether -\nwhat other emitters are doing, what they do that is\nfeasible and cost-effective to reduce their emissions.\nIn Tennessee Copper, one of the defendants settled, and\nthe other was subject to an order, and it would have\nbeen available to the Court to look to what the settling\ndefendant did for some indication of what the\nnonsettling defendant might well be ordered to do. So\nthere is evidence available from which a court could\nconclude what is reasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the\n-- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that\nwould have to be undertaken to decide what level of\nemissions are reasonable in light of the threat of\nglobal -- global warming?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The available technology,\nthe cost of that technology -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Obviously the\ngreatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of\ncourse, to shut down the power plants, right?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, we haven't asked for\nthat and nobody suggests that that would be appropriate.\nIt's not, any more than it was in Tennessee Copper.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because -- right.\nBut I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of\ndealing with global warming is that there are costs and\nbenefits on both sides, and you have to determine how\nmuch you want to readjust the world economy to address\nglobal warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden\nto post -- to impose on a district court judge.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's also a burden\nthat the plaintiffs would have to bear. That is to say,\nwe have alleged, and are entitled to try to prove -- and\nwe might fail; that would be for the district judge to\ndetermine -- that \"the defendants have available to them\npractical, feasible\" -- I'm reading from the\ncomplaint -- \"and economically viable options for\nreducing carbon dioxide emissions without significantly\nincreasing the cost of electricity to their customers,\nincluding changing fuels, improving efficiency, and\naltering\" -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're dealing with\nan electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an\narea, but certainly a vast area here. And the fact that\nthey can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't\naffect their customers is based on the fact that other\npower plants that are part of the grid will serve part\nof those -- will serve the customers' needs to some\nextent.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It may or may not be based\non this. These are facts that can be proven or not\nproven at trial.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, they're\nusually facts that are determined by an administrative\nagency. I mean, even just reading that part of your\ncomplaint, it sounds like the paradigmatic thing that\nadministrative agencies do rather than courts.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: But if there were no agency\nand if there were no Clean Air Act and somebody was\nshooting poison into the air in a way that injured\npeople in another State, the States would have the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if there were no and if\nthere were no, we would be living in a different world.\nThere is an administrative agency and there is a Clean\nAir Act.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: But those -- those are\nquestions about what has been called the merits or\ndisplacement. The question of Article III standing, the\nquestion of justiciability, the question of political\nquestion, those are the same questions whether there's\nan agency or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We can concede that, but\nwe still have the displacement argument -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY -- in front of us, and I\nthought that's what we were addressing.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: We can talk about the\ndisplacement argument. I just wanted to be sure that -\nI understood the question of standards to be a question\naddressed to the political question point. And even if\nit might be desirable to have an agency set standards,\nit is not something that is beyond the power of a court\nto do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can the courts set a tax?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The agency -- the agency\nis engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another\nfacet of this case, the potential for conflict. The\nEPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it\ndoes have authority to classify this as a pollutant and\nit has taken the first steps.\nOne argument that the EPA -- that the United\nStates is presenting is the way agencies go about this\nis incrementally, so they're starting with motor\nvehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and\nthen they'll get to maybe where you are. But you want\nthe Court to start with the existing sources, to set\nlimits that may be in conflict with what an existing\nagency is doing.\nDo we ignore the fact that the EPA is there\nand that it is regulating in this area?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, we do not ignore that.\nThis is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to\narrive in this Court, because what is offered as\ndisplacing is something that is said to be imminent, not\nsomething that actually exists, and something that is\nimminent may never happen. It was, of course, for that\nreason that I believe the United States suggested a GBR\nand we suggested that the case be dismissed so that the\nlower courts could deal with the unfolding events as\nthey occur.\nBut the case is here now, and there is no\nFederal statute or regulation that currently regulates\nthe emission of greenhouse gases by existing unmodified\npower plants, like the ones operated by the defendants.\nAnd the Clean Air Act works very differently from the\nClean Water Act. It did not put in place a permit\nsystem for all emissions when it was enacted in 1970.\nUnlike the Clean Water Act 2 years later, which forbids\nall discharges until they're authorized by permit, the\nClean Air Act doesn't regulate anything until the EPA\nmakes findings and imposes restrictions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I suppose there\nwere reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and\nyour suit would override those determinations.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, our suit is consistent\nwith those determinations. That is to say, the design\nof the statute leaves preexisting law in place until EPA\nsteps in.\nIf the Clean Air Act were thought to\ndisplace the common law before any regulation occurred,\nthat would mean the immediate effect of this\nantipollution law in 1970 was to reduce pollution\ncontrol because -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much -- how much\nregulation do you need before you would admit that there\nis displacement? Is it -- is it a preemption analysis\nthat you're adopting or a displacement analysis?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It's a displacement\nanalysis. I believe it's a displacement analysis.\nWhat -- what we start from is that the States have a\nhistoric right to go to court under the Federal common\nlaw and that to -- to -- to deal with the problem of\ninterstate pollution, and that that was a promise that\nthey obtained, the Federal remedy, in exchange for the\nsurrender of sovereignty in joining the Union. So there\nhas to be -- there's a strong Federal interest in there\nbeing a Federal remedy.\nNow, when the Clean Air Act was -- was\npassed, without any regulations, if it displaced the\nFederal common law, there would be no Federal law\napplicable at all, because the Federal common law would\nbe displaced and there would be no Federal regulatory\nlaw. The States would have recourse at that point to\nState common law, as has been suggested. That would be\navailable still.\nBut this Court has said repeatedly, and it's\ncorrect, that there is a strong Federal interest in\nregulating this subject matter of interstate pollution\nwith Federal law. Federal common law is the default\nposition, and when some -- when -- when Congress and the\nagency act to displace Federal law and put in place -\nto displace Federal common law and put in place Federal\nregulatory law, that's when the displacement occurs. So\nwhen -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is\nyour test for displacement? When do we tell whether\nthere's displacement or not? Has there been some\ndisplacement in this case but just not total\ndisplacement or -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There's been displacement as\nto automobiles. The EPA made a considered judgment\nabout emissions of carbon dioxide with respect to light\nmotor vehicles. The EPA has made no judgment with\nrespect to stationary sources.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What if the EPA made a\njudgment, but it just was not the judgment that you\nliked? Suppose that the EPA said: We've looked at\nstationary sources; we're not going to regulate. Would\nthat displace?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think if it were a\njudgment that the amount of carbon dioxide emission from\nstationary sources that was currently happening was\nthe -- was the correct amount, that would displace. If\nthe -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds like -\nthat sounds like preemption to me and not displacement,\nor at least preemption with another label.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, of course, there are\nsome similarities between the two. In each case we're\ntalking about whether Federal -- whether one law\nsubstitutes for another, whether one law ousts another.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe you can\ntell me in what -- to what extent displacement is\ndifferent from preemption. Tell me in this area you're\ngoing to have displacement but not preemption. Or I\nguess it's the other way around, in which there's going\nto be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference?\nYou said in response to Justice Kagan that\nif they've made a considered decision that this is the\namount and no other amount higher or lower, then there\nwould be displacement. In what way is that different\nfrom preemption?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the difference isn't\non that front. The difference is that with respect to\npreemption Congress has to decide that it does -- that\nit wishes to override State law expressly. Here what\nwe're talking about is simply whether Congress or the\nagency has acted. It's a little different. They don't\nhave to have in mind Federal common law. They simply\nhave to act in a way that over -- that -- that\nsubstitutes for Federal common law, because the promise\nof the republic really for the States was that the\nStates would have a Federal law applicable to their\ninterstate pollution disputes, and until -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: -- there's a new one, they\nhave the old one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that they\nhave to have in mind State law for preemption, either.\nIf indeed the State law just positively conflicts with a\nFederal statute, it doesn't matter whether Congress had\nState law in mind, does it? I don't know -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, but -- perhaps not. But\nwe -- we talk about, though, whether there was intent -\nthat -- that preemption is ultimately a matter of\ncongressional intent and whether Congress intended\nand -- and preemption should not be lightly inferred.\nIt's probably the case that preemption should be harder\nto find in a close case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't told us\nhow. It -- it -- it's certainly not harder to find\nbecause for preemption you require congressional intent,\nwhereas here -- whereas for displacement you don't.\nThat's not the -- that's not the difference. What -\nwhat is the difference?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think in this\ncontext they probably work pretty similarly. I would\njust say that in each case the question is, what is\nthe -- what does the new law do with respect to the law\nthat it is said to replace? And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're right\nthat under your theory they operate pretty similarly and\nI thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was\nthat they are two very distinct propositions.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, they have different\nreasons for existing, that's certainly what Milwaukee v.\nIllinois said. That doesn't mean they have to in every\ninstance operate differently. The point of preemption\nis about the Federal-State balance, and displacement is\nsimply -- is about separation of powers and the\ninteraction of various agencies within the Federal\nGovernment. It shouldn't be surprising -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your point is that EPA,\nunless and until EPA gets to the point of setting\nstandards for existing sources, the court can be side by\nside with the agency; we know that the agency is\nbeginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then\nit's moving forward. But you say as long as the EPA\nhasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be\nconducting a similar function with -- one of many\ndifferences is that if the EPA is setting the standards\nthey will set -- they will do it through notice and\ncomment, everybody will be able to put in a submission;\nbut the court substituting for the EPA, how does the\ncourt replicate that notice and comment process?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, you say the court\nsubstituting for the EPA. It would be the EPA\nsubstituting for the court. That is, the default, the\nbeginning position before there was legislation, before\nthere was an agency, was a common law remedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there is an\nagency, and we know that it operates in a certain way,\nthrough notice and comment rulemaking.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And here is the court and\nhow does it operate to get to those standards?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, TVA suggests that\nthere's an inexorable march, that there's a regulatory\nprogram underway. But what they point to is an\nagreement by EPA to begin considering whether to\nregulate new and existing power plants. That can't be\nenough. The Federal common law exists for the purpose\nof giving States a remedy for interstate pollution, and\nif it's displaced when -- when the EPA begins thinking\nabout it, then EPA could think about it for a long time.\nThey've said when they hope to complete this rulemaking,\nbut it is not uncommon for delays to -- to enter into\nsuch processes, and it could be a long time before EPA\nactually arrives at a judgment. A lot can happen to\ndelay or derail the fulfillment of a promise.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, do you think that\nyou have a Federal common law cause of action against\nanybody in the world? Your briefs talk a lot about how\nthese are the five largest emissions producers, but I\nsaw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five.\nIs there something that you think limits it to large\nemissions producers rather than anybody in the world?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. I think limitations, a\nlimitation to substantial sources -- and I'll talk in a\nminute about what that might mean -- comes from the\nRestatement definition, from garden variety State cases\nabout -- involving nuisance, and also perhaps from the\nrequirements of standing itself.\nThis case asks the Court to recognize that\nthe States can sue the largest emitters of carbon\ndioxide. These defendants produce 650 million tons a\nyear or 10 percent of U.S. emissions, and individually\nthey produce amounts ranging from 1 to 3 and a half\npercent of U.S. emissions. There is no other company\nthat comes close except perhaps for a handful of the\nnext largest power companies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're lumping\nthem all together. Suppose you lump together all the\ncows in the country. Would -- would that allow you to\nsue all those farmers? I mean, don't you have to do it\ndefendant by defendant?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Courts sometimes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Cow by cow, or at least\nfarm by farm?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Courts sometimes aggregate\njoint contributors to pollution, particularly where the\nremedy that's sought is injunctive relief. If this were\na damage action there would be a different problem of\nallocating to each individual defendant. But the relief\nthat's sought here is the same injunction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you can lump everybody\ntogether, so you can lump together all the people in the\nUnited States -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- who breathe, I suppose.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. I think that breathers\nare not really -- for one thing, they don't even really\ncontribute carbon dioxide because they absorb as well as\n-- as exhale it. For another thing, there's no way that\nbreathing -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. All -- all\nhomes -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: -- could be found\nunreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- all homes that -- that\nemit carbon dioxide in their -- in their heating\nsystems.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, we're talking -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The whole country, and you\nlump them all together, and -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you say that, you know,\nthat equals 10 percent or whatever. Does that give you\na basis?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It is not necessary to\naggregate to have these five defendants stand apart from\neverybody else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then don't give us a\n10 percent figure.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give us the, you know, the\nmaximum figure for a single one of them.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: 3 1/2 percent of U.S.\nemissions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why do you\nstop at U.S. emissions? What percentage of worldwide\nemissions, every one of which I assume harms your\nclients, do these five power plants represent?\nInfinitesimal, right?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Not infinitesimal, actually.\nI believe that U.S. emissions are a quarter of world\nemissions, so you would divide these numbers by four\napproximately.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: From power plants or\ntotal emissions?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Total emissions. And -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And anybody who is a\nsubstantial contributor could be sued?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. And in terms of\ndetermining what -- who is a substantial contributor,\nthere are -- because I do think that at some point a\ncompany's emissions or a cow's would be too small to\ngive rise to a standing or -- to either standing or a\nnuisance claim, and there are various ways to draw the\nlines. It's a familiar task for common law courts to\ndecide how much is substantial, too. But for an\nexample, if the cut-off were producers of 100,000 tons\nper year, as in the EPA tailoring rule for new sources,\njust to take an example, then according to EPA's own\ntechnical data there would be at most a few thousand\npotential defendants.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree --\nGeneral Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic\nfashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case\nwhere the relief, the damages and the relief sought,\nwere as broad as they are here. Do you have anything to\nrebut his proposition? Any case where it has been as\nbroad as it is here?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, of course it depends\non what you call broad. There are -- there are many\ncases, small cases involving an attempt to limit\ndischarges by companies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best -\nwhat's your candidate to rebut his proposition?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A broader case with\nrespect to the infliction of damage and the need for\nrelief.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I guess what I would\nsay is that cases allowing suits against large\ncontributors, with or without others, and dismissing\nagainst small and remote contributors, I give you three\nState cases that are cited in our briefs: A California\ncase about a large mine that was sued for polluting a\nriver when lots of -- lots of others polluted it and\nwere not before the court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not as many as\ncontribute to global warming?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, that's correct. But we\ncould talk about -- if we talk about large contributors\nhere, then we're not talking about so many contributors.\nWe could have it -- we could have it down to, to\nthousands or hundreds or tens, depending on how we\ndefined large.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One aspect of the\nlitigation process as opposed to the agency process, the\nagency makes its rule and that can be challenged in\ncourt, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on\nmerits. I take it this is not a class action, there's\nno certification of any class. Other plaintiffs before\nanother district court could launch a similar action\nagainst these very same defendants, right? There would\nbe nothing to preclude that?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. Well, the parens\npatriae actions by the States might have some\nconsequence for the citizens of those States, but, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That means you have -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There would be others who\nhave -- would have -- who would have the ability, other\nStates, I suppose. I mean, our claim here is that this\nFederal common law nuisance is available first and\nforemost for the States; and the question of whether the\nland trusts or any other private parties could even\nbring it is -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if you won and the\ndistrict court imposed some sort of limit would be there\nany other obstacle to other plaintiffs bringing suits\nand another district court issuing a different standard?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the -- ultimately such\nthings would be resolved by appeal and by -- by the\ncircuit courts. I mean, there are conflicts in many\nareas. That's true about every district court\nlitigation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, it's not,\nand it's not true of every litigation in this sense,\nthat everyone is harmed by global warming. So unless\nyou limit your suits to the States, which would -- I'm\nnot aware of a principled basis for doing that -- every\nindividual can bring -- every individual in the world if\nthey can establish jurisdiction can bring one of these\ncause of -- causes of action.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, a principal basis to\nlimit -- the common -- the Federal common law of\nnuisance, as I said, exists principally for the States,\nfor the reason it survived Erie was the Court spoke of\nthe strong Federal interest in providing the States with\na remedy for interstate pollution. So there is a\nprinciple there.\nAnd then beyond the States, plaintiffs would\nhave to, to bring a common law nuisance claim as well as\nto have standing, would have to have a special injury of\nsome kind that would distinguish them from the\ngeneral -- from the general public. The Land Trusts\nhere argue that they, because they hold their lands in\ntrust for the public, they have special standing.\nThat's -- there's no need to reach that question. This\ncase could turn and should turn on the right of the\nStates to protect their people from -- and their -- and\ntheir land from -- from interstate -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, much of your\nargument depends on this notion that this suit is really\nlike any other pollution suit, but all those other\npollution suits that you've been talking about are much\nmore localized affairs. One factory emitting discharge\ninto one stream. They don't involve these kinds of\nnational/international policy issues of the kind that\nthis case does. I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm\nbetween the precedents you have and this case, isn't\nthere?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know if I would call\nit a chasm, but there's a large distance between them,\nand -- but I would like to separate two things. The\ninternational aspects of this are simply, I think,\nbeyond -- we're not suggesting that this -- this -- that\nthe Federal common law of nuisance entails relief\nagainst international defendants. It does exist for\ninterstate -- for conflicts between the States\nessentially. So I would like to put those aside.\nAnd then, in terms of the magnitude, well,\nthere are many cases, not just one factory, the\nMilwaukee v. Illinois itself involved not just the\nMilwaukee sewage district that -- that was sued, but\nthere were many other contributors to pollution in that\nlake.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In setting these standards,\nthere would somebody difficult trade-offs, wouldn't\nthere? Could you just explain in concrete terms how a\ndistrict judge would deal with those? Let -- and just\ndetermining the facts is going to be hard enough, but\nlet's assume all the facts are proven, there's not a\ndispute about the facts. So that if a certain reduction\nin greenhouse gas emissions is ordered, that will have\nthis effect, it will increase the cost of electricity by\na certain amount, and that will produce certain effects.\nIt will result in the loss of a certain number of jobs,\nit will mean that consumers will have less money to\nspend on other -- other things. Some people will not be\nable to have air conditioning in the summer. That will\nhave health effects.\nHow is the district judge -- what standard\ndoes the district judge have to decide those? It's\njust -- what is it, just what's reasonable?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, reasonableness is the\nbeginning. I -- I've suggested already first that we've\nalleged that this can be done without increasing the\ncost to the consumers. That may seem -- that -- that is\na subject for proof.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Implausible -- implausible\nis the word you're looking for.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, Justice Scalia.\nBut a very good place to look is what other\ncompanies have been able to do or have done, including,\nas I suggested, in Tennessee Copper and perhaps in this\narea as well, companies that settle this litigation or\ncompanies that don't litigate but instead do adopt\nmeasures that haven't been widely adopted. There -\nthere is a practice to examine in the world about what's\nfeasible and what's cost-effective, and that's not\ndifferent from -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suppose\ncost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but\nyou alleged, what I get from reading these might be the\nbest way to deal with the problem. I would like the\ncourt to impose a tax of $20 a ton on carbon, right?\nAnd we bring all the polluters in, and the same injury\nthat you have, everything's the same, you have 14\nexperts who say this is how to get it done. It's\ncost-effective, it will lead to substitution, it will\nactually bring about a world without global warming, and\nso let's do it.\nNow, does the district judge, in your\nopinion, have the power to enter that order?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, now next\nquestion is going to be, if he does not have the power\nto enter that order, which could be proved to be\nextremely effective, and least possible harm to the\nconsumer, why does he have the power to enter the order\nyou want?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Because the common law of\nnuisance is addressed to direct the polluter to abate\nthe nuisance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, this will. This is\naddressed to that. It says abate the nuisance, here's\nhow you're going to do it. You're going to put a $20 a\ntax ton on carbon, and lo and behold, you will discover\nthat nuisance will be abated. And we bring in 15\neconomists.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Actually, the order we're\nasking for is less intrusive than that. We ask the\ndefendants to abate the nuisance, we ask the court to\norder them to abate the nuisance by some amount,\ninformed by what information is available about methods.\nAnd then -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is it less\nintrusive -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to try to get into the\ndetails of how an electricity company will in fact run\nits operation, than to say all you have to do is make a\nchange in the dollar sign that you charge for your\nproduct?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, because we're not\nsuggesting that the court would get into the details on\nour theory, either. It would be the defendants that\nwould get into the details, that would figure out for\nthemselves what the best way was to meet these standards\n-- to meet the objective.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish Justice Breyer had\nmade this argument in the EPA case. I don't think the\nEPA case -\n(Laughter.)\nMS. UNDERWOOD: And of course it's true that\nif you conclude that the Federal statutes displace the\nFederal -- and the Federal regulations displace the\nFederal common law either now or in the future, then\nunder Ouellette, the same Federal statute that replaces\nFederal common law will revive source State common law,\nbecause of the savings clause in that statute, because\nof a choice Congress made; and that result, while less\n-- less respectful of the Federal interest in providing\nFederal law to govern these disputes, would nevertheless\nleave common law courts in the business that they're -\nof attempting to address pollution problems.\nThe suggestion has been made that the EPA\nhas entered the field of greenhouse gas, and that's\nenough, but it isn't just one field. It only seems like\none because the EPA once said the whole subject was off\nlimits and beyond their jurisdiction. Once that\nobstacle is removed, there still remain a series of\nprograms under the statute, a series of kinds of sources\nthat need to be regulated. The Clean Air Act regulates\nby substance and by source. It's a collection of\nstatutory programs, and taking action under one program\ncan't displace the common law as it applies to matters\noutside that program.\nIt may well be that there will be a\nregulation soon that displaces, but it would be very\nsurprising if this Court concluded that the promise of\nregulation is enough to displace the Federal common law\nas distinguished from the actuality of it.\nThe Court has suggested that a court might\nimpose standards that would conflict with what the EPA\nis doing, but there's really no reason to think that\nwould happen because if what a court sets out to do is\nfind out what feasible methods there are for reduction\nand then order the defendants to make reductions that\nare feasible, that's a much less taxing inquiry, a much\nless demanding inquiry than the EPA is likely ultimately\nto make.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the EPA comes up\nwith a different number? Would it -- than the one you\nachieve in this litigation; would the EPA prevail?\nWould the EPA's number prevail or your number prevail?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: You mean an emission\nreduction?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes. I mean you -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: If the EPA -- when the EPA\nspeaks, the EPA's rule will displace the Federal common\nlaw. We're talking entirely -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And will displace the\njudgment that has been obtained under Federal law?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: If -- it would presumably\nprovide a basis for the defendant to go back to the\ncourt and -- and vacate the judgment or alter the\njudgment to comply with regulations, should that happen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And the court says\nno?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's what appellate courts\nare here for, isn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, just\nto follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing? Is\nit reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the\ncontinuing validity of the injunction it entered\npreviously?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The continuing validity of\nthe injunction it entered previously because once the\nEPA -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to be\na displacement of the normal process of administrative\nlaw, which we would review the agency's determination of\nhow best and to what extent to regulate the emissions.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: On a different litigation\ntrack, it is -- would also be possible to challenge the\nEPA's regulatory judgment, but in the case in which a\njudgment had already been entered, it is the ordinary\nlitigation track to, if -- if intervening events make\nequitable relief no longer equitable, to go back to the\ncourt and ask the court to modify its injunction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. And I guess\nthat's the central problem. Once you turn it over to\nlitigation, it's an entirely different set of standards\nthat would regulate emissions as opposed to the\nstandards that would apply with respect to an agency's\ndetermination.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's a\ndifferent set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing\nan agency's determination, but the ultimate standards\nthat are reached are going to be a level of emission\nreduction through either process.\nWhen the agency speaks to the question, the\nFederal common law is displaced. When it doesn't, and\nduring what could be a long period of time when it\ndoesn't, the States are entitled to a Federal law\ngoverning their dispute. So we urge this Court to keep\nthe Federal courts open to States exercising their\nhistoric power to protect their land and their citizens\nfrom air pollution emitted in other States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nUnderwood.\nMr. Keisler, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KEISLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust a few points.\nFirst, with respect to the merits and what\nit would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan,\nit is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so\nfraught and difficult in international negotiations and\nat the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's\nbecause it requires policymakers to allocate burdens\namong critical social goods in favor of important\nenvironmental considerations; and the remedies that are\nbeing considered are potentially transformative because\nthey involve the way we use and supply and pay for\nenergy. And the problems with courts attempting to\nreplicate what's going on in those venues are not simply\nthe matter is complex, although of course it's extremely\ncomplex, but there is no legal principle here to guide\nthe decision. It's a question of trade-offs, how the\ncountry wants to balance the projected environmental\nrisks and benefits against the projected economic\nbenefits and costs.\nIf Congress enacts a statute providing a\nstandard, then our political question argument goes\naway. It's not that this is permanently off limits to\nthe judiciary. It's that it requires a standard. And\nin a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often\ncreate an orderly framework for consideration within a\nstatutory context, which it has done in part by enacting\nthe Clean Air Act.\nAnd the final point I would make my friend\nand I come at this really from opposite angles, in the\nfollowing sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this\nis a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a\nvery strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't\npossibly present justiciability problems, under\nstanding, political question doctrines; and we say that\nthe very powerful standing and political question\nobstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this\nare a signal that this is nothing like the historical\ncause of action that they've relied on.\nTo classify climate change as a tort would\ntrigger a massive shift of institutional authority away\nfrom the politically accountable branches and to the\ncourts, which we think would be inconsistent with\nseparation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that\nthe Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case\nbe dismissed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
