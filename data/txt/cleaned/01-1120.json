        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nNumber 01-1120, Meyer against Holley.\nMr. Benedon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. BENEDON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BENEDON: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe question -- excuse me. The question\npresented should be answered with the following bright\nline rule: Imposition of vicarious liability under the\nFHA should be determined by application of established\nrules of corporate and agency law not criteria unique to\nthe FHA.\nand officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of\nthe other agents of the corporation.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that a different rule\nshould apply under the FHA, that vicarious liability could\nbe based on control alone. That is not, nor should it be,\nthe law.\nWhile the starting -- the starting point for the\nanalysis is necessarily the statute itself, while Congress\nhas authority to expand the class of persons liable for\nviolation of a Federal law, when it has done so, it has\ndone so expressly. The FHA was never -- which neither\ndefines nor expands the class of persons liable under the\nact, and as this Court stated in Bestfoods, this silence\nis dispositive.\nSpecifically, Congress has spoken directly when\nit has wished to impose a control test. For example --\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose that I were to\nagree with you and the Court were to agree with you as to\nyour criticism of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and -- and\nthat it agreed with you too that general principles of\nagency and corporate liability apply. Based on this\nrecord, could we go on to say that under California law\nand real estate law generally, the real estate salesman is\nthe agent of the broker, and therefore the broker is\nliable under agency law?\nMR. BENEDON: The answer --\nQUESTION: Or -- or would I have to -- would we\nhave to remand before we did that? Because this is\ndiscussed in the -- in the respondents' brief, and the\nrespondent makes it quite clear. And maybe you disagree,\nbut the -- the law is cited on page 15 of the red brief,\nthat under California law, the broker is the principal.\nAnd I take it the principal would be liable under\nrespondeat superior in this case.\nMR. BENEDON: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If -- if we find who the principal\nis, we know the principal is going to be liable.\nMR. BENEDON: That's where --\nQUESTION: Under California law the broker is\nthe principal.\nMR. BENEDON: My -- Your Honor, my answer to\nthat is -- is several-fold.\nFirst, the distinction needs to be made between\na corporate broker and an individual broker. Mr. Meyer in\nthis case is a corporate officer who holds a broker's\nlicense solely as the officer of the corporation. The\ncorporation is the employer of the agent. The agent\noperates under the license held by the corporation.\nQUESTION: But isn't it fair to say that -- or\nisn't it?\ncorporation operates as a broker only because it has the\nindividual's broker license assigned to it.\nMR. BENEDON: It has to, Your Honor.\nA corporation as a paper person needs human beings to\nfulfill the function that a corporation must do, as does\nany corporation. There will always be supervising\nofficers --\nQUESTION: Is -- is there any California law\nsaying that -- that the corporation is the principal in a\nsituation like this and not the holder of the -- not\nthe -- not the named broker?\nMR. BENEDON: The named broker, again -- to\nanswer your question, no, not that I'm aware of.\nQUESTION: This -- this is a --\nQUESTION: Let me ask the opposite. Is there\nany California case in which the named broker in the\ncorporation has been held liable as the principal solely\nbecause he's the named broker?\nMR. BENEDON: Not the designated officer, Your\nHonor. The corporation has been held liable.\nQUESTION: Yes. That's what I'm talking about.\nMR. BENEDON: But not the designated\nofficer/broker.\nQUESTION: So --\nQUESTION:\nlicenses, the individual license that Justice Kennedy was\nreferring to and that's mentioned on page 15 of the red\nbrief, the individual broker license and the statement\nthat the individual broker licensee is vicariously\nliable and the broker who holds the license under the\ncorporate name? Are those different certificates?\nMR. BENEDON: Absolutely, Your Honor. There are\nseparate licenses issued by the Department of Real Estate\nin California: one to individuals who act as brokers, and\none to individuals who are brokers only in their capacity\nas officers of a corporation. Those are separate\nlicenses.\nThe only license in this cases was held by\nMr. Meyer as an officer of the corporation. He could not\nstep outside the corporation and act as a broker. His\nexistence as a broker depended on the corporation. He\ncould not transact --\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question? You\nexplained to Justice Scalia that there is no California\ncase holding a corporate broker liable in this situation,\nas I understand. Are there any California cases going the\nother way? Has it ever -- has the issue ever been\npresented to the California courts?\nMR. BENEDON: Yes, it has, Your Honor. In two\ncases, there have been, one -- one State case and one\ndistrict court case cited in our -- in our briefs, in\nthe -- re Grabau case. They've held that the California\nstatutory scheme imposes only a disciplinary remedy for\nany violations of the scheme such that a broker -- a\ndesignated officer/broker who violates any of the\nprovisions of the statute may be subject to discipline,\nbut is not the basis of a civil action.\nQUESTION: So in this case the individual could\nbe subject to discipline, but not to liability. Is\nthat --\nMR. BENEDON: Correct.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: What were your other reasons. You\nsaid you -- you had a multi-faceted answer, or something\nlike that. What -- what are the other --\nMR. BENEDON: The --\nQUESTION: -- prongs or the other facets of your\nanswer?\nMR. BENEDON: The other facets is that liability\nunder the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law.\nThere, the -- the agency under the FHA is determined on\nFederal rules of agency. To determine Federal agency,\nthis Court held in General Contractors, you look to the\nRestatement which has a two-prong test. One is the right\nof control, but the other is that the person controlled\nhas to be acting on behalf of the principal.\nHere, the agent works -- is working on behalf of\nthe corporation. In this case when Mr. Crank went out and\ndid real estate transactions, he was acting on behalf of\nTriad. He was not acting on behalf of Meyer.\nThe problem with looking at each State's\nstructure is we're going to end up with a patchwork\nconstruction of a Federal statute. The law may be\ndifferent in Nevada than from Oregon than from Washington\nthan from West Virginia.\nQUESTION: Is that --\nQUESTION: Suppose it were the majority rule\nthat a real estate broker is the principal for the\nsalesman. Would we follow that rule generally?\nMR. BENEDON: Again, Your Honor, the --\nQUESTION: And again, I'm -- I'm referring to\nthe red brief at pages 14 and 15 which sets this -- this\nout. You say there's a distinction because there's a\ncorporate broker and -- and an individual broker.\nMR. BENEDON: Correct.\nQUESTION: Now, we -- I -- we can explore that a\nlittle bit. But suppose it were the -- the general rule\nin most of the States that had addressed the subject that\nthe broker is the principal.\nMR. BENEDON:\nyou still need to make a distinction between individual\nbrokers and corporate licensed brokers. We do not dispute\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I was simply addressing\nthe point of whether or not State law as opposed to\nFederal law controls. And if it's the general law in most\nStates that the broker is the principal, then that would\ncertainly be sufficient for the imposition of liability\nunder this Federal scheme. Would it not?\nMR. BENEDON: Again, I -- I disagree, Your\nHonor. I would say that the rules still -- you need to\nstill look at the Federal law of agency rather than how\nthe State defines the relationship between the broker and\nthe agent. You -- again, you look to the Federal rules of\nagency to determine agency under the FHA.\nQUESTION: I thought you said those were general\ncommon law principles that are -- presumably the States\nwould share.\nMR. BENEDON: The general law principles applied\nin the broker/agent context would establish that the\nagent -- the sales agent -- is the agent of the principal\nbroker when the broker is acting in his individual\ncapacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the\nprincipal, of the individual broker, and subject to that\nbroker's control.\nofficer/broker who is not -- the agent in that situation\nis not acting on behalf of the officer. He's acting on\nbehalf of the corporation.\nQUESTION: Then if I understand your argument\ncorrectly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's\nCalifornia law or Federal common law, is in this case at\nleast academic because under California law, if you were\nto apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that\nthe only remedy where it's -- the license is held in the\ncorporate name is a disciplinary sanction?\nMR. BENEDON: To date, that is how California\nhas treated violations of the California statutory scheme.\nCorrect, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Only -- only by these corporate\nbrokers or -- or by -- by individual brokers?\nMR. BENEDON: Excuse me, Your Honor. Individual\nbrokers as well.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BENEDON: It's a statutory scheme that\napplies to brokers in general and salespersons in general\nwho -- who allegedly violate the act.\nQUESTION: But I thought you said that if -- if\nthis were a license to an individual broker, if this were\nheld -- the license were held by Meyer as an individual --\nthat he would then have a principal agent relationship\nwith Crank. Is that not so?\nMR. BENEDON: That is correct, Your Honor, if\nit's an individual broker's license.\nI think I may have caused some confusion. Under\ngeneral principles of agency law, common law principles of\nagency law, the sales agent is in an agent principal\nrelationship with an individual broker. If there is a\nviolation of the act by the broker under California law,\nthen he would be subject to disciplinary action. That is\nseparate and apart from vicarious liability under the FHA,\nwhich would adhere based on the principal agent\nrelationship.\nQUESTION: Is there an issue in this case about\npiercing the corporate veil as a means of holding Meyer\nliable?\nMR. BENEDON: Not in this case, Your Honor. We\nhold that the theory and doctrine of corporate veil-\npiercing is -- is available in the appropriate case as it\nwould be under any case under the general common law,\nalthough here it's been -- it wasn't raised and it's been\nwaived, and it's never been proven.\nQUESTION: But they came --\nQUESTION: Was there some reference to\nveil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth\nCircuit?\nMR. BENEDON: On the last page of argument in a\nfootnote, Your Honor, there's a reference arguing that\nbased on sole ownership, that they could establish an\nalter ego, but as a matter of law, that's insufficient to\nestablish alter ego.\nQUESTION: Well, didn't -- refresh my\nrecollection. Doesn't this come up on a motion for\nsummary judgment?\nMR. BENEDON: First a motion to dismiss, Your\nHonor --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BENEDON: -- followed by a --\nQUESTION: Which was denied and then there was a\nmotion for summary judgment.\nMR. BENEDON: The motion for dismiss was granted\nin part, Your Honor, as to all the State law claims --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BENEDON: -- the 1981 claim, and it\nproceeded just on the FHA claim.\nQUESTION: Right. Now, so if it came up on a\nmotion for summary judgment, then whatever -- whatever\nevidence the plaintiffs were going to rely on for the\nveil-piercing would have had to have been brought forward.\nIsn't that right?\nMR. BENEDON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And what did they bring forward?\nMR. BENEDON: Nothing, except sole ownership.\nQUESTION: Sole ownership is the only thing --\nMR. BENEDON: Which is in dispute. Which is in\ndispute. We maintain that ownership was, in fact,\ntransferred, but we are assuming for the purpose of this\nproceeding that there is in fact ownership resided in\nMr. Meyer.\nQUESTION: I thought that if -- that a judgment\nwinner, as the Holleys are at this stage, can defend the\njudgment on another ground. In other words, the Ninth\nCircuit ruled in their favor and now they're saying, well,\nhere's another theory on which we could prevail. I didn't\nknow -- certainly they can't get an immediate victory, but\nif they attempt to defend the judgment on that basis,\naren't they then entitled to go back and make the case\nrather than taking from them their victory and saying you\nlose? They say, but we have another theory that would be\nviable. Up till now, we won with this one. Why isn't\nthat altogether appropriate they should now be given a\nchance to air that other theory in support of the\njudgment?\nMR. BENEDON: They -- the theory was never\nraised below. An alter ego is in and of itself a fact-\ndriven inquiry.\nwasn't raised below, it's -- it's now been waived. It\ncan't be raised for the first time in this Court.\nQUESTION: Even if -- even if it had been\nraised, my understanding is in -- in order to have it sent\nback on the -- on the basis that although the court below\nrelied on one theory, it could have relied on the other,\nthe motion for summary judgment put the plaintiff to his\nproof to -- to at least come up with facts, the assertion\nof facts, not the demonstration of them, but the assertion\nof facts that would support the other theory. And the\nonly fact contained here is control. So if control is --\ndoes not suffice to pierce veils, that's the end of the\ncase, it seems to me.\nMR. BENEDON: That's correct. That is correct\nand that is our position.\nQUESTION: I thought there were a bunch of\nthings. I mean, the Government in its brief lists a whole\nbunch of things. He was the sole shareholder. He was the\npresident. He did control it. He paid the taxes in his\nown Social Security number. He made various transactions\nthat violated the terms under which it was supposed to be\nthe corporate form, and he didn't train the person\nproperly. I mean, they have a list of things which I take\nit they didn't just make up, that they're there in the\nrecord.\nThen -- and then they say that, well, in the\nNinth Circuit brief, what it says in the footnote is that\nevidence -- evidence will show that Meyer is the sole\nshareholder of Triad, and thus an argument to pierce the\ncorporate veil would be meritorious. Well, they don't\nlist all those things in that footnote. That's true. But\nwe should send it back and let the Ninth Circuit decide.\nI guess that's basically their argument, and I\nthink I want to hear as complete a response to that as --\nas you have. Maybe I've heard it already.\nMR. BENEDON: No. You -- I would like to\namplify on that, Your Honor.\nThe issue of -- of alter ego that's been now\nraised for the first time in this -- in this Court by the\nSolicitor General is based on speculation beyond the\nshowing that there was sole ownership and that there is no\ninsurance coverage. Everything else is unsupported by the\nrecord in terms of establishing that there was a failure\nto adhere to corporate formalities, that there was under-\ncapitalization. All that is speculation. And the\nargument boils down --\nQUESTION: Was it not even asserted? I mean --\nMR. BENEDON: No.\nQUESTION: -- to survive the motion for summary\njudgment, you don't have to prove it, but you have to say\nI -- you know, I will prove it.\nMR. BENEDON: No, it wasn't --\nQUESTION: It wasn't even asserted.\nMR. BENEDON: It was not even asserted. It's\nasserted for the first time in this Court.\nQUESTION: Well, in the footnote -- they mention\nit in the footnote.\nMR. BENEDON: They mention sole ownership in the\nfootnote.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's -- you're\nquite right.\nMR. BENEDON: Yes. And for example, the --\nYour -- Your Honor made reference to payment of taxes.\nWhile that was alleged, it was never proven at the summary\njudgment stage. That's just an allegation in their --\nQUESTION: I don't know what that means. While\nit was alleged, it was never proven at the summary\njudgment stage.\nMR. BENEDON: Right. There's --\nQUESTION: There -- there was no evidence\nbrought in at all to establish it.\nMR. BENEDON: That he -- that taxes were paid\nunder his ID? None whatsoever.\nQUESTION: Well, was -- was there an affidavit\non their side claiming that?\nMR. BENEDON: On the other side claiming that?\nQUESTION: Yes. How did it get raised?\nMR. BENEDON: It was raised solely as a -- as an\nallegation in the complaint. And then when it came time\nfor them to put their proof on the table, it wasn't there.\nQUESTION: So at the summary judgment stage,\nthey didn't rely on that is what you're saying.\nMR. BENEDON: Correct.\nQUESTION: They didn't. Okay.\nMR. BENEDON: Correct.\nQUESTION: And did you deny it?\nMR. BENEDON: Absolutely. Absolutely. But\nagain, it was not raised as a disputed material fact on\nthe summary judgment, so there's no formal denial in the\nrecord because it was never raised. I'm denying it now.\nQUESTION: And you said there was no genuine\nissue -- no triable issue at the summary judgment stage,\nthat there were no facts?\nMR. BENEDON: That there was no issue regarding\npayment of taxes under Mr. Meyer's personal ID number.\nQUESTION: Well, if the question is the -- the\nliability of Mr. Meyer -- and at the summary judgment\nstage, it's not a trial. You don't prove your case at\nthat point. It's only if there's no genuine triable\nissue.\nMR. BENEDON: Right. The only issue on the\nsummary judgment was whether or not Mr. Meyer was still\nthe owner of Triad Corporation. The district court found\nnot. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that there\nwas a disputed issue on sole ownership.\nQUESTION: But what was the relevance of whether\nhe was the owner or not? I don't quite understand.\nMR. BENEDON: They're claiming that that was\nsufficient to establish alter ego, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Alter ego, but not piercing the\ncorporate veil, is that --\nMR. BENEDON: Well, I'm using those\ninterchangeably. I apologize.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I didn't understand you.\nMR. BENEDON: I use those interchangeably.\nThey -- both alter ego as a basis for piercing the\ncorporate veil. They were arguing -- and in fact, the\nNinth Circuit held -- that sole ownership of the\ncorporation was enough to pierce the corporate veil.\nQUESTION: They were arguing that. So they were\narguing the pierce the corporate veil theory then.\nMR. BENEDON: No. They -- solely based on sole\nownership. Correct.\nQUESTION: But the -- but the purpose of\ninvestigating the sole ownership issue was to determine\nwhether or not they could pierce the corporate veil. Is\nthat right?\nMR. BENEDON: Based --\nQUESTION: Which seems to me as though their\nissue of whether they could pierce the corporate veil was\nat least raised, and the question is whether their claim\nof sole ownership was sufficient to establish that point.\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding something.\nMR. BENEDON: Right. Well, that -- that's the\nargument that's made in their footnote on the last page of\ntheir brief is that sole ownership would establish an\nalter ego sufficient to pierce the corporate veil. And as\na matter of law, that's -- that is insufficient.\nQUESTION: But -- but now I'm just a little\npuzzled about the extent to which it was raised in the\ndistrict court. Was there a debate on the -- in the\ndistrict court as to whether your client was the sole\nowner or not?\nMR. BENEDON: Yes, there was.\nQUESTION: And what was the purpose of that\ndebate in the district court? Wasn't it for the very same\nreason?\nMR. BENEDON: They were trying to -- no, I\ndisagree. I think what they were trying to establish in\nthe district court was the -- the control exerted by my\nclient over the corporation as opposed to saying that he\nshould be necessarily a veil-piercing --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe I -- I don't remember the\nfacts correctly. But I thought that control was really\nnot in dispute. I thought that the -- the person to whom\nhe transferred stock didn't get all the stock, did he, or\ndid he get just some of the stock?\nMR. BENEDON: He got some of the stock, but\nownership --\nQUESTION: So he still would have had control.\nMR. BENEDON: He would have partial control as\na -- as a shareholder.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. BENEDON: But the -- the Ninth Circuit held\nthat that was enough. The court -- the Ninth Circuit --\nQUESTION: Not -- not that it was enough for\npiercing the veil, but that it was enough for what?\nMR. BENEDON: It was enough to impose personal\nliability.\nQUESTION: On what basis? Not on\nveil-piercing --\nMR. BENEDON: No.\nQUESTION: -- basis.\nMR. BENEDON: Solely on sole ownership. They --\nthe Ninth Circuit, taking a -- its lead from, I believe,\nthe Seventh Circuit, said basically that in a situation\nlike this where you have sole ownership, under the FHA\nthat's enough to impose --\nQUESTION: Okay. You don't have to pierce the\nveil.\nMR. BENEDON: Correct. It's -- it's an almost\nper se piercing based on sole ownership.\nQUESTION: But just returning one -- once again\nto the broker problem. I'm looking at Gipson versus Davis\nRealty, which is a case by Judge -- written by Judge\nMolinari. It's cited on page 15 of the respondents'\nbrief. That was a standard respondeat superior case where\nthe broker -- pardon me -- where the salesman is in an\nautomobile accident and they seek to hold the principal\nfor the damages caused by the accident within the course\nof his employment. And this is the case where the\nstatement is made that the broker is liable for the\nmisconduct or -- or malfeasance of -- of the agent in the\ncourse of -- of his employment.\nAnd it's a case much like this where there's a\ncorporation that holds the license. There -- there\ndoesn't seem to be a -- a distinction between the\ncorporate license and -- and the broker license that you\nmade. Is that -- was the law changed since the Gipson\ncase, or --\nMR. BENEDON: Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor.\nAgain, I -- I don't have the facts of that case\nat -- at the tip of my fingers.\nQUESTION: Well, it was relied on in the\nrespondents' brief.\nMR. BENEDON: Right. But again, in that case I\ndon't recall if it was a corporate broker or whether it\nwas an individual broker. But if it was a corporate\nbroker and they're holding them individually liable for\nthe torts of the --\nQUESTION: Well, as I understand the facts of\nthe case, it was an individual who held the license and he\noperated through a corporation. That's -- that's --\nMR. BENEDON: Well, again, I would say that what\nCalifornia decides to do is not what needs -- can be what\ndetermines under the -- the Federal statute. It's been\nargued by both sides and the case law is consistent that\nit's Federal rules of agency. And under Federal rules of\nagency, the salesperson is the agent of the corporation,\nnot the individual broker.\nIf there are no further questions, I would just\nlike to conclude and save the rest -- the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Schwemm.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. SCHWEMM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SCHWEMM: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'd like to begin by addressing the\nveil-piercing and the preserving issue, particularly with\nrespect to Justice Scalia's question because I disagree\nwith my learned friend on the procedural posture of this\ncase.\nThere was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. In the\ncomplaint at that time, there were essentially two\ntheories. The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be\nliable as an individual because he owned the corporation,\nand the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be\nliable because he was the officer/broker.\nThe district court granted in part, even with\nrespect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion\nand, in particular, held that the allegations of the\ncomplaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances\ncould lead to liability. And the only thing that the\ndistrict court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue\nwith respect to liability based on officer/broker.\nThat led to discovery. The district court then\ngranted summary judgment because it was the district\ncourt's theory on that issue that there could not be\nliability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's\nlicense as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is\na license through Triad, or more properly, according to\nthe California law, Triad holds the license through him.\nSo with all respect, what the district court\nheld in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that\nthe plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing.\nWe never got --\nQUESTION: Well, could prove or -- or claimed\nthey could prove in response to the motion. I mean,\nyou -- you don't have to sit back and say, I wonder what\nthey might be able to prove. You -- you have to have made\nan offer of proof, and -- and what the court held was that\nnone of the facts that you claimed you could prove would\nsuffice. Isn't that an accurate description of -- of\nwhat -- what the holding of the court was?\nMR. SCHWEMM: And the facts that we alleged were\nthat Mr. Meyer was the sole owner of the corporation,\nwhich they denied, and that that was sufficient to impose\nindividual liability. And when the district court granted\n12(b)(6) motion, my understanding of that is that he is\nsaying, under no set of facts will you ever win.\nNow, what would --\nQUESTION: -- isn't that true that -- that you\nhave to have something more than simply a person being a\nsole owner of a corporation? Otherwise a person couldn't\ncreate a corporation with himself as a 100 percent owner.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: All right. So they're -- what\nthey're saying is you didn't allege anything than that,\nand you certainly didn't support anything other than that\nwith affidavits or other -- or other offers of proof.\nMR. SCHWEMM: That's -- that was my point --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SCHWEMM: -- with respect to the summary\njudgment.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, if you -- if you\ndidn't, then you're out of luck, aren't you?\nMR. SCHWEMM: I don't think so because --\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. SCHWEMM: -- at the 12(b)(6) motion stage,\nwe are told that you can't even --\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm not saying 12(b)(6).\nI mean on summary judgment.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Yes. If my learned friend was\nright that this was a summary judgment dismissal of that\nclaim, I might agree. But that's not right.\nWe were stopped at the very pleadings stage. We\nwere prepared to show both of the key factors with respect\nto veil-piercing, which is that the corporation is heavily\nunderfunded. In fact, in a colloquy with the district\ncourt, the defendant's counsel, after the 12(b)(6) motion,\nYour Honor, when the only thing left was the summary\njudgment with respect to the broker situation, the\ndistrict court said, is there any money in the company?\nAnd the defendant's lawyer said, no, there is not.\nQUESTION: Okay. I have your complaint here on\npage 16 and 17 of the joint appendix. First claim, Fair\nHousing Act. I don't see anything there about -- about\nveil-piercing or anything like that. Where -- where is it\nin the complaint?\nMR. SCHWEMM: Correct, Your Honor. The -- the\nphrase veil-piercing is not mentioned --\nQUESTION: No, no. Or anything even vaguely\nlike that. I mean, what it seems to say is that Mr. Meyer\nhimself did all these things, or through his agent. Now,\nthat's -- that's what it says.\nMR. SCHWEMM: The allegation, if I could refer\nYour Honor to page 4 of the joint appendix in paragraph 6\nof the complaint, says that he owned the corporation and\non that basis he's individually liable. And then it goes\non and says he also was the officer/broker of the\ncorporation, which is the other theory --\nQUESTION: Yes, I see where it says he owned the\ncorporation.\ntherefore he is liable because he owned it. I mean, it\njust seems to be the part where you're describing the\nparties.\nMR. SCHWEMM: There is another part, Your Honor.\nPage 7 of the joint appendix, paragraph 13, which carries\nover to page 8. Essentially the same thing. I'm not\nsuggesting that there is additional material there, but\nthere is the allegation of ownership leading to personal\nliability.\nQUESTION: No. I mean -- to be honest with you,\nI'm not -- I'm just debating with myself whether you -- we\nshould send this back to the Ninth Circuit, tell them work\nthis out or not. And district court judges are not\nmind-readers. They -- they can't make up what you're\nsaying in a complaint unless you say it and unless you\nargue it. So -- so that's why I'm pressing you on this.\nI'm -- I'm trying to find the particular point where you\nreally made this point to the district court so the judge\nwould focus on it and make a decision.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Well, I wish it was more detailed,\nYour Honor, but it seems to me it's sufficient for notice\npleading. The district court understood it. The\ndefendants understood it.\nQUESTION: Well, he didn't seem to, in his\nopinion, understand it because the only reference he has\nto veil-piercing seems in a footnote in a paragraph. And\nwhat he seems to be saying there is referring to a\ndifferent argument, the argument that there could be no\nveil-piercing because he didn't even own this corporation.\nAnd he says, that -- that's really wrong. It's not true.\nOr maybe he said it was right, but he was wrong if he said\nit was right.\nMR. SCHWEMM: And that's at the 12(b)(6) stage.\nAnd -- and my understanding of that is he is saying, I'm\nnot going to get you -- let you go forward to your proof\nbecause under no circumstances can there be veil-piercing\nunder the Fair Housing Act, which is just wrong.\nQUESTION: This was at the summary judgment\nstage?\nMR. SCHWEMM: No, sir. On page 32, which is the\ndistrict court's order, page 32 to the joint appendix,\nwhich is the district court's order --\nQUESTION: 32 of the joint appendix.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Yes, Your Honor. It actually\nstarts as an opinion on page 25 of the joint appendix.\nThis is the district court's order granting in part the\n12(b)(6) motion. He doesn't allow going forward at the\n12(b)(6) stage the claim based on ownership. He allows\ngoing forward the claim based on corporate broker, and he\nspecifically refers to a case -- this is the 12(b)(6)\ndecision -- that talks about veil-piercing. Page 32 of\nthe joint appendix in the footnote.\nNow, our point is that that's enough for notice\npleading. The defendants understood what was going on.\nThe judge understood what was going on. We were\nprepared -- certainly at the summary judgment stage,\nJustice Scalia, we would -- we would have been happy to go\nforward with proof of underfunding, and there is\nsubstantial proof of underfunding. We would have been\nhappy to go forward with proof of lack of corporate\nformalities. This is a company --\nQUESTION: Well, had you alleged any of these\nthings? I mean, opposing counsel referred in his argument\nto an allegation that the individual taxpayer ID number\nwas being used. Did you allege that in -- in the\ncomplaint somewhere?\nMR. SCHWEMM: That we did allege.\nQUESTION: Okay. Where is it? I mean, this is\nwhat we're fishing for. Did you allege anything beyond\nthe mere claim of sole ownership?\nMR. SCHWEMM: Page 7 of the joint appendix, Your\nHonor, paragraph 13 toward the bottom of the page. After\nit's been alleged that Triad was owned by Mr. Meyer --\nQUESTION: Yes. I got it.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Got it?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nDid you allege anything -- I mean, okay, we've\ngot sole ownership. We've got taxpayer ID. Did you\nallege anything else that might be a basis for piercing\nthe veil?\nMR. SCHWEMM: We -- we did not allege the\ndetails of that. That is to say, we did not allege\nunderfunding, and we did not allege lack of corporate\nformalities. But it seems to me that's not required under\nConley versus Gibson. There is notice pleading, and then\nwe are put to our proof if that had been permitted to go\nforward to the summary judgment stage.\nQUESTION: You're -- the point you're making is\nthat you are not certainly required under the Federal\nrules to set out your -- any theory of the pleadings. You\njust have to state facts showing that there's a claim for\nrelief.\nMR. SCHWEMM: That's exactly right, Your Honor.\nAnd it seems to me in a case decided by this Court in the\nmid-'90s -- I believe it was Peacock -- the Court said\nveil-piercing is really not a new claim. It is a theory\nof relief. We have claimed Fair Housing Act liability in\nthe complaint based on these --\nQUESTION: Mr. Schwemm, can I ask you this\nquestion?\nMR. SCHWEMM: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- a California question as esoteric\nas this one is. And I'm just wondering, do you defend the\nrationale of the Ninth Circuit and do you defend the -- do\nyou abandon reliance on any Federal defense here?\nMR. SCHWEMM: Our position --\nQUESTION: Or Federal regulation.\nMR. SCHWEMM: -- is that the Ninth Circuit's\njudgment was correct, but it went too far when it reached\nout and said under the Fair Housing Act we have to go\nbeyond traditional principles of agency. We think the\nstandard should be, just as it is under Title VII, the\nemployment discrimination law, in Kolstad, Burlington\nIndustries, and Faragher, that the standard for vicarious\nliability under the Federal statute should be a Federal\nstandard. And that standard should be traditional agency\nprinciples as informed by the policies of the Fair Housing\nAct.\nNow, the Ninth Circuit apparently felt that they\nhad to go beyond traditional agency principles. What\nwe've tried to do in the brief in Roman numerals I, II,\nand III is point out three separate and independent\nalternative theories under traditional agency principles.\nAnd in that sense, we -- we think the Ninth Circuit just\nreached out and tried to do something that wasn't\nnecessary.\nQUESTION: Well, then is your piercing-of-\ncorporate-veil theory a Federal theory or a State law\ntheory?\nMR. SCHWEMM: Our position on that is that it's\nprobably Federal law, but as I read Bestfoods, the Court\nhasn't specifically determined, and if I may say that\nthis -- this is something that I don't have a position on.\nBut either way, we are entitled to a remand whether it's\nFederal or California law. But the cause of action\nclearly is the Fair Housing Act.\nI believe the Government takes the position --\nand we certainly don't disagree with the Government --\nthat it is a Federal question.\nAnd if I may, I want to get into those parts I,\nII, and III of our brief, and particularly the first part\nand vicarious liability.\nThe problem we have with petitioner's argument\nis that I believe it's based on two faulty assumptions.\nOne is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the\nCalifornia corporation and real estate law that are\nadvantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other\npart, which is the responsibility part. It is literally\ntrue that in California, a corporation can be a broker,\nbut it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual\nappointed who is an officer of the corporation and has\nqualified under the broker requirements, and that\nindividual is required by California law to take\nresponsibility for the supervision and control of the\nagency.\nQUESTION: Yes, but your opponent says that\nthe -- the results under California law is he can be\ndisciplined if he fails to do so, but there are no\nCalifornia cases holding him personally liable if he fails\nto do so.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Our position is that that may be\nright, it may be wrong. We believe this is a Federal\nstandard.\nQUESTION: Do you think it's right or wrong?\nMR. SCHWEMM: If we got a remand, Your Honor, we\nwould very much like the opportunity on this basis to\nargue that it's wrong. There is a California case in 1978\nthat holds that, but a year later, California amends its\nlicensing statute to add the very key provision in this\ncase which is 10159.2 which says that the individual who's\nappointed by the corporation as the officer/broker has\npersonal responsibility. So our argument would be on\nremand that that change.\nBut I want to -- I want to make the point\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, can -- can I go back to an\nearlier point you made. You said that California law says\nthat the corporate broker, the -- the one who's designated\nfor the corporation, has to exercise control over the --\nover the brokers in the corporation. That may well be\ntrue.\nThe -- the issue is not whether he -- he has to\nexercise control. It's whether he exercises control in\nhis personal status or rather exercises control as an\nofficer of the corporation. If it's in the latter\ncapacity that he exercises control, he -- he should not\nhave personal liability. It's the corporation that has\nliability.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, as I understand the California\nlaw, this broker could not operate under that license on\nhis own. The only way he could use that license was as an\nofficer of the corporation. Isn't that correct?\nMR. SCHWEMM: I would put it actually a little\ndifferently. If you divide the corporation from\nMr. Meyer, Mr. Meyer can then apply, because he's\nqualified, to become a broker. Currently he would have to\nfile a paper, but he would clearly get the status. But\nTriad, Inc. would cease at that moment being able to be a\nbroker.\nsalesman's acts, could have been performed under the\nrubric of Triad.\nAnd the other point that I was going to make\nabout the petitioner's argument that I think is faulty is\nit's the assumption that if Triad, Inc. is the principal\nof these agents, nobody else can be the principal of these\nagents. And that's clearly inconsistent with longstanding\nagency principles as reflected in the Restatement,\nsection 20, comment f, which says there can be joint\nprincipals.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but -- sure, of course,\nthere can. But -- but it's not -- it's corporation law\nthat -- that the officers of the corporation are not one\nof those other principals.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Ordinarily, Your Honor, but not in\nthis case. I -- I repeat. This company cannot be a\nbroker if it doesn't have a broker-qualified individual\nwho takes responsibility for the agents. And so --\nQUESTION: Do you think the Gipson case that you\ncited in your brief is on all fours with your case?\nMR. SCHWEMM: No, Your Honor, it's not on all\nfours. I believe what it says is if the broker is\noperating as a sole proprietorship, as an individual, he\nclearly is vicariously liable. That is, by the way, what\n86 percent of the brokers in California do. They operate\nas sole proprietors, and they are clearly vicariously\nliable. There is a -- an additional question. What\nhappens when you incorporate? And -- and so it's not\nexactly on all fours.\nAnd I think the -- the jury is out or the judges\nare out with -- with respect to what California would do.\nSome States say in addition to the corporation, the\nindividual is vicariously liable; some don't.\nQUESTION: Well, so that means you can't have a\ncorporation. If -- if you want to run a real estate\ncorporation, you can't do it because there has to be a\nbroker's license, and you're going to be personally\nliable. What's the use of having a corporation then?\nMR. SCHWEMM: There are many uses, Your Honor,\nand I would like to address that.\nThe only thing that we are arguing that\nMr. Meyer was responsible for is what I would call the\nlicensed activities. For example, if a broker went out on\nthe way to a meeting and negligently drove his car and\ncaused an accident, that is not the kind of behavior\nthat's subject to broker supervision. And that would be\nno liability.\nQUESTION: Well, but if he defrauds a client or,\nI mean, anything that's going to involve big money on the\npart of the corporation is going to come back on the head\nof the individual broker. So you're saying if you want to\nbe in the brokerage business, you cannot do it as a\npractical matter in the corporate form.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Only I'm not saying it, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: That's -- well, no. That -- that's\nwhat you say the California law says.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Yes. And every State -- I want to\nmake this point. Every single State says this. 11 States\nsay you can't even operate as a broker as a corporate\nform. 39 States, including California, said we will allow\nyou to do this, but there has to be one human being that\nis responsible.\nAnd in this particular case, there came a point\nwhen Mr. Meyer was trying to get the Triad license\nextended. California said you haven't satisfied that\nbecause you personally, Meyer, haven't engaged in the\ncontinuing education requirements that an officer/broker\nis required --\nQUESTION: That's even tougher than -- than what\nmost States provide for lawyers.\nMR. SCHWEMM: It's very analogous to lawyers,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: No. It isn't analogous at all.\nLawyers -- lawyers can -- can avoid personal liability.\nQUESTION: California doesn't give personal\nliability there, does it? I mean, my statute here says\nthere's an officer who's designated by a corporate broker\nlicense, and that officer is responsible for supervision\nand control of activities conducted on behalf of the\ncorporation. So that suggests that he's conducting that\nsupervision on behalf of the corporation, and so it's the\ncorporation that would respond in -- in -- under the\nprinciple of respondeat superior.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Let me --\nQUESTION: Evidently that's what California has\nheld, and given the wording, it seems reasonable.\nMR. SCHWEMM: Well, it held that and then\nCalifornia's legislature came along and added -- added the\nrequirements.\nBut let me -- let me make this observation:\nWhen Mr. Crank, the salesperson in this case, wanted to\nextend his salesperson's license, he was required to have\nhis broker authorize the forms. This was done four times\nby Mr. Meyer. If you look at the form -- joint appendix\nlodging 75 is the most recent example, but there are three\nother examples -- the California form says, list the\ncompany. Triad. And then requires the officer/broker,\nMeyer in this case, to sign a certification which\nspecifically says, I certify this salesperson is employed\nby me.\nQUESTION: I only have 74 pages in my joint\nappendix. You said it was joint --\nMR. SCHWEMM: I'm sorry. I -- I misspoke.\nJoint appendix lodging, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh.\nMR. SCHWEMM: It's the large tan one.\nQUESTION: Got you.\nMR. SCHWEMM: And this was done, by the way, for\nMr. Crank on four different occasions.\nWhat I'm trying to -- to say is this is a\nclassic case of joint principal. There aren't -- that\nisn't true, Justice Scalia, in -- in every corporate\nsituation. Of course, not. We don't argue that. We\nargue that this is a responsible human being and that that\nmakes him liable --\nQUESTION: On the major question that we took\nthe case to decide, what -- what's the general rule --\nwell, we can ask the Government -- what the general rule\nfor when we look to State law and when we look to Federal\nlaw. Certainly State law informs what the Federal law\nought to be. That's -- that's Faragher and Burlington.\nMR. SCHWEMM: That would be my response as well.\nWe have a -- a Federal standard informed by State law.\nQUESTION:\nMR. SCHWEMM: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAs this case has been briefed in this Court,\nit's common ground among the parties and the United States\nthat questions of vicarious liability under the Fair\nHousing Act are to be decided on the basis of generally\napplicable principles of agency and corporate law rather\nthan by reference to a rule that's distinct to the FHA.\nAnd obviously, it is a -- an important general principle\nof corporate law.\nQUESTION: Well, do we look to general Federal\ncommon law agency principles, or are we bound by State\nagency law, Mr. Stewart?\nMR. STEWART: I think the Court -- I'm sorry.\nI think the task for the Court would to -- be to devise a\nuniform nationwide rule. That's what the Court said --\nBut certainly the Court will look as -- as in\nFaragher and in Ellerth, the Court looked to the\nRestatement of Agency which for the most part is a\ncompilation of decisions rendered by State courts. So\nit's -- it's looking to the law of the States generally,\nbut it's not looking to the law of a particular State. So\nwith respect to our veil-piercing argument, we would say\nthat the Court should devise a uniform Federal --\nQUESTION: Well, do you think it's fair to read\nthe complaint that was filed as putting anyone on notice\nthat it was a veil-piercing case?\nMR. STEWART: We think that the claim was\nadequately raised in the district court.\nQUESTION: Where?\nMR. STEWART: The --\nQUESTION: Could you read it to us?\nMR. STEWART: The -- the plaintiffs --\nQUESTION: Because it's not clear to me.\nMR. STEWART: The plaintiffs --\nQUESTION: I don't think if I read that\ncomplaint, I would read it as one that was proceeding on a\nveil-piercing theory.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the --\nQUESTION: I would have thought it was\nproceeding on the designated broker theory.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the plaintiffs -- the\nplaintiffs didn't use the phrase, veil-piercing, but on\npage of the joint appendix, for instance, they alleged\nthat Mr. Meyer is the designated officer/broker of Triad,\nthe president of Triad. They also alleged that\nMr. Meyer -- they alleged that Mr. Meyer was the sole\nshareholder of Triad. In addition, as Mr. Schwemm pointed\nout --\nQUESTION: But that would be consistent with a\ncorporation that's wholly adequately funded and -- and\nwhose -- which -- whose veil cannot be pierced.\nMR. STEWART: And it's true that they -- they\ndidn't allege in the complaint inadequate capitalization.\nHowever, as Mr. Schwemm pointed out, there was a colloquy\nin the district court in which the petitioner's counsel\nappeared to acknowledge that the corporation was without\nassets. And --\nQUESTION: But it isn't -- I mean, look. The\njudge is sitting there on a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint, and he reads the complaint. And when he reads\nthe complaint, he looks to claims, and he sees first\nclaim, Fair Housing Act, which doesn't have a word about\nthis theory. And apparently in the brief, a different\ntheory was produced, the one that's been produced today,\nthat the reason they're liable is not because we want to\npierce the veil, but because it's Mr. Meyer who's really\nthe holder of the license in some sense, and that is\nsufficient.\nSo not surprisingly, the district court says\nthat. He says any liability against Meyer as an officer\nof Triad would attach only to Triad in that plaintiffs\nhave not urged theories that could justify reaching Meyer\nindividually, with one exception. And he then goes and\ndiscusses the exception. Well, if I were a district\njudge, I would have thought I had done my job at that\npoint unless somebody came in and petitioned for rehearing\nand said, judge, you missed something, which no one did.\nMR. STEWART: I think you're right that the\nprimary theory that the respondents advocated in the\ndistrict court was based on Mr. Meyer's --\nQUESTION: No. Sole. Let's try sole theory.\nMR. STEWART: Well, this -- this was raised and\ndisputed in the Ninth Circuit; that is --\nQUESTION: In the footnote.\nMR. STEWART: Not just in the footnote. In the\nNinth Circuit at page 7 and 8 of the petition appendix,\nthe Ninth Circuit having turned to the possible liability\nof Mr. Meyer as the shareholder of Triad. And the Ninth\nCircuit said petitioner Meyer disputes that he was sued in\nthat capacity. However, the Ninth Circuit goes on to\nhold, we disagree. We think that claim was adequately\nraised in the district court.\nQUESTION: Of -- of course, what was raised is\nwe get Meyer because Meyer holds the license, and even\nthough it's held in the name of the corporation, that\nreally doesn't matter.\nMR. STEWART: No. But the Ninth Circuit clearly\nunderstood the claim against Meyer as shareholder to be\ndistinct from or at least in addition to the claim against\nMeyer as designated officer/broker.\nThat is, what -- what seems to us to make this a\nparadigmatic case for veil-piercing, taking the facts --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe it is.\nMR. STEWART: -- in the light most favorable to\nthe respondent, is the combination of functions that\nMr. Meyer played.\nNow, it's true that the respondent by and large\nand the Ninth Circuit appeared to regard these distinct\nfunctions as separate and independent bases for liability.\nBut in our view, it's only a short step to say even if no\none of the roles that Mr. Meyer played would be an\nindependently sufficient ground for imposing personal\nliability, the combination of functions, together with the\ninadequate -- apparent inadequate capitalization --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, as -- as I understand\nthe theory of why the failure to bring forward affidavits\nor some -- some evidentiary proof of these matters at the\nsummary judgment stage was not necessary, as I understand\nit, the plaintiffs' theory is it wasn't necessary because\nthe piercing-the-veil portion of the complaint never made\nit to the summary judgment stage. It had been dismissed\non the face of the complaint. Is that correct?\nMR. STEWART: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Now, was there an appeal of that\ndismissal on the face of the complaint?\nMR. STEWART: The -- the ultimate -- there was\nnot a separate appeal, but the ultimate appeal that went\nto the Ninth Circuit was an appeal both from the dismissal\nof certain portions of the complaint and from the grant of\nsummary judgment with respect to --\nQUESTION: What portion? Was -- it was an\nappeal of the -- of the portion of the complaint that\ndismissed -- dismissed a -- a veil-piercing --\nMR. STEWART: It was not specific. The -- the\nappeal from the dismissal was with regard to Mr. Meyer's\npotential liability as shareholder and the appeal from the\ngrant of summary judgment with regard to his potential\nliability as designated officer/broker was based on the\ngrant of summary judgment.\nQUESTION: Well, so in addition to the complaint\nbeing very vague, the -- the appeal of the dismissal was\npretty vague too. I -- I don't understand what -- I mean,\nif you were objecting to the dismissal of the -- of -- of\na veil-piercing theory, you -- you should have, it seems\nto me, come forward and say, I object to dismissal of that\ntheory.\nMR. STEWART: I would acknowledge that the\ntheory that -- that we and the respondents have -- the\nveil-piercing theory that we have advanced in this Court\nis a refinement of what was said in the Ninth Circuit.\nBut it's -- it's always been part of the case that\nMr. Meyer's liability was alleged on the basis of his\nstatus as shareholder, his status as designated\nofficer/broker, his status as president. And again, the\nclaim in the Ninth Circuit tended -- tended to be more\nthat these were independent bases for liability. And our\nview is that no one of them would be sufficient in and of\nitself. Taken together, they establish that Mr. Meyer\nexercised pervasive control over --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, I'm -- I'm confused\nabout one procedural point. Was there not a final\njudgment in the district court --\nMR. STEWART: There -- there --\nQUESTION: -- at the end of the rope, one final\njudgment that says that defendant wins and then you --\nfrom that final judgment you can take up all the rulings\nagainst the verdict -- the -- the judgment loser?\nMR. STEWART: That -- that's correct. The\ndistrict judge first threw out on 12(b)(6) everything\nexcept the claim against Mr. Meyer as designated\nofficer/broker, and subsequently entered summary judgment\nfor the petitioner on that claim. And then there was a\nfinal judgment and that was taken up to the Ninth Circuit.\nQUESTION: And the final judgment would include\nall the rulings on the way to that final judgment\ndisposing of the entire case.\nMR. STEWART: That -- that's correct.\nNow, in the course of doing discovery on the\ndesignated officer/broker question, they -- the plaintiffs\nunearthed some facts that are potentially relevant to the\nveil-piercing theory, but they've had no discovery on\nveil-piercing as such.\nAnd another important criterion in determining\nwhether veil-piercing is appropriate is whether the\nindividual bears some degree of personal fault for the\nwrong alleged. And here, the plaintiffs' allegation is\nthat Mr. Meyer negligently supervised Mr. Crank, that that\nwas a contributing factor in Crank's ultimate misconduct,\nand that would suffice to show that aspect of the\nveil-piercing analysis.\nI think it's also important to note that courts\nare typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort\ncases than in contract cases; that this Court has\ndescribed the Fair Housing Act as -- as essentially\ndefining a new type of tort. The theory is that in\ncontract cases, an individual who contracts with a\ncorporation has his own opportunity to assess the -- the\ncorporation's finances and decline to do business if the\ncorporation seems likely not to be able to satisfy its\nobligations whereas in a tort case the -- the potential\nplaintiff has no opportunity to do that.\nInadequate capitalization has always been an\nimportant factor in veil-piercing analysis, and really it\ngoes to the question whether the incorporators have\nadequately respected the independent status of the\ncorporate entity.\nQUESTION: You don't -- you don't rely in your\nsubmission on the proposition that under California law,\nthe broker is liable.\nMR. STEWART: We -- we don't. That --\nQUESTION: And is that because you accept the\ndistinction between a corporate broker -- a broker's\nlicense which is in the corporation?\nMR. STEWART: I think it's partly that. I think\nit's partly just the general background rule is individual\nsupervisors are ordinarily not vicariously liable for\ntorts committed by the people they supervise.\nQUESTION: Suppose in a majority of the States,\nthe broker is liable for the -- I forget the --\nintervening corporate -- suppose in a majority of the\nStates, the broker is liable for the acts of the\nsalesperson.\nMR. STEWART: May I answer?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: If a consensus developed among the\nStates that designated officers/brokers were sufficiently\ndifferent from ordinary supervisors that they should be\nheld vicariously liable, then we would advocate that as\nthe general Federal rule. But the respondent has not\nestablished that there is such a consensus.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Benedon, you have 7 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. BENEDON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BENEDON: Your Honors, I would submit at\nthis point unless there are any further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: I --\nQUESTION: Oh, excuse me.\nQUESTION: I do have -- I'm still -- what is --\nwhat is your response to the -- to the assertion that it\nwas not necessary for the plaintiffs to bring forward any\naffidavits or evidence at the summary judgment stage\nbecause on the -- on the veil-piercing issue -- because\nthat issue was no longer alive at the -- at the summary\njudgment stage. It had been dismissed on the complaint.\nMR. BENEDON: I would start from the premise\nthat the veil-piercing theory was never born, not that it\nwasn't alive. Okay?\nQUESTION: In other words, you -- you concede\nthat then and -- and you -- you fall back on -- on the\nsimple fact that the veil-piercing theory was never -- was\nnever really contained in the complaint.\nMR. BENEDON: Never contained in the complaint,\nnever raised --\nQUESTION: But it is actually. I mean, it says\nthat -- that the -- the defendant violated the Fair\nHousing Act when his agent discriminated. That's what it\nsays in paragraph 41.\nAnd then previously in paragraph 13, it lists a\nwhole lot of facts about the relationship of Mr. Meyer to\nthe company including the fact about the tax numbers and\nso forth.\nAnd so what they say is, you know, the complaint\ndoesn't have to spell out every theory, but it does state\nsome facts there from which this basis could be fairly\ninferred, and therefore it shouldn't have been dismissed.\nRather, they should have had at least an opportunity to\nargue it.\nclaim.\nMR. BENEDON: But again, we have to look at what\nare the allegations in the complaint.\nQUESTION: Well, the allegations are just what I\nhad said, paragraph --\nMR. BENEDON: There --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BENEDON: There are allegations of sole\nownership, corporate -- that he was the sole owner, that\nhe was the officer/broker, and that he was the president,\nand that the taxes were paid under his ID number, an\nallegation that's never been proven.\nI think most telling to what was the issue in\nthis case is the holding of the Ninth Circuit itself, and\nthat's at page 67 of the joint appendix where the court of\nappeals states where common ownership and management\nexists, corporate formalities must not be rigidly adhered\nto, a holding which is clearly erroneous, but which sets\nout what was the issue in this case. The issue was not\nunder-capitalization. The issue was not mismanagement of\ncorporate formalities. The issue is -- was could\nMr. Meyer as an individual be held liable because he was\nthe sole owner, president, and designated broker of\nTriad -- Triad Realty. Excuse me.\nAnd for that reason, the Ninth Circuit should be\nreversed and the judgment of the district court in favor\nof Mr. Meyer reinstated in full.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Benedon.\n"
