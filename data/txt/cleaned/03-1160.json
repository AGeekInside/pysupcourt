GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners submit that the Age Discrimination\nin Employment Act prohibits an employment practice that\nhas a significant disparate impact on older workers if\nthat practice lacks any reasonable business justification.\nThe ADEA embodies Congress' determination that\nage discrimination seriously impedes older Americans'\nability to participate fairly in the American work force.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Goldstein, let me just\ninterrupt a minute. You say if it lacks the -- the\nbusiness justification. But is it not a part of -- that\nis not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is\nit, that it does not show? That's an affirmative defense.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, there is not a\nclear answer to that question in all candor. It is not\nbefore the Court. I will tell you that the lower courts\nuniformly in the ADEA disparate impact context apply\nJustice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the\nWards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act\nrule. That is a debatable proposition because, as your\nquestion suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute\nwhere this provision comes from -- and let me just take us\nto the language. It would probably be most useful. In\nthe blue book, the -- the blue petitioners' brief at page\n1 are the relevant provisions.\n(a)(2) we'll come back to. That's the parallel\nlanguage to Griggs.\nThe reasonable factor other than age provision\nis (f)(1), and it says: it shall not be unlawful for an\n-- this is at the bottom of the page. It shall not be\nunlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise\nprohibited -- and I'm going to come back and focus on that\n-- under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based\non reasonable factors other than age.\nThe fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems\nto suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as\nyour question indicates. And the Court in the -- the\nWestern Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ\nprovision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative\ndefense. So I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You put your finger on exactly\nwhat's the part of this case that's bothering me. Read\nthrough the language. As you read through the language,\ndisparate impact does seem to be called for, and this\nparticular provision, reasonable factors other than age,\nseems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to\ndisparate treatment. And that all seems to work.\nBut you read the definition of reasonable factor\nother than age to mean business necessity or even Justice\nO'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough. It's hard for\nan employer to make that defense. And while making it\nhard to make that defense in the case of gender or race\ndiscrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly\nwell. You start making it hard to make that defense here\nand you're going to have a nightmare because every effort\nby any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment\nof his or her employees is going to have a disparate\nimpact in respect to age because the correlation with age\nruns into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other\ncases.\nSo I can't believe that Congress really would\nhave wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is\nbecause I can't believe the business necessity part of it.\nAnd so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the\nsame time, pulls in disparate impact and business\nnecessity, and now I don't know what to do.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I can tell you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer is that you should\nrecognize, as does the commission, which has delegated\nrulemaking authority under the act, that business\nnecessity, which is the term of art that they used in the\nregulation -- and we'll come back to it. It's at page 2\nof the blue brief -- means different things in different\ncontexts. And so I want to take you to the specific\ncitations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense\nprinciple. We know that more things that are legitimate\nemployer practices correlate with age than they do with\nrace and gender. It is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, before you do\nthat, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this\nstatute doesn't -- at least on -- on the page 1 part you\ncalled our attention to, doesn't refer to business\nnecessity. That's in the EEOC regulation. If I were just\nreading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like\nan affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems\nlike something quite different than necessity. It isn't\nnecessary for the business to do this, but it's\nreasonable. And if that's -- then the business necessity\n-- it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper\nconstruction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when\nit referred to business necessity. They were thinking of\nGriggs and -- and title VII, but this statute says\nreasonable factors.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Our position relies only\non the statute. We embrace the text of the statute.\n(f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be\nreasonable. We agree with that.\nThe point I would then take you to is that in --\nif the Court were interested in the regulation -- we don't\nthink it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it\nwere, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the\nphrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act\ndoes not mean essential to the business.\nLet me tell you why it used the language it did,\nbusiness necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up.\nAnd that is when this Court first used the words, business\nnecessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove,\nit didn't have all the connotations that it does now as\nbeing quite a high employer burden. If I could just read\nto you two things from Griggs.\nGriggs said, the touchstone is business\nnecessity. If the employment practice cannot be shown to\nbe related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.\nIt simply required related to job performance. That's the\nbackdrop on which the EEOC used the word.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not sure you're\nright about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of\nwhat it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high\nschool diploma. Now, an employer might well think I want\nto upgrade my work force. I want this to be a real classy\nwork force. So I'm going to require a high school\ndiploma. It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable\nfor me to do that? So I -- I don't -- I think Griggs\nspoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a\nlarge part of the population didn't have the opportunity\nto get high school diplomas. That doesn't exist in the\nage discrimination area. So I -- I don't think that\nGriggs is an example of something that was a loose\nbusiness necessity rule.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: My point is only terminological,\nand that is, when the EEOC used those words, it did not do\nso against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation\nthat was necessarily very strict, and it has said several\ntimes -- and they are quoted in our brief -- that the\nstandard -- and this is just the bottom line. I think\nit's a very important bottom line.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't care about those regs\nanyway. Right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do care about the\nregulations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you do. I thought you were\nsaying you could make your case just on the --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- text of the statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We can and will.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, maybe you should\nbecause I'm not so sure that the EEOC interpretation is\nentitled to Chevron deference.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do believe that it is\nentitled to Chevron deference because they have delegated\nrulemaking authority and there is some suggestion that the\nbecause of language in subsection --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But was this an actual rule\nafter notice and comment, or is it a -- an interpretation?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is a post-notice and comment\nrule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but it interprets --\ndoesn't interpret the prohibitory section. I mean, it --\nit might be understood as simply making an assumption\nthat, say, the Griggs rule would be applied in -- in this\nCourt.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's conceivable you could read\nit that way, although the EEOC has specified many times,\nin the quarter century since it enacted the regulation,\nthat no, when we -- and let me take us to the text to\nexplain why, and that again is at page 2 of the blue\nbrief. They said -- and this is the block quote. When an\nemployment practice, including a test, is claimed as a\nbasis for different treatment of employees or applicants\nfor employment on the grounds that it is a factor other\nthan age, and such practice has an adverse impact on\nindividuals. That's the reference to disparate impact.\nThe regulatory materials cite to Griggs.\nBut in all events, I do want to come back to the\nbottom line, and that is the EEOC recognizes, we recognize\nthat it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the\nburden on the plaintiff's case. It's a -- you have a\nhigher hurdle --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Easier -- easier is a matter of\ndegree.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And reasonable factor could be\ninterpreted to say what the employer -- but the employer\njust doesn't like paying these executives so much money\nwhen these new younger janitors make so little. And so he\nsays, I want to pay the new younger janitors more. Okay?\nThere we've got it. Disparate impact.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now you say, what's the\nbusiness necessity? And frankly, there wasn't one. It's\njust that I found it sort of bad. All right? So there we\nare. I've lost my case.\nNow, that's what is worrying me, and I thought\nperhaps this reg that seems to say -- and lower courts\nhave accepted that I would lose my case -- that this reg\nis outside Congress' -- the agency's authority for that\nreason because Congress couldn't have intended that\nresult.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, let me take you to the\nlines of cases that I think might concern you. There were\na set of cases before this Court's decision in Hazen Paper\nthat involved two rules, Justice Breyer, and I will tell\nyou that you referred to in the Adams oral argument when\nthis case -- this issue came to you before. And so I want\nto refer to a very specific set of cases.\nThere were a set of cases before 1993 in which\nthere was some correlation. High salary correlated with\nage. And the courts of appeals, the Third -- the Second\nCircuit in the Geller case and the Eighth Circuit in the\nLeftwich case treated that as effectively a disparate\ntreatment -- disparate treatment case because of the high\nlevel of correlation.\nThe more recent cases reject that result and we\nembrace the more recent cases. And I want to cite them to\nyou so you could look them up if you wanted. The Evers\ncase, which is 241 F.3d 948; the Williams case, which is\n112 F.Supp.2d 267; and the last one is Newport Mesa, 893\nF.Supp 927. These cases recognized that cost is a\nperfectly legitimate business justification, and they put a\nsingle burden on the employer.\nNow, let me just -- just to say, most impact\ncases aren't cost cases, but I know it's a concern. They\nsay, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of\nyour more expensive work force, we're only going to ask\nyou to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior\nworkers to take a pay cut. They do not say, as did the\nolder cases, that it causes disparate impact and you lose\nyour case. And so we don't --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Goldstein, you -- this is\n-- this case arises out of a compensation program of the\nemployer, and why is it brought under 4(a)(2) instead of\n4(a)(1) which addresses discrimination in compensation?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice O'Connor, the lower\ncourts unanimously conclude, as does the commission, that\n(a)(2), although it does not have the word compensation in\nit, does apply to compensation and --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But why in light of 4(a)(1)?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because they understand 4(a) --\nand let me take you -- everyone to the text just so we can\nall be literally on the same page, and that is going to be\nin the red brief at page 17a. It is 623(a), and it's the\nfirst block quote at the top of page 17a of the red brief.\nThey understand that 623(a)(1) refers to actions\nagainst individuals, whereas 623(a)(2) refers to actions\nagainst groups, group policy versus individual action, and\nthey do that because of the introductory language to\n(a)(1) and (a)(2), to fail or refuse to hire or to\ndischarge any individual; whereas, (a)(2) refers to limit,\nsegregate, or classify his employees.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question at this\npoint going really back to the question I asked you at the\noutset of the argument? If I thought seniority or years\nof service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I\nthought this particular compensation program was based on\nyears of service rather than age, can I look at the\nreasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your\ncomplaint states a cause of action?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Hazen Paper established\nthat that is not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if I do look at it and if\nI do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not\nhave to dismiss your complaint?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I may misunderstand the\nhypothetical, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The hypothetical -- and I\nthink it may be the case -- that you have a compensation\nprogram which uses years of service as a basis for\nclassifying employees which has a disparate impact on\nolder workers, but it does -- also it relies squarely on a\nreasonable factor other than age if you will call years of\nservice such a factor.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's perfectly\nlegitimate. That -- as I understand the hypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose I want --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that to be this\ncase.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it would not because the\nrationale given by the employer here for -- let -- let me\ntake us to the facts and then the explanation that's given\nby the employer. What happened here is they gave all of\nthe line police officers much bigger raises than they gave\nto the more senior officers. That -- and the difference\nin pay between protected persons under the ADEA and non-\nprotected persons was 4 standard deviations, a 1 in 10,000\nchance, statisticians will tell you. And they said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the basis for\ndifferentiation was years of service, was it not?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The basis for differentiation\nwas years of service, but the question is in -- is it a\nreasonable choice by the employer in this context. And\nthe reason is it's a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm just asking in the\nabstract. Why wouldn't that always be a -- a reasonable\nfactor other than age?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. That -- and so I\nthink I answered your hypothetical too broadly. And that\nis, it depends. In the great majority of cases, employers\ncertainly can say I want to give a class of employees more\nmoney. Perfectly sensible. Congress didn't intend to\nblock that. But the question is, is this outside the\nusual set of cases? And the city's explanation what --\nfor this policy, which was to give the line cops more\nmoney but not the rest of the cops who happen to all be\nover 40, was that they wanted to bring the salary up to a\n-- a regional average. And so we asked the question, does\nthis accomplish that in a reasonable way, and it does not\nbecause they left out huge categories of employees.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the factor -- if I\nunderstand it, it wasn't because they were line officers,\nit was rather because they had lesser years of service\nthan the more senior officers.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not the facts here.\nThat's right. They -- they did not say we are going to\ngive pay raises to the people who have lesser years of\nservice because we're concerned about their pay. To the\ncontrary.\nLet me take you to one piece of the record that\nI think will be helpful. Although again the cases\npresents the legal question, the lower court on remand can\nresolve the case. But at page 15 of the joint appendix,\nthere is the pay plan itself, and the first sentence is\nthat -- they -- explains the purpose. The -- the city\nwanted to provide a compensation plan that will attract\nand retain qualified people, and then it says, to all\nemployees regardless of age. They purported to be giving\nthe same treatment to everyone regardless --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think the statement of\npurpose tells me what the -- what the criterion for the\ndifferent treatment was. I still think it was years of\nservice.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, I -- I just\nthink that -- it misunderstands the facts as I know them\nin this particular case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What was the criterion?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The criterion was that they took\nthe -- they had different kinds of officers. They had\npolice -- line police officers, master sergeants, all the\nway on up through the system.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So in other words, the\ncriterion was the kind of rank they had before.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, and then --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that a reasonable\nfactor other than age?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is not whether that\nbecause that's not -- having those criterion is perfectly\nreasonable. The question is, is it reasonable -- and this\nwould be resolved on remand -- to give raises to only one\nof those categories when your explanation is that you were\ntrying to give raises to bring everyone up to a regional\naverage? And so, Justice Stevens, I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, you say the --\nthe question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor\nother than age. Your question is whether the use of those\nfactors was overall reasonable.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. There are two things.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's a rewriting of the\nstatute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, I -- I don't think so,\nJustice Stevens. It's the same question that we ask in\ntitle VII, and that is, was it a -- a -- there's a higher\nbar there, but were you pursuing a -- a legitimate goal\nand did you -- did you pursue it in a reasonable way?\nThat's why a title VII plaintiff -- and this has -- and I\ndo want to come back --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Title VII doesn't have\nthis language in it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's absolutely right, but\nit's not language here that would detract from that\nstructure of the -- of the title VII inquiry. All the\nlower courts, for example, agree that it -- as I said,\nfollows the pre --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here you're saying\nyou're not attacking reasonable factor other than age. It\nhas to be based on reasonable factor other than age. And\nI take it here you're saying it's not based on what they\nadvance as reasonable factors.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. They give --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. They give an explanation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if I -- I say my\nexplanation for why I pay the newer people more is really\nI like to have that atmosphere. You make less money in my\nbusiness, but it's more democratic and people are happier\neven though no one will invest in my company.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But still, I'd like a commune.\nAll right? That's how I want to do it. Now, that's not\ntotally idiotic. It's plausible. So I just win. Right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. You would lose a treatment\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, I lose a treatment case.\nNo, no. I'm not -- I'm just -- it's I'm not paying the\nyounger workers more. I'm paying the newer workers more.\nAll right? They happen to be much the same category, but\nI -- I don't want it. It's not age. Or, you know, I pay\nthe lower paid workers more. How's that? Do I win?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You paid the lower paid workers\nmore?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I paid the lower paid\nworkers more? I want to bring them up to the executives.\nI -- I like it. It's more democratic and it makes a\nhappier group. And -- and so, now, do I win or lose?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You, in all likelihood, win in\nthat hypothetical. You --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I win. And I don't have to say\nany more than that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nBut let me tell you, it's still a very important\nstatute because -- for the reason that I framed before,\nand that is, most cases that are ADEA disparate impact\ncases are not cost cases. There are other tests:\napplications procedures, strength tests, and the like.\nThat's what the EEOC believes is still very essential. So\nwhile we don't impose a big burden on employers in the\ncost context for the reasons that you and Justice Stevens\nhave been exploring, that doesn't mean our position is\nsomehow worthless. The EEOC has said that the disparate\nimpact plays a, quote/unquote, vital role under the ADEA\nand that the respondents' position would greatly weaken\nthe statute because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There haven't been a whole\nlot of cases under the impact theory as applied to age,\nand you just said you're not talking about the cost\ncategory but that -- you mentioned physical fitness. And\nthere was a case. Smith against Des Moines involved that,\nbut it was found the -- the physical fitness test was job-\nrelated.\nHave there been mutual rules with a disparate\nimpact that you can give us as examples? When you're\ntalking about race and sex, the examples come to mind much\nmore readily than in the age category.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I can. I'll give you two\nsets of examples. The first is the examples identified by\nthe Solicitor General in his cert petition defending the\nEEOC's position in the Francis W. Parker case in 1994.\nThe EEOC pursued cases -- and they're cited in the cert\npetition -- involving rules that prohibit -- that require\nrecent college graduates to get a job that forbid hiring\nsomeone who worked previously for a higher salary than\nthey would be getting in the new -- in the new job and\nthat laid off people who would be eligible to retire soon.\nSo those are the examples the Solicitor General gave.\nI'll give you two other examples. One is a -- a\ncase called --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These are examples of--\nviolations or things that are okay?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Violations. I apologize. The\nEEOC filed suit because of these violations of the act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it a reasonable\nfactor other than age that I don't want to hire somebody\nwho's going to retire a year after I hire him?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because it's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, that seems to me terribly\nreasonable.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care how old he is. I\ndon't want anybody who's going to retire the year after I\nhire him. I don't want to have to go through this -- this\nwhole process again.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The view of the commission --\nit's one I share, but a particular court might not -- is\nthat that is not a good -- a reasonable work place\njudgment. One could disagree with it. But the -- those\nemployees will be very valuable. And it's not that they\nwill retire, I should make clear. It's that they're\neligible to retire. It -- it may well be a different case\nif you could say, I asked the person. They said they're\nleaving in a year. The rule challenged there was mere\neligibility to retire, and they did give the other\nexamples.\nI didn't finish with the court cases. They are\nKlein, which is 807 F.Supp. 1517, which is a hiring test I\nthink by the FAA in that case that -- that happened to\nexclude all of the people, I think, over the age of 55.\nAnd there are other cases that are, in the line of cases\nthat I was discussing with Justice Breyer, in which the\nemployer doesn't say -- doesn't give the person who gets\nthe higher pay the option of taking a pay cut before being\nfired. So the statute, both in the non-cost context and\nthe cost context, has very important applications.\nI did want to return to your correct premise,\nhowever, Justice Ginsburg. You said there aren't many\ncases. I think it's important to recognize that the --\nthe important, legitimate cases, by and large, are\nconciliated by the EEOC. Remember, it goes through an\nadministrative process first. The EEOC found a violation\nhere, gave us a right to sue letter. The -- the city just\ndeclined to settle with us. There have been -- and I have\nchecked. There have been 74 disparate impact cases in the\nhistory of the statute that are reported in the Federal\ncourts, and I think that is a good answer to the idea of\nthe respondents that this will impose a huge burden on\nemployers, the idea that there will be a massive amount of\nlitigation. Remember --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, once we -- if we were\nto say it's covered, don't you think that number would\nexpand?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's possible it would expand\nsome, but I do think we're right to say not much\nbecause --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's not the number of\ncases either. I mean, you could have -- it wouldn't take\nmuch to have a single case that has a rule in it, say,\nthat makes it very difficult for an employer to do things\nof type X or type Y, and that would have enormous impact\neven though you'd say, well, it was just one case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, there are two fears I\nthink the respondents have articulated, neither of which\nare borne out by actual experience because, Justice\nO'Connor, the EEOC has recognized these claims for a\nquarter century. Until 1993, every single circuit agreed\nwith us, and right now three circuits agree with us. So I\n-- there is a large body of experience that suggests --\nand that's where those 74 cases come from.\nSo, Justice Breyer, they have two concerns. One\nis the mere notion of the possibility of liability will --\nand the prospect of how expensive litigation would be --\nwould be deterring valuable employment practices. That's\nnot borne out by experience. Your point is, well, what if\nthe liability threshold is too high? And experience\nsuggests and the rules endorsed by the commission and the\nlower courts are that the liability threshold is not too\nhigh.\nI did also want to say that it is the liability\nthreshold that is the key for deciding how to accommodate\nthe respondents' concerns. Justice O'Connor's Watson\nplurality opinion explains that the evidentiary standards\nthat apply in these disparate impact cases should serve as\nadequate safeguards. The precise, same argument was made\nby the business community in Watson, saying, look, we're\ngoing to have to adopt quotas. This will be entirely\nunmanageable.\nBefore I sit down and reserve the remainder of\nmy time, I did want to say we have a really good case, to\nrefer back to my last argument, and that's Griggs, which\nis about the exact same statutory text. And then we have\na line, a wall that is uninterrupted of this Court's\nauthority. Six straight decisions say when the statute --\ntitle VII says something and the ADEA says the same thing,\nthey have the parallel construction. And in our view the\nrespondents' arguments aren't good enough to overcome the\ndouble hurdle of stare decisis and Chevron deference.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nIf I may, I'd like to go straight to the\nquestion as to why mere statistical correlations with age\ndon't create a prima facie case of discrimination because\nof age.\nThis Court in its title VII cases has said that\na mere statistical correlation with race or sex can create\na prima facie case of discrimination because of race or\nsex because it's advanced a proposition that there's no\ninherent correlation between race and sex and ability to\nperform a job or do a job. And as a consequence, the\nCourt has said that a statistical disparity is a departure\nfrom the expected norm. Thus, the statistical disparity\ncreates a suspect situation which could be treated as a\nprima facie case of discrimination because of age, to use\nthe Court's term in Watson, the functional equivalent of\nintentional discrimination.\nIn the age context, the premise doesn't apply.\nIn the age context, as Justice Breyer pointed out in the\nFlorida Power argument, as he's pointed out again today,\nage is inherently correlated with myriad selection\npractices. It's painful to say, particularly to a Court\nthat's a little bit older than I am, but our mental and\nphysical capacities are not constant over our lifetimes.\nThey're different for each one of us, but statistically\nthey change over time and they deteriorate over time, and\nprogress doesn't treat the skills and abilities that we\nhave with -- the same way to people who are at different\nstages in life. Our education and our technological --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Verdi wrote Falstaff when he\nwas 70 -- late -- in his late 70's. It was his greatest\ncreation. Something.\nMR. NAGER: There is no doubt, particularly in\noccupations like judging --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NAGER: -- that experience and wisdom may be\nsomething that grow over a lifetime. But as we know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wunsler died at about 28,\ndidn't he?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. 34.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 34, well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me ask you this.\nIf-- if your argument has force, why haven't we been having\nhorrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981\nwhen the EEOC took the position that it takes?\nMR. NAGER: The answer to that is as follows, is\nthat Justice -- Chief -- then Justice Rehnquist, now Chief\nJustice Rehnquist, wrote a dissent from denial at the time\nof Geller v. Markham. And in my practical experience --\nand I do defend these cases for a living -- that put a\ntremendous chill on the plaintiffs bar, and there were\nvery few of these cases brought.\nBut contrary to Mr. Goldstein, who doesn't\nrepresent employers and help them plan their selection\npractices, employers made huge changes in the '80's and\nthe early '90's until this Court's decision in Hazen Paper\nbecause employers were scared of these cases, and so\nemployers started managing the numbers. There were a lot\nof reductions in force in the late '80's, as I'm sure this\nCourt remembers, as our Nation went through a -- a\nindustrial restructuring. And every one of those\nreductions in force, I had to sit down with my clients and\nbreak up the age of the work force into bands and see how\npeople were going to be affected and move numbers. And\nthe irony, of course, is -- is in doing that, employers\nadversely impact the very people who are benefited by the\ndisparate impact doctrine under title VII because the Age\nDiscrimination Act principally favors more senior, older\nwhite males, and when you try to manage your numbers so\nthat you don't adversely impact older white males, what\nhappens is -- is you adversely impact the new entrants to\nthe work force who in the last 25 years have been much\ngreater numbers of racial minorities and females.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the EEOC's\nregulation? Why isn't that -- why isn't that entitled to\nChevron deference?\nMR. NAGER: Let me answer that. First of all,\nthe -- the answer is, is you only get to Chevron deference\nif this statute is not subject to construction by this\nCourt in phase one of Chevron. The first question is can\nthis Court, looking at the language of the statute and the\nother legal materials, interpret the statute to have a\nsingle, reasonably clear meaning.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can we possibly say that\nit's not ambiguous when we have, in another context,\ninterpreted the identical language to permit --\nMR. NAGER: Just the way this Court did last\nterm in the General Dynamics case, which I realize you\ndissented on this point, Justice Scalia. But just last\nterm in the General Dynamics case, this Court held that\nthe phrase, because of age, is idiomatically and\ncontextually different than the phrase, because of race or\nsex. And my point to Justice Breyer is -- is that the\nphrase, because of age, cannot properly be construed to be\nsatisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In that -- in that\ncase, we were construing the word age and age definitely\nhas a different meaning from sex or -- or race.\nMR. NAGER: I'm not saying that the -- the\nGeneral Dynamics case disposes of this case, Justice\nStevens. I'm simply pointing out that, as Justice\nSouter's opinion for the Court last term held, that\nsimilar language in similar statutes can have different\nmeaning and not be ambiguous.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not whole texts, not\n-- I don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a)\nand (b), but this is not a word, age. It's -- it's lines and\nlines, and to -- and to say, oh, in Griggs we held that\nthe title VII language -- this language means you can have\na disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read\nthose very same words to prohibit. In one sense -- one\nyou read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and\nthen you read the same words to say these words\nprohibit --\nMR. NAGER: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- disparate impact.\nMR. NAGER: That is not quite right, Justice\nGinsburg. What we're saying is -- is that the natural meaning\nof the phrase, because of, either in title VII or in the\nAge Act, is a natural, more conventional reference to\nintent. Nonetheless, the Court, because of the objectives\nof title VII and because statistical correlations could\nequal a functional equivalent of intentional\ndiscrimination, construed title VII to go beyond intent-\nbased claims to encompass disparate impact claims. Our\npoint to the Court today is -- is that neither of those\ntwo critical premises apply, that a mere correlation with\nage does not, in the context of age, equal a prima facie\ncase of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so, Congress\nshouldn't have copied the language of title VII. It isn't\na matter of it just accidentally comes out to -- to be\nsounding the same, as though, you know, two monkeys did it\non a typewriter or something. They copied -- they copied\ntitle VII.\nMR. NAGER: Well, they copied it before Griggs\nwas decided, indeed, before any agency of Government,\nbefore any court in this country, and before any academic\nin this country had floated the concept --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's a fair\nconclusion that they meant the two to mean the same thing,\nwhether it was before Griggs or after Griggs. They copied\nthe language. It seems to me they wanted the two to mean\nthe same.\nMR. NAGER: I -- I think that that's wrong,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or at least it is\narguably so, in which case you come back to my question.\nWhy isn't the -- the EEOC's resolution of that ambiguity\nconclusive?\nMR. NAGER: Well, let me answer that question\ndirectly and then come back and argue with you about your\npremise. If you turn to the appendix and on the red\nbrief, page 56a is the regulation. And it is -- as\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, it is not an interpretation\nof the prohibition of the statute. It is an\ninterpretation of the reasonable factor other than age\nprovision. And as an initial point, I'd submit to you,\nJustice Scalia, that it's one thing to defer to an\nagency's interpretation of the provision that you're being\nasked to construe in resolving what the meaning of the\nprovision you're being asked to construe is. It's another\nthing to defer to their interpretation of a distinct\nprovision which isn't a prohibition at all.\nLet me move on and let's read what it says,\nthough. What it says is -- is the following. It's\ninterpreting a phrase that says is based on a reasonable\nfactor other than age, which Mr. Goldstein has conceded in\nhis brief and the petitioners in the Florida Power case\nalso conceded is necessarily a reference to\nintentionality. But there's not a word in this regulation\nabout employer intentions. Quite the contrary.\nAnd the reason why I -- I asked you to turn to\npage 56a of our brief rather than the quotation of the\nregulation in Mr. Goldstein's brief is because there's an\nadditional sentence in the regulation that Mr. Goldstein\ndidn't print in his brief, and that is that the EEOC said\nwhere tests are involved --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where are you reading\nfrom?\nMR. NAGER: Page 56a of the red brief. I'm\nsorry, Justice. It's section (d).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (e)?\nMR. NAGER: (d) as in David.\nWhat the EEOC said is that the reasonable\nfactors other than age provision is not an intent-based\nprovision. It's a business necessity provision. They did\nit, saying it means the same thing as it's -- as it means\nin title VII because their whole purpose here was to\nconform the Age Act to title VII, and they said you have\nto comply, where tests are involved, with the Uniform\nGuidelines on Employee Selection that they jointly\npromulgated with the Department of Labor, the Justice\nDepartment, and the Civil Service branch, whose name has\nescaped me right now.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager, I'm lost. What --\nwhat part of 56a are you referring to? (d)?\nMR. NAGER: (d) on page 56a. I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does it say what you just\nsaid?\nMR. NAGER: Tests which are asserted -- the last\nsentence. Tests which are asserted as reasonable factors\nother than age will be scrutinized in accordance with the\nstandards set forth at part 1607 of this title. Part 1607\nof this title is the Uniform Guidelines on Employee\nSelection.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that's true, but they --\nthey did promulgate this guideline, as far as -- I looked\nit up. At that time, they said, look, it's going to be\ndisparate impact, and they cited Griggs. And people have\nput comments, which I haven't read yet, but I imagine the\ncomments went to disparate impact. And then when they\nrewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of\nexplanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be\ndisparate impact.\nMR. NAGER: I have no doubt that they were\nassuming that this Court's decision in Griggs -- because\nthis is what they said in their comments -- this Court's\ndecision in Griggs required disparate impact analysis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right. But I mean,\nthey -- everybody knew what they were driving at at the\ntime they promulgated this. So it seemed to me that if --\nif we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the\nreg is outside the statutory authority. And it might be\noutside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too\ntough a test.\nMR. NAGER: It's -- it's outside the -- the\nstatutory authority for two reasons.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But now we've heard it doesn't\nembody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC\nisn't here to tell us --\nMR. NAGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what in fact it thinks.\nMR. NAGER: Mr. Goldstein cited a bunch of EEOC\nbriefs in his brief, and you'll notice he didn't quote a\nsingle part of -- of those EEOC briefs which say that the\nstandard under the Age Act is less than the standard under\nthe Age Act. What he cites to is a footnote in his\nopening brief where he quotes one sentence from an EEOC\nbrief where an EEOC appellate lawyer said it is -- is\nlikely that an employer will be able to prevail more\noften.\nThe EEOC never said -- and -- and I litigate\nagainst them. I can tell you the only thing that they\nwould hate less but hate a lot than your ruling in our\nfavor that there's no disparate impact claims at all is\nthat Mr. Goldstein has represented what their version of\nthe defense is because that's not the Government's\nposition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we don't know\nwhat the Government's position is. They're not here. So\nsuppose I think, one, the language is against you, the\nlanguage of the statute. I do think it's against you.\nTwo, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test.\nThree, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and\nthat has to go with the scope of the statute. And four,\nit might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that\ndeals with the problems you're worried about while\nadvancing a disparate impact test. Suppose I think all\nthose things --\nMR. NAGER: Which one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which are at least\nconsistent. What would I do with this case? That's my\nproblem.\nMR. NAGER: Okay. I -- I would submit that you\nshould --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where the Government hasn't\nappeared and told us what they want to do or what they\nthink should be done, et cetera.\nMR. NAGER: I -- I should -- I would submit,\nJustice Breyer, that you should reexamine your premise\nthat the language of the Age Act, both in section 4(a) by\nitself and construed in light of 4(f) and the legislative\nhistory and purposes of the statute encompass disparate\nimpact claims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the EEOC regulation was\nnot so much an interpretation of the statute as an\ninterpretation of Griggs.\nMR. NAGER: Oh, I think that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, maybe this provision\nrepresents the judgment of the agency that Griggs applies\nto this other statute, and -- and I'm not sure that we owe\nChevron deference to that determination.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I -- I don't think you did,\nalthough I don't even think, frankly, from what I've read\nis they made the judgment. They made the assumption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nager, will you go to\nanother one of Justice Breyer's premises? He says\nfollowing the practicalities are with you, which you're\ncertainly going to accept. He says I think the EEOC can\ndeal with some of these practical problems. Do you think\nso? Why not?\nMR. NAGER: Great question and the answer is no,\nthey can't. And the reason is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Give me some examples.\nMR. NAGER: The reason is -- is because if you\n-- if you lower the prima facie case so that it's\nmeaningless, so that it means that all a plaintiff has to\ndo is find a selection practice -- because it's always\ngoing to correlate with age -- it means you shifted the\nburden to an employer in every case to establish that its\n-- its practice meets whatever standard your hypothesizing\nthe EEOC might come up with later, Justice Breyer.\nMeanwhile, the world has to go on, and what my\nclients will do is as follows. They will say, well, you\nknow, we're not going to wait to see if -- if this new\npractice we're going to consider is going to stand the\ntest of time in court and under the EEOC's yet-to-be-\narticulated regulation. We're going to stick with the\ntried and true. We are not going to innovate at all, and\nif we're going to innovate, we're going to massage the\nnumbers while we do it. The employers --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would be a fairly easy\nburden -- a fairly easy burden to meet. And -- and to give\nyou a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of\ntrying to get employers to think about the problem. An\nemployer who uses a different factor which is correlated\nwith age but it's -- it's an unreasonable thing to do or\nit isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that\nhe's working.\nMR. NAGER: Well, as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we could give you an easy\nburden and still accomplish the objective.\nMR. NAGER: I -- I don't want to resist the easy\nburden, but I do want to tell you, as Justice Scalia\npointed out in the Florida Power argument, my clients do\nthink about these things because if -- you know, if they\nadopt an unreasonable practice that has an adverse\nstatistical effect and they think they're likely to get\nsued about it, they actually do have to worry about it\nbecause these cases are tried to juries and they have to\nhave a reasonable explanation for what their practice\nbecause they get tried to juries as disparate treatment\ncases.\nOur point is not that statistics are not\nadmissible. They are. Our point is -- is that they're\nnot sufficient by themselves to create a prima facie case\nof -- because of age, as it would be in a title VII case\nwhere we wouldn't expect to see the statistical disparity.\nSo it's fair to say that there's a reasonable adverse\ninference to be drawn from the existence of the disparity\nitself. That is the premise articulated by this Court as\nto why the disparate impact doctrine can -- can at -- the\nprima facie case aspect of it equals a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination because of race or sex. That is not true\nhere.\nNow, it is also the case that when this Court\nadopted the disparate impact doctrine, it said it placed\nan enormous weight on the objectives of title VII's\nprohibitions, which it construed to be, as Justice\nGinsburg pointed out, eliminating these built-in\nheadwinds.\nWell, when -- when the Secretary of Labor\nproposed the Age Discrimination Act, he gave a report to\nCongress and he said age discrimination is different than\nrace and sex discrimination. It is not based on animus.\nIt is -- it is not dealing with a group of individuals who\nhave suffered cumulative disabilities over their lifetime\nbecause of historic discrimination. He said it's -- the\nproblem of age discrimination is the problem of over-\ngeneralization by an employer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he gave the very same\nexample that was Griggs. He gave the example of the high\nschool diploma because he thought that people of a certain\nage, when there wasn't such general education as there is\ntoday, might not have a high school diploma to a much\nhigher extent than the people who came -- the generation\nwho came after.\nMR. NAGER: But his solution was not a disparate\nimpact doctrine. His solution was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's a little, and you\nsaid his solution was we're going to have training and\nmanuals and all. But that's not altogether clear.\nMR. NAGER: Well, take a look at the statute,\nJustice Ginsburg. Please look at page 15a and 16a in the\nred brief. And if you look at section 621(b) -- it's at\nthe bottom of page 15a of the red brief -- Congress said\nwhat the purposes of the Age Discrimination Act were, and\nit had three, but it's only addressed one through the\nprohibition. The second one was to prohibit arbitrary age\ndiscrimination in employment. The other two were to\npromote employment of older persons based on ability and\nto help employers and workers find ways of meeting\nproblems arising from the impact of age on employment.\nAnd if you turn the page and look at section\n622(a)(1), the very first thing Congress mandates that the Secretary\nshall do to address its other two purposes, to undertake\nresearch and promote research with a view to reducing\nbarriers to the employment of older persons and the\npromotion of measures for using their skills.\nWhat the Secretary of Labor's report goes on at\nlength about is it identifies all kinds of factors,\nneutral and non-neutral --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't say there that\nthat is to implement the first -- that -- that only the\nsecond one, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination.\nMR. NAGER: It does -- what it -- you're right\nit doesn't say the following. It doesn't say, and we\ndon't want disparate impact, because in 1967 the -- the\nconcept of disparate impact as a legal theory was unknown\nto Congress, to the courts, and to the administrative\nagencies.\nBut what the Secretary of Labor did do in his\nreport is, after identifying all of the problems that\nadversely affect older workers, he says, I recommend a\ntwo-pronged approach. One prong is prohibitory. It's\ncoercive. You shall not -- we'll prohibit arbitrary age\ndiscrimination in employment, which the Secretary\nexplained to Congress, and this Court last term said\nitself, means a -- is a -- is -- is the use of age as the\ndecision-making criteria.\nHe said, separately we should have a series of\nprograms that seek to enlarge the abilities of older\nworkers, that seek to educate employers about the\nabilities of older workers through non-coercive programs.\nAnd so what this statute does -- and this Court\nhas said it in several of its cases -- this statute was\nbased upon the Secretary of Labor's report. The Secretary\nwrote the bill, and although Congress amended it in other\nways, it didn't amend any of these provisions. That this\nstatute took a more nuanced approach to deal with a\ndistinctly different problem, and the problem --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager, at the end of his\nreport, Secretary Wirtz said the -- a purpose, to\neliminate discrimination in the employment of older\nworkers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt\nacts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present\nemployment practices which quite unintentionally lead to\nage limits in hiring.\nAnd your point, as I understand it, yes, that\nwas one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be\naccomplished with ERISA and other things like that.\nMR. NAGER: Well, the quote that you just gave\nsays that there are express uses of age and there are non-\nage reasons that lead to the use of express limits of age,\nfor example, the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave\nwith Mr. Goldstein, saying, well, I wouldn't want to hire\nsomeone who's going -- who tells me they're going to\nretire a year from now. But if he said I'm not going to\nhire you because you're 64 because I know you're going to\n-- people retire at 65 mostly, that would be the same kind\nof non-age-based motive that nevertheless used age as a\ndecision-making criteria. That's what that quote is\nreferring to. If you -- if you -- the second half --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The quote -- the reference to\nemployment practices which quite unintentionally lead to\nage limits in hiring. I see what you're saying.\nMR. NAGER: Right.\nAnd then -- and -- and the point here is this\nwas thought out. It wasn't thought out as disparate\ntreatment versus disparate impact because the concepts\ndidn't exist at the time, but it was thought out as\narbitrary age discrimination versus other factors that\nadversely bear on older workers. The prohibitions went to\narbitrary age discrimination and didn't go to the adverse\nimpacts. It was the -- the non-coercive measures that\nwent to the adverse impacts.\nLet me go also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No how does that work?\nBecause the -- the particular language, it shall be\nunlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any\nway that would adversely affect an individual's status --\nhis status, it says -- as an employee because of such\nindividual's age. Now, that sounds as if it's driving\nright at disparate impact. It's -- it's unlawful to\nclassify an employee in any way that would adversely\naffect him because of his age. That's what it says.\nAnd then you turn to the defense and it says, but\nthere's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the\nclassification is based on reasonable factors other than\nage. And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at\nthe factor and ask is the factor reasonable. If so, the\nemployer wins if it's really based on that factor.\nMR. NAGER: Two points?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. NAGER: One is -- is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do we get out of that\nlanguage?\nMR. NAGER: Well, we love the language. We\ndon't have to get out of it. It says because of age.\nThat's a reference, a traditional, conventional\nreference --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it says -- it says\nthat would adversely affect him because of his age.\nMR. NAGER: Well, the first -- before the comma\nis the statement both of the action of the employer and\nthe injury that it has to cause in order for a claim to\nexist, and then there's another requirement. The\nrequirement is -- is that the action and the -- the effect\nof -- the injury that's affected by it be -- because of\nage. That is a conventional reference to intent.\nAnd the confirmation that it's a reference --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It's not intent\nbecause to read it as part of classifying, which\nyou'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have\nto say to classify his employees because of such\nindividual's age. Now, that's a little tough because\nyou're talking about employees, and then you go to such\nindividual.\nMR. NAGER: It -- it -- the phrase, because of\nage, modifies all of the words that precede the comma that\nseparates the two.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Segregate or classify. You\nwant to read it all the way up back to segregate or\nclassify.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I -- I think it does modify\nthe verb, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would be good if you had a\ncomma after employees. I -- I might go along with you if\nthere was a comma after -- to limit, segregate, or\nclassify his employees, comma, in any way which would\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of opportunities\nor otherwise affect his status as an employee, comma,\nbecause of such individual's age -- go way back to before\nthe comma. I can see that, but without the comma, that's\n-- that's an awful travel back to limit, segregate, or\nclassify.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I -- I think that's the\ngrammatically correct way to read it. But even -- even if\nit was just modifying the adversely affect --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would be the natural way.\nMR. NAGER: -- it would still be because of age.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The natural way -- wait. The\nnatural way is to read it as modifying to deprive --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or otherwise adversely\naffect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the natural way to read\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now --\nMR. NAGER: One still --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose we read it that way.\nThen what do you say?\nMR. NAGER: You -- even if you read it that way,\nit still says, comma, because of age, and the because of\nage is a reference to intent, and the confirmation of\nthat, Justice Breyer, is the defense that you keep\npointing to because as Mr. Goldstein conceded in his brief\nand as you pointed out in your questioning, it says, is\nbased on. That is also a reference to intent. This\nstatute is preoccupied with intent.\nWhat section 4(f) was about was identifying the\nsituations in which age would be used but it, nonetheless,\nwouldn't even be arbitrary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, and I guess what\nsupports that reading is that intent -- intent to\ndiscriminate in hiring -- the intentional discrimination\nbecause of age in hiring is covered by (2) rather than (1)\nisn't it?\nMR. NAGER: No, no, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- I mean, if -- if\nyou have a rule -- if you have a rule that you won't hire\nany employee -- I mean, we -- we were talking earlier\nabout the -- the reason -- (2) reads employees in the\nplural, and (1) reads refuse to hire or discharge any\nindividual. So if you have any intentional discrimination\nthat is against a class, it comes under (2) rather than\n(1).\nMR. NAGER: I had never thought of construing\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that wrong? Well, I thought\n-- I thought that's what -- what counsel for the\npetitioner was telling us.\nMR. NAGER: Well, if -- if he did, he's only\nstrengthened our case.\nWhat I want to say to the Court is -- is that\nboth of those provisions are modified by the phrase,\nbecause of age. This Court in Hazen Paper construed the\nbecause of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent\nand said statistical correlations with age are not\nsufficient to establish because of age within the meaning\nof section 4(a)(1). And the presumption of uniform usage\n-- we're entitled to point to it as well that the\npresumption of uniform usage which would be that the\nphrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not\nsatisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.\nAnd the reason why title VII is different than\nthe Age Act -- I keep coming back to this because this is\nso critical, Justice Breyer -- is that the premise of the\nCourt's statistical cases under title VII is that it's --\nit presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability\nbetween the races and the genders, whereas you know and I\nknow that there is a difference in an -- an inherent\ncorrelation between abilities and skills, between people\nof different ages statistically. And so that whereas in\nthe -- in the race and sex context, a statistical\ndisparity by itself points out that there's something\nsuspect and so would justify putting the employer to the\nburden on those occasions which would happen. And by\ndefinition, I think you and I both think, Justice Breyer,\nthat it's not all that often that you're going to have\nthese statistical disparities in the race and sex context.\nIn the age context, they happen all the time. So it's --\nit -- there's no basis for suggesting that a statistical\ncorrelation by itself creates something suspect, and it\nwould rob the notion of a prima facie case of any meaning\nto say that -- that a statistical correlation with age,\nwhich we expect to see all the time, would establish a\nprima facie wrong.\nAnd, of course, the Secretary of Labor wrote a\nreport telling Congress that race and sex were different\nthan age for this very reason.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in your view, is based on\nreasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative\ndefense?\nMR. NAGER: I -- I think that it is -- it was\nintended to address mixed motive cases. That's why it was\nadded. I think it is a indicia of the fact that this\nstatute is concerned with intent in its prohibitions only.\nI'm not saying it's conclusive of that, but I'm saying\nit's another indicia, that if you look at all of section\n4(f), it's about the instances in which age is being\nused --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But is it an affirmative\ndefense?\nMR. NAGER: I -- I don't think that it is, and I\n-- I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, did you challenge the\nsufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did\nnot allege that the -- the program was not based on -- was\nbased on factors that were unreasonable?\nMR. NAGER: I -- I didn't handle the case in the\ntrial court, but I believe that the -- our -- our client\ndenied all of the allegations in the complaint and\naffirmatively said this was -- its salary program was a\nreasonable factor other than age, yes. And certainly in\nthe courts below, the reasonable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What I'm trying to think\nthrough is whether that issue is one that can be resolved\non the pleadings, or does it always require a trial.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I think the question of\nwhether or not the reasonable factor other than age\nprovision, when read in conjunction with section (a)(4) --\n4(a) shows that this is an intent-based statute, as a pure\nlegal question, can be judged on the pleadings. The --\nthe question of whether or not a -- in a particular fact\nsituation something is a reasonable factor other than age\nor not I think would be subject to what the proof is. It\nmight be undisputed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On your reading, I just don't\nsee that there's any function. I mean, if disparate\nimpact is out of it, then -- then what work is there for\nthe reasonable factor other than age to do?\nMR. NAGER: It was added in as a safe harbor to\naddress mixed motive cases. There was a concern at the\ntime that since employers had been using age as the\ndecision-making factor, that they would continue to think\nabout it, and the question was raised, well, would that\nmean that the very fact they thought of it, even though\nthey had a nondiscriminatory reason, mean that they still\nviolated the act? And the Secretary said, no, we've put\nin this reasonable factor other than age provision to make\nit clear. It -- it was simply a safe harbor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Nager. I think\nyou've answered the question.\nMr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's\nmake it 4 and a half.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nI want to start with our affirmative case which\nis one of stare decisis and then go to what I think is the\nthing that might concern the Court and that's the\npracticalities of implementing our rule.\nOur stare decisis case I think is fairly\ndecisive. The language of title VII was the model for the\nADEA. It runs all the way through the same in subsection\n(a)(2). This Court construed the text of the statute to\ngive rise to disparate impact liability, and there are six\ncases of this Court that say when the language is the\nsame, because one was derived from the other, we give them\nthe same meaning.\nNow, I take it that the respondents have three\nanswers to that.\nThe first is they attempt to rewrite the\nrationale of Griggs and say Griggs really isn't so much\nabout the text of the statute. It's what Congress was\ngetting after, and this Court in Griggs was principally\nconcerned with the fact that, look, in the context of age\nand sex discrimination, there's no legitimate correlation\nbetween an -- a disparate impact and a legitimate employer\npolicy. That is not, in fact, what the rationale of\nGriggs is.\nThe rationale of Griggs is that it doesn't\nmatter to the employee if you are purposefully\ndiscriminated against or accidentally discriminated\nagainst. Congress was concerned with the effects of\ndiscrimination. And this Court reached that conclusion\nbased on the text of the statute. If I could read from\nGriggs, quote, the objective of Congress in the enactment\nof title VII is plain from the language of the statute.\nThat's the same language as in our statute. The thrust of\nsection 703(a)(2) was to address, quote, the consequences\nof employment practices, not simply the motivation.\nThis Court subsequently reiterated twice that\ndisparate impact comes from the text of the statute, not\nfrom the air. Those two cases are quoted at page 9 of our\nreply brief and they resolve all doubts about commas and\nbecause of or anything like that. The Court in both\nConnecticut v. Teal and Justice O'Connor's opinion for the\nCourt in Watson tied it directly to the statute. If I\ncould just read the Watson example. Again, they're quoted\nin full. In disparate impact cases, quote, the employer's\npractices may be said to, quote, adversely affect an\nindividual's status as an employee because of such\nindividual's race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.\nNow, the second argument they have -- and this\nwas the Fifth Circuit's argument -- is the RFOA provision\nexists in the ADEA, not in title VII. I do not understand\nhow the RFOA provision -- if it means anything, it doesn't\nhelp us.\nAgain, let me take you back to the text. It's\non page 1 of the blue brief. It's in a few other places,\nbut it's there. It shall not be unlawful for an employer\nto take any action otherwise prohibited under subsection\n(a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable\nfactors other than age. The necessary premise of that\nprovision is that something will be otherwise unlawful\nwhen it's based on something other than age. It can't be\ntalking about disparate treatment. The only kind of\nliability that involves factors other than age is impact.\nAnd then on top of that, Congress required that the\nemployer's conduct be reasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What of dual motive?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because the statute refers to\nsomething otherwise unlawful, it can't be talking about\nPrice Waterhouse mixed motive. Price Waterhouse mixed\nmotive cases establish liability; i.e., you're not liable\nif you had another reason for doing it. But the premise\nof (f)(1) is that it's already otherwise unlawful, this is a\ndefense to that.\nThe third thing that they say is that in Hazen\nPaper this Court construed the because of language in\n(a)(1) not to refer to impact. The critical difference is\nthat the (a)(1) language does not include the -- the\nclause that refers to the impact on the employee that\nJustice Stevens and Justice Breyer talked about with Mr.\nNager. They're structured very differently.\nAs to the practicalities, let me just say this\nhas been the rule for a quarter century of the EEOC. It\nwas the rule in every circuit until 1993. It is still the\nrule in three circuits. The notion that there is a big\nproblem with administering it and that the EEOC can't\nrecognize the -- as it has in all the examples we cite,\nthat it's easier for an employer to prevail in the ADEA\ncontext is not accurate.\nI also want to just agree with Justice Breyer,\nthat an important part of impact liability is just making\nemployers think about it. And that comes from Justice\nKennedy's opinion in McKennon where he said that disparate\nimpact, quote, acts as a spur or catalyst to cause\nemployers to self-examine and self-evaluate their\nemployment practices to endeavor to eliminate, so far as\npossible, the last vestiges of discrimination.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.\n"
