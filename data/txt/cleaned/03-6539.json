BEDRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDRICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to address three points.\nFirst, the correct prima facie standard under\nBatson is whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a\nreasonable judge to infer discrimination. The California\nthreshold is too high and incorrectly conflates step one\nand step three of Batson analysis.\nQUESTION: Well now, Mr. Bedrick, are -- are you\ntalking about enough evidence, say, to -- for a trial\njudge to let a case go to a jury or enough evidence to\npersuade a trial judge who's sitting as the finder of\nfact? I think those are two different things.\nMR. BEDRICK: I would say the former rather than\nthe latter, Your Honor. I'm suggesting sufficient\nevidence to permit a reasonable trial judge to infer that\nthere was racial discrimination in jury selection.\nQUESTION: So it -- it doesn't have to be proven\nby a preponderance of the evidence.\nMR. BEDRICK: Absolutely not. California uses a\nstandard of preponderance of the evidence and we believe\nthat is substantially higher than that which the -- the\nstandard which this Court suggested in Batson and in\nPurkett v. Elem and in Hernandez v. New York. This\nstandard is substantially higher than used by anywhere\nelse in the country.\nQUESTION: What's the best analog that you have?\nProbable cause doesn't seem to fit. Reasonable suspicion,\nreasonable grounds for belief. Are -- are there cases\nwhich tell us what little semantic formulation you want to\nuse?\nMR. BEDRICK: That's a good question. In\ndiscussion with associates, we thrashed that around.\nProbable cause is much too high. Reasonable suspicion,\nwhich is lower than probable cause, starts to get near it,\nbut I know the Court had a reasonable suspicion case last\nweek and I don't know all the intricacies of it. My sense\nis somewhat -\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's not the\nstandard for letting a case go to the jury, though. It\nseems to me that if that's what you're appealing to, what\nthe test ought to be is not whether the judge thinks it's\nmore likely than not, but whether a reasonable jury could\nthink that it's more likely than not. Surely that's the\nstandard for letting a case go to the jury, not a\nsuspicion. You know, if the judge thinks --\nMR. BEDRICK: No.\nQUESTION: -- he has to say a reasonable juror\ncould find that it is more likely than not that the\nplaintiff's case is -- is sustainable. Isn't that the\ntest for going to the jury?\nMR. BEDRICK: When the test goes to the jury,\nthe plaintiff has the burden of proving his case by a\npreponderance of the evidence.\nQUESTION: The jury has to find it by a\npreponderance.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: But in order to let it go to the\njury, I had always thought that the criterion was not\nwhether the judge thought it was more likely than not but\nwhether in his view a reasonable jury could think it more\nlikely than not.\nMR. BEDRICK: I think that is close to the test\nthat I'm asking for, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: You had a model -\nQUESTION: Of course, that standard applies\nafter the -- after the case has been -- has been tried and\n-- and both sides have had an opportunity be heard. All\n-- all you're asking for is the opportunity to make\ninquiry.\nMR. BEDRICK: Absolutely, Your Honor. All we're\nasking is that prosecutor be -- or the -- or the\nchallenger, whoever that may be, be asked the reason. So\nwhat we are ask -- our standard is somewhat closer to a\ndiscovery standard.\nQUESTION: You're asking more than that. You're\nasking under our law that if the -- if the prosecutor\ndoesn't come back with a reason, you win.\nMR. BEDRICK: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You're not?\nMR. BEDRICK: I respectfully disagree. The\nseries -\nQUESTION: The -- the prosecutor can stand\nsilent and -- and -- and the -- the judge can still find\nagainst you.\nMR. BEDRICK: Very much so because the -- the\nseries of cases from this Court, the Batson-Hernandez-\nElem trilogy, and -- and also the -- some of the Title VII\ncases provide that even though the burden of producing\nevidence shifts, the burden of persuasion never shifts.\nSo -\nQUESTION: But the persuasion burden would be\nfor the jury if you submit enough to make out a prima\nfacie case. The Title VII cases deal with a situation\nwhere you've made the prima facie showing. You don't\nnecessarily win if the defendant comes up with a\nnondiscriminatory reason. But if the defendant just\nstands silent -- you've made your prima facie case.\nDefendant says nothing. Don't you win at that point?\nMR. BEDRICK: No, Your Honor, I do not win\neither under Batson or under Title VII. This Court\ndecided a couple of cases, including Reeves and St. Mary's\nHonor Center in which the finding was a prima facie case\nwas made, the employer gave a reason, the trial judge said\nI disbelieve that reason -\nQUESTION: Yes, of course, but suppose the\nemployer gives no reason.\nMR. BEDRICK: I don't -\nQUESTION: Suppose that the prosecutor stands\nsilent. Those are all cases where the prosecutor does\nwhat you would expect. The defendant does what you\nexpect: come up with a reason. But if no reason is\ngiven -\nMR. BEDRICK: In the Batson context, Your Honor,\nwe have never come across a case -- there may be one. We\nhave never come across one where the prosecutor stood\nsilent. The prosecutor always has a reason.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you were asked to\nconsider what -- what does it mean, this prima facie case,\nif the defendant does stand silent. It may be implausible\nthat the prosecutor would or a defendant would in Title\nVII.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, but even so, even -- even in\nthis theoretical and I think inconceivable hypothetical\nsituation, if the challenger stood silent, the trial judge\nstill has to determine whether or not the objector has\nproven discrimination at that point, at stage three, by a\npreponderance of the evidence.\nQUESTION: I -- I suggest that the reason you've\nnever come across a case in which the prosecutor stands\nsilent is because the prosecutors know that if they stand\nsilent, they lose.\nMR. BEDRICK: No. The prosecutor -\nQUESTION: It's not at all inconceivable. I\nmean, that -- that's why they always come up with a reason\nbecause, as I understand the way we formulated our -- our\nTitle VII test, you -- you have to come up with an excuse,\nand if you don't have an excuse, the plaintiff wins. I'm\n-- I'm not sure I agree with that, but that's what our law\nis.\nMR. BEDRICK: The prosecutor knows that he will\nlook bad if he does not come up with a reason. A\nprosecutor knows that the trial judge could infer that\nsomething is up or something has been done wrong if he\ndoesn't come up with a reason. But our prosecutors are\nbright and energetic and talkative and garrulous people.\nThey always have a reason for everything.\nSo in this case -- and even there are many\ncases. In the many cases where the question of prima\nfacie case is being discussed and it looks like it's a\nclose case, in many of those, a careful prosecutor will\nsay, Your Honor, let's not hang this case up at the prima\nfacie level. I would -- let's -- let me not leave a\nrecord that is not clear. I would like to tell you what\nmy reason is and here -\nQUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical\nquestion? I hate to push you to the wall on it, but\nsupposing you had a prosecutor who conducted the voir dire\nfor the first day and then was hit by a truck and died and\nwasn't able to continue the trial. And he had made one\nchallenge of one African American juror, but he had let\nsix others on the jury. What -- what would you do with\nthat case? Would that be a prima facie case or not?\nMR. BEDRICK: With one juror challenged, six\nremain, from the defense perspective, I would say I have a\nvery lousy -- lousy chance of making a prima facie case,\nand I would not make that argument.\nQUESTION: What if there were one and otherwise\nit was an all-white jury?\nMR. BEDRICK: Then I guess we would hope to find\nsome evidence of the prosecutor's reason. Perhaps he\nhad -\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm positing a case in which\nfor reasons beyond the control of the prosecutor, they\ncan't tell what the real reason was of the man who\nconducted the voir dire.\nMR. BEDRICK: At that point I would suggest that\nthe wise trial judge would find a prima facie case, avoid\nany possible RICKS discrimination and ask jury selection\nto begin anew. At that point, the cost to the system is 1\nday of poor jurors parading through. That's a much lower\ncost than the risk of this case going to the jury and\nbeing tried by a jury that has been chosen with racial\ndiscrimination.\nQUESTION: What if it comes up -- comes up on\nappeal? I mean, it's happened. In the case -- because\nthe trial judge lets the case go forward.\nMR. BEDRICK: I -- I need some more facts.\nQUESTION: No. The appellate court has to\ndecide whether -- whether the conviction has to be thrown\nout -\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes. The -\nQUESTION: -- on the basis of a -- a strike that\nthe appellate court has no way of finding out the reason\nfor.\nMR. BEDRICK: If -\nQUESTION: The only prospective black juror was\nstruck.\nMR. BEDRICK: That is why we are arguing here\nfor this -- for the threshold that we are arguing for,\nwhich is a relatively -- relatively low threshold at which\nthe trial judge examines all the circumstances and, when\nin doubt, rules that there should be a prima facie case,\nand then we get an answer, and then the trial judge makes\na decision based on an answer, and then we get a record.\nQUESTION: Why do you say when in doubt? I\nmean, isn't it enough to say the trial judge has to -- can\nfind that there's a prima facie case of discrimination,\nbut why slant it one way or the other?\nMR. BEDRICK: Because in response to the last\nquestion, I was trying to show that one of the things that\nare missing when a -- when the questions are not asked of\nthe challenger is a record. We do not know what the\nanswer would be, and that puts the appellate court in a\nmuch more difficult situation. So that is what I was\nsaying. When we're -- when in doubt, one of the benefits\nthat we obtain from an answer is a record so that it can\nbe reviewed.\nFurthermore, my guess is most of the\nprosecutor's answers will, in fact, show race-neutral\nreasons. Then we have no problem. Everyone knows what\nthe situation is. The answer has been revealed. It does\nnot become an appellate issue and everyone then has\nconfidence that the jury has been fairly chosen.\nQUESTION: Tell me how it works. You have some\nsuspicion, because of the issues in the case and so forth\nafter the first minority juror is excused, and say oh-oh,\nthere may be something going on here. At -- at what point\nunder California procedure do you think you should make\nthe objection? At the earliest possible opportunity when\nthey've excused the first minority juror or you wait until\nthe whole jury is empaneled and ready to be sworn? How\ndoes that work?\nMR. BEDRICK: I would say it depends on the\ndiscretion of the objecting party. If there was only one\nminority juror and defense counsel thought that that was a\ngood juror and therefore smelled possible discrimination,\nthen defense counsel might make the challenge at the time\nof the first juror. If -\nQUESTION: What happened here? Was it after the\nsecond juror or after the first?\nMR. BEDRICK: The first motion here was made\nafter the second African American juror and the second -\nQUESTION: And then renewed on the third.\nMR. BEDRICK: -- and the second motion was made\nafter the third African American juror. So defense\ncounsel did not -- did not make his motion at the earliest\npossible opportunity. He may have been giving his\nopponent the benefit of the doubt. But after the opponent\nchallenged two out of two, he no longer thought there\nshould be a benefit of the doubt.\nQUESTION: And under your procedure, how long\nwould this take? You say, Your Honor, I want an inquiry\ninto why this juror was excused and the -- I guess the\njudge excuses the -- the panel, or the prospective panel,\nand then says, Mr. Prosecutor, can you tell me why you\nexcused the jury. Is that the way it works?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes. In -- in this -\nQUESTION: Don't -- don't they just go up to the\nbench? Do they have to excuse the whole jury panel?\nMR. BEDRICK: I've seen it done all different\nways. I've seen it done out in the back hall. I've seen\nit done at the bench. I've seen it done with the room\ncleared, and I've seen it done in front of the whole jury.\nThey do it all different ways.\nQUESTION: What happened here?\nMR. BEDRICK: Here both motions were discussed\noutside of the presence of the jury, and that was, of\ncourse -\nQUESTION: And the trial judge did what? He\ndecided on his own that there were good reasons?\nMR. BEDRICK: The trial judge in this case on\nthe first motion, decided that there was no prima facie\ncase because the trial judge speculated as to possible\nreasons on the record that might theoretically and\narguably have provided a race-neutral reason.\nQUESTION: And was the judge asked if the\nprosecutor could be asked to explain?\nMR. BEDRICK: The trial judge asked the\nprosecutor, Mr. Prosecutor, I'm about to -- I'm in the -\nI'm about to rule that there's no prima facie case. Do\nyou have anything you want to add? Do you have any\nreasons you want to state? And the prosecutor said, no,\nYour Honor, I don't want to -\nQUESTION: Well, why should he -\nQUESTION: Why should he?\nQUESTION: -- if he's already been told?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEDRICK: That was clearly too late in the\nprocess, but there are many other cases I mentioned\nearlier where when a prima facie case seems relatively\nclose, the intelligent prosecutor will give a reason and\nmake his record and protect his record.\nQUESTION: Counsel --\nQUESTION: -- in the law -\nQUESTION: -- before you exhaust your time here,\non appeal did you challenge also an evidentiary point, a\nBrady claim?\nMR. BEDRICK: There are other issues -\nQUESTION: There are other issues in the case.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: The Brady claim, some evidentiary -\nand -- and a new trial was granted on some of those\nissues?\nMR. BEDRICK: No. This -- this case has been\ntried three times. In the -- the first case got three\nquarters of the way through. There was a Brady problem.\nA mistrial was granted. There was a second trial. There\nwas a conviction after the second trial. In that second\ntrial, there were instructional errors regarding\nconcurrent causes. There was a reversal on that. This\nnow is the appeal from the third trial.\nQUESTION: On the third trial, were there other\nissues?\nMR. BEDRICK: There are other issues that the\ncourt of appeal did not reach.\nQUESTION: That were not reached.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: But do we have a jurisdictional\nproblem? Do we have a final judgment?\nMR. BEDRICK: We certainly have a -- we\ncertainly have a final judgment from a trial which is a\nconviction of the defendant. We have a -- we have a\ndecision from the intermediate court of appeal that says\nreversed. We have a decision from the State supreme court\nthat says reversed again. So that we have lost our -- we\nhave lost our Batson argument.\nQUESTION: Well, but it's sent back. Wasn't it\nsent back to the court of appeals for further proceedings\nin this case?\nMR. BEDRICK: The -- yes.\nQUESTION: Well -\nQUESTION: And you may win on two -- on either\nof two issues that are left in the court of appeals.\nMR. BEDRICK: That is theoretically possible,\nbut I think -\nQUESTION: But that's on three of those issues.\nIsn't it the case that the intermediate appellate court\nsaid there's something going for your side on those three?\nIt's kind of hinted that you have a good case on the\nissues it didn't yet decide.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor,\nbut I very much hope that the Court would reach the issues\nhere. We've put in a lot of time on that.\nQUESTION: But we have a firm finality rule. So\nhow can we if the judgment that you're bringing to us is\nnon-final?\nMR. BEDRICK: I believe that -\nQUESTION: We've put in a lot of time on it too.\nMR. BEDRICK: I understand.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I -- I -\nMR. BEDRICK: We have a -- California has -\ndiffers from every other court in the Nation on several of\nthese jury selection points. California has a standard\nthat is much higher than virtually everyone else in the\nNation.\nQUESTION: We understand that it's a good case\nto address the issue, but only if there's a final judgment\nso that we have jurisdiction. Can you enlighten us any\nmore on that jurisdiction point?\nMR. BEDRICK: This issue has not been raised by\neither side in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, it's raised now.\nMR. BEDRICK: I understand that, Your Honor. So\nthat it is my understanding that we have a final -- we\nhave a final judgment from the trial court of convicting\nthe defendant. We have what is a final judgment from the\nintermediate court of appeal, which was a reversal. That\ncourt did not need to reach the other issues. It felt it\ndid not need to bother to reach them.\nQUESTION: But now it does because it's been\nreversed and there's a remand. And when it's remanded, it\nis certainly going to take up the issues that it left\nundecided.\nMR. BEDRICK: If it needs to reach those, that's\ncorrect, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, it's been instructed. There -\nthere are exceptions under our Cox case, and I've looked\nat them. I don't think this comes under them. We don't\nlike to ambush you this way, but I mean, if there's a -\nthere's a real jurisdictional problem here.\nQUESTION: Especially since we gave you the case\nto -- to argue. You are very kindly appearing here pro\nbono.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It seems like a dirty trick.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No. But may I ask on the finality\nquestion? Is the decision of the California Supreme Court\nfinal with respect to the disposition of the Batson claim?\nMR. BEDRICK: It very much is, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: There's nothing more to be decided\nrelevant to that issue.\nMR. BEDRICK: Absolutely not.\nSo that what I was hoping to argue to the Court\nwas we have a very distinct and sharp conflict between the\nState of California and the Ninth Circuit and, indeed,\nbetween the State of California and the rest of the\ncountry on several of these issues. What is the -\nQUESTION: May I ask you one question that is\nrelevant to that? And that is, that California, as I\nunderstand it, is taking the position each State is free\nto implement Batson as it chooses, and California points\nout that it has a standard that's more stringent than the\nFederal standard on disqualifying a juror for race bias.\nThe California standard is significant likelihood that the\njuror is biased, where the Federal standard is a\nreasonable possibility. So California says if we can have\na more stringent standard on disqualifying a juror for\nrace bias, why can't we have a more stringent standard on\nBatson.\nMR. BEDRICK: Because California did not present\nany federalism issues at the State supreme court nor does\nmy opponent. California said we are deciding the Federal\nconstitutional issues. We are deciding this case under\nBatson. We believe that our standard complies with\nBatson.\nQUESTION: I thought part of that was that\nBatson leaves room for the States. It doesn't require\nevery State to -- to handle Batson challenges the same\nway. I think that is an argument that California made.\nMR. BEDRICK: There are -- there -- there are\nsome -- I'm not sure what aspects were left to the States,\nbut California's Supreme Court did not -- the State makes\nthis argument, but the California Supreme Court did not.\nThe California Supreme Court did not say anything\naddressing any independent State ground.\nQUESTION: More a question for the State than\nfor you.\nI -- I can't really think of an analog here.\nOur search and seizure jurisprudence, our arrest\njurisprudence, our Miranda jurisprudence is all uniform.\nHere, of course, State jury selection procedures vary, and\nso there has to be some allowance for that. On the other\nhand, I'm not sure what the State is going to tell me so\nfar as a helpful analog for having a different -\ndifferent rule.\nMR. BEDRICK: The best standard we could come up\nwith, Your Honor, was something that was similar to the\nstandard on a Federal civil procedure 12(b)(6) motion. On\na motion to dismiss, could a reasonable trial -- could a\nreasonable trier of fact find for the plaintiff? That was\n-- that is the closest analog we have.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what you're talking about is\na judgment at the close of the plaintiff's case, aren't\nyou? You're not talking about a motion to dismiss a\ncomplaint before trial.\nMR. BEDRICK: That -- that's what 12(b)(6) would\nbe, Your Honor. So the question is can the plaintiff get\nout -- can the plaintiff get out of the batter's box. So\nthat that is -- that is the type of language that -- that\nwe are seeing in the Federal courts interpreting the raise\nin inference.\nThat's also what we are -- in Title VII context\nwe're actually seeing a lower threshold. In Title VII, to\nestablish a prima facie case, the plaintiff needs to show\nthat he was part of -- of a protected group, that he was\nqualified for a job, that he applied, that he was\nrejected, and the employer is still looking.\nQUESTION: But you -- you do have some\ndifference on a motion to dismiss because the rule is that\nif any conceivable allegations could have been proved in\nsupport of what the complaint says, it shouldn't be\ndismissed. But at the close of the plaintiff's evidence,\nI think it's a little more stringent. It's what -- what\ndoes the plaintiff's evidence show, not what could it have\nshown.\nMR. BEDRICK: I -- I guess I'm persuaded that we\nare somewhat higher than rule 12(b)(6). I think we're\nalso somewhat lower than reasonable suspicion. But I\nthink this standard comes up in many other kinds of\nmotions where ordinary civil procedure motions where a\nplaintiff wants to proceed and for -- a motion for\nchallenged discovery, for example. The plaintiff wants to\nproceed and the defendant says we don't want our witness\nbrought in here. He's an important person. He's an\nofficer of an important corporation, and the judge -- show\nme why we should take that person's deposition. Now, you\ndon't have to prove anything beyond a preponderance. You\nneed to show some reasonable facts that can be learned\nfrom that person. In this -\nQUESTION: But the typical discovery motion\nisn't appealable, so there isn't much writing on the\nsubject of what sort of a standard should apply in that\nsort of discovery.\nMR. BEDRICK: But it -- it could turn out to be\nappealable. The chances of them showing prejudice are\nlimited, but it's the same kind of situation. The\nplaintiff here is trying to obtain some evidence, and here\nit's actually the crucial evidence so that in my discovery\nanalogy, it wouldn't work for -- it wouldn't work for\ngarden-variety discovery, but if we had a major witness\nand a major point, that issue might show up as a -- as the\n-- as the issue on which an appeal turned.\nHere the information we're trying to find is -\ngoes to the guts of the question of racial discrimination.\nIt goes to the reason that the prosecutor -- the reason\nfor the prosecutor's challenge. The trial judge has to\ndecide whether there is a race-neutral reason and whether\nthat was in fact the prosecutor's reason and whether that\nreason was credible. None of that can be determined\nunless we know the prosecutor's reason.\nQUESTION: What if -- what if the trial court at\nthe prima facie stage says it -- it seems perfectly\nobvious to me -- and I think this is perhaps what the\njudge here did -- that the reason the prosecutor did this\nwas thus and so. And then the -- so he doesn't call on\nthe prosecutor, but nonetheless, it's very plausible what\nhe said. Now, isn't that a form of harmless error?\nMR. BEDRICK: I can't see anything remotely\nobvious here, Your Honor, between the State judges and the\nattorney -- State Attorney General's office has speculated\nas to two reasons for challenges to Clodette Turner. They\nspeculated as to five possible reasons for the challenges\nto Sara Edwards, and they speculated on eight possible\nreasons for the challenges to Ruby Lanere.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what --\nMR. BEDRICK: If it was so obvious, they\nwouldn't have 15 speculations.\nQUESTION: What if the prosecutor, after the\nprima facie stage, says I did it for this reason? All\nparties -- the -- the defense isn't bound by that\nstatement, is it? But I suppose the prosecutor is.\nMR. BEDRICK: The prosecutor is, and then the\ndefense gets to argue, as one does in a Title VII case,\nthat there is something wrong with that answer which\ntherefore shows prejudice. Perhaps the prosecutor has\nsaid I challenge this juror because in voir dire, the\njuror said he was -- I believe the juror was illiterate.\nAnd it turns out the question was, Mr. Juror, how do you\nget your news? From the newspaper or television? And the\njuror said, I get it from television. And the prosecutor\nthought that showed illiteracy. If that's the test for\nliteracy, then two-thirds of our population is illiterate.\nThat's why we need to get the reasons. The -\nthe defense is not bound by it. The defense is entitled\nto show that the reason may be pretextual. Sometimes it\nwill be. Sometimes it will not. But unless the -- the\nwhole guts of Title VII where the employer always gives a\nreason is trying to show in one way or another from the\nfacts and circumstances and all the evidence that the\nreason is pretextual. And that should apply in -- in -\nunder Batson in the same way. But one cannot evaluate\nfrom either position, from the defense position or the\nprosecution position, whether the reason is pretextual\nunless one hears the reason.\nAnd if -\nQUESTION: I suppose -- suppose one problem that\nis more difficult in the Batson context -- we're talking\nabout a reason that would justify a peremptory challenge,\nnot a challenge for cause. And I imagine that a good\njudge and a good lawyer could come up with that kind of\nreason for almost any potential juror.\nMR. BEDRICK: We are -- most of the time the -\nthe prosecutors are going to have race-neutral reasons.\nAll -- all we're doing is asking for, to check for the\nunusual circumstance when the reason is not race-neutral\nor when the reason is pretextual.\nQUESTION: I thought you didn't need a reason\nfor a peremptory challenge. I thought that's the beauty\nof -- of a peremptory challenge.\nMR. BEDRICK: A peremptory challenge -\nQUESTION: I don't know. There's just something\nabout this guy. I just -- you know, my antennae tell me\nthat this person isn't going to be good for my side of the\ncase.\nMR. BEDRICK: A peremptory -\nQUESTION: Is -- is that enough of a reason?\nMR. BEDRICK: A peremptory challenge is valid\nfor any reason except an unconstitutional reason.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. BEDRICK: When this Court considered Batson,\nthe argument made by the State is we have a peremptory\nchallenge statute which is very important and you\nshouldn't just brush it aside. And this Court decided in\nBatson, yes, peremptory challenge statutes are important,\nbut the Equal Protection Clause and the U.S. Constitution\nare even more important, and as in the conflict between\nthose two, the Equal Protection Clause, which is\npreventing racial discrimination, which is protecting the\nrights of the individual jurors not to be discriminated,\nwhich is protecting the right of the defendant not to be\ntried by a jury chosen with discrimination, and which is\nprotecting the rights of the public not to have the\ncriminal system upset by discrimination, the -- this Court\nin Batson decided that the Equal Protection Clause under\n-- trumps the right for -\nQUESTION: So what I said wouldn't suffice. You\nsay that wouldn't suffice as a reason.\nMR. BEDRICK: I would say any -- I would say a\n-- the -- I don't want to put you -- Your Honor in those\nshoes, but a prosecutor -- we've never seen a prosecutor\nnot have a reason. So if you -- so if you were the\nprosecutor and you said, I have a hunch, the trial judge\nwould probably ask, counsel, please I need more than a\nhunch. Please give me the reason for your hunch. And\nyour answer is I don't like jurors who have beards, I\ndon't like jurors who have long hair, I don't like postal\nworkers, some basis for the hunch. Any prosecutor who is\nnot discriminating would have a basis for that hunch.\nIf there are no questions, I'd like to save my\nremaining time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bedrick.\nMr. Schalit, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH K. SCHALIT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHALIT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe more likely than not standard identified by\nthe California Supreme Court gives content to the prima\nfacie case requirement and preserves the proper balance\nbetween the anti-discrimination principles enshrined in\nthe Equal Protection Clause and the State's and parties'\ninterest in using peremptory challenges to select a\nqualified and unbiased jury.\nQUESTION: Just so we can get it behind us, do\nyou have any observation on the apparent jurisdictional\nproblem we have? Can you give us a hand?\nMR. SCHALIT: I'll attempt to do so, Your Honor.\nThe situation I think is akin to that under which multiple\nclaims are raised and a court of appeal disposes of it\nbased on one ground and does not discuss anything else.\nAnd that court is therefore -- thereafter reversed on\nappeal. I think that is a final judgment. The -- the\ndefendant in this case has been deprived of his reversal\nand that is what -\nQUESTION: Even when it's been remanded, when\nthe judgment is, you know, I decided on this ground and\nthen I remand it for further proceedings in the case?\nMR. SCHALIT: I think so, Your Honor, in that\nthe -- the legal issue is -- is still present as to the -\nQUESTION: That's not the test. The test is\nwhether the case is final.\nMR. SCHALIT: Regrettably, Your Honor,\nunfortunately I haven't had time -\nQUESTION: Yes, we sort of sprung it on you.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. I just thought you might have\nan answer.\nMR. SCHALIT: That's as best as I can do. My\napologies.\nQUESTION: You have an issue that's finally\ndecided in this case.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that will be law on the case.\nBut you don't have a judgment, a final judgment in the\ncase because now there are all those issues that the\nintermediate appellate court said it left open. It gave\nsome hints about what validity it thought they had, but -\nbut there is -- there are a number of issues that are\nstill to be opened. So the judgment isn't final. Only\none issue in the case is.\nMR. SCHALIT: My apologies, Your Honor. Beyond\nwhat I've already articulated in terms of that -\ndeprivation of that reversal based on that issue is the\nextent of my knowledge, this issue not having been\nbriefed.\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question about the\nCalifornia standard? Is it -- did you just say the\nstandard is the judge must decide that it's more likely\nthan not that there was discrimination? Or -- and I think\nit would be quite different to say -- the judge must\ndecide that a reasonable juror could conclude that it's\nmore likely than not that there was a -- discrimination.\nMR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. It is not the\nlatter test.\nQUESTION: It's not the latter.\nMR. SCHALIT: No.\nQUESTION: And why shouldn't it be the latter?\nMR. SCHALIT: Because the judge is operating as\nthe fact finder in this setting, and given the nature of\nthe prima facie case requirement, which is one that when\nthe prima facie case is met, entitles the objecting party\nto prevail -\nQUESTION: In your -- in your ordinary civil\ntrials, which view does the -- is -- what is the rule in\nCalifornia? Would -- would it be the one I stated or the\none you stated?\nMR. SCHALIT: That depends on the function of\nthe prima facie case in term -- in -- in the context in\nwhich it's being used. There are two terms -\nQUESTION: Say it's a tort case where he sued\nfor, you know, negligence in driving a car. Which -\nwhich would be the correct statement under California law?\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, if it is a question of has\nthe -\nQUESTION: Do I let the case go to the jury?\nThat's what's before him.\nMR. SCHALIT: If that's the question, then it is\nan inference -\nQUESTION: It's whether a reasonable jury could\nfind that there was -\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And why do you say there's a\ndistinction here? I -- I understood you to -- to say that\nthe -- the distinction rests on the fact that the -- at\nthe -- at the close of -- of whatever argument or point\nthe -- the defense counsel makes, that he's entitled, in\neffect, to -- to win the point. But that's not so.\nMR. SCHALIT: In the face of his opponent's\nsilence, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: In the face of silence.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's a further -- I mean, a further\nfact in evidence. I mean, if -- if somebody puts in a -\na permissive case in a -- in a civil action and the\ndefense puts in nothing, the -- the jury may or may not\nultimately award for the -- for the plaintiff. They may\n-- but in -- in this case, I take it the way it works,\nthere is a -- a presumption that aids the objecting party\nand therefore the objecting party wins. Is -- is that\nyour understanding?\nMR. SCHALIT: Essentially, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SCHALIT: In the -- in the Batson context.\nIt is not a presumption in the McDonnell sense of having\nproved certain predicate elements.\nQUESTION: Okay. But if the -- if, on the other\nhand, the prosecutor does make a response, then there's no\npresumption. Then the -- the judge simply has to make a\ndetermination.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor. The judge\nmust evaluate the response and the -- and the rest of the\nevidence in determining whether the objector has met his\nultimate burden of persuasion.\nQUESTION: And -- and when he does that, he may\nvery well, in effect, say, yes, there's evidence here from\nwhich I could infer discriminatory intent, but I don't\ninfer it. I am not wholly convinced by it for whatever\nreason. And that's -- that's a possible resolution by the\ncourt, isn't it?\nMR. SCHALIT: In a stage three, Your Honor, of a\nBatson proceeding?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes.\nQUESTION: So at -- at the last stage, the trial\njudge is acting as if he were -- it were a bench trial,\nand it's up to him to decide whether there was or was not\na discriminatory purpose.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor. Having now\nheard the reasons, the trial court will evaluate the\ncredibility of the prosecutor. As the plurality\nrecognized in Hernandez, frequently the credibility of the\nstriking party will be dispositive.\nQUESTION: But -- but if no reasons are given,\nit's your position that automatically it's determined that\nthere's a constitutional violation.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor. That is -\nQUESTION: The other side says no.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, that ignores the disposition\nin Batson itself in which the Court explained that on\nremand it was up to the trial court to determine whether\nthere was a prima facie case, and if the prosecutor did\nnot come forward with his race-neutral reasons, the\njudgment had to be reversed. It is that -\nQUESTION: But isn't the -- the position that -\nthat you are advocating, if I understand it correctly, is\nthat the court saves the prosecutor that burden by the\ncourt, before turning to the prosecutor, to say what's\nyour nondiscriminatory reason. The court itself first\nthinks of can the court think of a good reason, and if the\ncourt thinks of a good reason, it never asks the\nprosecutor. That's the -- that's -- as I understand your\ncase, you say that's how it works.\nMR. SCHALIT: Not entirely, Your Honor, in that\nit is not the court's obligation nor do California courts\nseek out to save the striking party. What they do do is\nattempt to determine whether the objecting party has met\nits burden of persuasion at that first step, and in\nconsidering everything before it, it will make that\ndetermination. Now, there may be -\nQUESTION: Well, do you think -- suppose there\nwere 12 peremptory challenges and there were 12 African\nAmerican prospective jurors there and all of them were\nstricken. Is there enough case made if there's an\nobjection by the defense counsel?\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, Justice O'Connor, certainly\nnumerosity is an important point or an important\nconsideration.\nQUESTION: -- in my example.\nMR. SCHALIT: Your -- Your Honor, your example\nactually needs additional facts. If, for example, one of\nthose African American prospective jurors said, I hate\ncops and the second was wearing, you know, Crypts colors\nin a case involving the Bloods, and the third was half\nasleep and the fourth had some other obvious explanation,\nthen no.\nQUESTION: Well, so, the trial judge can look\ninto that as a part of the prima facie case. He can look\ninto what the jurors responded?\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor, because of the -\nit is the trial judge's obligation under Batson to\nevaluate all the facts and circumstances. Batson itself\nrecognized that the prosecutor's questioning during voir\ndire may support or refute -\nQUESTION: Suppose I'm the trial judge and I\nconsider, you know, there are reasons why the prosecutor\n-- legitimate reasons why the prosecutor might have\nexercised this challenge. Do I go further?\nMR. SCHALIT: I think it's up to the trial -\ntrial judge to determine whether the objector has met his\nburden of persuasion as more likely than not. If I can\nsee a legitimate reason --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- the -- the case is the one\nI -- I gave you. There's an objection. And I say, you\nknow, there are reasons why this prosecutor might have\ndone this. Do I quit at that point and say, well, you\nhaven't made out your case? That's the way I understand\nthe California rule, incidentally. If there -- if there\nare reasons that might have allowed the prosecutor to give\nthe peremptory challenge, the prima facie case may not\nhave been made out.\nMR. SCHALIT: And I think it's important, Your\nHonor, to distinguish the rule as understood on appeal in\nCalifornia from the rule in application in the trial\ncourts. It is not can we hypothesize a potential reason\nin -- from the trial judge's perspective that there's a\nchallenge here. It is up to the trial judge to determine\nfrom all of the evidence whether it is more likely than\nnot. And maybe I have a reason but -\nQUESTION: But it's very odd that he would do\nthat without even asking the prosecutor to comment.\nMR. SCHALIT: Not -- not particularly, Your\nHonor. If the prosecutor has -\nQUESTION: I mean, it's odd in the sense that\nCalifornia is one of the only States that does it.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, Your Honor, if the\nprosecutor three African American prospective jurors, all\nof whom are defense attorneys and they're struck by the\nprosecutor, there's nothing odd about not asking about\nthat. They're all defense attorneys.\nIf, however, maybe, you know, there was a little\nsomething that one of the jurors did and I can sort of see\nthe reason for that, but they struck 12 of them and I sort\nof see a reason, that's not enough most likely in the more\nlikely than not context. And the prosecutor will be\nrequired to state reasons.\nNow, that is different than on appeal where, of\ncourse, the judgment of the trial court is presumed\ncorrect and the trial court is the entity that has seen\neverything. And if on the face of the record, there's\nsomething that appears to be the reason, well, then that\nmust be used on appeal, just as in the other appeal to\nsupport the judgment below. But it is the trial court's\nobligation to evaluate everything before it, and to\ndetermine --\nQUESTION: Well -- no, I didn't mean to -\ncomplete your -- the -- the problem I have with -- with, I\nguess, that argument and -- and with the California\nposition is this. I assume that under Batson when and if\nthe time comes for the prosecutor to make a response, we\nwant a -- a context in -- in which the prosecutor at least\nhas got a fair shake to -- to persuade the court. And on\nthe California system, which you're defending, the judge\ndoes not, in effect, ask the prosecutor for a response\nuntil the judge, in effect, has already found against him\non the merits because on your view, the prosecutor has\nsaid implicitly, by a preponderance of the evidence, they\nhave proven discrimination. Anything you'd like to say\nabout that? That's a very different thing from saying,\nthis side's case is in and I might find for them, but I -\nI haven't yet. What do you have to say? It -- it in\neffect on -- on the California scheme forces the -- the\ncourt to say I've already ruled against you based on the\nmerits unless you say something.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor, and that is the\npurpose of the -- of the prima facie case requirement. It\nis to allocate the introduction of the burden of proof and\nit is to protect the constitutionality of the State\nstatute and the nature of the challenges as being\nperemptory.\nQUESTION: But it puts the prosecutor in a -- in\nrather a difficult spot if -- if you get to that point.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, and that -\nQUESTION: Because the prosecutor has already\nbeen told you lose unless you've got a darned good reason.\nMR. SCHALIT: Just as the employer is told that\nessentially in a Title VII case when the evidence is\nintroduced on those four McDonnell Douglas factors and the\nevidence is persuasive.\nQUESTION: But -- but it seems to me -\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: -- the opposite is also true for what\nJustice Souter is saying. The -- the judge says, you're\ngoing to win unless you say something.\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, then there's -\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: So I -- I -- in that instance, he\nobviously says nothing.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: He doesn't say you're going to win.\nHe's going to say there is enough to require you to\nrespond. Whether -- whether you win or lose is up to me\nafter the response.\nMR. SCHALIT: In the -- in the Batson setting,\nin the Title VII cases, in any case in which there is a\nprima facie case found, going back to Kelly v. Peters with\nJustice Story, there is such evidence that unless\nrebutted, the party with the burden of persuasion will\nprevail.\nQUESTION: That is true if you've got a\npresumption working. It is not true if you simply have a\n-- a standard that -- that allows for the permissive\ninference. If -- if nothing more than a permissive\ninference is involved and the case -- and the defense puts\nin no case, the plaintiff may or may not win. The only\nthing that makes the difference is -- is whether a\npresumption operates to convert the permissive case into a\nvictory, and whether the presumption is going to operate\nor not is a question of -- of policy. It's not a question\nof logical relationships.\nMR. SCHALIT: Certainly it does operate when\nthere is a presumption established by the court, as this\nCourt did in McDonnell Douglas. It also operates when\nthere is a -- what Wigmore referred to as a strong mass of\nevidence. That concept cannot be alighted from the\ndefinition of a prima facie case in that -\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question just to\nbe sure I -- I have your position? The other side says\nCalifornia is the only State in the Union that follows\nthis strict a rule and the Federal courts all follow the\n-- the other rule. Are they right on that, or do you\nthink they're -- you have company in other parts of the\ncountry?\nMR. SCHALIT: We are -- there are -- there are\nother cases that announced the same standard. Maryland\nannounced it. Connecticut announced it. The court below\nrecognized that. There are a handful of cases on the\nother side that recognize inference. The Ninth Circuit\ndoes.\nQUESTION: The legislature overturned it in\nConnecticut. Isn't that so?\nMR. SCHALIT: My belief is that actually the\nSupreme Court of Connecticut under its supervisory\nauthority established a sort of -\nQUESTION: Anyway, it's no -- Connecticut is not\nout of line anymore.\nMR. SCHALIT: Not -- yes. They don't apply it,\nbut they don't apply it based on their supervisory\nauthority. As an understanding of the meaning of Batson,\nit's still valid. And because it's actually California,\nMaryland, and Connecticut that have considered the meaning\nof Batson and the Title VII cases. The other cases -- the\nNinth Circuit just looked at the word and said inference.\nThey isolated that word from the rest of the Batson\nopinion. That's not the appropriate way to read an\nopinion. It must be considered in context. Batson\nexpressly told the courts to look to the Title VII cases\nfor an explanation of the operation of the prima facie\ncase rules.\nQUESTION: But in Title VII there would be a\npresumption if the employer said nothing. If the -- if\nthe plaintiff shows the McDonnell Douglas factors and the\nemployer doesn't come up with any reason at all, I thought\nat that point, plaintiff wins because there's a reasonable\ninference, plus presumption. Plaintiff wins. When\ndefendant comes forward with a nondiscriminatory reason,\nthen the presumption drops out of the case. Plaintiff\nshoulders the burden of persuasion.\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor. And that is\none example of a prima facie case with a shifting burden\nof production that entitles the party to prevail in the\nface of silence.\nThe other example included in that same section\nof Wigmore is the strong mass of evidence, and he later\nexplains that those things are different in operation and\nthey differ -- but the same in effect. And the effect is\nthe same. The operation is different and the operation -\nQUESTION: But I thought that -- that this Title\nVII, the idea of reasonable inference plus presumption -\nthat that's supposed to be the formula for Batson as well.\nMR. SCHALIT: Not presumption in the sense that\nthere are four elements of McDonnell Douglas that apply in\na Batson context. There can't be those four elements.\nEvery time there's a challenge in a Batson setting, the\nfour elements of McDonnell Douglas, for example, would\nhave been met. The juror would have been a minority\nqualified, excused, and replaced.\nThe -- the reference in Batson to the Title VII\nis not to a presumption, but to the operation of the prima\nfacie case rules, and the operation of those rules are\nsuch that you provide sufficient evidence to entitle you\nto prevail in the face of silence. And Wyoming ties that\ntogether with being synonyms for the same mechanism. They\nare akin to presumptions.\nQUESTION: I thought he said that the\npresumption operates in the run -- mine run of cases, it's\nthe presumption that the -- what you call the strong\nevidence test -- that's Batson for special instances and\nit isn't the dominant rule.\nMR. SCHALIT: That -- Your Honor, Wigmore\nrecognized there are these two means in which you can\ncreate the prima facie case. One is the presumption. And\nthat is helpful in a case in which there's a run of the\nmill type facts and in the run of the cases, that fact\nthat is presumed, more likely than not, follows from the\npredicate facts. That cannot be applied in Batson.\nWhat does apply in Batson, however, is the other\naspect of the prima facie case mechanism recognized by\nWigmore which is the strong mass of evidence concept.\nThat has to be what is applied here in that the nature of\nthe jury selection -\nQUESTION: The -- the problem with -- with this\nis, though, is that, say, in the employment discrimination\ncase, there's been discovery. The events have happened\noutside the hearings of the court. There has been time to\nlook at it. Here the alleged wrong is occurring right in\nthe courtroom in front of the judge. And so all they're\nsaying is that the judge should, in an appropriate case,\nsay, hey, what's going on here, Mr. Prosecutor. That's\nall. And -- and it seems to me that's a very, very\nminimal intrusion on -- on the trial.\nAnd the -- the State of California's rule seems\nto presume that the defense counsel, if -- if he's the one\nobjecting, has the resources of discovery and -- and the\nopportunity to -- to reflect and -- and to find other\nevidence. He doesn't. The jury is being selected now.\nMR. SCHALIT: Precisely, Your Honor, and that is\nto his advantage. As -- as U.S. v. Armstrong recognized,\nthe res gestae takes place in front of the court. It\ntakes place in front of the parties therefore. Everything\nthat that party needs is available to the party. This is\nnot Swain where the objecting party would have to engage\nin some sort of historical discovery and analysis.\nEverything the party needs is there, and the striking\nparty has -\nQUESTION: Everything the party needs except the\nstate of mind of the prosecutor, and the -\nMR. SCHALIT: Correct, Your Honor, to which he\nis not entitled until he demonstrates entitlement to\nrelief and is able to overturn the statute and make it\nunconstitutional as applied. This Court has already\nrejected -\nQUESTION: Of course, the irony of that is that\nif -- if you had an ordinary civil lawsuit and the\nplaintiff files a complaint on information and belief -- I\nhave good faith and belief such and such happened -- then\nhe takes a deposition and asks the defendant did it\nhappen. But here you can't do that. You got to know the\nanswer to what your information and belief is before you\nfile your complaint.\nMR. SCHALIT: That's -- that's the nature of\nprivilege of peremptory challenges, the nature of any\nother privilege that protects information.\nThis Court has already rejected this sort of\ninference standard in its voir dire cases. It's -- it\nrequires that you inquire of jurors, if there's a\npossibility of -- not if there's a possibility of\nprejudice but if it's constitutionally significant.\nQUESTION: Is it appropriate in a case like this\nto weigh, on the one hand, the importance of the interests\nthat are protected by the Batson rule and, the other hand,\nthe burden on the prosecutor by having to answer the\nquestion? Is that an important part of the analysis?\nMR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. It's not a\nquestion of the burden of the -- of the 10 seconds it\ntakes to state an answer. It is a question of the burden\non the peremptory challenge system and the effect on the\nvoir dire process. A low standard will create an\nincentive to bring these motions more frequently. That\nrequires excusing the jury every time. That requires\ntaking a proceeding and getting an answer. And that may,\nin turn, require proceedings through rebuttal. Well,\nlet's go through our dozen discharged jurors and piles of\nquestionnaires to do a determination of whether this is\npretext.\nMoreover, it is the nature of the peremptory\nchallenge system that is entitled to protection. These\nchallenges are peremptory. We don't want to discourage\nchallenges based on hunches which will be discouraged\nunder a lower standard. This gives the trial courts a\nclear guidance.\nQUESTION: Of course, there are those -- I\nremember Justice Marshall used to take the position that\nit would be better for the system as a whole if we\nentirely abandoned peremptories because you -- you're\nbetter off if you always know what the reason is. At\nleast that's a permissible view.\nMR. SCHALIT: Yes, that was his view, Your\nHonor. And the reason he had that view was because he did\nnot like the Batson rule which required a flagrant showing\nof discrimination in order to rise to the level of a prima\nfacie case. He understood that a prima facie case was one\nthat entitled the party to relief. That was the -\nQUESTION: But they -- most -- most\njurisdictions -- most courts that considered this issue\nhave the reasonable inference and that gives rise to the\npresumption. California is in a minority. Are you saying\nthat California is right and everyone else is wrong? Or\nthat you're both right?\nMR. SCHALIT: Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure\nthat the numbers are that stark, given that most cases -\nQUESTION: Whatever. There is a divergence.\nMR. SCHALIT: There's certainly a divergence.\nQUESTION: Now, are you saying there is only one\nright way and that's California's, or are you saying it's\nup to the States? They can have one rule or the other.\nMR. SCHALIT: Your Honor, I think that certainly\nthe footnote in Batson in the final part of the discussion\nrecognizes the -- that it is left to the States to\ndetermine procedures to govern Batson. Now, on the other\nhand --\nQUESTION: Does that mean -- procedures to\ngovern -- that one State can have reasonable inference\ngives rise to presumption and in another, as California,\ncan have strong likelihood?\nMR. SCHALIT: Quite possibly, Your Honor, in\nthat we believe more likely than not is -- is the result\nfrom Batson given the Title VII description. On the other\nhand, there is that -- that footnote and leaving to the\nStates.\nAnd it is not unheard of, to return to Justice\nKennedy's earlier question, to have some variance. And I\nthink one good example of that is incompetence and Medina\nv. California, which recognized that California could use\nthe more likely than not standard and place that burden on\nthe party claiming he was incompetent. Other States can\nhave a different burden.\nQUESTION: Because you -- you said something\nabout one of the reasons you're resisting this is it may\n-- it prolongs the trial and you have to clear the jury\nand the -- in the -- the places that have reasonable\ninference plus presumption, has there been this slowing\ndown, the clogging of the court? Has -- has what you're\npredicting played out in reality?\nMR. SCHALIT: Your Honor, I'm not aware of\nanyone having conducted a time in motion study of -- of\nvoir dire in the various States to find out how they're\nproceeding. Certainly the system does not have to\ncollapse in order to conclude that the more likely than\nnot standard, with its advantages and its compliance with\nTitle VII, with the holding in Batson, with the nature of\ndeclaring the statute unconstitutional as applied, is\nconstitutionally prohibited. It is a somewhat surprising\nnotion to suggest that using the lowest of the three basic\nburdens of persuasion is constitutionally prohibited.\nQUESTION: I -- I did -- the question I asked\nyou was just a purely practical one. Has what you\npredicted as the adverse consequences, if you loosen up\nthe -- what the plaintiff has to show -- what the\ndefendant has to show -- and my understanding is that -\nthat it hasn't been a big problem in the Federal courts,\nin States.\nMR. SCHALIT: I think it's unknowable, Your\nHonor, that the -- the extent to which the system is\nburdened is not something that can be readily determined.\nYou can infer that there is a burden imposed on it, one\nthat California can legitimately seek to avoid by using\nthe most common burden of persuasion.\nQUESTION: Well, how does California handle a\nchallenge for cause? Does it clear a courtroom every time\nsomeone makes a challenge to cause? Does it call counsel\nup to the bench to give their reasons simply to the judge\non the record or some third way? How does -- how does it\nhandle it?\nMR. SCHALIT: Frequently it's done at the -- at\nthe bench, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, this -- couldn't the same thing\nbe done on -- on a Batson challenge?\nMR. SCHALIT: It's not typically done that way.\nThe -- the -\nQUESTION: Well, why couldn't it be?\nMR. SCHALIT: The -- the first step perhaps\ncould be, but at some point there's going to need to be\nmost likely further proceedings or to then go back and\ndetermine whether those reasons are pretextual. We'll\nhave to excuse the jury to go through the questionnaires\nand -- and do a comparison.\nAnd that wouldn't happen in a -- in a challenge\nfor cause. The -- the challenge for cause is pretty much\nover at that point because the judge knows it's just that\none juror and -- and can make that determination based on\nthat juror and -- and the information presented by the -\nthe challenging party. A Batson proceeding is much larger\nthan that.\nYour Honors, the -- the more likely than not\nstandard is an appropriate standard. It is supported by\nthe effect on the statute declaring it unconstitutional as\napplied. It avoids using an inference standard that does\nnot provide guidance to the trial courts, a standard that\nthis Court has already rejected in the voir dire context.\nIt maintains the proper balance between the anti\ndiscrimination goals of the Equal Protection Clause and\nthe peremptory challenge system what this Court -- which\nthis Court has repeatedly recognized plays an important\nfunction in serving the selection of a fair and qualified\njury.\nThe judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bedrick -- or rather,\nMr. Schalit.\nMr. Bedrick, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDRICK: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIn this case, the prosecutor preempted all three\nAfrican American jurors, leaving a black defendant to be\ntried before an all-white jury in a case that had racial\nissues. If this Court -- this is a paradigm of a prima\nfacie case. This is a much stronger prima facie case than\nthat which is required in virtually all of the Federal\ncourts.\nIf this Court does not reach this question\nbecause it finds something that still is alive below, I\nrespectfully submit that this Court would be sending a\nvery poor message to the State courts and a very poor\nmessage to the Federal courts, namely, that yes, it is\ntechnically in error but it's not important enough for us\nto decide. I'd respectfully ask the Court to reach this\nissue.\nIn terms of what would happen if the States -\nat the State court, I don't think I -- I could never get\nback to this Court or anywhere else. Let us say I go back\nto the State court of appeal. The State court of appeal\nrules against me on the evidentiary issues and says,\ncounsel, on the Batson issue we'd like to rule for you but\nthe State supreme court said no, so we can't do anything.\nReview at the State supreme court is discretionary. I\nfile a petition for review and the State supreme court\nsays we decide that -- we already decided that. We don't\ncare. Get out of here. Review dismissed.\nI then will be trying to come to this Court,\nhaving gotten no opinions from the court of appeal, having\ngotten a postcard denial from the State supreme court and\nI would not be able to get here. I think that will be --\nQUESTION: Yes, you would. You'd have a -\nQUESTION: We'll be waiting.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You'd have a decision from the\nhighest Court in the State that has ruled on it, and you\ncould -- you could come here. You would have then -\nlet's say you have a judgment affirming the conviction.\nYou could come here from that.\nMR. BEDRICK: If -- if that was a guaranteed\ninvitation, Your Honor, I would accept it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEDRICK: But odds on getting to this Court\naren't quite so guaranteed as -\nQUESTION: We will -- we will already have done\nthe work. Your odds are better than most people.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So will you.\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: Well, and importantly, we know what\nthe California Supreme Court's final word is on it\nalready.\nMR. BEDRICK: We don't know. Every time around,\nthey make up a new definition. They had strong\nlikelihood. They had not -- they had dispositive\ninference. They had conclusive presumption. This time we\n-- this time they made up more likely than not. They may\nmake some other standard. We don't know what they're\ngoing to do, and it's a -- it's a moving target and it is\n-- the target is moving in the direction of denying -\ndenying consideration of these cases and the target is\nmoving in the direction of denying the opportunity to show\nwhether or not there's discrimination.\nIf the California court's standard of\npreponderance of the evidence is allowed to apply, we\nbelieve that will eviscerate Batson because that means you\ncannot get in California what you would get -- at least\neviscerate Batson in California because that would mean\nyou cannot get in California what you could get anywhere\nelse in this country on these facts -\nQUESTION: But maybe they can get it from the\nNinth Circuit.\nMR. BEDRICK: That is possibly true.\nQUESTION: It's definitely true. Hasn't the\nNinth Circuit disagreed with the California Supreme Court?\nMR. BEDRICK: Yes, and we have this continuing\nbattle where counsel is required to spend and waste\nenormous amounts of time going back and forth and back and\nforth. I mean, I guess this case could become my career.\nI'd sort of ask the Court --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEDRICK: -- to let me go on and -- I want\nto represent my client, but I'd ask the Court to let me go\nand do something else.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEDRICK: In conclusion, I would ask to\npoint out to the Court that obtaining the reason is the\nmost important thing we're asking here. It's very simple.\nMost of the time it will solve the problem. We won't be\nbouncing back and forth between courts.\nDiscrimination cannot be shown unless the\nchallenger's reasons are known. I would ask this Court to\ndecide this case in a way that challenger's reasons become\nknown.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nBedrick.\n"
