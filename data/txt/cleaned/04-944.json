SCHWARTZ: Mr. Schwartz.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schwartz. Excuse\nme. Mr. Schwartz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA Federal court has subject matter\njurisdiction over a claim brought under title VII\nregardless of whether an employer has 15 employees.\nThis is so because when Congress enacted title VII, it\nincluded a specific jurisdictional grant and that grant\nprovides that jurisdiction will exist in the Federal\ncourts over all claims brought under the act.\nThis specific grant of jurisdiction is\nconsistent with the more general grant of jurisdiction\ncontained in 28 U.S.C. 1331 wherein Federal question\njurisdiction exists over all claims that arise under a\nFederal law. Title VII is a Federal law.\nThe Fifth Circuit erred when it -- when it\ndetermined that the employer numerosity issue went to\nthe subject matter jurisdiction of the court.\nIndeed, when title VII was passed, Congress\nactually expanded jurisdiction, the Federal question\nissue of title VII, because at that time 28 U.S.C. 1331\nhad a $10,000 amount in controversy requirement that\nCongress did away with because the jurisdictional grant\ncontained within title VII made no mention of the\n$10,000 requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say -- so now it's\nessentially redundant. Now that 1331 has no\njurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the\njurisdictional provision in title VII is just going\nover the same territory. It doesn't add or detract.\nIs that so?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: I would agree with that.\nIndeed, the question --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the first sentence, but\nnot in the venue part.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Not in the venue part and --\nand certainly -- because it does apply to which\ndistrict court a case should be brought. I would say\nit -- it's redundant to the extent of conferring\njurisdiction to a Federal court, but not on the venue\nprovision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is not subject\nmatter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with\nhere.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Right. It's not an issue in\nthis case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nargument, though, that when you're talking about a\nthreshold question like coverage, who the statute\ncovers, and it's quite different from the cause of\naction cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Well, we're talking here about\na question of whether or not coverage is subject matter\njurisdiction, and it's our position that once you go\nbeyond the text and you start evaluating the various\naspects of title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, you are going\ndown a -- a slippery slope.\nAn example would be a case perhaps where a --\nin fact, a case that I'm currently involved in where a\nplaintiff is alleging that they were discharged\ndiscriminatorily. And the reality is from the\nemployer's perspective, that that person was never\nterminated. They're still an active employee. That is\nan essential issue of a cause of action. The coverage\nof title VII --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's more a question\nof -- of whether or not the -- there's been a violation\nof title VII. It seems to me that the number of\nemployee issue is whether you're covered at all,\nwhether you have to conform your conduct to that law.\nYour question -- your -- your case of whether someone\nhas been discharged or not just goes to whether there's\nbeen a violation.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but I believe that the analogy applies because\nit still goes to whether or not you start reading the\nact beyond the jurisdictional grant. It's unnecessary\nto go beyond the jurisdictional grant because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in City of -- in\nCity of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the\njurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of\nthe term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional\nquestion.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I would not\nnecessarily agree that that goes beyond the\njurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant\nof -- contained in 1334 -- 1343 requires that -- that\njurisdiction apply against a person acting under color\nof State law. And that's an example which Congress has\ndone many times of putting qualifiers within a\njurisdictional grant.\nAn example of -- of that we have -- we attached\n60 such statutes to our appendix in our reply brief, but\na specific example, which I think is applicable here, is\nthe Uniformed Service Employee Reemployment Rights Act\nwherein Congress put in that the act would only apply\njurisdictionally, subject matter jurisdictionally,\nagainst employers. And then there's a subsequent\ndefinition of employer further on in -- in the statute\nwhich is missing here because title --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the practical\nconsequence of the one or the other? Number one, if\nyou don't raise it below, you can still raise it on\nappeal if it's jurisdictional. Right?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And number two, the -- if\nit's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by\nthe -- by the judge rather than by the jury?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct as well. And I\nwould go further that the practical problem is what\nhappened in our case where it wasn't raised in the\ntrial -- in -- in the case until after a trial on the\nmerits and after the jury returned the verdict, and we\nwasted a lot of time. It -- it could have been brought\nup beforehand as a -- a substantive motion for summary\njudgment or a 12(b)(6) motion if the pleadings resolved\nthe issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's always the case.\nI mean, why -- you know, if those disadvantages --\nthose disadvantages will always exist. So why would\nCongress ever make something jurisdictional rather than\nsimply making it an element of the cause of action?\nYou understand what I'm saying? I mean, that's always\na consequence.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I think the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And yet, you -- you\nacknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I think if I'm --\nif I'm an attorney representing a plaintiff and I want\nto make an evaluation of whether or not I have a claim,\nI want to first evaluate do I pass a jurisdictional\nthreshold. If a come -- a person comes into my office\nand says, look, this happened to me, I want to bring a\ncause of action, and I know that they employ less than\n15 people, then I'm not going to waste my time.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what's the rule\nthat you suggest we look to in deciding whether a\nprovision is jurisdictional? Because, as the Chief\nJustice pointed out, in 1983 cases where the question\nis whether the defendant is a person, we've held that\nis jurisdictional. So what is the rule in telling us\nwhen we should treat something as jurisdictional?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Well, the rule that has\nexisted for some time now, going back to Bell v. Hood,\nis a -- a fair way to look at this. If a statute, a\nFederal law, creates a cause of action, then a cause --\na cause of action lies absent Congress expressly\nlimiting or qualifying an -- a jurisdictional element\nwithin its grant contained within that law, which is --\nwhich is missing completely in title VII.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you call this?\nWould you call 15 or more employees an element of your\nclaim that you must prove?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or there could be an\naffirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: It could be an affirmative\ndefense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're -- you're\naccepting that it is your burden rather than the\nemployer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15\nemployees.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: More than 15, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: More than.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. That -- that's the\nplaintiff's burden just like it's the plaintiff's\nburden to prove that they were terminated --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you establish that in\nthe course of the proceedings?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: We did not plead it with\nparticularity. We pled that the employer sexually\nharassed the plaintiff, and then thereafter in the\npretrial order, it was not raised as a contested issue\nof fact. And I believe the law of the case doctrine\nwould control in that instance because the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask what --\nhow does the waiver work? Suppose the judge pre-\nverdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are\nless than 15 employees. Can the plaintiff say, oh,\nwell, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that? They\nwaived that. They didn't raise it. I mean, how does\nthat work?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: If it's -- if it doesn't go to\nthe subject matter jurisdiction --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your theory of the\ncase?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: -- then I would say that it is\nwaived, if it's been answered --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but if it's your\nburden to prove it, how can it be waived by the\ndefendant? I don't understand your theory.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the judge just has\nto watch the case sail over the waterfall and --\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Well, let's talk about two\ndifferent examples. If we have pled with particularity\nthat the employer has 15 or more employees and is\nsubject to title VII for liability purposes and the\ndefendant in their answer admits that fact, then that\nbecomes a -- a admission --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in my case nobody\nmentions it but the judge.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: All right. So we have alleged\nin our lawsuit that the employer terminated or sexually\nharassed the plaintiff and the -- there is not -- it's\nnot particularly pled. Is that the hypothetical,\nJustice Kennedy?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and the -- and the\njudge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the\nparties.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: I would think that if the\njudge in a -- in a Federal cause of action was troubled\nby any element of the claim, based upon his or her own\nreview of the factual setting, it's conceivable that --\nthat the court then could entertain motions on that\nparticular issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. You -- you\npleaded -- you pleaded that -- that the defendant was\n-- was an employer under the act. Right?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's the definition of\nemployer that says he has to have more than -- more\nthan 15 employees. So, in effect, you -- in making\nyour complaint, you -- you at least implied and maybe\nsaid that this person is an employer under the act. So\nit seems to me at that point the -- the burden shifts\nto the other side to say -- the burden of going forward\nof saying no, this person isn't an employer under the\nact, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted\nwhat -- what your complaint on its face says.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: I agree with you, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I knew you would.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but maybe --\nbut that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement.\nAll you -- so you file one sentence saying this person\nviolated title VII. Are you impliedly including all of\nthe allegations of what constitutes a violation of\ntitle VII because if you didn't allege every particular\nelement, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII?\nThat's not how pleading works.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: No. And -- and I can -- I can\ntell you, Mr. Chief Justice, I have probably handled\n500 causes of action for discrimination cases, and I've\nnever seen anybody plead the issue of whether or not\nsomebody has 15 employees. It's just not done.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In your pleadings, did you\nsay he's an employer?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did you use the term\nemployer?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: And -- and it was admitted and\nthen it was never challenged thereafter until after the\nverdict.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it -- you -- you\ntold us of your extensive experience. How does the\nnumerosity requirement usually come up? You've\naccepted that it's an element of your claim rather than\nan affirmative defense the defendant must plead and\nprove. So how does it ordinarily come up? Does it --\nbecause defendant answers and asserts that it has fewer\nthan 15 employees?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: I can give you one real-world\nexample, Justice Ginsburg. I represented a defendant\nin a case that didn't employ 15 people, and when I\nattempted to convince the plaintiff -- plaintiff's\nlawyer of that fact after the litigation commenced and\nthey weren't willing to -- to go ahead and voluntarily\ndismiss, I simply filed a motion for summary judgment\nattaching affidavit material, including payroll\nrecords. And then once the plaintiff's attorney\nreviewed that, they voluntarily gave up and the case\nwas dismissed. That would be the way it would normally\nplay out, provided it's not held to be an issue of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\nAnother reason why this should not be a\nsubject matter jurisdiction goes to the practical\nelements of the way this would progress in litigation\nand title VII's admonition, which is a rare admonition\nin legislation, that title VII cases be heard in an --\nis in an expedited way. In enacting that particular\nlanguage, it appears to me that Congress was\nacknowledging that this is a very important law. We're\ntrying to remediate a terrible wrong, that is,\nemployment discrimination. So we don't want these\ncases to languish. It's almost as though it's being\nprocessed like a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\ninjunction proceeding, that this is a case that should\nmove very quickly.\nAnd many courts, like the one across the\nriver in Virginia that are known as so-called rocket\ndockets, process these cases on a very fast track. I\nknow that -- that court does it. Other courts that I\npractice in do it as well where it is not uncommon that\nfrom the pleading that a trial is set as quickly as\n6 months thereafter. If this was to be subject matter\njurisdiction and we had to initially litigate the\nquestion of whether or not the person is an employer\nand putting aside all other issues in the case, it\nwould invariably result in a dragged-out process.\nIn our case, as we -- as we noted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's true in a lot\nof areas. I think of admiralty. If there's an issue\nof admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an\ninjury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you\noften have extended litigation over that jurisdictional\nquestion.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: And -- and in those cases, the\njurisdictional grant in the Jones Act does include\nelements of jurisdiction. So it's -- it's required.\nBut I don't -- I don't believe that the Jones\nAct has the same type of language, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat title VII has, requiring that these cases be heard\nexpeditiously. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it have to\nbe resolved preliminarily? Why can't you leave the\njurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion\nof the trial with all the other questions? Is there\nsome rule of law that says that a jurisdictional\nquestion must be confronted before the trial and before\nthe merits?\nIndeed, most jurisdictional questions are\nreexamined as the trial proceeds. That is, you know,\ninitially the court will say, yes, there appears to be\njurisdiction on the basis of the pleading. Then if\nthere's a motion to dismiss, yes, there -- there\nappears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the\naffidavits. But then if the trial proceeds and it\nturns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the\ncourt dismisses. So why couldn't this jurisdictional\nquestion always be handled that way? Just -- just\nleave it to be resolved during the trial. It wouldn't\nslow anything up.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: There -- there's a few\nproblems with that. One is that it is not uncommon in\ntitle VII cases that there are supplemental State\nclaims brought in the cause of action, and so we would\nhave a situation where there would be a lot of wasted\neffort on the pending claim if, at some point, Justice\nScalia, at the end of the day the case was dismissed on\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\nThat was s situation in our case where we\nhad a pendant tort claim for battery, and we also had a\npendant claim under the ancillary Louisiana\ndiscrimination statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So this is a third\nconsequence of the jurisdictional issue.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the issue is\njurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't\nbelong there and they've got to be chucked out;\nwhereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant\nclaims are properly before the court.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's an important\nconsequence.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: In addition, the Court's\nrecent opinions addressing subject matter jurisdiction\nhave all gone back, it seems to me, to this question of\nwhat does the text say. The -- the issue of not\nconflating the use of the word jurisdiction, which has\nbeen referenced in a number of the Court's opinions,\nSteel Company, Kontrick, Eberhart, Scarborough, all\npoint to the fact that where the text is clear, as it\nis in this case, and there is no ambiguity, then\nsubject matter jurisdiction lies if a claim is brought\nunder a Federal act.\nIf there's no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSchwartz.\nNow Mr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice O'Connor, we think the rule here,\nbecause it's a question of congressional intent, is\nsimply how to best interpret the relevant statutes.\nHere, Congress twice unambiguously conferred\njurisdiction over all title VII claims, at least twice:\nfirst in section 1331 and again in the title VII\njurisdictional provision which confers jurisdiction\nover all claims brought under title VII.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, maybe you\ncan raise the podium a bit so the microphone works\nbetter. The other way.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Sorry. Is that better? Thank\nyou.\nAs I was saying, the question is -- is --\nbecause it's a question of congressional intent, we\nthink normal rules of construction apply.\nAnd, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about\nwhether the title VII subject matter jurisdictional\nprovision is now redundant in light of the reduction of\nthe amount of controversy from section 1331.\nTechnically we think the answer is yes, but it still\nhas great interpretive value because it shows that when\nCongress meant to address the jurisdictional question\nin title VII, it expressly said so and it did so by\nconferring jurisdiction over all title VII claims.\nThe definition of employer, which is the\nrelevant issue here, does not itself speak in\njurisdictional terms and does not modify in any way\ntitle VII's broad jurisdictional provision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about the\nEEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for\nadministrative processing purposes?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. Well, as the Court has\nremarked on multiple occasions, the word jurisdiction\nis a word of many, many meanings, and the EEOC has\nnever said that it's a question of the subject matter\njurisdiction of the Federal courts. It was -- until\nabout 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC in an administrative\ncontext used the word jurisdiction to refer to the\ndefinition of employer, statutes of limitations, and a\nvariety of other matters that are clearly not subject\nmatter jurisdictional.\nBut after this Court held in Zipes that\nanother provision of title VII is not one of subject\nmatter jurisdiction, EEOC realized that its\nadministrative use of the broad term jurisdiction was\nconfusing. So 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC amended its\ncompliance manual and no longer refers to any of these\nquestions as jurisdictional. But I guess the key point\nis it never said it was on subject matter jurisdiction.\nAnd Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about\nwhether a threshold question of coverage could be\nconsidered different than another element of the cause\nof action. I think the important thing here is that\nthe place where Congress used the term person is in\nsetting forth what conduct is unlawful. Title VII says\nthat it shall be an unlawful employment practice for a\nperson to discriminate in various ways. So the way the\ndefinition is irrelevant is in setting forth the scope\nof unlawful conduct which is a quintessential merits or\ncause of action inquiry as opposed to a jurisdictional\none.\nThe City of Kenosha is different because, as\npetitioner's counsel recognized, that interpreted not\nsection 1331 but section 1343 which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Interpreted section\n-- the use of the word person in section 1983.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Interpreted the word person in\nsection 1983 not to apply to municipal corporations,\nbut with respect to the jurisdictional inquiry, it said\nthat the -- that 1343 did not confer jurisdiction.\nIn Mt. Healthy several years later, the Court\nheld that although section 1343 was narrowly limited to\nactions that are quote, authorized by law, which\nconnoted somewhat of a merits inquiry, section 1331's\njurisdictional provision is not so limited and is not\nlimited by the definition of person, which is what the\nCourt held in section 1331.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So City of Kenosha\nwas just kind of a silly waste of time.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 1331 was applicable\nthere as well. Right?\nMR. JOSEFFER: At the time section 1331 had\nthe amount in controversy requirement, and I think\nthat's why now that section 1331 no longer has the\namount in controversy requirement, this Court's section\n1343 cases have more or less petered out because\nplaintiffs can now just go under section 1331.\nAnd Justice Scalia, you asked about the --\nthe practical consequences. I agree there are three\npractical consequences, and from that perspective, it\nmakes little sense to believe that Congress would have\nthought that this requirement should be jurisdictional.\nThe first is whether the issue can be raised at any\npoint in the litigation. The second is who decides the\nissue, and the third is whether, after dismissal of the\nFederal claims, the State law claims must be dismissed\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\nAnd given that this is just one of many facts\nthat arises in determining whether a plaintiff can\nstate a valid title VII claim, it's hard to believe\nthat Congress would have thought that this is the one\nfact that should be raised at the end of the case\ninstead of at the outset where it can be adjudicated in\nan orderly manner with all of the other facts.\nAlso, common law juries have been deciding\nfor centuries whether a worker is an employee or an\nindependent contractor for purposes of agency and tort\nlaw. And since that is the ultimate dispute here, it\nseems remarkable to think that that's the one fact that\nCongress would say should not go to a jury.\nAnd similarly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What have\njuries been determining?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the question as to\nwhether there are 15 employees here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- turns on whether some\nworkers are independent contractors or employees. And\nfor agency law purposes, which becomes relevant in tort\nlaw in terms of vicarious liability, the question\nwhether someone is an employee or an independent\ncontractor is a -- is a longstanding jury question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the question was\nwhether the truck drivers counted as employees because\nif they did, they'd have enough?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. If the -- if the -- if\nthose -- if the delivery drivers were workers -- were\nemployees, there's no question there were 15 employees.\nSo the question was whether some workers count as\nemployees and whether a worker is an employee or an\nindependent contractor is -- is a longstanding question\nfor a jury when there's a disputed issue of -- of fact.\nAnd then the third consequence -- I mean,\nhere, there -- the jury rendered a verdict on the State\nlaw claims, found in favor of respondent on one,\npetitioner on the other. And it seems highly unlikely\nthat Congress would think that that jury verdict should\nbe vacated and the case retried in State court because\nthe defendant has 14 instead of 15 employees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the --\nthat's a consequence of a determination that it's\njurisdictional in any case. Right?\nMR. JOSEFFER: That's correct, and there --\nthere are circumstances --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if you had a\ncase where you didn't dispute that the issue was\njurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the\npendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that\nout. Right?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, but I think that's one\nreason that Congress does not ordinarily make\njurisdiction turn on those types of facts. In the\nadmiralty concept -- context that you recognized, it's\nnecessary to distinguish between admiralty jurisdiction\nand general Federal question jurisdiction. So Congress\nhad to distinguish in some way, and the way it did was\nby saying, well, is the alleged injury caused by a\nvessel in navigable waters or elsewhere.\nBut ordinarily when -- a distinction does not\nhave to be drawn like that. In section 1343, it was\nthe same because Congress didn't want that to be\nconflated with section 1331 at the time. When\njurisdiction does not necessarily turn on contextual\nfactors, Congress ordinarily just lets the broad\njurisdictional ground of section 1331 be a clear,\nsimple threshold inquiry so parties can determine\nthey're in the right court, and then the case can be\nproceeded -- can be litigated on the merits from there.\nJustice Kennedy asked whether a court could\nraise the issue on its own, even assuming that it's a\nmerits issue. And I think the answer is that although\nthe defendant waived the issue here and therefore has\nno right to insist that it be raised, most waiver\ndoctrines are discretionary, and therefore, courts\nretain some inherent discretion to overlook waivers in\nsome circumstances. That discretion would be greater\nat the outset of a case where a Federal court decided\nit should not be deciding a case than it would be once\na jury had already decided the case, which is what\nhappened here.\nFinally, respondent relies on a number of\nthis Court's title VII decisions for the proposition\nthat this requirement is one of subject matter\njurisdiction. The basic point is that this Court has\nnever opined in dicta or in holding on whether this\nrequirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction of\nthe courts. This Court's only title VII subject matter\njurisdiction case is Zipes which held that a\nrequirement was not jurisdictional because it was not\n-- did not textually modify title VII's broad\njurisdictional provision and in light of other relevant\ncanons of construction. And for precisely the same\nreasons, the definition of employer does not textually\nmodify the definitional provision and therefore it does\nnot limit the court's subject matter jurisdiction to\nadjudicate this claim either up or down based on its\nmerits.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I have\nnothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nJoseffer.\nMr. Prendergast, we'll now hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRETT D. PRENDERGAST\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nI have to start off by disagreeing with my\nlearned colleagues on at least three areas.\nFirst of all, Mr. Schwartz indicated that the\nplaintiff pled that the defendant Y & H was an employer\nin this matter. That is inaccurate. What the\ndefendant actually pled and which became the subject of\nthe subsequent post-trial motions was that the court\nhad jurisdiction, and when the matter of the number of\nemployees was raised, that was the pleading -- the\nallegation in the complaint that the plaintiff raised\nto say this issue has been waived. There was no\nspecific pleading in the complaint that said that Y & H\nqualified for the definition of an employer under title\nVII. There was no pleading that Y & H had 15 or more\nemployees for the 20 or more weeks that were necessary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was\nno allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your\nclient?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: There was an allegation,\nYour Honor, that the plaintiff was employed by the\ncompany, but there was no allegation that Y & H was an\nemployer as the term is defined in title VII.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was the word employer used\nin the pleadings?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I don't recall, Your Honor,\nwhether or not the word employer was used. I think it\nwas clearly stated that -- and -- and there's no doubt\nMs. Arbaugh was, in fact, employed by Y & H.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm just asking the\nreally formal question. Was the word employer used to\nrefer to your client at any point in the pleadings?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I'm -- I'm not sure, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have the complaint\nin --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: In the record, yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there an allegation that\nthe company, petitioner, or whatever it was -- that\nthey violated the act?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: There was an allegation,\nYour Honor, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right -- I guess that --\nthey must have thought that there were 15 or more\nemployees because otherwise you wouldn't have.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Right. And -- and\nnaturally, though, Your Honor, that was denied.\nThe -- the admission that the plaintiff\nrelied upon in the post-trial motions was the\nallegation that this Court has jurisdiction under title\nVII, under the relevant provision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was that denied?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: That was admitted. The\njurisdiction was admitted, and -- and in the post-trial\nmotions, that was the issue that the plaintiff hung\ntheir hat on to come back and say this issue is -- is\nestablished and stipulated. There was clearly no\nadmission that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You denied it. Then they\npresented evidence, and their evidence was A, B, C, D,\nE. And I guess then you presented some contrary\nevidence, and you didn't present any evidence that he\nwasn't an employer. So I guess the odds are he was.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Well, there was -- but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if the odds are he was,\nthey win in the absence of any evidence.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Justice Breyer, if an\nemployer -- and -- and I disagree with the position\nthat it's -- I -- I think it is an element of the\nmerits in addition to being an element of jurisdiction.\nBut if a plaintiff has that as part of their burden of\nproof, then the plaintiff naturally has to introduce\nevidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess maybe you could\nhave appealed on that point. So did you?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess it's waived\nunless it's jurisdictional. So we're back to the\njurisdictional question.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: And which we maintain that\nit is jurisdictional. I'm not sure, Your Honor,\nwhether or not there is, in fact, any waiver because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I never heard of a point on\nthe merits that if you -- you think you're right. It's\nright on the merits, the element of the offense. You\ndon't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you\ndon't raise that in the appeal.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor, we didn't\nraise it in the appeal, the reason being that while the\nmatter was still pending in the trial court, in\naddition to the motion to dismiss for jurisdiction,\nwhich was granted, there was a motion for a renewed\njudgment as a matter of law, which included the\nplaintiff's failure to maintain their burden of proof.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And did you win or lose on\nthat?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: That was dismissed as moot\nbecause of the jurisdictional issue, Your Honor. So\nwhether or not that is waived or not -- I agree with\nyou. It's not before this Court today, but I don't\nthink it's a matter that can be decided by this Court\neither. It's a matter, if this Court should decide\nthat it is a merits issue, that goes back to the trial\ncourt on remand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other aspects of\ntitle VII do you think are jurisdictional?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I think the other aspects\n-- and clearly, this has not been the subject of as\ngreat a research -- would be the other ones that\ndesignate the scope or the coverage of the act, for\nexample, especially as it relates to employer.\nAt least three circuit -- and in addition to\nexcluding small companies as employers, the act also\nincludes as -- excludes as employers private membership\nclubs, the Government, the United States, agencies of\nthe United States, wholly owned corporations of the\nUnited States, and also Indian tribes. At least three\ncircuit courts have held that Indian tribes and their\nstatus is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.\nThat's the Fifth Circuit in Thomas v. Choctaw, the\nTenth Circuit in Duke v. Absentee Shawnee Tribe, and\nthe Ninth Circuit in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do they hold that the\nplaintiff must allege the employer is not an Indian\ntribe? I'm over here.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Over here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I say in -- in those case\nthat you just cited, did they hold that the plaintiff\nmust allege that the employer is not an Indian tribe?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I don't think they got into\nthat matter, Justice Stevens. Instead, what they\nsimply decided was whether or not the -- the employer\nwas an Indian tribe. There was a question concerning\nsome of the structures and just the business\norganizations that the Indian tribes were using and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you interpret those\ncases as, in fact, holding that if there was a trial\nand a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against what\nturns out later to be an Indian tribe, that after the\ncase is taken up on appeal, the Indian tribe can have\nthe judgment set aside?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor, because\nthe -- the cases did clearly hold that the matter of --\nas an Indian tribe was a matter of subject matter\njurisdiction. And as a matter of subject matter\njurisdiction, it is completely established law that\nthat may not be waived. It may be raised at any time.\nSo --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it, in fact, come up\nin that posture in the case? It has already been\nmentioned that the word jurisdiction has many, too many\nuses. Did it -- did the question come up in the Indian\ntribe cases as it did here after the case was fully\ntried and after there was a jury verdict for the\nplaintiff?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor. Those were\ncases where there were motions to dismiss based upon\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When -- if -- if it's\nbrought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it,\nwhether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6),\nfailure to state a claim? It goes out either way.\nWhen it is consequential is when you bring it up, as\nyou did here, after you lose on -- at the trial.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I -- I think the effect\ncould be different when you raise it. I think there\ncan also be a difference in effect in how it will be\ntreated, even if it was promptly raised. I think, for\nexample, on a 12(b)(1) motion, I don't believe the --\nthe court is obligated to accept all the plaintiff's\npleadings. It's allowed to look outside the pleadings\nto actually determine the jurisdiction. Whereas, in a\n12(b)(6) motion, if the plaintiff says it's an Indian\ntribe, it's an Indian tribe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Prendergast --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- my problem with -- with\nyour -- your contention is that I don't know how it is\nthat you -- that you intuit that this one definition is\njurisdictional. I mean, the definition -- the -- the\n15 employee limit is -- is part of the definition of\nemployer in section 701.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are 13 other\ndefinitions in section 1701. For example, it defines\non the basis of sex. Now, if -- if you contest whether\na particular remark or a particular practice of the\nemployer was -- fell within that definition, was on the\nbasis of sex or not, would you say that the court had\nno jurisdiction?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Will you challenge -- well,\nwhy are you challenging jurisdiction when you're --\nwhen you're saying the -- the definition of -- of\nemployer has not been met, but you are not challenging\njurisdiction when you say the definition of on the\nbasis of sex has not been met. Why -- why pick on one\nrather than the other?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I think the distinction is\nsimilar to an Aldinger/Kenosha type distinction. And I\nthink the question goes back to it requires an\ninterpretation of whether or not Congress wanted to\ngive the lower Federal courts the type of jurisdiction\nbeing discussed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I -- I understand that.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's what it comes\ndown to.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But how do you know --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Well, how --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If both definitions in\nsection 701 --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: How -- how do you know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why does one of them\nexpress one thing and another not express --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Justice Scalia, the way you\nknow is because you look at the logical deductions that\ncan be drawn from the congressional statutes, as this\nCourt suggested in Aldinger.\nAnd with respect to the other definitions, I\ncannot speak categorically with respect to those other\ndefinitions because that's not the matter before this\nCourt. I can't suggest to this Court a wholesale\ngeneral policy of these definitions are jurisdictional\nand these definitions are not jurisdictional.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the practical\nconsequences of affirming here are severe in terms of\nhandling these cases. And we've pointed out in some\nrecent cases of ours that we've been a little sloppy in\nthe past in using the word jurisdiction. So it looks\nto me like there are many indicators that would point\nto not treating the 15 employee requirement as one of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Justice O'Connor, I would\nsay the -- the consequences of not affirming are even\nmore severe. Congress, in 1964, made a clear decision\nthat it wanted small businesses not to be burdened with\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it's entirely in\nthe hands of the defendant to raise some objection.\nWho knows better than the employer how many employees\nthe employer has had? I mean, it's totally within your\ncapacity to say, wait a minute --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: But one --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- we didn't have 15.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: -- one -- one of the -- one\nof the concerns, I believe, that Congress did have with\nrespect to small employers was the fact that in the\nterms of small employers, you are dealing with less\nsophisticated litigants, less sophisticated litigants\nwith less access to legal resources that bigger\ncompanies have.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Were you representing this\nemployer at the time?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor. I handled\nthis matter only post-trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's -- what's\nwrong with the rule? We're not dealing with article\nIII here. What's wrong with the rule that if Congress\ndoesn't put it in the jurisdictional section, it's not\njurisdictional?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would make the\nfuture cases a lot easier to decide.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I think that would be\ncontrary, however, Mr. Chief Justice, to the previous\nholdings of this Court where they say you do look to\nthe logical deductions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: -- and you look to all the\nstatutes. For example, petitioner makes note of Zipes,\nbut if -- if the jurisdictional statute is going to be\nthe be all and end all of -- of the analysis and the\ndiscussion, then Zipes would have merely looked and\nsaid, oh, well, the statute of limitations is not in\nthe jurisdictional provision. End of discussion.\nBut Zipes didn't do that. Zipes said we need\nto look at the -- the jurisdictional statute, the way\nit's structured. We need to look at congressional\nintent and the legislative history, how they referred\nto this matter. We need to look at our prior cases how\nwe referred to this matter.\nSo I think to say just, okay, let's look at\nthe jurisdictional statute -- one, I think there are\ntwo problems with it. One --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to Zipes?\nIn Zipes, the Court was faced with the -- the word\njurisdictional had been appended to the statute of\nlimitations. I think that was true of the way the EEOC\nspoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory\nand jurisdictional. And then the Court explained in\nZipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's\njurisdictional. You can have a rule that's rigid, but\nit doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction. And\nthat's what Zipes tried to explain. The Court in Zipes\nwas faced with a number of cases that had used that\nterm to describe the time in which you must bring the\naction, mandatory and jurisdictional.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But\nZipes also dealt with a legislative history where they\nreferred to it as a statute of limitations period.\nZipes also said, okay, we have other cases where we\nhave used the term jurisdictional, but more often than\nnot, we've referred to this as a limitations period.\nZipes looked at the whole context and said, yes, we're\nnot going to be held by a few random, maybe casual or\ncareless uses of the term jurisdictional, but we are\ngoing to look at the whole thing.\nHere, the legislative history has\ntraditionally referred to this as a jurisdictional\nprovision. The '72 amendments, which increase --\ndecrease the number of employees necessary from 25 to\n15, referred to it as an expansion of jurisdiction.\nThis Court has had the matter come up before it always\nin jurisdictional terms. This Court has referred to\nthis. EEOC has referred to it as jurisdictional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now we know it's\n-- EEOC has changed.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Seeing the errors of their\nways, I guess.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- now that we do\nhave Zipes, why should the number of employees be\ntreated any differently than that rigid time line in --\nin Zipes?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, I think the\nreason that the number of employees should be different\n-- treated differently is because we go back to the\nAldinger question, and the Aldinger question is this\nCourt has to decide did Congress want to give this type\nof jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a pendant\njurisdiction case. Wasn't Aldinger --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Aldinger dealt with a\npendant party issue, yes, Your Honor.\nKenosha, however, dealt with -- as the Chief\nJustice has indicated, Kenosha dealt with a definition\nthat excluded counties from section 1983 and that was\nfound to be implicitly brought into the -- the\njurisdictional grant for civil rights actions.\nSo I think the mere fact that something is or\nis not in the jurisdictional statute cannot be\ndeterminative because ultimately you do need to go back\nto the question of did Congress want to give this type\nof jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.\nMy question would be why would Congress seek\nto give this type of jurisdiction to the lower Federal\ncourts for a whole category of cases where, in the\nwords of this Court in Hishon, it has granted these\nbusinesses complete immunity from title VII?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you just used an\ninteresting word because there are litigants who can\nclaim complete immunity from liability, but that\nimmunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't\ngo to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. It has\nto be raised in those cases as a defense.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: True, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe difference, however, between the immunity in those\ncases and the type of immunity here that the Court\ntalked about in Hishon -- immunity for a police officer\nin a civil rights case with qualified immunity will\ndepend upon a police officer's particular actions in\nthat particular case. The police officer, in general,\ncan be sued under section 1983.\nThe immunity that's present here, with\nrespect to small employers, has no relationship\nwhatsoever to the actions of that employer. An\nemployer who employs 12 people at most can engage in\nthe most egregious employment discrimination and\nharassment possible, and the Congress of the United\nStates has said, as a policy matter, on balance we\nwould rather accept that kind of awful conduct because\nwe don't want to impose these burdens on small\nbusinesses.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or leave it to the States\nthat often do cover smaller shops.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor, or leave\nit to the States and let the States do it. But we\ndon't want the Federal Government to be intruding into\nthe operations -- into the culture of these small\nbusinesses, and that I believe is the difference\nbetween the immunity that you mentioned, the qualified\nor prosecutorial type immunity, which depends upon\nactions, and this immunity here which depends upon\nsimply the status of the defendant, the whole class --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that argument\ndoesn't apply to absolute immunity cases, and yet in\nabsolute immunity cases, once again, it's clear there's\njurisdiction. There's simply immunity. The immunity\ndoesn't depend on any particular facts.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: The absolute immunity,\nJustice Souter, that I'm most familiar with would be\nprosecutorial immunity. I think there can still be\nexceptions for prosecutorial immunity. I think a\nprosecutor, depending upon the type of actions he's\nengaged in, can still be subject to liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we have to determine\nwhether he's acting as a prosecutor. Sure. We have to\ndetermine whether the President was acting in a\npresidential capacity, but that's not the kind of fact\ninquiry that you were talking about with respect to the\nqualified immunity.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: It certainly -- yes, Your\nHonor, I will concede it's a different kind of inquiry.\nBut I -- I do think, though, here the categorical\nexclusion of small businesses is a clear indication of\ncongressional intent of what Congress wanted to have\nhappen.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't see why the\nsame argument can't be made with respect to\nprosecutors. It is clear that if -- if an individual\nis acting in a prosecutorial capacity and enjoys the\nappointment as a prosecutor, that at least the -- the\nsystem -- we're not necessarily talking about Congress\nhere. The system says there -- there should be, as a\ncategorical matter, an -- an immunity from prosecution.\nAnd yet, that does not go to subject matter\njurisdiction. And it seems to me that that is\nessentially the exact argument that you're making here,\nand I don't see why it should be any more sound here\nthan it would be in the absolute immunity case.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Another -- well, Your\nHonor, I'll offer another distinction then. The other\ndistinction is prosecutorial immunity and qualified\nimmunity, for that matter, are court-created entities\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: -- court-created defenses.\nAnd as this Court is well aware, this Court nor any\nother court has the power to define subject matter\njurisdiction. That is Congress' purview and power.\nOnly Congress can limit the court's jurisdiction and\ndefine the court's jurisdiction for the lower Federal\ncourts.\nHere, Congress has spoken with respect to\nsmall businesses. It's a different matter, I would\nsuggest, with respect to prosecutors, which is an\nimmunity that is -- is a product of common law and --\nand a judicial creation.\nI would also want to point out that --\nanother thing. The Solicitor General indicated that if\nyou look at the structure of the -- the liability\nsection, he implied that it just imposes the employer\ndefinition into the -- all the other causes of action.\nIn fact, it does not. It says, it -- it shall be\nunlawful for an employer to, and then it defines what\nis unlawful. So I think there again it's indicating a\ndifference between other elements of the cause of\naction and the employer relationship and the employer\nexistence under title VII.\nUltimately, what this boils down to is\nwhether or not small businesses are going to continue\nto receive the protection that Congress has indicated\nthat it wanted them to have.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why can't get they get\nthe protections through summary judgment?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I think they would be\noffered some level of protection, Justice Souter,\nthrough summary judgment. The problem is summary\njudgment offers its own unique hurdles to a defendant.\nAnd again, it's a difference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Among other things, you --\nyou've got to do it up front.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: It's -- it's a different\nstandard as well, Your Honor, because under summary\njudgment, a plaintiff has it within their capability --\nhave to view all the inferences in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, and -- and the small\nbusiness could end up being dragged into the litigation\nfurther and further than I think Congress intended.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- if we're worried\nabout dragging people into litigation, I presume\nCongress didn't intend, as a -- as a general matter, to\nallow the -- the situation that we've got here. One\nparty has been dragged through a piece of litigation\nand, having lost, has decided it wants to take another\nshot at getting out of the case. Surely you can't say\nthat was within the contemplation of Congress' intent.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, actually I -- I\nwould not have viewed it as outside of Congress'\ncontemplation or intent because Congress -- and I think\nthis is an important part of legislative history.\nCongress in 1990 enacted the ADA, and they adopted the\nemployer definition from title VII. And at the time\nthat Congress adopted title VII's employer definition\nfor the ADA, all but one circuit court had decided that\nthis was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. And\nif you decide something is a matter of subject matter\njurisdiction, you take with it the unfairness. And I'm\nnot going to contend that it's not sometimes unfair to\nparties, some of the consequences of subject matter\njurisdiction. But you take that with it when you\ndecide that it's a matter of subject matter\njurisdiction. And Congress in 1990 adopted for the ADA\nthe title VII definition. So it's implied that they\nunderstood what was going on.\nIn 1991, they -- they had the Civil Rights\nAct and amended and provided for jury trials in these\ntypes of matters. And again, Congress was aware of the\nstate of the law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My -- my point --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: And Congress did not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- my point is not --\nMR. PRENDERGAST: -- seek a change.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- my point is not that\nCongress in some specific sense, when it establishes a\njurisdictional requirement, does not intend the\noccasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue\nof treating that requirement as jurisdictional.\nMy point simply is that if we are in -- in a\nsituation in which it is not clear whether it's\njurisdictional or not, and the issue can be raised, in\neffect, up front effectively through summary judgment,\nand in the alternative, can be treated -- and -- as --\nas an ineffective fact element, and in the alternative,\ncan be left, in effect, forever to be raised as a\njurisdictional element. The fact that it can be\ntreated effectively up front is one reason to think\nthat Congress would probably have wanted that fact\nissue to be regarded not as jurisdictional but as\nelemental so that it can be gotten out of the way and\nthe parties are not going to go through entire trials\nonly to have the whole thing upset by a belated\njurisdictional argument. That's my only point.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and, Justice Souter,\nI understand that point. However, I -- I tend to\nbelieve that this is, after all, an aberration case.\nPetitioner has suggested and the Solicitor General has\nsuggested that businesses may tend to sandbag this\nissue. I simply do not believe that that is a\nrealistic danger at all. In this case, quite frankly,\nthe matter was overlooked, and that's how we ended up\nhere. But in most cases, these small businesses are\nnot going to be looking to spend a lot of money and go\nthrough a whole trial and then say, oh, well, I had my\nshot at it. Let me see. If -- if it doesn't work out\nnow, I'll get out as a matter of subject matter\njurisdiction. Most cases, small businesses are going\nto say, make this case go away from me as fast as you\ncan. And so I don't think that that's really much of a\ndanger to suggest that this is a pattern that's going\nto be repeated, especially after a decision from this\nCourt. If this Court, as we believe that it should,\ncomes down and holds that this is a matter of subject\nmatter jurisdiction, I think parties will raise the\nmatter and get it disposed of.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, it doesn't\nmake a whole lot of difference.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that helps your\ncase.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a\ndifference on the -- the -- does the categorization\nmake a difference on the relevant time of the inquiry\nfor the 15 employees? You have 16 employees when the\ndiscrimination takes place. By the time the lawsuit is\nfiled, you've only got 14. Does it matter whether\nthat's called jurisdiction or going to the merits?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I -- I believe that the --\nthe case law has uniformly held that you look at the\ntime of the discrimination to determine the number of\nemployees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even -- even if it's\na question of jurisdiction.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Even if it's a question of\njurisdiction, yes, Your Honor.\nAnd I do think ultimately, though, it does\nmatter because it does become a matter -- it doesn't\nmatter for the plaintiff. It doesn't matter for the\nplaintiff whether or not it's a matter of subject\nmatter jurisdiction or a matter of the merits because\nthe bottom line is they're going to lose in either\nevent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It certainly matters for\nplaintiffs in this situation.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: In this particular --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It certainly matters from\nthe defendant's point of view too. In many of these\ncases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been --\nas in this case, you have delivery drivers. You have\nowners whose wives are employed in the business.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: And, Your Honor, and I\nwould urge that those kind of matters that need to be\naddressed are best addressed by the court as opposed to\nby a jury. I think to the matter of determining\nwhether or not someone is a -- is an independent\ncontractor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: From the -- from the point\nof view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight\nthis case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have\nthis ace up my sleeve.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: I just -- Your Honor, I\nsimply do not believe a defendant would generally do\nthat because, as I pointed out in my brief, the problem\nwith that is if I'm representing the defendant, all\nright, and I'm going to defend my case on the merits\nand I know I got this 15 employee question here, I go\nto trial, let's suppose I win. I win at trial in\nFederal court. Subject matter jurisdiction can be\nraised by the plaintiff. Now, after I've won at trial,\nthe plaintiff stands up and says, oh, this court didn't\nhave subject matter jurisdiction. I get a do-over.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like a good\nreason why a court should think long and hard about\ncategorizing this as a question of subject matter\njurisdiction.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, but again, I --\nI simply don't believe that that's going to be a\nproblem that's going to come up. I think the\nimportance of -- of categorizing this as subject matter\njurisdiction is to avoid -- among other things, is\nadding another complicating factor to a jury trial\nbecause, if you make this a matter of the merits now --\ncounsel for petitioner describes in his brief extended\nhearings to determine the number of employees. We're\nnow -- if you make it part -- just a part of the\nmerits, now before you can get to the actual issue of\ndiscrimination, a jury is going to have to sit through\nand try to decide how many employees there were.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would be\nsimultaneous. The jury -- the jury would have that\nquestion. Didn't I understand the attorney for the\nUnited States to say this is typical of what juries\ndecide, was this person an independent contractor or an\nemployee?\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, I -- I heard\nthat argument as well. All I can say is given the\nnumber of factors that are laid out under, for example,\nthe Fifth Circuit law to determine whether or not\nsomebody is an independent contractor or an employee,\nthat seems to me to be more like the function of a\njudge than a jury because it's a matter of balancing of\nthe relevant factors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPrendergast.\nMR. PRENDERGAST: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schwartz, you\nhave 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHWARTZ: If there are no additional\nquestions, I -- I have nothing further.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think -- do you think\nit's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be\njurisdictional but an employer couldn't? I mean, it\nseems to me the two the questions are quite different.\nAn Indian tribe is always an Indian tribe. Right?\nAnd you're -- you're excluding -- just as a prosecutor\nis always a prosecutor. You're excluding a whole\ncategory of people. But you're -- you're not excluding\na category of employers here, are you? Because it's a\n-- it's a factual question, whether at the time of the\nalleged offense, the particular company was employing\nmore than 15 people. It isn't that this company\nforever has immunity.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, I agree with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- you're not\narguing for the Indian tribes here.\nMR. SCHWARTZ: As -- well, my -- I leave that\nto other people.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHWARTZ: But the -- I could -- in\nanswer to that question, I can see an interesting\nscenario where a plaintiff working for a casino on an\nIndian tribe, there might be a question of who the\nactual employer is. And -- and that could come up and\nthat would certainly involve some litigation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if the\npractice of law has returned to normal in New Orleans?\nMR. SCHWARTZ: No. It's -- it's a struggle\nsomewhat for jury pools. The State court in\nparticular, because it only covers Orleans Parish, is\n-- is really struggling with pulling in jurors. The\nFederal courts have a larger number of parishes to draw\nfrom.\nI'm actually still living in Atlanta.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
