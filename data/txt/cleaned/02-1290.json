KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit held in this case that the\nUnited States Postal Service may be sued for treble\ndamages under the Federal antitrust laws. The court of\nappeals fundamentally erred in this holding. Throughout\nthe nation's history, postal operations have been carried\nout by the United States Government itself, pursuant to\nthe express authorization in article I of the\nConstitution, for Congress to establish post offices and\npost roads.\nAs this Court explained in the Council of\nGreenburgh case about 20 years ago, the furnishing of\npostal services has historically been regarded as a\nsovereign function, indeed a sovereign necessity, to\npromote intercourse among the states and bind the nation\ntogether. Such functions of the United States Government\nare not regulated by the antitrust laws.\nIndeed, more than 60 years ago, in the Cooper\nCorporation case, this Court held that the United States\nis not a person for purposes of the antitrust laws.\nAlthough the precise question before the Court in that\ncase was whether the United States could sue as a\nplaintiff under section 7 of the Sherman Act, the Court\nnoted that the same word, person, is used to describe who\nmay be held liable as a defendant, either in a civil\naction or in a criminal prosecution.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, in your view, are there\nany instrumentalities of the United States that you think\ncould be considered a person under the Sherman Act?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think that there are\nno instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the\nUnited States Government itself that could - that could be\nheld liable. The word instrumentality is used in a - in a\nsomewhat vague sense, elastic sense, and I think it would\nbe necessary to look at the particular statute to see how\nmuch of a governmental character a particular entity has.\nQUESTION: Of course, I guess the court whose\njudgment we're reviewing thought that the change in the\nstructure of the Postal Service affected the nature of\nthat instrumentality.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It - it - it did, but the - the\ncourt of appeals was wrong on that. First of all, after\nthe - the court of - after the - this Court's Cooper\ndecision, a number of lower court decisions have held,\nbeginning with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the Sea-\nLand case involving the Alaska Railroad, that agencies of\nthe United States or instrumentalities just like the\nUnited States itself is not a person subject to the\nantitrust laws. The Ninth Circuit didn't -\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler - Mr. Kneedler, but I\ndon't think in that case there was - the question was\nraised whether the Alaska Railroad was an agent of the\nUnited States that would - would carry the immunity of the\nUnited States.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the - the - it was - the\nCourt regarded it as an - as an instrumentality, and in\nfact the - the Court there recognized that the railroad\nand the officials of the Government responsible for\nsupervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and\nthat, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing\ninjunctive relief. So the - the Court certainly focused\non the question that the Alaska Railroad and those\nresponsible for managing it were part of the United States\nGovernment.\nQUESTION: I didn't think it was a contested\nissue in - in that case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It may not have been contested,\nbut it - but it - the Court certainly addressed that\nquestion and then went on to hold that as an\ninstrumentality of the United States, the - the railroad\nwas not subject to suit under the antitrust law.\nQUESTION: Is the Postal Service subject to the\nAdministrative Procedure Act?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is not. It - it - Congress\nspecifically accepted it that there's - in section 410 of\nthe act, there's a very detailed enumeration of the\nprovisions that Congress did want and did not want to be -\nthe Postal Service to be subject to. But the - the\nimportant point for present purposes is that in 1970, when\nCongress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, it carried\nforward the essential governmental character of the Postal\nService, just as it had been up until that point.\nIn fact, section 101(a) of the act says that the\nUnited States - and I quote - the United States Postal\nService shall be operated as a basic and fundamental\nservice provided to the people by the Government of the\nUnited States. And then it says, the Postal Service shall\nhave as its basic function the obligation to provide\npostal services to bind the nation together.\nQUESTION: So you say it carried forward the -\nthe essential governmental character. What - what does\nthat consist of? Doesn't it consist of the nature of the\nentity, not just - just the - the tag? It can't just put\na tag on it and - and say it has an essentially\ngovernmental character. I thought that the - that the\npurpose of the reorganization was to make the Postal\nService function like a regular business.\nMR. KNEEDLER: In - in a - in a limited sense.\nCongress -\nQUESTION: Well, I'll - I'll qualify it. A\nregular business, a regular public utility -\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I - I -\nQUESTION: - which has - which has certain\nobligations, yes.\nmail service, just as a telephone company has to give\nuniversal telephone service. But on the other hand, the\nrest of their operations were supposed to be business-\nlike.\nMR. KNEEDLER: In the - in the description of -\nof how the Postal Service was to be operated carrying\nforward, the - the Congress repeatedly referred to the\nPostal Service as - as a governmental function, a public\nservice to be operated in a business-like way. But what\nCongress meant by that was to insulate the Postal Service\nfrom the prior political interference that had come up by\nimposing the duty on Congress to repeatedly raise rates\nand - and address services.\nQUESTION: Insulated from the Government.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not - but by -\nQUESTION: You're - you're saying on the one hand\nit's part of the Government, but on the other hand, what\nCongress wanted to do was to insulate it from the\nGovernment.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. By - by no means insulate it\nfrom the Government. The Postal Service - the governors\nof the Postal Service are denominated officers of the\nUnited States, so the people responsible for the Postal\nService are officers of the United States.\nQUESTION: Are they - are they removable by the\nPresident?\nMR. KNEEDLER: They're removable for cause.\nQUESTION: For cause. Just like the heads of\nindependent agencies.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but - but certainly the other\nindependent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and\nagencies like that are part of the United States\nGovernment performing a governmental function.\nQUESTION: Congress never said that they were\nsupposed to operate like a business, which was the purpose\nof the Reorganization Act.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Actually, in the - in the text of\nthe act itself, there - there is - there is not an express\ndirective that the Postal Service will be operated like a\ncommercial entity. What Congress had in mind was to - was\nto rationalize the internal operations of the Postal\nService, but it did not change any of the fundamental ways\nin which the Postal Service operated. It - it maintained\nthe postal monopoly, which, under the private express\nstatutes, about 80 percent of the revenues of the Postal\nService are - are protected by the private express -\nQUESTION: It - it did - it did retain that\nmonopoly and - and the Government's position here is that\nthe Postal Service has the power to extend that monopoly\ninto fields that the Government did not specifically\nconfer upon it, right? Because the Government's position,\nas I understand it, is not only that the Postal Service\ncan't be sued under the antitrust laws, but that the -\nthat the Postal Service is not subject to the antitrust\nlaws.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is not a person within the\nmeaning of the antitrust laws.\nQUESTION: So it can - it can go ahead and extend\nthe monopoly conferred by statute beyond the - the narrow\ncontext granted by Congress.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is not a - that is not a new\nfeature of the - of the Postal Service. As we point out\nin our reply brief, quoting this Court's decision in the\nEmergency Fleet Corporation case, there the Court pointed\nout, with respect to the Post Office, it said the Post\nOffice has since 1872 competed with bankers through money\norders, it competed with savings and loan association\nthrough savings accounts, which the Postal Service\noperated -\nQUESTION: Suppose there - suppose there were an\nactionable violation of the antitrust laws and there was a\nconspiracy between two private suppliers, and the Postal\nService, through some of its high officers, joined that\nconspiracy. Would there be any liability, individual\nliability, on the part of the officers of the Postal\nService?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure about that. The\nPostal Service itself would not be - would not be liable,\nand I - and I think if the - I guess it depends on what\none means by a - by a conspiracy as well, because if the -\nthe Postal Service has brought authority in procurement,\nfor example, to - it's exempt from some of the Federal\nprocurement statutes, but Congress granted it the\nauthority to have its own procurement arrangements. So if\nthe - if - if a - if the Postmaster General decides on a\nparticular procurement methodology that - that was alleged\nto be anti-competitive, I don't think that could be fairly\ncharacterized as a conspiracy, even -\nQUESTION: Is the private express statute still\nin effect?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is, it is, and that has - that\nhas not been changed, and the Court discussed that in the\nCalifornia Board of Regents case and other - and other\ndecisions of this Court. Really, the - all the Ninth\nCircuit relied upon in - in this case was the presence of\na sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act,\nwhich simply says that the Postal Service may sue and be\nsued in its official name.\nThere is a - there is virtually no discussion of\nthat provision in the legislative history of the act, and\nthe Ninth Circuit essentially said that because the Postal\nService may sue - may be sued in its official name,\ntherefore, it has - its sovereign character has been cast\noff and it can be sued just like a private party.\nThat - that analysis is in direct conflict with\nthis Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer, where the Court\nreversed a similar determination with respect to the FDIC,\nsaying that the Ninth Circuit had conflated what are two\nanalytically distinct questions. The first is whether\nthere is a waiver of sovereign immunity. We do not\ndispute that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity here\nunder the sue-and-be-sued clause. But the - the second\nand critical question here is whether the - the\nsubstantive law that the plaintiff relies upon provides an\navenue for relief.\nIn this case, that is the antitrust laws, and\nCongress has never amended the antitrust laws to make an\nagency or an entity of the United States Government\nliable. After the decision in Cooper - Cooper\nCorporation, Congress amended the Clayton Act to allow the\nUnited States to sue as a plaintiff if it's injured in its\nbusiness or property, but it did not do that by changing\nthe word person. It - it explicitly provided a cause of\naction for the United States as the United States, but it\ndid not, as the D.C. Circuit pointed out in the Sea-Land\ncase, amend the definition of person or otherwise make the\nUnited States or its constituent parts subject to the\nantitrust laws as a - as a defendant.\nQUESTION: What happens - I'm sorry, go on.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, is this - section 201 of\nTitle 39 says, there is established as an independent\nestablishment of the executive branch of the Government of\nthe United States the United States Post Office. Was that\nin the statute before the reorganization or is that part\nof the reorganization?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's part of the reorganization.\nThere was a Post Office Department before that was part of\nthe Cabinet, and what - what Congress wanted to do was to\ntake the post - postal operations out of the Cabinet and\nput them under - under the Board of Governors, who are\nofficers of the United States but not part of the Cabinet.\nAnd the - the phrase, establishment of the executive\nbranch, is used with respect to other undeniably Federal\nagencies, as we point out in our - in our brief, the OPM,\nOffice of Personnel Management, the Transportation Safety\nBoard.\nAnd I - I think it's just intended to make\nclearer that the Postal Service was not to be under the\nPresident's direct control, and in fact there were\nproposals to make the Postal Service a corporation, and\nCongress emphatically rejected that. And instead, as\nPresident Nixon proposed in - in submitting a proposal to\nCongress, the Postal Service would be constituted as an\nagency like the SEC or NASA or the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System. All of those entities are -\nare performing quintessentially governmental functions\nthat are not subject to the antitrust laws.\nQUESTION: If I get into a car accident with a -\nwith a postal delivery truck, do I sue the United States\nunder the Federal tort claims?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, yes, you do. And - and -\nit's - it's an important thing to - to be clear about in\nthe Postal Reorganization Act. Pervasively throughout\nthat statute, Congress treated the Postal Service as a\ngovernmental entity. The torts are subject to the Federal\nTort Claims Act.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, where does the money\ncome to pay the judgment? Is it -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Out of the - out of the Postal\nService fund, but that is a fund in the Treasury. There's\na separate provision -\nQUESTION: But it isn't the general judgment\nfund?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No - no, it's - no, it's not, but\n- but there are other - other situations in which\nappropriated funds from a particular agency are used to\nreimburse the judgment fund if there's a particular\nappropriation set aside for that purpose, so this is not a\nunique feature of - of the - of the Postal Act.\nBut if I could also mention, torts are subject\nto suit against the United States, but with respect to\ncontracts, Congress subjected the Postal Service to the\nContract Disputes Act. The Court of Claims held almost 20\nyears ago, soon after the act was passed, that the United\nStates itself could be sued under the Tucker Act based on\na breach of contract with the Postal Service, because of\nthe close connection between the Postal Service and the\nUnited States.\nThe Postal Service could be sued in district\ncourt in its own name under the sue-and-be-sued clause for\nbreach of contract, but the Court of Claims held that -\nthat the United States itself can be sued, and therefore\nis responsible for the contracts of - of the Postal\nService, and it -\nQUESTION: Could the United States sue - bring an\nantitrust suit as plaintiff on behalf of the Postal\nService?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We - we believe it could. It\nwould - it would be brought in its own name, but - but the\nUnited States - if the Postal Service, just like any other\nentity, purchased goods, for example, and was a victim of\n- of a - of a - of an antitrust violation, the United\nStates would be able to sue and - and collect treble\ndamages. That was the purpose of the Cooper Corporation\ncase, where there was a procurement of tires by a number\nof different Federal agencies, and Congress authorized the\nUnited States to bring a suit to recover for the injuries\nsustained to Federal agencies generally in that situation.\nQUESTION: Under this sue-and-be-sued clause, is\nit your position that there must always be a Federal\nstatute authorizing the suit before the post office has\nany substantive liability?\nMR. KNEEDLER: As a general rule, yes. There -\nbefore the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed though, it\nwas assumed that tort claims could be brought against\nFederal entities that had sue-and-be-sued clauses,\nalthough a lot of those were private corporations that\nwere instrumentalities, not - not Federal agencies. And\nalso with respect -\nQUESTION: So the sue-and-be-sued clause does\nhave some substantive force in some other cases?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's - it's been - it's unclear\nbecause back when they were first put in the - in the\nstatutes, the - the separation of a - the existence of a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity and the existence of a cause\nof action were - were not separated the way they are\ntoday. For example, under the - under the Tucker Act, a\nplaintiff can bring a breach of contract action against\nthe United States, even though there's no statute that\nspecifically provides a cause of action for breach of\ncontract. It's thought that - that the reference to\ncontracts in the Tucker Act is a sufficient basis for\nthat, and we -\nQUESTION: Does the Post Office have the power of\neminent domain?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It does, it does, and it has - it\n- it carries forward the power to investigate postal\noffenses, to - to - with appropriate authorization, to\nsearch the mails.\nQUESTION: There's a lot of -\nQUESTION: What about - what about inverse\ncondemnation? Supposing the post office takes property\nwithout the ability to pay for it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't know that the question has\narisen, but I - I would assume that a - a suit could be\nbrought against the United States under the Tucker Act on\nthe same theory that I mentioned with respect to a breach\nof contract by the Postal Service.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler -\nQUESTION: Don't - before we get off of eminent\ndomain, don't - don't a lot of state public utility\nentities have the power of eminent domain?\nMR. KNEEDLER: They - they do, and that -\nQUESTION: So that really doesn't determine what\n-\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think it's part of an\noverall pattern.\nQUESTION: And they're subject to the Sherman\nAct, of course.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. But it's part of an\noverall pattern. Congress does not lightly confer the\nright of eminent domain on - on Federal agencies, but it's\npart of a general pattern in which the United States -\nexcuse me, in which Congress treated the Postal Service as\na - as a governmental entity.\nI did want to point out one particular way that\nillustrates the - the way in which the antitrust laws are\nunsuitable here. The precise - this is - this is at\nbottom a routine - a routine procurement dispute. And as\nthe Ninth Circuit held in this case, the plaintiffs here\nhad a cause of action, in fact, brought one under the\nAdministrative Disputes Resolution Act that is essentially\na bid protest statute.\nAnd there are two features of that statute that\nare inconsistent with antitrust liability in this setting.\nFirst of all, Congress expressly provided that the\nstandard of review in such an action is the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard of the APA, meaning that the Postal\nService, like any other Federal agency subject to that,\nhas to have broad latitude -\nQUESTION: It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, this is\nan argument that you don't have an antitrust violation\nhere, but we're concerned with the problem of whether you\nhad a classic violation, say they agreed with somebody\nelse on the prices they would charge for advertising the\nOlympics or something like that, where you had a clear -\nhere you don't have it clear. I think it's arguable\nwhether the alleged violation - but that's not the issue\nbefore us.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, except - except to this\nextent. In - in virtually every direction you turn, in\nlooking on how - on how disputes involving the Postal\nService are handled, you find a governmental dispute\nresolution mechanism, and that - this was the point about\nthe -\nQUESTION: But what about a breach of -\ninfringement of patents, for example?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's - there's express\nauthorization for suing the United States for -\nQUESTION: And infringement of copyrights and so\nforth?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Same - same thing. Where Congress\nhas wanted to provide the United -\nQUESTION: Supposing there was a - one of these\nantitrust violations that involved abuses of patents in\norder to extend a monopoly or something like that, that\ncould be a classic antitrust violation. But you say there\nare other Federal remedies there?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There - there might be - there\nmight be remedies under some of the statutes mentioned\nhere. There - I mean, Congress has expressly subjected\nthe United States to suit under the Lanham Act, under the\ncopyright statute, under - under the trademark laws, under\nthe patent laws, but - and - and then there are these\nprocurement statutes that I mentioned that are applicable\nin this particular case. But in this case as well,\nCongress did not provide for treble damages. The only\nmonetary relief a plaintiff could get in this procurement\nsituation, as we point out in our brief under the\nAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act, is bid preparation\ncosts, not treble damages.\nQUESTION: What if - what if the Post Office buys\na lot of paper from somebody and doesn't pay for it?\nWhat's - what is the remedy of that person on a contract?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There would be an alternative\nremedies. Before the Contract Disputes Act was passed,\nthe Postal Service could have been sued itself in its own\nname under the sue-and-be-sued clause, or in the Tuck -\nunder the Tucker Act in the - in the Court of Claims. Now\nunder the Contract Disputes Act, Congress has made that\nstatute applicable to the Postal Service just as it has to\nother Federal entities.\nQUESTION: And that could be - that sort of an\naction could be brought under the Contract Disputes Act?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And there is specifically a\nPostal Service board of contract appeals, just there - as\nthere is a board of contract appeals in - in other\nagencies.\nQUESTION: Would there be an - some alternative\nremedy to the antitrust law if the Postal Service decided\nto use its profits from the monopoly business in effect to\nsubsidize predatory rates in the package delivery business\nin order to put UPS out of business?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The way - the way Congress\naddressed that was to subject the Postal Service to the\njurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, and all -\nQUESTION: Well, let's assume they go along with\nit. They say, okay, we are going to eliminate UPS. Would\nthere be any alternative claim - source of remedy by UPS\nto the antitrust laws?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I would - I would - if the -\na decision - it's a complicated mechanism the way the\nPostal Rate Commission interacts with the Postal Service,\nbut there is a provision for judicial review. If the\nPostal Service enters a final decision after - after\nreceiving the input from the Postal Rate Commission, there\nis a provision for judicial review of that - of\ndeterminations of -\nQUESTION: What would be the -\nMR. KNEEDLER: - rates and classifications.\nQUESTION: What would be the substantive basis\nfor the review?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Under - under the Postal\nReorganization Act, the provisions beginning in - in\nsection 3601 of the act address rate-making and\nclassification, and there are specific standards there\nthat the Postal Rate Commission and the Postal Service\nmust adhere to.\nQUESTION: And - and would it eliminate this\npossibility of predatory lowing - lowering rates for -\nMR. KNEEDLER: They - they are designed to. The\n- the - the way the - the way the act operates, it\nspecifies that each classification - first - two things:\none, overall, the Postal Service rates are to be set at a\nrate so that they - the income will roughly equal\nexpenditures. And then within each class, Congress has\nprovided the direct and indirect costs of that class are\nto be allocated to it, along with some - an appropriate\nportion of the institutional costs, the things that are\ndifficult to - to allocate to any one - any one class.\nQUESTION: Of course, this only becomes a real\nproblem when the Postal Service turns a profit on its\nmonopoly business, which it has not yet succeeded in\ndoing, has it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, and - and it's not - over\nthe long term, over the long term since the Postal\nReorganization Act, I believe that the Postal Service is\nwithin about a billion dollars of breaking even. There\nare times when it is in a deficit. There are times when\nit is in a surplus, but the statutory goal is that it -\nthat it be roughly equal balance between - between income\nand expenditures.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a basic\nquestion I just kind of forgotten that I thought I knew\nabout, but I thought the Postal Service had a monopoly of\nthe business of delivering letters and packages, and that\nthese competing services are only allowed to exist by some\nspecial privilege granted by the Postal Service.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That's true for letters, but\nnot for parcel post.\nQUESTION: But not for parcel, I see.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. There's - there's an - the\nPostal Service adopted an exception to the private express\nstatutes for urgent letters, which - which has allowed\norganizations like Federal Express to carry letters for\nurgent delivery. Absent that exception, they would - that\npractice would be prohibited by the - by the private\nexpress statutes.\nBut the - the idea that the Postal Service\ncompetes with non-Federal entities is not new. As I - as\nI pointed out, the Postal Service began competing with\nmoney orders before the turn of the last century, for 50\nyears have had savings deposits with up to 4 million\ndepositors that competed with savings associations, so and\n- and it's competed - it went into the parcel post\nbusiness, the parcel delivery business in 1913 alongside\nof other businesses.\nSo that - that sort of competition with private\nbusinesses has - has occurred since well before the Postal\nReorganization Act, and nothing in the Postal\nReorganization Act changes the way in which that should be\nregarded under the - under the antitrust laws.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Krent, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD J. KRENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. KRENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nAs Justice Scalia noted, Congress launched the\nPostal Service into the commercial world in 1970,\nauthorizing it to compete in any market of its own\nchoosing, and this new commercial entity fits comfortably\nwithin the term, person, under the antitrust laws for at\nleast four distinct reasons.\nFirst, this is unlike any other Federal entity\nin the fact that the Postal Service has been authorized to\ndecide which markets it wants to compete into. It's not\ncompeting in order to fulfill a specific congressional\nmission, but rather to compete in order to break even to\nmake money.\nSecond, Congress has directed the Postal Service\nenter these markets with scant regulatory oversight. The\nAPA, the Postal Rate Commission, the Federal acquisition\nregulations, all do not apply when the Postal Service is\nacting under its non-monopoly powers.\nQUESTION: You're saying then that the Cooper\ndecision doesn't affect your argument, because the - the\nCongress has separated the Post Office Department from the\n- from the executive?\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor. And in\nmany other contexts, though, it's clear that this Court\nhas recognized that the Postal Service should be distinct\nfrom the United States, the Franchise Tax opinion, the\nLoeffler decision, and I think the other -\nQUESTION: Well, neither of those are quite in\npoint.\nMR. KRENT: Neither are involved in separate\ncause of action, but both involve this Court's recognition\nthat the Postal Service is not the same as United States\nand should be treated differently.\nQUESTION: But what do you do with the statutory\nlanguage that it's an establishment of the executive\nbranch of the Government of the United States?\nMR. KRENT: Well, I think it is an establishment\nof the executive branch, and it keeps some kind of\nconnection to the United States, and so, for instance,\nCongress evidently cared about the fact that, given the\nmonopoly given over letter mail, that there would be some\ntie. I mean, the - the President cannot, can neither\nappoint nor discharge the Postmaster General, but yet\nthere is some link between the President and the Postal\nService. Yet financially, the Postal Service is\nindependent.\nQUESTION: There isn't any Postmaster General\nanymore, is there?\nMR. KRENT: Well, there - there is, Your Honor,\nin terms of the individual who's so-called under the\nstatute the executive official of the - of the United\nStates, and that individual is to - is also a member of\nthe Board of Governors of the Postal Service and is to\ndirect and execute the business operations of the Postal\nService.\nQUESTION: How is he selected? By the Board of\nGovernors?\nMR. KRENT: Chosen by the Board of - yes, Your\nHonor. And I think that, again, Evans is the separation\nor the insulation of the Postal Service from direct\nexecutive branch control. But financially, as I\nmentioned, the debts of the Postal Service are not the\ndebts of the United States. Any kind of - of recovery\nagainst the Postal Service does not come from the judgment\nfund, it comes from the Postal Service fund. Again, these\ntwo things reflect the fact that the budget, as well as\nthe overall financial structure of the Postal Service, is\nindependent.\nAnd - and the fourth reason, Your Honor, of why\nthe Postal Service is a distinct entity is - is the fact\nthat there is a sue-and-be-sued clause that differentiates\nthis case from the Sea-Land case, in which there was no\nsue-and-be-sued clause.\nQUESTION: It doesn't differentiate though from\nthe Meyer case?\nMR. KRENT: No, Your Honor, and indeed, we think\nthough that the - these four factors together amply\ndemonstrate that this is a - there is a congressional\nintent that the Postal Service be considered a separate,\ndistinct entity that can qualify under the term, person,\nin antitrust laws. And indeed, this is not an unadorned\nsue-and-be-sued clause. Congress sat and thought about\nthe ramifications of the sue-and-be-sued clause and\nthought about what specific limitations should be grafted\non to the waiver of immunity. It decided to make sure the\nPostal Service complied with the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nIt wanted to make sure that the Postal Service, despite\nthe distinction with the United States, viewed its own -\nhad different venue - had the same venue.\nQUESTION: But Meyer says you have to have\nsomething more than a sue-and-be-sued clause, that you\nhave to show that there's a cause of action available. So\na sue-and-be-sued clause itself is not enough for you in\nthis case, don't you agree with that?\nMR. KRENT: I agree, Your Honor, and indeed it's\nthe fact that the antitrust laws say that every person\nshould be subject to the anti-competitive measures, or\npro-competitive measures, in - in the statutes.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but the - that was true -\nthey said that in the Cooper case too, that person, and\nthe Cooper Court said, no, the United States is not a\nperson.\nMR. KRENT: That's right, Your Honor, but I think\nthe Cooper case must be looked at in the structure of the\ndecision itself, because the Cooper Court was very clear\nto limit its decision. It said that person did not equal\nUnited States because of the fact that there were other\nremedies given to the United States explicitly in the act,\nand indeed, that that conformed to -\nQUESTION: But certainly after the Cooper\ndecision, it was clear that the United States could not be\na defendant either, was it not, as well as not be a\nplaintiff -\nMR. KRENT: Well, it didn't matter Your Honor,\nbecause there was no waiver of immunity.\nQUESTION: Well, answer my question, will you?\nMR. KRENT: I believe that it was clear, because\n- but, again, I think that nobody tried to avail\nthemselves of that remedy because the United States had\nnot waived its immunity. But this Court extended the\nnotion of the - of person, and to as broad as possible,\nincluding states, including foreign governments, as well\nas associations and public corporations.\nQUESTION: Didn't the Court say in Cooper, the\nreason why we're not letting the United States be a person\nas plaintiff, because if we did that it would follow like\nthe night day that they would be a person as a defendant,\nand we certainly don't want them to be a person as a\ndefendant? So that's right in the -\nMR. KRENT: Well, we have no quarrel -\nQUESTION: That's right in the opinion. It's not\nsomething subtle. One of the driving forces for saying\nthey couldn't be - they weren't going to read into the act\nplaintiff status was that this Court thought that would\nmean they would be a person for defendant status.\nMR. KRENT: I agree that it's in the opinion,\nYour Honor, but this Court, in Georgia v. Evans, and this\nCourt in Pfizer, made clear to cast the Cooper decision in\nthe light of the fact that it was a narrow decision,\npredicated not specifically on that point, Your Honor, but\nrather on the notion that there was an election of\nremedies, the fact that the United States could sue to\nseize property under the act, the United States could\npursue criminal penalties under the act, and that\nlinguistically, the United States doesn't seem to fit in\nwithin the terms, an organization or association existing\nunder the law as the United States.\nQUESTION: Well, the - what, the Postal\nReorganization Act was 1970? Have any other antitrust\nsuits been brought against the Postal Service in that 34\nyears?\nMR. KRENT: Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.\nHowever, the Department of Justice in 1977 and again in\n1978, made findings suggesting that the Postal Service was\nlikely to be subject to the antitrust laws.\nQUESTION: That's no longer the position of the\ndepartment, is it?\nMR. KRENT: That's correct. It was soon after\nthe enactment of the 1970 statutes. And indeed, there are\nother entities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority,\nwhich has been found to be a person under the antitrust\nacts, but I think it's - the fact that this is rising,\nthis question arises under the Postal Services is no\nsurprise, because the Postal Service has a roving mandate\nto decide to go into the business of greeting cards in\ncompetition to Hallmark, to go into the fact that it can\nsell bicycling gear, to go into the market of the package\nindustry, to go into the market of calling cards and\ncompete against AT&T.\nThere is no other Federal entity to my knowledge\nwhich has this kind of roving mandate to make money from\nCongress, and indeed, it has used this ability -\nQUESTION: Well, it's an -\nQUESTION: It didn't - excuse me - I didn't think\nit had a mandate to make money. I thought the statute had\nordered it to break even.\nMR. KRENT: Well, it has a statute - it - it's -\nit's a rough balance. It's unclear whether it's supposed\nto make a little money or lose a little money.\nQUESTION: But it - but it's unlike most profit-\nmaking institutions that are primarily engaged in trying\nto make as much money as they can.\nMR. KRENT: That is correct, Your Honor, but in\nthe non-postal activities, the only objective is to make\nmoney. Certainly for universal service there are other\nobjectives limiting and channeling the actions of the\nPostal Service, but with respect to selling bicycling gear\nor selling greeting cards, the only objective the Postal\nService has is to make money, and it has tried to use this\npower, and indeed, there were surpluses, as mentioned by\ncounsel for the Solicitor General, in several years. So\nthe Postal Service can be successful at least at times,\nbut other times, of course, especially after 9/11, it has\nseen hard times.\nQUESTION: But even - even when it is, I take it\nthe object of the money that it makes is essentially to\nbreak even, maybe break even and a little bit more, on -\non the mail delivery operation, which the statute itself\nrecites as being a sovereign responsibility of the United\nStates.\nMR. KRENT: Well, I think that's -\nQUESTION: So, I mean, that's - that's a long way\nfrom General Motors.\nMR. KRENT: I think it - it's - there is no\nshareholders, for instance, looking for a profit, but the\ngoal of the Postal Service in these other areas of\nbusiness, whether it's the package business or the\ngreeting card business, is to make money.\nQUESTION: Well, it is to make money, but it is\nto make money in order to subsidize a particular activity,\nand I don't think - maybe I'm missing something - but I\ndon't think there's an indication that there's a mandate\nthere to maximize profits to in - in effect subsidize the\nrest of the Government.\nMR. KRENT: Not - not the rest of the Government\nat all, because there is a segregated fund. But it is\nthere to - to make sure that any kind of losses that the\nPostal Service may sustain in its monopoly business can be\novercome by profits generated in the non-monopoly\nbusiness.\nQUESTION: And that monopoly business is\ndescribed in the statute as being the discharge of a\nsovereign obligation of the United States, isn't it?\nMR. KRENT: Absolutely. The - the Congress has\nbeen very clear that there is a monopoly business to be -\nto be pursued here, and the Postal Service is pursuing\nthat. But that's not what the Postal Service is only\nabout. The Postal Service is also constructed as a\nbusiness, and that's what this Court has recognized in\nFranchise Tax and in Loeffler case, and according to that\nbusiness principles, is pursuing other tasks as well.\nIndeed, Congress -\nQUESTION: What is - what is the - what is the\norganizational form of this business? It's not a\ncorporation, is it?\nMR. KRENT: It's a corporation-like form, Your\nHonor, and indeed -\nQUESTION: Well, but it's not a separate\ncorporation.\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor. I mean,\nthe Postal Service has described itself as a corporation.\nQUESTION: Is it - is it a partnership?\nMR. KRENT: It's - it's a board of directors-\ntype organization with the Board of Governors serving as a\ntype of Board of Governors - as a board of directors - and\nthe Board of Governors, as mentioned earlier, chooses the\nhead or the chief executive officer of, or the Postmaster\nGeneral, of the Postal Service itself.\nQUESTION: But the structure, I take it, is\nunlike anything that one would find in - in a - in a\nprivate profit-making organization.\nMR. KRENT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It's not a corporation, not a\npartnership.\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, it is - has a distinct\nstructure, but I think that the Congress that launched the\nPostal Service in the business and suggested that the\nPostal Rate Commission, the APA, and the Federal\nacquisition regulations wouldn't apply, would not have\nwanted then the Postal Service to use any kind of monopoly\npowers to have a tying arrangement with an entity such as,\nyou know, Emery Air Freight or Federal Express, it\nwouldn't wanted to have -\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't this the kind of\npolicy judgment that we ought to leave to Congress to make\nexplicitly? The Post Office, as reorganized, has two\naspects to it, as you've pointed out effectively, but how\nit should relate to the Antitrust Act seems to be the kind\nof judgment that Congress should address expressly. Isn't\nthat so?\nMR. KRENT: I think, Your Honor, that the\nCongress has already made that judgment by suggesting that\nthe Postal Service have the right to be sue and be sued,\nsuggesting the Postal Service -\nQUESTION: Well, I thought we had already\ndiscussed that. I mean, the mere fact that there's a sue-\nand-be-sued clause is not enough under the Meyer approach\nto answer the question. You have to -\nMR. KRENT: Sure.\nQUESTION: - take another step -\nMR. KRENT: Right. The -\nQUESTION: - beyond that.\nMR. KRENT: Sure, Your Honor. The question is\nwhether or not the Postal Service fits within the term,\nperson. We know under the antitrust laws, we know that\nperson can be applied to public corporations, as this\nCourt has held. We know that person can be applied to\nstates, as this Court has held. We know that person can\nbe applied to foreign governmental entities, as this Court\nhas held. So the only question is whether this person can\nalso apply to Federal governmental entities, and we think\nthat it's clear that some, but very few, governmental\nentities would qualify under the term, person.\nQUESTION: But you - you - you concede that\nbefore the Postal Reorganization Act, the answer to the\nquestion would be no?\nMR. KRENT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: So you - you have to - I mean, you're\n- you're not writing on a blank slate. You - you have to\nfind enough in the Postal Reorganization Act to change\nthat answer from no to yes, and that's really the burden.\nMR. KRENT: I - I agree, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Given that the Postal Service was not\nsubject to the antitrust laws before, something so\nfundamental happened in 1970 that it is now a person under\nthe antitrust law. That's - that's your -\nMR. KRENT: I fully agree with that.\nQUESTION: - your burden.\nMR. KRENT: I full agree with that, and I think we can\ndischarge that burden if you look at the fact that the\nPostal Service is financially independent, it's\nadministratively independent, it doesn't have to comply\nwith the pro-competitive measures and the Federal\nacquisitions regulations, it has a sue-and-be-sued clause.\nQUESTION: But its employees, are its employees\nsubject to the Taft-Hartley law, or - or - or are they\nlike - like Federal workers?\nMR. KRENT: They are the only employees in the\nentire government to my knowledge that must comply with\nthe Taft-Hartley law, and indeed, Congress specified that\nit must comply within the law, because it wanted them to\nact more like a business and not have this restrictures of\nother organizations within the United States as they -\nfollowing the fellow labor relations authority, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: So - so - would - would their\nemployees be members of the American Federation of\nGovernmental Employees or other unions?\nMR. KRENT: I believe it's the American Postal\nWorkers Union, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Postal workers union?\nMR. KRENT: Yes. So it's a - it's a separate -\nthey're separated again from the Government with respect\nto labor relations. And indeed, they are one of the few\ngovernmental entities that have signified their own\noperations under www-dot - dot-com. All right, they have\ndecided not to become a governmental player.\nQUESTION: But of course, the Reorganization Act\nitself specified that they'd be subject to Taft-Hartley,\ndid it not?\nMR. KRENT: That's correct. And that's part and\nparcel, I think -\nQUESTION: So why didn't it specify that they\nwould be subject to the Sherman Act?\nMR. KRENT: Because -\nQUESTION: You see, I - I don't think that helps\nyou, I think it hurts you.\nMR. KRENT: I don't -\nQUESTION: It - it is a significant feature that\n- that the - their employees are subject to Taft-Hartley,\nbut that - that is more than answered by the fact that it\nsays so in the Reorganization Act. Why doesn't it say so\nabout the - about the antitrust laws?\nMR. KRENT: Well, I think it's important to think\nabout what the Postal Reorganization Act does say. When\nit waives immunity, it makes limitations. The limitations\nare that the Postal Service must comply with the\nlimitations in the Federal Tort Claims Act, that it has a\ndifferent - the same venue provisions as by the United\nStates, and that it has some of the jurisdictional\nqualities as the United States, though the - so the\nlimitations and ramifications of the waiver are grafted in\nsection 409 very clearly. There is no other limitation,\nand I think it's important to realize -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but there's one - one sticking\npoint that - running through my mind. The fact that they\nhad to waive the immunity in the sue-and-be-sued clause\nsuggest that they're a sovereign.\nMR. KRENT: We agree that they're part of\ngovernment, Your Honor. There's never been any kind of\nquestion about the fact that the Postal Service is part of\nthe Government.\nQUESTION: And is a sovereign.\nMR. KRENT: And - yes, Your Honor. And it takes\n- takes part of the - in the - in the sense that it would\nhave immunity, but for the waiver, clearly because\nCongress created the entity, and therefore Congress\ndecides whether to waive the immunity.\nQUESTION: Of course, if you're right, they're\nsubject to criminal liability under the Sherman Act too.\nMR. KRENT: Well, so are states theoretically, as\nwell as cities. I don't think that would ever arise, but\nthat is at least a theoretical possibility and this Court\nhas averted to that in prior decisions as well. The same\nthing is true, of course, for cities under -\nQUESTION: A criminal case with the United States\nagainst the United States Postal Service.\nMR. KRENT: Well, I don't think that's likely to\nhappen, Your Honor, but I think it's important that this -\nthis waiver allows the Postal Service also to vindicate\nits own interests, right. But for this waiver, Postal\nService could not go in and sue for any kind of antitrust\ninjuries, and that's not clear.\nQUESTION: But Congress could have said the\nPostal Service is authorized to sue and omitted the be-\nsued clause. It could have done it that way -\nMR. KRENT: That -\nQUESTION: - in which there would have been no\nwaiver.\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor. That\nwould have made this case go away. But Congress chose not\nto follow that path, and indeed, if one could think that\none launches a - an organization into the commercial\nmarketplace and takes away the constraints of the APA, the\nFAR, the Postal Rate Commission -\nQUESTION: Well, to say launch into the\ncommercial marketplace, they're basically selling stamps\nand nobody else is selling stamps. What kind of a\nlaunching is that?\nMR. KRENT: Well, I think it's now for the\nmonopoly business, Your Honor, but the launching with -\nwith respect to the package delivery business, the\ngreeting card business, the fact that they are sponsoring\nLance Armstrong's bicycling team, these are all the areas\nin which the Postal Service has decided to venture outside\nof its mandate, and it's - the danger is allowing the\nPostal Service to extend its monopoly power into these new\nfields.\nQUESTION: Mr. Krent -\nQUESTION: But when it goes into all those fields\nanyway - we've made this point about 15 times - it - it\ndoesn't set the prices it wants. It sets prices\ncontrolled by a commission under a mandate that says it's\nsupposed to break even.\nMR. KRENT: No - no - if I understand your -\nQUESTION: Isn't that right?\nMR. KRENT: That's not right, Your Honor. In\nterms of all these different areas, the Postal Rate\nCommission does not operate whatsoever.\nQUESTION: It has no - in greeting cards and so\nforth?\nMR. KRENT: No jurisdiction. The Postal Service\n-\nQUESTION: So is it - it - and it's free? In\nother words, it doesn't - it isn't - well, you - I thought\nyou answered Justice Souter by saying that they do have an\nobligation even there to break even overall?\nMR. KRENT: Oh, overall, Your Honor, but the\nPostal Rate Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever on\nthe Postal Service's actions with respect to greeting\ncards, bicycling gear, and the package delivery business.\nAnd I think that points out the danger of the monopoly\npractices. One could easily see -\nQUESTION: So if in - in the greeting card\nbusiness, they decided to go into an agreement with three\nother companies, Hallmark and Smith's greeting cards, and\nthey were to fix their prices at $14 a greeting card,\nwhich seems about right nowadays -\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: - the - the - then under those\ncircumstances, there would be no remedy -\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - for the consumer of the stores.\nThere's no government agency anybody could appeal to?\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. So that's -\nMR. KRENT: Absolutely none. And indeed, if\nthere was a tying arrangement of trying to say, if you\nwant our postal services then you have to buy our greeting\ncards, to follow your example, no remedy whatsoever there\nas well, so that all these kinds of fear of predatory\npricing, tying arrangements, monopolistic prices, the -\nthere's a danger -\nQUESTION: Well, but there - there wouldn't be a\nremedying as the Postal Service, but I assume you could\nsue American Greetings and Hallmark and whoever else had\nconspired with the Postal Service.\nMR. KRENT: You might, unless it was a tying\nagreement, Your Honor.\nunilateral action of the Postal Service with a tying\narrangement, there would be no remedy.\nQUESTION: If it was unilateral action, they'd\nbe -\nQUESTION: We won't sell you any stamps unless\nyou buy our greeting cards?\nMR. KRENT: You never know. One never knows.\nQUESTION: It might happen, I suppose.\nQUESTION: Mr. Krent, can we go back to Sea-\nLand, where I thought that the first point made in that\ndecision was indeed as a result of the change in the APA\nthat Alaska Railroad could be sued for injunctive relief.\nThe Court said, yeah, they could be sued like any person,\nnot for damages, but for injunctive relief. And then it\nsaid, but this is the question of whether Congress\nauthorized them to be a defendant in an antitrust case is\na totally discrete question, it has nothing to do with the\nwaiver of sovereign immunity.\nMR. KRENT: Well, indeed, that - that's right,\nYour Honor, and indeed, the difference in - in Sea-Land is\nthe fact that the Alaska Airlines never had a - never had\nto argue that they were separate from the United States.\nTheir argument was that the United States could be sued\nfor its proprietary activities under the Sherman Act.\nThey didn't argue that they were a distinct entity, so\nthey never said that - there was no - they agreed that\nthere was no sue-and-be-sued clause, and so that whole\nargument that we're making in this case was never even\nraised in Sea-Land.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm - from the Court's point of\nview, it - the Court made as a threshold determination\nthat the railroad could be sued for equitable relief, so\nit could be sued. And then it says, but that doesn't\nanswer the question, we have to determine whether there is\na claim, any claim under the antitrust laws, and on that\nthe Court relied on Cooper.\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor, because\nof the Court's holding that the Alaska Airlines did not\nqualify under the term person under the antitrust laws.\nAnd it's our contention, because the Postal Service is not\nstructured anywhere like the Alaska Airlines, because it's\n- Alaska Airlines did not have a separate budget, the\nAlaska Airlines could not sue and be sued, the Alaska\nairlines had to comply with the APA, unlike the Postal\nService, that the Postal Service is a person, whereas the\nAlaska Airlines and the SBA and the Department of Commerce\nand HUD would not be persons under the antitrust law. So\nit's a very narrow argument predicated on the structure -\nQUESTION: Eleven people running this, nine of\nwhom were appointed by the President of the United States,\nI take it that's your -\nMR. KRENT: I'm sorry -\nQUESTION: I take it that the directors are\nappointed by the President of United States, almost all of\nthem.\nMR. KRENT: Except for the Postmaster and the\nDeputy Postmaster.\nQUESTION: All right. So nine out of the eleven\nare appointed. Are they confirmed by Congress?\nMR. KRENT: By the Senate, sure.\nQUESTION: Yes, all right. So - and they're\nrepresented by the Solicitor General, and their license\nplates have government on them.\nMR. KRENT: Well, I've never seen their license\nplates, your Honor, but I'm -\nQUESTION: But, I mean, and - and they say that\nthey're part of the Government, and 80 or 90 percent of\nwhat they do is not what private industry does at all and\nyou have remedies against all of it except - under other\nstatutes or powers of review within the Government, except\nfor a small portion, I take it it is a small portion, this\ngreeting card business.\nMR. KRENT: Well, we're focusing on the 20\npercent we agree -\nQUESTION: All right, then, so you're - in other\nwords, I thought you were selling them sacks, you wanted\nto sell them burlap sacks.\nMR. KRENT: Well, they're not burlap, but yes,\nthey are -\nQUESTION: Well, whatever they are -\nMR. KRENT: - they are sacks.\nQUESTION: - they're some kind of sack.\nMR. KRENT: Sure.\nQUESTION: Aren't they used for mail?\nMR. KRENT: They are used for international mail,\nfor third-class mail.\nQUESTION: All right, so - and they make\ntreaties, by the way, too. I don't know that General\nMotors now can make a treaty.\nMR. KRENT: I agree with you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right, so - so it wouldn't help\nyou if we said that in the vast bulk of their business\nwhere they have all of these characteristics I just\nmentioned -\nMR. KRENT: Well, I think it would, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - that it - it would help you? How?\nMR. KRENT: I think it would because I think the\nargument here -\nQUESTION: They're selling the sacks for the\ngreeting cards too?\nMR. KRENT: I think that what - actually that\nthey probably do, but the - the - the gravamen here is\nthat there was a conspiracy to monopolize the mail sack\nbusiness, as well as the -\nQUESTION: Of course there was. Don't they have\na right to monopolize the mail sack business or not? Isn't\nthere some -\nMR. KRENT: No.\nQUESTION: They don't?\nMR. KRENT: We don't believe that's part of the -\nthe monopoly -\nQUESTION: Statute. Then why don't you go to the\ncommissions that run them and tell them they can't do it?\nMR. KRENT: Well, there - there is a procurement\nclaim pending, Your Honor, but the Postal Rate Commission\nwould not have jurisdiction over the - the mail sack\npurchase at all, Your Honor. And so the - the fear is\nthat these kind of - of trade practices that are anti-\ncompetitive can go on without any kind of direct\nrestraint. Certainly there is an overlap between\nprocurement and antitrust, but it's not congruent in that\nsense.\nI think it's helpful to think about what\nCongress intended by waiving the Postal Service's immunity\nin the sue-and-be-sued clause. Clearly it has to apply to\nsomething. There was some point in waiving the immunity\nof the Postal Service. We know, for instance, at least I\nthink that the Government has conceded, that the Postal\nService is now subject to torts at state law torts. The -\nFranchise Tax suggested that the Government -\nQUESTION: Well, I - I thought conceded they were\nsubject to Federal Tort Claims Act?\nMR. KRENT: But the waiver was for torts and then\nthe limitation in the waiver said that the procedures of\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act must be applied, but clearly\nthere's a waiver -\nQUESTION: Even though it's a state court action\nagainst the Post Office?\nMR. KRENT: That's correct, just as it would be\nin any - for other Federal entity, but, for instance, the\n-\nQUESTION: So the - the Post Office can be sued\nin state court then for a - for a state tort?\nMR. KRENT: Well, it could be, except for the\nfact that the - the limitations of the Federal Tort Claims\nAct apply by virtue of 409.\nQUESTION: Well, that's - that what I thought I\nasked you a minute ago -\nMR. KRENT: Well then -\nQUESTION: - and you said something different.\nMR. KRENT: Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood\nyour question, Your Honor, but the - the argument then is\nthat - that in other kinds of cases, such as the state law\nthat said person in the Franchise Task - Tax - whether\nthat - the question is whether that applies to the Postal\nService as well, and of course in this Court, upheld the\ndetermination that the Postal Service would comply under\nthe term person under the state law as well.\nSo how far does person apply? Contract law,\ntort law, what about the Lanham Act, the trademark case?\nBefore the recent amendments to the Lanham Act that were\nmentioned recently, the - all the statute said was that it\nwas applied to persons, and three courts of appeals\nsuggested that even though person could not apply to the\nUnited States, person could apply to the Postal Service,\nby virtue of its distinct status.\nQUESTION: But I thought the Lanham Act,\ndefinition written right into the Lanham Act was that a\nperson within the meaning of that act is an organization\ncapable of suing and being sued.MR. KRENT: Yes, but courts\nhad said that the United States, previous to that, did not\nfall within the term person, because the person doesn't\nrefer to governmental entities at all. So there the courts\nhad distinguished -\nQUESTION: It said it with respect to the\nantitrust law in Cooper, but the Lanham Act defined person\ndifferently.\nMR. KRENT: But just slightly, Your Honor. The\nonly difference was the capable-of-being-sued part. The\nUnited States is also capable of being sued.\nQUESTION: But I - I thought that was what was\ncritical, that any organization capable of suing and being\nsued was within the Lanham Act.\nMR. KRENT: But the United States, Your Honor,\ncan also be sued and is capable of suing itself, so I'm\nnot sure that that distinguishes it, and indeed, under\nthat language, courts had held the United States was not\nliable, and yet the Postal Service had registered\ntrademarks in its own name, the Postal Service had\nregistered copyrights in its own name, even though the\nUnited States cannot hold copyrights, and there is an\nexception -\nQUESTION: But isn't there a good reason for\nthat?\nMR. KRENT: Well, I think there is a good reason.\nQUESTION: To stop people from engaging in\ndesigned piracy in stamps?\nMR. KRENT: And indeed, if that were all that the\nPostal Service had filed for, I would be - I would be in\ntotal agreement with Your Honor. But the Postal Service\nhad filed for 300, at least 350, I believe, copyrights,\nbooks, training manuals, things that have nothing to do\nwith the protection for the legitimacy of - of stamps.\nSo again, the Postal Office has defined itself\nthrough its actions as a person in comparable commercial\ntort situations. It's only logical that if a Postal\nService in the commercial world, saying that it's not like\nthe United States for copyrights, for trademarks, then\nit's not like United States with respect to antitrust.\nWhen Congress formed the Postal Service, Your\nHonors, and it took away the APA, the Postal Rate\nCommission for these non-monopoly actions, as well as the\nFederal acquisition regulations, certainly there was a\nquid pro quo.\nIf you streamline the operations of the Postal\nService, launch it into business, you would expect the\nprivate commercial torts in antitrust laws to be the\nrestraint to make sure that the monopoly is not extended\nto the other kind of operations. And so I think that\nCongress' intent is quite clear that the Postal Service is\nunique, does not partake of the United States, and\ntherefore, just as the Postal Service can be sued in tort\nlaw and under the Lanham Act, be it the old Lanham Act,\nthe new Lanham Act, it can be sued under the antitrust\nlaws as well.\nThe burden, therefore, on the Solicitor General\nto explain why Congress would have wanted the Postal\nService's monopoly to be extended, and why Congress would\nhave wanted the Postal Service to be sue - to be able to\nbe sued and to sue themselves without really being able to\ntake advantage of the opportunity to sue in their own name\nunder the antitrust laws or under trademark and copyright\nlaw, et cetera, and why they shouldn't be sued as well.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Krent.\nMr. Kneedler, you have six minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn addition to the other statutes that I've mentioned with\nrespect to the right to sue, there are a number of other\nrespects in which Congress has treated the Postal Service\nas a Federal entity. It's subject to their Freedom of\nInformation Act, the Privacy Act, the Inspector General\nAct, it's subject to the Federal sector OSHA regulations,\nand as this Court pointed out in the Loeffler decision,\nit's subject to the Federal sector Title VII prohibitions,\nnot - it's not treated as a private corporation for\npurposes of Title VII.\nIt is subject to the National Labor Relations\nAct, but this act was passed in 1970 before the Federal\nsector labor - labor management provisions came in in the\nCivil Service Reform Act, and as you pointed out, Justice\nScalia, that's an express provision subjecting the Postal\nService to something that otherwise applies to private\nentities, but in - but in virtually every other respect,\nCongress has specified that it would be subject to Federal\nlaw.\nAnd in section 409 of the act, with respect to\njudicial proceedings, Congress specified that the Postal\nService would be - would be treated just like the United\nStates, not just with respect to Tort Claims Act, but\nvenue, removal jurisdiction, and representation by the\nAttorney General.\nBut the - the most fundamental point, however,\nto be made is that this is not a situation in which\nCongress has created a new entity and launched, in that\nsense, that entity into a private commercial world. Here,\nCongress has carried forward the nation's tradition of\ntreating postal services as sovereign functions performed\nby the Government of the United States. These are - these\nare - to the extent they're commercial functions and - and\nthey are unusual commercial functions, the Constitution\ntreats them as - as something of particular interest to\nthe United States Government.\nI should point out that with respect to the\npostal services, all postal services are subject to the\njurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, not just those\nthat are subject to monopoly, that - that the Postal\nService has monopoly control over, Justice Breyer. So\neven in those areas in which the Postal Service is subject\nto competition in - in parcel and express mail, for\nexample, the Postal Service - the Postal Rate Commission -\ndoes have regulatory jurisdiction over those -\nQUESTION: So greeting cards?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It does not over greeting cards,\nbut the non-postal functions of the Postal Service\nconstitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the - of\nthe Postal Service. We're talking about a very minor\naspect of the Postal Service's operations, and the\naffirmative authorization for the Postal Service to engage\nin that in section 404(7) of the act is cast in the same\nterms as the Postal Service's authorization to engage in\nall the other functions and they're really incidental.\nQUESTION: But the fact that it's only - the fact\nthat it's only 1 percent means they're only liable under\nthe antitrust laws for 1 percent of their business.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I think - I think it shows\nthat - that - that the predominant character of the Postal\nService is as it always has been, and these - these other\nservices are really in most ways incidental to - to postal\nservices like greeting cards and - and that sort of thing.\nQUESTION: But they're the services that they\nwant to bring suits under. That's -\nMR. KNEEDLER: This - this is - this is not -\nthis is not that. This case is a - is an ordinary\nprocurement dispute that - all Federal agencies engage in\nprocurement and - and -\nQUESTION: That's the curious thing about this\nsuit. It actually represents a portion of the monopoly\nbusiness, of using the monopoly to - to monopolize\nprocurement.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And in procurement, and in\nprocurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal\nService like all other - all other Federal agencies under\nthe Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to\nthe disputes at issue here. So in the end we believe\nthat, as Justice O'Connor said, this is essentially a\npolicy choice for Congress. If - if in the current\nclimate the Postal Service is to be subject to the\nantitrust laws, notwithstanding the fact that it remains a\ngovernmental entity, that is a - that is a choice that\nCongress should make, whether these governmental\nactivities should be regulated by treble damage actions,\nwhich was extremely unusual under - under Federal\nstatutes.\nAnd where Congress has chosen to subject the\nUnited States to liability under statutes such as this,\nbut not nearly as free-ranging in the patent laws, et\ncetera, it has done so expressly, and we think 30 years\nafter the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act, that\nif the - if the Postal Service is now to be subject to the\nantitrust laws, that is something for Congress to do and\nnot for the courts to try to divine from complete silence\nin the Postal Reorganization Act or its legislative\nhistory on that point.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Do they really sell biking gear? They\ndon't sell biking gear. Do they sell biking gear?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure whether they - I\n- I don't know whether they sell biking gear. The fact\nthat they - the fact that they use the Postal Service team\nin - in - in promoting Postal Service products, I think,\ndoesn't say anything about whether they're subject -\nQUESTION: They might deliver some mail on\nbicycles, I mean -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's entirely possible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
