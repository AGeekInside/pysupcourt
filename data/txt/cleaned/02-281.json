KIRBY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KIRBY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn this case the Paiute propose and are seeking\na categorical rule that makes Indian tribes, their\ncasinos, their commercial businesses, and their personal\nproperty immune from search warrants and subpoenas issued\nin connection with the investigation of crime and the\nprosecution of crime.\nThey seek this rule under Federal statutory law,\nunder Federal common law, and under the Constitution.\nHowever, such a categorical rule is not supported by the\ntext, structure, or history of the Constitution, by any\nFederal statute, or by any sufficient or rational public\npolicy.\nFurther, there is not now, nor should this Court\nextend or create a common law right to be immune from\nsearch warrants and subpoenas that are issued in\nconnection with the investigation of crime and the\nprosecution of crime.\nIt is a --\nQUESTION: Counsel, did the tribe offer to\naccept as consent by the employees their employment forms?\nMR. KIRBY: Your Honor, I am prepared to answer\nthat question. It does involve matters outside the\nrecord, and I will proceed to answer.\nQUESTION: I see. I just thought it was a\nlittle curious that if some means of solving this had been\noffered, why we're here.\nMR. KIRBY: There was not any means of solving\nit at the time, Your Honor, because the Federal\nregulations that govern the public welfare act at\nquestion, title 45, part 205, prohibits the information\nfrom being disclosed.\nQUESTION: Okay, thank you.\nMR. KIRBY: It is --\nQUESTION: That goes for -- they had asked for\nedited copies. They just wanted the last page, and they\nsaid that they could be edited. Does the -- in your view\ndidn't Federal regulations preclude even those edited\ncopies of just the last page from being turned over?\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the\ninformation that's precluded from being distributed is the\nnames of the individuals who are being investigated.\nNow, I know that the allegation is made that in\nthe letter that was sent by the district attorney and by\nthe Department of Health and Human Services stated that\nthis was a welfare fraud investigation. However, that\nletter actually did not so state. It stated that the\ninvestigation was a confidential investigation that\nrequired the payroll information being sought.\nThe fundamental right and responsibility of\ngovernment is to protect its citizens, and one of the main\nways it does that, of course, is through the investigation\nand prosecution of crime. The Federal Government and the\nState government have together an integrated law\nenforcement regime that allows for search warrants and\nsubpoenas to be executed and issued in connection with the\ninvestigation of these crimes or alleged crimes whether\nthe criminal conduct occurs on the reservation or off the\nreservation and regardless of whether the evidence or\nproceeds of crime is thought to be on the reservation or\noff the reservation.\nFor instance, in a Public Law 280 State, such as\nCalifornia, if there is a crime committed off the\nreservation, frankly as well as on the reservation, the\nFederal Government does not have jurisdiction over that\ncrime. Thus, the Federal Government does not have the\nability to issue a search warrant. If the States do not\nhave the ability to issue a search warrant under those\ncircumstances and there is evidence of crime or proceeds\nof crime on the reservation, then that property or\nevidence remains immune from law enforcement.\nQUESTION: Is California one of the 280 States\nthat has jurisdiction?\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is\na Public Law 280 State.\nNow, in a non-Public Law 280 State, the same\nsituation presents itself because in that situation, the\nFederal Government has the right to -- and the -- the\nduty, if you will -- as a responsibility to its citizens\nto enforce the criminal law with regard to crimes that\noccur on the reservation that would be State crimes if\nthey occurred off the reservation. And under the Major\nCrimes Act, as well as the General Crimes Act, the Federal\nGovernment prosecutes that crime and, of course, does the\ninvestigation prior to prosecution. In order to conduct\nthose activities and to fulfill that mission, if you will,\nthe Federal Government needs to have the right and does\nhave the right to execute search warrants and to issue\nsubpoenas.\nNow, as we have seen, there may be a situation\nwhere a crime is committed on the reservation in a Public\nLaw 280 State and a crime committed in a -- the same crime\nin a non-Public Law 280 State, and in those situations,\nthere must be parity with regard to the law enforcement\nregime. If not, what we end up with is gaps in the\ncriminal justice system, and that wasn't the intent of the\nlegislature in enacting Public Law 280.\nAs the Court will recall, Public Law 280 was\npassed by Congress because of a perceived lawlessness on\ncertain reservations. That lawlessness arose because\nCongress felt that the Federal Government -- due to the\nvast distances, if you will, of Federal Government law\nenforcement agencies, and the lack of density of those\nagencies -- simply wasn't able to enforce criminal laws\nthroughout the vast acreage of reservations. And so --\nQUESTION:\nI understand it, was that a search warrant was served on\nthe tribe itself, and so I think that's what your argument\nshould probably be addressed to. I think in Hicks we held\nthat there could be process served against individual\ntribal members.\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Your Honor. The search warrant\nwas issued as to tribal property. I -- I would point out\nthat the search warrant itself didn't actually require the\ntribe to do anything other than stand by and allow the\nofficers to go forth and search. And in this --\nQUESTION: Well, that's true of most search\nwarrants.\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, the person served doesn't\nhave to do anything except let them search.\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Your Honor, the point being --\nthe point being that the search warrant did not hail the\nreservation or the tribe into court for the purpose of\nresponding to a civil judgment for the purpose of --\nQUESTION: What -- what was the tribal property\nat issue?\nMR. KIRBY: It was common payroll records,\nJustice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Were they records of the casino?\nMR. KIRBY:\nbusiness operated there, yes, the casino.\nQUESTION: Where were they kept? Were they kept\nat the casino?\nMR. KIRBY: Your Honor, they were kept in back\nof the casino, as I understand it, in an outbuilding that\nwas secured by a padlock.\nQUESTION: Would you -- would you draw a\ndistinction between the subpoena of the records of the\ncommercial operation and a subpoena of the records of the\n-- of the government records of the tribe itself?\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Scalia, there could\nvery well be a distinction there. And the solution that\nwe believe would address that distinction would be a\nsolution that Justice White presented in the Brendale\ndecision when he talked about a tribe having a unique\nprotectable interest in certain situations. And the tribe\nought to have a right to go to court -- in this case, it\nwould be a State court -- to present that protectable\ninterest so that a -- an interest-balancing assessment can\nbe accomplished.\nIn this case the interest of the tribal record\nmay very well outweigh a minimal interest of the State if\nit was a simple minor misdemeanor. On the other hand, it\nmay be that if it's a large serious felony of multiple\nmurder and there is very direct evidence in the records of\nthe tribal government, perhaps under those facts the court\nmay find that the interest weighed in favor of the State's\npolice power.\nQUESTION: But that --\nQUESTION: Isn't there the obvious --\nQUESTION: Is it that the local magistrate in\neach case has to -- and then the law enforcement officer\nweigh these interests? Well, this is a misdemeanor.\nWell, this is a felony. I -- I don't -- I think that\nwould be a very difficult rule to implement in practice.\nQUESTION: What does everybody do? Sort of\nstand around until the appeal is finally exhausted --\nMR. KIRBY: No.\nQUESTION: -- for a couple of years to see\nwhether they can do the search or not?\nMR. KIRBY: No, Justice Scalia, and no, Justice\nKennedy.\nWhat would happen would be once the probable\ncause determination is made that there is evidence of a\ncrime within the records of the casino in our\nhypothetical, the search warrant would be executed and the\nproperty would be seized and brought before the court. At\nthat time the tribe, if it thought it had a protectable\ninterest under State statute, perhaps because of certain\nstatutory privileges, or under some special protectable\ninterest that the tribe may feel that it has because of\nits unique domestic dependent sovereign status, could\npresent that interest balance analysis to the magistrate\nimmediately.\nQUESTION: But what good did it do to the State\n-- to the tribe after the horse is out of the barn? In\nother words, the State -- the tribe is not being\nprosecuted for anything in these cases. It's a tribal\nmember who's being prosecuted. And if you're saying,\nwell, the -- the warrant has to be executed but after the\nfact the State -- the tribe, to -- to ease its wounded\nfeelings, can have this declaration? I don't follow it.\nI mean, the tribe's idea is there is no right to\ncome on our property and seize our records. If you're\nsaying every time the county can do that and that all the\ntribe has is an after-the-fact determination by some\nmagistrate that the county was wrong, it's not much of a\nremedy, is it?\nMR. KIRBY: With all respect, Justice Ginsburg,\nI believe it's the best remedy available. The tribe's\ndesire to have a categorical rule that no search warrants\nmay be issued with regard to its property has disastrous\nconsequences when evidence or proceeds of a crime is\nlocated upon the reservation.\nQUESTION: Why? Why is that?\nyou've said so far, it sounds to me as if the State or the\ncounty went to the tribe and said, we want your records,\nand the tribe said, why? And the county said, we can't\ntell you. Well, obviously that would be a situation where\nthey might get their backs up.\nBut suppose you just said, look, the reason is\nthat we think there are a couple of people here who are\ncheating us. We think they get welfare from us and you're\npaying them too much. That's why we want to look at it.\nMaybe they would have said, sure, go look at it. But I\ntake it you couldn't do that simple thing?\nMR. KIRBY: Your Honor, the Federal regulation\nprohibits the --\nQUESTION: All right. So then isn't the\nsolution that maybe you need a law to overcome the Federal\nregulation or maybe you just go to a Federal official and\nsay, will you please ask them?\nMR. KIRBY: No, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: There's no way to do it. In other\nwords, under the law the only choice -- your major\nconstitutional thing is you have to say the only\npossibility is the county that wants to prosecute somebody\nhas to -- goes to the tribe and says, we want to prosecute\nsomebody. We won't tell you who. We can't tell you why.\nGive us all your records.\nI'd think the tribe would certainly have a point. And yet\n-- yet if -- if you were behaving reasonably and maybe --\nmaybe if Federal law prevents you from behaving\nreasonably, maybe they should change it.\nHow is this supposed to work out?\nMR. KIRBY: Well, Justice Breyer, looking at the\nsituation that you've presented, which is our situation,\none must remember that letters were sent by the Department\nof Health and Human Services to the three individuals\nasking for a reconciliation. Letters were sent by the\ndistrict attorney to these same three individuals. Two\nletters were sent to the tribe asking for the information,\nwhich the tribe had honored five times in the last\napproximately two years, and the tribe had actually in one\nof those occasions asked for a search warrant, which it\nthen honored. There was a history of working with the\ntribe to obtain this information.\nDuring this circumstance, the tribe took the\nposition it was no longer going to do that. It wanted to\nhave something more, and in fact the tribal attorney\nsuggested that a search warrant be obtained. And as it\nhad been in another circumstance within the preceding 12\nmonths. So there is a clear history of trying to work\nwith the tribe.\nWhat ended up happening in this case is what\ncould happen in any case. The tribe, for whatever reason,\ndepending upon whatever tribal government might have been\nelected at the time -- and it -- they may have been\ndifferent on that day than they were during the preceding\n2 years -- decided, no, we're not going to do that any\nlonger. And that's how this situation came to fruition.\nAnd what we're looking at --\nQUESTION: Well, do you have other means to get\nthe information? Can you question the people you suspect\nof welfare fraud and ask them how much they earned, if\nanything?\nMR. KIRBY: Justice O'Connor, that was done on\nat least two separate occasions. Letters were sent to\neach of the three casino employees advising them of the\ndiscrepancy and asking that the employees come in and\nreconcile the discrepancy. Those letters, unfortunately,\nwere ignored. And so the county was faced with the\nsituation where it is mandated to have such an\ninvestigation process into potential fraud by the --\nQUESTION: Well, presumably you could question\nsupervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask\nthem how much have you paid these people, if anything.\nCould you do that?\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice O'Connor, that could be\ndone.\nwould subject themselves and submit to questioning and\nproviding the information verbally that they have refused\nto provide in writing simply by filling out a form\nrequesting the information.\nQUESTION: Well, we have said that the -- in\nMinnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a\nproceeding against property in which the United States has\nan interest is a suit against the United States. Do you\ntake the position that you can file a suit against the\nIndian tribe without its consent?\nMR. KIRBY: Justice O'Connor, when property is\nat issue, we have an in rem situation that doesn't require\na lawsuit. We have the -- I believe it's Minnesota and\nthe Cass County case which --\nQUESTION: Well, you didn't answer my question.\nMR. KIRBY: I apologize.\nQUESTION: Do you take the position that you can\nfile a suit against the tribe?\nMR. KIRBY: Not to differ or to draw hairs, yes,\nthe suit could be filed and if the tribe consented to\njurisdiction, then we could resolve it in court.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- against its consent.\nMR. KIRBY: Not against its consent. That's\nright.\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kirby, isn't it the case that --\nthat you can sue -- the United States can be sued against\nits -- against its consent if it's operating a commercial\nenterprise. Isn't that the international law of sovereign\nimmunity, just as under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct a foreign sovereign can be sued in this country\nagainst its will if it is operating a commercial\nenterprise?\nMR. KIRBY: That is my understanding, Justice\nScalia, and that is the case we have here.\nQUESTION: No, but isn't there one difference?\nAnd that is, take the foreign sovereign situation.\nThere's a statute of the United States. And -- and if we\nstart with the assumption, as I do, that we are in a\ndifferent situation from -- from what we faced in Hicks so\nthat we're talking about, in effect, a claim directly\nagainst the -- the sovereign itself, and if we also\nassume, which I think is correct, that the ultimate party\nin interest in this kind of a welfare fraud situation is\nthe United States, why isn't the sensible answer to say,\nall right, if the United States wants the tribes to be\ntreated like foreign sovereigns in a commercial\nenterprise, and if the United States wants to regard the\ncasinos as a commercial enterprise for that purpose, let\nit pass a statute comparable to the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act?\nMR. KIRBY: That would certainly be a resolution\nof this case, Justice Souter. However, what we're left\nwith dealing today without congressional action is the\ncommon law tribal immunity doctrine as set forth by this\nCourt and the Montana analysis that this Court has set\nforth with regard to --\nQUESTION: Has Congress ever adopted a statute\nspeaking to tribal sovereign immunity?\nMR. KIRBY: No, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Isn't it entirely a creation of this\nCourt?\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Scalia, it is.\nQUESTION: And if in fact --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't it also a -- a\ncreation which basically was an adoption of an\ninternational law norm?\nMR. KIRBY: Initially --\nQUESTION: Isn't that what John Marshall thought\nhe was doing?\nMR. KIRBY: I believe that the tribal sovereign\nimmunity doctrine commenced with the Turner decision which\nwas approximately 1919. And as this Court indicated in\nthe Kiowa decision, that sovereign immunity doctrine was\ncreated almost by accident. It was --\nQUESTION: What about Worcester v. Georgia? I\nthought that the -- the tribal sovereign immunity began\nlong before 19-something.\nQUESTION: So did I.\nMR. KIRBY: Worcester v. Georgia, Justice\nGinsburg and Justice Souter, dealt with primarily treaty\nrights and the -- the need for Justice Marshall to try to\n-- to put, if you will, or place the tribes who were\nnation -- independent nations, sovereigns of this country,\ninto some category that was different from nation states.\nOur Constitution recognizes that Indian tribes are not\nnation -- foreign nation states. In the Commerce Clause,\nwe speak to the Interstate Commerce Clause as States being\none type of entity, Indian tribes being another, and\nforeign nations being another. So tribes have always been\nconsidered differently. And here they are domestic\ndependent sovereigns which has characteristics totally\ndifferent from foreign nation states.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kirby --\nQUESTION: I think we will hear in about a\nminute, if we get to the main issue of this, I suspect --\nyou see, on the one hand if we decide in your favor, that\nmeans that any magistrate in the State, of which there may\nbe many, in any criminal case whatsoever for probable\ncause can allow State officials to go into all the tribal\ndocuments no matter how many there are, no matter how\nrelated to government of the tribe, whatever they are.\nThey're most -- they're most key matters for the tribe's\ngovernance. But if we decide against you, all it means is\nthat you have to go to the Federal Government and convince\nthem that this is really important and then they'll deal\nwith it.\nMR. KIRBY: Well, Justice Breyer, Congress\ncertainly has plenary power over Indian tribes.\nQUESTION: I'm not thinking of Congress. I'm\nsaying right now -- you go to the Interior Department.\nThey have people there. You go tell them what the problem\nis, and they say -- you say, this tribe is being totally\nunreasonable here, completely. I don't know why but they\nare. And -- and if they feel it's important that the\nFederal Government now has adequate ways of getting you\nthe information you need. Now -- now am I wrong?\nMR. KIRBY: Justice Breyer, with all respect,\nyes, you are wrong.\nQUESTION: There's no way. In other words, it's\njust we're at a -- at a loss. Either -- either -- we'd\nhave to get legislation, in your opinion.\nMR. KIRBY: In my opinion we have to adopt a --\nfirst of all, we cannot adopt a categorical rule that the\ntribes propose.\nthat is acceptable to certainly the majority of the\nCourt --\nQUESTION: All right. You -- it's acceptable to\nyou. You say commercial -- if it's a commercial body like\na casino, that's -- they don't have the immunity, but if\nit's noncommercial, it's okay. But has this been argued\nbelow whether they're commercial or noncommercial?\nMR. KIRBY: It has not been argued below,\nJustice Breyer. However, that's not the distinction that\nwe're making between commercial and governmental activity\nbecause, as I indicated earlier, if the government\nminutes, if you will, the tribal minutes, have direct\nevidence of a very serious felony for whatever reason --\nQUESTION: Okay. The distinction you would be\nmaking is?\nMR. KIRBY: A balancing interest, Your --\nJustice Breyer. And I believe that --\nQUESTION: Why do you want to --\nMR. KIRBY: -- under the Younger abstention\ndoctrine -- yes, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: You want to do it the hard way. I\nmean, the -- you win this case if we say you can subpoena\nthe commercial -- the records of a commercial enterprise\nbeing run by the tribe, but you don't want to do that.\nMR. KIRBY:\nthat ground, Justice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: May I ask, speaking of that -- that\nquestion, does the tribe itself operate the casino or does\nit operate it through a corporation of some kind?\nMR. KIRBY: The casino is operated through a\ncorporation that is chartered by the tribe, not by the\nState. So the tribe has certain policies wherein it\nblesses an organization as a -- as a tribal corporation.\nQUESTION: Your -- your petition raises three\nquestions, and so far, due to no fault of your own, you've\nonly covered one of them. Do you want to try to get to\nthe other two or three?\nMR. KIRBY: Justice Rehnquist, I see that my\ntime is drawing to a close. If I may, I would like to\nreserve my time and perhaps address that in reply.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMs. McDowell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS IN PART\nAND THE RESPONDENTS IN PART\nMS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would first like to correct one\nmisunderstanding that the Court may have been left with as\na result of Mr. Kirby's comments. There is no Federal\nregulation or other Federal requirement that would have\nprevented the county or the State from sharing with the\ntribe the information, the welfare applications, and so\non. Federal --\nQUESTION: Well, but even so, let's assume\nthere's a serious felony having been committed involving a\ncrime of violence where employees of the casino are\nimplicated. Surely, the district attorney's office or the\ncounty is not going to share that information with --\nnecessarily with -- with the whole tribal council.\nMS. McDOWELL: In the first place --\nQUESTION: That seems -- that seems to me a very\ndisruptive proposal for -- for orderly law enforcement.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, Your Honor, nothing in the\nposition that's being urged here would preclude a State\nfrom proceeding against individual tribal members and\nsearching their own --\nQUESTION: No, but the suggestion was that\nthere'd be a lot of cooperation between the tribes. But\nit seems to me that that may compromise a very serious\ncriminal investigation.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, and -- and if that's the\ncase, they would not need to share the information with\nthe tribe, but they could proceed against the individual\ntribal member.\nQUESTION: No, no. But -- no, the problem that\nhe's trying to put -- imagine the most serious crime you\ncan think of committed off the reservation by people who\nhave nothing to do with the Indian tribe, for example, but\nthere is a key piece of evidence that is there in the\ntribal document and they want to get it.\nNow, what we've just been told is there -- they\ncan't -- if -- if we decide for the tribe, there's no way\nwhatsoever they can get it. It's impossible. If the\ntribe refuses to cooperate, the Federal Government can do\nnothing without new laws being passed. Now, is all that\nthe case?\nMS. McDOWELL: No, that's not the case, Justice\nBreyer. In many instances, of course, if there was a\nserious crime, it's a crime that the Federal Government,\nas well as the State, could prosecute, and there's no\nimmunity bar to --\nQUESTION: But if there -- it's not --\nQUESTION: In the 280 jurisdiction?\nMS. McDOWELL: Even in the Public Law 280\njurisdiction, Justice O'Connor, because there are Federal\nstatutes, as you're well aware, dealing with firearms,\nnarcotics, racketeering and so on that could often be used\nin this sort of situation.\nIn addition, the Federal Government could often\nbring the parties together and try to reconcile these\nsorts of disagreements. Tribes, after all, are sovereign\ngovernments. They have a significant interest in law\nenforcement.\nQUESTION: Well, Ms. McDowell, let's talk about\ntheir being sovereign. I had thought that we -- that our\ncases make very clear that their sovereignty is a peculiar\nand lesser kind of sovereignty. It is certainly -- does\nnot exceed the sovereignty of the States or of foreign\ncountries. And I -- I am perplexed at why -- why the\nUnited States wants to accord the -- the tribe's\ncommercial enterprises greater protection than is accorded\nto England or -- or Germany or any -- any foreign\nsovereign --\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, of course --\nQUESTION: -- where suit is allowed. And I'm\nsure in the course of suit, you can subpoena documents\nrelating to that -- to that commercial enterprise. Why\nshould we -- and that provision in the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act was simply a reflection of what the\ninternational norm had become. Now, why in the world\nshould we accord greater protection to this lesser\nsovereignty that -- that consists of the Indian tribe?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, in the Kiowa case, Your\nHonor, the Court extended tribal sovereign immunity to\ncommercial off-reservation activities of a tribe. The\nCourt recognized that any limitation on tribal sovereign\nimmunity that would exclude a tribe's commercial\nactivities from the protections of sovereign immunity was\na task for Congress rather than for the judiciary.\nAnd it is significant that when commercial\nactivities of the United States Government, for example,\nhave been -- when suit has been allowed against such\nentities, it's been a matter of -- of statute, not a\nmatter of judicial decision. Indeed, the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act is, after all, a statutory\nprotection.\nQUESTION: I think there was a dissent in that\ncase that made the point that Justice Scalia has been\npursuing.\nI'd like to back up and find out how we got\nhere. This is a suit brought by the tribe, not by the\ncounty, right?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I think you are urging that 1983\nis not available --\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct.\nQUESTION:\nor defendant.\nIf 1983 is not available, then what is the\nbasis? What statute does the tribe's case arise under for\nthe substantive determination that you would like to have\nthe Court adjudicate? If we don't have 1983, what Federal\nlaw does the case arise under?\nMS. McDOWELL: It's generally been understood,\nYour Honor, although not specifically addressed in a\ndecision of this Court, that the Supremacy Clause and the\nFederal jurisdictional statutes provide a right of action\nfor injunctive and declaratory relief when a party is\nclaiming that State action is precluded by superseding --\nQUESTION: Are you saying it's a kind of Bivens\naction?\nMS. McDOWELL: It may be that. It's -- it's\nsimilar to Ex parte Young. Justice Kennedy's dissenting\nopinion in the second Golden State Transit case discusses\nthis at -- at some length. Also the Court's decision in\nShaw v. Delta Air Lines provides a number of -- of\ncitations to cases that arose in this particular context.\nSo it is a settled, although not frequently discussed\nbasis, of coming into Federal court to challenge State\naction.\nQUESTION: Is -- is there a problem on an Ex\nparte Young theory here?\nthey're not simply asking the tribe to stop doing\nsomething that's unlawful by going against the officer who\ndoes it. They are asking for tribal property.\nMS. McDOWELL: I think you're referring to a\nsituation where a State would sue the tribe.\nQUESTION: Well, they -- that's what's going on.\nThe -- the county here wants tribal property, right?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct. It has obtained\na search warrant against tribal property. Interestingly\nenough, the return of the search warrant directs the tribe\nthat if they want the property back, they will have to\ncome into State court and proceed under the California\nCriminal Code.\nQUESTION: Well, is that Ex parte Young?\nMS. McDOWELL: No. That's not Ex parte Young.\nEx parte Young is -- is based essentially on what the\nCourt has called the legal fiction that when a State\nofficer is violating superior Federal law --\nQUESTION: Right. So -- so Ex parte Young isn't\ngoing to cover a situation like that. I mean, an Ex parte\nYoung analog in this situation isn't going to cover the --\nthe request here.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, it is when one is\nconsidering the tribe's suit against the petitioners.\nQUESTION:\nFederal -- basis for Federal jurisdiction of the tribe's\nsuit against the petitioners if 1983 is not available?\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, the jurisdictional basis is\nsection 1331, Federal question jurisdiction, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But surely the Federal law that the\ncase arises under is not 1331 itself. You have to have\nanother law, and the one exception to that is on the\nFederal side when the Court created the Bivens action\nbecause Congress had not enacted a statute like 1983 to\ncover Federal offices.\nBut you seem to be asking us to create another\nsuch category where there's some right of action implied\nfrom what?\nMS. McDOWELL: From the Supremacy Clause, Your\nHonor, because the tribe's Federal common law immunity\nsupersedes the State enforcement of a State search warrant\nagainst it.\nQUESTION: This is such an obvious way to raise\nthis kind of issue without that. The next time somebody\nwants something from the tribe, they say no, make them go\nto court and appeal it.\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, but a search warrant is\nobtained in an ex parte proceeding, Your Honor. There's\nno opportunity for --\nQUESTION:\nsearch warrant and say, no, I think it's an unlawful\nwarrant and go right to the State court and appeal it?\nMS. McDOWELL: No, you can't, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Everybody just has to follow this.\nThere's no procedure to resist --\nMS. McDOWELL: No, there's no procedure for\nthat. And indeed, a -- a party that resists the search\nwarrant may subject itself to criminal penalties for doing\nso.\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nMS. McDOWELL: So that's not an optimal\nprocedure.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about your\ntheory that the tribe is not a person within the meaning\nof 1983? You seem to assume that if they could not be\nmade a defendant, they also could not be a plaintiff.\nDon't you make that assumption in your argument?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nthat's because the term person --\nQUESTION: And isn't that assumption plainly\nwrong? Because for -- to be a defendant, you have to act\nunder color of State law. So there are all sorts of\npersons who can be plaintiffs who could never be\ndefendants.\nMS. McDOWELL:\nthe case that a tribe could not act under State law, Your\nHonor, because, for example, with jointly administering --\nQUESTION: But in the normal course of events,\nit wouldn't be acting under State law. It's acting under\nits own law.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, or it may be\nacting under Federal law.\nQUESTION: So in the normal course of events,\nthe fact that it might not be a defendant wouldn't shed\nany light at all on the question of whether it could be a\nperson for plaintiff purposes.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, generally, Your Honor, the\nCourt has applied the interpretive presumption that the\nterm person doesn't include a sovereign. The term person\nappears twice in the same sentence in section 1983, so it\nwould be curious if it was construed differently.\nQUESTION: Well, but a citizen, an ordinary\ncitizen, could be a person for plaintiff's purposes but\nnot necessarily a defendant.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, that -- that may indeed be\nthe case, Your Honor.\nIn the South Carolina Ports decision recently,\nthe Court recognized that the preeminent purpose of\nsovereign immunity is to assure that sovereigns are\ntreated with the dignity that their sovereign status\nentitles them. The execution of a State warrant is a\nparticular threat to the dignity of a sovereign tribe,\neven more so perhaps than hauling it into court. It's\nobtained ex parte.\nQUESTION: You think that's so when -- when what\nyou're doing is getting the records of a casino? I\nmean --\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct. Now, we're not\nsaying that every tribal business necessarily is an arm of\nthe tribe for sovereign immunity purposes, but the\nparticular characteristics -- may I finish, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMr. Peyton -- Mr. Peyton Chambers.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF REID PEYTON CHAMBERS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CHAMBERS: Thank you, Mr. --\nQUESTION: Are you Mr. Peyton Chambers or Mr.\nChambers?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'm Mr. Chambers.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThere are three principles of Federal law that\nbar this search warrant.\nimmunity. The second is the longstanding principle that\nStates may not infringe the right of tribes to govern\nthemselves or internal affairs on their reservation. And\nthe third is that there's no act of Congress that\nauthorizes this search warrant, though two statutes,\nPublic Law 280 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, do\nprovide a framework for some assumption of State\njurisdiction over tribes and Indians on reservation -- the\n-- reservations. The county doesn't claim that either\napplies here to authorize this act, and they do not.\nI -- I want to address, if I may, Justice\nScalia's question about the commercial and governmental\ndistinction because basically the Indian Gaming Act by\nCongress sets up a framework for tribes to operate gaming.\nThis is a tribal enterprise. It has to be, under the\nGaming Act, owned and controlled by the tribe. It -- and\nthe proceeds of the gaming have to be used for tribal\npurposes, chiefly tribal governmental purposes. And they\nare by the Bishop Paiute Tribe.\nThe Bishop Paiute Tribe is a small tribe in a\nremote area of California. It uses all of its gaming\nrevenues to operate tribal programs on its reservation.\nLike most tribes, the Bishop -- the Bishop Tribe operates\na health clinic, for example, educational programs,\nwelfare programs --\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt --\nMR. CHAMBERS: Certainly, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: -- on the corporate point that was\nbrought up earlier? Who pays the income tax on the\nearnings of the casino? The corporation or the tribe?\nMR. CHAMBERS: The -- the tribe is not taxable\nunder the Federal income tax laws, Justice Stevens. And\n-- and the corporation, as an arm of the tribe, is not\ntaxable.\nQUESTION: So there are no taxes on the\nearnings.\nMR. CHAMBERS: There -- there are no taxes.\nThis is a relatively small casino. It's in a pretty\nremote part of California, sort of halfway between Los\nAngeles --\nQUESTION: But it is owned by a corporation\nrather than by the tribe itself?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, Justice Stevens, it's\noperated by a corporation that was chartered by the tribe.\nIt's wholly owned by the tribe. And it -- it -- the board\nof directors, for example, is removable --\nQUESTION: Well, who owns the real estate that\nthe casino is located on? The tribe or the corporation?\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, the tribe, Justice Stevens.\nThe tribe owns all the real estate on this small\nreservation in eastern California. It's an 800-acre real\nestate -- or trust land. It's owned by the United States\nin trust for the tribe.\nQUESTION: How about the slot --\nQUESTION: But this -- what you're saying is\ntrue of all --\nQUESTION: How about the slot machines? Who\nowns the slot machines? The tribe or the corporation?\nMR. CHAMBERS: They'd be tribal property,\nJustice Stevens, and operated --\nQUESTION: Well, what does the -- does the\ncorporation own anything?\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, I don't believe so, Justice\nStevens. It's a simply a tribal arm and -- and it's --\nit's -- it is the tribe. And it has to be the tribe under\nthe Indian Gaming Act. My point is that Congress --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're sure that it doesn't\nown -- what does it do? What -- you say it doesn't own\nthe land. It doesn't own the slot machines. What -- what\ndoes it do?\nMR. CHAMBERS: It -- it operates the gaming\nfacility rather than having the tribal political leaders,\nJustice Scalia, engaged in the day-to-day operation of the\n-- of the gaming activity. But it's --\nQUESTION:\ngovernment has now been so infused with a commercial\ncharacter, that it seems to me calls tribal immunity into\nquestion generally.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, let me try to persuade you\nit doesn't, Justice Kennedy. That the -- I mean here,\nfirst of all, the Indian Gaming Act was enacted for the\npurpose of strengthening tribal governments. That's what\nCongress was doing. Secondly, Congress required the tribe\nto own and control gaming operations. And third, Congress\nlimited the revenues that the tribe gets from the gaming\noperation to be used essentially for the welfare of the\nmembers of the --\nQUESTION: How is that different from any\nforeign country that wholly owns a corporation engaged in\n-- in business? For any foreign country, when it owns\nsuch a corporation, all the revenue, all the profits go to\nthe treasury of the foreign country to be used for the\npublic benefit. At least where that is the case, I think\nthat the sovereign immunity turns on the nature of the\noperation, not on whether the revenues go to the benefit\nof the people of the country.\nMR. CHAMBERS: But, Justice Breyer, there of\ncourse the country, the legislature, or the government of\nthat country could decide what to do with its revenues.\nQUESTION:\n-- so tell me precisely what is the difference between the\ncasino and, let's say, the state of -- the Government of\nFinland which happens to own a shipping business 100\npercent and the revenues and profits from that shipping\nbusiness go entirely to health care, parks, other things\nfor the people of Finland. Now, what's the difference\nbetween our Finnish shipping line and the casino here?\nMR. CHAMBERS: There are two differences,\nJustice Breyer.\nFirst, the Finnish government, if it wanted to\ncould decide to invest the proceeds of the shipping line\nin the U.S. stock market. The tribe cannot do that. The\ntribe is constrained by Congress to use the revenues\nessentially for governmental purposes or for charitable\ndonations or a couple of other purposes. But it's not --\nit's like a State lottery I suppose, although even there\nthe State legislature could decide to use the State\nlottery for some other purpose.\nThe second distinction really was I think\npointed out in -- in Justice Souter's question to -- I\nforget whether it was to Mr. Kirby or Ms. McDowell. But\n-- but Congress has enacted the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act which provides that a commercial enterprise\nof a foreign nation operating in the United States is\nstripped of its sovereign immunity.\nCongress has never done that for a tribe, and\nit's very important to note that while sovereign immunity\nin the tribal context is a common law doctrine developed\nby this Court, it has been adopted by Congress. Most\nimportantly, in the Indian Self-Determination Act of\n1975 --\nQUESTION: Why aren't you relying on Kiowa\nCounty? Because that was as commercial as a deal could be\nand the Court said no sovereign immunity.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed\nout, there was a dissent there, but a difference in Kiowa\nCounty is that you had a tribe engaged in the commercial\noperation outside the reservation. That's not so here.\nThis is entirely on the reservation. It's a tribe --\nQUESTION: That's a fortiori for you I would\nthink. I would think that the difference in Kiowa is --\nis -- it seems to me one -- one might say when the money\nis coming -- when money is sought that comes out of the\ntribal treasury, we're not -- we're not willing to take\ninto account the commercial nature of the enterprise.\nIt's still coming out of the tribal treasury.\nBut this is quite a different matter. Nothing\ncomes out of the tribal treasury. And you're -- you're\njust seeking documents that belong to the commercial\nenterprise essentially.\nnecessarily covers this case.\nMR. CHAMBERS: I hope I can persuade you that it\ndoes, Justice Scalia, that -- that -- the sovereign\nimmunity basically covers funds and property and the\noperation of a tribal or any government, whether it's the\nFederal Government, a State government, or a tribal\ngovernment. And it protects that categorically from\njudicial process of a non-superior sovereign.\nHere the tribe is not subordinate to the State\nof California. The tribe is subordinate to the United\nStates and the county is subordinate to the State of\nCalifornia. But the tribe is not subordinate to\nCalifornia. So the tribe's policy cannot be displaced by\nCalifornia when it's operating its own government.\nNow, this could apply to any record of the\ntribe, and -- and the tribe operates, as I said, health\ncare programs, educational programs. All -- virtually all\nIndian tribes do this today, and it's --\nQUESTION: The tribe is subordinate to this --\nto this extent, that the laws of the State of California\ncan be enforced under -- under section 280.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice --\nQUESTION: Under law 280.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Kennedy, Public Law 280\nconfers criminal jurisdiction on California on offenses by\nor against Indians. That's the language of Public Law\n280. It does not apply to tribes. The Court held in the\nBryan v. Itasca County case that Public Law 280 does not\napply to tribes, and in the second Three Affiliated Tribes\ndecision, the Court said that Public Law 280 does not\nwaive tribal immunity or interfere with tribal rights of\nself-governance. So -- so Public Law 280 -- and the State\ndoesn't claim -- I'm sorry -- the county doesn't claim\nthat the State has any jurisdiction over the tribe under\nPublic Law 280.\nThat proceeds really to another reason why the\n-- why the warrant is not good here under Federal law.\nQUESTION: Well, but it -- but it has\njurisdiction over individuals who by hypothesis either in\nthis case or some hypothetical case might be given --\nmight be being -- being sheltered by the tribe.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, Justice Kennedy, the tribe\nisn't sheltering anybody. This tribe wouldn't shelter\nanybody and -- and tribes don't do that.\nQUESTION: Well, why didn't the tribe --\nQUESTION: We're -- we're talking about\nhypothetical instances --\nMR. CHAMBERS: Okay.\nQUESTION: -- as to how this -- as to how this\nrule that you advocate would apply.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Kennedy, I think how it\nshould apply is that the rule should encourage cooperative\nintergovernmental agreements between tribes and counties,\nand that is in fact what happens all over Indian\nreservations today, that --\nQUESTION: Well, then why didn't it happen on\nyour side?\nI would like to ask a question of the same\nnature that Justice O'Connor asked the county. These were\nemployees of the casino. They had twice received notices\nfrom the county saying, here's the payroll thing, what it\nsays you've got, and here is the welfare payment you\nreceived. Would you please reconcile these? And the\nemployees didn't respond, didn't respond twice. And so\nthe county comes to the employer, the casino, and says,\nhelp us out. These people -- I guess we could lock them\nup, but we would prefer just to have you give us the\nrecords that will enable us to determine whether there was\nwelfare cheating.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Ginsburg, the tribe tried\nto avoid this confrontation. First, the tribe did get a\nletter asking for information about three employees\nwithout any specification of why. The tribe responded\nthat its policies do not allow a disclosure of employee\ninformation without the consent of the employees. Then,\nwithout any further notice, the county came to the tribe\nwith armed officers and insisted on seeing the records.\nNow, the reason that -- I mean, the tribe has\nsecurity officers in the casino. They came in a private\npart of the casino. But obviously the tribe doesn't want\nthat kind of confrontation. They told the officers where\nthe records were. The officers went with deadbolt cutters\ninto the tribe's building, cut the locks, and seized the\nrecords.\nQUESTION: Are you saying the tribe did not know\nthat this investigation pertained to welfare fraud?\nMR. CHAMBERS: I believe that is correct at the\ntime that the search warrant was executed, Justice\nGinsburg.\nNow, the tribe took that hit basically. I mean,\nthe tribe didn't do anything. They approached the\ndistrict attorney. They said we don't want to have this\nkind of thing happening again and offered to work it out\nby accepting simply a copy of the last page of the --\nCalifornia law requires a welfare applicant to sign an\nacknowledgement that employers can turn records over to\nthe county investigating welfare fraud.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kirby said there was some Federal\nregulation that blocked that and then Ms. McDowell told us\nthat there is no such regulation.\nMR. CHAMBERS: I think Ms. McDowell is right,\nJustice Ginsburg. But -- but I guess one would have to\nlook at the regulation, and I'm sure the Court will.\nQUESTION: All right. So what's your suggestion\non this point? That -- it seems to me that what we have\nis an instance where perhaps both sides feel the other was\nbeing very unreasonable, but something that should have\nbeen worked out. And -- and so because you couldn't work\nit out, one way to work it out would be get the Federal\nGovernment involved, but it couldn't be worked out.\nSo now we're in a position of either having to\nsay no matter how unreasonable the tribe is in stopping\nthe State from getting evidence of a serious crime, well,\nthat's -- the tribe wins, or saying no matter how\nunreasonable the State is in trying to interfere with the\nactivities of the tribe, they win.\nNow, to me quite honestly, neither of those\nsolutions is satisfactory. Do we have to choose the one\nor the other?\nMR. CHAMBERS: I think that you have to choose a\n-- a solution that respects the tribe's operation as a\ngovernment. The tribe --\nQUESTION: If I have to choose, why wouldn't I\njust say, if I'm trying to look for a compromise that\npreserves the essence of it, very well, if I have to\nchoose between two imaginary, unreasonable warring\nparties, I will say that where it's commercial, the tribe\nloses; where it's noncommercial, the tribe wins. What's\nwrong with that, which is where we started?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, what's wrong with that here\nis we don't have imaginary parties. We have real parties\nhere.\nQUESTION: No. I understand that.\nMR. CHAMBERS: I understand your hypothetical\nand I -- I don't want to say it's not this case. I know\nI'm not supposed to say that.\nBut I -- but I think that -- that the -- I mean,\nhere what you have is a tribe that tried to work it out.\nThe tribe was willing and is willing to sign an\nintergovernmental law enforcement agreement with the\ncounty.\nTribes and counties do this all over the\ncountry. You know this, for example, from the amicus\nbrief filed by four States on behalf of the tribe in this\ncase, four States that have two-thirds of the Indian\nreservation trust lands in the country in their borders\nand the majority of Indians who live on reservations\nwithin their borders. Those States say that they work it\nout between tribes and counties, tribes and States.\nTribes have agreements all over the country with counties\nabout domesticating search warrants, about extradition --\nQUESTION: Those -- those agreements may be\nprompted by at least the uncertainty of what would happen\nif they didn't make an agreement. I mean, we don't know\nthat those agreements aren't prompted in part by the\nuncertainty as to whether, if there were not an agreement,\nthe State couldn't come in anyway.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, Justice Scalia, I -- I\nthink that ascribes -- tribes do try to operate -- tribes\nhave a very strong interest in law enforcement too. And\n-- and there were plenty of alternatives here available to\nthe county. The county could have gone and gotten a\nsearch warrant against the individuals. That -- those are\nthe people they had to prove had the intent to defraud\nthem anyway.\nQUESTION: But the individuals don't have the\nrecords. The -- the tribe does have the payroll records.\nMR. CHAMBERS: They would presumably, Justice\nGinsburg, I think have their bank accounts or -- or\ncancelled checks or -- or other information.\nQUESTION: Suppose the question were the casino\ndidn't file whatever was required, the State -- whatever\npayroll reports it was required to report to the State.\nSo it's the tribe's default. And the State now wants to\nenforce the requirement that -- that all employers in the\nState file certain records about their employees. Could\nthe State, which could go after any other operation that\nfails to file required papers, go after the tribe?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Ginsburg, the tribe is\nrequired under its compact with the State of California to\nfile certain information because the tribe, for example,\nparticipates --\nQUESTION: Yes, and if it doesn't -- doesn't --\nMR. CHAMBERS: If it doesn't, there are dispute\nresolution mechanisms in the compact and there's a waiver\nof tribal sovereign immunity for the enforcement of those\ndispute resolution provisions. So the answer to the\nquestion in -- in that situation is that the State could\nget that information.\nBut here the tribe has filed all the things it's\nrequired under that compact to file with the State --\nQUESTION: May I ask kind of a background\nquestion? Because I'm really not sure of the answer.\nSupposing a tort was committed within the casino\nby one non-Indian against another non-Indian. Where would\nthe recovery be allowed for that tort? Could they sue in\nan Indian court or State court, and what law would apply?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Stevens, in that case\nthey would sue in State court because the State would have\njurisdiction over a civil action, even actually in a\nPublic Law 280 State between an Indian and an Indian.\nQUESTION: Suppose there was a tort committed by\na casino employee against a patron. Would the State have\njurisdiction over that suit?\nMR. CHAMBERS: The State would have jurisdiction\nover that suit, Justice Stevens, unless the nature of\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, could the -- could the litigant\nin that suit get discovery from the tribe in that suit --\nMR. CHAMBERS: I was going to say --\nQUESTION: -- in State court?\nMR. CHAMBERS: They could not get discovery to\nthe extent that it would intrude on essential governmental\nfunctions of the tribe because that would be --\nQUESTION: Well, the very records that were\ninvolved in this case -- some reason they had to identify\nthe particular person in the casino who was responsible\nfor the tort and you have to look at employment records to\nfind out. Could they get that in a civil suit in State\ncourt, do you think?\nMR. CHAMBERS: No -- no, they could not without\nthe tribe's consent, Justice Stevens. But in the ordinary\ncourse of business, if the tribe understood the nature and\nneed of the issue, why, almost surely it would comply with\na -- with a request like that. But --\nQUESTION: You -- you say essential government\nrecords, but these are basically commercial records, are\nthey not?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Mr. Chief Justice, I see I\nhaven't persuaded you. I -- I think they are given the\nnature of Congress' oversight and limitations Congress has\nput on the operation of this facility and -- and all\ntribal gaming facilities. So this isn't just any tribal\nbusiness. This is a business that's operated under pretty\nstrict guidelines by Congress for it to be owned and\noperated by the tribe.\nQUESTION: Well, if the tribe were operating a\ntrading post, would it be different?\nMR. CHAMBERS: It could well be different,\nJustice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chambers, you -- the tribe filed\nthis suit under section 1983. Is that correct?\nMR. CHAMBERS: It filed it under several --\nunder 1331 and 1983, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And one of the questions we have to\nanswer is whether the tribe is a person under section\n1983.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, if you -- yes, if the Court\ndecides that --\nQUESTION:\nwould address that point because the interpretive\npresumption is that the tribe, as a sovereign, which\nyou're so strongly urging here, is not a person under\nsection 1983. Why should we recognize that it's covered\nas a person under section 1983?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice O'Connor, you should do\nso because -- because section 1983 is a broad remedial\nstatute for violations of Federal rights by States.\nQUESTION: Well, does that mean we should just\ngo wild construing it for that reason?\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, Mr. Chief Justice. And I\ndon't think you have. I --\nQUESTION: I don't think we will.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, but -- but --\nQUESTION: But it doesn't include States?\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, it doesn't, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Why would it include the tribe?\nQUESTION: And it doesn't -- it doesn't include\nforeign governments. We said a couple of years ago\nParaguay couldn't bring a 1983 suit.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Yes, you did. You did in the\ncontext of a pretty late capital punishment --\nQUESTION: No, but I mean --\nMR. CHAMBERS:\nQUESTION: No. Sure, it was -- it was late in\nthe day for capital punishment. We were deciding a -- a\nquestion of -- of the meaning of section 1983, and I don't\nknow why that isn't good for your case too.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Souter, it's not good\nbecause there wasn't a history in 1871 of States impacting\nnegatively on States' Federal rights or on the Federal\nrights of foreign states and there was in the case of\nIndian tribes. This Court had decided in 1867 two cases\ncited in our brief involving the Kansas Indians and the\nNew York Indians, and the Court had decided the Cherokee\ncases about 30 years before where there were serious\nintrusions on tribes' Federal rights by States.\nSo Congress, when it enacted section 1983, was\nnot only presumptively aware of those, but in the 1870\ncommittee report relied on by the Government, by the\nSenate Judiciary Committee, specifically makes reference\nto the Kansas Indian case when it's considering whether\nIndians are citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and\nwhen they're not.\nQUESTION: But -- but you agree, I think, that\nthe tribe is not suable. Under -- as a defendant, the\ntribe is not amenable to 1983 as a defendant.\nMR. CHAMBERS: That -- that is correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nyou've held that States can sue as plaintiffs. You've\nheld that foreign nations can sue as plaintiffs. They\ncan't be sued as defendants under antitrust statutes. And\nI think in the Vermont Natural Resources Agency case on\nthe False Claim Act, you decided that while a State could\nnot be sued as a defendant under the False Claim Act, that\nit wouldn't necessarily preclude it from suing as a\nplaintiff.\nQUESTION: Mr. Chambers, I thought your -- your\nfirst position on this issue was that it was not raised\nbelow. You raised that in your brief in opposition to the\npetition. Are you abandoning that now?\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, I'm not, Justice Scalia. I'm\ntrying to answer the question --\nQUESTION: No, I understand that. But you --\nbut -- but you didn't mention a thing about it, and it was\nin your brief in opposition to the petition. It was also\nin your brief. You claim that the 1983 issue was not\nraised below.\nMR. CHAMBERS: And -- and should have been if\nit's going to be pressed to this Court. I -- I do agree\nwith that, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Then what is county's jurisdictional\nbasis? And don't tell me 1331 because it has to arise\nunder some law other than 1331.\nMR. CHAMBERS: I'm not going to tell you 1331.\nQUESTION: I don't mean the counties. I mean\nthe tribe.\nMR. CHAMBERS: No, no. It arises under Federal\ncommon law when sovereign immunity or the right to self-\ngovernment is being pleaded. And that's --\nQUESTION: And your -- and your best citation\nfor that proposition?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Two cases, Justice Kennedy: the\nNational Farmers Union v. Crow Tribe and the second Oneida\ncase, both in 1985.\nQUESTION: So is the injunctive relief -- I\nlooked at the declaratory relief in the complaint and it\ndidn't seem really directly on point. The -- the request\nfor declaratory relief had to do with the Gaming Act, law\n280, compacts, et cetera. So they didn't seem really to\nraise the question we now have. Then there's a section on\ndamages, which is 1983, and then some requests for\ninjunctive relief.\nMR. CHAMBERS: Justice Breyer, the -- the first\ncount in the complaint did raise the right of self-\ngovernance.\nQUESTION: Not the first request for relief.\nThe requests for relief -- there are five, and the first\ntwo have to do with the declaratory judgment. I think\nthey're not right on this point, but --\nMR. CHAMBERS: Okay. Well, I -- I think at\nleast the -- the count did do that and sovereign immunity\nwas pled in the complaint.\nAnd then also, the preemptions -- Supremacy\nClause issue that Ms. McDowell was mentioning in the\nGolden State Transit, I think, dissent by Justice Kennedy\ncites Gibbons v. Ogden and the Cooley case v. the Port of\nPhiladelphia, going back into the 19th century for the\nproposition --\nQUESTION: Those came up out of State courts,\nthough. They didn't come up through the Federal system.\nMR. CHAMBERS: I guess that's correct. I think\nthat -- yes, there wasn't Federal question jurisdiction in\nthat part of -- of the 19th century.\nQUESTION: So what -- the Federal question\njurisdiction you're saying is Federal common law.\nAnything else?\nMR. CHAMBERS: Well, I certainly think in\nfootnote 27 of our brief, we cited a number of Indian\ncases, the Chickasaw case, the Sac and Fox case, New\nMexico Apache Tribe v. Mescalero, where the Court had\nentertained similar claims under 1331.\nWe're only seeking here prospective injunctive\nand declaratory relief against the county, and we only\nbrought the action when they threatened the second search\nand seizure. We didn't do anything with the -- with the\nfirst intrusion. So -- so I would rely on -- on -- I\nmean, on -- on the number of cases where you have allowed\ntribes to bring preemption type claims against States\nwithout relying on section 1983, though -- though we do\nbelieve the compensatory damages are appropriate under\nsection 1983 also.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chambers.\nMr. Kirby, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KIRBY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KIRBY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would like to address very briefly the flip\nside, if you will, of the categorical rule being proposed\nby the tribe and the problems with that. And that flip\nside involves not the police power of the State, which we\nhave already talked about, but the constitutional rights\nof a defendant who is faced with criminal prosecution in a\nState court when that defendant feels there is exculpatory\nevidence in the possession of the tribe. For instance, it\nmay be a video surveillance of the parking lot or whatnot\nthat shows perhaps a self-defense defense for this\nparticular person.\nUnder the tribe's rule --\nQUESTION: It's odd for you to be raising a\ntribal member as a defendant when you have potential\ntribal members here who might be subject to suit. You\nseem a strange champion for such people.\nMR. KIRBY: It doesn't necessarily need to be a\ntribal member who might be a criminal defendant, Justice\nGinsburg. It could be anyone, a non-tribal member or even\na patron, who feels that there is exculpatory evidence\nthat the tribe possesses. And under the Sixth Amendment,\nthat person has the right to have the State issue\ncompulsory process to obtain that exculpatory evidence.\nUnder the tribe's rule that's being proposed,\nthe tribe would have the ability to trump the Sixth\nAmendment right of the accused in that situation and not\nproduce the exculpatory evidence. The tribe would also\nhave the right to trump the Fourteenth Amendment rights to\na fair trial of that particular person. And that's the\nflip side of the categorical rule that's being proposed\nand why we believe it's another reason it should not be\nadopted by this Court.\nWith regard to the 1983 action, I would like to\nsay that not only is the tribe not a person within the\nmeaning of the statute and the interpretive presumption\nthat this Court has set forth in, I believe, the Vermont\nAgency it was acknowledged. But also the right that the\ntribe is asserting, the right to self-governance, is not a\nFederal statutory right and it's not a constitutional\nright, and as such, it cannot support a 1983 action. And\nthat is another reason why 1983 provides no relief for the\ntribe in this case.\nIn -- in closing, I would like to say that this\ncase does not implicate traditional sovereign immunity\nwhich is sovereign immunity from civil suit. And there\nwas a question raised with regard to that, I believe by\nJustice Scalia, pointing out that the tribe's treasury is\nnot at issue here. It's not at stake here. What we're\ndealing with is process, in this case the criminal process\nof the court. And that's a totally different situation.\nThis Court has never addressed criminal process\nas being subject to tribal immunity. All of this Court's\ndecisions have addressed the tribe's immunity to civil\nlawsuit. That is not what we have here. The doctrine of\ntribal immunity should not be extended in this case to\ninclude criminal process for the reasons that we have set\nforth.\nWhile there may not be any wholly satisfactory\nresult, Justice Breyer, we believe that our position is\nthe best position.\neither of the two categorical approaches, simply even\nlooking at the rights of an accused and compulsory\nprocess, that should mitigate toward the county's position\nhere. We've also suggested a procedure, as presented by\nJustice White in Brendale, as being a potential resolution\nof this problem, maintaining the dignity of the tribe and\nalso allowing the State to exercise its police power and\nprotect its citizens as it investigates and prosecutes\ncrime.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kirby.\n"
