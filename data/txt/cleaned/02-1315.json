Joshua\nDavey.\nMs. Pierce.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NARDA PIERCE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. PIERCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTo preserve freedom of conscience for all\nits citizens in matters of religious faith and\nbelief, Washington's constitution limits the\ninvolvement of government. It limits both the\nability to regulate religious activities and to fund\nreligious activities.\nQUESTION: Do you think the fact that that\nprovision is in Washington's constitution makes it\ndifferent than, say, if it were in a -- simply in a\nstatute?\nMS. PIERCE: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nrecognition that this Court has given to a state\nconstitution, as opposed to a statute, is that it is\nadopted by all of the voters of the state. However,\nboth the constitution and the state laws are subject\nto Federal constitutional provisions. At issue today\nis our --\nQUESTION: Is -- is it a program at issue\nhere that provides basically money to the student to\nbe spent as the student wishes? Is it like a voucher\nprogram in that sense?\nMS. PIERCE: Justice O'Connor, the Promise\nScholarship is to be provided to the student for\npurposes of educational expenses and they're required\nto use it for certain educational expenses. The\npurpose of the Promise Scholarship established by the\nlegislature is to strengthen the length between --\nthe link between K-12 education and higher education,\nand in a recognition --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm just trying to find\nout how it works, whether it's like a voucher\nprogram, you give the money to the student and the\nstudent decides how to use it.\nMS. PIERCE: It -- it works like a voucher\nprogram to the extent that it's for educational\nexpenses. I'm not familiar with the specifics of\nvoucher programs, but the student is required to use\nit for those educational expenses.\nIt is not, for example, like a paycheck,\nwhere a person has those funds as their private funds\nand can dedicate those to any uses that they choose.\nAnd that's a key point under the Washington\nconstitution, because article I, section 11 says that\npublic funds shall not be applied to religious\nworship, exercise, or instruction --\nQUESTION: How -- how many states have\nsimilar provisions in their constitutions or laws?\nMS. PIERCE: It varies, Justice O'Connor,\naccording to the particular provisions. This\nprovision refers to not using public funds for\nreligious instruction. We also have a provision that\nno public funds shall be spent at schools under\nsectarian influence. I - I believe it's something in\nthe neighborhood of 36 states who have some\nprovisions relating to use of public funds for\nreligious instruction, but those vary.\nQUESTION: They were all adopted at about\nthe same time, weren't these so-called Blaine\nAmendments?\nMS. PIERCE: Your Honor, this is not the\nBlaine Amendment. The so-called Blaine Amendment are\nthose that refer to use of public funds in schools\nunder sectarian control. That's a different\nprovision of the Washington constitution. That's\narticle IX, section 4, and that was required by the\nenabling act that provided for our statehood, but\nthis is a different provision. It's a provision that\nwas separate and apart, that was debated, that was\nadded to Washington's constitution as a separate\nprovision.\nQUESTION: And was that --\nQUESTION: So this was add -- this was\nadded after Washington was admitted in 1889?\nMS. PIERCE: No, Your -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, I'm sorry -- it was at the same time of\nadoption, but it was not the provision that was\nrequired by the --\nQUESTION: The enabling.\nMS. PIERCE: -- enabling act. It was not\nin the original proposed constitution set before the\nframers. And during the course of that\nconstitutional convention, that's where this language\nwas added.\nAnd I know, referring to the Blaine\nAmendments, there's been much made in the briefs of\nwhether or not those amendments stemmed from\nanti-Catholic motivation. There's certainly no\nevidence in Washington that there was any discussion,\nany evidence of anti-Catholic motive.\nIn Washington, both article I, section 11\nand article IX, section 4, which is -- more directly\nstems from the Blaine Amendment, Federal level,\nthey've always been implemented in a\nnon-discriminatory manner, prohibiting both the\npractice of any religion of any sort in our public\nschools, as well as any funding for private sectarian\nschools.\nQUESTION: But what if -- what if a state\nprohibited only the study of theology from a Catholic\nperspective? Would that survive?\nMS. PIERCE: No, Your Honor, we don't\nbelieve it would. But what the state has done here\nis prohibited public funds for religious instruction\nwherever it occurs, including in a college --\nQUESTION: Wait. How -- how do you\nreconcile that? That's what I don't understand. It\nseems to me that if you say it does not violate the\nreligion clauses to prohibit the use for any\nreligious instruction whatever, you would also have\nto say that it does not violate the religion clauses\nto say no public funds shall be spent for Jewish\ntheology studies.\nWhy -- why -- I mean, the state is not\npermitted to discriminate between religious sects,\nbut it's just as much not permitted to discriminate\nbetween religion in general and non-religion. So how\ncan you possibly -- I mean, if we say that -- that\nyou can do this, it seems to me, we have to say you\n-- you can also prohibit Jewish studies.\nMS. PIERCE: No, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMS. PIERCE: -- I don't believe that\nfollows. The line between funds for secular purposes\nand for religious purposes is a line that's been\nrecognized by this Court in various funding cases and\nin reviewing government activities. It's a line that\nrecognizes both the values of the Establishment\nClause and the values of the Free Exercise Clause.\nHere, simply because the State of\nWashington is extending those values of the\nEstablishment Clause beyond direct funding into\nindirect funding does not convert those values into\nhostility. There's still the values --\nQUESTION: It's -- it's treating --\nMS. PIERCE: -- of protecting religious\nfreedom.\nQUESTION: -- it's treating religion\ndifferently from non-religion. You can study\nanything you like and get it subsidized except\nreligion. Why is that not violating the principle of\nneutrality?\nMS. PIERCE: It is treating religion\ndifferent from a realm in which religion -- religious\nbelief or non-belief does not enter what we refer to\nas secular studies. It's --\nQUESTION: You're making the -- are you --\nare you making the -- or is Washington making the\ndistinction between training in how to be religious,\ntraining as it were in the practice of some -- of a\nreligion that leads to the truth, on the one hand,\nand study about what people believe on the other\nhand. I thought that was the distinction, how to be\nreligious versus what religions believe. Is that the\ndistinction?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. PIERCE: And that was the distinction\nI meant to articulate.\nQUESTION: So, I take it, then, if it\nthat's the distinction, you would -- you would agree\nthat if Washington funded a school of atheism, but\nwouldn't fund a school like this one, that there\nwould be a violation of one or both of the clauses?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice Souter, because\nwhenever you enter into the realm of faith or belief,\nwhenever you try to affect someone's belief in that\nrealm, that has been a particularly protected realm\nof individual conscience, that becomes religious,\nwhether it's non-belief or belief. It's when you --\nQUESTION: But it's the difference between\nbeing religious and studying religion. That's your\nline, isn't it?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Your Honor, and I\nbelieve that's the Court's line. It's the line\nthat's been drawn in many of the direct funding cases\nof this Court, to teach about religion --\nQUESTION: Can -- can you not study\natheism under this statute? Suppose there is a\ncourse debunking, debunking all religious belief.\nWould that be prohibited? Would that be funded under\nthis statute? I don't see any -- any prohibition of\nthe funding of that?\nMS. PIERCE: Justice Scalia, I think when\nthe statute is read in conjunction with Washington\ncase law, and particularly the Calvary Bible\nPresbyterian Church case, that the definition --\nQUESTION: What does the statute say? I\ndon't see how it can possibly apply to that. What\ndoes it say?\nMS. PIERCE: Well, the statute says that\nno aid shall be awarded to any student pursuing a\ndegree in theology.\nQUESTION: In theology.\nMS. PIERCE: But --\nQUESTION: Now, is -- is a degree in\natheism a degree in theology?\nMS. PIERCE: I believe it would be under\nthe interpretation --\nQUESTION: That would be a question, would\nit not, for the state supreme court to decide? It\nmay decide it needs to carry that limitation in order\nto be compatible with the Free Exercise Clause.\nMS. PIERCE: I --\nQUESTION:\nFree Exercise Clause answers the question, can you\ngive it to the Catholics but not to the Jews. So\nthat's -- that's not an issue.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I\nthink that the Washington Supreme Court would\ninterpret it that way, not only to be consistent with\nthe Free Exercise Clause, but to be consistent with\nits own state constitutional provision and its\npurposes, which is to not use public funds for\ninstruction in the realm of faith and belief and --\nQUESTION: What cases do you cite for the\nproposition that you're asserting that the -- that\nthe Free Exercise Clause or the Establishment Clause\napplies differently to discrimination between\ndifferent religions than it does to discrimination\nbetween religion in general and non-religion? What\n-- what cases do you cite for that distinction?\nMS. PIERCE: What we cite, Your Honor, is\nthat line between the secular and the religious\nactivity. I believe it's the line that was drawn in\nthe Schempp case, referring to the study about\nreligion versus the study of religion, which is not,\nin our view, discrimination in the classic sense of\nthat word.\nQUESTION:\nthe issue there was whether you were discriminating\nagainst religion or not. And since you are not\nprohibiting study about religion, that isn't the\nquestion here.\nThe question is, assuming you are\ndiscriminating between religion and non-religion, you\ncan't study theology but you can study anything else,\nwhat is there in our cases that says that is okay,\nalthough it would not be okay to distinguish between\nJewish studies or Catholic studies or Protestant\nstudies and other studies?\nI don't know a single case that says the\nprinciple of neutrality somehow applies differently\nso long as you're discriminating against all religion\nthan it does when you're just discriminating against\none denomination. Did you have a case?\nMS. PIERCE: Well, Your Honor, in the\ncontext of this Court's aid to education under the\nEstablishment Clause, and Mitchell v. Helms is a\nclassic example, there's a distinction between\nproviding materials, educational materials that are\nto be used in secular education, as opposed to those\nmaterials that might be diverted to religious,\nideological education and --\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's the\nEstablishment Clause, isn't it, in Mitchell against\nHelms?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, it is, Your Honor, and\n-- and we believe the same -- many of the same values\nunderlie the Washington constitution. And we don't\nbelieve that the distinction is made invalid because\nit is extended to indirect funding and doesn't apply\nonly to direct funding.\nQUESTION: Well, I wanted to ask you about\nthese values. As I understand, this student could\nhave done exactly what he in fact did if only he did\nnot declare a double major. He could have taken all\nof these religious perspective courses, if only he'd\ncalled his major business administration, which in\nfact it was because he had the credits for that, too.\nThat would have been permissible. Is that correct,\nor am I incorrect?\nMS. PIERCE: Well, the statute focuses on\nwhether a student is pursuing a degree in theology\nand -- and --\nQUESTION: If -- suppose that he pursued a\ndegree in business administration and yet, ancillary\nto that or as options, took all of these other\ncourses. Could he have had the aid that he seeks?\nMS. PIERCE:\nthat could have happened, but it's an unlikely --\nQUESTION: All right. What is the state's\ninterest in denying him aid simply because he\ndeclares a double major?\nMS. PIERCE: I believe the reason the\nlegislature has focused on the nature of the degree\nprogram is because it's an inherently religious\nprogram, and if they were to --\nQUESTION: What is the state's interest in\ndenying him funds simply because of the way he labels\nthe major he chooses, if all the other instructions,\nall the other elements of the case are the same? He\ntakes all the same courses, he has all the same\ncommitment as a Christian, and yet he's denied the\nrelief in one case and given it -- the subsidy in one\ncase, and given it in the other. What is the state's\ninterest in doing that?\nMS. PIERCE: Justice Kennedy, I think the\nstate's interest is not in that particular student,\nbut in how you administer it overall. And the way\nthe state administers it overall, in order to avoid a\nclass-by-class, student-by-student determination, is\nto look at the degree programs that are inherently\nreligious that have, or ask the universities actually\nto do that --\nQUESTION: Ms. Pierce, I thought that the\n--\nQUESTION: Well, what is the state's\ninterest in -- in denying aid for programs that are\ninherently religious? What is that interest? Is it\na compelling interest?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Your Honor, we believe\nit is. The interest is --\nQUESTION: May I ask you just to clarify\nwhat I thought was the purpose of this, was that the\nstate has decided it does not want to fund the\ntraining of clergymen, and it cites a long history of\nthat. And it's tried to be as accommodating as it\ncan with that limitation.\nI mean, certainly if what you're doing is\nvulnerable, it would be no less vulnerable if the\nstate said, well, we won't fund that school at all\nbecause it's an evangelical school.\nMS. PIERCE: Justice Ginsburg -- excuse me\n-- the focus is on the religious nature of the\ninstruction. If someone had a career goal to enter\nthe clergy and yet took a secular course of\neducation, they would not be denied funding.\nCertainly one of the underlying values of\nour Freedom of Religion Clauses at the Federal and\nstate level is not to require people to support the\npromotion of a doctrine or religious belief with\nwhich they may not agree, and that, returning to\nJustice Kennedy's question, is -- is the interest.\nThe way it's implemented by Washington,\nand it has been by Congress and by other states in\nother contexts, is to look at that core course of\nstudy because --\nQUESTION: But we've decided in Witters\nthat it's unnecessary to do that to conform to the\nEstablishment Clause.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: So, after -- after that, then\nwhat is the state's interest at this point?\nMS. PIERCE: Well, the state's --\nQUESTION: Is the state's interest in\nredefining the Establishment Clause?\nMS. PIERCE: No, Your Honor, but the state\nhas a different, although somewhat concurrent, scheme\nfor religious freedom, and that involves not just\navoiding a government endorsement of religion, which\nis what the Establishment Clause primarily turns and\nfocuses on --\nQUESTION: But Witters said there is no\nendorsement.\nMS. PIERCE: And -- and --\nQUESTION: So you can't use that.\nMS. PIERCE: No, and I'm not trying to.\nQUESTION: I still don't see what your\ninterest is, and once you do define it, I want you to\ntell me if it's compelling, rational basis.\nMS. PIERCE: Okay. Washington's interest\nexpressed in 1889 was to protect the freedom of\nconscience of all its citizens, and that included not\ncompelling its citizens to provide enforced public\nfunds to support the promotion of religious beliefs\nwith which they may or may not agree. I think --\nQUESTION: Does that mean that the state\ncan decline to provide fire protection to churches\nand synagogues?\nMS. PIERCE: No, Your Honor, and that\ndistinction has been made.\nQUESTION: And Washington doesn't do that,\ndoes it?\nMS. PIERCE: It does not decline that, and\nthere's --\nQUESTION: So that -- that general public\nbenefit is extended to both religious and\nnon-religious institutions equivalently, and people\ndon't get upset about that, do they?\nMS. PIERCE: No, Your Honor. I think\nproviding the essential services that include people\nas part of our civilized community has been\ndistinguished from other kind of funding when these\nquestions are asked.\nQUESTION: Well, Washington's position, I\ntake it, is that, although it -- it will certainly\nput out the fire in the church, it won't spend money\nfor the purpose of persuading people that they ought\nto be inside the church. Is that the -- the point\nyou're making?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice Souter. There\nis a distinction there and it's a distinction that's\nbeen made in a variety of contexts, but --\nQUESTION: And you're saying that even\nthough it would not offend the Establishment Clause\nif the state did provide this sort of funding, there\nis still, I think your point is, there is still an\narea within which it has a choice, even though that\nchoice may not be determined by the Establishment\nClause?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Your Honor, because the\npurpose of the state constitution, which of course,\nwhen it was adopted in 1889, was not viewed as\ngreater than the Establishment Clause, it was viewed\nas the only protection for religious freedom at the\nstate level, since it wasn't until 1947 that the\nEstablishment Clause was held to apply to the states.\nAnd to return to your question, Justice\nSouter, the distinction between providing police and\nfire services to an organization and providing\nfunding to assist in the educational purpose of that\norganization was made in Norwood v. Harrison in this\nCourt. In the very different circumstance, but for\n-- for similar reasons, this Court held that\ntextbooks could not be provided to segregated schools\nbecause that would aid the discrimination of those\nschools in violation of --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that an\nEstablishment Clause issue?\nMS. PIERCE: In that particular --\nQUESTION: It's been litigated under the\nEstablishment Clause, right?\nMS. PIERCE: The provision of the -- the\naid --\nQUESTION: Providing textbooks or other\naid to religious schools. Those have been\nEstablishment Clause challenges, and we had a -- the\nWitters case from your state, and determined that the\nEstablishment Clause is not violated by giving aid to\nthe blind, which is used then to study for the\nministry, right?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and\nthat's because under the Establishment Clause, the\nquestion is, is the government endorsing religion?\nUnder Washington's article I, section 11, the\nquestion is, is -- are public funds being used for\nthe promotion or -- of religious belief or disbelief\nand --\nQUESTION: But do you -- do you think that\n--\nQUESTION: Ms. Pierce, may I ask you a\nquestion there on how you draw the line? Because I\nwant to get clear on one thing, and it was raised in\neffect by the questions earlier about the Blaine\nAmendment, I guess, but is my understanding correct\nthat the State of -- that this clause that we are\ndealing with here, and nothing else for that matter\nin the Washington law, forbids the state from paying\n-- we'll call it a tuition voucher here -- that is\ngoing to a sectarian school like this one, so long as\nit's not being used for theological education?\nMS. PIERCE: Justice Souter, there's a\ndistinction in our state constitution --\nQUESTION:\nis nothing that forbids that? In other words, going\nback to Justice Kennedy's question, if this same\nstudent said, I want to study business and I want to\nstudy it at this sectarian school, there would be no\nimpediment in Washington law to paying him the -- or\ngiving him the voucher or whatever you call it and\nletting him spend it at this sectarian school? Is\nthat correct?\nMS. PIERCE: That's true at the higher\neducation level.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: But isn't it also true he could\neven take the same courses and get it as long as he\ndidn't declare his major until he was a junior?\nMS. PIERCE: Your Honor, we -- the statute\nsays pursuing a degree in theology, so I think it\nshould be properly read and is properly read by\nNorthwest College as a student who is, during the\nacademic terms that are funded, working toward that\ndegree in theology.\nQUESTION: But I -- I just want to be sure\nI understand how it works in response to Justice\nKennedy's inquiry. Is it not true that he could have\ntaken all or most of the religious courses he did\ntake if he'd only declared a different major or\npostponed the time when he declared his major?\nMS. PIERCE: I believe he --\nQUESTION: Which has a double aspect. In\none hand, as Justice Kennedy points out, the state\ninterest doesn't seem all that compelling there, but\non the other hand, the burden on him is also pretty\nslight, because all he had to was take a -- just\nmanage his curriculum a little differently.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Your Honor. I --\nQUESTION: And -- and I just want to know,\nam I correct that he could have taken either all or\nsubstantially all of the religion -- religious\ncourses and qualified for the scholarship if he just\ndeclared a different major?\nMS. PIERCE: You're partially correct,\nJustice Stevens. I think he could have taken some of\nthe same religion courses. I don't think just simply\ndeclaring your major later is what meets the purpose\nof the statute. The statute says are you pursuing --\nQUESTION: Wasn't he counseled -- wasn't\nhe counseled specifically by the school to be honest?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: And not try to hide what his\npurpose was, which he was perfectly open about?\nMS. PIERCE:\nQUESTION: And, of course, if -- if you\ntake a whole bunch of religious courses, it may be\nthey can't be counted for some other major other than\nthe -- the theology.\nMS. PIERCE: Well, the theology degree,\nYour Honor, does require, I believe at Northwest, 125\ncredits, and 79 of those credits are required to be\nin various Bible and theological courses, so I think\nit is -- it would be possible, but unusual, for\nanother student to have those same courses and not\nbeing pursuing a degree in theology.\nQUESTION: Could we go back to Justice\nKennedy's second part of what he was asking, because\nit's bothering me, too. I think it's absolutely\nwell-established, whether there's a case or not, that\npeople have thought it's different when what the\nFederal government or state government says is, what\nwe have here is a secular program, we're paying for\nsecular programs, whether it's schools or social\nservices or any one of a million things, or if it\nwere to say, well, it's a Baptist program, but not a\nCatholic program.\nI think if they said the second, they'd\nhave to pass something like strict scrutiny as far as\ntheir reasons are concerned.\nthe first, so far I don't think they would have to\npass anything like that kind of test, but that's the\nquestion.\nAnd I think that Justice Kennedy was\nsaying, very well, what is the test? What kind of\nscrutiny should you give under the Equal Protection\nClause, where what the state has done is said we have\na secular spending program. Now, leave the atheist,\nbecause if the atheist is a program which concerns\nprinciples that in the mind of the atheist are\nsimilar to those that are religious in the mind of a\nreligious person, I'm willing to call that a\nreligious program. That's not what I'm talking\nabout.\nI'm talking about just a regular secular\naid program. What do we judge that distinction on\nthe basis of? What kind of a test?\nMS. PIERCE: Justice Breyer, I believe it\nis a rational basis test, that is, it is a neutral\nline, it's a recognized line between the secular that\ndoes not involve the realm of belief and faith, and a\nreligious that does.\nQUESTION: I didn't think this was an\nEqual Protection Clause case at all. I thought it\nwas -- the challenge was freedom of religion.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it\nis, and --\nQUESTION: The Free Exercise Clause of the\nFirst Amendment?\nMS. PIERCE: That is the question on which\ncert was granted, and --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. PIERCE: -- because it is a neutral\nline --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm thinking of free\nexercise, but I'm thinking this is a discrimination\ncase, so maybe it's totally different under free\nexercise, but you see the question.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, and Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: And your answer's rational\nbasis.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Rational -- you -- you think\nthere's a difference in free exercise if what the\nstate says is, we are burdening the free exercise of\nall religions, as opposed to, we are burdening the\nfree exercise of one particular religion. You think\nthere's a different -- a different standard? Again,\nI would ask for the case that -- that suggests that.\nMS. PIERCE:\ninstance, this case involves application of public\nfunds in a funding program, and we believe that the\nprinciple that a state's decision not to fund the\nexercise of a fundamental right is not a burden on\nthat right, it's not an infringement on that right.\nAll that the State of Washington has done here is\ndecline to fund theology studies --\nQUESTION: Certainly in our -- in our\nRosenberger case there was a rational basis for what\nthe University of Virginia did, but we held it\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause.\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nthe purpose of the public forum principles that were\napplied in Rosenberger are to protect the open public\nforum. There the Court specifically acknowledged\nthat that was a forum for the publication, for the\nexpression of ideas, and that the expression of those\nideas in that open public forum would be incomplete\nif certain viewpoints were excluded.\nBut certainly the purpose of the Promise\nScholarship is not to open a public forum. It's more\nakin to the American Library Association case, where\nInternet access was provided, not to provide a forum\nfor the Web publishers, but to promote education and\nlearning.\nQUESTION: You think there is a -- a\nrational basis suffices for the state to prohibit\nthis student from declaring one of his legitimate\nmajors?\nMS. PIERCE: We believe -- yes, Your\nHonor, we believe there is a rational basis to not\nfund religious instruction wherever it occurs,\nincluding a theology course.\nQUESTION: Is it essentially your position\nthat not everything that is compatible with the\nEstablishment Clause, not everything that the state\ncould do under the Establishment Clause, it must do\nunder the Free Exercise? And if that's your\nposition, how do you define the space in between\nthose two where the state has a choice?\nMS. PIERCE: That is our position. We\ndon't think states should be in constitutional\npincers where whatever they're allowed to do under\nthe Establishment Clause or required to do,\nparticularly given the history that states have come\nto their own path to religious freedom.\nAnd I think applying the various\nprinciples on when you burden the exercise of\nreligious freedom leads you to the latitude in this\narea.\nor burden a fundamental right, and that's all that\nthe state has done. Mr. Chief Justice, I'd --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Pierce. You're\nreserving your time.\nMr. Sekulow.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SEKULOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn the free exercise context, this Court\nhas held that the minimum requirement of neutrality\nis that a law not discriminate on its face. That's\nclearly what is taking place here, and I'd like to\nput in context exactly how the implementation of the\nstatutory program works. Washington, when they\nadopted the Promise Scholarship program and how it's\napplied, works this way.\nA student applies for this general grant.\nIn this particular case, Josh Davey applied for the\ngrant when he was aware of it in the summer, was\nnotified by the state that he was qualified and\naccepted in the program in August. At that point he\nenrolled at Northwest College, which is an accredited\nand eligible institution. It was not until -- and he\ndeclared his major, the dual major, at that point in\nbusiness administration and the pastoral ministries\ndegree.\nTwo months later, it was two months until\nhe was notified by the financial aid office through a\nmemorandum that the state circulated that after\nreviewing the Promise Scholarship program, the state\nthen decided that in fact there would be a\nprohibition put in place on pursuing a degree in\ntheology and that state has interpreted that to mean\npursuing a degree in theology from a religious\nperspective.\nThe check, Justice O'Connor, is sent\ndirectly to the student. The school is the -- in the\nsense the school gets the check and hands it to the\nstudent. It's not written to the school. The school\ncannot use it for -- to -- a private institution\ncannot use it at all for any expenditure. They can't\ncredit, they can't debit the account. The school\nmerely verifies that the student's enrolled. The\ncheck then goes to the student. It can be used for\nany --\nQUESTION: So it wouldn't violate the\nEstablishment Clause, but I guess what we're\naddressing is whether there's a free exercise\nviolation.\nMR. SEKULOW: Right.\nQUESTION: How does this violate the\nstudent's right to free exercise of religion? Maybe\nit's more expensive to go to school, but why does\nthat violate his free exercise of religion right?\nMR. SEKULOW: Joshua Davey, and the state\nhas acknowledged this, of course, has the free\nexercise right to pursue a degree in theology. The\nquestion here is the burden that's placed on it. Of\ncourse, two responses. With regard to the actual\nburden, here a general benefit was available to a\nstudent and a religious classification was utilized\nto deny the student access to those funds. He met\nthe criteria.\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you this.\nMR. SEKULOW: Sure.\nQUESTION: Suppose a state has a school\nvoucher program such as the Court indicated could be\nupheld in the Zelman case. Now, if the state decides\nnot to give school vouchers for use in religious or\nparochial schools, do you take the position it must,\nthat it has to do one or the other? It can have a\nvoucher program, but if it does, it has to fund all\nprivate and religious schools with a voucher program?\nMR. SEKULOW: No, I think --\nQUESTION: Is that your position?\nMR. SEKULOW: No. The state --\nQUESTION: Well, why not? I mean, why\nwouldn't it follow from what you are saying today?\nMR. SEKULOW: For this reason. The state\ncan set neutral and eligible criteria for admission\nas an eligible institution. Here it was\naccreditation. Now, if the religious school, the\nschool that was affiliated with the religious\ndenomination met the general neutral eligibility\nrequirement, and there was no countervailing\nEstablishment Clause problems, yes, then it should --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't know what you\nmean. The state says all schools were going to have\na program to give vouchers for use in all schools of\na certain grade level, assuming the teachers are\nqualified to be teachers.\nMR. SEKULOW: That --\nQUESTION: Can they refrain from making\nthat program available for use in religious schools?\nMR. SEKULOW: I -- I would think not. I\nthink once it would go towards the private schools,\nas long as the eligibility --\nQUESTION: So what you're urging here\nwould have a major impact, then, would it not, on --\non voucher programs?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, it would. I think a\nvoucher program could be established that has a\nneutral criteria and if the private schools meet that\ncriteria, including the private religious schools and\nthere is no countervailing Establishment Clause\nproblem, I wouldn't see any reason --\nQUESTION: Well, but the only criteria\nthat they have --\nQUESTION: Sure -- surely, the state can\ndecide to fund only public schools.\nMR. SEKULOW: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And it's only when it starts\nfunding some private schools that you get into the\nreligious question.\nMR. SEKULOW: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But I'm -- I'm concerned --\nQUESTION: But you say if they publish any\nprivate school they must publish -- they must support\nall religious schools as well.\nMR. SEKULOW: No. Again, I think if they\nmeet the accreditation standard, if the program were\nto --\nQUESTION: But they could not just say we\n-- we will publish all private schools except\nsectarian schools.\nMR. SEKULOW: I don't think they could do\nthat. No, I think it would be --\nQUESTION: That's the issue here, yeah.\nQUESTION: Even though there -- there are\nquite a few state laws and constitutional provisions\naround the country that -- that provide just that,\naren't there?\nMR. SEKULOW: There are. Thirty-seven\nstates have --\nQUESTION: Yeah. So the decision here\ncould have very broad impact, I assume.\nMR. SEKULOW: Interesting, Justice\nO'Connor, and admittedly, this is a bit of a moving\ntarget because state policies change, but there are\napproximately 37 states that have this type of\namendment. Twenty-five of those states have programs\nof aid that do not have a discriminatory basis upon\nreligion. It's given to any accredited --\nQUESTION: Mr. Sekulow?\nMR. SEKULOW: Yes.\nQUESTION: May I ask you the question that\nI asked Ms. Pierce, because I think this is really\nwhat the case turns on. Is there any space between\nwhat one, what a state is permitted to do, what it's\npermitted to fund under the Establishment Clause and\nwhat it must fund under the Free Exercise Clause, and\nif so, what fills that space? You've been candid in\nsaying voucher, no. If you -- going to give to any\nprivate school, you can't leave out the parochial\nschools. You certainly said that about this program.\nMR. SEKULOW: Yes.\nQUESTION: Suppose the -- the state would\nsay, we are going to fund professional education,\nlawyers, doctors, architects, engineers, but we're\nnot going to fund people who are -- who are in a\ndivinity program. Would that qualify or would that\nfall also?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, I think a program that\nwere to just limit it to specific professions would\nnot necessarily have to go towards theology. For\ninstance, in a lot of states using that example,\nJustice Ginsburg, there is a shortage of nurses right\nnow. And if the state were to adopt a program to\nfund education for nurses that included public and\nprivate schools, they don't have to bring theology --\nQUESTION: No, but it would include -- my\nprogram includes all professions, save one, and --\nand that is ministry.\nMR. SEKULOW:\ndescribed it, I would be here arguing the same point\nin this context. The idea that you would list all of\nthe professions and then say we are going to fund\neverything but those students studying theology would\nbe again that religious classification, and I would\nthink unless the state could establish its compelling\ngovernmental interest --\nQUESTION: As I -- as I understand your\nanswer to Justice O'Connor, if we decide in your\nfavor, we necessarily commit ourselves to the\nproposition that an elementary and secondary school\nvoucher program must include religious schools if it\nincludes any other private schools. It -- it seems\nto me that your case can be resolved on a much\nnarrower issue than that. Here we have a -- a\ncollege student who is being required to surrender\nhis -- his conscientious beliefs by declaring a major\nwhich otherwise would have been completely funded by\nthe school, and I -- I just don't see any interest in\ndoing that. It seems to me a -- a very severe\nviolation of -- of religious conscience. I think\nthat's quite different from an overall neutrality\nprinciple, which would foreclose this Court on the\nvoucher issue.\nMR. SEKULOW:\nagree, Justice Kennedy. I don't think the Court has\nto go that far here.\nQUESTION: But why isn't --\nQUESTION: But certainly that's what\nyou're arguing. I mean, your -- your brief and your\npresentation certainly urges us to go that route.\nMR. SEKULOW: If --\nQUESTION: Now, have we -- have we, in\nlooking at funding issues, have we dealt differently\nwith the requirement of funding something out of\npublic funds than for other purposes?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well -- well, certainly in\nthe -- in the direct aid cases and in the\nEstablishment Clause context, but this is very\nsimilar to the Witters program, so there is not the\ncountervailing Establishment Clause issue, and that's\nwhat I was going to address, Justice Kennedy.\nDepending on how the voucher program is established\nwould depend on whether the religious institutions\nwould be included. For instance, again I go to the\neligibility issue. Here, Northwest College was an\naccredited institution --\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's assume that all\nthe public schools and all the private schools,\nincluding all religious private schools are -- are\naccredited in whatever way the state accredits them,\nand that the criterion, apart from religious\neducation, is simply that the ultimate recipient of\nthe voucher has to be an accredited school. It seems\nto me, following Justice O'Connor's question, that\nthe argument that would be made in any case in which\na state says we will -- we will allow a voucher to be\nspent in a private school, but not a private\nreligious school is the same argument that Justice\nKennedy was suggesting a moment ago, and that is that\nthe religious student must somehow surrender a\nconscientious belief and go from a religious school\nand seek to be enrolled in a non-religious private\nschool or a public one to get the voucher. And I\ndon't see why that argument would not be just as\napplicable there as the argument that you are making\nhere.\nMR. SEKULOW: Justice Souter, in this\nparticular -- using that example, here the school is\na qualified school. The Northwest College, which\nadmittedly has a religious affiliation, it isn't --\nQUESTION: Sure. That's a wash.\nEverybody agrees.\nMR. SEKULOW: It's their major.\nQUESTION:\nis, will we fund religious training in how to be\nreligion -- religious -- or will we not? And in\nfact, a -- a similar argument would be made as\nbetween the -- the religious school that teaches\nreligion, and the private school that doesn't teach\nreligion.\nMR. SEKULOW: In this context, the way the\nprogram is implemented within that hypothetical and\nwithin the facts here, here students can take these\nvery same courses in religion that Josh Davey --\nQUESTION: Well, that may show that the\nstate draws a kind of a funny line. Maybe it was a\n-- a bad job of line drawing, and I -- I have to\nadmit, I'm not quite sure why they draw it the way\nthey do, but on -- on the -- on the basic proposition\nthat the state raises as -- as its position here,\nthat it will not fund ministerial education or\neducation in how to be religious versus funding other\nkinds of training, the argument, it seems to me, from\nthe Free Exercise Clause would be the same in the\nvoucher case as the argument that you are making\nhere.\nMR. SEKULOW: If in fact the programs were\nput forward this way with the accreditation as you\nsuggested, and there is no countervailing\nEstablishment Clause issue and the eligibility issue\nof the school is met, yes, I wouldn't see the --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. SEKULOW: -- justification to exclude a\nparticular major here in this particular case, a\nsubmajor from a religious viewpoint.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sekulow --\nQUESTION: Well, how many states do that,\ndo you know? You're knowledgeable on these things.\nHow many states have voucher programs which -- which\nwould allow students to go to any private school, you\nknow, an elite academy, but not allow them to go to\nreligious schools?\nMR. SEKULOW: Twenty-five states have\nvoucher-type programs that have no restrictions at\nall as long as it's an accredited institution, so\nthat's the -- usually the standard. They can go to\nany school that's accredited. There are some states,\nand it's about a half-dozen, as I said, Justice\nScalia, it's a little bit of a moving target because\npolicies change, that actually have this prohibition\nfor religious education, and even within some of\nthose states, the programs are inconsistent. They'll\nhave different type of financial aid programs here.\nIn this particular situation, and the way\nthis particular program is implemented, though,\nJoshua Davey had already made, Justice Stevens, his\ndeclaration of a major before he was notified he was\ndisqualified. The state didn't do the formal\nnotification until October, some two months after he\nrolled -- enrolled.\nQUESTION: But I suppose he could have\nchanged his mind and taken another major in most of\nthe courses and then postponed that decision. As a\nmatter of conscience, he didn't do it.\nMR. SEKULOW: It -- it was a matter of\nconscience. There were some students at the school\nthat did change their mind. There were two that did\nnot. Joshua Davey was one that -- and the counselor,\nthe financial aid counselor, did state in the joint\nappendix that she cautioned them if they are in fact\ngoing to major in a degree that would be pursuing a\ntheology to tell the truth, which he clearly did\nhere. So his implementation of the decision was\nalready made in the sense that the state came back\nafterwards and said oh, by the way, these group of\nstudents don't qualify for this.\nQUESTION: But wouldn't it be --\nQUESTION: Am I -- am I correct or\nincorrect that the state would fund a student who\nmajored in literature at a institution which was\nsectarian and had instructors who taught literature\nfrom a religious perspective or -- am I correct about\nthat?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Well, but the state is saying,\nI don't know if we can escape the broader ground, the\nstate's saying, look, we understand that, you know,\napplying our standard there'll be all kinds of\nanomalies that you can get. Maybe this case is one.\nBut what we're doing by and large is to say, we don't\nwant to spend too much of our state money in this\nprogram, we'll do it subsidiary, you know, the odd\nexample doesn't matter, but people who major in\nphilosophy are likely to become priests or at least\nspend a lot of time studying theology. If they major\nin theology, or they spend a lot of time studying\ntheology, that's going too far. So this is, like\nmany administrative lines, a very crude effort to\nidentify those people who are taking too much of\ntheir time in totally religiously-oriented matters.\nNow, of course that's unconstitutional if\nwe accept your argument that the state must treat the\nreligious study the same way as any other. That's\nyour broad ground.\nground, I don't quite see at the moment how we can\naccept the narrow one, which turns on these details\nof the administrability of the line.\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, the reason that I want\n-- let me address the latter, if I might, Justice\nBreyer. The reason those details matter because the\nline drawing albeit may be crude on the State of\nWashington, here is within the context of the Free\nExercise Clause, because here the school is an\neligible institution, so that's not even at issue.\nThere is no countervailing Establishment Clause issue\nhere. Witters foreclosed that. So all we are\ndealing with is a statute which on its face states\nthat a student who qualifies based on academic\nexcellence and economic need makes the decision for\nhim or herself where they're going to go to school\nand what they're going to major in, and they can\nmajor in literally the universe of courses. There is\nonly one exclusion. It's not even, Justice Ginsburg,\na situation with a number of majors. It's one.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sekulow, I think that\nJustice Breyer is getting at the same point I tried\nto get at, and it's in part the other flip side of\nwhat Justice Kennedy asked you. Certainly, you are\nnot standing here to tell us that, oh, if they were\nmore restrictive, if they said we're simply not going\nto fund scholarships to students who go to sectarian\nschools, that that might be all right. I mean, you\ndon't want to win on the ground of the school was too\ngenerous in what it did fund.\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, two responses. First,\nthe -- on the issue of the state and their\nobligation, to recast this as a -- the state is being\nrequired to fund Joshua Davey's education, I think is\n-- is a miscast of the issue. The state has decided\nto employ, to develop a scholarship program that's\nvery broad-based and in that program they have given\nthe student the ultimate choice of where they could\ngo to school as long as it's within Washington state\nand accredited and literally they can major in any\nmajor except for one, and that is a theology\nexclusion.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't be any better if they\nsaid, you can go to any school except a -- a church\nschool.\nMR. SEKULOW: No. I think it would raise,\nif it's accredited I think it would raise the same\nproblem. But it's not to say that the state\nuniversities don't teach courses in theology and\nreligion.\nthere's a listing of the courses offered at the\nUniversity of Washington, and it covers a broad array\nof religious courses, albeit from --\nQUESTION: You -- you don't know of any\ncase that says that the less significant the interest\nthe state has is the more latitude it has in\ndiscriminating against religion. You don't know of\nany case that said that?\nMR. SEKULOW: No. That -- that would --\nQUESTION: I hope you don't, yeah.\nMR. SEKULOW: No. And hopefully this\nwon't be that one.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: May I ask -- ask you a broader\nquestion? A number of the briefs discussed the\nbreathing space between the Establishment Clause and\nthe Free Exercise Clause. Do you take the position,\nor just what is your position on whether or not there\nis such a breathing space?\nMR. SEKULOW: The play in the joints as\nit's referred to.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. SEKULOW: I -- I think the play in the\njoints gives the state broad flexibility in\nestablishing the programs and -- or not establishing\na program at all, but to use the play in the joints\nto not accommodate religion but rather to target\nreligion as an exclusion I think is a misuse in my\nview of what the Court has at this point --\nQUESTION: Give me an example, any\nexample.\nQUESTION: But do you go so far as to\ncontend that any violation, any time there is no\nviolation of the Establishment Clause that then the\nFree Exercise Clause would necessarily kick in?\nMR. SEKULOW: No, absolutely not. And let\nme --\nQUESTION: But that's what I was looking\nfor.\nQUESTION: Do you want to reserve the rest\nof your time, Mr. Sekulow?\nMR. SEKULOW: I don't have -- I only have\n20 minutes, so I cannot reserve any more time.\nThat's okay. But I would normally be happy to.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: If -- if you can give me an\nexample of a case where the state can say we know we\ncan give this funding to religious schools if we want\nto, but we don't want to? Can you give any example\nwhere that would be legitimate on your view of free\nexercise?\nMR. SEKULOW: Sure. There's -- I don't\nthink there is any affirmative obligation, Justice\nGinsburg, for the state, even if the Establishment\nClause -- I'll give an example. The Center Moriches\nSchool District in Lamb's Chapel, while this Court\nheld that the Establishment Clause did not --\nrequired them that they open their facilities to\ncomply with the First Amendment viewpoint neutrality\nissues, they're not -- they were not required to open\ntheir facilities up. The State of Washington could\ndevelop programs for specific majors.\nQUESTION: No, but if they opened it up at\nall, there was no play in the joints between the\nreligion clauses that said you can't open it up to\nthis particular religious presentation. Isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. SEKULOW: No, I think that --\nQUESTION: So I think -- let me just --\nMR. SEKULOW: Please.\nQUESTION: -- say what I think your\nposition is and then you -- I think your position is\nthat, although certain religious funding may not\nviolate the Establishment Clause, it does not follow\nthat the state must fund it. But if the state has a\ngeneral program for funding instruction, and this is\nreligious instruction, it's got to fund religious\ninstruction and there's no middle ground, there's no\nplay in the joints there. Is that correct?\nMR. SEKULOW: Under the latter\nhypothetical, that -- that would be our position,\nthat once you have gone into the private schools and\nthe school meets the neutral secular criteria, our\nview would be at that point the state should be equal\nand not target out religion for an exclusion, which\nis precisely the viewpoint neutrality issue that we\nthink should apply and, of course, within the free\nexercise context, the minimum requirement of\nneutrality is law not discriminate on its face. This\none does. If there are no further questions, thank\nyou, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sekulow.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Promise Scholarship program practices\nthe plainest form of religious discrimination. It\ndisqualifies the one course of study that is taught\nfrom a religious perspective. The clear and\nunmistakable message is that religion and preparation\nfor a career in the ministry is disfavored and\ndiscouraged.\nQUESTION: Well, but of course, there's\nbeen a couple of centuries of practice in this\ncountry of not funding religious instruction by tax\nmoney. I mean, that's -- that's as old as the\ncountry itself, isn't it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, yes, it is. But there\nis the other tradition that is as old as the country\nitself, is the free exercise component of the\nreligion clauses, which this Court has said\nrepeatedly mandates neutrality.\nQUESTION: But how is his free exercise\nchilled at all? Can't he practice his religion just\nas he always would and become a minister?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's --\nQUESTION: He just has to pay for it.\nMR. OLSON: Justice -- well, Justice\nStevens, the individual that was disqualified in\nTennessee from being a member of a delegate to the\nConstitutional Convention because he was a minister\n--\nQUESTION: He was prohibited from doing\nsomething every other citizen can do.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the same -- the Court\nwould have come out the same way, I submit, if it\nsaid that ministers will not have their expenses\npaid, but everybody else will. The language of the\ndecision and the language of Sherbert v. Verner and\nFowler v. Rhode Island is that to the extent that a\nreligion --\nQUESTION: But you're still not addressing\nthe question of how his -- his freedom to practice\nthe religion he wants to practice is impaired at all.\nMR. OLSON: Well, he can practice it, but\nhe practices it at a price. Studying of theology as\nthe --\nQUESTION: He practices it without a\nsubsidy.\nMR. OLSON: He practices it without the\nsame subsidy that is made available to every other\ncitizen except someone who wants to study to be a\nminister. If it was discrimination against a\nminister in -- in the -- in the case involving\nTennessee, this is a discrimination against a person\nwho aspires to be a minister. He is given less of an\nadvantage than all --\nQUESTION: If it -- if it -- if it isn't\ncoercion of -- of his religion, I suppose it would be\nokay to limit this -- this exclusion to Jewish\ntheology or to Catholic theology, because the\nresponse would be it doesn't -- it doesn't coerce his\nreligion at all.\nMR. OLSON: We submit that the teachings\nof the decision of this Court --\nQUESTION: But isn't the difference that\nthat would plainly violate the Establishment Clause,\nand here we have a Free Exercise Clause issue.\nMR. OLSON: What this Court has said,\nJustice Stevens, is that in -- in many respects the\nEstablishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause are\ncomponents of the same principle that is --\nQUESTION: So you take the position\nthere's no breathing space between the two?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there is -- there may be\nbreathing space, especially with respect to the\nEstablishment Clause area, where this Court will not\nfind entanglement or endorsement under certain\nprograms that may not be required, but what this\nCourt has said is that distinguishing -- that\ndiscriminating against Catholics and discriminating\nagainst people who are religious generally and even\npeople who are anti-religious generally violates the\ntwin components of equality and neutrality that are\n-- that are mandated by the religion clauses.\nQUESTION: What -- what is your response\nto the following concern that's been brought up a few\ntimes but I'd like you to address it directly. This\ncase is perhaps a small matter of a distinction that\ndoesn't make all that much sense, but makes some.\nBut the implications of this case are breathtaking,\nthat it would mean if your side wins, that every\nprogram, not just educational programs, but nursing\nprograms, hospital programs, social welfare programs,\ncontracting programs throughout the governments would\ngo over, you'd have to go over each of them and\nthere'd be a claim in each instance that they cannot\nbe purely secular, that they must fund all religions\nwho want to do the same thing, and that those\nreligions, by the way, though it may be an excellent\nprinciple, may get into fights with each other about\nbillions and billions of dollars, so -- which is\nsomething about which I have written about, which you\nknow. All right. So, I'd like you to address that.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Breyer. It is\nnot a major step at all in this Court's jurisprudence\nto say that those funding programs for medicine,\ndoctors, nurses, cannot distinguish and not\ndiscriminate against a person who decides to go to a\nCatholic nurse or to a Catholic doctor. If money is\nmade available for individuals in the Medicare\nprogram to exclude people that want to go to\nreligious hospitals for their heart surgery, that\nwould violate the Free Exercise Clause.\nQUESTION: So do you agree, do you take\nthe position that if we affirm the court of appeals\nand accept your position, that the Court is committed\non the school voucher issue if, say, a school voucher\nprogram excludes parochial schools?\nMR. OLSON: It would depend, I suppose, on\nhow the program was structured, what the inquiry\ninvolving a compelling government -- strict scrutiny\nwould entail. There may be a difference, for\nexample, with respect to funding that's associated\nwith institutions, as opposed to individual\nconscience. This is the plainest form of religious\ndiscrimination because the person who wants to\nbelieve in God or wants to have a position of\nreligious leadership is the one that's singled out\nfor discriminatory treatment.\nThe Court has said before that\ndistinction, religious tests for governmental\nbenefits violate the Free Exercise Clause. This is a\nreligious test. If the person wants to take a\nprogram in theology, he's disqualified.\nQUESTION: What are the practical\nimplications?\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nQUESTION: Just want a sentence on the\npractical implication. Is it as far-reaching as my\ntone of voice suggested?\nMR. OLSON: I would say that the -- it is\nnot as far-reaching as the -- the sense of doom that\nyour question suggested.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Maybe a good thing I'm not --\ndon't --\nMR. OLSON: The idea that this country\nwhen it -- when it provides tax exemptions or cash to\ncitizens to educate their children, cannot single out\nfor discriminatory treatment the Catholic or the\nreligious person is not a far-reaching -- well, it\nmay have been far-reaching at the time, and thank\nheavens that it is, that this principle as the -- I\nthink one of the questions, I think it was Justice\nO'Connor's question, asked with respect to the\nfunding cases and this Court dealt specifically with\nthat in the Maher v. Roe case when it said the\nfunding cases do not control the significantly\ndifferent context in which a funding decision\nimpinges upon the constitutionally-imposed government\nobligation of neutrality required by the religion\nclauses. So those funding cases are completely\ndistinguishable --\nQUESTION: General, may I ask you this\nquestion? I mean, the whole argument for neutrality\ncomes down to an argument, I think, about the\nfollowing.\nMR. OLSON: About --\nQUESTION: About the following\ndistinction. The other side says, Washington says,\nlook, there is a line to be drawn, not between\nfunding Catholics and Protestants or atheists or\nwhat-not. The line to be drawn is the line between\nfunding education about a religion, education that\nsays this is what Catholics believe, this is what\natheists believe, and on the other hand, education\nthat says, this belief is valid, and you ought to go\nout and persuade other people to hold this belief.\nThey say, that is the distinction we are trying to\ndraw. Why is that distinction invalid under a\nneutrality criteria?\nMR. OLSON: For the reason that the same\nargument was rejected in the Rosenberger case, that\nthe notion of --\nQUESTION: But Rosenberger was not said --\nthe opinion in Rosenberger said these people are not\nproselytizing. And -- and the distinction that they\nare drawing is a distinction between believing in\nproselytizing on the one hand, how to do it, why it's\nvalid, and instruction on what people believe as a\nfact on the other. And I -- Rosenberger is an\nauthority for -- for the rejection of that\ndistinction.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I respectfully submit\nthat it is, that the students in the Rosenberger that\nwere publishing those articles were publishing\narticles that advocated belief in God.\nQUESTION: Oh, look, you're writing my\ndissent. I -- I agree, but my -- my --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: That was --\nQUESTION: I -- I couldn't -- I couldn't\nget four colleagues to agree with me on that, and\nthey went off on -- on another -- another course.\nMR. OLSON: Yeah, but the Court went on to\nsay that this was a free exercise violation as well\nas a First Amendment violation.\nThe other point that I think is very, very\nimportant with respect to that, if the state starts\nto distinguishing between discussion of a subject and\nproselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to\nbe enormous. The program will have to be looked at\nto see how persuasive it is. We know today that --\nQUESTION: If that argument is good, why\ndo we even bother with the -- the criterion of direct\nfunding of religion?\nMR. OLSON: Well, because --\nQUESTION: Because we -- we could have\ndrawn the line there.\nMR. OLSON: No, because the line has been\ndrawn by individuals, individuals making genuinely\nfree, independent choices to make a dispensation.\nIt's like the Court's example in those cases of an\nindividual receiving a check and then deciding\nexactly how to spend it so there's a great difference\nbetween those kind of cases. This is no different\nthan the example that Justice Scalia raised as\nproviding fire protection or -- or providing tax\ndeductions. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMs. Pierce, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NARDA PIERCE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. PIERCE: I would like to return to\nthree points. One, on the statute that says no aid\nshall be awarded to a student pursuing a degree in\ntheology. A question was asked saying that for\nadministrative ease the state uses this legislative\napproach, their constitutional command. But it's not\njust administrative ease. I think it's a question of\nentanglement. Should the state be involved in a\nclass-by-class assessment of whether it -- it\nindividually, it should be categorized as religious\ninstruction or not.\nQUESTION: But we've held in Witters that\nthere is no problem with that -- with that kind --\nwith that kind of subsidy.\nMS. PIERCE: For purposes of the\nEstablishment Clause. And I just wanted to point out\nthat our state supreme court has questioned in a\ndissent in the Gallway v. Grimm case, some justices\nof our state supreme court have asked, is focusing on\nthe degree program sufficient for our state\nconstitution? But we believe there are good reasons\nfor it that's not yet been addressed by our court,\nand that's to avoid that kind of class-by-class\ndetermination, not necessary in Witters because there\nthe focus is, does the Establishment Clause -- is it\nviolated by government endorsement?\nBut Washington does take a different\napproach to both prongs, both twin prongs of\nreligious freedom, and this is my second point. For\npurposes of funding, it looks beyond government\nendorsement and looks to the freedom of conscience in\nreligious matters of a broader range of citizens,\nincluding citizens who may not want to have their\ncompelled tax payments used for religious\ninstruction.\nSo it's the same principle. It doesn't\nbecome hostility to religion just because it extends\nthat one principle beyond what the Establishment\nClause requires. On the other hand, the State of\nWashington also puts greater restrictions on\ngovernment where their regulations may impact\nsomeone's free exercise of their religion so that\nunless a state -- the state can show a substantial\nneed, certain regulatory laws cannot be applied in a\nfashion that burdened the free exercise.\nThe Munns v. Martin case is a classic\nexample that we have cited to the Court. It's a case\nwhere historic landmark laws could not prevent a\nchurch from building a pastoral center because the\nhistoric landmark laws were deemed not to be\nsubstantially needed by the state to protect the\npublic.\nSo we do think there is wide latitude, and\nmy final point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this Court\nhas accorded the states wide latitude in funding\ndecisions for the states to make their own policy\njudgments. Here, all the state has done has been to\ndecline to fund religious instruction wherever it\noccurs, including in a theology degree program. We\nhave not overstepped our bounds by imposing an\nunconstitutional condition on Mr. Davey as a\nrecipient. In the overall picture, we're not\nsuppressing --\nQUESTION: It -- it -- it will fund\nreligious instruction. So long as he doesn't major\nin theology, he can take the same courses and get --\nget instructed in religion, can't he?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Scalia, that --\nQUESTION: So what you say is just not\ntrue?\nMS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice -- well, that\ncan happen in a rare circumstance. We believe that\nthere's a good reason to use that --\nQUESTION: Everybody who takes a theology\ncourse has to major in theology? I don't think it's\nrare at all. Probably most of the students at\nNorthwest College take theology courses. It's --\nit's a religious institution, and that's perfectly\nokay, and the state is willing to fund that.\nMS. PIERCE: That's what the statute\npermits now. Some justices of our state supreme\ncourt have expressed the same question whether that\nis possible. Thank you, Mr. --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
