BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere are three points that I would like to\npress this morning regarding deficient plea advice.\nFirst, this Court has consistently limited the effective\nassistance right to ensuring the reliability of the\nproceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and\nsentenced. Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice\nstandard.\nSecond, when asserting an ineffective\nassistance claim, the defendant --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I -- can I stop you on\nthe first? You say mere outcome is not enough,\nreliability of the proceedings. How does that fit with\nKimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective\nassistance, does attach to suppression hearings,\nobviously where evidence would not make the proceedings\nmore reliable?\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Kagan, even in\nKimmelman, the Court remanded back to the lower courts\nto determine whether there was prejudice, and the\nobvious implication was that if there was no prejudice\non the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself,\nthere would be no Sixth Amendment violation.\nThe second point that I wanted to press this\nmorning was that when asserting an ineffective\nassistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a\nsubstantive or procedural right, and this Court has\nalready held that a defendant has no right to a plea\nbargain.\nThird, every possible remedy for deficient\nplea advice creates intractable problems\ndemonstrating the right --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, isn't there a\nright to make a critical decision on whether to accept\nor reject a plea bargain, once offered? There's no\nright to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a\nright to make that kind of critical decision?\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Sotomayor, the -- the\nnot guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's\nconstitutional rights. It's invoking the right to trial\nthat the Sixth Amendment contemplates. And so this\nsituation is really more like Fretwell. It's not a\ndecision that you have, for example, whether to have a\njury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this\nattorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in\neach of those cases you have an underlying substantive\nor procedural constitutional right; and you have no\nright to a plea. And so this fork in the road is really\nan illusory one, because you have no right to choose the\nother side of the fork.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose this were a death\n-- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure --\nfailure to communicate. And that leaves me just one\nother question based on your opening remarks. We can\nthink about adjudication as having a constitutional\nviolation, injury, and remedy. Are you saying that\nthere was a violation in the abstract here but no\ninjury, or was there a violation and an injury but just\nno remedy?\nMR. BURSCH: I'm saying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you could do all of\nthat, including the death penalty, I --\nMR. BURSCH: Yes, I'm saying that there's no\nviolation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment\nviolation, you have to demonstrate unreliability of the\nadjudicatory process. I'm also saying that there's no\nreasonable remedy, and I'll talk about that in a minute.\nWith respect to the death penalty in\nparticular, I would refer this Court right back to the\nFretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his\ncounsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection\nthat would have changed the sentence to avoid the death\npenalty in that case. Collins obviously was overruled\nbefore habeas process, and this Court held that the\ndefendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective\nassistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because\nhe had no constitutional right in it. And so, really\nthe remedy -- I'm sorry. The severity of the sentence\ndoesn't enter the analysis once you've established that\nthere has been no violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say no violation,\nyou don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance\nof counsel? I thought that was conceded, that there was\nineffective assistance.\nMR. BURSCH: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. We have conceded for purposes of argument\nthat there was ineffective assistance. But Strickland\nis a two-part test, and even after you get past the\ndeficiency prong, there's still the question of whether\nthis casts some doubt on the reliability of the\nproceedings.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I thought that the\nsecond part of the test asked about harm. And here the\nperson is sitting in prison for three times as long as\nhe would have been sitting in prison had he had\neffective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining\nstage. So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements\nof Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, that's actually the best\nargument that the Respondent has in this case. And the\nreason --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Sounds like a good argument.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BURSCH: Well, the reason why it's wrong\nis because this Court has been very careful to define\nwhat that harm is. Specifically, the word was \"outcome\"\nin Cronic and Strickland. If you --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And outcome -- there is a\ndifferent outcome here. He's sitting in prison for\nthree times as long. That's a different outcome.\nMR. BURSCH: Yes, but the Court went on to\ndefine \"outcome\" to mean reliability of the adjudicatory\nprocess. In fact, specifically, the language was\nwhether absent the deficiency, the defendant -- I'm\nsorry. Absent the deficiency, the factfinder would have\nhad a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. And what we\nhave here is a situation where everyone acknowledges --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, take the sentencing\ncases. The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt\nis over, and the question is, is this person sitting in\njail for 1 day longer because his counsel was\nineffective? And if he is, we would find prejudice\nthere. So, why isn't the same thing true here?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, I don't believe it's quite\nthat simple. If there was some legal error, you know,\nan error to which he had a constitutional right, then\ncertainly what you said is exactly true. But if you're\ntalking about more or less days because of, for example,\na judge thinking that the -- the difference between\ncrack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other\nthings that are really up to the discretion of the trial\ncourt judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are\nnot Sixth Amendment violations.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I don't\nunderstand that answer, because that answer seems to\nsuggest that the -- that the assistance being provided\nwas not ineffective. But here, as Justice Ginsburg\nnotes, you've conceded that the assistance is\nineffective. That assistance has led to a much, much,\nmuch longer sentence. You know, as opposed to some of\nthe sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough,\nthis is 10 years or something. And, you know, that\nshould be the end of the game, no?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, let's try another\nsentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was\ndeficient performance. Say that there's a local trial\ncourt judge and everyone knows that he has a certain\npredilection that if you like the local sports team,\nhe's going to give you a break. If the attorney comes\nin and he does not press the argument that this\nconvicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets\na higher sentence, that's still not a Sixth Amendment\nviolation.\nReally, once you shift to sentencing, the\nquestion is, were you legally entitled to the result?\nAnd simply because he failed to appeal to the right\ndiscretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't\nreally make a difference. Here we're talking,\nobviously, about the guilt phase, and it's much easier\nhere because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic\nand Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that\noutcome difference, the harm difference, has to be\nreliability of the process itself. It's a process --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge, though,\nthat it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're --\nwell, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged. Let me ask\nyou: Have you provided ineffective assistance of\ncounsel if you are a lousy bargainer? You're just no\ngood at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game\nof bargaining. And so, you do a bad job in bargaining\ndown the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job. Is\nthat ineffective assistance of counsel?\nMR. BURSCH: Under the Court's first prong of\nStrickland, you would have to look at whatever the\nstandards of professional practice were, and depending\nhow lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be\ndeficient. But the important thing is if it didn't have\nany effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then\nit would not be a Sixth Amendment violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't even agree\nwith the first part. I don't think our legal process\nis -- is a bargaining game. Shouldn't be.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, we could agree with that.\nBargaining is not what this is about, and that's why\nthis Court has held in Weatherford and other cases that\nthere is no right to the plea bargain itself. And\nthat's really the second --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can -- you can agree\nwith that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are\ndisposed of by way of bargaining?\nMR. BURSCH: Because in the 95 percent of\ncases that are disposed of that way, this Court has\nalready held in Padilla and Hill that there is a\nconstitutional right to have effective counsel when\nyou're accepting that plea. And the difference is when\nyou're accepting a plea, you're being convicted. That\nis the conviction. And this Court frequently\nestablishes different tests when you're waiving a right,\nfor example the right to go to trial, versus invoking a\nright, going to trial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can you talk about\nthe reliability of a process or its fairness when you\nhave an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the\nlaw? How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going\ninto a trial thinking his client can't be convicted\nbecause the shots fired hit below the waist?\nMR. BURSCH: Because --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how can that kind of\ntrial ever be fair?\nMR. BURSCH: Because there's no evidence\nhere, not even a contention, that his belief had any\nimpact whatsoever on the fairness of the trial\nproceeding. And this Court has drawn a bright-line rule\nat trial. You know, if you look at the preliminary\nhearing, if there's attorney error there, deficiency --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you skipped over\na step. I think we do assume that the deficient advice\nled to the -- the determination to plead not guilty.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. Again -- but that fork\nin the road is not one to which he has a substantive\nprocedural right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the\nquestion -- that's the question we're confronting. So,\nI think --\nMR. BURSCH: Well, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- your answer was a\nlittle too facile on that point.\nMR. BURSCH: I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We have to assume there's\nineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client\nthe nature of the charge for the -- so that the client\ncan make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not\nguilty.\nMR. BURSCH: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We have to assume that in\nthis case, correct?\nMR. BURSCH: Correct, we are assuming that.\nBut what I would submit respectfully is that the plea\nstage isn't any different than a preliminary hearing or\na line-up or a suppression hearing, where if there was\nsome deficient attorney conduct, this Court would still\nthen look to see whether it had an adverse impact on the\nadjudication of guilt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the defective\nadvice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he\nwould not have entered if he had been properly advised.\nCan he get relief?\nMR. BURSCH: Absolutely. Under Hill and\nPadilla, this Court has said when you give up your right\nto trial, that's a very different situation and that\nthere is a remedy for that. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, explain why defective\nadvice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective\nadvice causing defendant to turn down a plea --\nMR. BURSCH: It's just --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- does not?\nMR. BURSCH: It's just like the difference\nbetween deciding to proceed with counsel, in which case\nthere's -- there's no barrier to entry, or deciding to\nproceed without counsel, giving up the constitutional\nright.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, the difference -- that's\nnot the difference at all. It seems to me the\ndifference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself\nof the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury\nbefore nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. When you plead guilty, you give up\nthat.\nWhen you don't plead guilty, you get what is\nthe best thing in our legal system. You can't do any\nbetter than that.\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Scalia, you said it much\nmore artfully, but that's exactly the point I was trying\nto make with Justice Ginsburg, that when you invoke your\nconstitutional right, your right to have an attorney, to\ngo to a trial, to have a jury, we don't set up barriers\nto entry. It's only when you give up those rights.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I take it, then, Mr. Bursch,\nyou would have the same answer if the State had never\nprovided counsel at all. So long as -- if the plea\nnegotiations were all done between the prosecutor and\nthe individual defendant, and the -- and the State\nrefused to provide the individual defendant with\ncounsel, but so long as the person in the end decided,\noh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's\nall fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. BURSCH: That would be our position,\nbecause that's consistent with this Court's holding in\nColeman and Wade and Kimmelman, that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that would also be your\nposition in a capital case?\nMR. BURSCH: Yes. Under Fretwell, this Court\nheld definitively that so long as the reliability of the\nadjudicatory process and sentence were intact, that the\ndeficient advice didn't affect it, that the severity of\nthe punishment was not legally relevant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, your position is you're\nentitled to effective assistance of counsel before you\nplead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective\nassistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?\nMR. BURSCH: I would say it slightly\ndifferent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. BURSCH: -- that you are entitled to\neffective counsel at every critical stage; however, it\nis not a Sixth Amendment violation unless it casts doubt\non the reliability of the adjudication of guilt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to my\nquestion: Is it a violation in the abstract then, of\ndamnum absque injuria?\nMR. BURSCH: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Damage without injury.\nMR. BURSCH: No, because under the Strickland\nand Cronic cases, there is no damage, there's no Sixth\nAmendment violation, unless you can prove the prejudice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, all of this is\ntheoretically interesting, and it may be that capital\ncases are sui generis here. But I thought the heart of\nyour argument was that there just is no way to\nunscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no --\nand that was your third point, and I understood it.\nMR. BURSCH: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There is no remedy that can\nput the parties back into the position where they would\nhave been had the error regarding the legal issue not\noccurred.\nMR. BURSCH: That's exactly right. And let's\ntalk about the two remedies that are most frequently\nbandied about in the circuit courts. The first is to\norder a new trial. And to us, it makes no sense to\norder a second trial after you've already had a first\nerror-free trial.\nIn addition, you think about these habeas\ncases; if you're issuing a habeas writ and vacating a\nsentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here,\nessentially you're releasing the defendant, because\nwitnesses will die, they'll move away, memories will be\nsparse. And so, that's the natural effect of that.\nAnd in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even\nadvocate for a second trial; he asks for specific\nperformance. The problem with that is there you're\ninfringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is\nsacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be. And\ncircumstances have changed once a trial has taken place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, \"sacred\" is a\nlittle strong, don't you think? I mean, it is a -- to\nsome extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows\nalready he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he\nhas to go back. But why is it so terribly difficult to\ntell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer\nif he wants, but then go through the normal process,\nwhich is it has to be approved by a judge and all that\nstuff? I don't see what's terribly difficult about\nthat.\nMR. BURSCH: We contend it violates the\nseparation of powers. But you bring up an important\npoint because circumstances have changed in two\nrespects. The first is that you learn more information.\nSo, here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not\nonly did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it\nwhile she was screaming and running away from him.\nThat's a changed circumstance. He might not give the\nsame plea. Even more so in Frye, where they learned\nthat he was picked for another criminal violation after\nthe plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he\nwould have taken the plea back when he knew that.\nBut the bigger changed circumstance is the\ntrial itself, because the prosecutor has now gone\nthrough the risk of having an acquittal. He has also\nput, for example, the 8-year-old sexual abuse defendant\non the stand, something he tried to avoid with the plea\noffer. And it truly is an egg that cannot be\nunscrambled.\nAnd unless there are further questions, I\nwill reserve of the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner's convictions and sentence are\nreliable because the proceedings that produced them were\nreliable. And to collaterally attack his convictions or\nhis sentence based on allegedly ineffective assistance\nof counsel, he has to show that the ineffective\nassistance of counsel prejudiced him. As this Court's\nStrickland cases have used that term, that means he has\nto show that a reviewing court should lack confidence in\nthe proceeding that produced the convictions or the\nsentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you -- first, there's\nnothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there? I\nmean, the text of the Sixth Amendment talks about\ncriminal prosecutions requiring the assistance of\ncounsel for defense, period.\nMR. JAY: The Sixth Amendment requires the\nassistance of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, there's nothing\nin the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications. I\nhaven't seen anything in any case which was other than\ncase specific. That is, this issue hasn't been decided\nbefore, not to my knowledge. The language can be taken\nout of those cases, as you've very properly done. And\nso, there's nothing that I could find in the cases.\nNothing in the Sixth Amendment itself. In 95 percent of\nthe cases, they do plead guilty. And what's the problem\nabout ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the\noffer he gave before?\nWell, I mean, I don't really see if there --\nand prejudice? What if a person's been executed? If he\nhad gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he\nwould have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay?\nThat's my imaginary case. I can think of one where\nthere's prejudice. He's dead. All right? So, what's\nthe answer in my imaginary case, if it's not in the\namendment, not in -- not a holding, et cetera?\nMR. JAY: Well, I think that -- let me\naddress that capital hypothetical that has come up\nseveral times. And I think that it's instructive,\nJustice Breyer, to look at this Court's Strickland cases\nand look at what remedy they order when there has been\nineffective assistance that shakes the reviewing court's\nconfidence in the proceeding that produced it. They\norder a new proceeding. They don't order a specific\nsentence. That's why the outcome has never been the --\nthe yardstick by which ineffective assistance of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to -- I want to\nstop you there because I don't understand it. The\nsuggestion is -- I'm not taking this case; I'm making up\na hypothetical since we're discussing it really based on\nthe next case. The defendant never heard the offer,\nnever heard it. It is crystal clear that if he'd heard\nit, he would have accepted it. Okay? I'm trying to\nseparate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me\nas difficult because of the facts, from the principle.\nAnd what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't\naccept the principle, and then we can worry about what's\na clear case.\nMR. JAY: But I think the principle,\nJustice Breyer, is that you look at what the -- you look\nat what it is the Court's being asked to set aside.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Death. Let's say death.\nMR. JAY: Right. So, in this case, you look\nat the death sentence. How was that death sentence\nproduced? If the defendant can show, for example, that\nhe got bad advice about the plea --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He shows that never did he\never become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and\nmoved on vacation and never told him about the plea\noffer. That's my hypothetical.\nMR. JAY: I think that's actually an easier\nhypothetical than the bad advice because you could show\nthat if the lawyer then gets -- stands up and does a\nbang-up job at trial, right -- the defendant is\nconvicted of capital murder. The defendant can't show\nany prejudicial effect on the trial. That means that no\nother lawyer doing a better job could have gotten the --\ncould even show a reasonable probability that a\ndifferent verdict would ensue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, the Court has said --\nMR. JAY: That defendant has a reliable\ncapital murder conviction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Court has said that death\nis different. And did you think it is inconceivable\nthat there could be a different rule for capital cases,\nsuch as a rule requiring that, in a capital case, any\noffer of a noncapital sentence as part of a plea bargain\nactually be waived by the defendant in court so that\nthis doesn't come up? This is not a capital case.\nMR. JAY: This is not a capital case, and I\nthink that it certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you don't\nwant to do the capital case? I'm still trying to get to\nthe principle.\nMR. JAY: I'm happy to do the capital case,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll change my hypothetical\nand say all that happened was that this perfect trial,\nbecause of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison\nfor 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which\nwould have given him 2 years. Now, he is in prison for\n48 years more, and I consider that that's at least\nharmful to him. So, where the amendment doesn't speak\nof it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal\nclear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it\nthat bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate\nassistance of counsel, remedial through a specific\ndecree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous\nunfairness and prejudice?\nMR. JAY: Two points, Justice Breyer. I'm --\nand I want to make sure that I get out my answer to your\ncapital hypothetical, because you don't look just at\nwhether the sentence that resulted was worse than the\nsentence that could have resulted. If that were the\ncase, Fretwell would have come out the other way.\nThat's death if -- with no objection made, life sentence\nif the objection had been made. So, it's not an\noutcome -- it's not a narrow comparison of outcomes.\nWhat you look at is how the sentence was produced. Is\nthis defendant entitled, had this -- to a lesser\nsentence?\nIs this -- had this defendant had a better\nlawyer at sentencing, is there even a reasonable\nprobability that the -- that that lawyer, through a\ndifferent strategy for identifying a legal error --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, you disagree with\nthe assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was\nunfair. This man deserved to get the sentence he got,\ndidn't he? He had a full and fair trial. A jury of 12\npeople, finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\ndetermined that he deserved that sentence. How could it\nbe unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved?\nMR. BURSCH: Yes, that's correct. In every\ncase --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The lists are legion where\npeople don't get the sentence that they deserve because,\nfor example, the lawyer was inadequate. I mean --\nMR. JAY: And in those cases, Justice Breyer,\nyou show that the lawyer had a bad strategy at\nsentencing. That may well have been the same bad\nstrategy that led the lawyer to recommend a not guilty\nplea. Let's go to trial on my crazy strategy. If he\ncan show that and he can show that a better lawyer with\na better strategy would produce a different result, then\nthe Sixth Amendment entitles that person to a new\nproceeding. The Sixth Amendment never entitles the\nperson to have a court order a particular sentence.\nAnd you can't use the prosecutor's offer\nmade at a different time as the benchmark and say, well,\nthe prosecutor was okay with it at this other time;\ntherefore, the prosecution must be forced to live with\nit now. And that's because a plea offer rests on a\nnumber of considerations: the need to obtain the\ndefendant's cooperation in other cases; the desire to\nspare the witnesses and the victim the burdens of trial;\nand, frankly, to avoid the risk of an acquittal. And\nthe prosecution in this case and in cases like this one,\nwhere there has been a reliable conviction and reliable\nsentencing, the prosecution has already incurred all of\nthose burdens. So, to look at the 51-month minimum\noffer that was made 8 years ago and have that be the\nbenchmark simply is not something that this Court has\never done in its Strickland cases. And I think that\nit's revealing about the Respondent's --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jay, you don't contest\nthat plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling\nsomebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you?\nMR. BURSCH: We don't -- we don't think --\nthat's not part of our argument here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, because we've said that\nmany times; isn't that right?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, the Court -- let me be\nprecise, Justice Kagan, because there are two things\nthat the Court can be talking about. There's the --\nthere's the -- the interaction between the State and the\ndefendant, and that's where the Court has customarily\nused language like \"critical stage,\" a confrontation\nbetween the defendant and the prosecution.\nThat's not what we have here. This is about\nprivate advice between the lawyer and the client, and\nwe're not contesting that he has a right to have that\nadvice be effective.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What we have recognized,\nright, is that plea bargaining is a critical phase\nbecause about 98 percent of the action of the criminal\njustice system occurs in plea bargaining. And to\ndeprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the\nprocess, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is\ninconsistent with the Sixth Amendment. That's what\nwe've said. Isn't that right?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, I don't think the Court\nhas faced up -- faced this particular situation, Justice\nKagan.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, it's not a critical\nphase. It's only a critical phase depending on the\noutcome of what happens at that phase?\nMR. JAY: We are -- we are assuming that --\nthat Mr. Cooper in this case had a right to receive\neffective advice about whether to enter this plea. But\nwe're -- our position is that he wasn't prejudiced\nbecause what --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Has -- have you ever seen a\ncritical phase before in our Sixth Amendment\njurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon\nwhat has -- what happens during that critical phase,\nwhere if one outcome results, there is no Sixth\nAmendment right, but if another outcome results there\nis?\nMR. JAY: Well, again, we don't think this is\nin any way crucial to deciding this case, but\nScott v. Illinois, Justice Kagan, is an example of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, couldn't --\ncouldn't it be said that what our cases hold is that\npleading guilty is a critical phase? Would that be\nenough to explain our cases?\nMR. JAY: It certainly is correct that\npleading -- that a guilty plea hearing, where the\ndefendant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's correct, but is\nit enough? Do you want us to write an opinion that plea\nnegotiations are not a critical stage of the criminal\nprocess unless at the end of the day a guilty plea\nresults?\nMR. JAY: That's not at all what we're\nasking, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. So, we --\nMR. JAY: What we are asking -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Kagan and I want to\nknow what your test is.\nMR. JAY: Our test to resolve this case is to\nlook at what it is that the habeas petitioner is\nchallenging. He's challenging conviction and his\nsentence. In the conviction, he was found guilty by a\njury. He now says, page 14a of the red brief, that he\nis guilty and he wishes he had pleaded guilty sooner.\nNo basis for challenging the conviction.\nMay I finish the thought on the sentence?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. JAY: And -- on this sentence, he was\nsentenced in accordance with law. He had effective\nrepresentation at sentencing, and he got the sentence\nthat corresponds to the counts of conviction. What he\nwants is to reinstate a deal that was in the\nprosecution's discretion to offer once upon a time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Newman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF VALERIE R. NEWMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. NEWMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIt is uncontroverted here that Anthony Cooper\nreceived incompetent advice from his counsel. It is\nuncontroverted here that, as a result of that\nincompetent advice, Mr. Cooper is serving between 100\nand 134 months of extra time of imprisonment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think that's not -- that\nhe got ineffective assistance, yes, that's not\ncontroverted. But that he would have gotten the 51\nmonths or 68 is certainly controverted because of two\ninterventions. The prosecutor can say: No deal; I'm\nwithdrawing it, even after an initial acceptance. And\nthe judge can say: I think 51 to 68 is entirely\nimproper for what this man did.\nMS. NEWMAN: Those are both true, Justice\nGinsburg -- Justice Ginsburg, but, however, the\nStrickland test requires a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent result. And on this record, we have no\nreasonable probability -- we have no reason to expect\nthat that's not exactly what would have happened.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The relief that you want is\nspecific performance of the plea bargain.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that correct?\nWhat if it had come to light or come to the\nprosecutor's attention during this intervening time that\nyour client had committed four or five other shootings?\nWould you still be entitled to specific performance?\nMS. NEWMAN: Yes. We evaluate the case, and\nthe Strickland analysis is an imperfect -- the\nStrickland remedy is an imperfect remedy. It has always\nbeen an imperfect remedy. It will always be an\nimperfect remedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the judge\nsupposed to do? Let's say the remedy is it goes back\nbefore the judge. We're trying to unwind the clock or\nwhatever the metaphor is. Does the judge have to\nprescind all knowledge of what he learned in the trial?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, this Court has stated\nnumerous times that it presumes a conscientious\ndecisionmaker, and a conscientious decisionmaker would\nput --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm asking what --\nI'm a conscientious decisionmaker, and I'm asking for\nyour advice on what I should do.\nMS. NEWMAN: That you would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know the details of this\ncrime, which were more horrific than I would have\nexpected, because I've heard them at the trial. Do I\njust somehow forget about that, prescind that?\nMS. NEWMAN: You would evaluate the case as\nyou would have evaluated it at the time of the\nproceedings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the answer is \"yes.\"\nI -- I ignore everything that I learned during the\ntrial.\nMS. NEWMAN: Yes, because the deficient --\nyou evaluate things at the point of the deficient\nperformance. And at the point of the deficient\nperformance, the judge had a certain amount of\ninformation before him, the prosecutor had a certain\namount of information before him, and the defense\nattorney had a certain amount of information before him.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, that's pretty\nincredible. It doesn't matter what the defendant has\ndone in the -- has been discovered to have done in the\ninterim? Committed 5 murders, 10 murders?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, in that case --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wipe it out of your mind; you\nget -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an\nearly point in -- in the investigation of the case?\nMS. NEWMAN: Yes, because what happens in\nineffective assistance of counsel claims is the State\nhas to bear the burden of the unconstitutionality. And\nso, that is a price that this Court has said the State\nwill bear when there is -- when there's a constitutional\nviolation, because there is no perfect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can the judge -- the\njudge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows\nwhat the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for\none of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the\nsentencing range is 81 to 135. So, without any --\nconsidering anything that happened at trial, the judge\nknows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man\nhad been charged with -- only with a felon in\npossession.\nMS. NEWMAN: Yes, that's accurate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it -- it seems most\nunlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea\nbargain for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.\nMS. NEWMAN: No, I would disagree with that.\nThis -- in this Court -- and I can represent to the\nCourt, in my practice before this Court, which I have\npracticed before this Court for many, many years, this\nplea bargain was an ordinary plea bargain. This was not\nanything extraordinary. It was very run of the mill.\nIt was -- it was a run-of-the-mill case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That may be, but is it not\ntrue that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon\nin possession?\nMS. NEWMAN: I did not -- typically, you only\nscore out the guidelines for the most serious offense.\nSo, the guidelines may have been high for the felon in\npossession offense, but, however, the judge -- in\nfashioning the remedy, you're not going to -- this Court\nwould not take discretion away from the judge. So, in\nfashioning the remedy, in adopting the remedy of the\nSixth Circuit if this Court were to do that, this case\nwould go back before this same judge if he's still on\nthe bench, and it would be -- would put people back --\nMr. Cooper would accept the plea, but the judge retains\nsentencing discretion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It wouldn't be a problem.\nThe problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take\nit, is what the order would say is that the prosecution\nhas to, for a reasonable time, extend the same offer.\nAnd then if it's accepted, you go to the judge. The\njudge doesn't have to accept the plea.\nMS. NEWMAN: Right. You can't find --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't make him do that.\nBut I have a bigger problem with this case, which is --\nwhich I may be the only one to have. But as I've looked\nat it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel\nwithin the AEDPA meaning. That is, you have two courts\nin the State which have said this is not ineffective.\nAnd as I look at it, it's somewhat ambiguous at best.\nAnd we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is. Well, I\nknow both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't\nmake us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in\nfact it's not.\nI mean -- so, what am I supposed to do about\nthat? I find this a tough case. I've read the record,\nand in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one\nelse's, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel\nsuch that the Sixth Circuit could set that aside -- a\ncontrary finding of the State court.\nWhat do I do?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If Justice Breyer permits\nme to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might\nagree with him or a way of viewing this, as I read the\nlower court's decisions, they said there wasn't\nineffectiveness because he was just trying to get a\nbetter deal.\nAnd I think that, translating what he said,\nthe very reasonable view by the court was the prosecutor\nmay think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really\nwanted to kill this woman, he would have hit her head or\nher chest, but he aimed low. So, he was really just\nangry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay,\nif she died, okay. But he really didn't have that\nheinous intent to execute, you know, a gunshot to the\nbrain. And so, he was hoping to negotiate something\nbetter. If that's -- Justice Breyer is shaking his\nhead. If that in fact -- if this is an AEDPA case, and\nwe have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't\nthat resolve this case?\nMS. NEWMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have to give\ndeference to their finding.\nMS. NEWMAN: You do have to give deference\nto their finding. There's no question under AEDPA\nthere's -- there's deference. And there's actually no\nquestion there's sort of a doubly deferential review,\ngiven the Strickland analysis. However, the State\ncourts did not decide this case on Sixth Amendment\ngrounds. So, there is nothing to give deference to.\nThe State courts decided this, and the trial court said\nMr. Cooper made his own choices. That's not an\nineffective assistance of counsel analysis.\nThe court of appeals in Michigan also did\nnot engage in a Sixth Amendment analysis. They adopted\nthe trial court and said that Mr. Cooper made his own\nchoices. So, there is -- and this claim was raised\nspecifically on Sixth Amendment grounds from the very\nbeginning of the appeal until it reached this Court.\nSo, there is no AEDPA deference to give to the State\ncourts' decisions. There is no question as well that it\nwas ineffective assistance, because the State court\nrecord does not bear out that Mr. McClain was trying to\nget a better deal. The State court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said -- you said\nearlier that the district court, the trial court judge,\nstill retains discretion as to whether or not to approve\nthe plea bargain, right, whether to accept it?\nMS. NEWMAN: The sentencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes -- well, which is\nit, the bargain or the sentence? It includes the\nsentence, correct?\nMS. NEWMAN: It's a sentence recommendation,\nand under Michigan law, the judge cannot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He has discretion --\nhe has discretion.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, is he allowed to\ntake into consideration all that's happened before, not\njust with respect to guilt or innocence or the result of\nthe trial, but in imposing the sentence or approving it?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, he can take into account\nanything that he could have taken into account in the\nfirst place. But in this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But nothing that he\nlearned at trial, I take it.\nMS. NEWMAN: I would argue no. I mean,\ncertainly this Court's set of parameters --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if he turns -- what if\nhe turns it down, Ms. Newman? He says, no, I can't\naccept this. What happens then? You have a new --\nMS. NEWMAN: I would say that's not an\noption -- oh, I'm sorry. For the judge --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, the judge. It goes\nback to the judge. We agree with you, and we send it\nback to the judge. We reinstate the offer, okay? He\naccepts the offer. It goes to the judge, and the judge\nsays: No, this is outrageous. I'm not going to approve\nthis plea bargain.\nWhat happens then?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, in that case, the case\nwould proceed under Michigan law. In that case, the\njudge would say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We would have a new trial;\nis that it?\nMS. NEWMAN: No. I don't -- I think it would\nbe perfectly acceptable to say a new trial is not -- not\nan appropriate remedy in this case, because he had a\ntrial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, if the judge\nturns it down, then the prior trial is valid; is that\nright?\nMS. NEWMAN: It would depend on the reasons\nwhy the judge would turn it down.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He turned it down because --\nMS. NEWMAN: It would have to be a legitimate\nreason under a State law; otherwise, there would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA. Yes. Yes, then the prior\ntrial is okay?\nMS. NEWMAN: It's not that it's okay, but I\nthink under imperfect circumstances, it's the result\nthat we're seeking.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why? I mean,\nwhy wouldn't the remedy be, as -- judging what you said\nbefore, is an order saying to the prosecution\nre-institute the plea bargain and give him whatever, a\nweek or whatever it is? Now, we imagine the defendant\nsays I accept. So, then they go to the judge, just as\nthey would have before.\nMS. NEWMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the judge has the\nfreedom to accept that or to reject it.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If he rejects it, there is\nno plea agreement. Now the defendant must plead. He\ncan plead guilty or not guilty. And whatever flows from\nthat, flows from it.\nMS. NEWMAN: That's a -- also a perfectly\nacceptable remedy. I think the purpose -- the reason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Both can't be\nperfect. Either he has another trial, although he's\njust been found guilty by a jury of 12 with an entirely\nfair proceeding, or else he doesn't have a new trial.\nWhich is it?\nJUSTICE BREYER: He does. He does. His\nsuggestion is perfect, but mine is more perfect.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. NEWMAN: Okay. The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You could do it. You don't\nhave to -- you would -- he's right, you would have to,\nunder my suggestion, have a new trial, even though there\nwas a trial that took place 2 years ago or whatever it\nis, correct?\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't the end of\nthe argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you're the\ndefense counsel, the best thing for you to do is not\ncommunicate any plea offer you get, and then if your\nclient is found guilty, then you can go back and say,\noh, by the way, I didn't tell you about this, and he\ngets a whole new trial.\nMS. NEWMAN: No. The -- the bar on habeas --\nwell, the bar on Strickland, even not on habeas, is a\nvery high bar, as this Court said in Padilla. And it's\nnot a bar that can often be met. And so, you have to\nshow under a Strickland analysis deficient performance\nand prejudice. So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't know if that's\ngoing to be so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A deficient\nperformance --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't know that that's\ngoing to be so hard to show. Do you think it's feasible\nto draw a distinction between this case, where there was\narguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which\nthe defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken\ncalculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at\ntrial? A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the\nguy's possible sentence at, let's say, 3 years. The\ndefense attorney says: We've got a great shot at an\nacquittal. Let's go to trial. I'm going to rip the\nprosecution's witnesses apart.\nThe trial turns out to be a disaster.\nConvicted on all counts, 25 years. Do you think that\nit's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt\nhere to be applied in that situation as well?\nMS. NEWMAN: I think it would be much more\ndifficult, because this Court on habeas review and State\ncourts on non-habeas review are very deferential to\nstrategic decisions. Almost anything that qualifies --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say that. But,\nas an administrative matter, I think we have to have\nsome concern that these plea negotiations and\ndiscussions are in myriad circumstances. The defense\nattorney is by the water cooler; the prosecutor walks by\nand says I'm thinking of offering you a good bargain in\nthe Jones case. He knows he's going to have that\nprosecutor in court the next day and really beat him.\nHe thinks he's going to soften him up. So, he doesn't\ncommunicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later\nsays withdrawn.\nWe're going to have inquiries post hoc on\nall of these negotiations and discussions. And it seems\nto me that, absent some other rule, which I don't think\nwe have the authority to impose, that all plea offers\nmust be in writing and be stated with specificity, that\nif -- what you're proposing is simply unworkable.\nMS. NEWMAN: I disagree, Your Honor. We've\nhad Hill -- we've had Strickland and Hill jurisprudence\nfor three decades. There's -- there was a floodgates\nargument when Hill was decided, that we're going to have\nall these people that the -- and we've had, since\nMcMann v. Richardson, this Court saying plea bargaining\nis a critical stage, and --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And most of the circuits\nfollow your rule; isn't that right?\nMS. NEWMAN: Right. We already have\nunanimity --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And the floodgates have not\nopened.\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Go ahead.\nMS. NEWMAN: Yes, we have unanimity in the\nFederal circuits, and we have -- almost every State that\nhas addressed this issue has addressed it in the same\nmanner. And so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the unanimity on\nthe remedy? Here, the court said that the writ shall be\ngranted conditioned on the State taking action to offer\nthe 51-to-85-month plea. So, that doesn't bind the\njudge, but it does bind the prosecutor.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it removes the\npossibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have\nwithdrawn that initial offer.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the prosecutor -- the\nremedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform? That\nthe prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, the remedies vary. When I\nsaid \"unanimity,\" I didn't mean every -- every court in\nevery circuit does -- handles this exactly the same way.\nUnanimity in the sense that every Federal circuit and\nalmost every State that has addressed this issue, and\nthey've addressed this issue for over 30 years, has\nfound that there is an -- there is a cognizable Sixth\nAmendment violation that can be remedied on appeal.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And perhaps the lack of\nunanimity on the remedy question is appropriate. I\nmean, people have been trying to suggest different\nremedies. But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy\nquestion is to recognize that these cases present very\ndifferent factual circumstances, that there are a lot of\nvariation in them, and to give a substantial amount of\ndiscretion to the lower courts to work out what the best\nremedy is, consistent with that factual variation.\nMS. NEWMAN: Absolutely. And it's the same\nthing the courts have been doing, again, since\nStrickland and Hill were decided.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Like what? What factual\nvariation do you think justifies a categorically\ndifferent remedy? I mean, it seems to me some of the\nremedies are good and some are bad.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What factual -- I mean, give\nme an example of the different remedies and how a\ncertain fact situation could make one okay and the other\nnot okay.\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, even in the two cases\nbefore the Court today -- I mean, in Mr. Frye's, case he\naccepted a plea, and the State court ordered a new trial\nas the remedy for the -- for the ineffective assistance\nof counsel violation. In my case and Mr. Cooper's\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And why was that\nokay there?\nMS. NEWMAN: -- rejected -- pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why was that okay there?\nWhat -- what factual circumstances made that okay there?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, that just -- I don't know\nthat the factual circumstances make it okay, but it was\nthe remedy that the State -- I'm not sure I understand\nyour question. It was a remedy that the State ordered,\nand, in this case, it's just the remedy that was ordered\nby the Federal court was the remedy --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have a situation where\nthe -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is\nturned down and the defendant goes to trial. Are there\nany facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy\nother than specific performance the correct remedy in\nthat situation?\nMS. NEWMAN: These cases are so\nfact-specific, Your Honor, I don't want to evade the\nquestion about a hypothetical, but there's -- every case\nis so fact-specific that I think there's -- the\npossibility exists that a -- that the remedy would --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You recommend -- you\nrecommend specific performance as the remedy for your\ncase, and I agree with you that is -- if there is to be\na remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any\nmodicum of sense. The remedy of giving a new trial when\nthe person has already had a fair trial makes zero\nsense.\nMS. NEWMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, what I'm looking for is\nany situation in which -- you said leave it to the\ndiscretion of the trial judge. But what is -- what\ndiscretion is there? What remedy in that situation\nother than specific performance would be an\nappropriate -- would remedy what you claim to have been\nthe violation?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, in Mr. Cooper's case, I\nthink the -- the remedy in the Sixth Circuit is the only\nappropriate remedy that -- that puts every -- that is\nnarrowly tailored to the Sixth Amendment violation, and\nthat's what this Court has said.\nI mean, this Court has given direction to\nthe courts, to the lower courts, that you just narrowly\ntailor the remedy to fit the situation, because there's\nso many factual discrepancies --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's wrong -- let me\ngo back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I'm trying\nout what Justice Scalia suggested. Maybe that does work\nbetter. What -- what you'd say is, first, throw the\ndefendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is\nthere ineffective assistance, but also it would have\nmade a difference; he would have accepted the plea\nbargain.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, now they have to hold\nthe plea bargain open. They then do it. They then go\nto the judge, like any plea bargain. Ninety percent of\nthe time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of\nit.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But should the judge decide\nthat this is a case where he would reject a plea bargain\nfor any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption\nwas wrong, and we reinstate the previous trial. Now,\nthe -- just say it's over? You were tried, you were\nconvicted, that's the end of it.\nNow, what's wrong with that as a remedy? I\nmean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the\ncriminal justice system in some way?\nThat's, I think, pretty much what\nJustice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying\nthat out, because the more I think about it, the more I\nthink maybe that's okay.\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, I -- I believe it is what\nhe suggested. And I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't -- don't blame it on\nme. I don't --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- it's your\nsuggestion that we set aside a perfectly fair\nconviction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is just a hypothetical.\nIf you're going to set it aside --\nMS. NEWMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think you should put it\nback in.\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, again, right. It's going\nto depend on what happens -- happens below, and that --\nwe don't -- I mean, the -- the concept here is one --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you are begging\nthe question.\nMS. NEWMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay? Because I think,\nyes, Justice Breyer's first statement, you have to prove\nthe guy was going to take the plea, because there's no\nsense in -- in giving him a remedy that he --\nMS. NEWMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would have never\nsought.\nMS. NEWMAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? But it goes\nback to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the\nChief Justice's question, on what basis can the judge\nreject the plea? You have said earlier that he has to\nput aside any information he learned during the trial.\nAnd that's really the nub of this case. What are the\ngrounds that you're proposing the judge can use to\nreject the plea?\nMS. NEWMAN: That -- any grounds that would\nhave existed in the original circumstances. So, if the\njudge -- in -- in Michigan, there's a variety of reasons\nwhy a judge can say I -- I'm not going to accept this\nsentencing recommendation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how are you ever\ngoing to know that the defendant would have accepted the\nplea agreement? Because by not accepting it, he's got a\nchance of going scot-free. He's going to have a fair\ntrial, that's the assumption; and he may be acquitted.\nSo, how is a judge supposed to say -- I\nmean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would\nhave taken that deal, because it's better. Well, how is\na judge supposed to go back and decide whether that's\ntrue or not?\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, always -- in large part,\nit's not going to depend on the defendant; it's going to\n-- in larger part it's going to defend on -- depend on\ndefense counsel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why?\nMS. NEWMAN: -- in making that determination,\nbecause Strickland always looks at strategy. I mean,\nthat -- that's the underlying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you can --\nMS. NEWMAN: -- value of Strickland.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- answer the Chief\nJustice's question. The Chief Justice said how are you\ngoing to know -- you have to show prejudice.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no prejudice\nunless he would have accepted the deal.\nMS. NEWMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How are you going to know\nthat he would have? Of course, he's always going to say\nhe that would have, but how is the trial judge going to\nmake a credibility determination on that -- on that\nissue? I guess it's just a credibility determination.\nI don't know how he's going to do it. I think you can\nanswer the Chief Justice's question yes or no.\nMS. NEWMAN: I don't think I can --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the judge --\nMS. NEWMAN: -- answer it yes or no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the judge --\nhow is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide,\nwhether the defendant would have accepted the deal or\nnot?\nMS. NEWMAN: The same way that the trial\ncourts decide any question of fact. In this case, we\nhad testimony from the trial attorney. The trial\nattorney told the judge, I told him not to accept the\nplea because he legally could not be convicted of the\ncharge. I mean, Mr. Cooper was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the defendant's\nchoice; it's not the lawyer's choice. It's the\ndefendant's choice.\nMS. NEWMAN: But he -- but he has a right to\nthe assistance -- to the effective assistance of counsel\nin making that critical choice, and he didn't have the\neffective assistance of counsel. He wrote -- Mr. Cooper\nwrote letters to the judge --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the\nineffectiveness question. I understand that to be taken\nout of the case by the concessions on the other side.\nI'm talking about the prejudice question.\nMS. NEWMAN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is a judge\nsupposed to know?\nMS. NEWMAN: The judge looks at the record\nbefore him. So, in this case, we had Mr. Cooper's\ntestimony --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: People have\ndifferent -- some people are willing to take the chance.\nOkay? Let's assume there's a 20 percent chance the\nperson will be found guilty.\nSome people will say, I'm willing to take\nthat chance because I just don't want the chance of\ngoing to jail; I'm willing to roll the dice. Other\npeople will say, no, that's too much.\nNow, whether you want to go to jail may cut\none way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to\ndecide? Ask him, are you -- do you take chances?\nMS. NEWMAN: No, by -- by looking at --\nMr. Chief Justice, by looking at the evidence in the\nrecord before him. In this case, Mr. Cooper wrote --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the judge should\ndecide whether he would take the deal.\nMS. NEWMAN: No --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Look at the evidence\nbefore him and say, boy, I'd take that deal.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. NEWMAN: No, no, no, no. Mr. -- Mr.\nCooper wrote two letters to the judge saying, I want to\naccept a plea. Mr. McClain, the trial attorney who\nprovided the incompetent advice, told the judge in a\npostconviction hearing that Mr. Cooper wanted to take a\nplea. I mean, there -- there is no -- it is beyond\nquestion in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the length and\nthe complexity of the trial has any bearing on this?\nThis was a relatively short and simple trial. But let's\nsay a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which\nthe trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to\ncost -- and it's going to cost a million dollars, and if\nthey try that case, there are going to be other cases\nthat they won't be able to try. The plea is rejected,\nthe case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy\nis to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was\npredicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden\nof having to try that case.\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, every plea bargain is\npredicated on relieving the prosecution of having the\nburden of -- of trying a case. I mean, the key here\nis -- let's get back to what Strickland stands for, and\nit's the unreliability or the unfairness of the\nproceedings. It's not just an unreliability\ndetermination.\nSo, in this case, Mr. Cooper had two\nchoices. He could take a certain plea with almost a\ncertain sentence or he could have really what was a\ncharade of a trial because his attorney told him you --\nyou can't be convicted of this offense; you will not be\nconvicted of this offense following a trial. You'll be\nconvicted of a lesser --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You conceded -- you\nconceded he had a fair trial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not in the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMS. NEWMAN: I didn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It can't be a charade and\nstill be fair.\nMS. NEWMAN: It's an unfairness of the entire\nproceedings that were presented. All right? So,\nthere's no separate habeas claim with respect to the\ntrial, but the -- but reality is when you look at the\ncriminal -- when you look at the Sixth Amendment, it\ntalks about the criminal proceedings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying it was unfair\nto have a fair trial?\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm saying it's unfair to go to\ntrial when your attorney tells you, you can't be\nconvicted.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying it's unfair\nto have a fair trial; isn't that correct?\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That has to be your\nposition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it is.\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm saying it's unfair to say\nthat the trial erases the unfairness when there was no\npossibility but for a conviction at the end of the road.\nSo, this was a certain guilty plea or this was a long\nguilty plea under the math of a trial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can never say\nthat there's no possibility of acquittal. Juries can\ndecide not to convict no matter what the evidence.\nMS. NEWMAN: There was no defense. I mean,\nthere was no possibility --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's up to the\njury. It's not up to us ex ante to decide this guy is\ndefinitely going to lose; so, let's not waste our time.\nJuries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not --\nit's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide\nfor whatever reason we are not going to convict this\nguy. Right?\nMS. NEWMAN: That's true, but in this case,\nMr. McClain told Mr. Cooper he would be convicted. I\nmean, he assured him of conviction. He said: You will\nbe convicted at the end of the trial; you're just going\nto be convicted of a lesser offense. The guidelines --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what was the\ndefense at trial?\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the defense at\ntrial?\nMS. NEWMAN: There wasn't -- there was no\ndefense presented. There was no real defense presented\nat trial because --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did he deny having\ncommitted the act of the shooting?\nMS. NEWMAN: Never.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At trial?\nMS. NEWMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it the case that, in\nmost of the cases in which motions of this kind are\nbrought to trial, judges -- if there is a defense of\nmistaken identity or of \"I didn't do it,\" that judges\noften find the defendant has not proven that they would\nhave taken the plea?\nMS. NEWMAN: Sorry. I didn't hear the rest.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In most cases in which a\ntrial is had, where the defendant is pleading\nmisidentification or \"I just didn't do this act,\" in\nthose cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or\ndon't find that the defendant has met their burden of\nproving that he or she would have taken the plea?\nMS. NEWMAN: I don't know that the cases bear\nout that if you have a valid defense, it would be\nharder. But I -- I would agree with that -- if that's a\nhypothetical, that if you have a valid defense, it would\nbe a lot harder to be in this position of showing that\nyou would have taken the plea.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought in this case,\nand you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client\ntold the attorney from the beginning: I did it; I want\nto plea.\nMS. NEWMAN: That's correct. There was never\n-- there was no question in this case at any step, at\nany stage of the proceedings, and there was no -- never,\nnever anything from the trial attorney other than\nincompetent advice. He never --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you -- I mean --\nMS. NEWMAN -- went to trial for an acquittal.\nHe went to trial because he believed legally his client\nwould be convicted of a lesser offense that would put\nhim in a better position than if he had accepted the\nplea. That was the only reason.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said there's -- I\nwant to make sure I understand your point. You said\nthere was no defense. Does that mean you didn't -- he\nhad a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put\non a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove\nthe case and they haven't done it.\nMS. NEWMAN: Well, he held the State to its\nburden, and that is a defense. I mean, I...\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did he -- did he --\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm not saying literally no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.\nMS. NEWMAN: I'm not saying literally no\ndefense, and I apologize if that's the way it came\nacross, but no cognizable defense. It wasn't mistaken\nidentification or we didn't intend to hit her. I mean,\nnever contested the basic facts of that case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's something the\njury could have accepted, right? Even if it's not\nlegally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the\nperson below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can\nsee a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend\nto kill her. He shot her, you know, below the waist.\nMaybe that is not such a bad strategy.\nMS. NEWMAN: Except the defense counsel on\nthis record specifically said that he -- that he was not\nrunning a strategy and hoping for that, that he told the\nclient legally that's the only thing that could happen\nto him, so he was in a better position by going to\ntrial.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bursch, 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you. I'd like to start at\nthe one point where I think all of us, including counsel\non both sides, agree, and that's that a second trial\nafter an error-free first trial doesn't make sense. And\nthat right there says a lot about Mr. Cooper's case,\nbecause a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial.\nAnd it's exceedingly strange that they're now saying\nthat I don't want a new trial. That demonstrates that\nwhat they are claiming is not a Strickland violation.\nI would like to address, Justice Breyer,\nyour suggestion that maybe you could have specific\nperformance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the\ntrial result could simply be re-imposed. And the\nquestion is: Well, what's the problem with that? And I\ncan tick off at least five.\nFirst, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it\ntakes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the\nplea, which he or she undeniably would have had the\nright.\nSecond, as Justice Alito said, it ignores\nthat there's information that could be learned in the\ninterim. Mr. Cooper shot three or four other people.\nThird, it ignores the fact that an\nerror-free trial has taken place. The prosecutor has\ntaken the risk of putting that 8-year-old sexual abuse\nvictim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away.\nFourth, as I already mentioned, we've got\nthe separation of powers issue and prosecutorial\ndiscretion.\nFifth, we're going to have intractable\nproblems. Say the offer was plead to A, we'll dismiss\nB. He rejects it based on deficient advice. You go to\ntrial. He is convicted on A and acquitted on B. And\nnow we're going to try to enforce the plea on A? I\nmean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem. So,\nthere's intractable problems.\nThe second point I want to make is about the\ndeath situation. And that's one we take very seriously.\nAnd, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty\nsituation, there could be a due process right or some\nother constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of\nrequiring something to be put on the record. But what's\nclear is that, under this Court's existing precedent,\nthat is not a Strickland violation because the amount of\nthe sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has\nnothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory\nproceeding and the sentence.\nFinally, the last point that I want to make\nis something else on which we can all agree. Mr. Cooper\nis guilty of shooting Kali Mundy. He also got exactly\nthe sentence that the people prescribed for the crime\nthat committed. There is very little unfair about\nholding him to that sentence. As Justice Kennedy said,\nit's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to\nhave a fair trial. And from our perspective, that is\nreally the beginning and the end of this inquiry.\nAnd unless you have any further questions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one, but it's more\nappropriate, I think, for the Government of the United\nStates. Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to\nbe a colloquy before a plea is entered. Do you think\nthe Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be\namended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a\nsentence inquire: Have there been plea offers; have\nthey all been communicated to the defendant?\nIs that good practice?\nMR. BURSCH: It could be good practice, but\nit wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even\nif they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the\nproblem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer\ngave to the client in private. And so, that doesn't\nsolve the core problem. The core problem is that\nthey're trying to claim that it was unfair to have a\nfair trial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if they had -- if\nplea offer had come out -- well, I don't know how it\nwould work. When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter\na not guilty plea.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. You know, the judge,\nunder your theory then, would have had to inquire:\nWell, what advice did your attorney give you with\nrespect to that? And then evaluate whether that advice\nwas good advice or bad advice.
