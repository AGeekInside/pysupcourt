FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA habeas petition challenging a new State\ncourt judgment for the first time cannot be a second or\nsuccessive petition. AEDPA, of course, is a highly\ncomplex statutory system that has many interdependent\nparts. The pivotal language of this case, section 2244,\nis reproduced at page 2 of the blue brief, of\nPetitioner's brief.\nWhat that section does is it restricts\nclaims that can be brought in, quote, \"a second or\nsuccessive habeas corpus application\" under section\n2254. So this text establishes a two-step framework.\nFirst, the court needs to decide whether it's dealing\nwith a second or successive petition. And second, if it\nis and only if it is, then the Court applies the\nmodified res judicata principles set forth in that\nsection.\nNow, this case involves only the first of\nthose two steps. And a petition, as here, that\nchallenges a new death sentence cannot be a second or\nsuccessive petition for the very simple reason that it\nchallenges a State court judgment that has no -- never\nbeen covered in a habeas petition before.\nJUSTICE ALITO: 2244 doesn't make any\nreference to judgment, 2244(b). And now you bring in\nthe concept of a judgment by looking at another\nprovision. But if \"second or successive application\"\nmeans a second or successive application with respect to\na particular judgment, then I don't see why the\nimportant and seemingly common sense point that you make\nin footnote 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that\nwhen a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief\nfrom his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas\npetition after his resentencing that challenged his\nconviction would be successive.\nYou suggest that there are two judgments;\nthere is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment\nof conviction. But for habeas purposes, the only thing\nthat is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the\nPetitioner is held in custody. And that is the\njudgment -- that is the sentence.\nSo I -- I -- if your argument is correct\nthat you look to whether there's a second or successive\napplication as to a judgment, then the point you make in\nfootnote 8 just cannot be true. So that if Petitioner\ngets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second\npetition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction.\nMR. FISHER: But, Justice Alito, let me make\nclear how we get to incorporating judgment and then\nanswer your question. The way that you incorporate the\nword \"judgment\" is because, again, the language I just\nquoted says \"an application under section 2244.\" And\nsection 2244 defines -- and this is at the bottom of the\npage, of page 2 -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I understand that.\nMR. FISHER: -- defines it as \"seeking\nrelief from a State court judgment.\"\nNow, you are right that -- that -- that if\nsomebody receives relief only as to their sentence and\ngets a new death sentence, as in this case, that the\njudgment he is challenging is new only as to the\nsentence.\nNow, there -- the word \"judgment\" appears in\nother places in the U.S. Code. There is two other\nplaces I am aware of where this Court had to construe\nthe word \"judgment.\" One of them is when this -- is\nwith respect to this Court's jurisdiction over final\nState court judgments. And in that realm -- this is in\nBrady v. Maryland in footnote 1 it's laid out. In that\nrealm, this Court treats the judgment as having two\nparts that can be final -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if a -- if someone has\na -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in\ncustody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas\npetition, isn't that right?\nMR. FISHER: That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So it -- it is the judgment\npursuant to which the person then is held in custody to\nwhich the habeas petition goes.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. And in Burton\nthis Court made it very clear that the judgment that\nhe's being held in custody as to is the new judgment\nthat he is challenging.\nNow, what I'm saying is in the Brady context\nthis Court has treated judgment as having two parts that\ncan be final as to one and not as to the other. In\nother contexts in Burton, for purposes of seeking an\nappeal or seeking habeas relief, it is treated as\ninseparable.\nAnd the common thread between those two\ncircumstances has been what minimizes Federal intrusion\non State affairs? And so in this context that's a very\neasy answer, because what this Court always assumed, and\ncorrectly so, I believe, is that if the only thing that\nis unconstitutional is somebody's sentence, that's the\nonly thing a Federal court has the power to invalidate.\nAnd that's the only thing -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the sentence\nis -- he is convicted, sentenced to 10 years, and raises\nan argument, and only an argument, that cuts off 2 years\nof his sentence. He says under the statute the maximum\nis 8 years, and the court says, the judgment is vacated\nto the extent it goes beyond 8 years.\nCan he then bring a new challenge to, say,\nthe whole sentence, or cut it off at 4 years, or does\nthat limit his challenge? In other words, I'm trying to\nget to the point that it's not just the conviction, but\nif it's a period of the sentence that is not subject to\nchallenge the first time?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I don't know,\nMr. Chief Justice, that that question could actually\narise in a section 2254 case, where the only thing a\nFederal court has power to do is to declare one way or\nthe other whether the sentence is constitutional or not\nand then leave it to the State to decide in further\nproceedings how to -- how to go forward.\nIn the Federal context in section 2255, the\nquestion you suggest might arise, and indeed it has in a\nfew places. And the question that the Federal courts\nhave asked themselves in the second habeas petition, the\nsecond in time habeas petition, is the -- is the\nPetitioner challenging something he lost on the first\ntime? And if the answer to that is yes, then it's a\nsuccessive petition.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to\nbelabor -\nMR. FISHER: If he's challenging -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't want to belabor this\npoint, but once you get beyond the formal argument that\nyou just look to whether it's a new judgment -- if you\n-- if you take a step beyond that, and if you -- if you\ndon't take a step beyond that, then footnote 8 is wrong.\nIf you take a step beyond that, then\nthere -- then there isn't a textual basis for drawing\nthis distinction between the sentence and the\nconviction. And what you need to ask is what is\nconsistent with the scheme of that; isn't that right?\nMR. FISHER: No, Justice Alito. I think\nthere are two textual bases. The first is the word\n\"judgment\" and, as I've described, sometimes this Court\ntreats the judgment as having two parts that can be\ndivided, and sometimes it doesn't. I think in this\ncontext it ought to treat them as able to be divided.\nThe other place you look is the words \"second\" -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Before you get\nbeyond that, what you are talking about here is the\njudgment under which he is being held in custody, right?\nMR. FISHER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- even if you\ndivide it, that judgment hasn't changed.\nMR. FISHER: Well, certainly it has -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is still -- even -- his\nsentence has been altered and it's sent back for\nresentencing, but he is still being held in custody\nunder the same judgment.\nMR. FISHER: He is being held in custody\nuntil he is executed, certainly, under his conviction.\nBut his death sentence -- and in habeas -- in habeas\nit's always been understood you can challenge not just\nthe fact of your custody, but the terms under which your\ncustody -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. But -\nMR. FISHER: So I think the death sentence\nhere is most easily thought of as the terms of the\ncustody, which is a separate thing that he challenged\nand won on the first time and is challenging again now.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I'm not sure.\nAnd getting back to Justice Alito's point, if -- if we\nsay that the conviction is separate from the sentence,\nhe can't challenge the conviction without being -\nmeeting the successive bar, what about the finding of\ndeath eligibility? Why -- why can't that be separated\nfrom the sentence just like the earlier conviction?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that because -\nwhat we're we are really talking about here when we talk\nabout death eligibility is the need to find an\naggravating circumstance. And here that goes only to\nwhether -- his penalty, what his penalty can be. It's\nonly to whether he can receive the death sentence or\nnot. So it goes solely to punishment, not to crime.\nNow, Justice Alito, on -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That followed from the\nfirst conviction.\nMR. FISHER: The first conviction enabled\nhim -- if we put aside for the moment our substantive\nfight over whether or not the crime itself constitutes\nan aggravating circumstance, but the conviction itself\ncarries a life sentence unless an aggravating\ncircumstance is found.\nAnd so put -- put it this way,\nJustice Kennedy: After the Eleventh Circuit granted\nhabeas relief the first time, Mr. Magwood at that\nmoment, in 1986, was subject to a conviction that\ncarried a life sentence. And it was the State that\nelected to go forward at that point and to seek a new\ndeath sentence. And all our position is, is that when\nthat brandnew full-blown sentencing hearing was held -\nand the Alabama trial court at Pet App. 103a called this\na \"complete and new assessment of the evidence and the\nlaw\" -- when this new hearing was held it had to comport\nwith the Constitution.\nI don't think even the State disputes that\nall the -- all parts of the Constitution applied in that\ncontext.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher -\nMR. FISHER: And so -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you -- you say -- you\npresent this argument that it is a second petition and\nyou say that's the only issue before us and there is no\nother way that the new proceeding would be cut off under\nAEDPA.\nThere was in this case, in the first -- when\nthe -- the sentence was set -- set aside, an order by\nthe district judge; and it said: Magwood, I want you\nnow to bring out all conceivable -- all conceivable\nclaims on pain of forfeiture.\nWhy doesn't that alone -- this is an order\nby the court: I don't want you to engage in seriatim\nlitigation; I want you to bring forward all conceivable\nclaims. And that was an order and it was made on pain\nof forfeiture. Why isn't that dispositive of this case?\nMR. FISHER: Because that order was entered\nin one case, and now we have an entirely different case,\nJustice Ginsburg. That order was entered in the case\nunder which Mr. Magwood challenged his 1981 judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what he's\nbringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could\nhave brought up then.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it's not -- it was not\nclaim he could have brought, and this is an important\npoint, Justice Ginsburg. Under res judicata law, he is\nnot making, as the State would say, the same claim now\nas he could have made then. The fact that he is\nchallenging a different judgment by definition makes it\na new -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the issue is the\nsame. The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death\npenalty because at the time he committed this offense,\nthere had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at\nleast one aggravator.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. The legal -- the\nlegal issue that he is raising is one that he could have\nraised then.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why doesn't preclusion\nresult from the court's order that says: Bring up all\nconceivable claims?\nMR. FISHER: Because you can't waive\nsomething by failing to raise it in a different case.\nThis is an entirely different case, in the district\ncourt -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then you get to -\nyou get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact\nwhat we have here is we have piece of paper issued in\n1981, and on that piece of paper it says: You, Billy\nJoe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by\nelectrocution. Then we have another piece of paper\nwhich was issued in 1986, and that says: You are\nordered and adjudged guilty of the offense of aggravated\nmurder and sentenced to death by electrocution. So the\nwords are identical. And one was issued in '81 and one\nwas issued in '86.\nSo you are saying since '86 -- this piece of\npaper in '86 is a new judgment, you can start all over.\nSo then the question comes up, well, if you can start\nall over in respect to anything, why can't you start all\nover in respect to everything? But you recognize that\nthat would be a mess, because all the things that were\nnever challenged here, like those things related to\nguilt, they could all come up again, too, even though he\nhas never done it.\nSo what is -- what is -- what is your\nanswer? Clearly you are going to start saying some\nthings if it wasn't at issue you can bring up, and\nothers you can't; and once you are down that track, how\ndo we know whether these are on one side or the other?\nMR. FISHER: So let me answer that in\npractical terms and then get back to Justice Alito by\ngiving a -- giving statutory hook for it.\nIn practical terms, even though the new\njudgment, which is at Pet. App. 106a, reimposes the\nconviction, it's not anything new as to that conviction.\nIf it were a new judgment as to that conviction, the\nState of Alabama would have to have a whole new trial on\nguilt/innocence, and it didn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is something new in\nrespect to the sentence.\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is something new in\nrespect to the sentence.\nMR. FISHER: It is new because of the\nbrandnew sentence, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah! But it is not new in\nrespect to the words. They are identical.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that happened -\nMR. FISHER: -- they imposed -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is the sentence was\nreimposed. So why not those things?\nDoes your concession on the first part,\nwhich I agree is necessary, imply a concession on the\nsecond part, that it's not new in respect to what might\nhave been brought up before?\nMR. FISHER: No, it doesn't. Look at this\nCourt's decision in Lawlor. This is discussed in our\nopening brief, I believe around page 23, and it's a res\njudicata case. And what the Court held in that case is\nif somebody does something to somebody, the exact same\nthing multiple times, you can bring a new case when they\ndo it to you the second time or the third time, and you\ncan make arguments that were never made the first time.\nThere is no waiver, there is no forfeiture, and the\nreason you can do it is you are challenging a new\ninjury.\nSo Mr. Magwood under -- even under res\njudicata law, which this Court has said is stricter than\nhabeas law, even under res judicata law he would have\nthe right to bring this claim as to the sentence because\nit's challenging something new.\nNow let me get back to the statute, because\nthis is important. The other place that we get our -\nour answer is the word -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The reason\nLawlor doesn't work is what you have there is different\nacts. The later judgment is -- is not just a later\njudgment with respect to the same act. It's a later\njudgment with -- with respect to a different act. Here\nyou are saying you want to apply the same rule with\nrespect to a later judgment, redoing the judgment for\nthe same prior act. And I don't think that the same\nrule has to apply.\nMR. FISHER: With all due respect, I think\nLawlor does apply. One example in that case is an\nabatable nuisance. Imagine that smoke goes over and\npollutes somebody's property every -- every first day of\nJanuary every year. Somebody brings a lawsuit about\nthat saying it violates certain laws, and they lose. If\nthe next year smoke goes over the property again, you\ncan bring a lawsuit for the identical thing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not the identical thing.\nThe last one was for the smoke that went last year. The\nnext one is for the smoke that went this year.\nMR. FISHER: Fair enough. Well, same -\nsame here. The first case Mr. Magwood brought was about\nthe 1981 judgment sentencing him to death, and this case\nis about the 1986.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same act of his. I'm\ntalking about the act that is the basis of the lawsuit.\nMR. FISHER: But remember, the act -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the very same act.\nMR. FISHER: But all we are talking about\nhere is not the same act. The same act as to the\nconviction carries over, but this was, as the trial\ncourt put it, a complete and new assessment of the\nevidence. This second -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I -- I want you\nto get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want\nto ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get\nback to Justice Alito's question as well. Under Alabama\nprocedure, at the sentencing hearing both in the first\ntrial and the second, is there evidence about the\naggravating and mitigating, or do you just look at the\nevidence that was proven in the guilt phase?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the trial judge -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there new witnesses,\net cetera?\nMR. FISHER: As it turns out, the parties\ndid not put new witnesses on the stand. But the trial\njudge was explicit -- and this is in the -- in the order\nthat's in the back of the appendix -- it was explicit\nthat the parties had the right to do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then it's -\nMR. FISHER: They had every right -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not clear to me why\ndeath eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction.\nMR. FISHER: Because death eligibility\nhinges on the finding of an aggravating circumstance.\nAnd so that was vacated when the -- when the -- when the\nState elected to go forward and tried to reimpose a\ndeath sentence and the -- reimpose a new death sentence\nand the trial judge found new -- it turned out to be the\nsame aggravating circumstance, but it found an\naggravating circumstance all over again.\nImagine, Justice Kennedy, the State if it\nhad wanted to at the second death sentence hearing could\nhave submitted evidence to try to prove a new\naggravating circumstance. The defendants could have\nsubmitted evidence trying to prove new mitigating\ncircumstances.\nNow, Mr. -- Justice Alito, I think it's\nimportant to get back to your question for the second\nactual hook for my argument, and it's the words \"second\nor successive.\" It has to -- in some way to make any\nsense of the statute, you have to say it's second or\nsuccessive as to something.\nNow, if you look at McCleskey, which is this\nCourt's most thorough consideration of that concept, it\nsays again and again in that decision what makes it\nsecond or successive is that you are asking for the same\nthing you have been denied before. You are coming back,\nas -- as -- as it used to be the case, you are filing,\nin effect, an appeal, endless appeals from the denials\nthat you have been getting.\nWe are giving meaning to \"second or\nsuccessive\" by saying that it's second or successive if\nyou are asking for relief that has been denied before.\nIt is not second or successive if it's the first time\nyou are challenging something new that the State's\nimposed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher -- Mr. Fisher,\nto get -- I get your \"second, it's a new judgment.\" But\nthinking in terms of what AEDPA was attempting to do, we\nhave two claims, one after the other. The second claim\nis one that would take away the death penalty forever,\nthat would be it, because he said the only sentence I\ncan get is life without parole.\nHe brings instead, first, one that doesn't\nmake him -- that still leaves him exposed to the death\npenalty. So the court has been put upon twice. If he\nhad brought the first claim and he is right about that,\nhe's not death eligible. Instead, he brings a claim\nthat still leaves him death eligible, and the court has\nbeen burdened twice, when easily he could have brought,\nas the district judge instructed him to do, everything\nthe first time.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I'm going to\ntell you two things. First of all, with -- with respect\nto the two different claims, given the severity of\nMr. Magwood's mental illness, I think there was every\nreason to expect that prevailing on that claim in the\nEleventh Circuit would have put an end to the State's\ndecision to seek the death penalty in this case.\nAs it turns out, it didn't and the State\nwent forward.\nBut also understand that the State's\nargument here, to the extent you are ordering the claims\nin sort of a level of importance, would apply even if\nthe opposite were true, even if Mr. Magwood had brought\nthe -- had brought some other claim the first time and\nprevailed on it. Any claim, the State says, that you\ncould have raised the first time is forever barred. And\nthat gets to, well, I still don't think I have quite\nanswered the question on second or successive, so let me\ncontinue that.\nWe are giving meaning to that term \"second\nor successive.\" It's important to understand that,\nwhatever slight difficulty you have with the word\n\"judgment\" and making sense of the words \"second or\nsuccessive\" in our case are dwarfed by the interpretive\ndifficulties, in fact the impossibilities, with respect\nto the State's proposal.\nThe State's proposal -- and it's laid out at\npage 17 of its brief, at the top of the page, right\nafter the number 1 -- the State's proposed rule -- and I\nthink it's useful to put it next to the statute. The\nState's proposed rule is if a claim could have been or\nwas raised in a prior petition, it is barred by Section\n2244 (2) or (1).\nNow, the first thing you will notice is that\nthe words \"second or successive\" appear nowhere in the\nState's rule. The State gives no definition, no meaning\nwhatsoever, to those concepts. What the State is trying\nto do is -- is ask this Court to create a brandnew\nwaiver system, a brandnew waiver system for all second\nin time petitions.\nAnd we know -- we know from\nMartinez-Villareal and Slack and other cases that second\nin time petitions are not necessarily successive and\ncertainly they ought not to be thought of as successive\nwhen they challenge a different judgment or a different\nconviction or the like.\nBut what the State is asking for is a\nbrandnew waiver system that has never been imposed in\nany decision from this Court and there have been three\ndecisions from this Court where it would have come up.\nOne is Burton, another is Richmond, which is cited in\nour brief, and the third case is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how -- how does the\nState's definition at page 17 of the red brief not\ncomport with the whole idea of second or successive?\nMR. FISHER: Because the only way to get the\nidea of second or successive into the State's definition\nis where it says prior habeas petition. So, the only\nway that a State can even be pretending to give meaning\nto that would be a second in time petition.\nNow, we know that can't be enough because of\nSlack and Martinez-Villareal. But even more than that,\nwe know that can't be enough because it would -- it\nwould prohibit defendants from bringing second habeas\npetitions even as to things that are novel as to -- a\nsecond in time rule would apply section 2244's rules to\neven second in time petitions that are brandnew things\nthat arose at the retrial or resentencing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that's not -\nthat's not something that could have been or was raised.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy.\nSo the State creates additional statutory language that\ndoesn't exist. It could have been or a previously\navailable rule. Let me give you some -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's an issue\nthat we look at all the time under AEDPA. That's not a\nnew approach. AEDPA says, you know, if you show that a\nclaim relies on a new rule of constitutional law made\nretroactive, that was previously unavailable. That\nseems to me to be the same inquiry, as to whether or not\na claim could not have been raised in a prior habeas\npetition.\nMR. FISHER: I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice.\nYou do look at those questions once it has been\ndetermined that a petition is second or successive. You\nhave never looked at those questions in order to\ndetermine somehow whether it gets in the door.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an -- I thought\nyour point -- I thought your point was, oh, this is\ngoing to be hard to do, impossible, as you say.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I can tell you lots of\nreasons why that would be the case. So, let me give you\nsome examples.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. First -\nbefore you get off whether this is second or successive,\nalthough the -- the State didn't put it this way, I\nthink what the State is clearly saying is that if it is\nthe second petition that could have raised this issue,\nit is second or successive. What's wrong with that?\nMR. FISHER: The word -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't that fit -- fit\nthe statutory language?\nMR. FISHER: Because the word the statute\nused, Justice Scalia, is \"claim,\" not issue. And this\nis not the same claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't use -\nMR. FISHER: Lawlor tells you that, and res\njudicata.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't use\n\"judgment,\" either, and -- and -- and you are -- you are\ndragging in judgment as the -- as the -\nMR. FISHER: Well, it refers to section\n2254, and section 2254 uses the word \"judgment,\" so it's\nour belief it is by incorporation.\nBut to get back to your precise question,\nit's important because the statute does not use the\nwords \"issue\" or \"argument.\" It uses the word \"claim,\"\nwhich is a defined term in legal parlance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So if -- if this is\nthe -- if this is the second time that this claim could\nhave been presented, it's a second -- it's a second or\nsuccessive claim.\nMR. FISHER: But, Justice Scalia, this is\nnot the second time this claim could have been\npresented. In 1983 or '84 when he filed his first\nhabeas petition, he couldn't make this claim because\nthis judgment didn't even exist. There would be no way\nto challenge this judgment. And I'm not being overly\ntechnical here. I just urge you to look at res judicata\nlaw.\nNow let me give you some examples of the\ndifficulties the State system would raise. First of\nall, with -- with respect to intervening authority. The\nState itself concedes in its brief that it's not clear\nhow its system would apply in the case of somebody who\ngets habeas relief and then later wants to seek habeas\nrelief based on an intervening decision of this Court.\nUp until now that has been a perfectly easy\nsituation because the new judgment allows a new claim to\nbe brought, but under the State's rule it's unclear. To\nthe extent that the State says, well, what we would have\nto do is look and see -- look and see whether if there\nwas fair notice of that decision, the defendant would\nhave raised it. That gets into very difficult\nsituations about how new is the decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me -- it\nseems to me those are the exact same problems that would\narise, do arise, under AEDPA. You have got to show that\nit's a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive.\nMR. FISHER: But that's not the State's\nrule, Mr. Chief Justice. It's very easy to say whether\nthis Court has made a decision retroactive. It would\nbe. It hasn't happened, but I imagine it would be very\neasy.\nThe State's rule is any new decision from\nthis Court gives the defendant a new -- gives potential\nrise to a debate as to whether or not that claim was\npreviously available.\nLet me tick off a couple of other things\nbefore I sit down. What about a situation the first\ntime where a claim is Teague-barred or procedurally\nprecluded or maybe even the defendant doesn't raise it\nbecause under the facts that the first trial went\nforward, it would have been harmless error.\nAll of those situations would raise very\ndifficult questions as to whether that claim, as the\nState would put it, was previously available. Even,\nagain, go back to the idea of having a new trial based\non new -- based on new facts and new evidence. Trying\nto figure out whether it's the same claim, a different\nclaim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing\nargument. Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact\nsame script a second time, there is going to be a huge\nfight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a\ndifferent claim.\nAnd finally, the State's other -- the other\nprong of the State's test is about claims that were\nraised before are now barred. Now, the State\nimmediately recognizes that that's a huge problem\nbecause it would bar defendants from making -- from\nseeking habeas relief if the State made the same\nviolation the second time around. So it invents a\nbrand-new due process principle that has never been held\nto be -- to be in existence by this Court. And indeed,\nin the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas\nsituation, where the State court made the same error\ntwice, it went straight to the constitutional claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's the\nsecond -- I see your light's on. If it's the second\ntime around, then it's just barred by law of the case.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it -- well, it shouldn't\nbe barred. Because it's a new judgment, the defendant\nshould be able to get relief the second time around. It\nwould be a very strange construction of the habeas\nstatute, and it wouldn't be law of the case because it\nwould be a new case, again, Justice Kennedy.\nAnd finally, let me give you the situation\nof claims the defendant raises but then loses on but is\nunable to appeal. Imagine a case like this where the\ndefendant has many other claims that he loses on in the\ndistrict court or in the court of appeals. Now, the\nState has a pickle here.\nIt has to either say that those claims are\nforever barred from being raised again, even though the\ndefendant was deprived of a full right to appeal because\nhe won on something else and couldn't appeal the losses\non the other issues, or the State has to say that those\nwere -- that those were not previously available, those\nclaims were not previously available, in which all of\nits rhetoric about resurrecting past claims drops away.\nAgain, a very difficult question that this\nCourt's going to have to grapple with if it accepts the\nState's rule.\nI would like to reserve what time I have\nleft.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nMr. Maze.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MAZE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEven though they rose together, the State\nhas litigated Magwood's mitigating circumstances in\nFederal court from 1983 to 1986, and now we have been\nlitigating these aggravating circumstances from 1997\nthrough today. That's piecemeal litigation. That's\nprecisely the reason that AEDPA was passed under 2244(b)\nand that's precisely what the abuse of the writ doctrine\nwas designed to prevent.\nAnd it's based on the principle that this\nCourt unanimously affirmed again yesterday. You have\nequitable principles that say when you have two parties,\na party has a full and fair opportunity to praise a\nclaim or to litigate. But the other party also has a\nfinality interest. And once you take away your full and\nfair opportunity by not using it, the other party's\ninterest in finality outweighs. That's what Congress\nenvisioned in AEDPA. That's what this Court envisioned\nwith the abuse of the write doctrine. That's why we\ndon't allow someone who had a claim previously available\nthat didn't use it to bring it again.\nAnd if I may, I want to go straight to\nJustice Alito's question about conviction versus\nsentence, and then to Justice Kennedy's about whether or\nnot under Alabama law this is aggravated with something\nnew to the resentencing.\nAs far as judgment -- conviction versus\nsentence, I had two answers. Justice Breyer got to the\nfirst. On page 106, the new judgment, as Mr. Magwood\nwould say, says, \"I hereby judge you convicted of the\nunderlying offense in the actual guilt phase and the\nsentence.\" So it contains both, if you consider that a\nnew judgment.\nBut the second point is, if Magwood is\ncorrect that you can separate a judgment of sentence and\nconviction, then Burton is wrong. Burton has to be\nwrong. Because the argument in Burton was -- he cited\nIn Re Taylor, which was the exact same case we put in\nour brief. He said: My first petition attacked the\njudgment of conviction; my second petition attacked the\njudgment of resentence, and because those are two\nseparate judgments, this was my first chance to attack\nthe judgment of sentence.\nAnd this Court said: No, it's one judgment;\nit's conviction and sentence. And because your first\npetition attacked that judgment that contained both,\nyour second petition attacks the same judgment that\ncontained both.\nSo if Mr. Magwood is right that you can\nseparate the two, then Burton has to be wrong. Now -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I think what you would\nhave to do -- it's a dilemma here.\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you would have to say\nto follow his approach, is you would say: Judge, here\nis what you would do. They're filing it from the second\njudgment. Okay? So it is not second or successive.\nBut wait. If there is a first judgment that\nsays the same thing, then it is, in effect, the first\njudgment that counts.\nNow, what happens when there is a change?\nWell, to note the scope of the change, you would go to\nthe habeas court and you would say, to the extent that\nthat habeas court changed -- reversed -\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or left open or told the\nlower court: Do this over; to that extent, it is a new\njudgment. And that -- that would get them where they\nwant to go.\nMR. MAZE: And you just answered\nJustice Kennedy's question. The question in this case\nis: What changed? If you'll look at the district\ncourt's opinion, its order from the first case -- it's\npage 228 of the opinion -- it said: The Court finds\nthat this case must be remanded to the State court for\nresentencing on the existence of mitigating\ncircumstances, rather than two. Justice Kennedy's\nquestion was -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait\nright there. I would have read that to say that what he\nsaid was: Vacate the sentencing part.\nNow, you say: Well, vacate the sentencing\npart; fine. Now we look at the second judgment, and we\nsay: It's a new judgment. Oh, but it isn't.\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as that habeas\ndidn't tinker with it. But they did tinker with it,\nbecause they vacated the sentencing part.\nNow, why doesn't that work? And his\nargument is, that works much easier for the judges, much\neasier for everybody, than to try to figure out whether\na claim could have or couldn't have been raised, whether\na sentence was changed from six years to five years, or\nwho knows what we are going to get into; et cetera.\nMR. MAZE: Because it's one of two things.\nEither you vacated the entire judgment and the\nconviction and sentence are put back together -- they\nare -- it is a new judgment altogether. Or you look at\nspecifically what the constitutional infirmity was that\nthe Court identified in that case.\nThe answer to Justice Kennedy's question is:\nThere are four things under Alabama law at the time of\nthis case that were necessary to have a death sentence.\nThe first was an indictment with an aggravating\ncircumstance. The second was a conviction of a capital\noffense. The third was the State announcing an\naggravating circumstance. And the fourth was a penalty\nphase recommendation from the jury that was unanimous.\nWhen this case went back, all four of those\nthings were carried over from the first trial. We\ndidn't do any of those things again. They were all\ncarried over. They are relics from the original trial.\nThe only thing new that happened was we added the two\nmitigators to the weighing calculus and it was\nreweighed. And we know that is true from the district\ncourt's opinion in the second case.\nMr. Magwood claimed that he could bring a\nclaim against the fact that we didn't re-empanel the\npenalty phase jury, which, again, is a sentencing claim,\nand the district court said no, the State court didn't\nhave to re-empanel the jury to give another\nrecommendation, because that wasn't the problem in the\nfirst case. The only problem in the first case was not\nhaving the two additional mitigators. And under the\nsame rationale, the State's announcement of the\naggravator was also a relic from the first case. And in\nfact, we know that, because in the circuit court's\nopinion in the first case, it specifically told the\nState court: If you will weigh the same aggravating\ncircumstance against the four instead of two, we won't\nquestion your judgment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This argument -- I am\nmaking it up, but I mean, he doesn't have to apply these\narguments -- but it seems to me that the argument\nagainst this is: What you are proposing is too\ncomplicated. There are thousands of these in the courts\nof appeals. All you would like is you would like the\ncourt of appeals to look back and say: What part of the\noriginal sentence did the district court, habeas,\nvacate?\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not look into the reasons\nfor it, et cetera. Because once we start going into the\nreasons for it, the litigation is just going to\nmushroom.\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and, you know, you\nhave this new witness but not that new witness, et\ncetera. So his argument is one from simplicity. Start\nwith the judgment. Second, keep it the same insofar as\nthe district court didn't vacate it. And deal with it\nas a new judgment, which it is, insofar as they did.\nMR. MAZE: There is a simple answer to why\nthe Federal courts can deal with this, and we know they\ncan deal with it. And the answer is: When this happens\non direct appeal in a Federal prisoner's case -- for\nexample, if a Federal prisoner says you shouldn't have\nenhanced my sentence for this one reason, and he gets a\nremand where the sentence is vacated, he is resentenced\nand it comes back up -- the circuit courts are\nunanimous. They all say you can't challenge other\nenhancers from the original sentence because you could\nhave raised it the first time. I can give you case\nafter case after case where they have done that. A good\nexample: Judge Posner had the case U.S. v. Parker 101\nat 3rd 527, where he says the exact same thing and his\nanalysis is exactly what we are saying. A party cannot\nuse the accident of a remand to raise in a second appeal\nan issue that he just as well could have raised in the\nfirst appeal. And the principle is exactly the same,\nthat the Federal courts in State habeas will look to see\nis this was an issue you could have raised the first\ntime, and if it was, you are out.\nIt would make no sense under AEDPA for a\nFederal prisoner on direct appeal to give the U.S.\ngovernment a finality interest in enhancers that could\nhave been challenged the first time, but not to give the\nsame finality interest to States when they are coming\ninto Federal court under AEDPA for aggravators that have\nbeen challenged the first time. Again, the whole\npurpose of AEDPA was to give finality to the State. If\nFederal government is going to get a greater interest\nthan the States, then AEDPA is completely -- I mean,\nit's just completely wrong.\nNow, another problem with Magwood's argument\nis, he is going to kill an entire line of cases, the\nKyzer cases, where you can challenge good time credits,\nparole credits. If you remember, in Kyzer, you said if\nyou are challenging your good time, you can raise that\nin a 2254 petition. Now, under Magwood's rule, if you\nread it as a second or successive application against a\njudgment -- let's assume that you've lost in your first\nhabeas, so your first petition is now done and you have\nlost. Good time credits are taken away from you. Under\nthis Court's precedent, you raised that in a 2254\npetition, but that petition will be the second petition\nunder the same judgment. And he would be barred because\nthe good time credit claims would meet an exception.\nIt's not new facts or law that proves he's innocent, and\ntherefore it is barred.\nThe only way that the circuits have been\nable to deal with that situation is exactly the way the\nState's saying here and that Justice Scalia is saying.\nYou ask the question first: Is this a claim that has\nbeen available before? And if it's not a claim that was\navailable before, and because it's a good time claim\nthat wasn't, then you say this is not a second or\nsuccessive application, because it is the first\napplication in which he could have brought the claim.\nThat's directly -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Mr. Fisher uses the\nword \"claim\" as -- differently.\nMR. MAZE: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He makes a distinction\nbetween \"issue\" and \"claim.\" Yes, it's the same issue;\ncould have been -- the issue could have been raised\nearlier, but, he says, it's not the same claim. And the\nstatute uses the word \"claim.\"\nMR. MAZE: I have two answers to that, if I\ncan, Justice Ginsburg. The first is: This Court has\ndefined a claim in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which is a 2254\ncase, as the assertion of a ground that entitles the\nPetitioner to habeas relief.\nIf you'll look at the question presented,\nMagwood agrees that this -- this says at the end: \"The\nPetitioner could have challenged his previously imposed\nbut now vacated sentence on the same constitutional\ngrounds.\" If the claim is grounds that can give you\nrelief and he admits that it's the same grounds he could\nhave gotten relief on the first time, it is the same\nclaim.\nNow, to the extent he is telling you this is\na new injury, that -- the smoke example that Mr. Magwood\nis talking about, we disagree with that; to the extent\nthat he would be right, the difference is in this case,\nhe asked us to blow the smoke at him a second time.\nRemember what happened in the first proceeding. Magwood\ndidn't challenge the aggravating circumstance, and then\nwhen we got to the court of appeals, he asked\nspecifically the Eleventh Circuit to send this case back\nfor resentencing so that the four mitigators could be\nweighed against the original aggravator. He asked for\nthis to go back and to -- asked to have the aggravator\napplied to him again. So he invited the error. This is\nnot like a normal civil case where -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what would happen\nif it had been sent back on this ground, but there was\nanother ground that he had appealed on which the Court\nnever reached?\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Would he still be\nable to raise that one on habeas?\nMR. MAZE: Yes. And again, the reason is -\nit's just like you said in Espinoza yesterday -- you get\none full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim. If\nyou raise the claim in the first petition, it's not\nabusive, as this Court said it in McCleskey, because\nMcCleskey says it is only abusive if you could have but\ndidn't. And this Court's really already answered that\nquestion in Slack.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you are right, but\nMcCleskey was pre-AEDPA.\nMR. MAZE: It was.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the answer under\nAEDPA to Justice Scalia's problem?\nMR. MAZE: I think it's the same, and the\nreason I say that because in Slack, you had a first\npetition that raised an exhausted claim. It was\ndismissed. He raised what everybody acknowledged was a\nsecond in time petition, but you said because he didn't\nget an adjudication on the merits, we're going to let\nhim do it again. The same thing happened in\nMartinez-Villareal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we just found that to\nbe successive under the words of the statute?\nMR. MAZE: Right. But in Panetti -- if you\nremember, in Panetti, he raised a -- he did not raise a\nFord claim the first time around, and this Court said\nyes, if we looked at it only a second in time, this\nwould be barred, but we defined second or successive\napplication under the abuse of the writ doctrine. And\nbecause this was the first time this claim was right you\nallowed him to do it and called it a first application,\nand the reason was because he couldn't raise it the\nfirst time.\nNow, back to the point -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your answer to\nJustice Scalia's point: Suppose it was raised but the\nCourt didn't decide it.\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your test, I take it, is\nthat he must have one full and fair opportunity to\nlitigate the question; that means to raise it, to have\nit aired, and to have it decided.\nMR. MAZE: Absolutely. The point would be,\nit's not an abuse of the writ if you raise a claim the\nfirst time but don't have the chance to have it\nadjudicated. You abuse the writ, as this Court has\nalways said, by having a chance to raise the claim but\nthen not doing it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what they raised -\nyour view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments\nthere are.\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If this claim could have\nbeen raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it\nbeen, it's barred.\nMR. MAZE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if either it couldn't\nhave been raised, or if it could have been raised and\nwouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully\nadjudicated, not barred.\nMR. MAZE: Yes, that's it. And that's\ndirectly in line -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And applied to everything.\nCan we reconcile that with the language?\nDoes it work in terms of the language?\nMR. MAZE: What this Court has done since\nAEDPA came out on two different occasions, has said the\nsecond or successive petition is a term of art, which\nwould give substance in our previous habeas corpus\ncases, the abuse of the writ doctrine cases.\nThis Court has always said since AEDPA came\nout that we have to define the term by looking at what's\nan abuse of the writ. And that's what the circuit\ncourts have done. The circuit courts are applying the\nsame rule that we have given you, which is precisely\nwhat Justice Scalia said earlier.\nJUSTICE BREYER: One judgment. One\njudgment. Never come up on appeal. Yes, it did, the\nfirst one. And let's see. There were 15 issues that\nwere raised. They only answered -- you know, they\nanswered one. Now we go back and then five years later\nhe wants to bring up a different one. Fine. You can do\nit. Not second or successive.\nMR. MAZE: Can you repeat? I'm sorry. I\nlost you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It -- it's there in the\ncase.\nMR. MAZE: Okay. The claim is available.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's one judgment. He\nmakes five claims.\nMR. MAZE: Okay. Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The district court doesn't\ndecide, for some reason, I don't know, number 3 or 4.\nMaybe I -- maybe it's not realistic, what I say. Let me\nthink about it some more.\nMR. MAZE: Okay. While you are doing that,\nI want to make another point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, just to\nfollow up: It's very realistic. I think a reasonable\njudge might decide: Look, if I can dispose of this case\non ground one, you know, why should I go and decide all\nthese other issues, which may be difficult?\nMR. MAZE: Right. And it does happen.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. And so I\nassume your point is that he can raise -- he can raise\nagain issues that he raised before; it's no fault of his\nthat the Court didn't reach -\nMR. MAZE: Yes, that's right. Because he\ndidn't have the full and fair opportunity to have it\nadjudicated. Now, in this -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Full -- see, he filed his\npetition -- this would get rid of -- I think there\nare -- I am worried about that there are cases out there\nthat say the opposite. But we get rid of all those\ncases, if there are any, and you just say that he has\nnot had the full opportunity to have the litigation on a\nclaim that he did raise.\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or if he couldn't have\nraised it, it doesn't matter if there was one judgment\nforever. He can raise it again and again, as long as he\nonly does each one once, and they are not second or\nsuccessive even if they appear in petitions 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6, and 7.\nMR. MAZE: That seems to be what the Court\nsaid in Martinez-Villareal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he'd have to bring\nthem all in petition, too. You can't say, you know,\nthere are five that weren't reached and bring a separate\nhabeas reach for each one of the five. At first habeas,\nyou would have to bring all of them, right?\nMR. MAZE: Right. And in the forum -- and\nin the forum rule, number 9 in the instructions, in big,\nbold letters, informs the Petitioner: You have to raise\nevery claim, subject to the fact that you will lose it\nif you don't.\nNow, I want to bring up a point on why this\nmatters to the State. On page 48 of our red brief, we\nshowed you some statistics about the number of claims\nthe Petitioners bring, but what we didn't cite -- it's\non page 51 and 52 of the same study. The study shows\nthat after AEDPA, 13 percent of capital habeas petitions\nnationwide -- and if you take Texas out, it's actually\n18 percent -- are granted. 70 percent of capital habeas\npetitions that are granted are granted on penalty phase\nclaims alone. In Alabama, we looked, and we haven't\nfound a conviction-based grant in over a decade, but we\nhave had two penalty phases in the last two years.\nSo what Mr. Magwood is doing is asking you\nto adopt the rule that, 10 percent of the time, would\nput the State and district courts in the position of\nrelitigating an entire capital habeas case. And what we\nshowed you was capital habeas proceedings are the\nabsolute most time-consuming cases in the district\ncourts. And he's wanting you to throw away the abuse of\nthe writ doctrine and the successive petition doctrine\nin cases where there was a limited grant in the first\ncase. And it -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the whole\ncase. I mean, he concedes that the conviction can't be\nchallenged. It's just the sentencing aspect.\nMR. MAZE: Right. As the point we have been\nmaking with Justice Alito, I just don't see where he can\nmake that distinction between conviction and sentence.\nAnd if this Court just comes back and says: New\njudgment means it resurrects, I can assure you that the\nnext petitioner will come along and say: I am not\nmaking the same concession that Mr. Magwood did;\njudgment means conviction and sentence, see Burton. And\nhe's going to raise 50 repetitive claims from his\nconviction and from his original sentence. And then we\nhave the problem that the Federal district courts are\nalready dealing with, if the habeas petitions, as we\nshowed in the brief -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Wouldn't\ncollateral estoppel block the relitigation of all\nsentencing -- resentencing issues that were decided that\nwere identical?\nMR. MAZE: No, Justice Sotomayor, and the\nreason is collateral estoppel is a res judicata\nprinciple that doesn't apply to Federal habeas\nproceedings. That's the reason that the abuse of writ\ndoctrine and the successive petition doctrine were\ncreated. When you go all the way back to Salinger -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case do I\nread that supports that proposition?\nMR. MAZE: Salinger.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I had thought that\nlaw of the case issue preclusion would apply.\nMR. MAZE: No. The Court has always said\nthat res judicata in -- forms, and the case to lack back\nto is all the way back to Salinger. If you remember\nSalinger, he had two habeas petitions. The first one\nraised a claim on which lost. The second petition\nraised exactly the same claim, and he lost again.\nAnd the Federal Government -- the reason he\nlost is because they said it was barred by res judicata,\nin this case claim preclusion. It went up to this Court\nand this Court said res judicata doesn't apply in\nFederal habeas proceedings, so that court is wrong.\nBut we understand the problems the courts\nare going to have because there is no res judicata;\ntherefore we are creating this abuse of the writ\ndoctrine, this equitable doctrine, that will allow the\ncourts to deal with the law of collateral estoppel. The\nonly thing that Mr. Magwood has been able to cite -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess if res judicata\napplied, you wouldn't bring habeas in the first place on\nan issue that was wrongly decided, right? If it was\ndecided res judicata.\nMR. MAZE: Yes. Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so your -- your habeas\nclaim would be barred.\nMR. MAZE: Right. And -- and again, a\nfurther point would be that, you know, Mr. Magwood keeps\nsaying that just because he won, this was different.\nBut -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the old -- the\nformer rule of course, was that you could bring writ\nafter writ after writ.\nMR. MAZE: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was McCleskey\nthe first time that that -- that that was foreclosed?\nNo.\nMR. MAZE: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that just -- that\njust incorporated a whole body of law which was very\nmuch like issue preclusion, was it not?\nMR. MAZE: Yes. No. The courts always said\nit is a modified sort of res judicata, but they are\ndifferent in some respects. You can use it sort of as\nan analogy, but they are different. The Court has said\nres adjudicata doesn't apply; that's why we have to have\nthis similar doctrine because without it you could raise\nrepetitive claims. It was the whole reason that the\nrule came into existence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens if in the\nfirst trial, the lawyer thinks, you know, I have two\nclaims here; one is mediocre and one is great. And I'm\nnot going to win in the court of appeals unless I make\nthe great one; just forget about the mediocre. And he\nbrings it and he wins. Okay? Now he goes back. Now\ncan he make the mediocre one?\nMR. MAZE: No. If he didn't raise it the\nfirst time, he has lost his opportunity. That's Wong\nDoo. The very first case that this Court ever decided\nunder abuse of the writ principles, Wong Doo raised two\nclaims, but the second claim he decided wasn't good\nenough. He failed to put on evidence and abandoned it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he better put in\neverything.\nMR. MAZE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if he puts in\neverything and they don't reach the other ones, he's\nokay, because he can raise it again.\nMR. MAZE: Right. And we will let him do\nthat.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask, is this\nthe cases in which the claim is he's ineligible for the\ndeath penalty?\nMR. MAZE: The underlying claim itself.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is that -- is that a\nmeritorious claim?\nMR. MAZE: The first -- the first answer is,\nthe claim itself is that I have did I have fair notice\nin 1978 that I could get the death penalty? The claim\nitself, no, is not meritorious, but of course that's our\nopinion. The Eleventh Circuit hasn't decided that issue\nyet, nor has it decided what has always been our\nprinciple argument: this claim is also procedurally\ndefaulted because he didn't fairly present it to the\nState courts. The State courts never had an opportunity\nto decide this fair warning claim -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The merits of the claims\nhave never been decided?\nMR. MAZE: Not -- not by the State courts\nbecause it wasn't fairly presented to them. The only -\nonly court to have even talked about it was the district\ncourt.\nBut again, the Eleventh Circuit hasn't dealt\nwith it because second or successive is a jurisdictional\nquestion, and if the claim is second or successive, then\nit's barred and we simply haven't gotten to it.\nAgain, Your Honors, all we are asking you to\ndo is uphold the abuse of the write doctrine for the\nsame reason the Court adopted it in 1924 all the way\nthrough AEDPA, and that is we are going to force\npetitioners to raise every claim they could the first\ntime, so we prevent the State, the victim's family and\nthe Federal court from going through second or third\nrounds of Federal habeas litigation on grounds they\ncould have raised the first time.\nIf the Court has no further questions I will\ncede my time to the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Maze.\nMr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me make two\npoints, Your Honor.\nIf I leave you with nothing else, think\nabout the argument that you just heard that again and\nagain talks about abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ,\nabuse of the writ. Well, there is now a statute that\noccupies this field, it's section 2254. And abuse of\nthe writ principles apply only if a petition is second\nor successive. So if this Court does nothing else, it\nhas to define that term, and we are the only ones who\nhave given you a definition of second or successive.\nAnd Congress made that decision for a\nreason. It thought it was fair to impose strict burdens\noh relitigation to the extent that the defendant lost.\nBut when he wins, and gets a brand-new trial or a\nbrand-new sentencing hearing -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to\nJustice -- to the Chief Justice's example to you at the\nvery beginning of your argument?\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To the Chief Justice's\nargument.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is an order to\nresentence, to reduce a sentence from 10 to 8 years.\nThe prior sentence was vacated. There is a new\nproceeding, a new Booker type 35538 proceeding where the\njudge is thinking about everything, and he says I am\ngoing to reduce it from 10 to 8 years. I am leaving\neverything else the same, because there was no arguments\nabout it; there is no anything about it.\nDoes your rule then mean that that\npetitioner can come back and say, my fine was wrong, my\nsupervised release was wrong, other convictions, other\nsentences that were consecutive or concurrent are wrong?\nMR. FISHER: Probably not. But let me tell\nyou, Justice Sotomayor, that question can arise only in\na Federal situation. It cannot arise under section 2244\nwhich gets to the other important point I wanted to\nmake.\nThe State keeps talking about what the\ndistrict court said. Well, when the State -- when this\ncase went to the Eleventh Circuit the first time, the\nState made it very clear. It complained, it said the\ndistrict court can't remand this to the State courts, it\ncan't micromanage what a State court does.\nAll it can do -- and,\nJustice Scalia, this is, I think, most clearly put in\nyour Wilkinson concurrence is order the release or not.\nThe Federal court in this case ordered Magwood's release\nfrom the death penalty unless the defendant -- unless\nthe State wanted to elect to have a brandnew sentencing\nproceeding.\nNow, the State elected to do that,\nand had every right to do it. But Magwood also had\nevery right to insist on every constitutional protection\nin that circumstance.\nAnd if I might finish this\nsentence, Mr. Chief Justice, when he -- we agreed if\nthat Mr. Magwood had not properly preserved this\nargument the second time around, it would be\nprocedurally defaulted. And if the State wants to make\nthat argument on remand, it can. But understand that\nthe State's argument is asking you to say that a claim\nis barred from Federal habeas even if the defendant\ncompletely properly raises it the second time around and\nloses it and wants to then bring it to the Federal\ncourts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
