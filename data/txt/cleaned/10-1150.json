Prometheus Laboratories.\nMr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWe're here today to urge the Court to\nreinstate the district court's decision, which\nfaithfully applied this Court's precedents under section\n101 of the Patent Act. The problem with the Prometheus\npatent is its broad pre-emption of a physical\nphenomenon, which prevents others like Mayo Clinic from\noffering a better metabolite test with more accurate\nnumbers.\nAnd this is a huge practical problem for\npatients. These thiopurine drugs are strong medicine.\nToo much of this can be fatal; too little can leave a\nchronic lingering disease in the patient.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I didn't\nthink that this patent covered the actual machine. Mayo\nis free to develop a new machine.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it -- what it can't do\nis use any number from 400 up until infinity, and it\nbelieves that's the wrong number. And it can't have a\n-- a different standard for a legion of autoimmune\ndiseases, and there are dozens and dozens of them.\nThat's a broad field to pre-empt the natural phenomenon.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it -- it actually\nis much narrower than that. It's within a range, two\nranges actually. And so, it has already changed one\nrange, and that's not the subject of the district\ncourt's finding that the lower number it's proposing is\ninfringing.\nSo, it's not as broad as you are stating.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you -- you see, Your\nHonor, we believe the correct number is 450 to 700. And\nthat's necessary to cure various autoimmune diseases.\nAnd Prometheus took the position that its patent\npre-empts everything above 400, all the way up to\ninfinity, it said, for all autoimmune diseases, dozens\nand dozens of them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it took that\nposition, but the district court narrowed it to 15\npercent, to 15 --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you know, actually it\ndidn't, Your Honor. You'll see in that opinion, there\nare two rulings. One is the 15 percent ruling, which\nlowers the number; but it said 400 and above all the way\nto infinity. There's no upper limit on this.\nSo, as a practical matter, there's no room\nfor anybody else to offer a metabolite test. And what\nthis means for patients is one opinion in the United\nStates. If you have one of these life-threatening\ndiseases --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It can offer the test.\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- you get one opinion.\nPardon me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It can offer the test.\nIt just can't recommend the dosage to the doctor.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it can't have a test\nthat has a different therapeutic range, because that's a\npre-emption. They take the position --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tests do two things:\nThey measure something --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and therapeutic range\ndoes something else. The tests can happen. The doctor\ngets a number. What the doctor does with that number is\na different issue.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And -- and what -- what\nPrometheus submitted and the court agreed is if you are\nnotified, if you are aware of their range when you're\ndrawing blood, that's an infringement right then and\nthere, if -- if you're aware or warned by their number.\nSo, any doctor in the United States that\ndraws blood and is aware of this range of theirs is\npre-empting. And the practical result is we haven't\nbeen able to offer this competing test now for 7 years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When -- when the\nRespondent addresses this, will they take issue with the\nway you describe what has been pre-empted, or as you\nread their -- we'll ask them -- but as you read their\nbrief, is this crystal-clear?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you'll see,\nJustice Kennedy, in the district court, they argued for\nany number above 400. That's -- it's 400 and above, is\nwhat it says. And they said there's no upper limit on\nthat. The district court found that. That was their\nposition. It was accepted.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In thinking about what's\npre-empted, I looked at the Diehr case involving the\nrubber molding --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and the constant\nmonitoring. And if you could take an analogy from that,\nlet's -- let's suppose that there was a system of\nmeasurements that you take every half-hour which\nconstantly monitor how a drug is being retained in the\ntissues, and that there is a protocol for the admission\nof some two or three different drugs to get the balance\nright. In other words, it's much more complicated.\nIs there some point at which that is\npatentable, even though this pre-empts a -- a whole\nrange of different choices?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it may be patentable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's hard for you to\nanswer -- you know, there's a million hypotheticals.\nBut I'm just trying to --\nMR. SHAPIRO: The key is the specificity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- see what the process is\nhere.\nMR. SHAPIRO: If it leaves room for others\nto have their own tests with different numbers and\ndifferent procedures so that it isn't just one test for\nthe whole country, then yes, if it's specific enough.\nThe specificity is the key.\nWhat -- what the Court said in Bilski, of\ncourse, is that you can't pre-empt a whole field, a\nbroad field with -- with your -- your patent, which this\none does. And if you look at the diseases that are\ncovered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm not comfortable\nwith that. I mean, it depends on how -- how broad it\nis?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. If you -- if you\npre-empt all the numbers up to infinity and all\nautoimmune diseases, that's a vast field. It's much\nbigger than the field in Flook.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about up to 700? Is\nthat okay?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, no. I -- I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 550?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No. I -- I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 830?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, how are we supposed\nto apply that kind of a rule?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think doctors have to\nhave freedom to make their own judgments about these\nnatural phenomena.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Above -- above 830 or below\n830? Which?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- no. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just seems to me not\na -- not a patent rule that we could possibly apply.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it's the rule I believe\nadopted in Bilski and in Flook, that you can't wipe out\na whole field so no one else can have a competing test.\nThe result for the public is that these numbers would be\nfrozen for 20 years, and a very serious person couldn't\nget a second opinion from Mayo Clinic, which uses\ndifferent numbers. That's why we think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't any --\nany medical patent rely on natural processes? I mean,\neven if you invent a new drug, what that new drug does\nis -- is natural. It affects the -- the human\nphysiognomy --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in a certain natural\nway.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it therefore\nprecluded from patentability?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No, it's not. And, in fact,\nthis drug was patented.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's different here?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The difference is the\nspecificity. If you invent a drug which has a\nparticular chemical formula, others can invent other\ndrugs. There's room for competing drugs in the medical\nworld. And you'll -- many, many patented drugs --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought your answer to\nJustice Scalia would be -- and please correct me -- the\ndifference is, is that what the Respondent is claiming\nis a -- a patent on the measurement of the result.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, it is a patent on a\nmeasurement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're giving a\ndifferent answer.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's how I would\nhave answered the question. But that's obviously not --\nMR. SHAPIRO: No, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the right way to do it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think that's -- that's\none -- one part of it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's another one of\nyour arguments, but one of your arguments says you can't\npatent nature.\nMR. SHAPIRO: You can't patent nature.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that relates to the\nquestion that I asked.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And tell me why you can't\npatent nature, then?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Because -- because of the law\nof nature doctrine that has existed for 150 years in\nthis Court. Congress has never disagreed with that.\nPieces of nature can't be monopolized. Neither can\nformulas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, but your\nquestion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Nature always -- nature\nalways has a reaction to the drug.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Nature always has a\nreaction to the drug.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. So, all doctors --\nthat's part of the storehouse of information. All\ndoctors can look at that reaction. They can calibrate\nit the way they see fit. They have different opinions.\nAnd it's important for all of us that they have those\ndifferent opinions. We found that the numbers that they\nwere using were way off for skin disorders, dangerously\nhigh. 400 is the wrong number. The correct number is\n150 to 300.\nNow, it's very important for patients to\nbe -- with life-threatening conditions, to be able to\nget that information.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But then, how\ndo you -- that's -- I see that. I will spare you the\nreasons why I think the law of nature doctrine exists,\nbecause they are not relevant to my question.\nMy question is I think it's hornbook law\nthat the law of nature cannot be patented.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is also hornbook law\nthat the application of a law of nature can be patented.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, in this\ncase, what I think the claim is, is that we are applying\na law of nature. Now, we read the words of applying it:\nAdminister a drug, determine the level. And then it\nuses the word \"wherein,\" which I'll ask them what that\nmeans. But -- but -- so, they say those two words,\nadminister the drug, determine the level, are the\napplication of the law of nature that they found.\nNow, there's something odd about that in\nyour view --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- at least. And I want to\nknow what.\nMR. SHAPIRO: For us, the real oddity is\nthat this numerical calibration that they've given\nextends up to infinity, and it precludes every other\nblood test.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose it\ndidn't. Suppose I discover that if I take aspirin,\nsomeone takes aspirin, I discover they have to take\naspirin for a headache, and, you know, I see an amazing\nthing: If you look at a person's little finger, and you\nnotice the color, it shows the aspirin, you need a\nlittle more; unless it's a different color, you need a\nlittle less. Now, I've discovered a law of nature --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I may have spent\nmillions on that. And I can't patent that law of\nnature, but I say I didn't; I said apply it. I said\nlook at his little finger.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Is that a good\npatent or isn't it?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No, it's -- it's not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It's not a good patent\nbecause --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you can tell me why not,\nI'll have an understanding of where you're coming from.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because you've -- you've\nadded to a law of nature just -- just a simple\nobservation of the man's little finger.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Now, we're into the\nproblem. And that is the problem of how much you have\nto add.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you look at the Court's\ncases, they seem to say Flook, one thing, and Diehr,\nanother thing.\nAnd so, what is your view about how much has\nto be added to make it an application of a law of\nnature? And how would you put that in words?\nMR. SHAPIRO: There are several things that\nit can't be. After Bilski, which reaffirmed what was\nsaid in Flook, a conventional step isn't sufficient,\nbecause that's just adding a law of nature to prior art,\nand prior art plus prior art equals nothing that is\npatentable under the Flook decision.\nAnd also, the step that you add has to\nnarrow your pre-emption --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Does that\nrender it nonpatentable because it's not novel? Is that\nthe reason why it -- it renders it nonpatentable?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what we're\ntalking about here; we're not talking about novelty, are\nwe?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No, we're really not. What\nthe Court -- what the Court said in Bilski is that a\nconventional step plus a law of nature isn't sufficient,\nand what the Court explained in Flook is that the law of\nnature is part of the common domain; it's part of prior\nart. So, if you're adding prior art to prior art, it's\nnothing under section 101.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, on that\nquestion and the question Justice Scalia just raised,\nthe Government, you know, has taken the position that\nyou're under the wrong section. It's not a question of\npatentability, but you've used the example of the\nfinger; you said it's obvious. So, why didn't you raise\nthe sections that the Government says would have been\nthe appropriate ones on the novelty or anticipation of\nprior art and obviousness?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's a very important\nquestion for the medical community. They need a robust\nsection 101 standard because under 102 and 103 you could\npatent E equals MC squared. That's new. It's\nnonobvious. But you can't patent it under 101 because\nit's a law of nature.\nAnd it's important to keep this -- this\ncommon domain, the storehouse of information that\nmedical researchers need to have access to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's hard to resist the\ntemptation to peek into the obvious component or the\nnonobvious component and then go back and apply it to\n101.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to discipline\nourselves to talk just about 101 in this.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, no, I think -- we have\ntwo arguments on this point. The first is both Flook\nand Bilski peeked, and -- and they looked at the\nconventional nature of the additional step, and\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But once you say\n\"conventional nature,\" you're saying it's not novel.\nIf -- if the step is not conventional, it's okay. Why?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it's novel.\nMR. SHAPIRO: This -- this is the Court's\n101 analysis in both Flook and in Bilski. So, we rely\non the latest decision, Bilski, which took exactly that\npeek. But the other part of our answer is you don't\neven have to peek. If the step doesn't narrow the\npre-emption of the natural phenomenon, if it's just an\nincidental step that you need to use to observe the\nnatural phenomenon, which this blood test is, you can't\nsee the natural phenomenon.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are getting warmer,\nbut --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the words, look,\n\"a simple conventional step.\" Hmmm. You see, whether\nit's true in this case or not, discovering natural laws\nis often a very expensive process.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there's lots of\ninvestment to be protected.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they can't, okay? So,\nnow you're going to say, well, what do they have to add\nto that? And now we run into problems, because if you\nhave to just not look at the law of nature, don't look\nat it when you decide whether it's novel, that not only\nruns into conflict with prior cases, but it doesn't make\nmuch sense because really the novel thing is often the\nlaw of nature. But you say you have to add something.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Our view --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now, that's -- what do\nyou have to add? And it can't be that you take the law\nof nature out and look to whether the rest of it meets\nthe patent criteria. It's -- it's pretty clear in the\nlaw, and I can give you reasons why, but forget the\nreasons.\nBut, look, what do you want to say the rest\nof it has to add up to?\nMR. SHAPIRO: In our view, the rest of it\nhas to add up to some step that limits the natural\nphenomenon, so that you have a concrete, specific --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're going on a\nlimitation thing. So, you're going to say reject all\nthe 15 fancy hypotheticals I'll also spare you.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, in the Diehr -- in the\nDiehr --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's pretty easy to\nthink of the same problem you have, you know, which\ndoesn't have this infinity in it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: In the Diehr case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which unfortunately we have\nto deal with.\nMR. SHAPIRO: In the Diehr case, the natural\nphenomenon was limited with steps that confined the\ninvention to a specific machine with doors opening and\nclosing, temperature being monitored so a product was\ncured. It was a very specific, concrete invention.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I don't know\nwhat -- you keep saying you have to limit the product.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you told me that\nthere's a different range for the treatment of skin\ndiseases.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, presumably, there\nare different ranges for treatment of other diseases.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, this patent has not\nlimited exploration in there. You're claiming it has.\nThat's an issue that your adversary can speak to. I\nthink they say no in their briefs.\nBut the point is there's still a limit to\ntheir range. You're claiming at one point they said it\nwas limitless, but if we disagree with that --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, here's what --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how do you answer\nJustice Breyer's question?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Here's what they say, joint\nappendix pages 13 through 14, the second volume. This\nis their patent. This is what it covers. It covers\nhepatitis, lupus, Hashimoto's disease, Graves' disease,\nAddison's disease, diabetes, arthritis. And they say it\neven covers organ transplants. It covers heart, kidney,\nand liver transplants. So, it covers every autoimmune\ndisease, and there are dozens and dozens of them --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shapiro --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- and they do have different\nnumbers. That's the key point.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, do we -- do we add\nup all of the diseases in the world, all the potential\ndiseases, and pick a percentage that this covers within\nthat range?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think Justice Breyer\nis asking you for something that doesn't involve that --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that involves some\ngreater answer to the issue of limitation.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I -- I think what the Court\ndid in Flook and what it did in Bilski is ask if a broad\nfield is being pre-empted. This is broad numerically.\nIt goes up to infinity. It covers dozens and dozens of\nautoimmune diseases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if you --\nwhat if they just split up the patent? They -- they got\none patent number for arthritis, another patent number\nfor transplants, another patent number for each one of\nthe autoimmune diseases you're talking about?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would each of them be okay,\nbecause it's --\nMR. SHAPIRO: No, it wouldn't. That would\nbe LabCorp, where there was just one malady in the\npatent; it was a vitamin deficiency with a natural\ncorrelation. And Justice Breyer's opinion explained\nthat -- that is too pre-emptive of the natural\nphenomenon.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what my opinion\nlacked, frankly, and that's sometimes the virtue of a\ndissent in such a case, it lacked -- and Novartis points\nthis out very well in their brief -- it lacked an\nexplanation as to why what I thought was a patent just\nsaid observe the correlation.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't that an\napplication of the law of nature? And if you look to\nLabCorp's dissent to find an answer to that question,\nyou're better than I, because I couldn't find it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, if -- if observe the --\nthat's another area of the breadth of this patent,\nbecause there's no specific action the doctor has to\ntake. If the doctor has been informed of their range\nand draws blood and thinks about it, that's -- that\nis -- that is infringement. And a doctor here was\naccused of infringement, treble damages sought against\nthis hospital in an injunction, because she thought\nabout this correlation, and she had completely different\nnumbers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is there -- Mr. Shapiro, is\nthere a patent that Prometheus could have written that\nyou think would have met the 101 test?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Certainly. They could have\nsaid when you reach 400, a real number, a specific\nnumber, you adjust the dosage by 20 percent. That's a\ntreatment patent.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, if they had added a\ntreatment protocol, that would have been a completely\ndifferent case?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And what makes it a\ncompletely different case?\nMR. SHAPIRO: What makes it different is\nthat leaves room for Mayo Clinic to come up with\ndifferent numbers that it believes are more accurate and\nmore helpful for patients that are suffering from these\nlife-threatening diseases. We shouldn't require\nAmericans to get one opinion from Prometheus when they\nwant an opinion from Mayo Clinic.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I'm not sure I\nunderstand that. You said a specific number. But\nsuppose it uses ranges, but it also attaches treatment\ndecisions to those ranges.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, that could be specific\nenough, again, then others could have a rival test that\n-- that used a different treatment protocol. You'd have\nto look at that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, if the idea --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why -- then why\ndidn't you answer her first question that it was -- that\nit was not patentable? I have the same --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I'm having the\nsame trouble as Justice Kagan.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think it would be\npatentable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you just go --\nthe hypothetical was -- was one range, one result.\nPardon me. One measurement, one result. Suppose that\njust continued over a range. And they said if it's 40,\nthen you have this; if it's 50, you have this.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I don't think they\ncan -- they can wipe out the entire field so that others\ncan't have rival tests that use different numbers. They\ntried to do that, by the way. They have a total of\neight patents here which use different numbers. But you\ncan't pre-empt the whole field so others can't make any\nuse of the natural phenomenon.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess the question -- the\nquestion I'm asking is, in your response to me, is the\ndifference the -- the extent of the ranges, or is the\ndifference that there would be clear treatment decisions\nattached to those ranges?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think you'd need both.\nYou'd have to look at it in practical terms. Is there\nroom for somebody else to make use of this natural\ncorrelation, so that they could come up with different\nnumbers, different ranges, and different treatments?\nAnd if there's room left, then there is no pre-emption\nof the natural phenomenon. That's a vastly different\ncase, and that's what is missing here. I -- I do see my\ntime -- yes?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many patents of this\ntype are out there?\nMR. SHAPIRO: My view is there are only a\ncouple of them. LabCorp is like this. This one is like\nthis. The others that are referred to in this -- these\namicus briefs are vastly different. They're specific\npatents with specific treatment protocols. And by the\nway, the Government admits this particular patent is\ninvalid because it just attaches a mental step to prior\nart. And there are only a couple of them to our\nknowledge that would be affected by a decision in our\nfavor.\nBut a decision in our favor would protect\nthe storehouse of information that doctors really need.\nThey have to be able to look at the body's reaction to\ninjections, pills, chemotherapy, radiation; and\ndifferent hospitals have to have different opinions to\nsafeguard the health of our people.\nSo, we urge the Court to reverse, and I\nwould reserve the balance of our time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nEach party in this case has got a valid\npoint. Mayo is correct that you can't get a patent by\ntacking a mental step onto an utterly conventional\nprocess for administering drugs and testing their\neffects. But that is an issue under sections 102 and\n103 of the Patent Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro just told us,\nwhen I asked him that question based on your -- your\nbrief, that people need to know up front that it's --\nthis is not a patentable subject matter; very important\nthat it be 101 and not 102 and 103. So, how do you\nanswer his rejection of the adequacy of prior --\nanticipating prior art or obviousness?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think the answer,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that from the perspective of the\nUnited States and the PTO, it's exactly the opposite;\nthat importing these -- taking -- as Justice Kennedy\nsuggested, taking up the temptation to import a look\ninto novelty and nonobviousness into the 101 inquiry is\ngoing to be very destabilizing; that 101, as Bilski\nsaid, is a threshold eligibility test, and the question\nis whether there is a process.\nHere there is a process. It's the\nadministration of a drug that changes the body\nchemistry, and there's then a test to determine the\nextent of the change, and then there's an inference at\nend of the test. That's a process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- in your test\nfor that -- I see on page 9 of your brief you say: \"a\nclassic patent-eligible process,\" \"recites a series of\nacts, performed in the physical world, that transforms\nthe subject of the process ... to achieve a useful\nresult.\" So, I have a great idea. You take wood, you\nput it on a grate, you light it, and you've got heat.\nThat is -- recites a series of acts performed in the\nphysical world that transforms the subject of the\nprocess, the wood, to achieve a useful result, which is\nheat. So, I can get a patent for that?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. It's not novel, and\n-- and it's obvious.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. No.\nWell, let me put it --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: You can't get a patent\nfor it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's patent --\nthat's patent- eligible.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But that's our -- that's\nour point, Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that the right\nway to look at this issue is under 102 and under 103.\nAnd I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why is the question.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, anything can be\ntransformed into a process. Look at those real estate\nones, the -- I mean, you know, lawyers ones. I have a\nway of making a great argument in the Supreme Court.\nYou know, you could patent some of your arguments.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Most are pretty obvious.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not cut them off at the\npass? That is, if you're really prepared to say -- it\nhas to do with process, not machines. In the 19th\ncentury, not many patent processes were granted. So,\nthey're rather special because of the special problem\nthe Chief just noticed. So, why not --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, here's -- here's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- cut them off at the\npass, if you're prepared to say --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'll add a little bit\nto this because I am questioning what you say here in\nthe other direction. You say if you just look at\neverything minus the law of nature, hmm, and that is a\nprocess that's otherwise known or obvious in light of\nthe prior art, you can't patent it. That seems to me\nmaybe it goes too far the other direction, because we\nknow that a lot of work goes into these laws of nature.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But our position is a\nlittle different.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I -- all right.\nSo, there are both parts, but I'm more interested in --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, if I could --\nif I could, I do think that one has to think about if --\nwhat -- this seems like a straightforward case on these\nfacts, but if one thinks about the principles that Mayo\nis advocating and applying them in a different set of\ncircumstances, I think you'll see the problems.\nTake, for example, nuclear stress tests that\ncardiologists use. That's a process. The patient gets\non a treadmill. The heart rate gets elevated.\nRadioactive dye gets put into the body. It allows an\nimage to be taken of the heart with an X-ray machine.\nThat improves treatment. Now, the transformation there\nis, as in this case, incidental to the process. It's\nnot the point of the process. But I don't think anyone\nwould suggest that that's not a patentable process, but\nunder Mayo's test, it's not a patentable process.\nSimilarly, I think -- I'm sorry,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nsay, what is the great advantage you see of putting this\ncritical question off until the 102, 103 analysis,\nrather than cutting it off at the beginning, 101, which\nI understand your friend to say is very important\nbecause you don't want people to have to pause terribly\nlong to see if this is something they can -- can do?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: As a practical matter, at\nthe PTO, Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't make any\ndifference, because the PTO examiner gets a patent\napplication and answers every question, 101, 102, 103,\n112, and makes a decision about all of them. So, it's\nnot going to lead to any benefit at the PTO.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout litigation? Is it -- it is easier to throw\nsomething out at the threshold level, isn't it, than to\nmove further down the line?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Not -- not if one moves\nthe novelty and the obviousness inquiries from 102 and\n103 into 101. You've just taken --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- the complexity of 102\nand 103 and moved it into 101.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're talking about\nsummary judgment. It seems to me, rough rule, that\nsummary judgment would be much more -- much easier under\n101 than 102 and 103.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think this case is a\npretty good illustration, Justice Kennedy, of why that's\nnot true. Think of -- if I may pick up on the question\nJustice Scalia asked my friend, think of all the trouble\nwe're having in this case figuring out what the standard\nis: How much pre-emption is too much? How do you even\nfigure out the scope of pre-emption? What you're\nactually doing here is multiplying a whole new set of\nvery difficult, complex questions that you don't have to\nanswer if --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, I read you in\npart as saying don't worry, because if something strikes\nyou as wrong with this patent, we're going to catch it\nunder 102. And I guess I'm not sure why that's true.\nThere was novelty here. There were some doctors who\nfigured out some new things, which was new ranges of\neffective drug treatment. And so, why do you think\nyou're going to catch this as a 102 matter? If there is\na problem here, it seems to me not the fact that there\nwas something new. There was something new. It's\nthat -- it's something else.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But there was no new\nprocess, Justice Kagan. There's exactly the same\nprocess that already exists, with a new inference drawn\nat the end, and that's why you can capture this under\n102.\nAnd I do think it's important to think about\nit in terms of the points Mr. Shapiro is making. If\nthis patent had involved -- instead of standard old\nblood tests, had involved a breakthrough new test that\nallowed one to measure metabolite levels in a way that\ncould never have been done before, of course the person\nwho invented that could get this patent, even though it\nwould have the excluding effect that Mr. Shapiro has\nidentified.\nSimilarly, if the drug is a breakthrough\ndrug and a patentable drug, any use of the drug during\nits patented period, including a use in a test like\nthis, would be an infringement under 271.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you about your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the discovery of\na new physical change in the body caused by an old drug?\nYou -- you find that it affects another part of the\nhuman system. Is it -- is that discovery patentable?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think that's a\nharder question, but there are, for example -- and I\nthink the Court was looking at some of this in the\nCaraco case on Monday -- these follow-on patents with\nrespect to pharmaceutical products, where you patent it\noriginally for one use, and then you can later patent it\nwhen you discover a different use. And, in fact,\nthere's an entire regulatory system set up to deal with\nthat. So, I do think there are circumstances in which\nthat can be patentable, yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you about your\nargument that the correlations that were discovered and\nthat are involved here are not natural phenomena because\nthe thiopurine drugs are synthetic products of human\ningenuity? I found that a little difficult to\nunderstand.\nSuppose someone discovers the level at which\na human pollutant that's present in the atmosphere, in\nthe air or the water, has an adverse effect on human\nhealth. Is that not a natural phenomenon?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: The existence of a\npollutant in the air and its effect probably is a\nnatural phenomenon, but the difference here is that\nthere's a conversion of the natural body chemistry. The\nmetabolites wouldn't be in the body but for the\nadministration of these drugs.\nAnd I do think if one were to say that\nthat's an unpatentable natural phenomenon -- and this is\nwhat I mean about the destabilizing risk of thinking\nabout this as a 101 issue rather than 102 or 103 --\nyou're going to call into question lots and lots,\nthousands in fact, of medical use patents where the\npatent is administer a therapeutically effective dosage\nof this drug in order to treat this disease.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but this drug is\npatentable because it's a -- it's a -- what is the third\nword? You know, it's a combination of nature. What's\nthe -- it's a composition of matter.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Breyer, but\nthose patents are not on the composition of matter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, they don't have to be.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Those are process\npatents.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You'd say -- you would say\nthat where it's a new use there were some\nspecifications, and the specifications limited the area\nto over here, I think -- and tell me if I'm wrong\nbecause I'm really asking just a question. They limit\nit over here, you see. And now we have a new use, and\nwe're saying this composition of matter is being used\nover here. So, aren't you getting a -- simply a\ndifferent area where you're using a composition of\nmatter.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, but that's a use\npatent. That's not a composition-of-matter patent\nand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't a process\npatent.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, it's a process\npatent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is a process --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It is a process patent,\nand the problem would be if one says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll think\nabout it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: If one says that it's --\nit's nonpatentable because all you're doing is patenting\nthe application of a law of nature, you're invalidating\nall those process patents.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Bress.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BRESS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to start out, I think, with a --\nanswering the question about what these patents cover\nand what they don't. And I'm going to answer that\nreally not because I think it has any relevance to the\n101 issue. I actually don't think it has any relevance\nto 101. And I'll explain that it does perhaps have\nrelevance under 102 or 103 and why the difference\nmatters, if I may.\nSo, the district -- my friend is correct\nthat in the district court at the initial infringement\nstage, before the court decided validity of the patent,\nwe argued that the right way to look at our numbers was\nthat we were claiming that if a doctor correlated or\nassociated a number greater than 400 with toxicity --\nthat's what we were claiming. That would be within our\nclaim. And if the doctor correlated under 230 with not\nenough drug, well, we were claiming that as well.\nNow, the district court agreed with that and\nsaid that those were the ranges. But then it confused\nthings a bit, and that's where we get to the 15 percent\nplus or minus point. The court also said -- and by the\nway, I think this is a correct reading -- that when we\nsaid about 400, that means plus or minus 15 percent of\n400, and about 230 plus or minus 230.\nAnd then the court held that there was\ninfringement, but it held it for two different reasons.\nIt said that -- that the patent for Mayo -- or the --\nsorry -- not the patent, the product Mayo had, which, by\nthe way, was awfully close -- it was 235 to 450 -- fell\nwithin the 15 percent on the top side. It didn't look\nat the bottom side for purposes of this decision. But\n450 was within 15 percent of 400. And it also said it\nviolated it because 450 is greater than 400.\nAt the court of appeals, we argued that the\nright way to read the district court's opinion was that\nyou had to actually do that comparison, that the ranges,\nthe 15 percents, mattered and that the doctor, in order\nto infringe, would have to look at the result and say is\nthis or isn't this greater than 400, and compare it to\n400, or 230.\nThe court of appeals accepted that reading\nof it, and that reading wasn't disputed by Mayo and, on\npage 3a of the court of appeals' opinion, the court of\nappeals says has to be compared to a predetermined\nnumber.\nI think you could go either way on this. I\nthink, frankly, the Court could go back to the district\ncourt and look at that, perhaps. But the problem with\nthat is that there was no objection at the court of\nappeals. And I think any objection to how the court of\nappeals understood it is probably waived at this point.\nNow for why it doesn't matter. If there's a\nproblem with the broad ranges here, in other words if\nthere is a problem with the fact that we're saying over\n400 indicates toxicity, let's think about what is that\nproblem. Suppose we're right. I mean, at this stage,\nthe Court certainly can't presume we're wrong in that.\nSo, let's suppose that we're right. If we're right,\nthen we're simply claiming the fact that we found, that\nafter you administer the drugs and determine the\nmetabolite level, if it's over 400, it indicates\ntoxicity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that's a natural\nphenomenon.\nMR. BRESS: It is a -- it's according to a\nlaw of nature, and I will agree with that, Your Honor.\nThe term \"natural phenomenon\" as this Court has used it,\nfor instance, in Chakrabarty or in J.E.M., has referred\nto the difference between things that exist in nature\nwith the intervention of man and things that exist\nwithout the intervention of man. So, for example,\nphotosynthesis would be a process that is a natural\nphenomenon. On the other hand, cross-breeding plants to\ncreate a new variety, that wasn't a natural phenomenon.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but if photosynthesis\nis induced by a lamp inside a building, then it's not a\nnatural phenomenon?\nMR. BRESS: If it -- I think you could\nprobably get a patent. I think you could get a patent,\nYour Honor, on the use of a lamp to induce\nphotosynthesis, but you couldn't claim the underlying\nprocess, is all I'm saying, of photosynthesis.\nAccording to this Court's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought of two examples\nthat will try to get you to talk about the problem\nthat's really bothering me here, anyway.\nMR. BRESS: I'd love to, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well. A patent for --\nwe've discovered, at some expense, what counts as too\nlittle fertilizer and what counts as too much to make\nplants grow, a certain kind of fertilizer, very common.\nLess than an quarter of an inch, forget it; more than\nhalf an inch, you're going to burn the plant. Imagine\nthat. Law of nature, absolutely, about the chemicals in\nthe fertilizer. Patent: A method for determining when\nthere's too little or too much fertilizer. Put some\nfertilizer in a field and measure how much there is,\nwherein less than a quarter of an inch is too little and\nwherein more than half an inch is too much.\nSecond example. Einstein never lived, but\nat a vast expense, you invented E equals MC squared,\nokay, a method for measuring energy which is very useful\nthat comes out of a cyclotron. Put some stuff in a\ncyclotron, measure the stuff in and measure how much it\ncomes out, and keep -- wherein -- wherein the missing\npart is -- think about -- wherein -- no, it says wherein\nthe missing part will be calculated as an amount of\nenergy according to a formula E equals MC squared. Yes.\nIf your patent is valid, why aren't the two\nI just mentioned?\nMR. BRESS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you -- if the two I\njust mentioned are valid, there is something wrong with\nthis picture.\nMR. BRESS: Okay, You Honor. I'll answer\nthem in turn, and then hopefully I'll get back to my\nrange and explain what the 102, 103 problems are with\nthat for you all as well.\nThe first patent you've discussed, which is\nhow best to use fertilizer essentially for plants.\nPatent-eligible subject matter, but clearly novel and\nnovel in a way that you could get rid of on summary\njudgment just as fast as you could get rid of it on 101.\nThere's no advantage, in other words, to saying I'm\ngoing to label my summary judgment motion 101 and import\nlack of novelty into that versus saying I'm going to\nlabel --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where is -- where is lack\nof novelty? Nobody has these numbers before. They\nalways thought it was a quarter, an eighth of an inch,\nand -- it's huge novelty.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, the law, as you well\nknow, recognizes that under section 103, if something\nwould have been obvious to someone with ordinary skill\nin the art --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my point --\nMR. BRESS: -- it would fall under\nobviousness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Assume with me the eighth\nversus quarter of an inch, which is the law of nature\npart, is not obvious.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, the first person who\ncame up 10,000 years ago with the best way to do -- to\nuse fertilizer in a way that nobody had ever done before\nwould presumably get it. If your question is at what\nlevel of sort of microns you can draw the line between\nobviousness and novelty, those are -- there are\nquestions of fact embedded in that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. My question is,\nwhat has to be added to a law of nature to make it a\npatentable process?\nMR. BRESS: To make --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you put too little\nin the answer to that question, I believe I can take\nthings like E equals MC squared and make them\npatentable.\nMR. BRESS: Okay. Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you put too much in,\nyou're going to wreck your own case. So, I'm very\ninterested in hearing --\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, I will --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRESS: I will try very hard not to do\neither. Your Honor, this Court has looked at two\ndifferent ways to try to limit what are laws of nature,\nabstract ideas, et cetera. One way it has looked at is\nto say we need something physical; it has to be in the\nworld. In other words, you have to move things, you've\ngot to transform them, you have to apply machinery to\nthem, that sort of thing. So, we just know off the bat\nyou're not literally claiming just a principle in the\nair.\nSo, in your example, if you used, you know,\nmachines, implements, et cetera, to do it, at least we'd\nknow that much. I think the problem that Your Honor is\nraising is more in the second stage, which is, okay, it\nisn't just a mere principle. I get that. But are we as\na practical matter pre-empting an abstract idea in such\na way that we are going to too greatly suppress\nfollow-on invention. And the classic example of that,\nYour Honor, is the Morse case, of course.\nIn Morse, there were two different claims\nthat were being discussed, actually eight different\nclaims being discussed. But one of the claims had to do\nwith the actual invention of how you can make a\ntelegraph work. And Morse described a working telegraph\nsystem, and he got a patent for that.\nAnd the second one that he tried to claim\nwas the use of electricity to write at a distance. And\nthe reason he didn't get that one is that it was\nexpressed at such a level -- high level of abstraction,\nthat it would pre-empt many, many things that he had\nnever invented and never thought of. In fact, the\nCourt's words were wonderful in that case: For aught we\nnow know, the Court said, somebody may come up with\nwonderful inventions in the future. And, of course, now\nwe have the fax machine, e-mail, et cetera.\nThat's the right way to think about it,\nwhich is, is the -- for the second step, which is, is\nwhat's being claimed at such a high level of generality\nthat it's going to inhibit future innovation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why couldn't someone come\nup with the idea that at a level which is in the range\nthat's within your patent, if at a certain level for a\ncertain -- a person of a certain age, you administer a\nnew drug, you have a new result? Why isn't that like\nthe fax machine?\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, in that case, they\ncould get an improvement patent on it, first of all, no\nquestion about it, that they could apply for an\nimprovement patent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the --\nMR. BRESS: They're building on it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Petitioner is saying\nthat if you think about that, it's an infringement.\nMR. BRESS: Well, there's a -- let me\nexplain why I think there's not a problem with that,\nYour Honor. If you looked at the process for\nvulcanizing rubber, which Firestone patented many, many\nyears ago, that involved you heat India rubber to a high\ntemperature, you add sulfur and mineral salts, and that\nway you cure rubber into a usable way of using it.\nNow, many years later in Diehr, this Court\nlooked at a -- an improved process, if you will, for\nmaking rubber which -- which involved continuous\nmeasurement and the use of the Arrhenius equation to\nknow when the rubber was cured. Now, there's no doubt\nthat if somebody came out with a second one 10 years\nafter Firestone had gotten the patent on -- on\nvulcanization, they would have had to pay patent\nroyalties for 10 years before their second one would\nhave been free of patent royalties, right, because they\nwould have had to respect the patent that Firestone got.\nSo, the simple fact, in other words, that\nthere may be further improvements to what you've done\nisn't where the Court has ever drawn the line. And I do\nthink that in conceptualizing where to draw these\nlines -- because at the edges they're indeterminate,\nthey're elusive, and you're going to be somewhat\narbitrary. This is judge-made law. I think that what\nyou've got to look to is what you've done before.\nAnd if we take this case in the spectrum of\nwhat this Court has looked at, where you've got Morse on\none side, on that same side you've got Benson, which was\nsimply a formula for converting binary coded decimals to\npure binary, which the Court said you could use for an\ninfinite number of uses. It was way too broad.\nIf you look at Bilski, a general way of -- a\ngeneral -- the concept of hedging. Now, Bilski was\nlimited, admittedly, and this Court discussed it and\nsaid, well, they've tried to limit it with the\nconventional step of having the inputs determined by\nrandom analysis techniques. I'd like to focus on that\nfor a second, because the Court said that was not\nsignificant extra solution activity. It wasn't enough\nto either render the process a physical one in the world\nor to narrow its scope. Well, why is that? Because\nrandom analysis techniques are themselves just an\nabstract idea. So, you were adding one abstract idea to\nanother one, and it's no wonder the Court found that it\ndidn't narrow it to a patentable scope.\nNow, on the other side of the line, we've\ncases Tilghman. Now, if you look at Tilghman, Tilghman\nwas a patent on the fact that if you use water at a high\nheat and high pressure, you can separate out from fat\nbodies the fatty acids, on the one hand, and the\nglycerin, on the other. And this Court approved a -- a\npatent process on that. Now, that's of course a natural\nlaw, Justice Alito, no question about it, in terms of is\nit a law of nature that makes you do that? Yes.\nBut the Court was comforted in that case by\nthe fact that the patent wasn't trying to generally\npatent -- monopolize the idea that water at high\npressure and temperature is going to in general break\nbonds of chemicals. And it wasn't trying to either\nmonopolize the whole idea of how you can separate fat\nacids and glycerin from fat bodies. There are other\nways, including the use of sulfuric acid.\nLet's place this case in the continuum.\nNow, we're not trying to patent the general broad idea\nthat you can use metabolite readings after you've\nadministered a drug to determine what the likely -- what\nthe best level of the next administration might be.\nThat would be kind of like the Morse patent, and that's\nnot what we're doing. What we're talking about here is\n(a) a very specific class of drugs, the thiopurines,\nused for --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Bress, here's what\nyou have not done. What you haven't done is say at a\ncertain number, you should use a certain treatment; at\nanother number, you should use another treatment. So, I\nguess the first question is, why didn't you file a\npatent like that? Because that clearly would have been\npatentable. Everybody agrees with that.\nMR. BRESS: I agree it would, Your Honor.\nTwo responses if I may.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And I think that the\ndifference people are noting or some people are noting\nis that this is not a treatment protocol. It's not a\ntreatment regimen. All you have done is pointed out a\nset of facts that exist in the world, that exist in the\nworld, and are claiming protection for something that\nanybody can try to make use of in any way. And you're\nsaying you have to pay us.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, I don't agree with\nthat description, but let me explain why.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you might not.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRESS: All right, Your Honor, first of\nall, the -- most of the claims here have three steps.\nSo, you've got an administering step which clearly\ncarries its own benefits with it. It's not -- it's not\nnovel, but it's certainly a process step and in and of\nitself could be a process. We couple that with\ndetermining -- you determine the amount of metabolites,\nand the next step gives the doctor valuable information\nin order to decide what to do next.\nNow, why didn't we say, if it's over 400,\nyou must decrease? Because that doesn't correspond with\nhow doctors practice medicine, Your Honor. So, for\nexample, you've got a patient for whom you've got a\nparticularly sharp outbreak of Crohn's disease. You may\nwell be willing to go above the normal 400 level if your\nother tests, your liver toxicities, your white blood\ncell counts, et cetera, tell you that for this patient\nat this time, given that condition, I'm willing to risk\nsome additional toxicity.\nOn the lower end of the scale, you might\nhave somebody under 230 who seems to be improving. They\nseem to be moving towards remission. Why push it? Why\nincrease? And this is not unusual. And that's one of\nthe things I think I've got to stress here, is the\nnotion of a patent only in the end producing information\nis old in this country. And, by the way, to produce the\ninformation you're always going to have a step at the\nend that is some kind of an algorithm. Might be a very\nsimple one but that takes the data, the raw data, and\nturns it into something useful.\nSo, for example, in the 19th century, there\nwere patents on the use of electricity to locate veins\nof -- of ore and valuable minerals in the ground. Now,\nthat patent didn't say after you found it, you've got to\ndig it out. And according to Mayo, that would have to\nbe the next step. But, of course, you might have\nreasons for digging it out or not digging it out\ndepending on your finances, depending how deep it is,\ndepending on what kind of ore it is, et cetera.\nThere were patents on how to navigate your\nboat in the fog. It was a primitive sonar-based method.\nAnd it didn't tell you in the end, you must steer your\nboat to X and go there. It just told you a likely way\nto go. There was not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about a process that\nall the steps are -- it's a process to -- to generate\nsome useful information.\nMR. BRESS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right? Fine. And the\nonly new thing about it is the useful information.\nAnything like that in history, any patent case that you\ncan -- that comes to mind that you say that was okay?\nCan you think of one?\nMR. BRESS: Actually, Your Honor, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What? Good. That's what I\nwould like to know.\nMR. BRESS: Certainly. For example, there\nwas a patent on the -- and I can talk about modern ones\ntoo, of course, but there was a patent on how to find\nthe -- where there is a leak in a water main, and it was\nusing vibration of the -- of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's not what\nI'm thinking of. I'm thinking of a patent to find\nuseful information that chickens can only eat so much\nchicken food. That nobody has ever known before, you\nknow. Okay. Now -- or something like that. But they\ntell you the useful information that's going to be found\nright in the patent. In other words, we have a patent\nto discover some useful information, and here is the\nuseful information, and now here's -- see, this is what\ntheir complaint is.\nMR. BRESS: I'm not sure that I'm\nunderstanding, Your Honor, because the patent that tells\nyou where to find the ore is telling you what you're\ngoing to find.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you don't know what\nyou're going to find because you don't know how much ore\nyou're going to find? Let's see. Okay. Let me think\nabout it. Thank you.\nMR. BRESS: Well -- and if we talk about\nmodern days, because I think it's helpful now to move\nthis forward, the Court has never suggested that there's\nan extra statutory limitation that prevents patents on\ndeveloping useful information, even if they have a\nmental step at the end. And what would -- what do we\nhave today? We've got inventions out there that,\nthrough identification of biomarkers or measuring the\nbiomarkers, allow us to know which of 10 particular\ncancer drugs is going to work for a particular patient.\nWe've got patents on methods that allow us\nto identify the likely location and size of the next\nearthquake in the San Andreas fault. We've got patents\nthat allow us to determine where there is a crack and\nwhat type of crack in a nuclear reactor core.\nNow, according to Mayo, because all of these\npatents end with a mental step that produces\ninformation, they're no good. Or, perhaps, if you look\nat them and say everything up to that algorithm at the\nend is old, you can't get a patent because you lack\nnovelty.\nNow, it may be to -- it may be in fact,\ndepending on the particular invention, that you should\nlose for lack of novelty on one or other of those, or\nthat you should lose for lack -- for obviousness.\nBut under 101, these are precisely the\nsorts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your view? What's\nyour view?\nMR. BRESS: Okay, Your Honor, I'm happy to\naddress that, too. The answer is no, and here's why.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You should not lose it.\nMR. BRESS: You should not lose it, and this\nis why -- and I'll use my case as a wonderful example.\nSo, in our case, what existed before in the\nprior art, so to speak, was people knew that you could\nadminister thiopurines for these particular diseases.\nAnd, by the way, they're not all diseases; just -- we do\nspecifically exclude in these patents, for example,\nhost-versus-graft disease. We exclude leukemia, et\ncetera. They're not in the asserted patents in this\ncase.\nBut, in any event, administration of\nthiopurines to address certain diseases -- old in the\nart. Different methods for finding analytes in blood\ncells such as high-pressure liquid chromatography -- old\nin the art, no doubt.\nThey were used together before we did them,\nbut why were they used? They were used by people who\nwere trying to come up with what we came up with. They\nweren't doing it for fun. They were administering.\nThey were determining in order to try to find a new\ntreatment method, a new way of calibrating the right\ndose for each individual patient based on their\nmetabolism, and help seriously ill patients.\nAnd the idea that we are not novel because\npeople took some of the same steps along the way to\ninvention that we actually succeeded in is wrong. And,\nin fact, this Court said so in American Wood-Paper,\nwhere it said that incomplete and unsuccessful attempts\nto invent will not render not novel the successful\ninventor.\nAnd, in Bell, the Court said the difference\nbetween those who -- those who did not get the patents\nand Bell was only the difference between failure and\nsuccess, and didn't say that because many of them had\nused similar methods but had not understood that\ncontinuous electrical lines as opposed to intermittent\nor pulsing electrical lines was going to be the\ndifference for a working telephone.\nSimilar here. I don't think we ought to\nlose on novelty for that ground. But let's put that to\nthe side, because that's for remand, and it's something\nthat, you know, hopefully, I'll get a chance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose somebody thinks\nyou're wrong, that the numbers you've come up with are\nwrong. And they want to develop better numbers that\nwill -- will help the medical profession. Your patent\nexcludes them from doing that, right?\nMR. BRESS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. BRESS: And let's explain why not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. BRESS: And I'll even take for purposes\nof this explanation my brother's example of over 400 and\nunder 230, because I don't think it matters. So, you've\ngot Dr. el-Azhary, who believes that the right ceiling\nlevel is 300. Okay? So, if she sees a patient and\nsays, I'm going to -- you know, I associate 290 with\ntoxicity, that won't violate our patent in the least.\nOur patent says if you associate over 400 with toxicity,\nthat's within our range. If she associates 290 with\ntoxicity, no violation.\nNow, getting more to the point, though, if\nwe're totally wrong -- let's assume we're off base\nand -- and this doesn't work at all. There's another\npart of section 101 that addresses that, and that's\nutility.\nAnd, certainly, Mayo would be able to come\ninto court and say that patent has no utility. It's\ncompletely wrong. In fact, it's killing patients. And\ntry to invalidate us on that ground. Similarly, suppose\nat the very edges of the spectrums that we're claiming,\nthe answer is obvious. The answer is not novel. They\ncan seek to try to invalidate our patents on that basis\nas well.\nThis -- these aren't 101 problems.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me\nthat's your -- the problem with your whole approach is\nthat every time you're pressed on 101, your answer is to\nfall back to 102 or 103 or the utility part of 101. And\nI'm just wondering why it's beneficial to essentially\neliminate 101 and say, oh, we'll catch everything later\non.\nMR. BRESS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; I\nappreciate the question.\nI -- I think that the answer is that when\nthe problem is lack of novelty, when the problem is\nobviousness, the right place to go are the sections that\nactually have very clear rules on how to apply those,\nand that the problem with taking a short cut in that\ninstance is, essentially, the court would just imbue its\nown notions or preconceived notions of what should be\npatentable and pour it into it as opposed to following\nthose rules.\nAnd, of course, if you're going to follow\nthese rules, you might as well follow them under that\nsection. Now, it doesn't completely leave 101 bereft.\nThis Court has said 101's very broad, but it does have\nlimitations. And if you look at a case like Morse --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just to --\nMR. BRESS: -- I think it helps explain it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry to interrupt.\nYour friend's point is that if you don't do this -- if\nyou don't give 101 some more content, then the doctor is\ngoing to have to start worrying right from the get-go\nand then see, well, is there an exception that I might\nbe able to rely on, as opposed to being able to say\nright away this -- I don't have to worry about this\npatent; I can treat the patient in this way.\nMR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor, again, if --\nif it's very clear that we're not novel. For example,\nif -- if the Government is correct here that facially we\nlack novelty, it's no harder to proceed under 102 to\nachieve that goal than it is under 101. If you're going\nto proceed under 101, then we'll talk about principles\nthat 101 is for.\nSo, 101 -- I think the primary -- the two\nthings it's for -- it has to be a process in the\nphysical world, a hands-on process, and it can't be so\nbroad that it pre-empts all follow-on innovation. Those\nare the two things -- you know, this Court speaks sums\nabout the statutory language, and it has to do some\nwork. That's the work that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it's novel? What's\nyour answer about why this is novel?\nMR. BRESS: Right. Your Honor, before\nPrometheus -- actually, the inventors in this case in\nMontreal came up with this method, doctors had no way to\ntailor for each individual based on their metabolism the\nright dosage of these powerful but potentially toxic\ndrugs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shapiro, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Justice Scalia asked the\ncritical question here: What if you think these numbers\nare wrong? What happens with patients around the\ncountry? Well, that's just what we concluded: These\nnumbers were wrong. They say you go up to 400, and\nabove 400, it's bad, it's harmful. We found that the\nright range was 450 up to 700, and sometimes even above\n700, to cure some of these very serious diseases. And\nthat different opinion was blockaded by this treble\ndamages lawsuit and request for an injunction.\nSo, the -- the wrong information is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He says the solution to\nthat is -- your saying their patent is not useful.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That it's not useful --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be your defense.\nMR. SHAPIRO: It's important that 101 be the\nrobust test here. This is the only provision under\nwhich this Court has issued decision after decision for\n150 years protecting the public domain. It's not some\nrough gauge; it is the critical test defining what's in\nthe storehouse of information for medical researchers to\nuse. And to reduce it to a dead letter here would be\njust contrary to this Court's precedents and very\nharmful to the medical community. This is very\nimportant to -- to doctors around the country.\nNow, is this a natural process? The\nquestion was raised. Of course, it's a natural process.\nThese metabolites come from the liver. They don't come\nfrom a test tube. They don't come from a syringe. It's\njust like cholesterol. If I eat in a French restaurant,\nthere's some human intervention there that gives me high\ncholesterol. And if I eat wild strawberries, there's no\nhuman intervention. But either way, the doctors get to\nlook at my cholesterol and hypothesize ranges that they\nthink are sensible. It's the very same phenomenon.\nEntirely natural.\nNow, this is a clean legal issue. Under\nsection 101, it's always been a legal issue. They say\nsection 102 and 103 are the most elusive questions in\nthe field of patent law. This is a 7-year-old lawsuit\nagainst a hospital; it's cost millions of dollars to\ndefend. Two trips to this Court, two trips to the\nFederal Circuit. We're still litigating this treble\ndamages case. It should be terminated under this\nCourt's precedents, as the district court did giving\nsummary judgment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess my problem is,\nif we call this just simply an application of natural\nphenomenon or of a natural process, why are treatment\npatents at all --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- permissible, meaning\nif someone finds out that at level 300, it's bad, and\ntells doctors to stop, that's natural, too.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. Well, I think that's\nright. That's -- that is a second issue. But the first\nissue here is the breadth of the pre-emption, which\nprecludes anyone else in the country from saying, as\nJustice Scalia did, those numbers are wrong. And\npatients can't use those numbers safely or they won't\nget cured of this disease. For 20 years, the public is\nstuck with the erroneous information.\nNow, counsel suggests that it's narrow\npre-emption because it doesn't cover host-versus-graft\nor leukemia. Those are not autoimmune diseases. Every\nautoimmune disease is swept in here. And there are\ndozens and dozens of them. They have different\ncharacteristics. You don't take a \"one size fits all\"\napproach to autoimmune disease. There are different\nnumbers for different diseases.\nThat's what Mayo is trying to do, to have\nsome personalized medicine for skin disorders. And they\nsaid that -- that is an infringement and we're entitled\nto treble damages and an injunction.\nNow, is this like the Morse case? Yes, it\nis like the Morse case. Prometheus is trying to\npre-empt diseases it never researched, and it's trying\nto pre-empt numbers that differ from its numbers\nfundamentally.\nThey have the number 7000 in their patented\nnumber. We thought the number should be 5700. This is\na very dangerous toxic drug. If you get the -- the\nwrong number set in concrete for 20 years, that is a\nhuge problem for patients, and there are millions and\nmillions of patients suffering from autoimmune disease.\nSo, we urge the Court to protect the\nresearch process here that's so fundamental to American\nhealth and to economy and the health care industry.\nWe thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
