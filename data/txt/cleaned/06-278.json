STARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIllegal drugs and the glorification of the\ndrug culture are profoundly serious problems for our\nnation. Congress has so recognized, as has this Court,\ntime and again. The magnitude of the problem is\ncaptured in the amicus brief, the Court has a number of\namicus briefs before it, but the amicus brief of General\nMcCaffrey, Secretary Bennett, and a number of\norganizations. And particularly, pages 5 to 9 of that\nbrief, the nature and the scope of the problem are\nwell-captured.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is this case limited\nto signs about drugs? What is the rule that you want us\nto adopt for deciding this case?\nMR. STARR: The rule the Court -- that it\narticulated in Tinker. The rule of the Court as\narticulated in Tinker is that there is, in fact, a right\nto political speech subject to disruption, requirements\nthat the speech not be disruptive.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Disruptive of what?\nDisruptive of the classroom order? There was no\nclassroom here.\nMR. STARR: Including but not limited to.\nThis was a school authorized event, this was education\noutside of the classroom. It was essentially a school\nsimply out of doors. It was essentially --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I can understand if\nthey unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be\ndisruptive, but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk?\nMR. STARR: The educational mission of the\nschool.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean, that's at a\nlevel of generality that doesn't get us very far. I\nmean, what specifically did it disrupt? Did it disrupt\nthe parade, did it disrupt teaching, what was it?\nMR. STARR: 5520, a school policy of the\nboard that says emphatically that political speech is\nprotected, embracing Tinker.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then if that's the rule,\nthe school can make any rule that it wants on any\nsubject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates\nit, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive\nunder Tinker.\nMR. STARR: Not at all. I think that in\nform --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then I'm missing the\nargument.\nMR. STARR: The argument is that this Court\nin Tinker articulated a rule that allows the school\nboards considerable discretion both in identifying the\neducational mission and to prevent disruption of that\nmission, and this is disruptive of the mission --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have --\nsuppose you have a mission to have a global school. Can\nthey ban American flags on lapel pins?\nMR. STARR: Absolutely not, because under\nTinker that is political expression. Let me be very\nspecific. This case is ultimately about drugs and other\nillegal substances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the sign had been\n\"Bong Stinks for Jesus,\" that would be, and Morse had\nthe same reaction, that this was demeaning to the\nOlympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be\na protected right under Tinker because the message was\nnot promoting drugs?\nMR. STARR: She stated in her answers to\ninterrogatories that she may very well not have\ninterfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize\nmarijuana. Under our theory, we think she could have\ninterfered with that because it was disruptive to the\nevent, it was disorderly to the event itself, but the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What would be disorderly?\nI don't understand this disorder. If somebody holds up\na sign and says change the marijuana laws, why is it\ndisruptive of anything, simply because the school quite\nnaturally has said we support the enforcement of the\nlaw, and the law right now does forbid the use of\nmarijuana.\nMR. STARR: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's political speech, it\nseems to me. I don't see what it disrupts, unless\ndisruption simply means any statement of disagreement\nwith a position officially adopted by the school. Is\nthat what you mean by disruption?\nMR. STARR: No. Your Honor, first of all,\nthis is, I think, an unusual characterization, namely\nfor this to be called political speech. We would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If it's calling -- I mean\n--\nMR. STARR: We think it's a First -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: A call for a change in the\nlaw, I would have supposed, was political speech.\nMR. STARR: That wasn't the interpretation.\nYour Honor, let's back up, if I may. Someone has to\ninterpret the message and the front line message\ninterpreter is the school official. The school official\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but\nthat's not the hypo. The -- the hypothetical is, what\nif there is a sign or a statement in the school calling\nfor a change in, you know, the prohibition against\nmarijuana use? As a call for change in the law, I would\nsuppose it was political speech. But as I understood\nthe argument you were making, it would still be regarded\nas an exception, as it were, to Tinker, because it was\ndisruptive. And it was disruptive in the sense that it\ndisagreed with official school policy, which was to\nenforce the law or support the law as it was. Is that\nyour position on what disruption means under Tinker?\nMR. STARR: But our -- the answer is no.\nBecause what we are also urging the Court to consider is\nits gloss on Tinker and Frazier, and also what this\nCourt said in Kuhlmeier. And in Frazier, the Court was\nvery clear, the first three paragraphs in part three of\nthe opinion, in talking about the habits and manners of\ncivility, and inculcating the values of citizenship.\nThat, in fact, is what is happening here. There is an\neffort of the -- to prevent a message that is\ninconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools,\nwhich is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten,\nand we believe that is permitted under Tinker --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you want to get away\nfrom a hypothetical then. I don't know why you try to\ndefend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says\namend the marijuana laws. That's not this case as you\nsee it, is it?\nMR. STARR: Well, it's certainly not this\ncase, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This banner was interpreted\nas meaning smoke pot, no?\nMR. STARR: It was interpreted -- exactly,\nyes. It was interpreted as an encouragement of the drug\nculture and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you arguing that there\nshould be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates\nillegal drug use, or this broader argument that the\nschool can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with\nits educational mission as the school --\nMR. STARR: I think that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- defines it?\nMR. STARR: I apologize. The Court can\ncertainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there\nare certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include\nalcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy,\nbecause those are illegal substances which are very\ninjurious to health. And this Court has noted that in\nBernonia and in Earls, time and again, it is that these\nare very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy\nsanctioned by Congress, and also noted by courts across\nthe country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that\nschools are entitled to have a message going --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem --\nthe problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days\ntake it upon themselves to broaden their mission well\nbeyond education or protection from illegal substances,\nand several of the briefs have pointed out school boards\nhave adopted policies taking on the whole range of\npolitical issues. Now, do they get to dictate the\ncontent of speech on all of those issues simply because\nthey have adopted that as the part of their educational\nmission?\nMR. STARR: No, because that may very well\nbe inconsistent with Tinker. Tinker articulates a\nbaseline of political speech is, in fact, protected,\nsubject to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that\n-- I think you're right about that, and I guess my\nquestion goes to how broadly we should read Tinker. I\nmean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum\nfor political debate simply because the students want to\nput that on their agenda? Presumably the teacher's\nagenda is a little bit different and includes things\nlike teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem,\nand just because political speech is on the student's\nagenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker\nso broadly as to include protection of those, that\nspeech.\nMR. STARR: This Court has not read Tinker\nquite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and\nthere are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are\nworthy of note. One, that there was no written policy\nthere, so there was an issue of standardless discretion\nbeing exercised. And also --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it may have made a\ndifference in Tinker. If the school had a policy,\ndefend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought\nthis into the category that you are now carving out?\nYou said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the\nschool did have a policy, patriotism, we support our\ntroops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam. Should\nTinker have come out the other way?\nMR. STARR: No, it should not, because there\n-- I think there are concerns with respect to what this\nCourt has identified it is trying to, even in the public\nschool setting, quite apart from the university setting,\nto cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of\nideas. What is happening here of course in this case,\nit can be decided very narrowly, that drugs, alcohol and\ntobacco just have no place in the schools. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the rule you\nproposed, I thought, in response to my question is that\nthe school has wide discretion to define its educational\nmission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent\nwith that mission.\nMR. STARR: And that's what this Court in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's\nmuch broader than Tinker. Now you said, well, there is\nan exception for political speech. Well, but then\nyou're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's\nsuppose that they have a particular view on a political\nissue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and\nso forth.\nMR. STARR: Justice Kennedy, the words that\nyou articulated are essentially quotes of Frazier and\nKuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a\nrestoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in\nthose two cases than one might see in Tinker. They of\ncourse drew, as you well know, from Justice Black's\nwarning in dissent of Tinker that the Federal courts,\nFederal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly\ninto the work of the school boards' --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we have to get into\nthe question of what the school board's policy is and\nwhat things they can make its policy? Surely it can be\nthe -- it must be the policy of any school to discourage\nbreaking of the law. I mean, suppose this banner had\nsaid kill somebody, and there was no explicit regulation\nof the school that said you should not, you should not\nfoster murder. Wouldn't that be suppressible?\nMR. STARR: Of course. That is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it would, so --\nMR. STARR: The answer is yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't we decide this\ncase on that narrow enough ground, that any school\nwhether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress\nspeech that advocates violation of the law?\nMR. STARR: I think it can, but it raises\nsome interesting potential hypothetical questions, what\nabout listening to the voice of Martin Luther King\nJunior, conscientious objection and so forth. I don't\nthink the Court needs to stray into those areas because\nhere we have a written policy which does in fact respond\nto concerns about the exercise of standardless\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just clear up one\nthing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position.\nIt does -- the message is the critical part of this\ncase. If it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot\nsign, that would be okay. You're not saying 15-foot\nsigns are disruptive?\nMR. STARR: Not inherently disruptive, but\nin fact -- the answer is yes. We're not saying that\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so we're focusing on\nthe message and that's the whole crux of the case.\nMR. STARR: That's why this case is here\nbecause of the message.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is that? Why?\nWhy? I mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the\nteacher says on the school trip, I don't want people\nunfurling 15 foot banners. I don't care what they are\nabout.\nMR. STARR: It may very well be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are going to visit the\nstate capital and we are not marching down the street\nwith 15 foot banners. I mean, does the First Amendment\nsay the teacher can't say that?\nMR. STARR: It does not. But the Juneau\nschool board and 5520, Justice Breyer, allows -- in fact\nit has a Tinker statement in the first paragraph of\n5520, which is also, you will not be advocating drugs.\nAnd so there is essentially a culture of liberty in\nJuneau. You don't have to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You just said suppose --\nwhy should I not say that? I mean I'm not going to do\nit, necessarily. But why could I not say, would it be\nwrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a\nschool trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot\nbanners? Is that a correct statement of the law or not?\nIn your opinion.\nMR. STARR: In my opinion it is a correct\nstatement of the law. But in response to Justice\nStevens' question, the message here is in fact critical\nbecause what we know about this case is that, and you're\nhere of course to respond to this case, which has to do\nwith a message that the message interpreter, Deborah\nMorse, who by the way --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's also critical here to\nyour case that it was a school event. If it, if this\nhad have been two blocks down the street there would\nhave been no objection.\nMR. STARR: If Mr. Frederick had seen fit to\ngo down Glacier Avenue to J and J's, a popular hangout,\nthere would have been no high school jurisdiction.\nThere may have been elementary school -- but yes. He\ncould have gone, Justice Stevens, to the State capital\nor anywhere along the ten mile route.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it were Saturday\ninstead of a weekday.\nMR. STARR: I beg your pardon.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it were Saturday,\nnot a school day. And the school children were not\nrequired to show up at the Olympic event but were\nencouraged to and the same thing happened. Would it\nmake a difference that it wasn't in the course of a\nregular school day?\nMR. STARR: No. I think it still, under\nyour hypothetical would be school sponsored. But there\nmight be a more difficult showing of disruption or\ninconsistency with the educational mission. That is\nwhat this Court articulated in Frazier and again in\nKuhlmeier that the school is able under our policies of\nfederalism and value of federalism and democratic theory\nto fashion its educational mission subject to\nconstitutional safeguards. And that mission of\npreventing the schools from being infected with pro-drug\nmessages continues wherever there is school\njurisdiction, and that would include on a Saturday field\ntrip or other kind of activity and I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Starr, you -- you\nresponded to Justice Breyer that you think the school\ncould just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on\na trip. Could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands\non a trip?\nMR. STARR: I don't believe so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if not -- if not,\nwhat's the difference?\nMR. STARR: Because of the potential for\ndisruption, disorderliness in the event and the judgment\nthat is entrusted to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we have to be\nmore specific about the context in determining whether\nthere's disruption? If it's a school trip to an art\nmuseum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the\npictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object\nof the trip. Unfurling a banner in a classroom is going\nto be disruptive to the teaching of Shakespeare or\nwhatever is supposed to be going on in there.\nWhat we have here is the unfurling of a\nbanner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing\nsnowballs waiting for some -- somebody to run by with a\nTV camera nearby. And there is a real question as to\nwhether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind\nof practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything.\nAnd if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer\nfavor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to\nfavor the right to suppress it?\nMR. STARR: Your Honor, the answer is no.\nWe do think that if the test that this Court\nhas articulated which we embrace, looks not simply to\n\"disruption\" but inconsistency with what this Court has\nfocused -- this Court's language, the basic educational\nmission, then surely --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me, let me\nfollow, actually ask you the same question on -- on\nthat. Because in response to Justice Scalia's question\nyou said certainly that the school has got the right to\nhave a policy that forbids violating the law and calling\nfor violations of the law.\nAccepting that as a premise, don't we need,\nbefore the school may suppress the speech, don't we need\nat least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with\nthat policy? And if that is so, is Bong Hits 4 Jesus\ninconsistent with it? It sounds like just a kid's\nprovocative statement to me.\nMR. STARR: Your Honor, with all due\nrespect, the key is to allow the school official to\ninterpret the message as long as that interpretation is\nreasonable. You might disagree with that just as\nJustice Brennan disagreed with whether Matt Frazier's\nspeech was all that terrible. But he said even though\nit wasn't all that terrible I nonetheless defer to the\ninterpretation of school officials. That's what our\neducational system is about.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those were the words\nand characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could\nlook at these words and say it's just nonsense. Or one\ncould say it's like mares-eat-oats. It isn't clear that\nthis is \"smoke pot.\"\nMR. STARR: Your Honor, again, Deborah\nMorse, a conscientious principal, interpreted the\nmessage in light of the subculture of the school where\ndrug use is a serious problem. And it was on the spot\njudgment. We believe that judgment was reasonable as\nopposed to a judgment reached in judicial chambers, but\nwe know that that was also the judgment of the\nsuperintendent and district judge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a judgment clear\nenough as a matter of law, or is there possible debate\nas to whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the\nmessage? Let's assume it was an ambiguous message.\nWould we have to accept her interpretation on summary\njudgment?\nMR. STARR: Yes, I believe you do. And --\nwell, that's of course a question for the district\njudge. And here the judge analyzed the facts in terms\nof what the individual was trying to say and determined\nthat that is a reasonable interpretation and that is all\nthat is required under this Court's law.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThe First Amendment does not require public\nschool officials to stand aside and permit students who\nare entrusted to their supervision and care to promote\nor encourage the use of illegal drugs. As this Court\nobserved in Earls, the nationwide drug - drug epidemic\nmakes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every\nschool.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that the rationale\non which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more\nbroad?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The Court need not decide\nanything more broadly than that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking what your\nrecommendation is to what our rule should be this case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think this is a\nmanifestation of the principle articulated in Earls and\nrepeated in Hazelwood that a, school does not have to\ntolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic\neducational --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's a very -- I\nfind that a very, a very disturbing argument, because\nschools have and they can defined their educational\nmission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of\npolitical speech and speech expressing fundamental\nvalues of the students, under the banner of, of -- of\ngetting rid of speech that's inconsistent with\neducational missions.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's why I think there\nwould, there would be, it would make a lot of sense for\nthe Court to articulate a rule that had to do with\nencouraging illegal conduct and particularly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why go into this? I\nmean, that's what I actually, seriously don't\nunderstand. Suppose the rule has the following rule:\nby the way, on our field trips you can carry around 15\nfoot banners. They can say anything. Except they can't\ntalk about drugs and they can't talk about sex and they\ncan't talk about -- I don't know. Or I'd say three\nthings. Would that be constitutional?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well -- I think, I think a\nschool could certainly prohibit the display of banners\non a school trip or in a school assembly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that this\nparticular person had whispered to his next door\nneighbor, \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus, heh heh heh,\" you know.\nSupposed that's what had happened?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that may well -- that may\nwell be different. And that's why I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. What would be\ndifferent -- that's what I -- what a principal that has\nto act quickly sees across the street at a school\nmeeting, a big banner go up making a joke out of drug\nuse. So the principal acts.\nNow, are we supposed to divide that into\nlittle bitsy parts? Because as soon as we do we are\ngoing to get a rather interesting, complicated and very\ndifficult set of constitutional rules. But you want us\nto do that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I do not. I think -- I\nthink the point that you make that a principal sees the\nbanner across the street and sees the word bong hits,\nand -- and at the very moment when the Olympic torch was\nabout to arrive, I think it was. She made a quick\njudgment and an entirely reasonable one that the display\nof the slang words bong hits --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you're not\narguing for the broad educational mission, which is what\nyou said at the first.\nMR. STARR: Well, there are several\ngradations that the Court could take: Advocacy of\nillegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of\nillegal drugs. But I believe -- I think it's important\nto recognize that this Court's precedents recognize --\nrecognize several different justifications for\nrestricting student speech. In Tinker itself which\ndealt with political speech, the Court was careful to\npoint out that even then, if the speech could be shown\nto present a threat of a material disruption to the\nclass work, and I think this would answer your question,\nMr. Chief Justice, if the teacher wants to teach\nShakespeare, the teacher doesn't have to turn over the\nclass to political speech.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's a\nviewpoint-neutral regulation. This isn't, the principal\ndidn't say this was a viewpoint-neutral regulation, did\nshe?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No. And -- and, and\njust to finish, in Tinker even with a viewpoint concern,\nthe Court said if you could show material disruption,\nand --- and the Court made that clear in Tinker, by, by\nits comparison to several lower court decisions where\nwearing buttons had been prohibited because they had\ncaused disruption. And the third category in Tinker\nitself was where there would be an intrusion upon the\nrights of other students to be secure and be let alone.\nThat's Tinker dealing with political speech.\nBut in Frazier and Hazelwood the Court\nidentified additional categories of speech that could be\ngoverned by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of\nHazelwood. The Court made clear that the ability to\nregulate those categories of speech goes beyond the\nquestion of whether there would be disruption or whether\nthere would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think\nthat the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete\nbutton that says \"legalize marijuana,\" although it might\nbe covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it\ncould be inconsistent with the school's mission and\nprohibited on that basis?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think -- I think if,\nif the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum\nin the State, then that, that might be the category of\npolitical speech that could not be regulated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And at -- at this very\nrally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay\nto work for change in existing law which such a sign\nwould be, but it is not okay to violate the law. And no\none was smoking pot in that crowd.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but the, what was\nhappening was a sign that was reasonably construed to\nencourage the use of illegal drugs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Given the fact\nthat this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court\nforced into the position if it's going to be consistent\nwith what else we have said, even at the final appellate\nlevel, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the\nstatement itself in determining whether it may be\nsuppressed or punished?\nAnd if we do that, is it such a reasonable\nconstruction that this is an -- an incitement to illegal\ndrug use?\nI mean it's a statement which makes, makes\nthe drug law look a little ridiculous, I think, but I'm\nnot sure that that is very distinguishable from a\nstatement saying \"you ought to change the drug law.\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I -- I think in,\nin this Court's decisions dealing with public schools,\nthis Court has, has a consistent theme as to give\ndeference to the judgments by the educators. Public\nschools --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have to give -- let\nme ask you this. And maybe this is the, as far as we\ncan go with it here.\nIs that the answer to the question here\nabout what the statement means?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, if we give\ndeference your argument wins. But if we don't give\ndeference, then does anybody really know what the\nstatement means?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think the question is\nwhat Mr. Frederick intended. The question is what a\nreasonable observer would think. And the words \"bong\nhits\" are slang that would be particularly, have a\nparticular characteristic of getting across to other\nstudent, and they suggest a casual tolerance and\nencouragement of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the sign said\n\"bong hits should be legal?\"\nMR. KNEEDLER: I, I think that would be a\njudgment call. I think the, I think the casual use --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under your view wouldn't\nthe principal's judgment always prevail?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well it has to be a\nreasonable judgment and this is, this is reflected in\nFrazier.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a question of fact\nor a question of law?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is whether it's a\nreasonable judgment --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think ultimately it's a\nquestion of law, whether it's a reasonable judgment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This, this -- this parade\nhad a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with -- the high\nschool kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it.\nAnd suppose the banner said vote for, vote Republican,\nvote Democrat. And he wants to be on the TV with that.\nCould this, the principal make him take that sign out of\nthe ground in that it's inconsistent with the whole\ntheme of, of, of the parade? Something like our Kurle\ncase?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I mean, I think\nfor this reason. This was essentially an outdoor\nassembly, where the -- whether the students were\nassembled to watch a particular different, just as in an\nindoor assembly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that different from the\nrationale you've put.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Again, that's why I\ndon't think there's any one single rule that governs all\ncases. This, this I think falls under the Frazier\nstandard, where the Court said that, that schools have a\nduty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare\nstudents for citizenship, and not violating the law is\nan important part of that and teachers' act in loco\nparentis. They act as guardians and they should be able\nto do, as this Court says in Earls, what a reasonable\nguardian would do. That would mean don't allow people\nto encourage lawbreaking.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't, it wasn't\nlike an assembly, was it? As I understand it, the\nchildren were released from school, but they were not\nrequired to attend this event and they were not required\nto stand in front of the school on the opposite side.\nThey weren't monitored by their teachers, so they -- and\nthere were nonstudents in the crowd. So it's not like a\nschool assembly.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The students' present at the\nevent, presence as the event, was like an assembly.\nStudents may go into an assembly hall and not have to\nsit with their class. They were released from class,\nbut they were not released from school or school\nsupervision. There were teachers around there and the\nschool could define what is the nature of our assembly\nat this public event and, just as in, in the auditorium\na school could say there will be no political banners\nor, frankly, no banners about anything other than what\nthe event is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Were they required to go to\nthis event and could they have skipped off and gone home\nwithout violating --\nMR. KNEEDLER: They were not allowed to go\nhome. They were required, they were required --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were required to\nattend.\nMR. KNEEDLER: They were required to be\nthere if the classroom teacher decided to let them go\nout there, but they were under school supervision at\nthat time.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Were they ever told what\nthey were supposed to do in the sense did the school\never say, we are letting you out on the street to\ncelebrate the Olympics and to do only that? Was, was\nthere an object to this release from the school building\nthat was ever conveyed?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If I may, I don't think\nthere's any question that he knew in advance that this\nwas about the Olympics. That's why he made the sign.\nAnd they were released to go out and watch the torch go\nby. He hasn't raised any question of notice or due\nprocess concerns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mertz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS K. MERTZ, ESQ.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MERTZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court: This is a case about free speech. It\nis not a case about drugs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a case about\nmoney. Your client wants money from the principal\npersonally for her actions in this case.\nMR. MERTZ: He does have a damages claim\nagainst the school district and the principal, but\nthat's by no means his chief object here. The\noverwhelming object is to assert his free speech --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you waive\ndamages against this principal who has devoted her life\nto the school, and you're seeking damages for her for\nthis sophomoric sign that was held up?\nMR. MERTZ: We are certainly willing to\nnegotiate a minimum settlement of damages. That is not\nthe object here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a\nbroader issue of whether principals and teachers around\nthe country have to fear that they're going to have to\npay out of their personal pocket whenever they take\nactions pursuant to established board policies that they\nthink are necessary to promote the school's educational\nmission.\nMR. MERTZ: That is indeed a legitimate\nfear, Your Honor, and we believe the existing law takes\ncare of it by requiring before qualified immunity can be\nbreached that there be a demonstration that under the\nexisting law at the time available to her --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think it was\nclearly established that she had to allow a student at a\nschool- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner\nsaying \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\"?\nMR. MERTZ: I think it was clearly\nestablished at the time, Your Honor, that a principal\ncould not engage in viewpoint censorship of a\nnondisruptive expression, under both Ninth Circuit law\nand this Court's law. The case had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does that, does that\ngeneral statement that you just made apply to all\ncircumstances in which a student-teacher relationship\nmight be involved? For example, in the course of\nteaching a class in Shakespeare would your rule prevail?\nMR. MERTZ: The rule on qualified immunity?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, the general rule which\nthe teacher is supposed clearly to have known here. For\nexample, in the Shakespeare class, kid doesn't, doesn't\nsay anything. He doesn't yell or scream or even raise\nhis hand. He just holds a little sign in the\nShakespeare class that says \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus.\" As I\nunderstood the general rule that you said the teacher\nwas bound to know here, the teacher I suppose would be\nrequired or the school would be required to tolerate\nthat sign in the Shakespeare class; is that correct?\nMR. MERTZ: I believe the analysis would be\nthe Tinker analysis in terms of substantial disruption\nof the lesson.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would there be a\nsubstantial disruption?\nMR. MERTZ: It would all depend on the\ncircumstances. My guess is that if it were simply\npassively --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the kids look around and\nthey say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- they then return, they\nthen return to MacBeth. Does the -- does the, does the\nteacher have to, does the school have to tolerate that\nsign in the Shakespeare class?\nMR. MERTZ: I believe that in circumstances\nwhere it is a substantial distraction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can't it just say no\nsigns when you're supposed to be learning?\nMR. MERTZ: Your Honor, I think the answer\nis yes if they had a content-neutral rule prohibiting\nsigns in school. I believe that would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can't the school\ndecide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent\nits student from engaging in drug use and so that it's\ngoing to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint\nis going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it\ntakes a particular view with respect to signs that in\ntheir view seem to encourage drug use?\nMR. MERTZ: Certainly it is within the\nschool's mission to discourage drug use. Certainly it\nhas many tools to allow it to get its own viewpoint --\ncertainly it can -- it does not need to provide a forum\nin the school itself for students with a contrary\nviewpoint. But when a student is basically on his own\ntime, whether it's outside of school --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position\nwould be different if this were in the student gym and\nthey were having a discussion. There was a program to\ndiscourage drug use and he held up his sign; you would\nsay it would be all right to take down the sign inside\nthe school gym?\nMR. MERTZ: No, I'm not so sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter\nthat this is outside. It matters on the content of the\nsign, not the location?\nMR. MERTZ: Well, what matters is whether\nthere is a substantial disruption of what the school is\ntrying to achieve legitimately, whether it's a classroom\nlesson or a lesson on drug use.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the school has --\nthe school has a program, an anti -drug program that\nshows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers\nto preach against drug use and you're saying that --\nnever mind unfurling a banner. You're saying that it\nhas to let students contradict this message it's trying\nto teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that\nsays \"Smoke Pot, It's Fun.\"\nMR. MERTZ: I believe, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the school have to do\nthat?\nMR. MERTZ: I believe, Your Honor, that a\nnondisruptive pin, badge, whatever you want to call it,\nwould have to be tolerated. However, they would not\nhave to tolerate a student who interrupts a anti-drug\npresentation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the school, even though\nit is trying to teach one point of view, can allow\nstudents to come in and undermine that point of view,\nassuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of\nview? It can allow students to come in and undermine\nwhat it's trying to teach?\nMR. MERTZ: I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that is not disruption\nin your view?\nMR. MERTZ: I think they cannot prevent\npresentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is\ndone in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the\nschool's own presentation of its viewpoint.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can the student be allowed\nto wear a button that says \"Rape Is Fun\"?\nMR. MERTZ: No, I don't think so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?\nMR. MERTZ: There is a distinction there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?\nMR. MERTZ: Because when you're talking\nabout hate speech, speech that advocates violence, then\nyou're in another category of speech. There has been\ngeneral recognition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nonviolent crimes are okay,\nit's only violent crimes that you can't, you can not\npromote, right? Right?\nMR. MERTZ: I think there is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Extortion Is Profitable,\"\nthat's okay?\nMR. MERTZ: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a very, very, with\nall respect, ridiculous line. I mean, I can understand\nyou're saying you cannot promote things that are\nunlawful, but to say, oh, it's only violent, where do\nyou get that line from, only violent unlawful acts?\nMR. MERTZ: No, I'm not saying only violent\nunlawful acts. But this is a case where if you look at\nit in the context of what was going on in the State at\nthe time, where there was an active public debate on\nmarijuana policy, on marijuana for medical use,\nmarijuana for personal use, so it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's a political\n-- even assuming it's a political issue, the question is\nwhether the school has to say our classrooms, our field\ntrips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a\nforum for that debate?\nMR. MERTZ: I believe it does not have to if\nbeing a forum would disrupt the school's own educational\nprogram and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And disruption does\nnot include undermining the message they want to send?\nIt has to be some type of physical disruption. But\nundermining the message they want to send, they can't\nmake the judgment that that's not allowed?\nMR. MERTZ: Preventing a contrary viewpoint\nfrom being expressed, that we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but you rephrased it\nthat way, but what actually happened is the principal\nlooks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at\nwhat's supposed to be a school event with everybody\ntogether in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes\na joke out of drug use. The principal thinks of course\nadolescents and post-adolescents sometimes like to test\nlimits, and if the kids go around having 15-foot banners\nmaking a joke out of drug use that really does make it a\nlittle tougher for me to convince the students at this\nschool not to use drugs, and particularly putting up\n15-foot banners. I don't know why everybody wants to\nget away from that because I think you would have had a\nvery different case if in fact it had been a whisper or\nif it had been a serious effort to contest the drug\nlaws. It wasn't either. It was a joke. It was a\n15-foot banner. We have the message plus the means plus\nthe school event.\nNow, what's your response?\nMR. MERTZ: My response, Your Honor, is\nthat, first of all, a 14-foot banner.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's an excellent\nresponse, I think.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MERTZ: That was just a preliminary. In\nfact, what it was was a person displaying this banner in\na quiet, passive manner that didn't interfere with\nanybody's observation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I conceive that\ninterference consists of it's pretty hard to run a\nschool where kids go around at public events publicly\nmaking a joke out of drugs. That's what his thought is.\nNow, I don't think he has to be able to read content\ndiscrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place.\nHe doesn't know the law, the principal. His job is to\nrun the school. And so I guess what I'm worried about\nis a rule that would -- is on your side, a rule that\ntakes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing\nlimits all over the place in the high schools. But a\nrule that against your side may really limit people's\nrights on free speech. That's what I'm struggling with.\nNow, I want some help there and I'm worried about the\nprincipal.\nMR. MERTZ: I believe the answer is that the\nTinker case as we understand it struck a very wise\ncompromise between allowing school officials to have\ncomplete discretion to suppress student speech in order\nto maintain what they conceive of as their individual\nmission and the student's right to speak in a\nnondisruptive manner. The speaker -- the Tinker case\nhas stood the test of time for 40, almost 30 years and,\nalthough --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that, but\nthe subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on\nit. I mean, it stood the test of time in the sense that\nit hasn't been overruled, but --\nMR. MERTZ: There have been some narrow\nexceptions to it in subsequent cases, of course, the\nFrazier and the Kuhlmeier cases. But the basic, the\nheart of it, the requirement that the school demonstrate\nthat substantial disruption before it can engage in\nsuppression of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think we're using\ndisruption in two different senses here and we should\nprobably separate the two. One sense is disrupting the\nclass so that whatever is being taught can't be taught.\nBut you're also using it in the sense of undermining a\ngeneral message that the school is trying to get across:\nObey the law, don't use drugs, whatever. Maybe we\nshould have a different word for -- the first is\ndisruption. Disruption is a, is a funny word for the\nsecond. Let's called it undermining instead.\nNow, you think both of them, however, are\nbad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the\nspeech?\nMR. MERTZ: If I understand your question\ncorrectly, the second of them might better be called\nallowing competing viewpoints.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you think undermining is\nperfectly okay? You would never consider undermining to\nbe disruption and therefore bad?\nMR. MERTZ: I think undermining in the sense\nof preventing impeding the school from delivering its\nown message --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but only that.\nMR. MERTZ: -- would be substantial\ndisruption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right after a class on\ndrugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say:\nThis class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use\nthem all the time, I urge all of you. That's perfectly\nokay? That's not undermining?\nMR. MERTZ: I believe that is the kind of\nspeech --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not disruption?\nMR. MERTZ: -- that we must tolerate no\nmatter how unwise it is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't the school,\ncouldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner\nregulation that says you're not going to use the halls\nto proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?\nMR. MERTZ: I believe that's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You could have reasonable\nrules of decorum for what goes on inside the school\nbuilding.\nMR. MERTZ: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the school have\nto be completely neutral in that respect? Does it have\nto punish who says that was a good program, I'm not\ngoing to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because\nhe's taking position on a public issue?\nMR. MERTZ: I think a content neutral,\ncontent neutrality is critical here, and if the school\nwants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has\nan outside of the official forum --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does that\nnotion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I\nthought we wanted our schools to teach something,\nincluding something besides just basic elements,\nincluding the character formation and not to use drugs.\nThey have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs\nor not?\nMR. MERTZ: Content neutrality goes to what\nspeech is suppressed or punished. As far as the school\ndelivering its own message, there is no requirement of\nequal time or that it be neutral. It's got its own\nviewpoint in the case of drugs, a viewpoint that almost\nall of us agree with, and it should be able to espouse\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A school isn't an open\nforum. A school isn't there for everybody to teach the\nstudents whatever he wants. It's there for the teachers\nto instruct. And you're turning it into an open forum.\nIf the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else\nhas to be able to address that issue.\nMR. MERTZ: I don't believe that's the case\nat all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not my vision of\nwhat a school is.\nMR. MERTZ: In the classroom delivering the\nprescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the\nschool wishes to present a particular message, that's\none case. However, in the lunchroom, outside in recess,\nacross the street, that is a quintessentially open forum\nwhere it would not be proper, I think, to tell students\nyou may not mention this subject, you may not take this\nposition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you concede that\nthere was some right of school control for what was\ngoing on across the street?\nMR. MERTZ: No. Actually our primary\nposition on that is that he was in a public place at a\npublic event among public people --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If kids were throwing\nbottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no\nright or duty to go over there and stop it?\nMR. MERTZ: Oh, I think if they were\nengaging in an act of hooliganism --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the\nschool has a right of control.\nMR. MERTZ: There is a distinction here.\nThis young man had not been in school today, had not\nbeen an campus, was not in any class that was released\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did he go where\nhe went?\nMR. MERTZ: Pardon?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did he choose\nthat location to unfurl his banner?\nMR. MERTZ: He explained because it was the\nonly place where he actually knew the route of the\nrelay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, that's -- I\nhave, I guess his note, you accept this with what the\nteacher said. The entire class went to view the relay.\nIndividual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning.\nThey were not given the option of remaining in class,\nnor were they released to do as they pleased. They were\nto watch the relay with the rest of the student body,\neither just in front of the school or just across the\nstreet -- that's me, not them -- and then return\ndirectly to their classrooms, which I guess the school\ndid. So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand\ntogether, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the\nteachers will be there and take you back to class. Now\nis there something else in the record that suggests\nsomething different?\nMR. MERTZ: There is a major dispute on that\npoint, Your Honor. We presented several affidavits that\nshowed individual teachers --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just tell me where to look.\nWhere are the conflicting affidavits? I'm just reading\nfrom page 51 of the joint appendix. I didn't know there\nwas a dispute.\nMR. MERTZ: It would be on pages 32, 34, 36.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll look at those.\nAnother somewhat minor point. Can I ask you another\npoint about the record? I'll read those.\nMR. MERTZ: Okay. Can I finish the\ndescription of what actually happened? According to the\nstudents, for those who were released from class, there\nwas no requirement for staying on campus, and many of\nthem did not stay on campus. No requirement for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, they went across the\nstreet.\nMR. MERTZ: Some of them did. Some went\ndown --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there any -- there was\nno requirement, they didn't have to go across the street\nor stay on campus, they could wander off distantly.\nMR. MERTZ: They could, and many of them\ndid.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. MERTZ: And there was no requirement\nthat they stay together, no requirement that they do\nanything in particular. They --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I had to watch -- not even\nwatch the parade, no requirement they watch the parade?\nThey were released in order to watch the parade.\nMR. MERTZ: That was the intent, obviously,\nfor those released.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The intent, it was the\ndirection.\nMR. MERTZ: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was not only the intent,\nit was the direction.\nMR. MERTZ: Actually it was not. According\nto these student affidavits, they were simply released\nand said, you can go watch --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any fact\nfinding on that? You referred to affidavits.\nMR. MERTZ: No. It was decided on cross\nmotions for summary judgment in the district court, and\nthere were no findings, actually no factual findings at\nall, and certainly nothing on that particular point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you another\nrecord point, just so I know where to look?\nMR. MERTZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You've also asked for an\ninjunction that would require expunging his 5-day\nsuspension from his record.\nMR. MERTZ: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: 10 days. Well, 10 or 5,\nunclear. I noticed the superintendent of schools on\npage 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is,\n\"Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable\nbecause he was exercising his free of speech right.\nEven if I were to concede his speech across from the\nhigh school is protected, which I do not, the rest of\nhis behavior warranted the suspension.\" And then he\nsays, \"And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. So given\nthat, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you --\nthat it is protected and so forth -- then would you\nconcede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's\nover, it still stands, I don't care about the\nexpungement or not?\nMR. MERTZ: The -- whether it remains on the\nrecord, anything that remains on his record is obviously\nmuch more --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but I'm asking that you\nthink about it. I'm putting you on the spot.\nMR. MERTZ: In that case, I missed the point\nof your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know what the\nsuperintendent said. As I read it is, he says, look, I\ndon't care if this was protected or not. I'll give you\nthat. It's protected. But the rest of his behavior,\nthe way he treated the principal, what he did, the\nreluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a\nsuspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.\nSo it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is\nsaying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5\ndays. That's what the superintendent says.\nNow suppose you win your point that you're\ninterested in winning, which you may not or you may.\nAre you still then going to pursue this case on the 5\ndays, that that should be erased?\nMR. MERTZ: If the only thing left were\ndiscipline because he was tardy that day, was -- didn't\ndivulge the names of the other people holding the\nbanner, that sort of thing, we couldn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You couldn't what? I\ndidn't hear the last part of what you said. You just\ngot to the point of --\nMR. MERTZ: Of answering the question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What's the answer?\nMR. MERTZ: Those things wouldn't manner\nanymore.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you would not pursue it?\nMR. MERTZ: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can we get back --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can we get back to\nwhat the case is about. You think the law was so\nclearly established when this happened that the\nprincipal, that the instant that the banner was\nunfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is\ncoming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I\ncan only take the sign down if it's disruptive. But\nthen under Frazier I can do something if it interferes\nwith the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got\nthis other thing. So she should have known at that\npoint that she could not take the banner down, and it\nwas so clear that she should have to pay out of her own\npocket because of it.\nMR. MERTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, there are two\ndifferent time points we have to talk about. There's\nthe heat of the moment out there on the street, but then\nlater back in the office when she actually decided to\nlevy the punishment after she had talked to him, after\nshe heard why he did it and why he didn't do it, after\nshe had had a chance to consult with the school\ndistrict's counsel. At that point in the calmness of\nher office, then she should indeed have known it. And\nshe did testify that she had taken a master's degree\ncourse in school law in which she studied Kuhlmeier and\nFrazier and Tinker. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so it should be\nperfectly clear to her exactly what she could and\ncouldn't do.\nMR. MERTZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As it is to us, right?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we have had a\ndebate here for going on 50 minutes about what Tinker\nmeans, about the proper characterization of the\nbehavior, the nonspeech behavior. The school's terms in\ndealing with the kids that morning. The meaning of the,\nof the statement. We've been debating this in this\ncourtroom for going on an hour, and it seems to me\nhowever you come out, there is reasonable debate.\nShould the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm\ndeliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the\ncorrect answer is?\nMR. MERTZ: We believe at the very least she\nshould have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive\nholding of a sign because it said something you\ndisagreed with.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course I disagree with\nthe characterization on disruptive. It was completely\ndisruptive of the message, of the theme that the school\nwanted to promote. Completely disruptive of the reason\nfor letting the students out to begin with. Completely\ndisruptive of the school's image that they wanted to\nportray in sponsoring the Olympics.\nMR. MERTZ: Well, they weren't sponsoring\nthe Olympics, they weren't even sponsoring this event\nactually. They simply let the students out to watch it.\nThat was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Some of the students were\ncarrying the torch and the band was playing in the\nparade.\nMR. MERTZ: A few of the student -- a few of\nthe relay runners were from the school and had been\nallowed to skip school because of that, and the pep band\nplayed as it went by. I do not believe that made the\ntorch relay a school event. The best that can be said\nfor them is that they let the students watch it with the\nconcurrence of individual teachers, and that that\nattendance was a school sanctioned attendance. Now\nwhether that allows them to then engage in this kind of\npunishment for speech by a student who was not even\namong those released, who is standing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now you said that in your\nbrief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got\nmileage out of his being truant that morning. Would the\ncase have come out differently, would you be making any\ndifferent argument if he got to school on time and was\nreleased with the rest of them? Does the case turn on\nthe fact that he was late to school that day?\nMR. MERTZ: We believe it would be a closer\nquestion, but the fact that he was not there in school\ntoday, and intentionally was not there today, turns this\ninto a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in\na public place in a public event who was not acting as a\nstudent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So he's not a school\nchild, he would be playing hooky?\nMR. MERTZ: Because he was playing hooky\nbecause he chose not to be there, because he was not\npart of the class.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the law\nrequired him to be there?\nMR. MERTZ: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He wasn't playing hooky.\nHe showed up late, that's all, right? I mean, he\nactually came and joined his classmates at an event that\nhe knew was an event that the school told the classes to\ngo to.\nMR. MERTZ: He joined --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As far as I'm concerned, he\njust showed up late.\nMR. MERTZ: He joined a public crowd on a\nprivate side -- public sidewalk in front of private\nhomes. The crowd happened to have some other students\nin that school there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did he go\nimmediately after? He went to the school building for\nwhatever it was, the third period of the day.\nMR. MERTZ: Yes. The principal instructed\nhim to do so and he did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So under your view, if the\nprincipal sees something wrong in the crowd across the\nstreet, had to come up and say now, how many here are\ntruants and how many here are -- I can't discipline you\nbecause you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the\nbottle.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MERTZ: No, I don't think she needs to\ndo that in the heat of the moment. But later on once\nshe's discovered the true facts, then at that point I\nthink she loses a basis for punishing him as a student\nif he was not there as a student.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because you're both a\ntruant and disrupter, you get off.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Had you been just a\ndisrupter, tough luck.\nMR. MERTZ: Well, it may well be that he\ncould have been punished for being truant, but of course\nthat's not why we're here. He was punished for\ndisplaying, for the content of the sign he was\ndisplaying in a public place as a private citizen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who were the people that\nhelped him hold up his flag? Were they not classmates\nof his?\nMR. MERTZ: Most of them were classmates; at\nleast one was not a student.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did he not know that these\nclassmates were there at a public event that was\nsponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had\ndirected the students to go?\nMR. MERTZ: I'm sure he did know.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it seems to me it's like\njoining a school trip at the zoo, you know. You -- you\ndon't make it to the -- to the school, but you drive\nthere yourself and then join the class as it's going\nthrough the zoo. It seems to me he's in school.\nMR. MERTZ: A better analogy might be if he\nhad gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in\nsome expressive act, and there happened to be a school\ngroup there at the same time, could the teacher with\nthat group then have disciplined him for what he was\ndoing?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets back to\nthe point I was trying to make earlier. He came here\nbecause it was the school event, the school sponsored\nactivity. He could have gone anywhere along the route.\nHe knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that\nthey were going to be, the students were going to be\nreleased to see it. He went to join up with the school\neven if he were truant that day.\nMR. MERTZ: No, Your Honor. I believe\nthat's incorrect. There is nothing in the record that\neven suggests that he went there in order to join up\nwith schoolmates or in order to be near the school. He\nsays, in fact, he intentionally tried to avoid the\nschool because he thought that that way he could avoid\nthe school jurisdiction for his --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think he could have\nbeen marked absent for the whole day because he didn't\nintend to be part of the school group afterwards? I\nmean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a\nday truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy.\nAnd he shows up and he says, oh, you can't -- you have\nto hold me for a whole day's truancy because I didn't\nintend to be in school. I was in school but I didn't\nintend to be there.\nMR. MERTZ: I think it would all depend on\nwhether he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make any sense\nto me. Does it depend on his intent, whether or not he\nintended to be a truant that afternoon?\nMR. MERTZ: I think that would depend on the\nfact of whether he was a truant that afternoon.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He was either in school or\nhe wasn't in school.\nMR. MERTZ: In the morning he wasn't in\nschool.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the afternoon he either\nwas or he wasn't.\nMR. MERTZ: In the afternoon he was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the question is whether\njoining the school group, intentionally joining the\nschool group, going there because the school group was\nthere, whether that places him in school.\nMR. MERTZ: As a hypothetical, if he were\nintentionally joining a school group, I would have to\nsay that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the\nschool has.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why does it matter? That\nis, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the\nprincipal and why wouldn't the issue be what that\nprincipal really reasonably thought the situation was?\nI mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of\nthe school group, if the principal reasonably thought\nthat this was a school outing, if the principal\nreasonably thought that students are staying together,\nwhy wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take\nthe case, we should take it that way, because the\nprincipal reasonably thinks?\nMR. MERTZ: As far as qualified immunity, I\nthink that's correct, if she had a reasonable belief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But even on the merits?\nMR. MERTZ: On the merits I don't think so,\nbecause if he was not in fact there as part of a school\ngroup --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even if the principal\ncouldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she\nthought he was part of the school group reasonably, if\nhe really wasn't?\nMR. MERTZ: I do not believe there's\nanything in the law that allows a principal to convert a\npure free speech exercise into a school exercise because\nit's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were going to\nappeal to the calm of her office the next day. I\nthought that was going to be your answer to my question.\nWhatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it\nlater.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask to you clarify\none thing. I initiated this line of questioning when I\nsaid I was surprised that your brief made such a big\ndeal that he was late to school. You would still be\nmaking the argument about the free speech right if he\nhad diligently showed up for his math class first period\nin the morning, gone out with the others, and had his\nbanner to unfurl when the torch came by?\nMR. MERTZ: That is correct. We have two\nindependent bases for defending him here. One is the\npure free speech in a public place argument. That's the\none that hinges on the fact that he was not among the\nreleased students. The other argument, which we believe\nin equally, is that even if it were a on-campus or on an\nextension of campus like a field trip, then under Tinker\nbecause it was not disruptive they cannot punish it.\nMy time is up. I thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Mertz.\nMr. Starr, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. STARR: For the reasons that have been\ndiscussed, under no circumstances should Deborah Morse,\na conscientious principal, be subjected to the\npossibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages.\nA very brief factual point. In light of the\nrichness of the discussion with respect to the facts, I\nwould guide the Court to page 109 of the joint appendix.\nThis is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there\nshe sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law.\nTo promote drugs -- and this is our\nfundamental suggestion and submission. To promote drugs\nis utterly inconsistent with the basic educational\nmission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to\nthe contrary would really be quite inconsistent with\nmuch of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls. The\nopinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially\npowerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their\ndangers.\nMore broadly, the Court does not need to go\nmore broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with\nrespect to the need to defer to school officials in\nidentifying the educational mission. But we know that\nthere are in fact constitutional limits. Those limits\nare captured in Tinker. A passive pure political speech\nthat reflects on the part of the school board a\nstandardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of\ncontroversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy\nover the classroom. We are light years away from that.\nI thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel,\nthe case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was
