CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams.
Ms. Brenan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BRENAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A fairly presented claim has been
adjudicated on the merits when a state court issues a
decision denying relief unless it has made a plain
statement to the contrary. And this is especially true
where the state court has grappled with the substance of
the alleged error.
And this rule is correct for three reasons:
First, state courts discharge their duties.
They are sworn to uphold the Constitution. Therefore,
they must adjudicate claims that can -- that allege
constitutional violations. So when a state court issues
a decision denying relief, it must necessarily have
considered and rejected all of the claims.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens when there
is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state
law ground on -- on a Confrontation Clause ground, and
all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary
rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation
Clause is based on a different theory?
Are we to assume, in the light of that kind
of decision, that the court actually grappled with the
Confrontation Clause?
MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, we would assume
that there the state court, through its denial of
relief, did adjudicate the presented Confrontation
Clause -- claim. And that would be because --
for a number of reasons.
First, the presumption of regularity that
judicial officers do do their job, and it can only be
rebutted by clear evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I to make that
assumption when, before our line of cases in this area,
state courts generally had held that if hearsay was
admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was
the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge?
Is a Federal court supposed to continue with
that presumption in light of an undisputed state's
statement that their rules are consonant with the
Confrontation Clause.
MS. BRENAN: In that situation, if the state
court rule is consonant with the Confrontation Clause,
we would have certainly an adjudication of the
Confrontation Clause.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's assume it's
not after our -- we render our decision.
MS. BRENAN: And if it were -- if it were
different, we would still hold that in that situation,
as this Court -- in relying on Richter, in that
situation it would be more of a summary denial on the
confrontation analysis.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If one --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we can continue and
probably should talk about this broad theory that you
want us to adopt.
Really, in this case, the court of appeals
in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in
turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a
Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation,
you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the
Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes. And it seems to me
it's very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal
Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood.
So it seems to me that you're -- you have a
very strong argument that they did adjudicate the
Federal claim anyway. I know you want us to maybe reach
the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays
it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the
argument, that you don't strongly make, although you
don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the
state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the
Federal standard was the basis for the entire
jurisprudence.
MS. BRENAN: Yes, Your Honor, we agree that
in our situation it just so happened to be that the
state standard also encompassed this Court's Sixth
Amendment jurisprudence because it -- it was citing U.S.
v. Wood, and it was citing Smith v. Phillips among the
-- the Sixth Amendment cases. In our case, it just so
happens that it does.
But we posit also that our case shows why
this is illustrative as to why this Court should adopt
the broader rule that, in situations where a state court
has denied relief or a claim has been fairly presented,
that this Court and all Federal courts should assume
that the state courts did their job by adjudicating
claims --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Irrebuttably?
MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, in -- we have
suggested that -- that it can be rebutted by a plain
statement, if the state court says that it is not
reaching it or, more particularly, if a state court
imposes a procedural bar.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see exceptions to that
already. There are cases where the state court reaches
one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go
to the second.
MS. BRENAN: Yes --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you really can't say
in that situation that you can assume they reached the
second, can you?
MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, I posit that
those Strickland cases are different. And they are
different because in all of those cases of Wiggins v.
Smith and Rompilla, that there the courts -- what the
State court did was follow exactly what this Court has
said of how a Strickland claim may be answered entirely
by only addressing the one prong of Strickland.
And so there they're doing exactly
adjudicating everything through the analysis of one.
Additionally, in those cases, by doing so,
the courts are not in any way suggesting that the State
courts failed to do something.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brenan, we are
straying pretty far from this case. And correct me if
I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was
made under State law, and then Williams said there was
an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the
Sixth Amendment was violated.
So there really isn't any
independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent
Sixth Amendment right. It's State law was violated and
therefore the Constitution was violated.
So it seems to me if we just look at the
position that Williams was taking, that these two, the
State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together.
And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some
other case that might come before us some day would not
be wise.
MS. BRENAN: Yes, Your Honor, I completely
agree with the view that here Williams did present a
completely dependent Federal claim; and, therefore, the
State's analysis -- the State court's analysis would
have fully adjudicated that.
However, we suggest that this case does
illustrate why that broader rule is important. And it's
important because, otherwise, other Federal courts may
not view it as this Court did, of seeing it as a dependent
claim --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the court of
appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the
Respondent to present a separate State claim and a
separate Federal claim, correct?
MS. BRENAN: Exactly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the predicate
to the whole question we have before us, right?
MS. BRENAN: Exactly, Your Honor.
So --
JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you this
hypothetical. The brief filed with an intermediate
State court of appeals contains 25 pages of argument on
a Federal constitutional claim. Let's say it's a Brady
claim. And then it also has two other claims, two other
arguments. They are State law claims, and each one is
dealt with in two pages. And then the State court,
intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that
addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing
about the Federal constitutional claim.
You would say there that -- that it's
conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal
constitutional claim?
MS. BRENAN: Yes, Your Honor, in that
situation we would. One, because of the presumption of
regularity; two, because of what this Court has said in
Richter, where we could view it as a summary denial;
and, third, what underlies that is ­ is the view that
if it's not written in the opinion, that it has been ignored.
But that's not what this Court said in
Castillo, where it said, if a court chooses to ignore in
its opinion, which should be read as in its opinion
writing, means that that claim has been impliedly
rejected.
So, therefore, just because a State court
chooses not to write about it in its opinion does not
mean that it didn't consider and reject that claim.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it necessary to go so
far as to require a plain statement? Why wouldn't you
protect the same interests if you had a rule that said
that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated
the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if
there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a
very strong inference that they overlooked it.
Then you wouldn't have situations like the
one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or
the one that I just mentioned to you.
MS. BRENAN: Sure, Your Honor, but the
reason why there should be a plain statement is because
it's long been held that in order to rebut that
presumption of regularity, you need clear evidence.
And, really, the only clear evidence that one could have
would be a plain statement.
And this Court reinforced that when it said
in Richter, it talked about an indication or other State
procedural bars, and it cited Harris v. Reed. And
Harris v. Reed is a case that talked about plain
statements.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that in --
in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue
for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was
enough indication that the court did not consider it or
not, right? And every year is a reduction of sentence,
so to speak.
MS. BRENAN: Exactly, Your Honor. And
that's -- that's why having a broader rule with this
presumption --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- I
suppose the broader rule, if you took $28.52 out of the
State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp
which just says, we have considered and rejected all
constitutional claims, then there would be no problem?
MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, they really do that
when they say "affirmed" at the end of the decision. It
really adds nothing.
If it were a stamp, it would be merely
reflexive, and therefore would in the end give you no
indication whether an argument had been considered or
not.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any idea based on
your experience how many separate claims are typically
raised in a capital case of this sort?
MS. BRENAN: If -- this was not a capital
case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.
MS. BRENAN: -- but an LWOP case. However,
in a capital case there can be hundreds. And we -- or
hundreds of pages of documents -- or hundreds of pages
in an appellant's opening brief, and, therefore, if one
were to slip in, in a phrase an apparent claim, and that
the State court happens not to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: There would be a lot of
good debate over whether it was presented clearly
enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to
require the court to answer it. I can see a whole --
you know, a whole train of litigation on this wonderful
subject, a whole new area of law. Has the -- has the
State supreme court overlooked something that was
clearly enough presented, and is there enough indication
that the State court has overlooked it? I mean --
that's the problem.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of the circuit
courts basically have a rule close to the one announced
by Justice Alito, don't they?
MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, if they happen not
to mention one particular claim?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of them have
essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form
of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this
circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable
presumption.
I'm sorry. Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh.
MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor -- the
Eleventh Circuit and, I believe that, the Sixth Circuit as
well.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not as absolute
as the Eleventh.
MS. BRENAN: True that the Eleventh Circuit
has a broader rule. And we believe --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a -- you know, I
mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception
that abuses it. It's the nature of human nature.
Do you know what the total number of habeas
petitions there are and what the percentage that are
actually granted?
MS. BRENAN: I don't have that figure off
the top of my head, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you be willing to
accept that it's -- in relationship to the total
granted, it's very, very small?
MS. BRENAN: Yes, I believe that is true,
that there is a small number of granting of petitions,
yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So whatever the abuse of
the system is, it hasn't halted justice.
MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, the thing is
that -- and I think that Justice Scalia has adverted to
this -- is that if we were to -- to require only an
indication, it would create a situation where there
would be all this litigation. And that's why this
Court, when it does -- has accepted conclusive
presumptions in other cases, for example in Coleman v.
Thompson, talked about we will accept these conclusive
presumptions because they work in almost all of the
cases, and we will accept the small number of errors in
exchange for the reduction workload. So --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why can't they just
do what we used to do? Many district judges do this
and -- because there sometimes thousands of
petitions of different kinds. A lot go to the staff
attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments,
and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side:
Any other arguments that are made are rejected. All
right.
Now, that serves one purpose. A human being
has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking: I've
looked this over pretty carefully. And if it's a staff
attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't
want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he
or she has really looked with some care.
And so it serves a purpose. It means they
don't do it just as a form. They could turn it into a
form, but they shouldn't. And so if -- let them write
that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into
play these presumptions, et cetera.
MS. BRENAN: Justice Breyer, I would
disagree with -- with that proposal because it is in the
end just -- could become reflexive --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, anything. Judges can
not do their job. But -- but when you write something
like the word "denied," which is all most district
judges write in respect to many motions, they read the
motion, they think about it, that's their job.
So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a
judge who is going to have to write certain words will
want to do his job or her job, and they will do it.
So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that
isn't a big deal.
Now, this case, they didn't write that for
some reason. Many do.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the -- doesn't the
word denied at the end of the order say the same thing?
We've considered --
JUSTICE BREYER: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- all of the points made,
and we have denied them.
And wouldn't it be the case that if you
require such a statement, but you have a situation where
a Federal question occupies 90 percent of the brief, and
the court only addresses explicitly the state things,
the state claims, and then at the very end says, we have
considered all the other claims, presumably including
the 90 percent Federal claims that are not addressed,
would we be out of the woods, or would you be here again
arguing the same problem?
MS. BRENAN: I think we could be arguing the
same problem. I think, as Your Honor's noted, that the
inclusion of the word denied, or, if you're affirming a
conviction in a direct appeal, the word affirmed covers
that. It says exactly, we have considered all those
other claims.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Brenan, can I ask you
what you mean by a plain statement? Because you've said
a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary.
Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have
given you hypotheticals, very different from this case,
but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong
inference that there was no adjudication of the
particular Federal claim alleged.
You said that's not a plain statement, even
though it seems as though there is a strong inference.
So what would be a plain statement?
MS. BRENAN: A plain statement would be a
procedural bar, or if there were -- a court were to say,
we're not, for some reason, going the reach the
constitutional claim, that they really need to say it
out loud. I don't know why they would say that, but
that's what would be required.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I don't know why they
would say that either. Well, by the way, we're not
adjudicating this, you know. So if that's your test,
your test is an irrebuttable presumption.
MS. BRENAN: No, Your Honor, I would
disagree, because there is the possibility of having --
having the procedural bar.
JUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if the
brief raises five arguments, and the opinion says the
appellant has raised four arguments, is that a plain
statement that the fifth -- the fifth argument was
overlooked?
MS. BRENAN: I would say that it possibly
could be if it were in that situation. However, I
would -- I would still go back to -- to really, the
Richter presumption of saying that that word at the end,
denied, denied is denied is denied, and it covers every
fairly presented claim.
JUSTICE ALITO: That's not a plain
statement? What if there is one Federal claim -- one
Federal argument and five state arguments, and the
opinion says, this appeal raises only issues of state
law, is that a plain statement?
MS. BRENAN: Possibly it could be,
Your Honor, but here we don't -- we don't have that
situation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you about the
underlying claim here? It is quite troublesome. I
think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen
charge; is that right?
MS. BRENAN: Correct. Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the possibility of
getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this
way is -- is really troublesome.
The judge can't give an Allen charge to urge
the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the
judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss
that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome.
MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, the thing is
that here we have a trial court who is looking at this
juror and makes the determination that the juror is
biased. And, therefore, if there was to be anything of
any sort of constitutional violation, it would be to
keeping that juror, a biased juror, on the jury. That
would be a violation of the Sixth Amendment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I have to -- I mean,
this takes us into the merits, which is really
interesting, but I -- we probably shouldn't go there,
but, as long as we're there for a minute, I agree with
Justice Ginsburg. I've never seen a procedure like
this.
And I looked -- I looked at this -- the
Federal cases, Brown and Thomas, that the Cleveland
court cited. Those -- and Wood was voir dire, was not
mid-jury.
I just hope this doesn't happen with much
regularity. And the fact that the trial judge is upset,
that's the reason that you should leave the jury alone,
it seems to me. I think it's very troublesome.
MS. BRENAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a
situation where, through the voir dire, what comes out
is not that we're trying to get -- that the trial judge
is feeling to get rid of this juror because he's the
hold-out juror, but it's because through the voir dire
he determines that this juror is biased, and that is the
bias, and that's what makes it different.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That the person is not
guilty is a bias?
MS. BRENAN: No, Your Honor, that's
certainly not it. It's the bias comes from what he was
saying of his disagreement or -- that he just really did
not believe with the felony murder rule. Therefore,
it's that -- that under any evidence, whatever evidence
was presented, that he would not be able to convict
because he disagreed with the very basis of the law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's -- that
may be your strongest point, but most of what he said
was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence
has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has
to be clear enough for me to be convinced. Is that a
biased juror?
MS. BRENAN: That is not a biased juror, but
that's what he said to the court.
But what comes out through the voir dire of
the other jurors is not that he was using a reasonable
doubt standard, but that he was using a no doubt
standard, an absolute doubt standard.
And that's where he's not following the law,
and that's where he's biased. And that's where he
becomes a biased juror who has no right to be on that
jury.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I must say that, like
Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges
intrude in the deliberative processes of juries.
Most of the time when we're assessing bias,
we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous
evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire
and is now either a convicted felon or introduced
extraneous circumstance.
But the degree of being convinced is the
very essence of jury deliberations. This case is
troublesome.
MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, I believe in
this situation it's one where the judge was presented
with possible misconduct, and therefore had to do
something. Had the judge done nothing, we could have
possibly been in the same situation.
And under -- under California law, it's
where this -- this examination cannot be so intrusive.
So we maintain that it was not. It was only
to the degree in which we are finding that there was a
biased juror. At that point in time, the Sixth
Amendment required that that juror be removed.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I go back, Ms. Brenan,
to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I
understand what you're arguing now.
In your brief, you talked about focusing on
the error. So if evidence was admitted, you would say
it doesn't matter that there were three different
theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong;
you should just look at the fact that we're talking
about the admission of evidence. Now, is -- is that
what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the
states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you
know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and
one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel,
you would still apply the same rule?
MS. BRENAN: What we're saying is that, at
the very least, in our type of situation where -- where
the court discusses the alleged error, there is an
adjudication on the merits, but that plays into the
larger and broader rule.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why does your theory
make any sense? I mean, we're supposed to be
interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim
was adjudicated on the merits. Usually when we speak of
claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief. We don't
look at a claim and say, we'll just check, you know,
what -- we don't use an operative facts test, and you
seem to be suggesting that that's the kind of test we
should use.
MS. BRENAN: Yes, in -- especially if you're
going to look at the state courts, which are -- must
decide both the Federal and state questions. So their
interpretation of what a claim is does not necessarily
mean what it eventually becomes when it's in Federal
habeas.
And the Federal habeas courts are limited by
their jurisdiction to only be Federal law theories, and
a Federal petitioner can only bring such claims.
So, for that reason, it's -- it's not the
good fit for the state courts to limit them in that way.
And that's why we're saying, at least in a situation
where a state court has grappled with the substance of
the error, that it has adjudicated the claim, which it
could have viewed, as was here, sort of a single claim
independent, or it could have state law theories and
Federal law theories that it puts together.
And I would like to reserve the remainder of
my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hermansen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KURT D. HERMANSEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HERMANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The rule this Court should adopt is the same
rule that the consensus -- the consensus rule of the
courts of appeals. When they look at an opinion, a
reasoned opinion, they look at what the opinion says,
the text of the opinion. And if the opinion grapples
with the bulk of the claims that are in the prisoner's
appellate brief but omits to address one of the claims,
then there is an inference that the claim has not been
adjudicated on the merits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just the way
you phrased it, if it addresses the bulk of the claims,
under your theory it has to address every claim,
correct?
MR. HERMANSEN: If -- under my theory, if
there is a Federal claim that's overlooked or omitted,
then the inference --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Not
overlooked or omitted. Not discussed.
MR. HERMANSEN: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not analyzed in the
opinion.
MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. Here it's Sixth
Amendment, so the Sixth Amendment was not mentioned.
The Sixth Amendment was not -- there is no indication
from the opinion itself that the Sixth Amendment claim
was adjudicated.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that if --
if this was raised when your friend was at the
lectern -- if the court at the end said, not only
denied, but said, I considered all other arguments not
addressed, denied, then you have no case, correct?
MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. And that's the
recommendation of the NACDL brief. Is that, and we do see
that a lot. There is -- where there are opinions that say:
We've reviewed and considered all claims raised and
reject them.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would mean that if
you prevail it would just become routine. Justice
Kennedy mentioned the stamp that says: We considered
all of the questions raised, those not discussed on the
merits --
MR. HERMANSEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as
Justice Breyer was saying, we, and as my friend was
arguing, you know, there is regularity and we do -- it's
fair to assume that a judge who is looking at an
appellate court brief is going to do their job and look
at the briefs. So that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're not
willing to assume that when the judge says "denied."
You're willing to assume that when the judge says: I've
looked at everything, denied.
MR. HERMANSEN: Right --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me if
you give them the presumption of regularity in the one
case you ought to give it to them in the other.
MR. HERMANSEN: And I don't think the
presumption of regularity should apply here, just as
this Court in Smith v. Digmon looked at the opinion and
looked at what was argued and said: All the courts
below made a mistake; it was fairly exhausted.
And I would like to address Justice Scalia's
concern about the whole area of litigation that might
occur. That won't happen for one reason: In the habeas
context the claim must be fairly presented, period. If
the Federal constitutional claim is not fairly
presented, you're not in Federal court. And so there is
already a whole body of law talking about what a claim
is.
And my friend tries to avoid the word
"claim" because it's inconvenient.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it fairly presented
here?
MR. HERMANSEN: It was fairly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Given that the argument
was abuse of discretion?
MR. HERMANSEN: It was -- yes, Justice
Ginsburg, it was fairly presented. And in the red brief
at page 39 I talk about that, and also at page 43 of the
red brief I indicate that the attorney general conceded
that the claim was exhausted.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, again this is
fact-specific to the case. It doesn't address the rule
that we want to address and was the reason for us taking
the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate
court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it
also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit
court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment.
It seems to me that the Federal
constitutional claim was intertwined with and -- and
controlling of the procedural matters that the court
discussed. I just don't see the case is here even on
your theory.
MR. HERMANSEN: Justice Kennedy, I'm glad
you brought that up because I do want to address your
concern on that, and it's Dye -- this Court's opinion in
Dye takes care of the intertwined argument. In Dye this
Court said that as long as the claim, the Federal nature
of the claim is presented, even if it's presented under
the same heading, it's fairly presented on a habeas
claim.
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but that's the state
court. Here didn't -- would you disagree that the
California Supreme Court in Cleveland correctly or
incorrectly adopted a rule that it believed was
consistent with the Federal Constitution?
MR. HERMANSEN: If that were the case, then
we would have a different case. But in Cleveland, the
California Supreme Court explicitly rejected or declined
to adopt the Brown, Symington, Thomas --
JUSTICE ALITO: And were they under any
obligation to agree with Federal courts of appeal as to
the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment?
MR. HERMANSEN: They were not.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they -- isn't the --
isn't the reasonable reading of Cleveland that we're
adopting this rule, this is our State rule, it's based
on a very broadly worded State statute, it is informed
by our understanding of the Sixth Amendment, and we
disagree. We mention the Federal courts of appeals
decisions on this issue and we respectfully disagree
with their interpretation of the Sixth Amendment.
MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. So if the -- if
Cleveland were to come before this Court, then there
would be a clear indication from the opinion that they
had considered the Federal standard, but didn't adopt
it.
JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't the -- I'm sorry.
MR. HERMANSEN: But this case isn't
Cleveland. In this case what happened was --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you can
say that. I mean, I think the simplest statement of the
State rule is that the State believes that if you remove
a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the
Sixth Amendment. They said it in Cleveland. They were
presented with the argument in this case by the briefing
that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth
Amendment was violated. And they ruled to say he was
biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that
they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated
because he was biased.
MR. HERMANSEN: There -- the problem with
that determination is that there's the Federal standard
on what is -- what the Sixth Amendment standard is. So
under Thomas, Symington and Brown --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different
question. That question is whether the California
Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that
a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the
removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth
Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of
Supreme Court precedent, not circuit court precedent?
MR. HERMANSEN: This gets to the -- my
friend's argument about how their argument is upside
down. They are saying that we're trying to incorporate
into 2254(d)(1) what is contrary to and what is the
United States Supreme Court law, but we never get to
(d)(1)'s United States Supreme Court law limitation
because, looking at the text of 2254(d), you start with
was the claim adjudicated on the merits? That's the
threshold question.
So if the claim was not adjudicated on the
merits you don't get to the United States Supreme Court
law limitation. Instead --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
MR. HERMANSEN: Instead you look at Brown,
Thomas, and Symington, and they say that if the juror's
views on the merits of the case have been expressed and
the juror might be kicked off because of -- which is
exactly what happened here -- kicked off because of his
views on the case, then the Sixth Amendment has been
violated.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What Supreme Court
precedent commands that result?
MR. HERMANSEN: Supreme Court precedent
doesn't command it, but because it's de novo review and
because -- because it's a quid pro quo. 2254(d),
Congress said States are going to get deference and they
are going to get a limitation on the law that the
Federal courts can look at, the United States Supreme
Court law. But for that quid pro quo to happen, for the
States to get that deference and limitation on the law,
they have to have adjudicated the claim. Because
that's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, the --
MR. HERMANSEN: -- the main event is
supposed to be in State court. That is where the bite
of the apple is supposed to be, in State court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The discussion
you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice
Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is
that the court is going to have to decide in every case
whether or not State law is coterminous with Federal
law. And there was -- I don't know that the Ninth
Circuit got that question right in this case or they got
it wrong, but in every case, or many of the cases, the
claim will be made on the part of the State, well, yes,
they just said State law, but it's the same as Federal
law. And the Ninth Circuit recognized that as an
exception to their rule. Isn't that really going to
cause all sorts of collateral litigation?
MR. HERMANSEN: And it's not because this is
the rare case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry?
MR. HERMANSEN: I'm sorry. It's not, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it's not.
MR. HERMANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, this case
is a rare case where, looking at the opinion, we can't
tell if they adjudicated the claim on the merits. And
it appears, every appearance and inference is that they
overlooked it or didn't adjudicate it. So that's a rare
case. Normally, just looking at the opinion you can
tell if they adjudicated the Federal claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except in a case
like Harrington v. Richter.
MR. HERMANSEN: Harrington v. Richter
created a very simple, straightforward, and appropriate
presumption, because when you have a unexplained order
it makes sense that, in that context, that they have
adjudicated everything on the merits. And to give the
greatest respect to the State courts in comity and
federalism is to look at what the order says, and if
it's a reasoned opinion to take it at face value. It
says what it says; it doesn't say what it doesn't say.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I may be just
repeating some of my colleagues here, but I think if you
take this opinion at face value, it cuts against you. I
mean, it's a -- they're applying Cleveland. Cleveland
is a constitutional decision. It's a Federal
constitutional decision.
The concurrence makes that completely clear.
California has made it completely clear in other cases
post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth
Amendment.
Whether it's applying a correct
interpretation of the Sixth Amendment is unclear, but
it's also completely irrelevant. It thinks it's
applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a
Constitutional judgment, isn't it?
MR. HERMANSEN: No, Your Honor.
Cleveland -- a careful reading of Cleveland shows that
the majority does not adopt the Federal standard. So
the consensus standard in the -- in the Federal circuit
courts is that if the merits of --
JUSTICE KAGAN: You're quite right, it does
not adopt the consensus standard. It specifically
rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do
that. As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision
that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different
view of the Sixth Amendment. I'm just repeating what
Justice Alito here said.
And that's what it's doing. It's saying,
we're applying the Sixth Amendment, we're applying it
differently from the way these other courts have done so
because we think they're wrong.
MR. HERMANSEN: And so two points on that.
First, is the concurrent chides the majority for not
being concerned about the Sixth Amendment.
The second is the -- my friend cites People
v. Allen with an ellipse and doesn't give the full
context of Allen. So when they cite more recent law,
2006, that talks about how the demonstrable reality
test, which is just a notch up above substantial
evidence, is designed to protect constitutional rights
of due process and Sixth Amendment, what they don't say
is in People v. Allen, they only reached the statutory
issue, they never reached the constitutional issue. So,
at most, it's dicta.
And the California Supreme Court has never
held -- has never addressed the issue of when is the
Sixth Amendment violated when a juror is kicked off in
this fashion? And instead, they -- their role is we
allow free intrusion into the deliberative process. We
don't adopt Symington and Brown and Thomas when they say
that -- when a juror's views on the merits of the case,
questioning should stop. Instead, we think
that questioning should -- should be free to continue.
JUSTICE ALITO: The -- section 1089 is very
broadly worded; isn't that right? The section that was
being interpreted in Cleveland?
MR. HERMANSEN: Section 1089 -- I don't --
JUSTICE ALITO: All right. You think that
the California Supreme Court said, we're announcing a
rule of state law, and, you know, we've been told that
this rule is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment, but
we don't care, and we're not even -- we're not going to
worry about what the Sixth Amendment requires, we're
just going to adopt this rule as state law; do you think
that's what they did?
MR. HERMANSEN: In People v. Collins, the
California Supreme Court said that 1089 is a rule of
efficiency so that courts can efficiently deal with
possible juror bias. And that -- that's still good law.
That hasn't changed.
So that's why Justice Werdegar, in her
concurrence, was saying, we need to be worried about the
Sixth Amendment. And the only reason she joined in the
opinion was it used to be, well, if there's just
substantial evidence that the juror is not deliberating
as a juror should, she wasn't satisfied that that was
sufficient; but, because there had to be a demonstrable
reality from the record that the juror wasn't
deliberating, she signed on in Cleveland.
And in Cleveland, they reversed under 1089.
And this case should have been reversed under 1089.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- Can we go back a minute,
please, to
Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a).
I read the court of appeals' opinion. Most
of it, about six or eight pages, recites the facts.
Then they discuss the law. The legal discussion is on
page 104(a). It's approximately 30 lines long. More
than half of it concerns Federal law.
I mean, they don't just cite that Federal
case. They say, "In assessing whether a juror is
impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal
constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme
Court has said," da, da, da, then they quote it all.
Now, since your argument, the argument in
the -- in this brief here is entirely Sixth Amendment,
as far as I can tell, they say, look, look what happened
here, they took this man off the jury. That violates my
rights to Sixth Amendment right. It says it over and
over and over. I have no doubt you raised it.
And now they give an answer. And the answer
that they give consists of 30 lines, and 16 of the lines
consist of Federal law.
So -- so what's the problem?
MR. HERMANSEN: The problem --
JUSTICE BREYER: The remaining 14 lines do
consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say
they didn't consider the Federal issue?
MR. HERMANSEN: Because Nesler doesn't talk
one iota about kicking off the holdout juror.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, they didn't quote --
Nesler doesn't. What they did in Nesler is quote a
Federal case. And what they do here is not just say
Nesler, they quote the Federal case.
MR. HERMANSEN: And that Federal case has
nothing to do with kicking off a holdout juror.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe it doesn't.
Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly
state what Federal law is. Everybody has some concerns
about that one.
But what I don't see is how when they spend
14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they
believe sets the standard for impartiality and
partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the
Federal issue.
MR. HERMANSEN: You hit the nail right on
the head, Justice Breyer, because they are talking about
impartiality. That's all they're talking about.
They're looking at a Federal case to see what the
definition of impartiality is.
JUSTICE BREYER: For Constitutional
purposes. And this guy was kicked off the jury because
they thought he was not impartial.
MR. HERMANSEN: The bottom line is they did
not apply the Federal rule. And the Federal rule is
that if the juror's views on the merits of the case have
been revealed, then the juror should not be kicked off.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then your claim over
in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider
it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no
reasonable juror could reach -- no reasonable jurist
could reach the conclusion that they reached on the
issue.
That argument is open to you. The only
thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or
everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to
be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue
when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or
wrongly.
MR. HERMANSEN: Respectfully,
Justice Breyer, they don't -- they're just talking about
a definition of one word, of what actual bias is.
JUSTICE BREYER: Which happens to be the
issue in this case.
MR. HERMANSEN: The issue in this case is
can you kick off a juror who has expressed 10 or 15
times -- and this came out right out of the bat -- the
foreperson was called out, asked about some notes and
said, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said, I don't
think there's sufficient evidence. So that's different
from whether we look at Federal law to -- for the
definition of actual bias.
My -- I think it's a reasonable position to
say that you can't infer from this discussion of Nesler,
only talking about what the definition of actual bias
is, that the actual Sixth Amendment claim -- and even
the trial attorney was arguing in Symington, Your Honor,
please don't question these jurors. The foreperson,
right out of the box said that Juror No. 6, 10 or 15
times, has already said that he thinks there isn't
sufficient evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. Now, what the court
says about that argument, what the court of appeals
says, is that the argument of your client not only
misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but
they're criticizing -- and then he says, "It ignores the
trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror
No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased."
So this court of appeals thinks the issue is
whether he had shown sufficient bias. You think the
answer to that is clearly no. The Government thinks
it's yes. And I can understand the differences of
opinion, but I'm back to my question.
It seems to me in 14 lines they do address
the Federal constitutional question of bias. And
that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue,
et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it
correctly.
But you see what's bothering me. And so
I've listened to the answer. Do you want to add
anything?
MR. HERMANSEN: I would respectfully request
that, read -- that reading this whole thing in context,
it's clear that the California Court of Appeals is
dealing with 1089. They are not dealing with the
Federal standard that we're grappling with here, which
is if a juror's views on the merits of a case have been
expressed, can you then interrogate all the jurors --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this -- is this a
holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a
biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts
about the sufficiency of the evidence?
MR. HERMANSEN: No. If there is good
cause --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, answer my question.
Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased
juror?
MR. HERMANSEN: No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, if the
Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased
juror, then why is it that the state court's finding
that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding,
that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased?
The logic is almost inescapable to me.
MR. HERMANSEN: Yeah, right. So for a
minute we'll get into the issue that wasn't certified,
but what happened in this case was the judge -- the
Ninth Circuit found that the finding of bias wasn't good
cause under the Federal standard because the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the California court
find the juror was biased?
MR. HERMANSEN: Yes. Because he was
applying too high of a standard because he said very
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and there was a
quibble about what does the word very add to beyond a
reasonable doubt. And the jury very eloquently
responded that very convinced beyond a reasonable doubt
is the same as convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.
And so that doesn't show bias when
someone --
JUSTICE BREYER: That was one of the things.
Then they go through in those four pages about six
other -- they called -- he gave one story to the judge,
Juror No. 6.
Then the prosecution calls about eight other
jurors, and they come up with quite a different story
about what he was telling them in the jury room and --
that I'm not going to convict him. Well, he didn't
quite say that; he was talking about Vietnam and talking
about the slaves, and you don't want to convict a person
for -- make him return the slave.
I mean, they talked about a lot of things.
And he went through all that, and then concludes he was
biased. And your point was he wasn't biased. He was
going to decide it fairly.
Okay, I'm listening.
MR. HERMANSEN: But the threshold issue is
when the foreperson, at the very, very, very beginning,
says, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said he doesn't
think there is sufficient evidence, all questioning
should have stopped at that point, because there was no
indication of bias.
But -- and how do we know that there --
there's a possibility that he's being kicked off because
of his views on the merits of the case? We know that
because the prosecutor filed a motion saying, let's
reopen questioning. And that -- then the judge said,
okay, yeah, let's reopen questioning.
But the foreman had already said, I think
your response to the jury note has satisfied that; I
think it will be fine. Yet, the prosecutor filed a
motion to reopen because the prosecutor knew that this
juror had reasonable doubts.
And so that's why there's clear evidence in
this case that the motion to dismiss the juror was based
on the juror's views on the merits of the case.
And -- and, also, this is not a capital
case, it's just a -- an LWOP case.
And if there are no further questions, thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Brenan, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BRENAN: Thank you.
I would just like to make about four points.
First, my friend discussed the case of Smith
v. Digmon. And I think I would like to point this Court
to the words that were used in Smith v. Digmon, which is
where the state court chooses to ignore in its opinion.
And as this Court later said in Castille talking about
that, that's an implicit rejection.
So, really, the way it should be interpreted
is, if a state court fails to mention in its opinion
writing, it's implicitly rejected, not that it's been
ignored.
Secondly, I'd just like to agree that, yes,
California believes that 1089 is Constitutional under
the Sixth Amendment. And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit in
Miller v. Stagner said that it was facially
constitutional.
Third, I would just like to agree with
Justice Sotomayor that here, where the trial court made
the finding of bias, that answered the Sixth Amendment
question.
The entire argument below and throughout was
a disagreement as to whether the juror was biased, or
was he just having -- harboring doubts about the
sufficiency of the evidence. Those were the
counter-arguments.
The trial court, by making the determination
that there was bias, necessarily answered that question.
Secondly, as to that point, I would just
like to also point this Court to the language in People
v. Cleveland that talks about agreeing with Thomas, and
Brown, and Symington that you cannot dismiss a juror
based on his views of the evidence. And that's at 21
P.3d at page -- 1236.
So it couldn't have -- in order to have good
cause in California, you couldn't have gotten rid of him
for his views of the evidence.
Finally, I'd just like to say that
Mr. Chief Justice is correct that this would increase
the litigation. We would have courts, Federal habeas
courts all the time trying to decide whether there was a
sufficient indication or not by deciding whether state
law is coterminous with Federal law.
As we've already seen in California,
following the issuance of this decision that's exactly
the type of arguments that we're getting all the time
now. And for that reason, this Court should adopt the
rule that where a fairly presented claim has been
rejected by a state court, it has denied that claim,
adjudicated that claim on the merits.
If there is anything else?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
