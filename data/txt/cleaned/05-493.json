        "content": "[11:05 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next\nin Ayers versus Belmontes.\nMr. Johnson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. JOHNSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns the constitutional\nsufficiency of California's catchall factor (k)\ninstruction, which was given in the penalty-phase portion\nof California capital cases, and which directed the jurors\nto consider any other circumstance that extenuates the\ngravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse\nfor the crime.\nIn this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nheld that this instruction violates the Eighth Amendment\nbecause it allegedly misled the jurors to believe they\ncould not consider so-called forward-looking evidence that\ndid not relate directly to the defendant's actual\nculpability for the crime itself.\nIn the State's view, the Ninth Circuit's\nconclusion is fundamentally flawed, because it rests on an\nillusory distinction between different forms of character\nevidence in a way that is inconsistent with this Court's\nprior decisions in California -- or Boyde versus\nCalifornia and Brown versus Payton.\nIn Boyde, this Court addressed, and rejected, a\nvirtually identical challenge to the factor (k), and\nconcluded that this instruction did, in fact, allow jurors\nto consider non-crime-related evidence; specifically, it\nallowed the jurors to consider evidence of the defendant's\nbackground and character. There was nothing in the Boyde\ndecision to support the Ninth Circuit's distinction\nbetween different forms of character evidence. In fact,\nBoyde implicitly acknowledged that the factor (k) would,\nin fact, be understood to encompass Belmontes' good\ncharacter evidence, in this case, because, for all\npractical purposes, there is no meaningful distinction\nbetween the nature of the background and character offered\nin Boyde and the nature of the background --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Johnson, would you comment\non the footnote on the -- on the -- drawing the\ndistinction with regard to the dance contest that the\ndefendant won in that case, between -- it's over here; I'm\nasking the question -- between facts that occurred before\nthe crime and facts that might have occurred after.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. In footnote 5,\nthis Court addressed a contention, raised for the first\ntime in argument, that Boyde's evidence might be\nadmissible under Skipper versus South Carolina, and this\nCourt distinguished Boyde from Skipper, for a couple of\nreasons. First, as the -- as Your Honor pointed out, the\nevidence in this case related to good-character evidence,\nevents that occurred before the crime itself, unlike in\nSkipper, which dealt with post-crime events. The Court\nalso pointed out that the evidence in Boyde -- his dancing\nachievement, his good character evidence in that case --\nwas not offered for the specific inference that the\nevidence in Skipper was offered. The Court, in footnote 5\n-- and in the opinion, in general, in Boyde -- nonetheless\nfound that this evidence did, in fact, constitute good-\ncharacter evidence of the -- of the defendant's present\ngood character, because it showed that his crime was an\naberration from otherwise good character. Or, as Justice\nMarshall put it in his dissenting opinion, that Boyde had\nredeeming qualities, which is a decidedly forward-looking\nconsideration.\nAnd, as I was saying, the evidence in this case,\nand in Boyde --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be forward-\nlooking, does it? I mean, I thought we've said \"so long\nas it can be taken into account in any manner,\" whether\nbackward-looking or forward-looking. Haven't we said\nthat, explicitly?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes Your Honor. The -- and, in\nfact, the Court has, in Franklin versus Linite, said that\nthey have not distinguished between different forms of\ncharacter evidence. And I understand that, in the past,\nwe've always discussed background and character evidence\nas sort of the same thing. In this case, however, the\nNinth Circuit's conclusion does, in fact, rest on a\ndistinction between different forms of backward-looking\nand forward-looking character --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well it was --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it was addressing itself to\nthe fact -- to the words of the factor (k) instruction.\nHow does post-crime prison conduct reduce the seriousness\nof a previous crime?\nMR. JOHNSON: It does not -- it does not relate\nto the seriousness of the -- of the crime at all. The --\nBoyde's dancing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it has to relate\nto the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor\n(k), doesn't it?\nMR. JOHNSON: It would relate to the gravity --\nto circumstances that extenuate the gravity of the crime,\nfor purposes of a jury's sentencing determination. And\nthe point I'd like to make on that point is this, Your\nHonor. In California, jurors are well aware what their\ntask is at a sentencing determination. In California, the\nguilt and the death eligibility determinations are made\nduring the guilt-phase trial and the jurors are expressly\ntold, during the penalty-phase trial, that their lone\ndetermination, their one concern, is to decide between a\nsentence of death or a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole. And, in that light, the jurors are\nvery well aware that their only determination in a\nCalifornia case is to make a moral, normative\ndetermination, a single normal -- moral normative\ndetermination, as to whether this man, this defendant\nstanding before them in this Court today, deserves death\nor life without possibility --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, now, do you --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- of parole.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do you have an instruction\nthat supports what you've just told us, that the jury is\ntold they have to make a single moral determination? Is\nthat what the court instructed the jury? Or was --\nMR. JOHNSON: No, that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- instructed in items of\nfactor (k)?\nMR. JOHNSON: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think you have to rest\non your argument, that what we are talking about is the\ngravity of his crime \"for purposes of sentencing.\" I\nunderstand that argument. But then, when you go on to\nmake the argument you just made, the jury understands it\nis a single moral judgment, what -- is there some specific\ninstruction you can point to, other than the factor (k)\ninstruction itself?\nMR. JOHNSON: No, they are -- and I may have\nbeen misleading. The jurors are expressly instructed that\nis -- that it is their duty to determine, and their only\nduty to determine, whether the defendant should receive\nlife or death and parole, and -- or life without the\npossibility of parole -- and in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- light of that determination,\njurors, naturally, would understand that they could take\ninto account anything that extenuated the gravity of the\ncrime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what they\nwere told, right? They're instructed that the mitigating\ncircumstances, including factor (k), are merely examples,\nright?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. In this -- yes. In --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about that?\nThis case is unusual, because it has that separate\ninstruction that, \"The mitigating circumstances are merely\nexamples, and you should pay careful attention to those,\nbut you may -- but you may rely on other mitigating\ncircumstances.\"\nMay I ask you, would it have been constitutional\nif the judge had added a sentence at the end of that\ninstruction which said, \"However, you may not consider\nanything mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of\nthe crime\"?\nMR. JOHNSON: It would have been constitutional,\nto the extent that it would have allowed the jurors to\ngive some use whatsoever to Belmontes' proffered evidence\nin mitigation, and that's what this Court's prior cases\nhas -- and, particularly, the various Texas cases have\nsaid that jurors must be given an avenue to make use of\nthe evidence. In California --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure you've answered\nmy question. Would it have been a constitutional addition\nto that instruction to say, \"But I want to -- you to\nclearly understand that it is not to be considered\nmitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime\"?\nWould that have been permissible?\nMR. JOHNSON: It would appear to -- no. It\nwould appear not to be, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because that would have\nforeclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence,\nright?\nMR. JOHNSON: It would have -- well, it would\nforeclose consideration of all present good-character\nevidence, I believe. It would -- it would have foreclosed\nthe consideration of Boyde's evidence, of Payton's\nevidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, then the question in this\ncase is whether the jury might have understood factor (k)\nto limit them to the consideration of factors that\nextenuate the gravity of the crime.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, the -- yes, the question is\nwhether the jurors would reasonably understand the\ninstruction to preclude the consideration of\nconstitutionally -- of relevant evidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This Court, in Payton,\nsaid that it was not unreasonable to conclude that\nevidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime.\nSo, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the\nlines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been\nperfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the\ncrime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, to the -- to the extent --\nthe jurors would have likely understood that, it -- that\ninstruction in Belmontes and in Payton, to extenuate the\ngravity of the crime for purposes of their sentencing\ndetermination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what I thought\nyour position was. And --\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- then you back off of it, and\nyou say, \"extenuate the gravity\" of the crime doesn't\nrelate to anything that's after the crime. I would have\n-- I would have interpreted the phrase to mean \"anything\nthat justifies you in giving a lesser punishment for the\ncrime.\"\nMR. JOHNSON: That's precisely my argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then your answer to\nJustice Stevens should have been different.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, if -- and I apologize if I\nwas misunderstood. My --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the jury in this very\ncase understood that, given the questions that were asked?\nMR. JOHNSON: Oh, yes, Your Honor. In this --\nin this case, I -- there is certainly no reasonable\nlikelihood that the jurors felt precluded, because, as was\npreviously discussed, first there was this additional\ninstruction that supplemented the other instructions in\nthis case that made it very clear that the aggravating\nfactors, the various factors listed in the standard\ninstruction A through G, that those were the -- they could\nonly rely on those two for aggravating factors, but their\nunderstanding of mitigating factors was not limited. In\nfact, they were expressly told that the previous factors\nwere merely examples.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- what\nactually went on? I mean, the jury first came in and\nsaid, \"What if we can't decide? Can we decide by\nmajority?\" And then the question was asked, that seemed\nto indicate the jurors' understanding, that we take all\nthose factors that you told us about, and we just take\nthose factors into account. And there were clarifying\ninstructions asked by the defense that were not given.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, there -- to answer your\nquestions, Your Honor, first, there was no indication at\nthis conference that the jurors were, in fact, confused\nabout whether they could consider any particular evidence\nas being mitigating. The conference itself was called to\naddress, as you mentioned, the jurors' concern -- or the\njurors' inquiry about the result -- what would happen if\nthey couldn't reach a unanimous verdict in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be why they had\nthe conference, but they got into the colloquy that\nJustice Ginsburg described. And the last -- as I recall,\nthe last reference to \"factors,\" whether aggravating or\nmitigating, was simply in terms of the list, or \"the\nlisting,\" I guess the term was, so that the -- it seems to\nme at least, there's a fair argument on the other side of\nthis case, that the last reference that the -- that the\njudge made to the jurors with respect to aggravation or\nmitigation was to refer to a listing. The listing itself\ndidn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the\ninstruction that you are not limited to the listed\nmitigating factors.\nSo, the concern is that, because the last\nreference was to the list, that the list included factor\n(k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give\n-- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest\nemphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions\nin response to questions. Isn't it a pretty good argument\nthat, in this case, there is -- there's a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jurors went back to their task\nthinking that they were limited to the list?\nMR. JOHNSON: Respectfully, no, Your Honor. And\nthe reason why is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I'm not necessarily\nsaying that's my position, so you don't have to be\nrespectful to me about it. Just --\nMR. JOHNSON: I'll be respectful anyhow, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- knock it down if you can.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Be respectful anyway.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. The point is, with this\ninstruction conference, there -- the -- an argument that\nthis reference to \"the listing\" reflected some\nunconstitutional -- or constitutionally restrictive view\npresupposes that the jurors reasonably would have\nmisinterpreted the meaning of the factor (k); and there is\nnothing in there -- in any of these questions to put\nanybody on notice that that -- that they had any such\nconcerns. And first --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except for the language\nof factor (k) itself. And if -- without some\nembellishment, isn't it a bit of a stretch to think that\nfactor (k) goes as far as Skipper evidence?\nMR. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor, it's not a stretch\nat all, because any evidence relating to the defendant's\nbackground and character, his present character in court,\ncould be seen as extenuating the gravity of the crime for\nsentencing purposes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well --\nMR. JOHNSON: And the jurors --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- California itself\nrecognized that there was a problem here of jury\nconfusion. And now they have amended the provision so\nthat it would be clear to any juror.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor, in\nPeople v. Easley the California --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or maybe they thought that was\na problem of Ninth Circuit confusion rather than jury\nconfusion.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, having that opinion in\nfront of them, you would think they would amend it, of\ncourse, to prevent that kind of decision again.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, they -- what they were doing\nwas certainly a prophylactic measure here, to -- they\nrecognized that perhaps there might be some concern of\nconfusion, and so they wanted to forestall any chance of\nthat happening. But notably, this case and -- this case,\nand no other California Supreme Court case, has found that\nthe factor (k) instruction, the pre-Easley version of it,\nby itself, did mislead the jurors. In fact, the Supreme\nCourt, in this case, came down 7-0 in support of the\nconclusion that the jurors were properly told about the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does this factor (k)\ncome from? What was the source of it?\nMR. JOHNSON: The factor (k), as the entire\nstandard instruction given in these cases, recites\nverbatim the language of the California statute, which is\nCalifornia penal code section 190.3. And, interestingly\nenough, the -- not only the California Supreme Court, but\nthis Court, implicitly has -- have both said that not only\nthe California statute, but the instruction -- this\nstandard instruction, upon -- which is based on the\nstatute, do allow consideration of all relevant mitigating\nfactors. In fact, as far back as 1983, in this Court's\nCalifornia v. Ramos decision, this Court stated, albeit in\ndicta, that the factor (k) -- or that the standard\ninstruction would allow consideration of background and\ncharacter evidence; and, in fact, the Court stated, in\nfootnote 20 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Johnson, I don't mean\nto interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your\n-- you stick to your answer on -- to my question, earlier,\n--\nMR. JOHNSON: Okay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- because you -- I think you\nchanged your answer after Justice -- the Chief Justice and\nJustice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake.\nAre you -- is it your position that it would be\nconstitutional to instruct the jury that, \"You may not\nconsider any evidence mitigating, unless it extenuates the\ngravity of the crime\"?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor, because the\njurors would -- even if that instruction were given, the\njurors would understand that an instruction that\nextenuates the gravity of the crime would encompass any\nrelevant character evidence. And this Court has made\nthese determinations all the time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is --\nMR. JOHNSON: That --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that answer consistent with\nthe position of defense counsel, who said he would not\ninsult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them\nthat the religious conversion of the defendant did not\nextenuate the gravity of the crime?\nMR. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor. What the -- what\nthe counsel actually said was that the defendant's\nreligious conversion did not provide an excuse for the\ncrime itself. And, in fact, that argument was, itself,\nechoing the language of the factor (k) instruction, which\nof course --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's right.\nMR. JOHNSON: -- directs the jurors to consider\nany other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the\ncrime, even though it's not a legal excuse for the crime.\nAnd so, counsel was dovetailing his very effective\nargument with the -- with the instruction itself. And\nwhat's significant here is that, like in Payton, like in\nBoyde, this case involved virtually all of Belmontes'\npenalty-phase evidence. And the entire main thrust of his\nargument to the jury was that he could not make it on the\noutside, but he could fit in the system and contribute to\nsociety in the future, if given a chance on the inside.\nAnd again, as was true in Boyde and Payton --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If that were true would that\nhave extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get\nalong in prison?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, for purposes of jurors -- at\njury's sentencing determination, absolutely, because it\nwould be viewed as good-character evidence, precisely --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you think juries would\nclearly understand that what he did in the future in\nprison would extenuate the gravity of the crime.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor, because, in light\nof everything that's been said and done in this trial, as\nthe Boyde Court noted, jurors do not parse instructions\nfor subtle shades of meaning; they understand instructions\nin a commonsense manner, and in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The prosecutor didn't\nobject to any of this mitigating -- mitigation evidence\nthat was submitted by the defendant, did he?\nMR. JOHNSON: The prosecutor objected to none of\nthis evidence. And, in fact, the prosecutor, in closing\nstatement, argued that the -- not only could the jurors\nconsider Belmontes' forward-looking prospects, but the\njurors should consider those prospects. So, in this case\nwhat we have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the prosecutor's\nclosing was schizophrenic, because he said, \"But really\nthis shouldn't matter.\"\nMR. JOHNSON: He acknowledged it was something\nthat -- this argument was something that was proper for\nconsideration, but -- however, he argued that the evidence\nof Belmontes' religious conversion, which happens -- you\nknow, and then lapsed immediately before he committed the\nmurder, in this case -- was very weak evidence. But he\ndid, nonetheless, tell the jurors that they could consider\nBelmontes' prior character as bearing on his present\ncharacter now.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, didn't he go beyond saying\nit was weak? He did say that, but didn't he say that he\ndoubted that it fit within (k)?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. JOHNSON: He's -- yes, the prosecutor first\nstated that the factor (k) was a catchall, a true\ncatchall.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, the prosecutor, I take it,\nwould have answered Justice Stevens's question the other\nway. The prosecutor would have said, \"Well, no, this\nprobably would not be understood by the jurors to refer to\nthe gravity of the offense.\"\nMR. JOHNSON: No, Your Honor, because in the --\nin the previous page, the prosecutor did State that it was\na catchall, you know, which, by implication, incorporates\neverything, but -- and the prosecutor's argument, that,\n\"I'm not sure if it fits in there,\" signifies that there\n-- not that the evidence -- that such evidence could not\nbe considered as mitigating as a -- in a general matter,\nbut that -- just that the religious evidence in this case\nwas extremely weak, to the point of having, as a practical\npurpose, no mitigating value. The prosecutor followed\nthat comment. I'm not sure it fits in there, in next\nbreath, with, \"It's\" -- something to the effect of, \"It's\nno secret that Belmontes' religious evidence is pretty\nshaky here,\" and went on to conclude that. But then, in\nthe next breath, he said, \"But, nonetheless, this is\nsomething that's proper for you to consider.\"\nAnd, again, reasonable jurors, hearing this --\nhaving been given the instruction here -- would reasonably\ninterpret this -- all of this evidence as something they\ncould use to extenuate the gravity of the crime. And\nparticularly in this context, because, like in Boyde, in\naddition to this factor (k), the standard instruction\ndirected the jurors to consider all the evidence. The\nfirst factor of the enumerated factors -- (a) through (g),\nin this case -- told the jurors that they should -- that\nthey should focus on -- that the first thing to consider\nwas the -- or the circumstances of the crime itself.\nThe final factor, therefore, that any other\ncircumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime\nwould clearly be understood to relate to matters outside\nthe crime itself. And, to the extent that there was any\nambiguity about the meaning of that in this particular\ncase, the argument by counsel, the additional instruction\nhere, clarified that to the point that there is certainly\nno reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt that they\nwere constrained in considering any mitigating evidence in\nany way they thought fit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Johnson, when I asked you\nabout the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a\nCalifornia statutory cite, but is there -- does it come\nfrom any model code? Does any other State have such a\nprovision? How widespread is it?\nMR. JOHNSON: Of the -- the actual wording of\nthis instruction?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many States have an\ninstruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances\nof the crime?\nMR. JOHNSON: I'm not sure, Your Honor. I'm not\nsure. I know that this -- that this instruction itself\ncame from the statute, which, in turn, was adopted from\nthe California Briggs initiative in the 1978 statute. I'm\nnot aware of any -- of any other States -- there may or\nmay not be -- who have adopted the same statutory model\nthat California has.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- California hasn't\nhad it since 1983, right?\nMR. JOHNSON: Pardon me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: California hasn't used this\ninstruction since 1983.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's correct, Your Honor. After\nPeople v. Easely, the California Supreme Court augmented\nthe instruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, is this a one-of-a-kind\ncase? I mean, you said, in your brief, that the Ninth\nCircuit decision threatens many other valid California\ndeath judgments. But these would all have to be rather\nancient cases.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. And, unfortunately, there's\n-- there are several of them that are still being\nlitigated. I've done research on this issue, and, as of\nthis date, I can't give you an actual -- an absolute\nnumber, but I believe there is approximately 15 cases\npending, like this one, that involve the factor (k)\ninstruction -- this factor (k) instruction -- that involve\nevidence of -- somehow, future-looking evidence, which --\nall character evidence, frankly, is future-looking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- whereas --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that wouldn't wash out, on\nthe other grounds?\nMR. JOHNSON: Right, that -- and -- that are\nstill pending, and that are -- unlike Payton, are not\ngoverned by the AEDPA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying those\nconvictions are more than -- more than 23 years old?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately,\nthere's -- they're -- I believe all of them are being\nlitigated now in the Federal court system in California.\nIf you have no further questions, I guess I'll\nreserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Multhaup.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC S. MULTHAUP\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. MULTHAUP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHere is Respondent's 60-second nutshell summary\nof our core position. This case does not turn on the\nconstitutional factor (k) standing alone. Rather, it\nturns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test,\nto the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during\nthe arguments, instructions to deliberations at the\npenalty trial of this case.\nHere are the two key components of our claim.\nDuring arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the\njury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious\nexperience was not covered by factor (k). However, both\ncounsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered\nanyway. Now, this is unusual, because, of all -- of all\nthe things that the district attorney and the defense\ncounsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on,\nand it's likely that the jury would have taken note of\nthat.\nThe case then proceeded to instructions and\ndeliberations. The jury came back to court, announced\nthat they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority\nfavoring life. The turning point occurred when one juror,\nJuror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the\nspecific list of factors previously given was the only\nbase -- was the only framework within which the penalty\ndecision could be made. At that point, the trial court\nhad a constitutional obligation to disabuse Juror Hern and\nthe rest of the assembled jurors of that misapprehension\nand, at the very least, to reinstruct the jurors that the\nenumerated factors were merely illustrative and not\nexhaustive, and instruct the jurors that the jury had to\nconsider all of the mitigating evidence.\nThe trial court did neither, with the result\nthat the jury all too likely returned to its deliberations\nwith the belief that the only factors -- the only matters\nthey considered -- could consider were those encompassed\nwithin the enumerated factors, and believing -- based on\ncounsel's prior arguments -- that factor (k) did not\ninclude the Youth Authority religious-experience evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When did the defense counsel say\nthat this evidence did not fit within factor (k)?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, it occurred in\nargument. And my counsel -- esteemed co-counsel will give\nme the exact page -- but it occurred in the context -- the\ncontext -- during the prosecutor's argument, the\nprosecutor said to the jury that, \"I suspect\" -- and then\nhe, for emphasis, said, \"I can't imagine that you won't be\ntold that the religious-conversion evidence doesn't fit\nwithin factor (k).\" And, at that point, he expressed\nreservations, doubts, as to whether it did fit in factor\n(k) or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- any other factor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that matter?\nBecause the jury was told that the factors were merely\nexamples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.\nMR. MULTHAUP: I'm more than --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It probably didn't fit\ninto factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Well, it has -- if it -- oh, Your\nHonor, the -- calling your -- or you've called my\nattention to the instruction that said that the set -- in\nthe prior set of -- or in the general set of instructions,\nthat the enumerated factors were merely illustrative.\nNow, that instruction had a cloud of confusion surrounding\nit, because the way it was phrased was, the Court said,\n\"The mitigating factors that I have expressed to you are\nillustrative.\" There was no list of mitigating factors.\nThere was only a single list, unitary list, of factors\nthat could be either aggravating or mitigating, depending\non a jury's decision.\nThe instruction that you're referring to, Your\nHonor, was a -- was the result of the trial court denying\nsome, and granting some, parts of the special instructions\nrequested by the defense. And so, when the trial court\nsaid to the jury, \"The list of mitigating factors is\nillustrative only,\" I -- we, who know the background of\nthis, understand what -- the point he was trying to make,\nbut the jury, hearing it, they would think, very\nreasonably, \"There's no list of mitigating factors.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: You said this case is different\nbecause both counsel told the jury that the evidence that\nyou're relying on did not fit within factor (k). And I'm\nnot sure what you're referring to.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, as to defense counsel, are\nyou referring to what you quoted on page 9 of your brief,\nwhere he says, \"I'm not going to insult you\" -- what you\nhighlighted on page 9 -- \"I'm not going to insult you by\ntelling you I think it excuses, in any way, what happened\nhere\"? That's what you -- is that what you're referring\nto?\nMR. MULTHAUP: That's one of the passages that I\nam referring to, and it came as a direct response to the\nDistrict Attorney, in effect, calling out the defense\nattorney, \"I can't imagine that you won't be told that\nthis fits within factor (k).\" So, at that point, the\ndefense counsel had to make a decision, \"Okay, either I\nhave to argue that my Skipper evidence is -- my square peg\nof Skipper evidence has to fit in the round hole of\" --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't he --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- \"factor (k)\" --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- saying something very\ndifferent there? He isn't -- he's not saying, \"This\ndoesn't fit within factor (k).\" And he makes no reference\nto factor (k). He says nothing about \"extenuating.\" He\nsays \"excuses.\" Isn't that something very different,\n\"excusing\" the crime?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, this Court has used\nthe terms \"extenuate\" and \"excuse\" as synonyms in Boyde\nand --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you had been --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- in Payton with --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- if you were arguing this to\nthe jury, would you have said, \"You know, my client earned\na position of responsibility on the fire crew that\npatrolled the Sierra Foothills, and, therefore, that\nexcuses the crime that you've found that he committed\nhere\"?\nMR. MULTHAUP: No. No. The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see, anywhere in Mr.\nSchick's statement, at least from 165 to 170, where he\nsays what you said he said. Now, maybe he says it some\nother place, but -- I'd like the reference to it -- but I\n-- what I have him as saying is that -- he says, for\nexample, several times, \"The presence -- I don't suggest\nthat the -- that the presence of religion, in itself, is\ntotally mitigating.\" Well, it certainly wasn't, in this\ninstance. I gather I'm right. Am I right in thinking\nthat all this religious conversion took place before he\nmurdered the girl? So, this is not a case of your trying\nto get some evidence that took place after the crime.\nMR. MULTHAUP: That's right. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that's right, then maybe it\ndoes more easily fit within factor (k). The prosecutor\ntold the jury they should consider it, or they could. The\njudge told the jury they could consider it -- it sounded\nas -- says, \"You take it -- this is an example\" -- he\nsays, \"It's an example in factor (k).\" Maybe he's wrong,\nbut they certainly likely think they can consider it. And\nMr. Schick doesn't say it's not in factor (k). At least,\nI don't see it. That's why I'm asking.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, the whole point of\nfactor (k) is that -- evidence that's an excuse for the\ncrime. And if we're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I know the point of\nfactor (k). I'm trying to be absolutely certain, before\nthinking --\nMR. MULTHAUP: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- he didn't say it, that I've\nmade every effort to get from you the place where -- that\nthis -- where the defense counsel says, \"Jury, I agree,\nyou cannot put this into factor (k).\"\nMR. MULTHAUP: Okay. And, Your Honor, looking\nat it in context, given the district attorney's argument,\nthe district attorney says, \"I can't imagine you won't be\ntold that it doesn't -- that it -- that it doesn't fit\nwithin factor (k).\" So, the defense attorney gets up and\nsays, \"I'm -- I am going to tell you that it doesn't\nwithin -- fit within factor (k). It doesn't\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that page --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- \"constitute\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- where he says that is\nwhere?\nMR. MULTHAUP: When he -- when he says, Your\nHonor, \"It doesn't constitute an excuse in any way.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Were his words \"it doesn't\nconstitute an excuse\"?\nMR. MULTHAUP: \"It doesn't excuse, in any way,\"\nYour Honor. And we -- as a matter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- of semantics --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but, in a sense, that's\nright, just like remorse. Remorse doesn't excuse the\ncrime. It's a consideration that you take into account in\nassessing the gravity of the crime for purposes of\npunishment.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Okay. Your Honor, this is a\npoint of, perhaps, semantics. But the -- by the time you\nget to penalty phase, there's nothing to excuse the crime,\nin the sense of self-defense or \"not guilty by reason of\ninsanity.\" The only thing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"in any way.\"\nMR. MULTHAUP: It does say \"in any way.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's on page 9 of your -- of\nyour brief. The --\nMR. MULTHAUP: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- italicized portion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's on 166 of the joint\nappendix.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Thank you.\nAnd if the -- if trial counsel was trying to\nmake the point that, \"Well, it doesn't constitute a legal\nexcuse, but it does constitute a partial excuse or some\nkind of mitigating evidence under this factor,\" he would\nhave put that in there. The clear import, from the\ncontext here, is that defense counsel was not trying to\nsell the jury a position that was, on its face, untenable,\nbut, rather, to acknowledge that it did not fit within the\n\"excuse the gravity of the crime\" factor, which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only if you think that excusing\nthe crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same\nthing, which I don't really think.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Well, Your Honor, there's two --\nI'd like to make two responses to that. First of all,\nthis Court has used those terms interchangeably, in Boyde\nand Payton, with respect to mitigating evidence. Second\nof all, let's -- as a -- as a practical matter, we have a\ndefense attorney arguing a case to a jury in a Central\nValley California county. And if the defense attorney has\na choice between two synonyms, one which is used in common\nparlance, \"excuse,\" and one which is not used in common\nparlance, \"extenuate,\" it hardly constitutes an -- a\ndefect or concession on his part if he were to say, \"This\ndoes not excuse the crime in any way.\" That's plain\nspeaking to a jury, that -- and what he -- what he --\ncounsel --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't a jury think all\nthis evidence must have some purpose? The only purpose it\ncould have is to -- is to propel us toward life rather\nthan death. I mean, the bulk of the evidence at the\nsentencing phase -- wasn't it? -- was how he behaved when\nhe was a prisoner before.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, not -- that's not\nexactly what happened at penalty phase here. This is not\na case like Boyde, where all the evidence was background\nand character evidence, and it's not a case like Payton,\nwhere the only evidence was a post-crime conversion. This\ncase involved a mixture of evidence, where first there was\nthe grandfather who testified to what a bad upbringing he\nhad, traditional background and character evidence. The\nmother testified to her undying love for her son,\ntraditional evidence. Friends testified to his good\ncharacteristics. And then, at the end, there was a clear\nsegment that related to his good performance in Youth\nAuthority and his religious conversion. So, it was only a\n-- it was a partial part of -- partial part of the\npenalty-phase presentation, but it certainly wasn't the\nentire presentation, as it was in Boyde and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even so, there was --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- Payton.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there was extensive\ntestimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison\nsetting.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Well, certainly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the jury must have\nthought there's some reason why the judge allowed that\nevidence in. And what reason could it be, other than to\nshow that, if he is given life, he will be a good\nprisoner?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, that's a very\nlogical, sensible thing for the jury to have thought. And\nnow I'd like to drop the second shoe of the key components\nof our claim. The first shoe was the arguments of counsel\nthat we've discussed the various permutations on. The\nmost likely -- so, the jury began deliberating based on\nthe instructions and the arguments that they had -- that\nthey had had. And it's entirely likely that when the jury\nwas favoring a life verdict during the first part of their\ndeliberations, Belmontes' prospects for good behavior in\nprison and contributions were part of the debate.\nWhen Juror Hern asked for judicial clarification\n-- not clarification, confirmation -- of a very specific\nview that only the enumerated factors could be considered\nin the penalty-phase deliberations, the jury -- and the\ntrial court assented without qualification to that -- at\nthat point, the jury would have very likely thought, \"The\ntrial court who holds a position of great deference to us,\nmuch more than most other authority figures we have in our\nlife, just told us what the marching orders are here.\nThis is the framework for decision.\"\nNow, what happened during the -- during the\ntrial is the defense -- and I'm suggesting what the jury\nmight have thought, in relation to your question -- that,\n\"The defense attorney was taking his best shot for his\nclient, pushing the envelope, maybe went over the top a\nlittle bit. But defense attorneys do that. The\nprosecutor was being a very decent stand-up kind of\nperson, and -- but, right now, when we get down to the\nbusiness of making the decision, we have to follow the\nrules. And the rules are what the -- are what the -- are\nwhat Judge Gisson just confirmed to us, that we are\nlimited to the enumerated factors, and factor (k) does not\ninclude the Skipper evidence, because that was explained\nto us by counsel.\"\nI would like to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you move on,\nCounsel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- don't you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- don't you -- excuse me.\nExcuse me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- don't you have to\naddress the Teague question a little bit? You -- you're\nentitled to this new rule adopted by the Court of Appeals\nonly if it was dictated by precedent at the time the\njudgment became final. Isn't that kind of a hard argument\nto make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v.\nPayton?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, I don't see -- as to\nthe first part of Your Honor's question, I don't believe\nthat there is any new rule whatsoever in the Ninth Circuit\nopinion. It's a straightforward application of Boyde to\nthe totality of circumstances that occurred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of Boyde? It's\nstraightforward application of Boyde?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Yes. The Ninth Circuit began\nwith Boyde, and it went through all of the proceedings at\ntrial, and concluded that there was a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury didn't consider Skipper evidence.\nAnd that's what we're asking this Court to do, the exact\nsame -- applying the Boyde test to the rule -- the rule of\ndecision that was clearly established by this Court as of\n1986, and reiterated and expanded by this Court in 1987,\nwith Skipper.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what has to be clear\nunder Teague is not just the rule, but the rule's\napplication in circumstances like this. There are a lot\nof rules that are clear, but if Teague means anything at\nall it has to mean that you should have known that, in\nthis case, the rule would produce this result. So it's\nnot enough to say that there was a rule. There are a lot\nof rules out there, but the question is whether the\noutcome should have been clear at the time. Isn't that\nwhat Teague means?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Certainly, Your Honor. And\napplying -- because when we -- when we take a look at\nPenry I, this Court said -- in response to a Teague\nargument by the attorney general, this Court held that\nPenry got past the threshold Teague issue because of -- at\nthe time of the finality of his direct appeal, in 1986,\nthe rule was well-established that the sentencer may not\nbe precluded from considering relevant evidence in\nmitigation, by Lockett, Eddings, and others. So if that\nwas a firmly established rule as of 1986 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Penry was\nconsiderably tightened by the subsequent decision in\nGraham versus Collins, though.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Graham v. Collins was an AEDPA\ncase, as was Payton. So, we have a very, very different\nstandard of review. And, if I may, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know Payton was an\nAEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read\ninstruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be\nconsidered. And I would have thought, if it was not\nunreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary\nreading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit\nadopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated\nby existing precedent.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Ah. Well, the -- our position in\nrelation to that is, the direct quote from -- direct quote\nfrom Payton itself, in which the Court said that, assuming\nthe California Supreme Court was incorrect, Payton,\nnonetheless, loses. Here we're arguing that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court was incorrect, and, therefore,\nBelmontes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because if it was --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- should win.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because, even if\nincorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable. And I'm just\nhaving trouble understanding how, if a contrary position\nis dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180\ndegrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this\nCourt as reasonable.\nMR. MULTHAUP: The unusual facts of this case\nare much stronger in favor of relief under the Boyde test\nthan were those in Payton. Therefore, applying the\nlongstanding rule of Lockett and Eddings to the different,\nand more compelling, facts of this case, there is no\nreason -- there is every reason to provide Belmontes\nrelief, where it was denied to Payton. And there's no\nreason to believe that the California Supreme Court was\nbeing incorrect, but reasonable, in -- to presume, or\nfind, based on Payton, that the California Supreme Court\nwas being incorrect, but reasonable, in this case.\nPenry could not have won his case under the --\nunder the -- that particular analysis, because the Texas\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- Supreme Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Graham didn't win his\ncase.\nMR. MULTHAUP: And Payton didn't win either, but\nwe're operating under the prior regime. So -- I\nunderstand the -- the Court is suggesting, I believe, that\nsomehow Payton is a sword, in some sense, to deny relief\nas to all California defendants under penalty-phase\ninstructional claims cited by the California Supreme\nCourt, even under different facts and under more egregious\ncircumstances. And I -- I may have -- be misinterpreting\nthe Court's argument, but I would argue that there are any\nnumber of scenarios, notwithstanding Payton, that would\nrequire relief under the pre-AEDPA standards when you\napply the test of Boyde to all the circumstances of the\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Multhaup, one aspect of\nyour argument I wish you would clarify, and that's in your\nbrief at page 20, footnote 3. As I understand it, you are\nsaying -- you are not challenging factor -- the factor (k)\ninstruction as excluding Skipper evidence. Your challenge\nis limited to this particular case. Is that what you're\nsaying in that footnote?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Yes, Your Honor. I'm not here to\nrefight the battle of Boyde. You know, I spilled tons of\nhours of time and printer's ink in an amicus brief in\n1989, and I understand the concept of \"you lose.\" What we\nare arguing is that the Boyde test should be applied to\nthe circumstances of this case, and that factor (k),\nstanding alone, in a -- in a case where defendant relies\non Skipper evidence, does not warrant relief by that fact\nalone. Here we have much more than that fact which, under\nBoyde, does call for relief.\nI would like to give --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- Respondent's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the \"much more\" is the\nquestions that the jury asked?\nMR. MULTHAUP: The \"much more\" includes the\narguments by counsel, which, notwithstanding different --\nreasonably differing views of it, does put a context on\nthe -- put into context what defense counsel was arguing.\nWe have the confusion inherent in the instruction that the\nCourt gave the -- the putatively proper instruction about\nthem being illustrative rather than exhaustive. We have\nthe colloquy during the penalty deliberations. We have\nJuror Hailstone's follow-up question regarding the\npossibility of considering the availability of psychiatric\ntreatment, which was explicitly rejected, and very likely\nconfirming the message that had just been given to -- via\nthe answer to Juror Hern's case, that only the enumerated\nfactors can be considered.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no\nevidence on that question presented, right? The reason\nthat the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be\nconsidered is because neither party had put evidence on\nthat question before the jury.\nMR. MULTHAUP: Well, Your Honor, you know that,\nbecause you're the Chief Justice, but the people of San\nJoaquin County had no idea that that was the reason, and\nif not explained --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. It's a question\nof what mitigating evidence was put before the jury. The\njurors couldn't consider that, because it was the -- quite\nproper for the trial judge to say, \"You can't consider\nthat, because there was no evidence on it.\"\nMR. MULTHAUP: It would have been perfectly\nproper for the trial court to say, \"You can't consider\nthat, because\" -- appended exactly the -- the explanation\nthat you gave. And the jurors would have understood that\nthey had to consider the evidence presented, but they\ncouldn't speculate about other things. If, at the crucial\npoint in the proceedings, the trial court had said, \"Juror\nHern, you do have to pay attention to those factors, but\nthey're illustrative rather than exhaustive, and you must\nconsider all of Belmontes' evidence. Please go back and\ndeliberate,\" that would have cured the errors here.\nHowever, the error occurred when the -- when the\ncourt didn't do that. And Juror Hailstone's question --\nthe trial court's answer could only have reaffirmed the\nmisimpression that the court returned to the -- to\ndeliberate with.\nI have a -- just a few minutes, and I would like\nto give Respondent's answer to Justice Kennedy's question\nto Petitioner, paraphrasing somewhat, How does Skipper\nevidence extenuate the gravity of the crime? And the\nanswer is, it doesn't at all, logically, ethically, or\nmorally. As defense counsel conveyed to the jury, the\ncircumstances of the crime are what they are, and there's\nnothing that can be done about that. The circumstances of\nthe crime are immutable and irreparable. The only thing\nthat can be extenuated in a penalty presentation is\nPetitioner's culpability for the crime. And counsel\nargued that Petitioner's culpability was some -- to some\nextent, extenuated and mitigated because the evidence\nshowed that there was no plan to kill the decedent when\nthey went to her house.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have said that remorse\nextenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment\npurposes, under factor (k).\nMR. MULTHAUP: Well, of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that --\nMR. MULTHAUP: -- course --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that -- and that -- that's\npost -- that's post-crime.\nMR. MULTHAUP: And, Your Honor, this pre- and\npost- distinction, I don't believe has -- is a relevant\ndistinction. It's whether it's functionally related to\nthe culpability for the crime, because when a defendant\nexpresses remorse --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, you think pre- and crime --\npre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case?\nI thought that was really the linchpin of your argument?\nMR. MULTHAUP: No, Your Honor. It's that\nSkipper evidence is a specific and different kind of\nmitigating character evidence that doesn't extenuate the\ngravity of the crime, but it provides a different kind of\nreason for sparing the defendant's life. There is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And yours is both pre- and\npost- -- that is, you're referring to conduct that took\nplace before this crime was committed -- that is, his\nprior incarceration -- and asking the jury to project that\nforward to say, \"That's how he behaved in prison, before\nhe committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's\nlikely to behave again.\"\nMR. MULTHAUP: Well, all of the Skipper evidence\nin this case occurred as a matter of historical fact\nbefore the capital crime and -- which, in fact, gives it's\nmuch -- gives it much more weight, because it can't be\nsuggested that he contrived his good conduct after being\narrested for a capital crime.\nBut, I'm going to make a broad statement here.\nThere is no reported case in California where either a\ndefense attorney or the California Supreme Court makes a\ntext-based argument that Skipper evidence extenuates the\ngravity of the crime, because it's illogical and doesn't\nwork. Look what the defense attorney did in Payton. He\nargued that, \"Well, of course you have to consider that\nevidence under factor (k), because it's a catchall. It's\nsupposed to be inclusive.\" That's not a text-based\nargument, that's a circumstantial-evidence kind of -- kind\nof argument.\nWhen we look at that -- when we look at that\nphrasing of \"extenuating the gravity of the crime,\" with\nits plain meaning in English, and the distinction made, in\nSkipper itself, that Skipper evidence does not relate to\nPetitioner's culpability for the crime, the jury is going\nto appreciate what the -- what the attorney said to them,\nthat the -- that the Youth Authority religious evidence\ndoes not extenuate the gravity of the crime, but has\nindependent mitigating effect outside those enumerated\nfactors. There's nothing -- that's a perfectly\nappropriate position to take, no constitutional problem\nthere until, during deliberations, the trial court\nconfirmed that they could only consider the enumerated\nfactors and could not consider nonstatutory mitigation,\nthe -- any other kind of mitigation, because that, in\neffect, closed out consideration of the -- of the Skipper\nevidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the judge's response to\nJuror Hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to\nit, if it was as obviously misleading as you say?\nMR. MULTHAUP: Your Honor, it's like being --\nstepping off a curb and being hit by a bicycle that you\ndidn't see coming. This occurs in the middle of jury\ndeliberations. Nobody expected a juror to ask a question\nof this type. And, of course, I'm speculating here, but\nthe trial court fielded the questions, responded off-the-\ncuff, and the juror -- jury went back.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's why you have counsel\nthere, to help the court when the court makes a real\nboo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say,\none would have expected some objection from defense\ncounsel.\nMR. MULTHAUP: One could also have expected the\ntrial court to say, \"Let's take a minute to think about\nthat. We're going into recess, and I'd like counsel's\nopinion about this, because this is a difficult question.\nIt's not a simple yes-or-no answer.\" Under --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Johnson, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIn a minute, I'd like to briefly touch on the\nTeague issue. At the time Belmontes' judgment was\npending, there was no precedent that would have dictated\nthe Ninth Circuit's conclusion here regarding the\nsufficiency of the factor (k) instruction. And, indeed,\nthis Court's subsequent holdings, in Boyde and Payton,\nbear out the fact that it was at least -- that that\ndecision certainly was not dictated by precedent.\nIn Boyde, this Court dealt with evidence of good\ncharacter that was precisely the same as the evidence of\ngood character here. The -- Belmontes' evidence of having\nsucceeded during a prior commitment and religious\nconversion, that he might be able to help others in the\nfuture, was good-character evidence in the same way that\nBoyde's evidence of having won a dancing prize, of having\nhelped children, of having helped artistic -- having\nartistic abilities, was all good character. And there is\ncertainly nothing in Boyde to suggest that there is any\ndistinction. But, even if there was, it would not be one\nthat would compel all rational jurists to distinguish the\ntwo cases.\nAnd that's further buttressed, of course, by\nthis Court's more recent opinion in Payton, which found\nthat it was at least reasonable for the State Court to\nconclude that Payton's post-crime forward-looking evidence\nwould be understood to fall within the factor (k)\ninstruction if it was at least reasonable for California\nto find that such forward -- post-crime forward-looking\nevidence would fit within the factor (k). The Ninth\nCircuit's conclusion, to the contrary, regarding pre-crime\ngood-character evidence, certainly was not dictated by\nprecedent.\nI'd also like to address, quickly in my\nremaining time, Mr. Multhaup's arguments regarding the\njury -- or the argument of counsel and the jury questions.\nAgain, Boyde counsels that the relevant\nconsideration is whether there is any reasonable\nlikelihood that the jurors view the instructions in a way\nas to foreclose consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence. In this case, both -- the jurors were\ninstructed with the factor (k). As I've said, they were\ngiven the supplemental instruction that said that the --\nthat the previous listing -- factors were only examples of\nsome. And then, both counsel clearly said that the jurors\ncould, and should, consider this evidence.\nIs there some possibility out there that some\njuror might have misinterpreted this in a -- in a -- in a\ndifferent manner? I suppose so, but there is certainly no\nreasonable likelihood, especially in light of the fact\nthat Belmontes' evidence, virtually all of it, was\ndirected at this main thrust of the argument. And, just\nlike in Payton and Boyde, for the jurors to have believed\nthat they could nonetheless not consider that evidence\nwould have turned the whole proceedings in a virtual\ncharade or a pointless exercise.\nSo far as the questions during juror\ndeliberations, it's, first, important to recognize, none\nof these jurors said anything to suggest that they were\nactually confused about whether they could consider any\nevidence offered. Their question -- Juror Hern's question\nmerely related to her -- she wanted to confirm her\nunderstanding about the role of balancing mitigating\nversus aggravating factors under California law. And\ncertainly the parties there if -- would have been in a\nbetter position to realize it if these questions somehow\nsuggested some ambiguity. There was no objection there.\nMoreover, in the same conference, the judge advised the\njurors to review the instructions again, which, of course,\nagain included the factor (k), and which, of course,\nincluded the supplemental instruction that said that their\nconsideration of mitigating factors was not limited to\nthose that had been listed, but those that had been listed\nwere merely examples.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I will\nsubmit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
