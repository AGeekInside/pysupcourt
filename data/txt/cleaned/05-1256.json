        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Philip Morris v. Williams.\nMr. Frey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FREY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: This case is here following this\nCourt's remand to the Oregon courts to reconsider their\ndecision in light of State Farm, a task at which we\nsubmit the Oregon courts completely failed. It presents\ntwo independent but thematically interrelated issues,\nboth of which implicate what the Court said in State\nFarm, which is that, and I quote, \"courts must ensure\nthat the measure of punishment is both reasonable and\nproportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and\nto the general damages recovered.\"\nNow significantly, Respondent defends\nneither -- oh, I should stop for a minute and describe\nthe issues. So the first issue is whether the Oregon\nSupreme Court properly held that Philip Morris was\ncorrectly denied an instruction which would have told\nthe jury that it was not to punish for harm to\nnonparties. The Oregon Supreme Court held that that\ninstruction was legally incorrect, it was proper for the\njury to punish for harm to nonparties, and therefore the\ninstruction was correctly denied.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frey, are you talking\nabout what is numbered, is it number 34?\nMR. FREY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the --\nMR. FREY: Yes. The key paragraph from\nnumber 34 which is set forth at page 4 of our brief, as\nwell as numerous other places in the materials. It\nsays, the size of any punishment should bear reasonable\nrelationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the\ndefendant's punishable misconduct. Although you may\nconsider the extent of harm suffered by others in\ndetermining what that reasonable relationship is, you're\nnot to punish the defendant for the impact of its\nalleged misconduct of other persons who may bring\nlawsuits of their own, etc.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't think that\nwould confuse the jury if they are first told that they\nmay consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and\nthen the next instruction seems to say they can't?\nMR. FREY: I don't. First of all, I don't\nthink that's what it says, and I don't think it would\nconfuse the jury, and I'm confident that with that\ninstruction, counsel could explain it. But let me stop\nhere, because I know this was something that Justice\nScalia expressed some uncertainty about in the State\nFarm argument, and that the Oregon Supreme Court said\nthey didn't clearly understand.\nTo consider the conduct means to evaluate it\nin connection with assessing the blameworthiness of the\nconduct being punished.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the problem? If\nthe instruction had said that, you would have a very\ndifferent instruction, and I'm bothered by the\ninstruction too for just that reason. It says you may\nconsider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction,\nI would say, \"why? You've just told me I'm not supposed\nto punish them.\"\nMR. FREY: Well, the second part of it is,\nwhat punishment means is what would be done in a class\naction, for instance, to impose punishment for all the\nharm suffered by Oregon smokers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. This is an argument\nyou're making to us, but I don't know how a juror\nis supposed to figure this out.\nMR. FREY: Well, let me say a couple of\nthings about that. First of all, the Oregon Supreme\nCourt did not rely on this aspect. It held that it was\nproper to punish for harm to nonparties. Now this, in\nour view, this instruction, and there's always a danger\nwhen you add words to an instruction that you will add\nsomething that a court will find was incorrect and\ntherefore deny the instruction, even though the essence\nof it was correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the Oregon\nSupreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to\nnonparties? Your brief quotes something to that effect,\nbut -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to\nthe petition. It says, what the Oregon court said is,\nPhilip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State\nacting through a civil jury from using punitive damages\nto punish a defendant for harm to nonparties. The\nOregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it\nin terms of harming particular nonparties, but to\nexposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly\ndisease.\nMR. FREY: Well, I would refer the Court to\npages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court\ndiscusses, comes to its conclusion on this point. And\nit says, the instruction would have prohibited the jury from\npunishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged\nconduct on other persons even if those persons were\nOregonians who were harmed. But on 28(a) it says,\nbecause the proposed jury did not accurately reflect\nthe law, this is not a statement about Philip Morris's\nposition, the trial court did not commit reversible\nerror when it refused to give it. So I think the court\nwas quite clear in saying -- let me complete my answer,\nbecause I think considering it moves the needle along\nthe scale of allowable punishment for the harm to Jesse\nWilliams, but it does not abandon the principle of\nproportionality to that harm, whereas punishing for it\nis what you would do in a class action. You would\npunish for all the harms to all the Oregonians. This is\na one-way class action in which Philip Morris was\nexposed to global punishment by the jury without any of\nthe protections of a class action. So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me -- let me\nfocus the problem that I have right now this way. If\nI look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and\nparticularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21,\nI have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the\nopinion. I read them the same, just what you claimed\nthey were saying. The difficulty that I have is because\nI think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of\nyour client was not a clear instruction, I have great\ndifficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error\nto refuse to give the instruction.\nMR. FREY: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So my problem is, if I\nthink they really did have the wrong view of the law but\nthe issue was focused at the trial court by a request\nfor an instruction which I think was properly denied,\nwhat do I do? Do I concentrate on what they said in the\nopinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the\ndeficiency of the instruction?\nMR. FREY: Well, I think what you do is\ndecide the Federal issue, which I think is whether they\nwere correct in the legal proposition that they\nasserted.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But then they would\nrespond, when they made that, when they gave that\nexplanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were\nresponding to a claim of error which was focused and\nraised at the trial level by the request for an\ninstruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound\ninstruction, an unsound request.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess we could\nleave it up to them whether they want to disallow the\ninstruction for a different reason, but the fact is they\ndisallowed it for the reason that you say.\nMR. FREY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we can say that is\nerror and remand it to them. That might not make you\nvery happy, but it would be up to them whether or not\n--\nMR. FREY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In effect, it would give\nyou another chance in Oregon.\nMR. FREY: But I do want to question the\npremise. First of all, the instruction says basically\nwhat this Court said in BMW, which is where it drew\nprecisely that distinction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was a good thing we\nweren't instructing a jury.\nMR. FREY: Well, I don't think there is --\nthe concept may be abstract, the difference between\nconsidering and punishing, but it's quite clear in this\nCourt's jurisprudence and I think it can be made quite\nclear to the jury with the benefit of the proper\ninstruction, and I don't -- I don't have any --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I do too. I don't have\nany trouble with the distinction.\nMR. FREY: If we had this instruction, if we\nhad this instruction which I believe is correct, there\nis nothing incorrect about this instruction. It is\ncorrect that the jury may consider. We are not\nchallenging that the jury may consider the conduct and\nmay determine that the conduct --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't answer the\nquestion, if the juror were to speak up. It doesn't\nanswer the question. Consider for what? How? Why am I\nsupposed to be considering it when you've just told me\nnot to punish?\nMR. FREY: Well, I think the instruction\nsaid --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Or not punish for other --\nMR. FREY: I think the instruction says that\nyou are to consider it in connection with\ndetermining the reprehensibility of the conduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. If it had said that, I\nwould have no trouble with it. What it says is, you may\nconsider it in determining what the reasonable\nrelationship is between the harm caused to Jesse\nWilliams and the amount of punitive damages assessed. I\ndon't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon\nwhether the punitive damages bear a reasonable\nrelationship to Jesse Williams' harm. That's my problem\nwith it.\nMR. FREY: Well, they do, because conduct\nthat is more blameworthy, in terms of determining, as\nthis Court has said in all its cases, and I know you\ndon't agree with the whole inquiry --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't.\nMR. FREY: But as this Court has made quite\nclear, the reprehensibility of the conduct is an\nimportant factor in determining where along the scale of\nreasonable relationships in a particular case you might,\nthe relationship might be reasonable. So, more conduct\nthat is calculated to harm large numbers of people can\nbe found more blameworthy as to warrant a higher\nproportion, a higher relationship between the punitive\nand compensatory damages.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when you do\nthat, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for\nthe harm to others? You're going to award a higher\nmultiple with respect to the damages --\nMR. FREY: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based on the\nconduct to others. Why wouldn't a normal juror think --\nMR. FREY: I think you are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. Why\nwouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the\ndefendant for the harm to others?\nMR. FREY: Well, I think that the semantical\nquibbling is not something that the jury would have\ndifficulty with, in my opinion. But let me try to\nexplain the difference this way. If you're considering\nthe conduct in relation in determining what is the proper\npunishment for the harm to Jesse Williams, you should come\nup with a number that can be properly replicated in case\nafter case if other juries arrived at the same conclusion\nabout the conduct. If you are punishing for the\nconduct, you should come up with a number that precludes\nfurther punishment for the same, punishing for the harm,\nfurther punishment for the same harm, for the same\ncauses of action for punitive damages that various\nOregonians had. So there's a fundamental difference in\nthat respect between considering and punishing for it,\nand the Court has said repeatedly, and I don't think\nwe can contest this, that the character of the conduct\ncan be considered in determining the proper level or\nallowable level of punitive damages, that included the\ncharacter of the conduct is the intended scope of the\nharm, if it's an isolated incident, if it's a consistent\npattern of misconduct.\nSo, I don't think we could properly have told\nthe jury that they may not consider the conduct without\ngetting ourselves in serious trouble. So -- and I\ndon't, I don't think, and the difference is potentially\nenormous. If you think about a jury that was deciding a\npunitive damages class action and a jury that was told\nthat they had to punish for the harm to the particular\nplaintiff in the, in the particular case, it's, it's\nobvious that the results would be vastly different in\nthose cases. And the problem we were worried about was\nthat the jury would think of itself as the punishment\nagency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to\nall Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Frey, let me\nask you a question. Suppose this was a criminal case\nand the defendant was being punished for crime A and the\njudge in working out the sentence realizes he also\ncommitted crimes B, C, D, and E. He could take those\ninto account in determining the extent of the sentence\ngiven for crime A. Why isn't that similar?\nMR. FREY: It is similar, but what he can't\ndo is punish for crimes B, C, D, and E. Suppose we had\na mail fraud prosecution --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if there was a second\n-- the same defendant got convicted again for crime X.\nAt that sentencing the judge could again take into\naccount the harm to defendants B, C, and D.\nMR. FREY: That's true. That's certainly\ntrue. That's why our point is that it's one thing to\nproduce a punishment that can properly be replicated in\ncase after case without producing an excessive total\npunishment. It's another thing to punish in case after\ncase for the same harms.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not the same harm\nif it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff\nin the second case. You're punishing him for the harm\nto be this time, and you can -- just as in a criminal\ncase, why can't you in both cases take into account\nthat, the harm to the class, to the public at large?\nMR. FREY: If this was a mail fraud\nprosecution for defrauding Jesse Williams into buying\ncigarettes and the punishment was five years for that,\nthe judge could consider in setting the punishment\nbetween zero and five the fact that this was part of a\nscheme that was intended to or may have deceived large\nnumbers of other people in setting the punishment\nbetween zero and five. What the judge cannot do and\nwhat we were worried the jury would do here and what we\nthink the size of its verdict may suggest it actually\ndid here is to think that they could punish it that time\nnot just 5 years, but 10 or 15 or 20 for all of the\nother punishments, for all the other wrongs that they\nfind to have been done.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In that respect, how does\nthe -- there may not be a definitive authority by this.\nOregon says that if a corporation commits\nmanslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount\nthe corporation gained by committing the offense --\nMR. FREY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is my understanding.\nSuppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits\nfive manslaughters. Would they be liable -- and gained\nfor $1 million. Would they be liable for twice a million\ndollars in every manslaughter case?\nMR. FREY: No. But I think the disgorgement\nargument that has been made by the other side suffers\nfrom exactly the same problem as the global punishment\nproblem. That is, you can't -- if you disgorged in\nevery case all the profits that were earned from selling\ncigarettes to Oregonians and to Oregonians became who\nsick --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Frey, we don't\nknow what Oregon law is on that point. They do\nhave a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they\nmust adjust in the next case. And how would you deal --\nwould it be different if Oregon, as many States, said\npart of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff,\nbut to some State fund?\nMR. FREY: I don't, I don't think that --\nour complaint is not that the plaintiff is getting the\nmoney. Our complaint is with how much we're being\npunished and what the procedural regime is that has led\nto punishing us.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the law in Oregon\nwere, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive\ndamages or you can get only the difference between what\nthe jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already\npaid out in punitive damages?\nMR. FREY: Well, first of all, that's not\nthe law in Oregon.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't know what it is.\nWe haven't had the second case.\nMR. FREY: Well, we have no -- well, the\nOregon Supreme Court did not rely on this, on this\nstatute, for purposes of dealing with the harm to\nothers, harm to nonparties problem. The statute does\nnot require giving credit, only consideration. Even if\nit, even if it did, it operates as a one-way ratchet.\nThat is, you keep making awards until you've reached the\nmaximum that would be allowable for all the conduct even\nthough juries, properly instructed, might have awarded\nsubstantially less and even though many juries might\nexonerate the defendant totally, as many juries have in\ntobacco cases. So the Oregon regime is, is a formula\nfor having what amounts to excessive punishment or at\nleast unfair punishment.\nAnd finally, the, the 30.925, which was\nreferred to by the court of appeals, requires submitting\nthis evidence to the jury and, as the trial court said\nin this case at page 195a of the joint appendix, there\nis no telling whether submitting the prior awards to the\njury would produce higher or lower awards in this case.\nSo I think it's an entirely illusory protection to rely\non that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you -- are you\nfinished?\nMR. FREY: Yes. I was going to say that\nbecause our concern is structural with the design of the\nOregon system as it's been approved by the Oregon\nSupreme Court, I don't think this inadequate remedy can\nsave that system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wanted to know what you\nthink about a suggestion that I got from something that\nJustice Scalia said. I don't know whether he was making\nit or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you\nthink. Suppose that this case -- suppose we were to\nsay, there are many issues in this case, some of them\nvery difficult, but one thing we're certain about: You\ncannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause\nin a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from\nthe defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the\npurpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did\nto a different person who wasn't there. Now -- so he\ncouldn't defend against him. That person didn't present\na claim. So we are certain of that.\nNow, we're not certain whether that's what\nhappened here. It may have done. There is certainly a\nlot of language to suggest it, and there is some\nlanguage the other way. So we remand it to the court\nwith that instruction that they cannot permit this to\nhave happened if it happened. Whether it happened and\nwhat happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part\nand things about instructions, etc. Now, what's your\nview of that kind of disposition?\nMR. FREY: Well, I think the first part of\nyour premise is clearly correct and totally consistent\nwith the position we are taking. Whether it happened\nhere or not is an interesting question. It is in the\nnature of a limiting instruction, which was basically\nwhat this was. You can use the evidence for one\npurpose, legitimate purpose, but don't use it for an\nillegitimate purpose. But we can't tell ordinarily,\nbecause jury deliberations are secret and we can't probe\nwhat they have decided, we can't probe whether they have\nimposed global punishment or not.\nBut we anticipate the problem. We proposed\nan instruction which would as best we could at the time\naddress the problem. Maybe it could be edited up to be\na little sharper. But I think it contains the essential\npoint that we're driving at here today.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe, but it's possible\nthe Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are\nperfect, but -- and no set of jury instructions is\nperfect. But if we look at the jury instructions\nwithout the suggested one that was rejected and then we\nlook at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had\nmany things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems,\nconfusion, et cetera. We find the instructions weren't\nperfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the\ntrial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.\nMR. FREY: You're raising a question whether\nthat would be an adequate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. That's what\nworrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as\nwe try to determine what this instruction said, whether\nit was good enough, whether the instructions without it\nare good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog\nof mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State\nlaw, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the\ncontext of the trial, et cetera.\nMR. FREY: Well, I think this is a pretty\nfundamental principle. I believe the instruction fairly\ncaptured it. I don't think there would be an adequate\nand independent State ground for refusing the\ninstruction. Keep in mind that in State Farm the Court\nsaid the defendant upon request would have been entitled\nto an instruction on the subject of extraterritorial\npunishment. Now, this is conceptually not really\ndifferent from extraterritorial punishment. We wouldn't\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frey, I suppose\nyour theory here depends on the nature of the underlying\ntort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses\nthat might be available with respect to other, other\nindividuals who are harmed.\nMR. FREY: Certainly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this argument\nwouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't\nsusceptible to those sorts of defenses.\nMR. FREY: It would still apply because\ndifferent factfinders, different juries, might reach\ndifferent conclusions on the same evidence, assuming\nthat a summary judgment for the plaintiff is not proper.\nWhat you're doing is preempting, you're allowing a\npotentially aberrational verdict, which there could be\nin many cases, to preempt the work of other juries. The\nwhole essence of the idea that we were trying to convey\nhere and the legal principle that we are arguing today\nis to confine the jury to its proper domain and its\ndomain is the case before it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The jury can't really find\nthat other people were harmed. The jury doesn't have\nevidence before it except as to this person. The most\nthe jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the\nactivity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming\nother people. I think a jury could find that. And\ntherefore, the activity is more heinous and should be\npunished more severely. But I -- you don't --\nMR. FREY: Accepting the premise, accepting\nthe premise, we don't disagree with your conclusion.\nThat is, if the jury could find that they could punish\nthis more severely. What they cannot do is punish it\nglobally.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I don't think I'm\nquibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury\ncan decide that other people have been harmed and take\ninto account the harm that it found other people\nsuffered in deciding the penalty. And I don't think\nthis jury has any basis for finding that other people\nwere harmed. It could say there was a serious risk of\nit.\nMR. FREY: It can certainly consider the\nscope of the intended scheme. The fact that it didn't\nhave evidence didn't stop the Oregon Court of Appeals\nfrom finding and the Oregon Supreme Court from endorsing\nthe finding that many Oregonians were deceived, even\nthough --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a distinction\nbetween actual harm to others and the risk of harm?\nSupposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd\nof people.\nMR. FREY: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And he killed one, at\nleast one. And that one sued and said: I want extra\npunitive damages because all these other people were\nsubjected to the same risk. Wouldn't that be a proper\nconsideration?\nMR. FREY: I think it is. I think in TXO\nthe Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be a proper\nconsideration even if a second person brought the same\naction?\nMR. FREY: Well, if there were more, if\nthere were other people who had causes of action, then\nI think there is a problem. In your hypothesis if only\none person is injured --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're not asking to\nrecover for the actual harm to the others. You're\nsaying there was a general risk of harm to many, many\npeople, which is similar to what we have here. We don't\nknow whether they're harmed or not, but that can be\ntaken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict.\nMR. FREY: Well, that's what the Court said\nin BMW in effect, that the jury could consider even out\nof State conduct insofar as it revealed something about\nthe blameworthiness of the defendant's conduct, the\ndefendant's state of mind, the defendant's intentions.\nWe're not saying that these things can't be considered\nfor that purpose. What we are saying is that other\npeople can bring their own lawsuits and punishment in\nthose lawsuits -- If $79.5 million is right for Jesse\nWilliams --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the time to\ndetermine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the\nsecond lawsuit is brought?\nMR. FREY: No, because the problem is a\nproblem with the design. If you punish in the beginning\n-- if you have A, B, C, and D who are potentially\ninjured and you punish in A's case for the harm to B, C,\nand D and then the defendant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But can't I punish for the\nrisk of harm to B, C, and D?\nMR. FREY: Well, if you're punishing for the\nrisk of harm then the same punishment would be\nappropriate in B's case and C's case and D's case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But part of this award,\nat least according to the trial -- there's a footnote\nreferring to an Oregon statute that provides for the\ndistribution of punitive damages between prevailing\nparties and the State of Oregon. Is -- was this award\nshared?\nMR. FREY: Well, it hasn't been paid yet.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But would it be?\nMR. FREY: I think it would be subject to\nthat statute. Now, there's a question whether under the\nmaster settlement agreement it would have to be paid\nback to the companies. But that's a separate question\nthat's not before the Court. But our position --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the State law\nprovides that part of the recovery goes to the State,\nthen at least as to the part that goes to the State you\ncan say, well the State has recovered and you can't --\nMR. FREY: But we have no protection for\nthat. We have no protection. First of all, this\nverdict --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you can object\nin the next case if you're subjected to --\nMR. FREY: And if we win the next case and\nwe win the case after that and we win the case after\nthat, when do we get credit?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I mean when you lose\nthe case on the merits and there's a determination of\ndamages, Oregon says, we adjust for having a prior\naward. We don't know what that adjustment will be.\nMR. FREY: Right, but the regime is flawed\nin its structure because it's a ratchet to get up to the\nhighest possible level even though juries who understood\nthe underlying constitutional principle might award\nless.\nSo I'd like to save, if I may, the balance\nof my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Frey.\nMr. Peck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'll start with the proposed\ninstruction because that is where Philip Morris began\nand the Oregon courts properly treated that as an\nenigma. It told the jury, it would have told the jury,\nboth that they could consider the extent of harm and not\nconsider the extent of harm with respect to a reasonable\nrelationship. That's the disparity guide post.\nClearly, that is not what this Court has said. And\nwhat, it's not what the Oregon Supreme Court did. It's\nalso significant if you look at the actual proposed\ninstruction, which is, starts on page 240, 279(a) of the\njoint appendix, the, the proposed instruction says you\nmay consider whether the imposition of punitive damages\nis necessary to punish and deter similar misconduct by\ndefendant and others in the future. Now, that's part of\na calculation that considers harm to others in the\nfuture as a potential harm. So that is one of the\nthings that the Oregon Supreme Court discussed when it\nsaid that this does not reflect our law.\nIt's also significant that they said that\nyou could consider financial condition and you cannot\nconsider financial condition which is part of the Oregon\nstatute. Now Philip Morris in their reply brief says\nthat we have conflated an alternative instruction with\none that they offered but if you look at page 280(a) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're losing me,\ncounsel. What, what specifically is wrong with the\ninstruction proposed here?\nMR. PECK: This instruction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As briefly as possible,\none, two, three.\nMR. PECK: This instruction basically\nadvises the jury to do precisely what Philip Morris\nargues before this Court it cannot do and that is to\ntake into account the harm suffered by others in\ndetermining this disparity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you object to in\nthis instruction. I mean, and I thought our cases\nclearly established that you can consider the harm to\nothers in assessing the reprehensible nature of the\nconduct. You don't disagree with that?\nMR. PECK: We don't disagree with that and\nthat's precisely what the Oregon Supreme Court did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the other hand,\nyou cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the\ndefendant for those harms particularly in a case where\nthe defendant might have defenses available with respect\nto those others. So I understood what the instruction\nsought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but\nthe reason it's a fine line is because of our prior\ncases, and it tried to draw that distinction between\nassessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to\nothers.\nMR. PECK: We submit that it was\nunsuccessful in conveying properly what this Court has\nheld and that is sufficient grounds for the Oregon\nSupreme Court to uphold the trial court's decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it have been a proper\ninstruction if the second sentence had read, although\nyou may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in\ndetermining what the -- what that reasonable\nrelationship is, although you may consider the extent of\nharm suffered by others in determining how heinous the\ncrime, the action of the defendant was, and hence --\nwhat, what that reasonable relationship is? If you had\njust added in that additional thought.\nMR. PECK: Justice Scalia, if that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that's all\nthat's left out of it. Now does leaving that out of it\nmake it erroneous?\nMR. PECK: Leaving that out made it\nerroneous because it said, not with respect to\nreprehensibility analysis but with respect to reasonable\nrelationship. That was erroneous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes but reprehensibility\nanalysis is part of the reasonable relationship. The\nmore reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be,\naccording to our cases as I understand it.\nMR. PECK: Let me take a step back because I\nthink there is a confusion here over also the word\npunishment. Punitive damages do not punish for harm,\nthey punish misconduct. And this is an important\ndistinction because harm is a compensatory concept. You\ncompensate others for harm and of course you cannot\ncompensate others for harm in the course of this case.\nBut you can consider the potential risks, the potential\nharm and the future harm if this course of misconduct is\nnot deterred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying this\ninstruction was too favorable to you --\nMR. PECK: No, I'm saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it allowed them\nto consider harm.\nMR. PECK: --this instruction -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't think they\nshould have been allowed to consider harm, correct?\nMR. PECK: This instruction as the Oregon\nSupreme Court said, you know, doesn't provide the\nclarity that Philip Morris hoped to provide to the jury.\nAnd it says and they can't see how this summarizes\nPhilip Morris' interpretation of Campbell. That's in\nfootnote 3 of the court's opinion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, why -- why though?\nI'm having the same problem. As I read the sentence\nthat we have just been quoted it seems to me\nat first blush that it's completely right. You may\nconsider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others\nin determining what the reasonable relationship is. Now\nyou have to be sophisticated in this. Don't ask me how\nthe jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that\nthe more severely awful the conduct, the higher the\nratio between the damage award and the injury suffered\nby this victim in court. And if it's really bad, you're\ngoing to maybe have a hundred times this compensation\ninstead of only ten times or five times.\nSo -- we take it into account, the extent of\nthe harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that\nratio should be. That means it goes to the evilness of\nthe conduct. But you are not to punish the defendant\nfor the impact of its alleged misconduct on other\npersons who aren't here in court. In other words, what\nyou aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who\nhas really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in\ncourt, think about her suffering, which is real and\nserious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant\nbecause of what he did to her. Which would be a natural\nhuman reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless,\nthe law is that that's what you're not supposed to do.\nSo reading it as I just read it naturally,\nit seems to describe what our cases have said is the\nlaw. Why isn't that right? I'm looking for a real\nanswer to the question. I'm posing it in a hostile way\nand hope I'll get an answer.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. PECK: Justice Breyer, if the\ninstruction had been given the way you have just stated\nit we would have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I --\nMR. PECK: -- had no problems. But it's not\nhow it reads.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PECK: And it's not what it does. It\nstarts out saying that reasonable relationship is about\nthe harm to Jesse Williams and then it says you may\nconsider the harm suffered by others in determining that\nreasonable relationship. Well, how does harm to others\nhelp you figure out what the relationship to Jesse\nWilliams is? It doesn't compute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, because the\ninstructions indicate and juries often do this that\npunitive damages are certain multiple of the\ncompensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are\nsaying. In determining what that multiple should be you\nconsider whether they have harmed others. And this\ninstruction would make all the difference to the world\nin terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about.\nIf you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say,\nwell, there is however many, a thousand other people in\nthe plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be\nperfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the\nconduct is a thousand times more reprehensible. There\nis a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple\nwhen you get this kind of instruction.\nMR. PECK: But, but juries don't look at\npunitive damages in terms of a multiple. They are not\nasked to multiply anything and they shouldn't be. They\nare looking at the misconduct. They are looking at how\nyou deter others from similar misconduct. They are\nlooking at profitability here which is a statutory\nrequirement to them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, it seems to me the\npoint you're making is not the basis on which the\nSupreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was\nproperly disallowed. The Supreme Court of Oregon said\nit was properly disallowed because you can take into\naccount directly the harm to other people, isn't that\nthe case?\nMR. PECK: That is not the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Why not?\nMR. PECK: As Justice Ginsburg pointed out\nearlier, the citations that they have used in their\nbrief are to the characterization of Philip Morris'\nargument. But if you look at 30(a) in the petition --\nand that second paragraph there starts out with \"using\nharm to others as part of the ratio may have been correct\nunder the plurality opinion in TXO\" --and then you jump\ndown to, \"however, it no longer appears to be\npermissible if it ever was.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what about footnote 3, on\npage 18(a)? On the last sentence says, if the jury cannot\npunish for the conduct which is harming others, then it is\ndifficult to see why it may consider it at all.\nMR. PECK: And that's because of the nature\nof this conduct. This is not conduct that was directed\nat Jesse Williams and he was the sole recipient of what\nPhilip Morris did here. This was a massive market\ndirected fraud driven by their rational and deliberate\ndecisions at the highest levels of the company to\ndeceive customers and knowingly endanger their health.\nThey knew that this would have a special impact on those\nwho are highly addicted, as Jesse Williams was. And so\nthis is the misconduct that Oregon is seeking to deter.\nAnd how is a State, given the considerable flexibility\nthat this Court has recognized, going to deter that kind\nof misconduct if instead society's interest has to be\nfractionalized on an individual case-by-case basis\nknowing that the majority of those cases will never take\nplace and in fact in Oregon will not?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because you read it's about\nharm. You say look here is the person doing something\nabsolutely awful, I mean really awful. And look at how\nawful it is. It's the kind of thing that would have\nhurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them.\nMR. PECK: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now I think we all agree\nthat that's an appropriate thing to say. And as long as\nyou can say that why can't you create serious damages\nfor that type of conduct?\nMR. PECK: Well, that is precisely what we\nbelieve the Oregon Supreme Court did here. When it\ntalked about how highly reprehensible this was,\nextraordinary by any measure, it said those concerns\noverride ratio by which they meant single digit ratios.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say, I mean\nJustice Alito asked you a question about the footnote.\nAnd I, in all candor I think you told us more about the,\nyour case than about the footnote, but let me ask you\nbasically the same question about what the Oregon\nSupreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the\nbottom of 20(a) up to 21. It says \"Philip Morris's\nproposed jury instructions would have prohibited the\njury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its\nalleged misconduct on other persons even if those other\npersons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same\nconduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way.\nAs we noted that is not correct as an independent matter\nof Oregon law,\" and so on.\nThat is not a totally unambiguous statement.\nI will concede that, but isn't the most obvious\nreasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can\npunish for harm to others, so long as those others are\nOregonians and not people in other States?\nMR. PECK: I believe, Justice Souter that\nwhat the court was doing there which is somewhat similar\nto the analysis below in the Oregon Court of Appeals,\nwas to talk about the prospective future victims of this\nfraud, that if it were not deterred which is a\nconsideration that the Oregon statute makes clear, if it\nwas not deterred then this kind of consideration for the\nsame acts having the same effect on others then doesn't\nallow you to make sure that on that scale that this is\nat the high end of what we are --\nJustice SOUTER: That's a, that's a, I will\nassume that's a legitimate reading in your favor. But\nthe answer, I mean, I think the response has to be after\nlistening to you, I don't know. I don't know whether\nthat's what they really had in mind here. And if, if I\nreally can't figure out what they had in mind, and if I\ngo back to the footnote that Justice Alito mentioned\nbefore, isn't perhaps the better, the better course to\nsend this back to them and say, \"We don't know what you\nmean. Were you saying you can punish for these others\nas distinct from considering risk to others for, on\nreprehensibility?\" And let them tell us clearly. Isn't\nthat the better course?\nMR. PECK: Well, you know, perhaps that's\none way to determine what the court meant. But I would\nsuggest --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One way to look at\nwhat it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at\nthe joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel\nin Oregon to the jury: \"How many people do you see\noutside driving home smoking cigarettes?\" Now, that\ntype of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess\nreprehensibility. On the other hand, with the\ninstruction that was offered the defense counsel could\nhave warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for\nthose other people. We only have one plaintiff before\nus and we are assessing the reprehensibility with\nrespect to that plaintiff. But without the instruction\nyou're allowed to argue how many people do you see in\nOregon smoking cigarettes?\nMR. PECK: Let me suggest that both the\nOregon Supreme Court and the instructions that were\nactually given to the jury helped answer this by looking\nat the statutory criteria. Oregon has taken\nextraordinary steps since this Court's decision in Oberg\nto enact a statute that guides the courts on the, guides\nthe juries and the courts in the assessment of punitive\ndamages.\nYou know, first there is a threshold.\nBefore you can even plead punitive damages you must meet\nthat threshold and you must demonstrate to the court by\nadmissible evidence that there was a reckless and\noutrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of\nharm, that they've acted with a conscious indifference\nto the health and safety and welfare of others. Now,\nthis is part of what infuses it with public purpose.\nThen --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask you what\nis the division? How much of this --\nMR. PECK: 60 percent of an award by statute\ngoes to a crime victims fund of the State of Oregon and\nas soon as the judgment is rendered then the State\nbecomes a judgment creditor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That has no\nrelevance to the question of the extent to which the\ndefendant is being punished, does it?\nMR. PECK: No, but the statutory criteria\nwhich requires that the jury find by clear and\nconvincing evidence the following factors, which was\ngiven to this jury in the fashion that I'm about to tell\nyou, constrains this award and I think properly makes it\nreasonable.\nFirst, you have to consider whether there is\na likelihood that serious harm would arise from the\ndefendant's misconduct. Second, the degree of the\ndefendant's awareness of that likelihood. Three,\nprofitability in the State of Oregon. Four, duration of\nthe misconduct and concealment of it. Five, the\nattitude and the conduct of the defendant upon discovery\nof the misconduct. And then finally, financial\ncondition of the defendant, which cuts both ways. It\nprotects a defendant from being bankrupted by punitive\ndamages while at the same time assures that punitive\ndamages are enough to have that deterrent effect.\nNow even after that, the defendant could opt\nto have the jury address whether they had been\npreviously punished for this misconduct or choose not\nto, which you would expect most defendants to choose,\nand instead post verdict, present that to the trial\njudge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The trouble with the more\nbasic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but\nit is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors\nlike that, or many do. Alabama did. You know, not\nquite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you\nknow. And there are other cases that would bring up\nproducts liability. And it's pretty hard to think of a\nproducts liability case where the jury found negligence,\nwhere they might not also find these factors. Because\nin a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the\ncompany. Somebody will have been hurt and likely\nseriously, and when you start thinking about the victim\nin front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often\nis, at least in this instance. And now you read these\nfive factors, and the difficulty for me has always been,\nwell, you read the jury factors like that and they can\ndo almost anything. And it's that, it's that fact that\nanything goes that I found disturbing.\nMR. PECK: But this last factor that I was\nabout to get to, which I think provides a constraint\nthat's unlike the ones that you've seen in other cases,\nand that is the total deterrent effect of other\npunishment imposed in any remedial measures the\ndefendant has taken. Now this can be presented first to\nthe trial judge, saying okay, we have this huge award,\nbut, you know, we have been fined by the government, we\nhave had punitive damages assessed against us in other\ncases, and as a result we have taken the following\nmeasures which assure that we will not engage in this\nkind of misconduct again, and as a result also, this\naward should be cut.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you say this after the\nfact? The jury doesn't hear this?\nMR. PECK: The jury does not. You have the\noption of presenting it to the jury but you do not have\nto present it to the jury. You can present it first to\nthe trial judge and you can also present it at the\nappellate level.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems very odd that a\nmajor argument for constraint is something that the jury\ncan't hear. It just goes to show, really, the\nirrational nature of the exercise.\nMR. PECK: I would suggest it's not\nirrational because what you do is, you've given the\ndefendant the option as a strategic matter either to\npresent it to the jury or if they think that will\nguarantee an award of punitive damages against them,\nthey can withhold it and present it only to the trial\njudge. This is a protection to the defendant rather\nthan, you know, an oddity, I think.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nAssuming there's a distinction, and the instruction\ndoes, between taking into account the extent of harm to\nothers on the one hand and punishing for the extent of\nharm on the other. As I understand what you recited\nabout the five parts of the instructions, none of them\nreally authorized punishment for harm to others.\nMR. PECK: That is correct, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that\nthe part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems\nto me that could be an argument that you should take\ninto account the extent of harm to others, but it does\nnot seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on.\nAnd the question I want to ask, are there other parts\nof the closing argument in which plaintiff's counsel\nargued that you should take into account, that you\nshould punish for harm to others?\nMR. PECK: There is not. The only argument\nthat was made in closing was that you can think about\nthe others, which was clearly intended to go towards\nthat reprehensibility analysis. You know, certainly in\nthe criminal law context, an attempted crime is punished\nas badly as an actual crime when all the elements that\nare required to, to accomplish that crime have occurred.\nAnd in the context of this very unusual long in duration\nmisconduct, what you had to do was you had to look at\nthat broad attempt to effect Oregon --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think juries can,\nOregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what\nthey are told if they are told, you can take into\naccount conduct directed at other people for the purpose\nof assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you\ncan't punish for the harm that is caused other people?\nMR. PECK: I believe they can. This -- this\njury did a very good job. First of all, if they --\nJUSTICE ALITO: They can understand that\ndistinction and --\nMR. PECK: I believe they can.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you would have them\napply that principle in this case?\nMR. PECK: They understood contributory or\ncomparative negligence, and gave no award on the basis\nof negligence. They made a distinction in, in the fraud\nclaim by only awarding a little bit more than $21,000,\neven though the request was much higher.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if they can\nunderstand that distinction, why wasn't the defense\ncounsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you\nargued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing\nreprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say,\nbut, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you\nanswered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that\ndistinction?\nMR. PECK: I believe the defense counsel\nwould have been entitled to make such an argument. I\ndon't think there would have been any need for\ncorrective instruction. But what they proposed, which\nwas conflicting in two different respects, just did not\nmeet the muster.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it\nwould have been, putting aside what they proposed, if\nthey had proposed an instruction that said, you may\nconsider the harm to others in assessing how\nreprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish\nPhilip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had\nno objection to that instruction?\nMR. PECK: I would have had no objection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So your only objection is\nthat they left out the reason why it is relevant to\ndetermining what the ratio should be? They just didn't\nsay you can consider it in connection with\nreprehensibility. Why is that crucial?\nMR. PECK: I think it was critical and of\ncourse, you know, Oregon is entitled to run its court\nsystem as it has for more than 30 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why was it critical?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why was it critical?\nMR. PECK: Why was it corrected?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. Justice Scalia said,\nyou know, they left out this one little bit. Why was\nthat critical? What's the answer.\nMR. PECK: Well, the answer is because,\nagain, it was not directed for the specific purpose for\nwhich harm to others may be considered, and that's in\nthe reprehensibility analysis. There is no disagreement\nbetween the parties on that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying, I think\nyou're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out\nwithout somebody telling them?\nMR. PECK: But what this instruction told\nhim --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that what you're\nsaying?\nMR. PECK: No, I'm not saying that. What\nthe instruction told them is to consider it with respect\nto the reasonable relationship. That means the ratio.\nThat means proportionality. And that would suggest, as\nJustice Stevens suggested, that they might multiply it\nby how many people are out there, because I think this\ninstruction was an enigma and was confusing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Too favorable to you. Too\nfavorable to you again, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PECK: You know, perhaps so. But you\nknow, the fact of the matter is that, you know, we did\nnot advocate that the jury punish for harm to others.\nWe do not believe the Oregon court upheld this judgment\nfor that reason.\nIf I can go on to the, some of the other\npoints that are made by Philip Morris. They talk about\nthis Court's decision in State Farm as if it were\nnothing more than a ratio, so they reduce the decision\nto ratio. They transform the most important indicium,\nreprehensibility, into a subsidiary role in the ratio\nanalysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I make, just to\nget the ground rules here, you're not asking us to\nreconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive\ndamages precedents?\nMR. PECK: No, we are not asking you to do\nthat. We think that this, this judgment is valid under\nthose precedents. They denigrate the State's interest\nwhich this Court has said is the first consideration,\nthe State's interest in deterrence to this\nfractionalized sort of passenger on each individual\nlawsuit, even though the State's interest here when we\nget to the punitive damages phase, it's infused with\npublic purpose, that State interest is in deterring\nmisconduct, not in figuring out how many dollars might\nbe additionally awarded to the plaintiff or even into\nits crime victims fund. It removes the State's\nflexibility and ability to experiment with different\nways to address the concerns that this Court has stated\nwith respect to punitive damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It depends when you say\nsomething about duplicative recoveries, because that\nseems to be a major concern.\nMR. PECK: This total deterrent effect\nrequirement is the key here, that this is a part of a\nState statute that says that to the extent that there\nhad been prior punitive damage awards that have operated\nto affect that deterrence that the State is interested\nin, to the effect that there have been other\npunishments, to the effect that there had been remedial\nmeasures taken to prevent such misconduct again in the\nfuture, then the judge is to reduce this award. The\nOregon Supreme Court has said that this fully addresses\nthe concern with multiple awards, duplicative awards,\nand that authoritative construction by that court\nshould, should weigh heavily with this Court. But at\nthe same time, the fact of the matter is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what if -- your friend\nsays, what if we never get assessed for any other case?\nWhere do we make up this money?\nMR. PECK: Well, you know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose they win every\nother case in Oregon.\nMR. PECK: Well, as a practical matter, they\nhave been, they have lost both, the only two cases that\nhave gone to a trial in Oregon. And as a practical\nmatter, the statute of ultimate repose practically\nprevents any future Oregon plaintiff from bringing such\na lawsuit. They would have to show that they contracted\ncancer or a disease from smoking within the repose\nperiod, which is eight years, if one were filed\ntomorrow, eight years ago, and that indeed that the\nfraud was a substantial factor in contracting that\ndisease. That is what we were put to prove in this\ncase, the relevant date being 1988.\nNow imagine, that window is rapidly closing\non eight years, because it was after this case that\nPhilip Morris decided that they were no longer going to\ndeny that smoking causes cancer and they were no longer\ngoing to deny that nicotine was addictive. So that\nwindow is rapidly closing, and it's highly unlikely that\na smoker can point to eight years ago as the point at\nwhich their cancer basically became active. So as a\npractical matter, there is going to be no awards, future\nawards in Oregon. And as a legal matter, doctrinal\nmatter, I believe that Oregon has taken the step\nnecessary to prevent multiple awards.\nYou know, six States do not permit punitive\ndamages in most instances. Another 20 or so cap\npunitive damages. And then 12, of which Oregon is one,\nhas chosen a method like this to address that\nduplicative award approach. I think that kind of\nexperimentation which is done in good faith, which has\nbeen authoritatively construed by the courts to address\nthis question, is sufficient to address any concerns\nwith due process.\nBut let's, let's remember also, that while\nthe Constitution contains many places where numbers are\nimportant, the President must be 35 years of age, it has\nimplied in other places numbers, like in one person, one\nvote. But the due process clause in its spaciousness\nand majesty doesn't talk about numbers, and that is\nwhere the concern is only about reasonableness. It's\nabout fairness. And here the Oregon legislature,\nsupplemented by the Oregon courts, have taken those\nsteps to properly constrain awards.\nSince the decision in Oberg, there have been\nonly 14 punitive damage decisions in Oregon. Four of\nthem have been overturned entirely by the Oregon Supreme\nCourt, so no punitive damages awarded. There are only\ntwo out of all those awards that exceed single digits,\nand this is one of them. So I think that the courts\nhave done a good job there of trying to address these\nconcerns.\nAnd one of the areas of agreement between\nour opponents and us is that the statement in their\nbrief that, reprehensibility ensures that the greater\nwrong receives the greater punishment. But the regime\nthat they are suggesting, one that has a categorical\nratio limit and atomizes this kind of consideration so\nyou don't look at the broader societal and public\npurpose, that one guarantees a regime of\nunderdeterrence. And Oregon has, as it is their right,\nopted for optimal deterrent effect. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Peck.\nMr. Frey, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. FREY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me, let me start with, let me start with the\nobservation that Mr. Peck has argued as though this was\na class action, as though total deterrence,\ndisgorgement, and all these things were all to be\nachieved in this case, which is the heart of our problem\nhere with the denial of the instruction. He referred to\nthis other case in Oregon, which is the Schwarz case, as\nfinding liability also, but what he didn't mention was\nthat on the issue of the fraud relating, involving the\nrelationship between cancer, between smoking and health,\nthe jury found for the defendant. They found liability\non a different issue, but not on this issue. So it\nhardly proves that we would lose all cases. It's also\ntrue that in that case, where the jury did not\nreceive -- we asked for but we didn't get an instruction\nlike this -- the jury actually came back and said: Does\nour award have to be reasonably related to the injury to\nMrs. Schwarz? And the judge refused to tell them the\nanswer to that. So juries do understand this problem\nand they do think about this problem.\nThe suggestion was made that you can\npresent prior awards to the trial judge. Now, I, I hope\nduring my opening argument I covered the reasons why\nthere's a structural deficiency in the system if the\nsystem even called for getting credit, which the\nstatutes don't require. But you should know that the\nOregon plaintiffs' lawyers have argued that under the\nOregon Constitution it must be presented to the jury or\nis it may not be considered by the court. So while here\nhe wants to assure you that it can be presented to the\ncourt, that's not the position they are taking below.\nOn the question by Justice Souter about\nwhether you should send it back and what the Oregon\nSupreme Court meant by its discussion, if it didn't\nmean what we say it meant they should have reversed\nand said were entitled to the instruction or identified\nsome other reason why we're not entitled to the\ninstruction. Now, there may be some independent State\nground that you're not aware of, but you ought to say\nat a minimum that they were wrong and that a defendant\nin a punitive damages case is entitled to an instruction\nof this general nature, and then we can let the Oregon\ncourts on remand address whether there is some other\nproblem which we frankly don't see, but that would be\nfor them.\nNow, if Mr. Peck is right about the\nnature of the conduct, there should be plenty of\nlawsuits and plenty of liability. If there isn't, the\nCourt can't speculate that we ought to punish Philip\nMorris more in this case because other people are not\nsufficiently aggrieved to sue. That seems to me totally\nimpermissible speculation.\nOn the question of harm versus conduct,\nthe unit of prosecution is the cause of action, so that\nit's not, it's not, you can repeatedly -- in our, in our\nsubmission you can repeatedly punish a defendant for the\nsame conduct, for the impact of the same conduct causing\ninjury to different people. What we are basically\nsaying is that there are, there are potentially many\ncauses of action out there for this conduct and the\npunishment in this case should be limited to the cause\nof action that is being tried before the jury in this\ncase.\nLet's see if I -- if I have anything\nelse. Justice Stevens talked about the ambiguity of the\nclosing argument and I agree it's not clear what\nplaintiff's counsel was exactly saying. It could be\ninterpreted in different ways. But that is a reason to\nhave a cautionary instruction, not a reason to forgo\none, to make sure the jury understands the applicable\nprinciples.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Frey.\n"
