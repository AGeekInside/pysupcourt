        "content": "(10:00 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear reargument\nthis morning in Hudson v. Michigan.\nMr. Moran.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor centuries the knock and announce rule has\nbeen a core part of the right of the people to be\nsecure in their houses from unreasonable searches and\nseizures. It reflects the notion that when the\ngovernment has the right to enter a house, whether to\nperform an arrest, to search for evidence, or to seize\ngoods, that the people should have the right to answer\nthe door in a dignified manner, except in an emergency,\nand to avoid the unnecessarily gratuitous embarrassment\nand shock that often follows a precipitous police\nentry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So wouldn't it be\nmore accurate to say that it's protected the right to\nbe free from unreasonable entry as opposed to\nunreasonable search and seizure?\nMR. MORAN: Well, this Court has recognized\nin Wilson, consistent with the common law authorities,\nMr. Chief Justice, that they are connected, that the\nentry directly affects the reasonableness of the search\nand seizure that occurs within. And that's why this\nCourt in Miller and in Sabbath suppressed the evidence\nfollowing knock and announce violations. But in\nWilson, this Court directly stated that the common law,\nthe Fourth Amendment, -- the common law that informs\nthe Fourth Amendment, directly demonstrates that the\nFramers thought that the method of entry directly\naffects whether a search or seizure inside a home is\nreasonable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so in your view,\nthere has to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complex\nfinancial records, business documents. There's a\nwarrant. The search is otherwise proper. They forget\nto knock. They say, oh, you know, we are police\nofficers. There's a discussion for a while. But --\nanything seized after that is -- must be suppressed.\nMR. MORAN: If there is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It just seems to me in the\nhypothetical I put -- and there's obviously a reason I\nput it -- is there's just no causal link between the --\nthe suppression and -- and the failure to knock.\nMR. MORAN: Your Honor, the evidence inside\n-- the evidence is seized inside. The seizure of the\nevidence inside is directly related to the manner of\nentry, just as there's a direct causal link between\nwhen the officers come in without a warrant when they\nshould have gotten a warrant first. They thought there\nwas an exigent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you say directly\nrelated. That -- that assumes the very point that I\nhave in mind. I don't know why it's directly related.\nMR. MORAN: Well, going back to Wilson, this\nCourt said in Wilson, if I might quote from Wilson,\nthat the -- the common law search and seizure leaves no\ndoubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling\nmay depend in part on whether law enforcement officers\nannounce their presence and authority prior to\nentering.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It depends -- it depends in\npart.\nMR. MORAN: It depends in part, certainly.\nThere are other factors as well, but the reasonableness\nof the search depends in part.\nThe issue --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what -- what do you\ndo with our opinion in -- in 1986 in Segura v. United\nStates, which seems to me to contradict your assertion\nthat you cannot separate, for purposes of the\nexclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search?\nIn that case, the -- the policemen entered without a\nsearch warrant. So the entry was clearly a violation.\nThey left two officers in the room and other officers\nwent back and got a search warrant. When they returned\nwith the search warrant, the two officers who were in\nthe room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the\nevidence. It seems to me that in that case, we -- we\ndid succeed in -- in separating the -- the entry from\nthe subsequent search, and I don't know why -- why we\ncan't do the same thing here.\nMR. MORAN: Because there were exceptional\ncircumstances, Justice Scalia, in Segura.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what were the\nexceptional circumstances?\nMR. MORAN: A 19-hour delay and a warrant\nthat was obtained that had nothing to do with the\ninitial entry. That was in no way dependent on the\ninitial entry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're still, it would seem\nto me -- I don't know -- the warrant wasn't dependent\non the initial entry? You could also say the initial\nentry wasn't the product of the -- of the later\nwarrant.\nMR. MORAN: The initial entry was not the\nproduct of the later warrant, but once this Court ruled\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore was unlawful.\nMR. MORAN: That's right. The -- the initial\nentry wasn't lawful.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we didn't hold -- but we\ndidn't hold that.\nMR. MORAN: Well, but this -- the Government\nin Segura never contested the fact that the evidence\nthat was seen and seized during the initial entry\nshould be suppressed. And that's all we're asking for\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me? No, I don't\nunderstand that.\nMR. MORAN: When the officers went in\ninitially in Segura, some evidence was seen and seized\nat that time, and the Government did not contest that\nthat evidence should not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm talking about only\nthe evidence that -- that was the product of the search\nconducted after the warrant was delivered.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that evidence was\nadmitted in.\nMR. MORAN: Right, but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the entry of\nthose officers was an unlawful entry.\nMR. MORAN: The entry -- the initial entry\nwas an unlawful entry. When they came back with the\nwarrant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, no. The -- there\nwas no subsequent entry. You said the initial entry\nwas unlawful. Those officers stayed there. Their\npresence there was the product of an unlawful entry.\nMR. MORAN: Their presence was, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Their presence was the\nproduct of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we\nadmitted in the -- the material that they obtained in\nthe search after a warrant had been obtained.\nMR. MORAN: I -- I read Segura as saying that\nthe presence -- the later presence of the warrant,\nwhich was in no way tainted by the initial entry, made\nthe officers' presence in the home retroactively lawful\nfrom that point. It was unlawful until that point,\nwhich is why the Government did not contest the -- the\npoint that all the evidence that was seized during the\ninitial entry up to the point when the warrant was\nissued had to be suppressed. That's all we're asking\nfor here.\nI can imagine hypotheticals in which you have\na knock and announce violation and then something\nhappens like in Segura or like in Murray, where you\nhave later action that creates an independent source.\nBut in your typical --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- suppose the\nofficer -- excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we are\npolice officers. We do have a warrant. We're going to\nproceed with a search. Please don't be alarmed. We're\ngoing to -- does that do it?\nMR. MORAN: That might do it. That would be\na different case than the case we have here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but your -- your\npoint is -- is there -- is that they have to go out and\ncome back in again.\nMR. MORAN: You would have to create some\nsort of analogy to Murray and Segura. Murray and\nSegura are exceptional cases. There are very rare\ncases when the Government breaks in and then realizes\nwe shouldn't have done that. We should go get a\nwarrant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree. Segura -- I\nforget what it is in torts. It's kind of a\nsupervening, independent cause or something like that.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. Yes. And -- and you can\nhave -- imagine such hypotheticals in the knock and\nannounce context. And in the Moreno case in the Ninth\nCircuit, you have one where you have a knock and\nannounce violation committed in the outer door. No\nevidence is found in the outer door, but then the\nofficers properly knock and announce at the inner door,\nand the Court in the Ninth Circuit held that that was\nproper to seize that. We have no problem with that.\nThat -- that seems like a proper result because\nultimately the purposes of the knock and announce rule\nwere vindicated when the officers knocked and announced\nat the inner door before -- before forcing entry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moran, how -- how\nlong do you think the officers had to wait before they\ncould have entered?\nMR. MORAN: In this case?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: From Banks, somewhere closer to\n15 seconds. 15 to 20 seconds was considered --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would -- if they\nhad done that, what would have been different from what\nhappened in this case?\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Hudson presumably would have\ngotten up from his chair, would have come to the door,\nwould have admitted the officers, and then after --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you presume\nthat? Someone sitting in a chair with gun -- with a\ngun and the drugs you say would have gotten up and\nsaid, oh, it's the police. Let's see what they want?\nMR. MORAN: We presume that people act\nlawfully in response to commands from the police. We\ndo not presume that people will act unlawfully. If the\npolice have evidence or information that someone will,\nin fact, act unlawfully by trying to dispose the\nevidence or by --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't a good sign of\nwhat might have happened what actually happened when\nthe police came in, which was there was an effort to\nhide the evidence?\nMR. MORAN: The record does not disclose any\neffort on Mr. Hudson's part to hide any evidence, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- where --\nwhere were the drugs found?\nMR. MORAN: The rocks of crack cocaine, for\nwhich he was convicted, were found in his left front\npants pocket.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where was the gun\nfound?\nMR. MORAN: The gun was in the chair.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the chair?\nMR. MORAN: In the chair. There was no\nevidence that there was any secreting of evidence in\nthis case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any reason\nto suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds\ninstead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found\nthe same evidence?\nMR. MORAN: It's always possible, Your Honor,\nbut we don't presume that. Just as in Segura, the\nCourt said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the only -- the\nonly reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence,\nI take it, is if they -- if -- if the defendants had\nhad additional time to dispose of it.\nMR. MORAN: We don't contest that they would\nhave found the same evidence, no. We do not argue that\nMr. Hudson or any of the other people in the house\nwould have destroyed the evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is --\nMR. MORAN: We certainly don't make that\nargument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is in the chair the same\nthing as on the chair?\nMR. MORAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You tell me something is in\nthe chair. Did they stuff it -- stuff it in the\ncushion or what?\nMR. MORAN: It's not really clear from the\nrecord, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, inside it --\nMR. MORAN: It's in -- in the chair.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's pretty clear\nyou don't talk of something as being in the chair.\nIt's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair. I\nassume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.\nMR. MORAN: I'm not completely clear exactly\nwhere in the chair it was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: English is English. You\nsaid it was in the chair.\nMR. MORAN: In the chair.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. MORAN: 49 of the 50 States currently\nsuppress evidence following knock and announce\nviolations, just as this Court did in -- in Miller and\nSabbath.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you think is\nthe standard for determining what sort of causal\nconnection there has to be in order to have suppression\nhere?\nMR. MORAN: We go back to the Wong Sun fruits\ntest. Is the evidence that was recovered the direct\nfruit of the violation? In other words, is there a\nclear, logical connection? Now, my opponent --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the purpose of the\ncausal connection requirement? What's the reason for\nhaving it?\nMR. MORAN: Well, it's so -- it's so that\nthere is a -- an obvious connection. Before the court\ntakes the step of -- of excluding evidence, there\nshould be some connection, some clear connection,\nbetween the violation and the evidence recovered. But\nmy --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what's the reason for\nrequiring a clear connection?\nMR. MORAN: I suppose that it's simply the\nmatter of logic, that evidence that's completely\nunrelated to a violation nobody would think should be\n-- should be excluded. But evidence --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But why?\nMR. MORAN: Well, it's -- it's unrelated. So\nif, for example, the police break into my house and --\nand find evidence -- find nothing in my house -- they\nillegally break into my house, but then they -- they do\na proper warrant search of my office and find evidence,\nI -- I don't -- I don't see any connection between the\nillegal search of my house and the legal search of my\noffice, assuming that it was not the fruit of the\nillegal search of my house.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But why? Isn't the reason\njust a -- just a question of crafting an appropriate\nremedy for -- an appropriate deterrence --\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- for violations?\nMR. MORAN: Exactly. It -- the whole point\nis deterrence. And so you wouldn't deter the officers\nwho illegally broke into my house by excluding the\nevidence from my office if -- if -- it may even well be\ndifferent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure you would. Sure you\nwould.\nMR. MORAN: Well, it may well even be a\ndifferent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you'd deterred him\nmore if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do\nthat.\nMR. MORAN: No, we don't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: We -- we limit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we insist that\nthe deterrence somehow be related --\nMR. MORAN: We do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to the -- and -- and the\nrelated usually means that the acquisition of the\nevidence was the product of the violation. It was\ncaused by the violation. And -- and for that reason,\nwe keep it out.\nAnd here, it's -- it's hard to say that this\nwas caused by the fact that they -- that they entered\nin a few seconds too soon. So he would have answered\nthe door and they would have seen the stuff.\nMR. MORAN: What the knock and announce\nviolation causes, Justice Scalia, is the officer to be\nillegally in the home. Going back to the common law\nauthorities, the courts have long recognized --\nAmerican courts have long recognized that an officer\nwho illegally enters a home, even with a valid writ or\na valid piece of paper allowing him to be in the home,\nif the manner of entry is illegal, he is a trespasser.\nHis entry is -- is void ab initio. And so in that\nsense, the entry is the cause of the illegal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Although you say it can be\nretroactively validated.\nMR. MORAN: After Segura --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, in Segura, you can\nretroactively validate it by -- by getting a warrant\nafterwards.\nCould it be -- have been retroactively\nvalidated by knocking and announcing afterwards? I'm\n-- I'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back to\nthe door and they knock and announce and wait -- wait\n10 seconds.\nMR. MORAN: Again, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would that do the job?\nMR. MORAN: I concede that it's possible that\nyou can come up with a Segura-type hypothetical. I\nthink the easiest one is the Moreno case from the Ninth\nCircuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The hypothetical sounds\nridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of\nSegura, that -- that it was somehow a retroactive\nvalidation.\nMR. MORAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. I have laryngitis.\nCan you hear me all right?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, I can, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is it retroactive\nvalidation? I would have thought Segura and those\ncases are Silverthorne cases.\nMR. MORAN: It is. It's an --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that it is is it's an\nindependent chain of events.\nMR. MORAN: It's an independent source.\nJUSTICE BREYER: An independent chain of\nevents that almost certainly would have led to the\ndiscovery of the evidence despite -- not without --\ndespite the unlawful entry. And if that's so, all we\nhave is a -- is a set of cases where deterrence is most\nunlikely to play any significant role because no\npoliceman could possibly count on that kind of thing\ngetting the evidence in --\nMR. MORAN: And that's exactly right. And --\nand the situation we have in Michigan now is that\nofficers know to a certainty that if they violate the\nknock and announce rule, nothing will happen. And so\nthat's why in all the other States --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true.\nThere are cases where the violation of the knock and\nannounce rule gives rise to evidence that may be\nadmitted and that would presumably be excluded if you\ncan show that the seizure is related to the violation.\nThe problem here is that the evidence that is being\nsuppressed, as -- as you've suggested, that there's no\nquestion that it would have been available if the\nofficers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, none of the\nparties has been able to identify any cases in which\nyou can point to evidence and say this -- this evidence\nwas produced by the knock and announce violation and\nnothing else in the house --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Solicitor General\nhypothesized one in the amicus briefs. If somebody --\nyou know, they -- they burst in and someone screams,\nyou know, run away, it's the police, that excited\nutterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce\nwould presumably be related to the violation and could\nbe suppressed. That doesn't mean that the gun and the\ndrugs that are found in the room is in the same\ncategory.\nMR. MORAN: If I may make two responses to\nthat. First, the Solicitor General hypothesized such a\ncase but has not identified a single case where that's\never happened. It's purely hypothetical.\nBut the second point is that excluding that\nevidence would have no deterrent effect whatsoever\nbecause by -- by definition, that's evidence that the\npolice would only get by committing the knock and\nannounce violation. So the police lose nothing by\nrisking the possibility that somebody will make an\nexcited utterance and then say, okay, we won't get to\nuse that excited utterance, but we would never have\ngotten that excited utterance in the first place.\nThat's not deterrence, Mr. Chief Justice. That's\nrestitution. That's like saying that I can be deterred\nfrom stealing something by being told that if I'm\ncaught, I'll have to give it back.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it is is\nrecognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal\nact, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the\nillegal act. What it's saying is that not everything\nthat happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the\nillegal act.\nMR. MORAN: I think your question, Mr. Chief\nJustice, really goes to the worst position language in\nNix, and the point is, from our brief, is that this\nCourt has placed the prosecution in the worst position\nthan it would have been had the police acted lawfully\ndozens, possibly scores, of time -- times.\nAll the cases in which the Court has noted\nthat the police easily could have obtained a warrant.\nMost recently in Georgia v. Randolph, where this Court\nnoted that there were two lawful methods for the police\nto get the cocaine -- the cocaine residue on the straw,\nbut still suppressed the evidence. The police and the\nprosecution do get placed in a worse position, and\nthat's necessary for deterrence. What --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it have been\npossible for these police to get a no-knock warrant?\nMR. MORAN: It might well have been. I was\nasked this question last time, Justice Ginsburg, and\nI'd like to modify my answer. In Michigan, there is no\nstatute governing no-knock warrants, and there's --\nthere are also no court decisions governing no-knock\nwarrants. And there never will be under the People v.\nStevens regime.\nOne of the nice things that's happened in --\nin -- since Wilson v. Arkansas, in fact, before Wilson\nv. Arkansas in many States, is courts have developed --\ndeveloped procedures for police officers to get no-\nknock warrants, to go to the police and ask for a no-\nknock warrant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about in this\ncase, which is Justice Ginsburg's question? If the\npolice said, we have reasonable grounds to -- to\nbelieve that he has a weapon and we're also looking for\ndrugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds\nfor knocking -- for not -- for dispensing with the\nknock requirement?\nMR. MORAN: Could the -- could a judge have\nissued such a warrant in Michigan? Is that your\nquestion?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's take it step by\nstep. Suppose the police articulate this at the outset\n--\nMR. MORAN: It could well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and under -- under State\nprocedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spot\njudgment. Would that -- would those facts suffice to\nallow them to enter without the knock?\nMR. MORAN: If they had specific information\nalong those lines, that -- that there was evidence\nhidden in places or -- or stored in places where it\ncould easily be disposed --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is that correct? I\nthought in most States, there had to be a statute that\nauthorizes a non-knock warrant.\nMR. MORAN: In most States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that most States do\nhave such statutes. And we had this case because\nMichigan chooses to go on -- on a separate path.\nMR. MORAN: Most States do have statutes, but\na few States by court decision have allowed for the\nissuance of no-knock warrants. My point --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even -- even if Michigan\ndoesn't, I mean, that has nothing -- as I understand\nit, that -- that doesn't affect the -- the answer to\nthe Federal question that we have because, as I\nunderstand it, we -- we can -- we can take as good law\nthat even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock\nauthorization, if the police have a justification for\ngoing in without knocking, so far as the Fourth\nAmendment is concerned, the search is still good.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that correct?\nMR. MORAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So what we're really arguing\nis what -- what is Michigan law on the subject, but the\n-- the issue we've got is not Michigan law.\nMR. MORAN: That's right. And this case\ncomes to us in the posture in which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a -- this is a\nplace -- a case in which the warrant was for drugs. Is\nthat not so?\nMR. MORAN: It was.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so in -- in this\ncase, they could have entered in your view if they had\nspecific knowledge of the gun and disposable\ncontraband.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, after Banks and -- and\nRichards, especially Richards, if the police had\nreasonable suspicion that you had contraband in a\nposition where it could be easily disposed and if they\nhad information about the weapons that could be used to\nresist the police entry, then yes, there could have\nbeen a -- a legal no-knock entry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about just the former\nwithout the latter? I thought the former alone would\nbe enough.\nMR. MORAN: Either would be. That's correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to my question,\nisn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the\npolice experience in case after case, that where there\n-- where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and\nthere is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply\nsay this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't\nneed to knock and announce because those circumstances\nwill be present in most cases?\nMR. MORAN: No, because this Court\nunanimously foreclosed that argument in Richards v.\nWisconsin by holding that there must be a\nparticularized showing for the particular case. That\nparticularized showing I will gladly concede will be\neasier to make in a narcotics case than it would be in\na -- in a stolen property case.\nBut it wasn't made in this case, and this\ncase comes to this Court on the posture that the\nprosecution has conceded, at every step of the way,\nthat that particularized showing was not made here and\nthat, therefore, there was a knock and announce\nviolation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. A\nparticularized showing of what?\nMR. MORAN: That in this particular case,\nit's likely that the drugs would be in an easily\ndisposable situation and that the occupants would be\narmed and ready to resist the police entry. And there\nwas no such showing made here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --\nMR. MORAN: The prosecution didn't even\nattempt to make such a showing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm vaguely recalling\ncases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuit\nthat accepted a presumption that if there are drugs\naround, there are likely to be firearms around. Are\nyou saying that that's inconsistent with the Richards\ndecision?\nMR. MORAN: That might not be inconsistent,\nbut the -- the -- to follow that up with, therefore,\nyou can do a no-knock entry automatically is\ninconsistent with the Richards decision.\nThe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nAs I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation\nof the knock and announce rule.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just wondering. In\nMichigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the\nprosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation\nbecause there's no point in litigating it I suppose?\nMR. MORAN: Well, I don't even think we get\nthat far, Justice Stevens. Motions to suppress aren't\nfiled. There's no point filing a motion to suppress\nexcept for the -- the fact that this case is pending in\nthis Court. There's no point for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that if the issue\narises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say,\nyes, we'll assume there was a violation. There would\nbe no reason not to assume that.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you'll never really\nlitigate in Michigan how far they can go before they\nviolate the rule.\nMR. MORAN: It's a dead letter in Michigan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I assume that lawsuits\nare allowable if -- if knock and announce is -- is not\nobserved, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of\nundress.\nMR. MORAN: Michigan --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't a civil lawsuit\nbringable?\nMR. MORAN: Michigan has a particularly\nvigorous State immunity statute that makes it\neffectively impossible to sue for a -- a knock and\nannounce violation. I have not found a single Michigan\ncase in which anyone has successfully sued for a knock\nand announce violation.\nYou can sue in Federal court under section\n1983, but there you run into various doctrines,\nespecially including qualified immunity.\nI made the claim the first time and it still\nhasn't been contradicted by my opponents. We've not\nbeen able to find any cases, published or unpublished,\nin which anyone has collected anything other than\nnominal damages anywhere in the United States --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those doctrines\nthat you're talking about would be overridden on the\nhypothetical that you want us to be concerned about.\nIn other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the\nevidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply\nwith the law. So they're going to deliberately violate\nthe law. Well, if they're deliberately violating the\nlaw, qualified immunity isn't going to help them very\nmuch.\nMR. MORAN: Qualified immunity would still\nprotect them to the extent that any reasonable officer\ncould have thought that a -- a no-knock entry was\nvalid. I cited a number of cases, for example, where\ninnocent people have been shot following entries into\nwrong doors, and qualified immunity has been granted to\nthe officers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. The\ngovernment is not arguing here that -- that it's valid.\nIt's just arguing that though it is invalid, the\npunishment for it should not be to let the criminal go.\nThat's -- that's all they're saying.\nMR. MORAN: That -- that is their argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The punishment for the\ninvalidity should not be the -- the inadmissibility of\nall of the evidence of the crime that was found.\nMR. MORAN: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's quite different\nfrom saying that it's -- that it's valid. So I think\nthey acknowledge that -- that a lawsuit against an\nofficer who knowingly dispenses with -- with knock and\nannounce because, as you say, he says there's --\nthere's no consequence, but there is a consequence. He\ncan be sued.\nMR. MORAN: I assume --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes he may be\ngoing into the wrong house and the person suing him may\nnot be a criminal, but may be some -- some innocent --\ninnocent bystander.\nAnd -- and what about -- you know, you say\nthere's no incentive to knock and announce. There --\nthere may -- you don't know any Michigan cases in which\na -- a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous\ncases in which police who -- who burst in without\nknocking and announcing expose themselves to danger,\nthat is, to being shot at by a -- by a householder who\ndoesn't know that they are the police. Isn't that\nenough of -- of an incentive, the fact that you may\nlose your life?\nMR. MORAN: No, Your Honor, because I think\nwhat some officers will do is exactly what Officer Good\ndid in this case, which is shout police and then burst\nin immediately. So they'll do the announce part, which\nprotects the police, to some extent, from being shot,\nbut they will skip the rest of the knock and announce\nrequirement, which is to wait some reasonable amount of\ntime to allow the householder to make himself more\ndignified, to get to the door, to answer the door, to\nadmit the police in a dignified manner.\nYou raise the point that lots of innocent\npeople are subject to search warrants. Thousands of\ncases every year of -- of people who didn't do anything\neither --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think you said the --\nyou thought the police here had to wait what? 15\nseconds? What was the figure you gave?\nMR. MORAN: Well, from Banks, this Court\nruled that 15 seconds -- 15 to 20 seconds was an\nappropriate time for a drug search.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And now suppose they waited 10\nseconds. And so there would be a -- a constitutional\nviolation? Why would suppression be appropriate in\nthat situation? Why would it be in any way\nproportional to the -- to the violation that occurred?\nMR. MORAN: Well, if it was 10 seconds,\nJustice Alito, the government still might have an\nargument. 15 seconds was enough in Banks. The Court\ndid not say --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, wherever the line is,\nsuppose they're just -- they're just slightly on the\nwrong side of the line?\nMR. MORAN: I think as a practical matter,\nthat if the police are just very slightly on the wrong\nside of the line, the courts are not likely to hold\nthat there was a knock and announce violation. But\nwhen you have a flagrant violation like here --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then you're -- you're\ncontradicting the premise.\nMR. MORAN: Well, in a case like -- in a --\nif a court were to hold that the police did violate the\nknock and announce requirement by coming in -- by\ncoming in, by not giving the person a reasonable amount\nof time to come to the door or to make himself\npresentable, then yes, the evidence should be\nsuppressed because those officers need to be deterred.\nThe -- the exclusionary rule is all about deterrence,\nand is there any method that will deter officers from\nviolating the knock and announce requirement other than\nexcluding the evidence by teaching them through example\nthat next time you need to wait longer? You need to\nwait a reasonable amount of time for someone to come to\nthe door unless you have facts suggesting that waiting\na reasonable amount of time would defeat the purposes\nof the search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- you talk about\ndeterrence. What about their not getting promoted? I\nassume that -- that police departments, even if you\nhave some maverick officers, that the administration of\nthe police department teaches them that they have to\nknock and announce. Or if it doesn't teach them that,\nthen you do have a 1983 cause of action against the\ncity, not just the officers. And that -- you know,\nthat's a deep pocket.\nMR. MORAN: I very seriously doubt officers\nsuch as Officer Good will not be promoted because of\nthe violation that he committed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Really?\nMR. MORAN: -- in a case like this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you know, I'm the\npolice commissioner and I have a policy that you -- you\nobey the law, you knock and announce, and -- and I know\nthat this particular officer disregards it all the\ntime. You really think that's not going to go in his\nrecord?\nMR. MORAN: I do, Justice Scalia, and I think\nit's inconsistent with Mapp in which the Court\nrecognized that other remedies have proven completely\nfutile in enforcing the -- the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mapp was a long time ago.\nIt was before 1983 was being used, wasn't it?\nMR. MORAN: It was before 1983 was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You bet you.\nMR. MORAN: -- being used. But I don't think\nsection 1983 has changed the landscape here. I -- I\ndon't think Mapp is ripe for overruling, and in fact,\nthe Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, one of the amici\nfor the other side, concedes that tort remedies cannot,\nat this time, substitute for the exclusionary rule.\nIf there are no other question, I'll reserve\nthe balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Moran.\nMr. Baughman, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Robert Jackson once said that when he\nwas arguing cases before the Court, he always gave\nthree arguments: the well-structured argument he\nrehearsed, the disjointed and confused argument he\ndelivered to the Court, and the brilliant argument he\nthought of in the car on the way home. I have the rare\nopportunity to deliver the argument I thought of in the\ncar on the way home.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAUGHMAN: But I'm going to refrain,\nmindful of the fact that this is our -- our second time\nthrough and try to hone in on -- on what I think are\nsome critical points.\nA search warrant, a judicial command, must be\nobtained from a neutral and detached magistrate. It\nmust particularly describe the place to be searched and\nthe things to be seized, and it must be issued based on\nprobable cause drawn from information which is sworn to\nare affirmed -- or affirmed. If these requirements are\nmet, the privacy of the described premises will be\ninvaded, and any privilege the occupants might have to\nwithhold evidence or contraband from the police is\nabrogated.\nBut that command must be executed in a\nreasonable fashion. And so the police may not bring\nthird parties into the premises who are unnecessary to\nthe execution of the warrant. They may not search in\nplaces where the items described may not be found.\nThey may not cause unnecessary damage to property, and\nthey may not use force to accomplish the entry unless\nconsent to enter is denied either explicitly or\nimplicitly or unless entering immediately is reasonable\nunder the circumstances to avoid the destruction of the\nevidence or harm to the officers.\nIf no valid warrant exists in the first\nplace, then -- and no exception exists, then the\nprivacy of the dwelling has been unlawfully invaded.\nIt never should have happened. But if a valid warrant\nexists and some error occurs in its execution, it is\nnot the invasion of privacy which should not have\noccurred that is commanded by the warrant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you -- you concede that\nthere was error in execution here? You concede that\nthere was a violation because -- technically because\nthere was no knock?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you concede that?\nYou've got a case in which, as I understand it, not\nonly was the evidence but the warrant itself an\nindication not only that drugs were present, but that\nguns were present. It's perfectly true we don't have a\ngeneral rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can\ndo a no-knock, but in this case you had specific\nevidence that there were firearms there. And based on\nwhat I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan\ndid not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in\nwithout knocking.\nAnd I'll be candid to say you -- to tell you\nthat the fact that Michigan does not make that argument\nsuggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a\ncase in which it's going to have the best shot to -- to\nget the exclusionary rule out of the way here. Why\ndon't you claim that the search was lawful?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let me first say this\ncase was not structured to try -- to try to -- to get\nit here on our -- on our part. I think initially the\nprosecutor handling the hearing here reached the\nconclusion that Richards precluded an argument that a\nno -- that the failure to knock and announce was\njustified here. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Richards precluded a\ngeneral rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing\nin a specific case, and it's the fact that the\nprosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you\ndo not argue that is -- is what I don't understand.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, again, I -- I think it\nwould be an interesting argument to revisit Richards on\nthis proposition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't think we have to\nrevisit Richards. I -- I think what -- what I'm --\nwhat I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument\nbased on the evidence in this case that you had\nprobable cause to believe that there were going to be\nguns facing you when -- when you went in the door and\ntherefore the knock was not required.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Again, I think the -- the\nbelief of the prosecutors, as the case went forward,\nwas that because that belief, the -- you're correct.\nGuns were described as things to be seized in the\nwarrant. The probable cause for that was not any\nspecific knowledge about a gun in the house. It was\nthe officer's general experience that when I execute\nsearch warrants for drugs, guns tend to be there.\nRichards seems to say, at least it certainly could be\nargued, that's not sufficient. You can't make that\ndecision based on experience that drugs and guns go\ntogether.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you suggesting --\ndid -- did the warrant -- I don't know this. I should\nbut I don't. Did the warrant authorize seizure of guns\nas well as --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, it did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- drugs? Well, are you\nsuggesting that the -- the gun portion of the\nauthorization was, in fact, invalid?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No. I -- I don't because I\nbelieve probable cause can be based on the experience\nof officers --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- without specific knowledge\nof the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- so -- in any case, at\n-- at the moment that you got the warrant, you -- you\nhad, in fact, a -- a finding by a trial court, or a --\nwhoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was\nprobable cause to believe that you were going to\nconfront guns as well as drugs inside. And -- and\nRichards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under\nthose circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a\nbasis for -- for dispensing with the knock.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It may not have been a good\nreason, but it was the reason in that the prosecutors\nbelieved that the rejection of the drugs and guns\nalways go together as a justifying -- not knocking\nand announcing in Richards meant that the determination\nin this case that guns were on the premises based on\nthe officer's experience that drugs and guns go\ntogether, not any specific knowledge about a gun was\ninadequate then to forgive knocking and announcing.\nThat may have been a misjudgment, but it was a belief\nthat Richards foreclosed that. It was not an attempt\nto set the case up. We had the Stevens case in\nMichigan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, do you think\njust as an empirical matter that in most cases where\nthere's known to be guns plus drugs, the police will\nenter without knocking?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No. I -- I don't believe\nthat's the case. I think if there's specific knowledge\nthat there are guns on the premises, yes, absolutely.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There's -- there's specific\nknowledge.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. If they knew -- I think\nthen they would enter without knocking. If -- if the\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There was specific knowledge\nhere.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, no, it's knowledge based\non experience.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you got a -- you got a\nwarrant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's in the warrant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that said look for them.\nThat's about as specific as you can get.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I understand but the facts in\nthe affidavit justifying looking for guns was in my\nexperience drugs and guns go together.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can't have it both\nways.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, nevertheless, was not\nthere a finding that there was probable cause that\nthere was a gun there?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I would be happy to -- to, in\na different case, make the argument that although\nRichards says a court cannot say that knock and\nannounce is forgiven every time a drug warrant is\nexecuted on the theory that experience teaches that\ndrugs and guns go together. I'd be happy to argue that\nthat holding does not apply when a judge determines, in\nissuing the warrant, that drugs and guns go together,\nso I'm putting it in the warrant. I'd be happy to\nargue that case.\nAt this time --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't argue it to me. It\ndoesn't make much sense.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Prosecutors believed that\nRichards couldn't be avoided by putting the drugs and\nguns go together into the warrant instead of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- the judge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nabout the practice in Michigan? Since People against\nStevens and People against Vasquez have been decided,\nare there any cases, other than this one, in which a\nprosecutor has raised the knock and announce argument\nthat got litigated all the way to the appellate court?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there have been a handful\nof cases where defense attorneys have filed a motion,\ndespite People v. Stevens, and then they -- they have\nlost because of Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So but there really is no\nincentive for the prosecutor to fight -- argue about\nthis anymore in Michigan, is there?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No. Not, in the criminal\ncase, the prosecutor is responsible -- be, as it was in\nthis case, although the judge refused to follow Stevens\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it concedes there's a\nviolation.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- there should be no hearing.\nThey're not conceding the violation. They're simply\nsaying the -- a violation is irrelevant to the question\nof the admission of the evidence, so we should not\nlitigate it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there's no point in\nlitigating it.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's a functional\nequivalent of conceding a violation in every case\nbecause there's simply no effective remedy.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No effective remedy in the\nlitigation itself.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: In the criminal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, there's always\nthe possibility that the officer will be disciplined by\nhis very zealous superior, I guess.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Or -- or civil litigation.\nThere is no -- there is no exclusion. Yes, that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you dispute --\nyour -- your brother on the other side said in his\nargument that he had not heard a dispute about this.\nBut do you dispute his claim that there has never been\nany -- at least in recent history, any -- any civil\njudgment actually rendered against anyone in the\nofficer's position?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I -- I am not aware of one\nfrom Michigan. I am aware that there have been civil\njudgments against officers from other jurisdictions.\nI'm not aware of one in Michigan. I know there have --\nthere are some suits that have been brought in the\nEastern District that are pending. And -- and part of\nthe difficulty is civil suits can be brought. They can\nbe settled. There can even be trials and damages\nawarded, and they won't be in the reports. They're not\nin the F.Supp.'s. They're not in the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we don't -- we don't\nhave any indication that there's an effective\ndeterrence then in civil suits. Maybe there will be\nsome day, but we haven't seen it yet in Michigan, I\ntake it.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think one could also make\nthe argument that that cuts the other way. The fact\nthat there are not a lot of reported decisions may mean\nthere's not a lot of violations going on, that the\npolice are not routinely kicking down doors without\nknocking and announcing when they should, and that's\nwhy they're not being sued.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it may mean that -- that\npotential plaintiffs say if the courts are winking at\nthis in the criminal case, we don't have much chance of\ngetting a -- a verdict in a civil case.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No. It's not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know, but that\nmight be the case too, mightn't it?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It might be, but it's not been\nmy experience that either -- either the criminals or\ncertainly innocent parties, people -- probable cause,\nafter all, doesn't mean certainty. People who have had\ndamage done or physical injury occur have been -- are\nshy about suing the government in those circumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any evidence that\nthe citizens -- that Michiganders are less litigious\nthan people in other States?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That certainly hasn't been my\nexperience and certainly not in my county.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the mere existence\nof suits in other States ought to suffice as something\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's -- that's a\ndeterrent. Shouldn't it?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I would -- I would think so.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't understand\nwhere -- where we are with guns. You -- you have a\nspecific finding in a warrant that says there's\nprobable cause there's going to be a gun, and there's\ndrugs. I take it your position is that this allows you\nto enter without knocking.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It would be my position. I\nwould have thought, as the prosecutor thought here,\nthat a probable cause finding that guns are in the\nhouse, based not on any specific knowledge about guns,\nbut based on experience in similar circumstances, was\nnot sufficient to satisfy Richards in terms of not\nknocking. I would certainly make the argument that it\nought to be, but I would have not criticized the\nprosecutor, who didn't make that argument.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why would you bother\nmaking the argument? The evidence can't be suppressed.\nI don't understand why -- why would there ever be any\nlitigation over this issue in a criminal case?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: And -- and I think Your Honor\nis correct. The prosecutor's point in this case was we\nshouldn't litigate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And can you cite me any\nother example of a -- a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment? Maybe we shouldn't have held it's a\nviolation. I understand that argument. Is there any\nother area of Fourth Amendment law in which the\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment is not followed by a\nsuppression ruling?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, certainly. Let me give\nan example. One of the circumstances that I indicated\nthat the police -- a manner in which the police must\nbehave when reasonably executing a warrant is not to\nlook in places where the items sought cannot be found.\nIf the police were searching a house for stolen\ncomputer monitors, a large object, and as they were\nsearching for them, they opened the desk drawer where\nthe monitor could not be and they shut it, and they\nfound computer monitors in the home, the -- this Court\nhas never addressed the question, that I'm aware of,\nbut the law is uniform in the country that you would\nnot suppress the computer monitors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, now you're talking\nabout other cases in other courts. I looked through\nwith my law clerks 300 cases since Weeks, not Mapp,\nWeeks. That's what we're talking about, 1914. I\ncouldn't find in 300 cases one single Supreme Court\ncase that did not suppress evidence where there was a\nFourth Amendment violation with one exception. The\nexception is there are sets of cases where deterrence\nis really not a factor. For example, good faith; for\nexample, it isn't going into a criminal proceeding.\nOkay?\nNow, what I'd like you to do is to tell me if\nI missed some, which is certainly possible, or second,\nif you want us to change the rule and go back 300 years\nor 300 cases back before 1914, or are you going to tell\nus that deterrence doesn't play a role here or whatever\nyou want? I want to put to you the state of the art as\nfar as I can see it.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It would be my position that\nin all of those cases, there was a causal connection\nbetween the evidence found in the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a causal\nconnection absolutely here. It is a but-for\nconnection.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This person being in the\nroom and a child of 2 would know that if you get into a\nroom, as a result of your being in that room, you're\nlikely to find evidence. So it's both but for and it\nfits within the problem. There we are.\nThat's the same, by the way, as it is with\nmaking a false oath to a magistrate. You make a false\noath to a magistrate. That permits the magistrate to\nget into the house with -- the policeman gets in there\nwith a warrant. It doesn't take the court long to\nsuppress that. About a second. And -- and how -- how\nis this somehow different?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Let me try to give a couple of\nexamples from different situations to make my point\nthat there is a difference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, give some cases first.\nHe's talking about actual cases.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, isn't it possible\nthat if his law clerk overlooked Segura, he overlooked\nother cases as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. We read Segura. We\nread Segura, which happens to be a case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was unquestionably,\nwas there not, a violation of the Fourth Amendment in\nSegura?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Your Honor is correct, and I\nam confident that when the officers returned with the\nsearch warrant, with the officers already inside, they\ndid not knock and announce when they when they returned\nwith the search warrant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He is not -- well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that an example\nwhere there's a violation of the Fourth Amendment that\nis brought up and yet suppression is not the --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Because of the habeas concerns\nof comity that this Court has, that's correct. It is\nalso not suppressed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- important exception. The\nexception which comes from Silverthorne is when there\nis an independent chain of events such that it will be\n-- not could be, but would be -- in fact, discovered\nanyway, despite the unlawfulness -- Silverthorne --\nHolmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then\nbecause that's not going to impact deterrence. Now,\nthat's Segura. That's Silverthorne. That's case after\ncase. Of course, I accept that. And if you can show\nthat this case somehow fits within that chain, fine.\nThen I -- then I maybe appear I have my mind made up on\nthis, but I'm open to change.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let -- let me try a\ncouple of examples that --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- that I -- that I hope might\nmake the point. It is -- and my -- my belief is --\nit's common in human experience that things can be\naccomplished either by command or by permission when\nthe manner of doing so, the manner in which they end up\nbeing accomplished is subject to criticism. And let me\ngive a couple quick examples.\nIf, when she was young, I sent my daughter to\nher room -- and that was rare, but if I sent her to her\nroom and she stomped up the stairs and slammed the\ndoor, she would be in further difficulty not because\nshe carried out my command by going to her room, but\nbecause she stomped up the stairs.\nIf a young athlete is told by his coach,\ncatch the ball with two hands and he catches it with\none, he is admonished not because he caught the ball\nbut because he caught it with one hand.\nAnd if a football player taunts the opposing\nteam as he crosses the goal line, he gets a penalty not\nbecause he crossed the goal line, but because he\ntaunted the other team.\nThese strictures are not prerequisites to the\nconduct. I do not tell my daughter go to your room but\nonly if you don't stomp up the stairs --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's -- I -- I\nunderstand that point from your brief and I'm glad that\nyou brought it up. But I have never -- I have never\nseen Fourth Amendment matters cut that finely. I have\nnever seen the courts say I want to go back to the\nreason why this policeman is unlawfully in the room and\nthen try to connect each piece of evidence with that\nreason. Rather, they ask is he unreasonably and\nunconstitutionally in the room.\nSo my concern about that, which I'd like you\nto address, is if we took that approach, I think we'd\nbe doing it for the first time, and we'd let a kind of\ncomputer virus loose in the Fourth Amendment. I don't\nknow what the implications of that are. I can't tell\nyou what you're saying is illogical. It's not\nillogical. It's conceivable, but it strikes me as\nrisky and unprecedented.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think as -- as -- in the\nexamples I gave, knock and announce works the same way.\nThese are not prerequisites. They're rules of\nconduct. They are principles of behavior. It's not do\nthis only if you behave in this manner. It's do this\nand behave in this manner while doing it. And if you\ndon't behave in the manner we have prescribed, the\nquestion is what flows from that misbehavior, not from\nthe achievement of the end.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that your\nexample it's -- stomping up the stairs is like failing\nto knock and announce.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct, and -- and the\npolice are not illegally on the premises and my\ndaughter --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so there should be a\ndeterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've\ngot no deterrent for the knock and announce.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, and part of what -- part\nof what I wanted to say also to Justice Breyer and I\nthink also works here is it's -- the suggestion seems\nto be that knock -- that a Fourth Amendment violation\n-- the question of whether one has occurred and the\nquestion of whether or not the -- to apply the\nexclusionary rule are one in the same. And this Court\nhas never said that. To me that would be a dramatic\nchanging of the law of this Court. This Court has\nalways said those are separate questions, and I think\nPetitioner's argument conflates the two.\nWe first ask whether there has been a\nconstitutional violation and then we say -- this Court\nhas said the premise for application of the\nexclusionary sanction is whether or not the challenged\nevidence is the product of the illegal government\nactivity. So once we establish that there has been a\nconstitutional error, the question becomes is the\nchallenged evidence the product of it. And just like\nthe touchdown is not the product of the taunting, the\nentry into the premises is not the product of the\nfailure to knock and announce. It's the product of a\nwarrant, which the judge issued commanding the police\nto enter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem\nthat in -- in fact, it's the product of both? The\nwarrant alone does not get the police officer into --\ninto the building. It -- it is in fact the entry that\ngets the police officer into the building, the\nexecution of the warrant. The judge has to do\nsomething. The police officer has to do something.\nAnd the question that I think we face when we\nsay is the later search the product of the entry, is --\nis what your -- what -- I think a point that -- that\ncounsel on the other side was making. It's a pragmatic\npoint. Where do we draw the line of causation? And\nhis answer is -- and I think the -- the answer of the\ncases that Justice Breyer was -- was referring to -- is\nthis. We draw it in a way that will allow us to deter\nillegal police conduct, and if we engage in this\nslicing process of causation that you talk about, there\nwill be no deterrent for the violation of the no-knock\nrule. If instead we say, yes, this is enough the\nproduct that we ought to deter -- that we ought to --\nto respond to it in a way that will deter the no-knock\nand therefore we find causation and we get deterrence.\nWhat is fallacious about that argument?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: There's nothing fallacious\nabout the argument if one accepts that excluding the\ntruth in -- in a criminal proceeding is a fair tradeoff\nin that circumstance --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We do that every single time\nwe exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression\ncase, don't we?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: But -- but the Court has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't -- don't we?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, we do. But the Court has\nsaid that because that's a dramatic thing to do,\nbecause it -- it has a high societal cost, it should\nonly be done when there is a causal connection, when\nthe evidence is the product of the police wrongdoing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nBaughman.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nSuppression would not be an appropriate\nremedy in this context for two primary reasons. The\nfirst is if the knock and announce rule does not\nprotect the individual's privacy interest in the\nunderlying items seized and, instead, it seeks to limit\ndiscrete risks related to the execution of warrants\nthat property will be damaged, that officers will be\nmistaken for intruders, or that occupants will be\ncaught in embarrassing situations. That makes the\nknock and announce rule similar to other Fourth\nAmendment requirements related to the manner of\nexecuting warrants such as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what do you\nsay to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't\npreviously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to\ntrace the causal connection between a particular piece\nof evidence and a particular reason for the rule that\nwas broken? What we have said in the past is if the\nrule or the standard is violated and the search is\ntherefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in.\nYou're proposing a -- a different causal\nanalysis. You're proposing a causal analysis that\nrequires the connection between a piece of evidence and\nthe particular reason for one of these standards in\nevery case in which suppression is -- is requested.\nNumber one, do you agree that that -- that\nwould be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested? And\nnumber two, what would be the justification for that?\nMR. SALMONS: It would not be a departure,\nYour Honor. In fact, that's common practice in the\nFourth Amendment area. This Court, for example, in New\nYork v. Harris looked to the purposes of the rule\nagainst arrest in the home absent a warrant and to\nconclude that it wasn't appropriate to suppress a\nstatement made at the station even though it assumed\nthat there was but-for causation. And this Court in\nCruz did a similar analysis. It's very common to look\nto the purposes served --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's common, when you have a\nchain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere.\nIt's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the\nhome and now they're over in the station.\nMR. SALMONS: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This isn't over in the\nstation. This is in the home. You speak of interests,\nbut this doesn't interests.\nWhat about Boyd? I mean, the most famous\nstatement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions\non the part of the government and its employees of the\nsanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It\nis not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of\nhis drawers that constitutes the essence of the\noffense. But it is the invasion of his indivisible\nright of personal security, personal liberty, and\nprivate property.\nNow, I thought -- 1886 -- that's what's\ngoverned these cases for about 100 -- and far more, a\ncentury and a half or a quarter. And -- and the --\nthen suddenly you say, well, it's this interest in the\none or the other one. I mean, doesn't that describe\nit?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I mean,\ncertainly that's -- that is one of the principles\nunderlying the Fourth Amendment, but this Court has\nlooked to the types of considerations I'm discussing,\nand I will give you some examples. And we think, in\nfact, the knock and announce rule is very analogous to\n-- for example, to a claim of unnecessary property\ndamage or to a claim that the officers brought the\nmedia along when they shouldn't or that they used\nexcessive force.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no doubt in\nhere that an invasion of the home was authorized by the\nwarrant. Right?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The interest we're\ntalking about is not the sanctity of the drawers. It\nis 10 seconds that the officers should have waited\nadditionally, according to the -- to your brother.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. The illegality\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct? I'm sorry. That\nis correct? I -- I thought that this warrant does not\nsay you can enter the house without knocking.\nI mean, I have a warrant. This warrant lets\nme search the house in daytime. I search it in\nnighttime. Is my search authorized?\nMR. SALMONS: I don't think that would be a\nwarrantless search or I don't think that would be a\nviolation. That might be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have a warrant --\nMR. SALMONS: -- of the manner of execution.\nBut again, if I may --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what happens with my\nexample? I'm curious. That's not a rhetorical\nquestion.\nI have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th\nStreet. I search 1518 5th Street. Was it a warrant --\na warrant back search?\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't have a warrant to\nsearch 1518. I don't have a warrant that allows me to\ncome in in the middle of the night when it says day,\nand I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come\nin without knocking. So where's the warrant?\nMR. SALMONS: I think the question in that\ncase, Your Honor, would be about reasonable reliance on\nthe warrant and whether it was a reasonable mistake.\nAnd if it wasn't, then it would be a warrantless\nsearch.\nAnd if I may just focus the Court --\nattention on the claim of unnecessary property damage.\nWe think that's quite analogous here in part because\nthe typical -- in the typical case, a premature or\nunannounced entry will be a forcible entry. But\nwhether the claim is that the officers entered a few\nmoments prematurely or that they unnecessarily used a\nbattering ram on the door, in either case the -- the\nviolation doesn't relate to the privacy interests and\nthe items to be seized and shouldn't result in\nsuppression. And in addition to that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it does relate to the\nprivacy interests, and we've seen the explanation. One\nof the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is\nenough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy\nto say the police should not barge in like an invading\narmy.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, that certainly is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is a respect for\nprivacy.\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that certainly is true,\nYour Honor, but that -- that is not a protection --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that is involved -- and\nthat is -- that is the whole point of -- of knock and\nannounce, isn't it?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The point of\nknock and announce is a more limited privacy. It's not\nrelated to the privacy of the items to be seized.\nThat's separate. And that's why it makes it like the\nclaim of unnecessary --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We're talking about the\nprivacy of individual in his home, and the\nreasonableness of the search depends upon the\nreasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in\nhis home. Is that not the general rule?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I think what\n-- what focuses in terms of suppression is whether the\ngovernment has obtained an evidentiary advantage as a\nconsequence of the illegality. Here, the illegality\nwas the failure to delay a few additional moments\nbefore entry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then there will never be a\nsuppression of -- of evidence specified in a warrant\nwhen the warrant's no-knock component is violated --\nMR. SALMONS: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we -- we will say\n-- in every single time, following your argument, you\nwill -- we will say the -- the violation had nothing to\ndo with the authorization to seize the evidence. The\nviolation simply had to do with the -- with the -- the\nniceties and the risks involved in entering. So if we\naccept your argument, no-knock is -- is a dead duck,\nisn't it?\nMR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nIf I may try to explain. I think as a general matter,\nwith regard to physical evidence in the home that's\nwithin the scope of the search warrant, that you're --\nyou're probably right. Most of the time, that evidence\nwill come in.\nWe think that there are probably at least two\nareas that might lead to suppression in these cases.\nOne is the -- the type of statements that the Chief\nJustice mentioned earlier. Another might be what you\nmight call proximity evidence, that the officers went\nin prematurely and as a result, they saw a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, may I ask you\nthis -- this question? If you'd been the prosecutor in\nthis case and you had -- knew that the evidence would\nbe suppressed if there were a constitutional violation,\nwould you have conceded that there was a constitutional\nviolation in this case?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I don't think -- I think\nthere is a reasonable argument that could be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes or no.\nMR. SALMONS: I'm -- I'm attempting to answer\nthat, Your Honor. I think there's a reasonable\nargument that could be made in this case that there\nwasn't a violation. I think it was probably a smart\nstrategy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you would not have\nconceded.\nMR. SALMONS: I can't -- I can't second-guess\nthe strategy here to concede it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you would not have\nconceded. If you -- if you thought there was a\nreasonable argument, you would not have conceded that\nthere was a violation, would you?\nMR. SALMONS: I think I probably would have\nargued in the alternative, Your Honor. I think that's\nprobably the safest --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --\nwhat happens if there's a violation of the daytime\nwarrant provision in -- in a search warrant and the\nsearch is at night? Do we suppress?\nMR. SALMONS: I think generally no, Your\nHonor. I think -- and I would -- I would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases -- are\nthere cases on that?\nMR. SALMONS: I -- not in this Court. There\n-- there may be in the court of appeals. I think the\nway that the Court would analyze that would be, again,\nalong the same lines.\nNow, certainly in jurisdictions that haven't\nadopted the rule that we're articulating here, the\ncourts may suppress. But we think under the principles\nwe're articulating, that suppression probably would not\nbe appropriate there.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but apparently you're\nsaying we would not suppress because as long as the\nwarrant specified the items to be seized and they\ndidn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection\nbetween the fact that they broke in and disturbed\npeople in the night, when they were not authorized to,\nand their ultimate obtaining of -- of the evidence.\nOnce again, it seems to me if we follow your -- your\nreasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime\nand the daytime warrant is a dead letter.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, you know, we respectfully\ndisagree with that. We think that there are two\nseparate questions, what the Constitution requires and\nwhether suppression is an appropriate remedy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires --\nMR. SALMONS: The Court has always treated\nthose --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires a\nreasonable search. It is hornbook law that violating\nno-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a\ndaytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable\nsearch. You're saying that's utterly irrelevant\nbecause there's no causal connection between that\nviolation and the seizure of the particular items that\nthe warrant -- the warrant specified.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I may. It's\nalso hornbook law now in this Court that you can't\nunnecessarily destroy property in executing the warrant\nor effecting the entry and that you can't bring the\nmedia along. This Court in both Ramirez and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd to get your -- I'd like\nto get your position. I -- I think Justice Souter is\ncorrect, that under the theory you're arguing to us\nhere, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not\ngrounds for suppressing evidence. So we can have\nnighttime searches with no suppression remedy.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I think that's\nprobably the position that we would take. I think the\nway the Court would analyze that, as it has done in\nthese other cases, it would look to two factors. One,\nwhat are the purposes served by the Fourth Amendment\nrule that's violated and how well those purposes fit\nwith the remedy of suppression; and two, whether the\ngovernment obtained any evidentiary advantage as a\nresult of the violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSalmons.\nMr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Thank you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there --\nyou think there was a violation of the knock and\nannounce rule in this case. Correct?\nMR. MORAN: I do, Your Honor. The warrant\nwas never actually made part of the record, but my\nunderstanding, from the record we have, was that only\ndrugs -- there was only knowledge of drugs. The -- the\nwarrant authorized a search for guns because Officer\nGood told the magistrate that in his experience guns\nwere often associated with drugs. But they had no\nparticularized information about any guns on the\npremises. They only had particularized information\nabout drugs on the premises.\nThe issue here about causation goes back, I\nthink, to the common law. And as Justice Breyer\narticulated, when an officer is illegally in the home,\nthat causes his seizure of goods or his arrest of\npeople in the home to be illegal. If I can go all the\nway back to 1831, Chief Justice Shaw of the\nMassachusetts Supreme Court said, the rule is well\nestablished -- this is 1831 it was well established --\nthat where an authority given by law is exceeded, the\nparty loses the benefit of his justification and the\nlaw holds him a trespasser ab initio although, to a\ncertain extent, he followed the authority given. The\nlaw will operate to defeat all acts thus done under\ncolor of lawful authority when exceeded and a fortiori\nwill it operate to prospectively to prevent the\nacquisition of any lawful right by the excess and abuse\nof an authority given for useful and beneficial\npurposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you draw a\ndistinction between two cases? If they illegally\nentered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it\nwas supposed to be 15. They say, never mind. They go\nback out. There's another knock. They wait 15 and\nthey come in. Then it's all right. Correct?\nMR. MORAN: It might be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But you're\nsaying it's a world of difference if, when they go in\nand enter and they say, we should have waited 10 more\nseconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a\nsearch warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a\nsudden, it's invalid from there on. Those are the --\nthey're two different cases in your mind?\nMR. MORAN: I think that's -- that's right\nbecause an -- a reasonable search and seizure, as this\nCourt held in Wilson, requires a lawful entry. Eight\nJustices agreed that an -- a lawful entry is the\nindispensable predicate of a reasonable search in Ker\nv. California. These are not disconnected. It is not\nin.\nThe -- the prosecution's claim here, the\nRespondent's claim, would eliminate all manner of entry\narguments from the exclusionary rule. Nighttime\nsearch, use of excessive force, blowing up the building\nto get in, knocking a wall off the building wouldn't\nmatter. They were in -- they're in, they have a\nwarrant, everything is fine once they're in. It simply\nwouldn't matter for exclusionary purposes.\nIn Harris, I want to stress again in Harris\nthat this Court never questioned the fact that the\nevidence found inside the home had to be suppressed,\nand that's all we're asking for here. The evidence in\nthe home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
