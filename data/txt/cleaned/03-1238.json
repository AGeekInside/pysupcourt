PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThere are two issues in this case. One concerns\nwalking time, and the other concerns waiting time. And\nunless the Court has a different order, I'd propose to\nstart with the walking time.\nSection 4(a)(1)'s language, which comes from the\nPortal-to-Portal Act, which was enacted in 1947, by its\nplain terms clearly covers the walking that's involved in\nthese two cases. The statute, which is reproduced at the\nappendix of the petition, at 88(a), says that there is no\nmandatory compensation for, quote, \"walking to and from\nthe actual place of performance of the principal activity\nor activities which such employee is employed to perform.\"\nIt's difficult for me to imagine language that\ncould more directly cover what we're dealing with in this\nparticular case, because the Plaintiffs here are -- for\nIBP -- are employed to slaughter and to process beef. The\nemployees at Barber Foods are employed to process chicken.\nAnd thus, the actual place where they perform those\nservices are obviously on the lines where the processing\ntakes place.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that, but\nwe've held otherwise.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that we've --\nI don't know of any case where this Court has held\notherwise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've held that they're\n-- that the principal activity consists of doffing --\ndonning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, this Court said that\ndonning and doffing was a principal activity in\ncontradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary\nactivity for purposes of section 4(a)(2), but the Court\nspecifically said, in Steiner, that that holding does not\napply to matters that are specifically excluded under\nsection 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you think Steiner is\nirrelevant?\nMR. PHILLIPS: For -- no, I don't think it's\nirrelevant to the workplace. I think it is irrelevant to\nthe proper disposition of this case, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is if we don't accept\nthe continuous workday rule. If we do accept the\ncontinuous workday rule, why isn't it, in effect, the\npremise from which the conclusion for the other side\nfalls?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we don't have any quarrel\nwith the continuous workday rule. The question is, When\ndoes the workday begin? And our assessment of the\nworkday, as defined in section 4(a)(1), which controls,\nspecifically, the walking time in this particular case,\nbegins when you arrive at the actual place where you're\ngoing to perform the services --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your argument --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- or primary activities.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- assumes that there is only\none actual place. And their argument, which is consistent\nwith the text of the statute, is that there may be more\nthan one principal activity, and hence, more than one\nplace. And if the -- if the place of donning and doffing\nis such a place, then wouldn't it be at least\nadministratively odd to apply the continuous workday rule\nimmediately to exclude some walking time that follows\nthat?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so. I think it\nis perfectly sensible and a clear bright-line rule,\nJustice Souter, to say that when you arrive at the actual\nplace where you perform, not just any activities, and not\njust the activities that are integral and indispensable to\nyour working activities, but to the principal activities\nfor which you're hired -- and, admittedly, there can be\nmore than one of those, but that doesn't -- you know,\ndonning and doffing is not a principal activity --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, you're saying that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- of anyone who's cutting beef.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- so-called \"integral\nactivities\" are not principal activities.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. They don't have to\nprincipal activities. They're better understood as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They felt otherwise.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Phillips, I -- the\nSteiner opinion explicitly agreed with the lower court in\nthat case, which said that the term \"principal activity or\nactivities\" embraces all activities that are integral and\nindispensable.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if -- if you think that\nputting on the clothes fall within that, then that covers\nwalking, too --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- after that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The problem with that analysis is\nthat the court was only analyzing section 4(a)(2) for\nthese purposes. And what it was saying is, \"We are\nprepared to accept that there are certain activities that\nare either preliminary or postliminary, and then there are\nothers that are primary activities. And if you are\nintegral and indispensable to a primary activity, it is a\ncompensable event.\"\nRecognizing that Steiner is probably the most\nextraordinarily extreme facts that you could imagine,\nbecause we're talking about clothings that had -- clothing\nthat had to be changed in order to protect the public --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Phillips --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- health and safety.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you're asking us to\ninterpret the same words, \"principal activity or\nactivities,\" differently in sub (2) that was at issue in\nSteiner, and in sub (1), and then the clause that follows\nboth of those. The same phrase is used. So if \"principal\nactivity\" includes donning or doffing, under sub (2), why\nwouldn't the same follow for sub (1) and the following\nclauses?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because you have to read the\nlanguage \"principal activity or activities\" in (a)(1)\nwithin the context of what Congress was trying to achieve\nby the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was to absolutely and\ncategorically exclude walking time from being part of\nmandatorily compensated activities of a particular\nemployee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is included if it's --\nonce the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk\nfrom one station to the other. That walking time, I think\nit's conceded, would be included.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, if your date -- if the\nprincipal activity is donning and doffing, then the\nwalking time thereafter would also be included.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Ginsburg, if you\nstep back and think about this language in the context of\nthe words that are written here, it says, \"walking to and\nfrom the actual place of performance of the principal\nactivity.\" No one would think that that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Or activities.\"\nMR. PHILLIPS: Or activities. But, again,\nJustice Souter, all that suggests is that there are times\nwhen somebody who's working in a clothing operation may --\nyou know, may spend time distributing the cloth or may\nspend time actually sewing the cloth. Those are two\nseparate activities. They're different activities. But\nit doesn't mean -- and it certainly doesn't convert\nanything that had -- can be described as \"integral and\nindispensable\" into a primary activity which such employee\nis employed to perform. No employee, in these cases, was\nemployed to perform the act of putting on clothes or the\nact of picking up equipment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about the\npossibility, \"it depends on the clothes and depends on the\nequipment,\" so that, in Steiner and here, it's a lot of\nprotective gear, it's really quite part of the job and\nspecial and unusual. In Mt. Clemens, it's a kind of\nuniform. It's just washing your hands up, putting on an\napron. So, where it's minor putting on clothes, as\nsomeone might in his house, doesn't come in substantial,\ndoesn't come in integral and indispensable; but where it's\nquite a big deal, it does. And who decides? The agency.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two parts about\nthat that are worth focusing on. One is, I don't think\nyou can lump the two cases together, because the clothing\nor the equipment that has to be put on with respect to the\nBarber Foods company is barely -- is quite minimal and,\nindeed, was deemed to be diminimus. So, I'm not -- I'm not\nsure you can lump the two cases together in that way.\nBut also, in terms of where the Secretary comes\nout on this, let's not forget 79.7(g), footnote 49, which\nis, candidly, the clearest statement from the Secretary\nwith respect to, What do you do when you have donning and\ndoffing that is followed by walking time? And what does\nthe -- and what does the regulation specifically say? And\nthat's on, I think, 92 and 93 of the appendix to our\npetition. It specifically says that that walking time is\nnot excluded, not necessarily --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily excluded. It's\nreally noncommittal on the point.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, except that, under their\ntheory of this case, it is always excluded. Always. So\nthat whatever else you can say about the meaning of that\nparticular language, the interpretation the Secretary\noffers to you today flatly rejects --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But \"in certain\" --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that language.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that footnote -- that's\nwhere I actually got the idea -- it says, \"We reserve, in\ncertain situations.\" To me, that meant sometimes it can\nbe a major big deal to don clothing -- protective gear;\nsometimes it isn't -- an apron. And whose job is it? Now\nI'm repeating myself.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Secretary's.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but -- and if we were talking\nabout that in the context of other kinds of activities --\nif you're back in the (a)(2) world of looking at whether\nsomething's preliminary or postliminary, I have less of a\nproblem with dealing with that. The problem is, here\nwe're talking about (a)(1) activities, the core of what\nCongress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act to protect\nemployers for.\nThe Portal-to-Portal Act is not a statute that\nremotely provides protections for the employees. This is\na statute that was designed to protect employers from\nbillions of dollars of liability. And so, when you're\ntalking about, \"Under what circumstances can you ignore\nthe flat prohibition on requiring walking time to be\nregarded as a mandatory subject of compensation?\" then it\nseems to me the distinction you're proposing doesn't work.\nAnd it's also, Justice Breyer, again, flatly\ninconsistent. Their -- that's not their theory of the\ncase. Their theory of the case is, \"If we can describe it\nas in any way integral and indispensable to some other\nactivity, that makes it a primary activity, that starts\nthe workday, and everything after that then becomes\ncompensable.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, can I call your\nattention to the text of Section 254(a)? It's in the red\nbrief in the Alvarez case, at App. 1. What it -- what it\nsays is that you don't have to pay overtime compensation\nor minimum wages for and on account of any of the following\nactivities: (1) \"walking, riding,\" blah, blah, blah. This\nis (1).\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for the \"place of\nperformance of the principal activity or activities which\nsuch employee is employed to perform.\"\nMR. PHILLIPS: Now you skipped over \"actual\nplace,\" there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Scalia, but -- which I\nthink is an important --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- word.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (2) \"activities which are\npreliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity\nor activities.\"\nYou're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the\ntext itself joins them. The activities referred to in (2)\nare \"said principal activity or activities.\" The \"said\"\nrefers to the ones that are in (1).\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can we possibly sever (1)\nand (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one\nthing; for purposes of two, it means something else?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because when the court was\ninterpreting (a)(2) in Steiner, it wasn't interpreting\n(a)(2) to determine whether something was a postliminary\nactivity in connection with \"said preliminary\n-- primary activities.\" What it was saying is, these are\nnot preliminary and postliminary activities, that they are\nexcluded from that. And so, the court's really coming up\nwith what is a third category of cases, which deals with\nintegral and indispensable activities to a primary\nactivity. They didn't have to analyze it as a primary\nactivity. All they had to say was, it's not -- that the\npreliminary and postliminary activities are not simply\ntemporal, that there is a substantive component to it.\nAnd that is essentially the holding of the court\nin Steiner. It says there's a substantive component; and,\ntherefore, we're not going to just simply look in -- time-\nwise, whether it comes before or after principal\nactivities. We're going to decide that there are some --\nthere are some situations that are so important that they\nneed to be compensated under (a)(2), because they don't\nfall within preliminary or postliminary language.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Phillips, it says it\n-- either something is before, preliminary; or after,\npostliminary. And if it's neither of those, then, it\nseems to me, it fits -- it's not before the principal\nactivity, and it's not after the principal activity, so\nwhat else is it, other than the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's work --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- principal activity?\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that's mandatorily compensable\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act. Remember, the Fair\nLabor Standards Act, under this Court's interpretations\nfrom Mt. Clemens Pottery and the cases that preceded it, I\nmean, it -- you know, it had a very sweeping definition of\nwhat is work within the meaning -- within the meaning of\nwhat is compensable as minimum wages and as overtime. And\nthat's in place.\nAnd now Congress has stepped in and said, \"Well,\nwait a second. When we did it -- when that got\ninterpreted that broadly, we're talking about $6 billion\nin liability.\" So, it's very important, given that we're\ntalking about fairly minimal activities on the -- on the\n-- that are involved here, triggering potentially massive\nliabilities. And so, what we've done is, we've excluded\nfrom those massive liabilities the walking, riding, and\ntraveling time, because that's the basis on which you end\nup with big numbers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your approach\nintroduces, really, a third concept. You have the\nprincipal activities and you have -- either preliminary or\npostliminary -- and now you've got a third concept:\nintegral. But the statute -- that's nowhere in the\nstatute.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I mean, that -- but\nthat's -- this Court's decision in Steiner was the one\nthat reached out to decide that \"integral and\nindispensable\" was a category of activities that were\ngoing to be compensable, even though, on the face of them,\nthey may have appeared to be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless they were\nsaying those activities were, in fact, principal\nactivities. If it's integral, if it's embraced by the\nprincipal activity, it is a principal activity, and that\nat least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it\nin two categories rather than inventing a third.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think that creates\nany particular problem, but what you end up doing, Mr.\nChief Justice, under those circumstances, is, you\ncompletely eliminate the protection that Congress meant to\nprovide here for walking, riding, and traveling time,\nwhich is -- which is a vital consideration --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how does -- how\ndoes your analysis apply? Let's say these employees had\nto change their equipment several times during the course\nof the day.\nMR. PHILLIPS: You mean after they've --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I mean, the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- arrived at the actual place --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the equipment is only\ngood for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to\nget new ones. They have to walk back to the place --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they have to doff the\nother equipment, don new equipment, and walk back.\nWouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is\nexcluded?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. No. Once you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: We don't have any quarrel with\nthe argument that once you, for the first time, arrive at\nyour actual place of performing the principal activity for\nwhich you were hired, which is cutting beef or whatever it\nhappens to be in your hypothetical -- once you arrive\nthere, that does begin the workday. That's the definition\nof what starts the workday, which is why I -- to our mind,\nthis is a much clearer and brighter-line rule. We can\ntell you precisely when you start the workday. It's when\nyou get to the place where you got hired to work, and\nstart to do that work.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you have compensated\nactivities that do not begin the workday?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, you do have compensated --\nand that's true for lots of different situations, Justice\nKennedy. You could have a situation where you go home,\nand you get called back in on an emergency, and nobody\ndisputes that that's clearly compensable time, and nobody\nhas ever seriously argued that you ought to extend the\nworkday --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens with the\nmicrochip or a laboratory with highly contagious viruses\nwhere there's got to be two hours of scrubbing and then\nthere's a walk? What do you do with that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: If the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Two hours of scrubbing --\nMR. PHILLIPS: You know, it's -- it's very\npossible that the scrubbing will be regarded as an\nintegral and indispensable part of the -- of the -- of the\nemployment, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then there's -- but then\nthere's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- therefore, it's compensable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but then there's a walk.\nWhat about the walk?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The walk is not compensable,\nbecause Congress didn't want you to have walking until you\ngot to the actual place where you would perform the\nservices. And nobody's principal activity as an employee\nis to go take a shower or to go and pick up certain types\nof clothing. That's not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the problem --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the understanding of\n\"principal activity.\"\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Phillips, the problem I\ncontinue to have is that I thought Steiner embraced,\nexplicitly, the notion that principal activity embraces\nall activities that are integral and indispensable. You\ntake issue with that, but do you want us to overrule\nSteiner --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- or make some changes in\nit? I just don't understand.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I want you to limit Steiner to\nthe very unusual facts that arose in that particular\ncontext. I -- we don't have any quarrel with the\n\"indispensable and integral\" test as a reason for\nbeginning -- as a reason for compensating certain\nactivities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was --\nMR. PHILLIPS: What we do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- so unusual about the\nfacts --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was so unusual\nabout the facts in Steiner? They're pretty common.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I -- the notion that if\nyou didn't shower and change, you would expose not only\nyourself, but your family and everybody else to the risks\nof lead poisoning is a pretty extraordinary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- circumstance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the routine where you\nhave to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to\nshower when you're done, whether it's being -- the\nmeatpacking or the stuff at Steiner -- that's a pretty\ncommon occurrence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, well, I would -- I would\nargue that you could make a -- you could make a claim that\nnone of that donning and doffing ought to be compensable.\nAnd, candidly, we've made that argument. But,\nunfortunately, the court didn't grant the petition on that\nparticular -- on that particular question. So, we have to\ntake it as a given. But I don't -- I don't -- I -- for\nexactly the reason you identify, Mr. Chief Justice, that\ndoes create a problem. I mean, part of this problem is a\nbit contrived. I don't think that the ordinary donning\nand doffing ought to trigger the beginning of the workday.\nBut, assuming that it does --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- I still don't think -- I'm\nsorry, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, I didn't mean --\nfinish.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I still don't think that,\neven if you accept that that is compensable conduct within\nthe meaning of Steiner, which I -- that's what it's\ntalking about -- but Steiner, Justice O'Connor, doesn't\nsay anything about the fact that there was going to have\nto be walking or traveling, or the workday. The court, in\nSteiner, clearly had in mind the workplace, where you're\nproducing batteries. There's a lot of language in that\nopinion that says, \"This is where you really do the work.\nThat's your battery, and here's where you're going to get\n-- engage in activities that we think you need to be\ncompensated.\" But the court never remotely suggested that\nyou were entitled to the walking time between those two.\nAnd, if you go back to 790.7(g), that language\nspecifically told every employer that simply because you\nhave to pay for certain kinds of activities at the outset,\nbecause they're integral and indispensable, as decided by\na court, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to pay for\nall the walking time. And so, you've got to come up with\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- a theory that supports that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so for all activities that\nare -- that are integral and indispensable? What about\nsharpening tools?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, sharpening tools is the\neasiest one, because you do that right on your workplace.\nI mean, that's exactly what Congress had in mind in its\nlegislative history --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- but suppose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but your time shouldn't\nstart from then.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not the\nhypothetical. Suppose you sharpen the tools outside, by\nyour locker, and then you -- then you go for a 10-minute\nwalk to get to the -- and you carry the sharpened tool?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, if the Court decided\nthat sharpening the tools, even though it's done not at\nthe same time, which is what Congress had in mind when it\n-- when it identified that hypothetical -- but, even if\nyou assume that, that that's integral and indispensable,\nit still isn't what triggers the time for starting the\nactual employment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't your -- in the\nanswer that you just gave, and an answer which you have,\nin fact, consistently repeated, inconsistent with Steiner\n-- Steiner didn't say there is a separate category of\nintegral activities. Steiner said that activities which\nare integral are part of the principal activity. And\nisn't your argument premised on denying that identity?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I can accept that identity\nfor purposes of distinguishing between what's preliminary\nand postliminary activity. What I cannot do is to -- is\nembrace that for purposes of deciding when walking\ntime/traveling time ought to be included. Congress was as\nplain as it could humanly be in saying that, \"We're not\ngoing to allow walking and traveling time to be included\nin an unexpected fashion.\" And that is precisely -- as\nthe Chamber of Commerce brief says, that is precisely what\nwe're talking about here.\nAnd, candidly, as Judge Boudin said in his\nconcurring opinion, the circumstances arising in this\ncontext bear a very eery resemblance to the situation that\ngave rise to the Portal-to-Portal Act in the first place.\nAnd so -- and I think it's important to put this into\ncontext. You know, the language of the statute, as I read\nit, clearly is in our favor. The purpose of the statute\nis clearly in our favor. And then the question is, Did\nthis Court, in a decision that dealt solely with 4(a)(2),\nmean to vastly change the scope of 4(a)(1) in a way that\nwould dramatically expose employers to liability --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why is it so dramatic, if\nwe recognize that nothing begins until the donning and\ndoffing -- that is, the travel to wherever you don and\ndoff?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: None of that is included,\neven from the plant gate to the place where you don and\ndoff.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the -- well, in part, because\nplants are not -- have never been designed -- remember,\nwe've got 79.6 -- the Secretary of Labor told employers\nfor 50 years, \"You can set up your plant without fearing\nthat you're going to suddenly be hit with walking time\nafter somebody engages in donning and doffing, even if it\nturns out to be integral and indispensable.\" For 50\nyears, they followed that advice. They set up all of\ntheir plants with that expectation. And now this Court,\nif it follows the ninth circuit's lead, will suddenly say,\n\"Okay, what you need to go out and find is all of the\nintegral and indispensable activities\" -- not just donning\nand doffing -- any integral and indispensable activity\nthat you can get a court to buy into, that will start this\never-expanding workday, such that any walking that goes on\nafter that and before you get done with all of these ever-\nexpanding post-doffing activities. Then you have the --\nthat's -- you know, so you have this broad -- and that's\nwhy you're going to have these -- substantially greater\nand totally unexpected liabilities on the workplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that advice contained,\nthat you say was given to --\nMR. PHILLIPS: 790.7(g), footnote 49, and it\nsays, as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- plain as day --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not necessarily.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -- there -- there, it\nmeans always. Always.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that they operated\non the assumption that it meant never.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I'm prepared to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me they were on\nnotice that, although it did not, necessarily, it might.\nI think you're --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It might, and -- but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you're exaggerating the\neffect of that statement.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Scalia--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's right, they don't\nsay -- I mean, they exclude, for example, the canine cases,\nwhere you have to walk and feed the dog in the morning before\nyou show up at work. So --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they're not saying\nonly --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the Secretary does. I don't\nknow whether the plaintiffs necessarily do. And certainly\nthe plaintiffs in those cases didn't. They took the\nposition that the workday started as soon as you engaged\nin protecting the canines, just as in -- insurance\nindustry, they -- the insurance adjusters are all taking\nthe position that as soon as they have to get on the\ncomputer, that's an integral and indispensable part of\ntheir day, and everything after that, including traveling\nand movement, are all part and parcel of what gets added\nin there.\nWhat I'm suggesting to you is that once you go\ndown this path and you say, \"Okay, we're going to define\nthe workday by reference to whatever somebody determines\nis integral and indispensable,\" you are going to have an\nexpandable workday, and that if you are really looking for\na fairly clear rule, you sit -- you stick with what the\nlanguage of the statute says, which is, the actual place\nof the performance of the activity for which you were\nhired. Once you've got that in place -- that's not to say\nthat's the full length of when you get compensated. You\ncan be compensated for activities outside of that workday.\nHappens every day, when you have to come in for an\nemergency or if you have to come in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem with your argument\nis Steiner.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I understand the problem with\nSteiner, Justice Kennedy, but I think it is inappropriate\nto read Steiner, which says, point-blank, \"Our holding\ndoes not deal with conduct that is specifically excluded\nby 4(a)(1),\" and then -- and ignore that. That whole --\nthat statement of the holding of the court seems to me to\nsay, \"All we're telling you the answer to\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- \"is 4(a)(2).\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only thing specifically\nincluded in (a)(1) is walking, riding, or traveling to and\nfrom the actual place of performance of the principal\nactivity or activities. And once you assume that\n\"principal activity or activities\" includes everything\nthat's integral and essential to principal activities,\n(a)(1) doesn't cover it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, you can get to the logic of\nthat. The question is, Is it appropriate to apply the\n\"integral and indispensable\" test, which is an atextual\nstandard, in a way that essentially guts 4(a)(1) and the\nfundamentally important values that it was designed to\nserve? And what I'm suggesting to you is, that's a\nmistake. And we know that, because the regs protected us\nagainst this precise event. It is exactly what the\nPortal-to-Portal Act was designed to accomplish, and it's\nthe better interpretation of this particular statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, may I just ask\nyou a preliminary question about the IBM case -- IP -- IBP\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: IBP.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- IBP case? As I understand\nit, whatever we do here is irrelevant to what the bottom\nline is going to be in that case, because the\ndetermination is going to be made only under State law.\nThe court below said that's what it was going to do. And\nthe employees are not objecting. So, it seems that that\ncase, as distinguished from Tum, is really not anything\nthat this Court should decide, because it would be\nacademic.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, they don't argue that it's\nmoot. And it's not purely academic. There are collateral\nconsequences to deciding what the Federal law issue is in\nthis particular context. We briefed this issue at the cert\nstage at some length, and the court granted cert, so I'm\nassuming that, in some respects, you, sort of, pass by\nthat particular problem.\nThere are collateral consequences. And the\nother side, again, doesn't say it's -- that it has mooted\nthis case; it simply says that there's this serious issue\non remand as to precisely how it'll all play out.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could you give us a collateral\nconsequence? I mean that is --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, because it -- reas judicata\ncollateral estoppel effects from the ruling that we've --\nthat we have violated federal law, both that might be\navailable to the Secretary of Labor and otherwise.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- balance of my minutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the previous questioning suggests, the\noutcome of this case follows directly from Steiner. The\nPortal Act, by its terms, applies only to activities that\noccur before the commencement of -- before the\ncommencement of, or after the conclusion of, the\nemployees' principal activities. Steiner holds that\ndonning and doffing, such as in this case, is \"part of\" --\nthat's a quote -- the employees' principal activities, and\nit, therefore, follows that the Portal Act applies only to\nactivities either prior to, or after, that donning and\ndoffing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why isn't walking from the\ngate of the -- of the factory to the -- to the place where\nyou're on the assembly line, why isn't that integral and\nessential to the performing of the activities?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because -- and this is the\nlanguage that Mr. Phillips is referring to in Steiner --\n4(a)(1) itself makes clear that a walk will not be the\nfirst principal activity, including on the theory that\nit's integral and indispensable. The first principal\nactivity has to be something other than a walk, and that's\nwhat happens in this case. As in Steiner, there is\ndonning at the beginning of the day. That's part of the\nprincipal activities --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, but if -- once you\naccept the theory that the principal activity includes\nthose things that are integral, you can say walking from\nthe gate of the plant to the assembly line is part of the\nprincipal activity. Now, walking to the gate may not be\npart of the -- may not be part of the principal activity,\nbut -- I --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Two reasons, Justice Scalia.\nThe first is the one that I gave, and that is, the Steiner\nCourt concluded that -- and that was the end of the\nsentence, where it said, \"except as excluded by 4(a)(1),\"\nthat Congress made clear in 4(a)(1) -- that the initial\nwalk wouldn't be the first principal activity. Second,\nthe walk won't be integral and indispensable. The test\nfor whether or not something is integral and indispensable\nis whether it's work that's required and closely related\nto the productive activities. And simply walking to the\ndonning station is not. That's in contradistinction to\nputting on the clothes that are required here, required as\na matter of law in order to do your job. That's the line\nthat the statute draws.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about the dog\ngrooming cases?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The dog cases, Justice Kennedy\n-- and I -- let me make sure we're -- I have your\nhypothetical, and that is, the police officer at home\ngrooms the dog --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- then comes into the office.\nThat is part of their principal activities. The\nsubsequent commute is not compensable, on the ground that\nit is a break and a commute. That's covered by the Fair\nLabor Standards Act. The Portal Act is concerned with\nsomething else -- that is, before the beginning and after\nthe end of your day. The dog cases are, of course, also\nentirely different from this one. You have -- you have\narrived at the place of the performance of your principal\nactivity. Steiner said that occurred, quote/unquote, \"on\nor off the production floor.\" And so, you're at the\nplant, and your workday has started.\nJustice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply\nwant to reinforce it, that the reference in -- to\n\"principal activities\" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the\nreference to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(1), but it's\nalso the reference to principal activities in the\nconcluding clause of section 4.\nIf I could just take the Court to that. The\nstatute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places,\nbut it's also at page 3 of our brief.\nAnd so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this\nconcluding clause, and the text frames the workday. And\nit says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply\nto activities which occur -- I'm quoting now -- \"which\noccur either prior to the time on any particular workday\nat which such employee commences, or subsequent to the\ntime on any particular workday at which he ceases, such\nprincipal activity or activities.\" And it simply follows,\nas a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that\nthose activities, \"such principal activities,\" include the\ndonning and the doffing, that everything that happens\nbetween those two events is not encompassed by the Portal\nAct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- answer to Justice\nKennedy said that the dog cases were distinguishable\nbecause there was a break in the principal activity. So,\nif we were to rule in your favor, all the employer has to\ndo is make sure that the donning and doffing station's far\nenough away from the production line so that there will be\na sufficient break between the two activities.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the -- both the donning\nand the doffing and the walking in between and the wait\nfor the equipment, which is the bulk of the time in all\nthese cases, would be compensable. The Department of\nLabor has regulations --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you mean \"it\nwould be\" -- that's my question.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Chief\nJustice. There -- the donning and doffing in the Alvarez\ncase, by and large, happens in one place: in a locker\nroom. In the Tum case, by contrast, the employees show up\nat a cage, they wait for things, they walk, they pick up\nsomething else, they wait, they pick up something else.\nAnd so, there's a body of time that I refer to as the\ndonning and doffing process. All of that would clearly be\ncompensable, even in your hypothetical. Your hypothetical\nwould address the final piece of time, and that is, you\nget your last piece of clothing on, and you have to go to\nthe floor, and the employer could say, \"Take a 15 minute\nbreak,\" in there. I suppose that's hypothetically\npossible. I think the reason it doesn't happen in these\ncases and in the other cases I've studied is that the\nemployer has an incentive, when they're forced to\ncompensate, to do things efficiently.\nWhat happens is, the employer will say, \"All\nright, your shift is going to start at 6:30 in the\nmorning; therefore, you can clock in and start donning at\n6:23.\" That's a 7-minute window, and that forces the\nemployees to do everything efficiently. They don't insert\nartificial breaks.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but why -- if you're\ntalking about efficiency, it may well be that the\nemployees, instead of imposing upon the employer the costs\nof moving the donning and doffing location closer to the\n-- to the place where the real work is being done, they\nmight prefer, instead, to get a slight salary increase per\nhour. But -- and that is -- that is possible, under the\npetitioner's scheme, because it is left to private\nnegotiation; whereas, what you say is that they must pay\nfor that. They must pay for that walk from the donning\nand doffing. They cannot negotiate out of it, because if\nit's in the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is mandatory.\nSo I -- don't talk to us about efficiency. It\nseems to me that the efficiency arguments are on the other\nside. Leave it to the private sector. The employers --\nthe employees can decide what they care more about.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, I -- all I\nhave in -- before me that I can rely on is the statute\nthat Congress enacted. Your point would cover, of course,\nequally, the donning and doffing in Steiner itself.\nCongress made some choices about things that were going to\nbe compensable. It's worth noting that Congress drew a\nline about whether -- in terms of whether there was a\ncollective bargaining agreement involved, because under\nsection 203(o) of the statute, in workplaces covered by a\ncollective bargaining agreement, you can negotiate out of\nat least clothes changing.\nBut I think within the framework of the statute\nthat we do have, I am actually quite correct, and that is,\nright now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt\nan efficient scheme for arranging donning and doffing.\nThey can put things in different buildings if they like.\nThe employees here are required to spend 10 or 20 minutes\nwaiting for different clothing at different times,\ndepending on how long the lines are. It is a workable\nscheme that Congress designed that said, \"We're going to\nhave a workday.\" And the employer is in charge of\ndeciding when the workday begins or ends, but, during that\nworkday, they're going to have to pay.\nI did want to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, I just wanted\nto have a clear answer to the question Justice Scalia\nasked you. Is it so that collective bargaining could not\ntrade off the compensation for the walking and the donning\nand doffing for some other benefit that the employees\nmight prefer?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, it is an\nunsettled question, is the answer. I will give you the\nbest answer I can. 203(o) allows for the negotiation away\nof clothes changing time. The question whether clothes-\nchanging time includes safety equipment is a matter in\ndispute. The ninth circuit held that it didn't. This\nCourt denied certiorari on that question.\nThe further question, if you did negotiate away\nthe clothes changing time, whether that would negotiate\naway the walking and waiting time has not been confronted\nby a court, so far as I am aware. It might be said to\nlogically follow, but it hasn't been decided. It's not\npresented by this case, because cert was denied. And so,\nI haven't thought very much --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you say it's an open\nquestion.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is. I'm confident it's an\nopen question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- about what gear qualifies?\nThat is, here we have no dispute that this is protective\ngear. But it's not any changing that counts. So, how do\nwe know whether this is the kind of donning and doffing\nthat's compensated in -- or the kind that isn't?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The line that has been drawn by\nthe Department of Labor, is where I will start, and the\nDepartment of Labor -- and let me give you some citations\n-- says that the line is between whether the employer\nrequires you to do the donning and doffing on the plant or\nnot. The citations for that are section 785.24(c) of the\nregulations, 790, note 65. And then it contrasts clothes-\nchanging that's by your own choice, in 790.7(g). I think\nthat's a sensible line, but it's not presented by this\ncase.\nJustice Breyer, it goes to your characterization\nof the final sentence of footnote 49, and that is:\nsometimes.\nThe reason I think it's sensible to draw the\nline that the Department has in required clothes changing\nis that the employer will only require you to do it onsite\nif it is truly integral and indispensable to your job;\notherwise, it'll be optional, or they'll let you do it at\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you about a -- the\nother part of the case? I mean, I think, as I've\nsuggested, most of these things are up to the agency.\nThey're minor things in law, so -- but it seems well\nestablished in the agency reg, as well as in Skidmore, the\nfamous line about waiting being, \"Are you waiting to be\nengaged, or are you engaged to wait?\" So, assuming that\nthis is just putting on and off clothes that are essential\n-- so, assume you win on that part -- when they wait to\nput on the clothes, you would think -- if it's like an\nairport, sometimes you wait; if you're lucky, you don't.\nWell, under those circumstances, you wouldn't be engaged\nto wait. You're waiting to put on the clothes, not -- you\nknow, etcetera -- so, why would you win on that part?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I, again, make sure I have\nthe hypothetical in terms -- we are, in a sense, talking\nabout the first wait. You show up at the first --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- what happens -- you win\non the --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- clothes. They're protected\ngear. That's the assumption. That's part of the job.\nThe workday begins. But you have to get there, and you\nwait to get the clothes. On that --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- one, why not Skidmore? Why\nnot the reg? And, if so, why don't you lose on that one?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You are -- in that situation,\nyou're waiting for the very first piece of equipment. In\nthe Tum case, you show up at the cage at the beginning of\nthe day. You are engaged to wait. The regulatory\ncitations are two: 790.6(b) and 790.7(h). There's also a\ncase that's confronted this, which is the Metzler case,\n127 F.3d 959. All those authorities make clear that if\nthe employer tells you, \"Show up to do something, show up\nhere to put on your clothes,\" and, because of the way the\nemployer has designed the system, you have to wait,\nthrough no fault of your own --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose sometimes you have\nto wait? Sometimes it's a minute, sometimes it's nothing.\nIs it like an airport? Or does the employer here say,\n\"You must show up seven minutes early, because there'll be\na wait\"?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's the -- it would be the same\nresult whether the employer puts a time on it or not. The\nemployer says -- I'll give you an example we could agree\non, when it's a time --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that what the reg says?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The reg doesn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's surprising I didn't see\nthat in the reg, if it says that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The regulation gives this\nexample, which I think is on point, and that is, if you\nare told to show up for when the production begins -- the\nmeat's going to come across -- and the machine breaks down\nor they simply don't start sending the meat until five\nminutes later, the fact is that you get compensated,\nbecause you're supposed to be there. The fact that they\ntell you, \"Be there for the\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where it's first in the day.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: First thing --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in the day.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Unquestionably.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you would say that\nthe whole principle of, you know, \"Are you engaged to\nwait, or waiting to be engaged?\" just contradicts the\nprinciple that was adopted in Steiner. I mean, are you\nputting -- are you employed to put on your -- to put on\nyour clothes, or are you putting on your clothes to do\nyour work? And Steiner essentially repudiates that. So,\nyou know, let's forget about Skidmore.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nJustice Breyer is testing a very particular piece of time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: He's trying to say, What is --\nlet me take you to the text of the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- he's trying to figure out\nwhen the -- the final clause of 4(a) talks about\ncommencement -- he want to know when it commences. Does\nit commence when you get in line or when you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- first get the piece of\nclothes? It's a fair question. The other side hasn't\nmade any argument that it doesn't include the first wait,\nI think, because you're told that you have to don, it's\npart of your principal activity.\nLet me also say, this, I think, is a somewhat\nacademic question when it comes to -- and nothing against\nacademics, but the -- it's a somewhat academic question\nwhen it comes to actual workplaces, because what happens\nis what I described before, the employers, under employers\nthat are following our rule, do set up a time clock, and\nthey say, \"Show up at 6:23, and that's when you can clock\nin.\" They have computerized swipe cards, and the computer\nwon't recognize them until 6:23. And it's the time after\nthat that will be compensable. So, if the Court were to\nsay the donning and doffing process starts and ends the\nworkday for purposes of the Portal Act, everyone will\nunderstand what the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't decided below,\nwas it? It was just a question of walking and waiting,\nand they weren't specific about whether that included\nwaiting or walking, predonning.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. The reason for\nthat is, there isn't a predonning wait in the Alvarez\ncase, where the plaintiffs won, and the Tum plaintiffs\nlost on an unrelated theory that the actual donning and\ndoffing couldn't start the workday.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, perhaps we shouldn't\nreach a question that hasn't been aired and decided below.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And my formulation, which is\nsimply the donning and doffing process, would, in fact,\nleave the -- to the lower courts the question of precisely\nwhen donning begins and doffing ends. That's a fair point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, since you\ndisplay such respect for the agency here --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what do you do about the\nagency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of\nthe case, and which says that the mere fact that donning\nand doffing may require compensation does not necessarily\nmean that travel between the clothes changing place and\nthe actual place of performance would be excluded?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, my answer, I\nthink, is that -- you had it right in the first half hour,\nand that is, that phrase --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- \"not necessarily,\" can mean\none of two things; i.e., we're denying that it follows a\nfortiori, or we're simply not deciding the question.\nThe agency itself, which -- the Secretary wrote\nthis guidance -- the agency explains that it meant that\nwe're simply not deciding it. That's actually perfectly\nintelligible and a correct understanding of the history.\nRemember, the Portal Act gets enacted, and, right\nafterwards, the Secretary issues this guidance that then\ngets put in the CFR. This was their first reaction to the\nAct. Subsequently, after several years, these are -- what\nyou're referring to is something in the -- what are known\nas the Part 790 guidance. Later on, the Secretary issued\nwhat's called the Part 785 guidance. And, in 785.3, it\nsaid, anything that, in 785, contradicts 790, controls.\nAnd 785.38 is the relevant citation. And there they say,\n\"If you show up at the beginning of the day and you're\ngiven instructions, or you show up at the beginning of the\nday and you get a set of tools, what follows after that,\nin terms of travel time, is compensable.\"\nCan I answer two -- make two other very quick\npoints? Justice Ginsburg, you asked about mootness. I\nwould refer you to the Deposit Guarantee case, 445 U.S.\n326, which talks about collateral estoppel effects. There\nis ongoing litigation against this defendant on this\nquestion, a case called Chavez, in the district court.\nThe citation for the proposition that it will collaterally\nestop them is the restatement section of judgments,\nsection --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't questioning that, so\nmuch as it is -- it is extraordinary for this Court to\ntake a case when the bottom line is going to be the same.\nAnd, since we have the identical issues, with no such\npreliminary question in Tum, if we decide in your favor in\nthe Tum case, then the other case is taken care of.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's true, you could dig the\ncase. My only point is that it is not moot. And perhaps\nthe variety of workplaces shown in the two cases would\nillustrate things for the lower courts. I suspect that\nmay have been why the Court granted cert.\nI also wanted to respond to the suggestion that\nthis is a surprise to industry, with just a couple of\ncitations. Walking and waiting time has been held\ncompensable since at least 1961. The Mitchell case, 286\nF.2d 721, the Barrentine case, 750 F.2d 47. There was a\nmeatpacking plant at least seven years ago, 127 F.3d 959.\nAnd this has been the agency's enforcement position at\nleast since the late 1980s. It's sufficiently settled\nthat the court of appeals here held that IBP's failure to\npay for this time was a willful violation of the statute.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldstein.\nMr. Gornstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Portal Act excludes walking time from\ncompensation only when it occurs outside the workday,\nbefore an employee commences, or after he ceases, his\nprincipal activities. And Steiner held that the term\n\"principal activities\" includes activities that are an\nintegral and indispensable part of the principal\nactivities. It follows that when donning and doffing are\nintegral and indispensable parts of the principal\nactivities of the employees, then walking that occurs\nafter donning, and before doffing, occurs within the\nworkday, and it is not excluded from compensation by the\nPortal Act.\nNow, the employers in these cases have argued\nthat the term \"principal activities\" does not encompass\nactivities that are integral and indispensable parts\nthereof, and that Steiner did not so hold. But, at the\nvery outset of its opinion, the Court, in Steiner, posed\nthe question presented as whether changing clothes and\nshowering are compensable as part of the employee's\nprincipal activities, and had answered that question\nseveral pages later by stating that it agreed with the\nconclusion of the court of appeals in that case that the\nterm \"principal activities\" includes activities that are\nan integral and indispensable part of the principal\nactivities, and that the activities in question in that\ncase fit within that description.\nNow, that was the only textual basis on which\nthe Court could have reached the conclusion that it did,\nbecause, if the only principal activities in that case had\noccurred on the production floor, then the changing of\nclothes at the beginning of the day, and the showering at\nthe end of the day, necessarily would have been\npreliminary to and postliminary to said principal\nactivities, and thereby expressly excluded from\ncompensation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if I think that opinion\nwas just flatly wrong, that Congress, when it referred to\nthe \"principal activity or activities,\" was talking about\nthe cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the\nperson to do? He didn't hire him to put on clothes. What\nif I think that? Why do I have to extend what I think to\nbe an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, we are not\nasking for an extension of what you would regard as an\nerroneous holding. All we're saying is that you read the\nterm \"principal activities\" as the Court interpreted it in\nSteiner. Once you do that, and you plug it into the\nstatute, the plain language of the statute takes over,\nbecause it says that walking is only excluded when it\ncomes before the employee commences, or after he ceases,\nthe principal activities. Once you plug \"integral and\nindispensable\" into that sentence, as Steiner requires,\nthen you are -- the plain language of the statute tells\nyou that that time is not -- is compensable when it occurs\nafter donning and before doffing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't I say that Steiner\nrequires that interpretation of what constitutes a\n\"principal activity\" only for purposes of determining what\nis compensable, and that when we -- when we come to\nexamine the separate question, of when the workday begins,\nwe can -- we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned,\na different interpretation of what is a \"principal\nactivity\"?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Because the term \"principal\nactivity,\" I believe, as, you yourself, pointed out, is\nlisted in the first -- at (a)(1). That's the first place\nit appears. Everywhere else it appears, including in\n(a)(2) and in the concluding sentence, it says \"said\nprincipal activities.\" So, the statute itself tells you\nthat the term \"principal activities\" has to mean the same\nthing everywhere it appears. And since you have already\ninterpreted that term, in Steiner, to include \"integral\nand indispensable activities,\" that terminology has to\nappear everywhere in the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gornstein, do you\nagree that just because it's a compensable activity\ndoesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a\nbreak in the workday? People have talked about the dog\nexample, and there are others. I mean, and -- so, all\nyou're talking about is the determination that this is a\nprincipal activity. It seems that there's a separate --\nsecond question, which is, How do we tell if the space in\ntime between two different principal activities, and\nthey're two very different types of activities, is a break\nor part of the continuous workday?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, first of all, that\nquestion arises not under the Portal Act, which only\napplies before the principal activities begin and after\nthey end, but under the Fair Labor Standards Act, itself.\nAnd that question would be governed by the Court's prior\ndecisions on what constitutes hours worked, together with\nthe Department of Labor's regulations that address what\nconstitute hours worked. And -- within the workday -- and\nwhat the Department of Labor has said is, generally,\neverything within the workday is compensable, except for a\nmeal period and except for a time period where there is a\nbreak that is so substantial that the employees can\neffectively use that time for their own purposes. And so,\nit says things like 5- to 20-minute breaks are not periods\nwhere the employee is not working, but they are resting\nfor the further work. That is common in the industry.\nAnd so, that would be an issue that would arise when you\nhad a break that was much longer than that, probably at\nleast a half hour, where you can actually effectively use\nthat time for your own purposes and are not required,\nessentially, to stay around on the employer's premises and\nto wait or rest to begin your work anew. So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you then agree that\nthe answer for which you argue here follows not merely\nfrom the text of 4(a), but the text of 4(a) plus a\ncontinuous -- some variety of a continuous workday rule.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You've got to have both.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That you -- that you have to\nhave a work under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and\nthen you have to have the exclusion from that not apply.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The issue here, the exclusion\ndoesn't apply, and nobody has raised the question about\nwhether this is hours worked under the Fair Labor\nStandards Act. But clearly it is, under the Court's\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't -- but you don't\nget the answer from simply the text itself.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you say --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Gornstein, what about in\nthe Tum case, the walking and waiting before the donning\nof the clothes?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. On the -- on the waiting\nbefore the clothes, there's -- there are two series of\nwaits: the first wait and then later waits. As to the\nlater waits, once you decide that the donning begins the\nprocess of principal activities --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm talking about the --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The initial wait.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- these. The initial.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The initial wait --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't think that's\ncovered.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: We do think that's covered. And\nunder -- the Department of Labor's approach is to treat a\nrequired wait for an activity as an integral part of that\nactivity. So, if that activity is, itself, compensable as\na principal activity, then the required wait for that\nwould also be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the word --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- compensable as part of that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"required\" is what I didn't\nunderstand in that. My airline example, what's required?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: What the -- the Department\ndistinguishes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Required\" is -- sometimes\nthere's a wait, sometimes there's not a wait. Is that\nrequired?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if the employee is simply\nvoluntarily arriving earlier than --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He has to --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- he has to and wait --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- put on his uniform. And\nsometimes there's a wait, sometimes there's --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: When --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- not a wait.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that a required -- or not?\nAnd, if it is, where does it say that in the regs?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It's a required wait anytime, in\norder to get to the production floor on time, the employee\nhas to be at the donning station in a sufficient period of\ntime to get there, and if there's a wait at that time,\nthen he's being required to wait.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein acknowledged\nthat that issue, the predonning wait, was not decided\nbelow.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not sure I view that the --\nthe question as not having been decided below. And the\nCourt also did grant certiorari on waiting time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't, obviously,\ndecided in the first circuit, because they ruled against\nthe employee's position.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But they said \"a reasonable\nperiod of time for waiting\" is non-compensable. And that,\nat least as a general rule, is not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the question\nof when -- what waiting are we talking about? Before the\nprincipal activity or only after? That specific issue, as\nI understand it, was not aired below.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I'm -- my memory, at\nleast, of the court of appeals opinion, is that it was\nsaying that the wait before the donning was not\ncompensable, because it was a preliminary activity. But I\n-- if you've read it differently, then that may be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do we have to decide the second\nquestion? I think it's actually quite difficult. I can\nfind a lot of authority that seems to me just --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The Court always has discretion\nnot to decide --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- the question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't mean that.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, is there -- is there a\nbasis in this record -- will it make a difference? It's\nnot really well briefed, I don't think.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not thoroughly briefed.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Breyer, if you do not\nwant to decide that question, you don't have to decide it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't do things on the ground\n--\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The Court granted --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I'd like it or not.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- certiorari as an issue that\ncan be, and should be, resolved, in our view. But if the\nCourt doesn't want to resolve that issue, that's fine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gornstein, one thing I'm\ncurious about. With all the trouble of various\ninterpretations and famous footnote 49 --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: 49.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why, in all these years,\nhasn't the Department of Labor gotten rid of it?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It should have. Because even at\nthe time it was written, that reservation was in tension\nor not in conflict with the plain language of the\nregulations. And certainly by the time of Steiner, it was\nclear that this kind of time was compensable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGornstein.\nMr. Phillips, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I\njust have a couple of points I'd like to make.\nFirst, Justice Breyer, I want to start with the\nwaiting times. I didn't actually have an opportunity to\nspend much time talking about them. But I think the\nanswer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered\nwith respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the\nexpandable nature of the workday. Their position --\nJustice Ginsburg -- or, no Justice O'Connor specifically asked\nthat question, \"You're not saying that waiting time prior\nto engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the\nworkday.\" And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because\nthey find that everything that is integral and\nindispensable triggers the start of the workday. So, to put\nit into fairly graphic terms. If you have to show up in\norder to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in\norder to do your services, then the waiting time for that\ncoat counts. If, however, you also have to put in\nearplugs in order to get to the place where you have to\nget the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count,\nunder that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have\nthat, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking\nin between there.\nSo, if you're asking, \"Is this going to become a\nsignificant liability?\" the answer is clearly yes. For\nvery significant compensable acts -- and, indeed, in this\ncontext, some of those compensable acts were found by the\njury to be utterly diminimus -- you're going to end up\nwith significant waiting time, and you're going to end up\nwith significant walking time.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the predonning waiting\nissue decided below?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice O'Connor, they\nspecifically held that all of the waiting time is not --\nit is to be excluded. And they did that on the basis of\n790.7(g), before you get to the footnote -- because that's\nthe tag to the footnote -- as to what is -- what is the\nordinary meaning of wait -- of preliminary and\npostliminary for waiting time? And the expectation is\nthat if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're\nwaiting to check in, the recognition is that those --\nthose are completely fortuitous, just as it is here.\nThere's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you\nwill end up spending time waiting. Indeed, the scheme is\ndesigned to get people in as efficiently --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They decided --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- as possible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- no waiting time. They\ndidn't decide \"if\" waiting time -- \"which\" waiting time.\nBut they said no -- it's irrelevant whether it's before or\nafter, because waiting time isn't covered. So, I don't\nsee how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is\ncovered, but not --.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,\nif they specifically decide that there is no waiting time\nthat's covered here, and the plaintiffs have sought\ncompensation for both pre- and post-waiting time, then the\nissue is squarely posed, and they've certainly posed it in\ntheir petition, and the Court granted it. So, again,\nobviously, you're free to decline to decide issues, but it\nseems to me that one is posed.\nI want to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems the court\nbelow said waiting time isn't covered, so we're not going\nto engage in any debate about what -- if waiting time is -\n- were covered, which waiting time?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but that just goes to the\nquestion -- I think it disposes of the issue of, if you\nhave waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly\nordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it,\nnevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under\ntheir interpretation of the statute. And they clearly\nsuggest that the answer is yes. Our suggestion is, that's\ninconsistent with the way waiting time is handled under\nthe regulations; and, therefore, the answer clearly should\nbe no. And, at a minimum, the Court ought to affirm that\npart of the Tum decision.\nWith respect to the holding of Steiner -- I\nmean, it's important to put in mind, Steiner -- one of the\nthings -- two things that Steiner focused on -- it focused\non section 3.0, and it recognized that there are going to\nbe situations where you're going to be able to bargain\naway clothes changing. And so, now you're in a situation\nwhere, for some -- for -- in some circumstances, because\nyou've bargained away compensation for clothes changing,\nwalking that takes place before or after that will never\nbe compensable; in other situations, it will be\ncompensable. That's an absurd outcome in a situation\nwhere Congress clearly had one thing in mind that it\nabsolutely wanted to accomplish, and that was to ensure\nthat walking, riding, traveling to the place where you\nactually perform the services for which you've been hired,\nhas been -- has -- is excluded from being mandatorily\ncompensated -- Steiner doesn't deal with 4(a)(1); the\nlanguage is as plain as it can be -- are not -- you know,\nunless specifically excluded by section 4(a)(1).\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\n"
