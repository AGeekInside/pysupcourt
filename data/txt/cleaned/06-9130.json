        "content": "(11:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 069130 Ali versus Federal Bureau of\nPrisons.\nMr. Andre.\nMR. ANDRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the court:\nThe text of Section 26 (a)(c)Federal court\nclaims act establishes -- provision underlying purpose\nconfirm that Congress did not intend the provision to\nbroadly bar all claims arising out of all the tensions\nof all property by all law enforcement officers. As in\nany statutory construction case we need to of course\nbegin with the text, and with respect to the text in\nthis case, we believe that the statutory language is\nsimply no different than the statutory at issue at\nCircuit City v. Adams. Circuit City v. Adams this court\napplied a ejusdem generis to limit a sweepingly broad\nresidual phrase that is meaningfully indistinguishable\nfrom the \"any other law enforcement phrase\" at issue\nhere. In particular, in Circuit City the court was\nasked what kinds of employment contracts were exempted\nfrom the mandates of the Federal Arbitration Act. The\nparticular provision at issue in that case 9 U.S.C.\nSection 1 exempted from the act's coverage any and I\nquote contracts of employment of sea men, railroad\nemployees or any other class of workers engaged in\nforeign or interstate commerce. That residual phrase\nread in isolation is broad and sweeping on its face it\ncertainly would appear to apply not only to\ntransportation workers, but also to retail store clerks\nlike the Respondent in Circuit City, none the less under\na ejusdem generis, this court limited that residual\nphrase to just to transportation workers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there is a\ndifference between a sufficient laundry list in a\nresidual phrase and example in a residual phrase. In\nCircuit City you have a couple of examples -- seamen,\nrailroad workers -- here it's just a customs or excise\nworker. I regard customs and excise as kind of the same\nthing. So why isn't it more like the cases where we've\nsaid you have an example in a residual phrase; the\nexample is not limiting.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nif I could point out that if the Government had made the\nargument that you have to have a list, and I think under\nthe Government's interpretation you had to have at least\nthree items, two specific and one general. In Norfolk\n-- Norfolk and Western Railway, this Court says that\nneed not be the case. There the Court said that you\ncould have a singular general term preceded by a\nsingular specific term. So it's our position that --\nthat even if you were to read this statute as -- as\npossessing only two items, that you could still apply\nejusdem generis, but we don't read the statute that way.\nWe believe that the statute actually contains a list of\nthree items, and that Congress to save itself a couple\nwords, decided to say \"any officer of customs or excise,\nor any other law enforcement officer,\" instead of saying\nthe more wordy version, \"any officer of customs, any\nofficer of excise or any other law enforcement officer.\"\nI don't think we can fault Congress for its pick in that\nscenario.\nTo get back to the residual phrase, the \"any\nother law enforcement officer phrase\" here, ripped from\nits moorings, as we believe the Government is trying to\ndo, would certainly seem to apply to all law enforcement\nofficers, including Bureau of Prisons officials which by\nstatute are law enforcement officers. But Section\n2680(c) contains a number of contextual cues that\nCongress didn't have general law enforcement functions\nin mind when it passed the provision. It had customs\nand tax functions in mind. In particular, the detention\nclause preserves sovereign immunity for the detention of\ngoods and merchandise by any officer of customs or\nexcise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not just goods\nor merchandise. Goods, merchandise or other property.\nAnd does other property include any type of property?\nMR. ANDRE: We believe it does, and we\nbelieve that when Congress added that language it was\nsimply Congress's sensible recognition that customs and\ntax officers will detain or seize cash and real property\nwhich wouldn't be covered or wouldn't be subsumed under\ngoods and merchandise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So \"goods and\nmerchandise or other property\" are just examples, and\nthen a residual phrase that includes everything; but\n\"customs or excise or any other law enforcement\nofficer,\" that's subject to ejusdem generis - all in the\nsame sentence.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, we actually don't think --\nor I guess I cannot necessarily agree with the first\npart of what you just said, Mr. Chief Justice. We don't\nbelieve that -- that other property necessarily, or that\n\"goods and merchandise and other property,\" the goods\nand merchandise are examples of \"other property.\" We\nthink in that situation, goods and merchandise refer\nspecifically to goods and merchandise as -- as explained\nhistorically in the United States Code, which are, you\nknow, more movable things other than cash, tangible\nitems other than cash, and \"other property\" then covers\ncash and real property.\nExcuse me. Getting back to the contextual\ncues in this case, in addition to the four contained in\nthe detention clause itself, the assessment clause\ncontains four additional contextual cues. It preserves\nsovereign immunity for the assessment of any tax or the\ncollection of any customs duty, and because we have this\ngreat quantity of contextual cues in a very short\nstatutory provision, we believe that we would also\nprevail under an application of the Noscitur a sociis\ncanon, that this Court most recently applied two terms\nago in Dolan v. Postal Service. In that case what was\nat issue is whether the term \"negligent transmission\" in\nSection 2680(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act reached\nall negligent transmissions, in particular a parcel left\non the foot of someone's front door that causes them a\nfall injury, or instead, it was limited by its\nantecedent contextual cues, namely -- I'm sorry --\nnamely, loss and miscarriage, which would tend to\nindicate that Congress intended really only to preserve\nsovereign immunity for instances in which delivery was\nuntimely or went to the wrong location. The Court again\nsensibly looked past the superficially broad negligent\ntransmission language and instead said no, we have to\nread it in context; and in context Congress did not\nintend us to just pluck those two words out of the\ndictionary and apply a dictionary meaning.\nIn fact, in that case, the Government\nimplored this Court to apply dictionary definitions to\nnegligence and transmission, and that's essentially what\nthe Government is trying to ask this Court to do here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what do you do\nabout the later -- the later statute that makes an\nexception to the exception?\nMR. ANDRE: We don't believe that that\nchanges -- we don't believe that changes the meaning of\nthe detention cause at all beyond the small change that\nCongress made.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean it clearly, the\nexception to the exception says that -- that the\nexception is applicable to any claim based on injury or\nloss of goods or merchandise, if among other\nrequirements, the property was seized for the purpose of\nforfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing\nfor the forfeiture of property.\nNow that's more than customs and tax -- any\nprovision of Federal law.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you need that\nexception to the exception if the exception doesn't\ncover anything except customs and tax in the first\nplace?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, we believe that the fact\nthat Congress decided to not only preserve the detention\nclause, but also mimic its language in the exception to\nthe exception, means that Congress intended to kind of\nbring forward the -- of course -- original meaning as of\n1946 of that clause. But I think to get what you're\nasking me, the Government's position, that because the\nexception to the exception references any provision of\nforfeiture -- the Government's suggestion that that\nsomehow broadens the scope of the statute is misplaced.\nCustoms and tax officers regularly apply\nother forfeiture statutes, and in particular the one\nthey use a lot is 21 U.S.C. 881. That's the general\ncivil forfeiture statute. And so in many cases they\nwill bring a forfeiture action under either their\nagency's specific forfeiture provision, or the general\n21 U.S.C. 881. And so when Congress included that\nlanguage saying any provision of forfeiture, it was\nsimply Congress's sensible recognition that they don't\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't -- they didn't\nneed that if indeed it covered all seizures by -- by\ncustoms and tax officers and nobody else. If that's all\nit -- it covered, what -- you know, this doesn't achieve\nanything. The purpose of under any provision of Federal\nlaw. It seems to me that that envisions seizure under\nlaws other than tax and customs. Now you're saying\nthere is one, one such law that tax and customs officers\nsometimes use?\nMR. ANDRE: There may be more, I was giving\nyou an example, but the one that I gave you, 21 U.S.C.\n881, is the one most frequently used. It is the general\nforfeiture provision. It's kind of the backbone of all\nforfeitures, and so in many cases officers bring\nforfeiture actions not only either -- either under their\nown agency forfeiture provision or the general.\nSometimes they bring them under both. But the point is\nthat's a meaty statute there, and I -- I assume that\nCongress wanted to make clear that if a customs or tax\nofficer were to bring a forfeiture proceeding under that\nmeaty provision, and maybe some other ones that they\nwould use from time to time, that the exception to the\nexception would still work here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What work does it do? What\nwork under your interpretation does that later provision\ndo, if property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture\nunder any provision of Federal law providing for the\nforfeiture of property?\nMR. ANDRE: Under our interpretation, if a\ncustoms or tax officer or another law enforcement\nofficer acting in a custom or tax capacity detains\nproperty and injures it -- and it doesn't matter under\nwhich forfeiture law they detain the property --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. ANDRE: -- and the plaintiff is\nultimately successful, I'm sorry, I guess -- yes, the\nplaintiff is ultimately successful in defeating the\nGovernment's claim for forfeiture, then they can sue\nunder the FTCA for the damage to their property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Andre, it may be that\nthings would fall into place easier if you would give us\nan example or examples of instances in which any other\nlaw enforcement officer would be engaged in detaining\nproperty in -- in the course of enforcing customs or\nexcise laws. If we can understand that, then we are\ngoing to have a better sense of how the exception might\nwork. Can you give me an example of the other law\nenforcement officer engaged in customs excise?\nMR. ANDRE: Sure. The best example that\ncomes to mind is pre-9/11 before the merger of the INS\nand the Border Patrol -- or I'm sorry, the Customs\nBureau -- under the Department of Homeland Security.\nWhen you drove across the border before 9/11 more often\nthan not you would see a gentleman or a woman in a green\njump suit. They were INS. But not only were they\nasking you questions about your immigration status and\nchecking to see if you had ID; they were also asking\nabout what you were bringing in -- for example, oh, do\nyou have more than two bottles of liquor? Because\nyou're only allowed to bring in two. And if you said\nyes, they would direct you over to secondary inspection,\nand even there in secondary inspection certainly\nsometimes there may have been officers in blue suits,\nthe customs enforcement officers. But more often than\nnot, they were still officers in green suits, INS\nofficers. And there they're taking this extra property\nfrom you because they believe you are not supposed to\nhave it, and then sending you on your way.\nThere are many task forces in many other\ninstances in which officers can overlap or share\nfunctions, postal inspectors working with the customs\nenforcement agencies to keep --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say IRS officers,\nbecause they would be covered? It's tax and customs.\nMR. ANDRE: Right. We believe IRS officers\nare expressly covered, but, for example, when the FBI is\nconducting an investigation with the IRS into fraud and\nother tax issues, then we believe that those FBI agents\nwould be covered.\nSo we don't believe it's hard at all to find\na number of examples of where other law enforcement\nofficers are assisting tax and customs officers,\nstanding in the shoes of tax and customs officers, or\njust doing something sufficiently akin to what tax and\ncustoms officers do. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You gave an example in\nyour brief that didn't seem to fit. I mean you spoke of\na DEA agent who was searching for narcotics, and that\nsounds to me like what DEA agents do. They were not\nauxiliary to a customs officer.\nMR. ANDRE: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. That's the Formula One case out of the Second\nCircuit. And the reason why we relied on that case is\nbecause the DEA agents were opening up a shipping\ncontainer that had not yet been opened since it came\nfrom overseas.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were doing it\nfor their primary business, which was to detect\nnarcotics.\nMR. ANDRE: That's right. And we again\nreference that case because we wanted to offer the Court\na broad construction or make sure the Court was\ncomfortable in knowing that we were comfortable with the\n\"other law enforcement officer\" phrase being read\nbroadly to reach any -- you know, any loose tax or\ncustoms function.\nIf the Court wants to construe that phrase\nmore narrowly, we still win this case, and we have no\nproblem if the Court wants to do that. But we think\nthat, given that the residual phrase of the detention\nclause starts out with the word \"any,\" the way to give\n-- to give credence to Congress's use of that word is to\nthen construe the phrase as reaching conduct such as the\nconduct in the Formula One case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could we interpret the term\n\"law enforcement\" -- \"any other law enforcement officer\"\nto be limited to those law enforcement officers whose\nduties generally include the detention of goods?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, I don't think so, Justice\nAlito, because we weren't really prepared to debate what\nexactly \"detention\" means. In fact, we didn't petition\non that issue, and my client didn't press it below. But\nwe were just intuitively thinking -- I don't think the\nword \"detention\" does much work for us here, at least in\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why doesn't it? It's\nnot clear to me. Maybe this is not within the question,\nbut why were your client's goods detained? \"Detention\"\nseems to connote holding the goods against the wishes of\nthe owner, and that wasn't the situation here. He gave\nthose goods -- he gave them to the Bureau of Prisons\nofficer for the purpose of having them sent on to his\nnew prison.\nMR. ANDRE: I agree. I should have been\nmore clear.\nWe don't believe that the word \"detention\"\nnecessarily sheds a lot of light on how you construe\nwhat \"other law enforcement officer\" means, but\ncertainly, yeah, we believe that if the detention issue\nwere alive in this case, we have a very strong case,\nbecause there's a very passive kind of bailment here, as\nyou referenced, where our -- my client was, you know,\ntold to leave his property with a receiving/discharge\nclerk and go to a new institution, and the property was\ngoing to follow him along. There was no seizure. There\nwas no investigation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you don't think that\nconcept sheds light on what Congress had in mind when it\nreferred to any other Federal law enforcement officer?\nMR. ANDRE: I -- I don't, but I don't want\nto resist you too much either. You know, if the Court\nwould like us to reach that issue, we'd be happy to\nbrief if the Court wanted to issue an order akin to the\none it issued last term in U.S. v. Resendiz-Ponce.\nAnd I think to get more directly to what\nyou're saying, whatever Congress intended as far as\nother law enforcement officers, the fact that we have a\ncase here where, again, there is this very passive\nbailment by a Bureau of Prisons receiving/discharge\nclerk, I think exemplifies how the government's\nconstruction of the statute is too broad. And I think\nthat might be what you were trying to tease out of me\nthere.\nAnd to get back to the government's\nconstruction, we believe that their construction would\nrender a number of words in this statute superfluous,\nwhich is sort of our third textual reason for reading\nthe statute our way. The detention clause contains a\ntotal of 22 words. Under the government's construction\nit would simply read: \"Any detention of any property by\nany law enforcement officer.\" Fourteen words would be\nexcised right out of the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, I mean that's\nalways true when you have an example and a more general\nphrase. And yet our cases indicate that we often read\nthe language that way.\nIn other words, it's giving you, perhaps,\nthe most common example in which you're going to have a\ndetention of goods, but it's not limiting it to those\nofficers.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, there certainly are some\ncases that would appear to go both ways, although I\nthink if you take a look at the cases cited by the\ngovernment, those cases involve pretty -- I realize we\nhave an unclear, bizarre statute here as well, but those\nare pretty bizarre statutes the government is relying on\nwhere the Court has, and more often than not, it has\nalso been as an alternative statement, you could even\nsay possibly dicta, where the Court has said, oh,\nCongress can give examples.\nBut more often than not, the Court applies\nthe ejustem generis canon and the noscitur a sociis\ncanon to confine or limit a superficially broad residual\nphrase. And if that weren't the case, then Gutierrez v.\nAda would have come out the other way, Dolan v. Postal\nService, of course, Circuit City.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but S.D. Marine\nwouldn't have come out the other way.\nMR. ANDRE: That's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was that an obscure\nstatute in S.D. Marine?\nMR. ANDRE: I'm sorry. I'm not that\nfamiliar with the statute that we have in that case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't the word, as\nyour brother argues, doesn't \"any\" cut against you? If\nthey intended the other law enforcement officer to be\nlimited to similar to customs or excise, it seems to me\nthey wouldn't have thrown in \"any other law enforcement\nofficer.\"\nMR. ANDRE: Well, as kind of a practical\nmatter, we don't think that when you have a statute like\nthis, the word \"any\" really does a lot of work. I mean\nif you had taken out the word \"any\" and instead\npluralized the word \"officer,\" I don't think the statute\nreally would work any differently.\nBut even taking -- taking as true this\nCourt's oft-repeated statement that \"any\" is evidence of\nexpansive meaning by Congress, we believe our\nconstruction is faithful to that, because we are willing\nto bring in to our construction of the statute some of\nthese other law enforcement officers who may be\nperforming their ordinary functions, such as DEA\nofficers, enforcement of drug laws, but they are doing\nit akin to customs laws.\nAnd again, the Court need not adopt that\nconstruction for us to prevail in this case. But that's\nhow we believe that our construction is faithful to the\nword \"any\" to the extent that in this statute it's\nrelevant at all.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, following up on\nJustice Alito's question, has there ever been a debate\nin earlier stages in this litigation as to whether this\nwas a detention?\nMR. ANDRE: No, there was not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because if it were not a\ndetention, then you'd win.\nMR. ANDRE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering why you\ndidn't make the argument somewhere along the line.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, my client was pro se in\nthe Court of Appeals, and he didn't raise it there. And\nto be -- again, we didn't think that the issue of\nwhether a detention had to be a seizure, something more\nforceful, or whether it was so broad as to include more\nof a passive bailment like we have here, we didn't\nbelieve that that issue had percolated enough in the\ncourts of appeals to warrant petitioning on. So we\nfigured we'd fight this fight here today.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is clear -- there\nare so many exceptions from exceptions from exceptions,\nthat you get a little mixed up, but I am clear, am I\nnot, that if it were not a detention, you would win?\nMR. ANDRE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Everybody agrees.\nMR. ANDRE: If there was not a detention or\nif the BOP guard was not an any other law enforcement,\nwe would win under either two of those independent\nanalyses.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also not clear\nthat under the government's -- I guess I should ask\nthem, but I got it right in front of me now -- if you\ndeleted the words \"officer of customs or exercise or any\nother,\" if you just took those words out of the statute,\nit would then mean exactly what the government contends\nit means?\nMR. ANDRE: That's exactly right. And\nthat's why we believe that the rule against superfluity\nis another reason why our construction is more faithful\nto Congress's intent in this case.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, we also\nbelieve that the legislative history underlying purposes\nfor this particular provision support our reading. In\nparticular, I realize the legislative history is pretty\nsparse, but in particular, there were six congressional\ncommittee reports issued by Congress after the detention\nclause was expanded to essentially its current form.\nAnd in all six of those reports, Congress\nconspicuously omitted to make any reference to the fact\nthat this phrase could possibly reach the detentions of\nall property by all law enforcement officers.\nNow, we're not suggesting that this case is\nat all like Arlington v. Murphy, for example, where we\nare going to have legislative history try to overrule a\nclear statutory text. I think it's pretty clear that\nthis text is ambiguous, and so legislative history is\nrelevant to give that text meaning.\nAnd so the reason why we focus here on those\nparticular committee reports is, as the Court of Appeals\nhas stated, the committee reports are the most helpful\nform of legislative history because when many members of\nCongress go up to vote, they haven't parsed particular\nprovisions in the text; they rely on the committee\nreports, the reports prepared by the committee that\nmarked up and presented the language to the floor. And\nso, if when all those members --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the President\ndoesn't rely on those when he signs the statute into\nlaw.\nMR. ANDRE: No. That's true, Your Honor.\nBut when those members typically go up to the floor and\nvote, they oftentimes don't parse the language. They\nrely on the committee reports.\nAnd so if the government's construction were\ncorrect here, essentially what you would have is all of\nthose members' votes being overridden because they\ncouldn't possibly have known -- unless they took the\ntime to parse the text and we all know that a lot of\ntimes they don't -- they wouldn't possibly know that\nthere'd be any chance whatsoever that this phrase could\nbroadly reach the detention of property by all law\nenforcement officers. Even putting that kind of\nlegislative history argument aside, I think we're -- our\nstrongest footing, when we talk about how our\nconstruction is faithful to Congress's underlying\npurpose for this particular provision, on three\noccasions, this Court has either suggested or expressly\nstated that the purpose for this particular provision\nwas to avoid the creation of a redundant federally\nfunded remedy. As we explain in our opening brief,\nthere was a pre-existing federally funded remedy only\nfor the negligent conduct of tax and customs officers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that still exist\nafter the Westfall Act?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, we believe it would if --\nwell, actually that's a very good question. I'm not\nsure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because now, the -- there\nwouldn't be -- the United States would be substituted --\nMR. ANDRE: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for the agent's\nabuses.\nMR. ANDRE: Right, but then in that\nsituation, once the United States substituted, they\ncould seek dismissal because the Westfall Act doesn't\noverride any exceptions to the FTCA. So, yes, Justice\nGinsburg, in that particular case, if you're dealing\nwith an officer of customs or tax or another law\nenforcement acting in that capacity, and they were sued\npersonally for the negligent handling of property, the\ngovernment could certify they're acting within the scope\nof their employment, step into the case, and then move\nto dismiss under this provision, under 2680(c).\nBut, historically, there was -- before the\nWestfall Act, there was a pre-existing federally funded\nremedy for only officers acting in a tax or customs\ncapacity or customs or tax officers by name. And so it\nwould be inconsistent with Congress's underlying purpose\nto avoid creating a duplicative remedy to apply its\nprovisions so broadly because Congress wanted to provide\na cause of action for claims against law enforcement\nofficers other than those against whom a cause of action\nwas already available.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do we know -- how do we\nknow that that's the only purpose of this exception?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, as I mentioned, this Court\nsuggested in Kosak that that was the only only purpose,\nbut then in Hatzlachh and in Gutierrez v. Martinez, this\nCourt twice stated that that was the only purpose, and\nthe Court did so for good reason. Again, although the\nlegislative history is sparse, the only statements\nwhatsoever in the legislative record about the purpose\nfor this particular provision was that Congress was\nintending to avoid creating a duplicative remedy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: This is all based on Judge\nHoltzoff's testimony? That's the basis for the\nconclusion that this is the only purpose for this\nexception?\nMR. ANDRE: And it's also based on the\ntestimony of Colonel O.R. McGuire, who is general\ncounsel for the Comptroller General. And it wasn't just\nJudge -- well, Judge Holtzoff was probably the architect\nof the detention clause and maybe this entire provision.\nIt was the Comptroller General's Office, and Judge\nHoltzoff who jointly were responsible for preparing tort\nclaims legislation. So, essentially, of the two people\nwho were most relevant to the preparation of the FTCA,\nand granted we're talking 15 years before its actual\nenactment, but two people who were most important for\npreparing this tort claims legislation, they both agreed\nthat the only purpose for this particular provision was\nto avoid creating a redundant remedy.\nI'd like to save the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Andre. Mr. Shanmugam.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nSection 2680(c) preserves the government's\nimmunity against tort claims concerning the detention of\nproperty by any law enforcement officer. That reading\nis consistent not only with the plain language of the\nstatute but also with Congress's underlying policy\nobjectives in creating the FTCA's exception.\nPetitioner effectively asks this Court to engraft\nlanguage on to the statute by adding the amorphous\nlimitation \"acting in a customs or tax capacity\" to the\nunambiguous statutory phrase \"any other law enforcement\nofficer.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, may I ask\nyou -- this goes to your ambiguity point. May I ask you\nthis question? If Congress wanted to cover all law\nofficers, the only reason for mentioning the customs and\nexcise people would be to make it very clear that they\nwere within that category of all law enforcement\nofficers, and I take it that's basically what you're\nsaying.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, I think that's correct\nwith one caveat, Justice Souter, and I don't mean to\nquibble, but I think that this is important. I think\nwhen one looks at the evolution of the statute, it may\nvery well have that when Judge Holtzoff drafted the\nrelevant statutory language, he started with customs or\nexcise officers because the British bill that was\napparently the model for the detention of property\nclause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- used that phrase, and he\nmay then have decided to expand it to other law\nenforcement officers simply because he concluded that\nthere was no basis for treating other law enforcement\nofficers differently.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But wouldn't --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But wouldn't the way to do\nthat would have made it at least clearer that that's\nwhat Congress or what he had in mind and what Congress\nwas getting at would have been to provide that the --\nthat the exception referred to law enforcement officers\nincluding an officer or customs of excise? In other\nwords, they would have made it clear that at that point,\nthe old historical customs and excise rule was sort of\nthe tail on the dog, and the dog was law enforcement\nofficers. Instead, however, the order is exactly\ndifferent. On what your reading is -- on your reading,\nwhat is now the tail of the dog comes first, and the\ngeneral clause \"law enforcement officer\" comes second.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, number one, it is less\nclear and it really raises the question: Weren't they\ntrying to get simply at law enforcement officers who\nwere doing the customs and excise function? So my\nquestion is, why doesn't the order of the words cut\nagainst you by putting, on your theory, the tail of the\ndog before the dog?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Souter, it is\ncertainly true that Congress could have written that\nstatute that way and indeed could have omitted the\ncustoms or excise officers entirely, and that certainly\nwould be a clearer statute in the sense that I don't\nthink that Mr. Andre would be here if we had a statute\nthat simply referred to any law enforcement officer.\nBut the United States Code is replete with\nprovisions that fit this model, that start with specific\nexamples and then contain a general residual clause.\nAnd, indeed, even the Constitution has similar\nprovisions. To take one concrete example that we cite\namong the many examples in footnote 11 of our brief, the\nExtradition Clause in Article IV of the Constitution\nrefers to extradition for treason, felonies, and other\ncrimes, and there is no doubt that the framers could\nhave simply referred to crimes, but they cited those\nexamples. As this Court held in a case way back when,\nKentucky v. Denyson, the reason that Congress used those\nexamples was for emphasis to make clear that political\ncrimes such as treason and other felonies that would\nqualify as political crimes were covered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's also --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's also not entirely\nclear what -- whether it's a tail or not. It depends on\nwhat the dog is. If you can -- if you were trying to\nidentify the most common instances, especially at the\ntime this provision was enacted, the most common\ninstances in which property was detained by the\ngovernment, I mean you know, later -- later forfeiture\nprovisions are numerous, but at that time I think they\nwere relatively few. I think the dog would have been --\nwould have been customs and excise officers. And the\n\"or other officers\" would have picked up probably very\nlittle real -- real instances of property detention.\nMR.SHANMUGAM: Assuming for present\npurposes, Justice Scalia, that the dog here is any\nofficer of customs or excise, I think that the critical\npoint is that the tail was indeed smaller than it would\nbe today because customs and excise officers were among\nthe most important federal law enforcement officers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: You know --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but -- but a short\ntime ago you said there was no basis for distinguishing\nbetween excise officers and all other law enforcement\nofficers. But there was indeed a basis for it, namely\nthat there was an alternative remedy for people\nspecifically named in the statute, which is not true of\nall other officers. It's true now, but it wasn't then.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe, first of\nall, that if one looks at this Court's decision in\nKosak, the Court did not in any way suggest that the\navailability of alternative remedies was the sole\npurpose --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not suggesting that,\nbut that is a reason for drawing a distinction between\nall others and this particular claim.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Stevens, it\ncertainly was one of Congress's primary purposes in\ncreating the exceptions generally, but we do believe\nthat our interpretation of the statute serves that\npurpose, albeit to a lesser extent perhaps than it\nserves the other congressional purposes, but that was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It didn't serve that\npurpose before 2000.\nMR.SHANMUGAM: It did serve that purpose,\nJustice Stevens, because there was an alternative\nremedy, albeit one that was not federally funded and\nthat was a common-law action against a law enforcement\nofficer in his personal capacity for negligence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wasn't it federally\nfunded? I thought there was a provision for\nindemnification.\nMR.SHANMUGAM: There was a provision for\nindemnification for revenue officers and other officers\nessentially acting in a revenue capacity, I believe that\nthe exact statutory language was \"collectors and other\nrevenue officers\" -- and that indemnification provision,\nto be sure, would not have applied to garden variety law\nenforcement officers.\nBut in looking at the availability of\nalternative remedies, this Court has never suggested\nthat whether that congressional purpose is served\nsomehow turns on whether the money came directly from an\nofficer or whether it came from the Federal fisc. And\nPetitioner in his reply brief cites Dolan for that\nproposition but whether the alternative remedy was\nfederally funded was simply not at issue in Dolan. At\nmost the Court concluded that the alternative remedy\navailable there was insufficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you actually have any\ninformation about the early 1940s, about who was a\nFederal law enforcement officer? I think the FBI, the\nBureau of Prisons -- there were a lot of people being\ndetained. There were goods that were having to do with\ncontraband, foreign goods, maybe domestic, things you\nweren't supposed to have, food stamps. Illegal\nrations -- OPA -- I mean, you know, there were, you were\nonly supposed to have so much food.\nHave we any notion who other law enforcement\nofficers might have applied to at that time?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It's very difficult to\nquantify, Justice Breyer, but I do think we have some\nsense historically of the state of play at various law\nenforcement agencies; and the FBI was in a relatively\nnascent stage in 1946. I think the FBI dates from\napproximately the turn of the 20th century. Certainly\nthe Bureau of Prisons, while it existed, was detaining\nfar fewer people than it does now.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think the FBI had quite a\nbig job in World War II.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It did. To be sure, but\nthere were not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought there were\nthousands and thousands and thousands of FBI people.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So do we know? I'm getting\nfrom you that you don't know and I don't know. Is that\nright?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yeah. I don't have exact\nnumbers. I attempted to find them out. But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We don't even have a\nballpark.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I can't offer you a\nballpark, but I think what I can say, and this accords\nwith observations that various members of this Court\nhave made over the years, is that there were simply far\nfewer Federal criminal provisions then than there are\nnow, and I think that that is one of the reasons why\nwe've really seen an explosion in the number of these\ncases as time has gone on, while the FTCA --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, well that might be.\nBut I'm sitting in Congress, I read this statute, I\nthink maybe they were talking about customs people and\nthe like. Now, there is this other word in there,\nthat's true. So we look up, where does the other word\ncome from? The other word comes from Judge Holtzoff.\nHe explained it, we don't have to guess. We can read\nhis explanation. His explanation comes in a paragraph\nhaving to do with customs and excise, and beginning\nwith, I'm talking about customs and excise, and the\nadditional proviso as special reference, where they use\nthis phrase, and then he says it's all supposed to be\nlike the Crown Proceedings Committee in England in 1927,\nwhich in fact had nothing to do with anybody but customs\nand excise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do the members of Congress\nwho voted on this language, when it was presented to\nthem, did they even know who Judge Holtzoff was?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, they may very well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did he testify to this\neffect before one of the committees?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: He did testify before one of\nthe committees. He did not address this specific issue,\nbut as this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 15 years before it was\npassed, right?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: 15 years before it was\npassed, Judge Holtzoff wrote this report, and as both\nthe majority and Justice Stevens in his dissenting\nopinion in Kosak observed, there was no evidence that\nthis report was even introduced into the legislative\nrecord.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if it was not -- I\nmean, I would suspect at that time Judge Holtzoff was a\npretty well known person in the legal community and I\nwould suspected if we are guessing at such a thing that\nquite a few did know who he was. And I suspect that\nwhen Congress passes a technical bill, they are\ninterested in the views of the Department of Justice and\nthese were those views.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. I want to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if we are going to play\na magic game that we don't pay attention to what sheds\nlight on it, fine, then we don't, but I would.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nwanted simply to make the point that in the pantheon of\nlegislative history sources for those members of the\nCourt who are interested in legislative history, we\nrecognized that the Holtzoff report should not be\nafforded great weight. But that having been said, I\nwant to address directly the language you cite from the\nHoltzoff report, because I believe that that language if\nanything supports our position, and not Petitioners,\nbecause in the relevant sentence of the Holtzoff report,\nJudge Holtzoff wrote that the additional proviso,\nmeaning the detention of property clause, has special\nreference to the detention of imported goods in\nappraisers' warehouses or customs houses as well as\nseizures by law enforcement officials, Internal Revenue\nofficers and the like. Now Petitioner --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any\nlegislative history about what Judge Holtzoff meant by\nthat?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, one could make the\nargument that that legislative history is itself\nambiguous; and indeed the D.C. Circuit in adopting\nPetitioner's construction itself acknowledged that at\nbest, the legislative history was as unclear as the\nstatute.\nAll I mean to suggest is that Petitioner\ndoes not have available to him any sort of ejusdem\ngeneris argument in construing that sentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I think in reading\nthat, I think that's a good point. My actual reading of\nit, of that paragraph 2, is that it's not free of\nambiguity. I completely agree with you. And if I read\nthrough it, then I'm making up my mind as a judge, well,\nhow do I feel about what these words likely show and how\npeople in Congress would have interpreted that kind of\nreference or statement in testimony by a person who\nthought this? Free of ambiguity, I agree with you, it\nisn't. But it might cut somewhat more in favor of the\nPetitioners than the Respondents.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think, Justice\nBreyer, with all respect, that this is not a case in\nwhich very much of a conclusion can be drawn from the\nlegislative history one way or another. We have this\nlanguage from the Holtzoff report which I admit, you\nknow, could be susceptible to the same sorts of\narguments that Petitioner is making with regard to what\nwe feel is the unambiguous language of the statute. But\nother than that the only thing that my friend has Mr.\nAndre has cited are these summaries in various\ncongressional reports which essentially summarize in\nshorthand, often in a single sentence, all of the\nproposed exceptions in the FTCA; and none of those\nsummaries so much as refers to the \"and any other law\nenforcement officer\" language at all. In fact, some of\nthe summaries on which Petitioner relies do not even\ncite the detention of property exception at all.\nSo this is, in our view, a case in which at\nmost, the legislative history is simply silent. And we\nare left, I think, and indeed we should start with the\ntext of the statute, and we have the unambiguous phrase\n\"or any other law enforcement officer\" in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have a difference\nwith Mr. Andre on the extent to which other law\nenforcement officers assist customs and revenue agents.\nIn your brief you say that's a rare occurrence. And\nMr. Andre says oh no, it's quite common. So which is\nit?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we do believe that it\nis a rare occurrence, but in some sense, Justice\nGinsburg, I think that the answer to that question\ndepends on exactly what it is that Petitioner means when\nhe says that an officer is acting in a customs or tax\ncapacity. And with the Court's leave, I'd like to offer\nat least three possible explanations for what that means\nand then explain why each of them would be an erroneous\ninterpretation for this Court to adopt, and each of\nthese three explanations I should add, appear at various\npoints in Petitioner's brief.\nThe first is that an officer is acting in a\ncustoms or tax capacity when the officer is actually\nacting in a revenue collecting capacity. And we believe\nthat if the Court were to adopt that limitation, there\nreally are no actual cases of which we are aware that\nwould fall within that language. And indeed, it would\ncast some doubt on the meaning of the preceding phrase\n\"any officer of customs or excise\" because one might\nvery well wonder whether under Petitioner's construction\nthat phrase should also be limited to a revenue\ncollecting capacity.\nThe second possible explanation is that an\nofficer is acting in a customs or tax capacity when the\nofficer is more generally acting to enforce the customs\nor tax laws, that is to say, the provisions of Title 19\nor 26 of the United States Code. But we believe that\nthat interpretation, too, would suffer from the same two\ndeficiencies that I've already identified and would also\nsuffer from a third, namely, to the extent that\nPetitioner relies for his noscitur a sociis argument on\nthe assessment of taxes clause, that limitation would\nactually sweep more broadly than the mere assessment of\ntaxes.\nSo the third possible interpretation and the\none that we're left with, I think, is that an officer is\nacting in a customs or tax capacity whenever the officer\nis actually performing a function that is performed by\ncustoms or excise Internal Revenue officers. But if\nanything, that limitation would exclude only a very\nsmall number of cases apart from cases in the prison\ncontext such as this one, because as Petitioner himself\nrecognizes, customs officers have virtually plenary\nauthority to enforce the criminal provisions of the\nUnited States Code.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are all customs and excise\nofficers law enforcement officers?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: All customs officers, by\nstatute, have law- enforcement authority, and that is\nunder, I believe, 19 U.S.C. 1589(a).\nNow, to be sure, there are people employed\nby the Customs Service, now ICE and CBP components of\nthe Department of Homeland Security, who wouldn't\nqualify as customs officers.\nThere are secretaries and other people\nemployed there that don't that statutory definition.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are there other\ncircumstances in which, let's say, goods are being\nshipped into the country, and the -- the shipment is\ndetained by someone who is not a law-enforcement\nofficer, at least under the definition in subsection\n(h), someone who has the power to execute searches,\nseize evidence, and make arrests?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think they typically would\nbe, and I'm not aware of any examples in which they\nwould not be, because customs officers are the vast\nmajority of people who are employed by the various\ncustoms-related agencies.\nAnd the same is true, I would note, with\nregard to Internal Revenue officers. One of the\noddities of this statute is that Judge Holtzoff, rather\nthan using the known term \"Internal Revenue Officer,\"\nactually used this phrase \"officer of excise,\" seemingly\nborrowing from the British bill.\nAnd we believe that, at most, that phrase\nwould have to refer to an Internal Revenue officer\nacting in an excise- collecting capacity. But, to the\nextent that \"excise officer\" has a narrower meaning than\n\"Internal Revenue officer,\" we believe that that\nactually supports our construction, because it would\nhave been quite peculiar for Judge Holtzoff and Congress\nto have referred only to an excise officer and not to an\nInternal Revenue officer if they had meant to limit the\nresidual phrase \"any other law-enforcement officer\" to\nofficers acting in a customs or tax capacity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you -- have you found\nany -- any research on that? I mean I think that's a\nvery interesting point that -- that -- have you found\nany book I could look at or report that -- that would\ncast some light on whether at that time, 1946, the\nphrase \"other law enforcement officers\" referred to a\nlarge number of people who had a lot of different tasks\nthat had not much to do with customs or excise?\nIf so, this would be an odd way of sneaking\nthem into the bill. That's who it would look like.\nOn the other hand, if there were just a few\nof them, well, then, the bill, at worst, is a little bit\nmore than somebody might have thought; and it would\nappear perfectly normal to a legislator. So is -- is\nthere anything to look at?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I wish that I could point to\nsuch a book, Justice Breyer. I know that, in doing my\nown research, what I did was simply to go on the\nInternet and go to the website's of various Federal\nlaw-enforcement agencies and try to get a sense of when\nthey were established.\nBut, unfortunately, as I said earlier, I was\njust unable to obtain any numbers as to how much\nofficers these various agencies had, and the like.\nBut I think that, more broadly, certainly\nCongress knew what the phrase \"any other law enforcement\nofficer\" meant. And Judge Holtzoff proposed this\nlanguage in what would become the bill that was\nintroduced in December of 1931.\nThe FTCA was, of course, ultimately enacted\nin 1946, and I think that one of the difficulties in\nattempting to look to this legislative history, which,\nas I say, we believe is silent, is that you're talking\nabout, you know, a number of Congresses over many years.\nAnd, to be sure, this Court has looked to\nthese same legislative history sources in prior\ndecisions construing the FTCA. But, you know, I do\nthink that we are left with the plain language here.\nAnd we are also left with Congress's underlying policy\nobjectives, and I do want to say a word about the other\ntwo policy objectives on which this court relied in\nKosak which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, before you\nget into policy, may I just suggest that there is a\npossible fourth category, really. You had mentioned\nthree, and one -- a fourth possibility might be\n\"law-enforcement officer,\" in a very broad sense of the\nterm, but one who is simply providing, let's say,\nprotective service in aid ultimately of the revenue\nlaws.\nAnd the reason I have thought of this is\nthat this sort of situation went on in my -- my native\nState in this past month, in which the United States\nMarshal Service, which at the time all of these statutes\nwere enacted was a fairly large agency, took control of\nsome real estate in -- in New Hampshire which had been\nthe property, or was the property, of tax protesters.\nAnd they -- they held custody of that. They\ntook control of that real estate for about a week to\nmake sure that there were no booby traps and bombs that\n-- that would -- that would blow up the IRS people when\nthey went in there to enforce their tax liens.\nThat would be an example of \"law-enforcement\nofficer\" in a very broad sense. It could cover the\nMarshal service, the FBI, and whatnot; and, yet, the --\nand No. 2, they would be exercising, you know, typical\nlaw-enforcement functions, protective functions. And,\nyet, they would be doing so in -- in aid of -- of the\ntax or the revenue laws.\nThat would be a plausible reason for -- for\nsticking in the general phrase, and it would be a\nplausible reading of the phrase, wouldn't it?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Justice Souter, I\nthink, with no disrespect to the good law-enforcement\nofficers of New Hampshire, that these cases come up far\nmore rarely in the Federal context, because both customs\nofficers and Internal Revenue officers are\nlaw-enforcement officers who have, I think, quite a\nrefined capability. They carry weapons, and they are, I\nthink, usually very well prepared to kill if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do IRS agents have -- have\nexpertise in -- bomb detection and dismantling?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: There certainly might very\nwell be cases in which they would feel the need to call\nin the FBI or other law- enforcement agencies. But I do\nthink that it is telling that in the 60-year history of\nthe FTCA there don't appear to be any cases that fall\ninto that category.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there don't seem to\nbe many cases because -- I mean that's why we've got\nthis one at this point.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there are quite a few\ncases more generally. I think that there are something\nin the neighborhood of 17 prior decisions in the courts\nof appeals alone involving these fact patterns or\nsimilar ones.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Over what period of time?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Over the 60-year period of\nthe enactment of the FTCA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean that's not --\nthat's not a deluge of litigation. I mean it seems to\nme there is reason to assume that no matter what reading\nwe give it, there is a plausible reading that can come\nup that -- that confines the actual application of the\n\"other law-enforcement officer\" fairly narrowly.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: But our fundamental\nsubmission, Justice Souter, is that there is no good\ntextual reason for confining the phrase \"any other\nlaw-enforcement officer,\" because that phrase, in our\nview, is unambiguous.\nAnd, notably, Petitioner in his brief and at\noral argument does not directly contend that there is\nany ambiguity in that phrase, itself. And this Court\nhas noted, in applying both the noscitur a sociis and\nthe ejusdem generis canons of construction, that where\nthe relevant phrase to which a limiting construction is\nbeing applied is itself unambiguous, that that is the\nend of the inquiry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the question of\nwhat is -- what is ambiguous or not is -- is a question\nof context. And if you take the phrase \"law-enforcement\nofficer,\" and you say is that ambiguous, and you say\nwell, gee, no.\nBut if you stick it in this particular\nstatute and it happens to follow these specific\nreferences to tax gatherers and tax and excise laws,\nthen it seems to me it's fair to say it does become\nambiguous, because it gives rise to a reasonable\nquestion.\nWere they just getting at law-enforcement\nofficers who were performing these kinds of functions,\nor did they really mean it as broadly as the phrase in\nreal isolation would have meant? That's ambiguity, and\nthat's what we've got here.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I don't believe that that's\ncorrect, Justice Souter, and the reason that I don't\nbelieve that that is correct is because this Court has\nsuggested that the starting point is the relevant phrase\nthat is being interpreted.\nAnd here we have the phrase \"any other law\nenforcement- officer.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But then you are saying,\ndon't read the statute as a whole. That argument, in\neffect, is saying isolate the phrase -- and we don't do\nthat.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, Justice Souter. I\nthink that where the phrase is unambiguous, this Court\nhas suggested that the inquiry is at an end, and, to\ntake an example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I agree with you. And if I\nmake the assumption that it's unambiguous, your argument\nis unassailable. But if I don't make that assumption,\nthen your argument risks circularity.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, let me --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And my suggestion is that\nit is the context that makes your argument a tough sell.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Let me try to explain to you\nwhy you should make that assumption, and it is because\nCongress here used the word \"any.\"\nAnd this Court has repeatedly noted that\nwhere Congress uses the word \"any,\" it is substantial\nevidence that Congress intends a phrase to be construed\nbroadly. And this Court has specifically refused to\napply the ejusdem generis canon to phrases introduced by\nthe word \"any\" on precisely the ground I cite, namely,\nbecause they conclude that that phrase is unambiguous.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you are talking about\nthe use of the word \"any\" all by itself. Here it says\n\"any officer or customs or excise or other\" -- \"or\nother,\" and you would just take those words out of the\nstatute.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we wouldn't be taking\nthe words out of the statute, because we do believe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you believe they add\nnothing to the text of the statute.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: They add nothing to the text\nof the statute in the sense that Congress could have\nwritten the statute to refer to any law-enforcement\nofficer. That is certainly true. That is also true\nwith regard to all of the statutes and constitutional\nprovisions that we cite in footnote 11 of our brief.\nAnd, indeed, in some sense, it would be true with regard\nto Petitioner's proposed construction insofar as\nCongress could easily have written a statute that simply\nreferred to any law-enforcement officer acting in a\ncustoms or tax capacity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are two \"anys\" here.\nI'm not sure that --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I'm certainly referring to\nthe \"any\" that modifies \"any other law enforcement\nofficer.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any other. So it says any\ngoods by any officer of customs or excise, or if it just\nhad said \"other law enforcement officer,\" you might --\nyou might disregard the force of any because it was way\nback there.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's right. And contrary\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if they repeat \"or any\nother law enforcement\" --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's right. And contrary\nto Mr. Andre's submission, this Court has made precisely\nthat point in Harrison v. PPG Industries, in which the\nCourt was construing a similar phrase that referred to\n\"any other final action by an EPA administrator.\" And\nthat came after a series of specific final actions to\nwhich the statute referred. And the Court actually\nsaid, in so many words, it might be different if the\nword \"any\" were omitted, but we believe that the\ninclusion of \"any\" renders that phrase unambiguous.\nAnd I would note as well, Justice Souter,\nthat in your dissenting opinion to be sure in Circuit\nCity in footnote 2, you cited all of these very cases on\nwhich I'm relying now in support of your proffered\nconstruction of the statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They were on point for my\ndissent. I know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think -- I would\nrespectfully submit that they are on point to our\nconstruction as well. But I do want to say a word about\nthe underlying policy objectives here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know your time is\nrunning out, but I would like you also to say a word\nabout what remedy, if any, does Ali have when you're\nsaying he had his prayer rug and Koran, and the\ngovernment lost them and he didn't get any compensation?\nDoes he have any remedy?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Sure, Justice Ginsburg. And\nthe answer is, yes, that he does. He does have an\nadministrative remedy.\nAnd I'd like to say just a couple of things\nabout the available administrative remedies.\nFirst of all, any claimant who claims that a\nFederal agency, including a Federal law enforcement\nagency negligently damaged his or her property, would\nhave a claim under 31 U.S.C. 3723 for up to $1,000.\nThat statute, which we cite in a footnote, I believe in\nour brief, would cover the vast majority of claims\ninvolving the Bureau of Prisons.\nThere's actually another Federal statute, 31\nU.S.C. 3724, which provides a further remedy against the\nDepartment of Justice for up to $50,000 for personal\ninjury or property damage caused by a law enforcement\nofficer. And critically, that statute expressly makes\nclear that it applies where the FTCA does not. And so\nthat administrative remedy would be fully available.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no court --\nthere's no court role in that process.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: There is no court role in\nthat process, but the Bureau of Prisons routinely\nprocesses these administrative claims. As we note in\nour brief, there were 12,000 such claims over the last\nthree years. The Bureau of Prisons has procedures for\nprocessing those claims. It paid out something in the\nneighborhood of 1,100 of those claims.\nAnd there's no reason to think that the\nBureau of Prisons would alter those procedures if the\nCourt were to hold in this case that there is no\njudicial remedy. Indeed, the Bureau of Prisons has paid\nout on such claims even in circuits that have adopted\nour interpretation.\nI do want to say just a word about the\nunderlying policy considerations, because to the extent\nthat members of the Court feel that the statute is\nambiguous, we believe that they strongly support our\nconstruction.\nIn Kosak, this Court analyzed two other\npolicy considerations in addition to the avoidance of\nduplicative remedies: First, protecting important\ngovernment functions from the threat of suit; and\nsecond, avoiding exposure to fraudulent claims. And we\nbelieve that those concerns are particularly implicated\nin the prison context which constitutes the mine run of\ncases in this area. Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Shanmugam.\nMr. Andre, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. ANDRE: I'd like to first address the\ngovernment's resistance to making any concession that\nthe statute is ambiguous. First of all, if the\nstatutory language in this case was so clear, then so\nmust the statutory language in Circuit City. The\nlanguage had started out with the words \"any other,\" and\nclearly then were followed by words that have a very\nplain meaning out of context, \"any worker engaged in\ninterstate or foreign commerce.\"\nWe just don't believe that the government's\nposition that the statute is unambiguous can be squared\nwith that case. Nor do we think as a factual matter\nthat the statute is unambiguous.\nIn particular, we think it would have been\nstrange for this Court in Kosak to go out of its way in\na footnote and expressly decline to resolve today's\nquestion presented if the detention of property clause,\nin particular the \"law enforcement officer\" phrase, had\nonly one clear meaning.\nAnd then on top of that, as we noted in our\nreply brief, five courts of appeals have adopted our\nconstruction; two other circuit judges have written\nseparately. The total is 16 circuit judges that have\nfound our position to be credible, found the statute to\nbe ambiguous, applied the canons of construction that we\nare urging the Court to apply today, and then resolved\nthe case in our favor\nSo if, if the statute is truly unambiguous,\nthen those 16 circuit judges not only got this issue\nwrong, they got it very wrong.\nJustice Breyer, I unfortunately don't have an\nexample either of what other types of law enforcement\nofficers were out there at the time of the FTCA's\nenactment, but I do have one example, and that would be\nthe Elliott Ness and the Al Capone investigation.\nElliott Ness was in charge of running a group\nof -- in charge of supervising a group of government\nagents who were part of the Department of Justice, even\nthough Elliott Ness himself was a treasury agent. And\nthey were all trying enforce the Volstead Act, but -- to\nget Al Capone on charges of income tax evasion. And so\nwe believe that that's a nice example from the early\n1930s when Judge Holtzoff drafted this language that\nshows that you could have a revenue officer working\nwith -- in fact, supervising other law enforcement\nofficers, and they are all really doing the same thing.\nAs far as the policy considerations are\nconcerned, we believe that the government's reliance on\nthe two other general purposes for the FTCA exceptions\njust prove too much. Pretty much any governmental\nfunction is important. And so the government in every\nbrief they filed on this issue below and in pretty much\nevery FTCA exception case that we've seen has come in\nand said, oh, but our interests are served by these two\nother purposes, and therefore, this statutory exemption\nhas to be construed narrowly.\nAgain, as a factual matter, we don't think that\ntheir concerns are really all that well founded, in any\nevent. True, there were 12,000 administrative claims filed\nby Federal prisoners over the last three years. But as we\npointed out in footnote 12 of our cert petition, there\nwere only 16 cases filed in all of 2006 by Federal\nprisoners under this statute.\nsettlement process is working, and that also Federal\nprisoners are just not bringing suit and there is a very\ngood reason for. That it's the Federal filing fee.\nThat's $455. My client's claim in this case is $177.\nPrisoners don't evaluate whether to sue based\non some sophisticated reading of sovereign immunity\ndoctrines and ambiguous statutory text. They, you know,\nthey think about their wallet. They make $2.50 a day,\nand it's just not worth it for them to risk --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't they have IFP\nstatus?\nMR. ANDRE: Even if a prisoner gets IFP\nstatus, they still have to pay the full filing fee. The\nIFP status only allows them to pay in installments. So\nit's debited off their account. So they still make a\nvery real calculation when they decide whether to sue\nbased on how much is at stake and how much is it going\nto cost me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here there wasn't that\nmuch at stake.\nMR. ANDRE: That's correct. There was $177\nat stake and so perhaps my client shouldn't have sued\nbecause it didn't make a lot of sense, although he also\ndid file the suit a couple years earlier when the filing\nfee was lower. But in our experience, prisoners they\nare not going to typically sue for these kinds of\nclaims. This is nothing like the Prison Litigation\nReform Act problem we had in Jones V. Bock, where there\nare 24,000 cases coming before the Federal courts every\nyear. That's just not something we envisioned.\nSo we don't think that adopting any one of\nthe four constructions discussed are debated between my\nfriend and Justice Souter would somehow open up the\nfloodgates here and lead to a lot of prisoners suing\nunder this particular provision. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
