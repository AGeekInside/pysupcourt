POSNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. POSNER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nFor two reasons, the Sixth Circuit was wrong\nto hold that a company that is an ERISA claim fiduciary\nand that separately funds the plan's liabilities must\nalways be deemed to be operating under a conflict of\ninterest that changes the employer's designated\narbitrary and capricious standard of review under its\nplan document. And the first reason is one that we're\non common ground with and that is, as this Court\nrecognized in Pegram v. Herdrich, ERISA explicitly\nauthorizes companies like MetLife to fulfill both\nfiduciary and nonfiduciary functions as long as it does\nnot in actuality commingle those functions. The mere\nfact that the potentiality of conflict is inherent in\nall of these commonplace dual arrangements in ERISA\nwelfare benefit plans is not enough on its own to\ndisplace the employer's designated abuse of discretion\nstandard of review.\nAnd secondly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but neither, neither\ndoes the fact that there may be dual capacities\neliminate the fact that there are contrary tugs on the,\nthe individual or the, or the organization that has the\ndual responsibilities, and there's no reason that the\nlaw should be blind to that.\nMS. POSNER: No, Your Honor, it should not\nbe blind. And as Firestone recognized, though, if in\nfact there is a, an entity that is in actuality\nconflicted, a claim administrator, then that conflict\ndoesn't change the standard of review.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by --\nlet's get straight by what we mean by \"in actuality\nconflicted.\" Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial\ninterest in actuality conflicted?\nMS. POSNER: We're using the words --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And aren't we talking in\nthis case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality\nconflicted.\nMS. POSNER: No, Your Honor. We are using\nthese terms to designate in actuality a conflicted\nfiduciary is one that has been infected or the decision\nwas infected by the conflict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's, that's a\nconflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its\njudgment. But the conflict exists whether you, whether\nyou give it effect or not.\nMS. POSNER: Yes, that's right, Your Honor.\nThere is a conflict that we're saying is a potential\nconflict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So let's call that a\nconflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties,\nwhether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his\njudgment.\nMS. POSNER: Yes. And as this Court\nrecognized in Firestone, Your Honor, when there is an\nactual conflict, that's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me follow up on\nJustice Scalia's question because I think your brief\nreally goes astray on that. Think of the many\nsituations like the remainderman who is the trustee. He\nhas to look out for the interests of the live tenant,\nbut he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants\nto be economical. That's not saying that he is. So\nI've always understood that the term \"conflicting\ninterests\" means just that; you have conflicting\ninterests. It doesn't mean that you necessarily slide\nover into misconduct. And I think that if you would\nkeep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting\ninterest? Yes, there is. Has the trustee in fact\nslipped and taken unfair advantage because of the\nconflicting interests?\nMS. POSNER: That's exactly the distinction\nthat we are making by using actual and potential or, as\nthis Court said, possible and actual in Firestone. And\nwhere that slip occurs in trust law or in ERISA and it\ninfects the decision, the Firestone court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does it have to be just\nthe specific decisions? Suppose that the company does\nnot have clear rules of, what do you call them,\nfirewalls between the profit side and the claims\nprocessing side. Would that be enough to cause a\ngreater, more searching standard of review, say de novo?\nMS. POSNER: I don't think it would ever\nresult in a de novo review. I think what it is is a\nfactor that should be weighed with all the other factors\nthat go to the actual benefits decision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then you're saying, A,\nthe fact that there is a potential conflict is not\nenough; B, the fact that there are no procedures in the\ncompany to ensure that the conflict doesn't affect the\njudgment, that is not enough either.\nMS. POSNER: No. I'm not saying that. I'm\nsaying that if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm positing. Does the\nfiduciary at least have the, the burden of production to\nshow that it has established clear lines of demarcation,\nfirewalls, whatever you call them, within the company?\nDoes it have at least that obligation going forward?\nMS. POSNER: No, Your Honor, it does not,\nand as the United States --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, I don't know\nwhat effect you're giving to the fact, as the earlier\nquestions have indicated, that there is a structural\nconflict.\nMS. POSNER: That's a structural conflict\nthat ERISA anticipates and, as the United States said in\nits brief to this court in Pegram v. Herdrich, that\nERISA tolerates this dual role and this level of\nconflict in order to keep these plans that are so vital\nin our country's economic interests in underlying the\nemployee's well-being --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write an\nopinion to say that it's irrelevant that a company does\nnot have procedures to insulate the profit section from\nthe claims processing section? I'll use those terms.\nMS. POSNER: No, Justice Kennedy, absolutely\nnot. But what we are saying is that if there were such\na fiduciary that factor must be weighed, but it doesn't\nchange the abuse of discretion standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does that work?\nI don't understand. You go through, you've got a\ndecision, whatever, it's a health insurance decision\nthat this procedure -- to determine that this procedure\nis not covered under the, the plan, that the fiduciary\nhas the discretion to make that determination. But you\nsay, aha, he's got a conflict of interest, so that's a\nfactor we take into account. Well, how does -- what\ndoes that mean?\nMS. POSNER: It means again, remembering\nthat these are claims under 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B) for\nbenefits due under the terms of the plan, it's very\nimportant that the courts remember to look at the terms\nof those plans --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, you've\ngot two cases, one where the person does not have a\nconflict of interest under a particular plan, the other\nwhere he does. It's the same decision: We're not going\nto cover this procedure. How is the review different in\neach of those cases as a practical matter?\nMS. POSNER: As, as in trust law -- and if\nyou look at the cases in trust law, what the court needs\nto look at when the settlor, here the employer,\ndesignates the discretionary authority under the terms\nof the trust or the plan is that that conflict comes\ninto play if it seems that it's been breached. But you\nalso have to remember exactly what the purpose of the\ntrust is, and so you need to protect the employer's\ninterest in having benefits paid in meritorious cases\nand not paid in nonmeritorious cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I don't see\nan answer to my question yet. How does the review\ndiffer as a functional matter? He says he looks at it\nand says, well, normally that would be within the\ndiscretion, but I've got to remember he's got a\nconflict, so I'm going to determine that this particular\nprocedure should be covered because of the conflict.\nMS. POSNER: It remains in the discretion\nbecause this Court said that that freedom of contract\nthat's so important to ERISA, to keep the benefits, the\nemployers interested in offering benefits --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying it\ndoesn't make any difference. You say you should take it\ninto account, but if it was a reasoned decision, which\nis the test whether or not he's a fiduciary, if it's a\nreasoned decision the fact that he's a fiduciary makes\nno difference, right? Isn't that what you're saying?\nMS. POSNER: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does make a decision\nthen. What was a reasoned decision for someone who\ndoesn't have a conflict becomes an unreasoned decision\nsimply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict?\nMS. POSNER: Certainly not. Again, it must\nbe a factor that's weighed with the other factors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly my question.\nMS. POSNER: Yes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm going to let you answer\nthis question --\nMS. POSNER: And I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I want you to work mine\nin if you can. The problem that I'm having is what to\nsay in the opinion. Now, could I say this? Firestone,\nyes, that's the way to put it as a standard. You can\nalso teach through example. So I look at this case, I\nsay: You want to know what that means, read the court\nof appeals opinion; it's perfect. Okay? So I've got\nFirestone -- my opinion so far is two words:\n\"Firestone, perfect.\" Okay? Now, what do you want me\nto say other than that?\nMS. POSNER: In this case -- and this case I\nthink presents a very narrow question for the Court, and\nthat is where there is the dual role inherent in the\nplan but no evidence whatsoever that it infected the\ndecision, if it must be given weight in answer to the\nCourt's second question, then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you come to the\nend of the line. You have to prove that the authority\nwas misused. And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision, what those judges were doing, they say we're\ngoing to look at this with some skepticism because of\nthe conflict. And let me give you a concrete example.\nThis woman got Social Security disability benefits and\nshe did it at the suggestion of MetLife is; that so?\nMS. POSNER: She actually applied herself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But she got a lawyer that\nthey recommended that she have.\nMS. POSNER: MetLife recommended a lawyer to\nher and also said she could use her own lawyer, which\nwas consistent with the plan design.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point is they\ncame to her and said: Get Social Security disability\nbenefits. Now, to get those she would have to show that\nshe is totally and permanently disabled.\nMS. POSNER: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So here is a company that\nsays: Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and\npermanently disabled, but -- and then we'll recoup all\nthat money that we paid out to you; but then when we get\na chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not\ndisabled. Why isn't it appropriate to regard just that\nset of circumstances with suspicion?\nMS. POSNER: Because, Your Honor, at the\ntime that that letter was written to the Respondent here\nin October of 2000, in fact MetLife had granted her\nbenefits. And the action of helping an employee perfect\ntheir entitlement to Social Security is in fact not a\nconflict at all. It's a fiduciary obligation under the\nterms of a plan and it helps the employee as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I'm not questioning\nthat at all.\nMS. POSNER: When --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds fine. It's a\nquestion of why, after helping her tell the government\nthat she was totally disabled, they, after the initial\ntwo-year period, turned around and said she's not.\nMS. POSNER: The -- the reason is -- and\nit's unfortunate that often Social Security makes the\nsame decision that the plan fiduciary has made two years\nearlier, and the government is looking backwards at\ncertain evidence that may not be before the ERISA plan\nfiduciary. The ERISA plan fiduciary at that two-year\npoint is looking at that evidence at that time and at a\nchange in the terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Posner, it seems to me\nthat that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether\nor not the person making the decision has a conflict. I\nmean that smells bad or doesn't smell bad, as you say,\neither way.\nMS. POSNER: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I am still -- listen, I\nknow that we're responsible for this because we said it\nin Firestone. We said that a conflict of interest\nshould be weighed as a factor. If that means anything,\nit seems to me it means that sometimes that weight will\nmake the difference. So at least sometimes -- but\nyou're not willing to admit that -- at least sometimes\nyou would say, oh, yes, this is a reasonable decision\nand had this decision been made by a fiduciary without a\nconflict, it would be perfectly okay because it's\nreasonable. That's the test. However, since this\nfiduciary has a conflict, what was a reasonable\ndecision, whoof, the added weight, it becomes an\nunreasonable decision.\nMS. POSNER: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what you mean by\ngiving it some weight?\nMS. POSNER: Yes, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You do.\nMS. POSNER: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So a perfectly reasonable\ndecision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a\nconflict?\nMS. POSNER: It depends on how close that\nreasonable decision is to the line, and in this case the\ndecision was not one that this mere dual-role conflict,\nthe lowest level of conflict that can exist, can push\nthat reasonable decision over. And I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, let's assume -- let's\nassume that I'm reviewing it, and I -- I don't find it\nas clear as you do, and I'm on the fence. Being on the\nfence, may I take into consideration the fact that there\nwas a conflict of interest?\nMS. POSNER: You -- I think under Firestone\nyou have to take that into account.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And therefore I will say,\nokay, I wouldn't know for sure how to go in this case,\nbut I see the conflict of interest and that's enough to\nmake me say more probably than not there was a\nreflection of the self-interest of the provider, rather\nthan the interest of the -- of the insured here; and,\ntherefore, I'm going to find that the -- that the\nconflict did disadvantage the person insured. That\nwould be, I take it on your view, a reasonable\napplication of Firestone.\nMS. POSNER: Again, depending upon how these\nthings weigh.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I just told you.\nMS. POSNER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I just told you how it\nweighed. I'm sitting on the fence. I'm not sure what\nto do. I take into consideration the fact that there is\nconflicting interest here; and, therefore, I conclude\nthat the conflicting interest is the reason for the\ndecision and I hold against the company. Is that a\nmisapplication of Firestone?\nMS. POSNER: No, it would not be. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's not the argument\nthat I understood you to make in your brief. Is that a\nchange from the position you took in your brief?\nMS. POSNER: No, Your Honor, I don't believe\nit is. The brief acknowledges that there are various\nconflicts that exist here. The conflict that ERISA\ntolerates and recognizes as being everyday, ordinary\npractice that is absolutely necessary for the employee\nbenefits of this country to remain vital, and that is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I just get this clear?\nI thought your position in your brief was that there has\nto be a demonstration that the conflict had an effect on\nthe decision before there is any departure from the\nstandard abuse of discretion --\nMS. POSNER: That's correct, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the standard of review.\nMS. POSNER: And I took Justice Souter's\nhypothetical to mean that there had been a conflict that\nseriously weighed on his view.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. My hypothetical is the\nhypothetical of the person making the decision. I put\nmyself in that person's position and I'm saying I can\nthink of reasons that might result in concluding that\nthis was a reasonable decision, period. And I can think\nof reasons that might result in concluding that, in\nfact, this was a decision that had been made against the\ninterest of the insured because the person making the\ndecision itself had an interest in it.\nI'm not sure which way to go, but I now take\ninto consideration the fact that there was this\nconflicting interest in the person or the organization\nthat made the decision, and for that reason, I am going\nto -- I'm going to break the tie, and I'm going to\nconclude that the conflict was to the disadvantage of\nthe insured. I'm going to rule against the company. I\nunderstood that you said that would be a proper\napplication of Firestone. Is that still your answer?\nMS. POSNER: I think that that could be.\nThe problem with all of these cases and when you look at\nthem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why wouldn't it be?\nMS. POSNER: Well, again, we're looking at\nconflict as if it's the only factor here, and when we\nlook at these cases --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. In my hypothetical,\nI've taken into --\nMS. POSNER: You're saying that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- factors that say the\ncompany was right, factors that say the company is\nwrong. I'm not sure which. They seem evenly balanced\nto me, until I take into consideration the fact that\nthere was conflicting interest, and I say that's enough\nto tip it. And it does tip it, and I rule against the\ncompany.\nMS. POSNER: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And am I right or wrong\nunder Firestone?\nMS. POSNER: Again, I think that it's very\nimportant to look at the employer's plan and this\nemployer specifically.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may be, but what's the\nanswer to my question?\nMS. POSNER: The answer is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am I right or wrong?\nMS. POSNER: The answer is you could be\nright or you could be wrong, but it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is not going to --\nMS. POSNER: -- so important --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's not going to help\nthe appellate court, my friends here who have to review\nmy decision. They want to know whether I was right or\nwrong.\nMS. POSNER: These matters are so\nfact-specific.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take these\nfacts.\nMS. POSNER: Okay, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As the trier -- I mean\nERISA, yes, it certainly says you can be both the plan\nadministrator and the payor, but all it says is that\nthat's permissible. But it also provides for review of\nthose decisions, judicial review in court. And here is,\nsay, a district court is looking at it and says: I\ndon't understand why the company didn't look at the\ndoctor's explanation and put such heavy weight on a\ncheckmark. And I also don't understand the suggestion\nthat she is totally disabled to the government and then\nsaying, well, she's really not, in this very close time\nframe. So it might be okay and it might not.\nI am in equipoise about this case, not the\nterms of the plan but the decision that was made to deny\nher benefits. So which way do I call it? That's the\nquestion that Justice Souter posed, and you seem not to\nwant to face up to it and answer it.\nMS. POSNER: Your Honor, the problem with\nthe hypothetical as you just stated is that you've taken\nthe employer's contract out of the calculation, and that\nthe employer has the right to determine its own plan and\ndesign those plans as they see fit in order to keep\nthese vital economic safety nets available, affordable\nand capable of providing a safety net to the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that bear on\nmaking a determination that the --\nMS. POSNER: Because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- employee -- that the\nplan administrator has to make: Is this person disabled\nand is she not?\nMS. POSNER: You can't make that\ndetermination, Justice Ginsburg, out of the context of\nthe plan design. This plan design says that Social\nSecurity can be -- can be an offset, estimated or -- or\nreceived.\nIt says that the plan administrator or the\nfiduciary not only has discretionary authority to\ndetermine eligibility for benefits and to construe the\nterms of the plan, but that its decision may not be\noverturned unless arbitrary and capricious.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, Justice\nSouter's question and Justice Alito's question highlight\nfor me what I think is the central issue. Justice\nSouter had asked you whether the conflict comes into\nplay, you know, when it's a tie. And you're right on\nthe fence, and you say, well, the conflict's a factor,\nso it tips over in the employee's favor.\nJustice Alito's question asked you whether\nor not the conflict has to play a role in the decision.\nI don't know how that would be, but let's say, for\nexample, the insurance company is doing well and so they\nsay, well, we allow coverage for this procedure. All of\na sudden, the insurance company looks like it's not\ndoing so well, it's not going to meet the quarterly\ntargets or whatever, so it says, well, we're no longer\ngoing to allow coverage for that procedure. In other\nwords, it is the conflict itself that affects which way\nit comes out.\nNow, which is right: Justice Souter's case\nin which the conflict tips the scales, no matter what\nthe reason is; or Justice Alito's case where the\nconflict plays a role in the decision process?\nMS. POSNER: We believe that it's the\nJustice Alito hypothetical, where it does play a role.\nWhere it doesn't play a role, it should have -- our\nfirst answer -- our answer to the first question is it\nshould have no weight. However, I understand that we've\nmoved beyond that to the second question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the problem with that is\nthe Court needs to know what the standard of review is\nbefore it gets to the merits. And how is the Court\ngoing to know whether conflicting interests played a\nrole in the outcome of a particular benefits\ndetermination without looking at the merits of the case\nunless there is going to be a lot of discovery about\ninternal processes at MetLife and how you treat the\npeople who -- who gets promoted among the benefits\nadministrators and all of that? And that's what I don't\nunderstand about that position.\nMS. POSNER: No -- yes, Justice Alito, and I\nthink you hit the nail on the head there. The merits of\nthe case must certainly be scrutinized, and they can be\nscrutinized for an abuse of discretion. And that's the\nimportant issue. It's scrutinizing the merits of the\ncase, whether or not the medical and vocational\ninformation supports the decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But as I understand\nyour brief, you say the conflict of interest is only\nrelevant if it affected the decision. But how does the\nplaintiff prove that it affected? What sort of evidence\nwould go to that issue?\nMS. POSNER: There are cases, Your Honor,\nwhere can you see that, for instance, when you look at\nthe medical evidence, that the administrator shows in\nits claim file, which, unlike any other area of the law,\nthe whole process is transparent under ERISA; and there\nmay really not be any evidence that's supporting it, or\nso little that it's hard to understand how that\nfiduciary could possibly have reached that decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're just saying\nthat the plaintiff has to have an overwhelming case. I\ndon't think you'd need the conflict-of-interest point in\nthat kind of case.\nMS. POSNER: That's actually the standard,\nthough, Justice Stevens, in trust law also. Because\nwhen you read these cases and you look at the examples\nin the Restatement, when the trustee has an acknowledged\nconflict and the settlor nevertheless vests in that\ntrustee discretionary authority, then in order for a\ncourt to displace that trustee's judgment the court must\nfind that the trustee actually acted from conflict and\nin controverse -- in contraverdia -- oh, my goodness --\nand did not follow the terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I can understand\nthat in normal trust situations, but it's hard for me to\nunderstand how you're going to prove an insurance\ncompany's particular claim adjustment was really\nmotivated by a conflict of interest rather than thinking\nthe claim wasn't valid.\nMS. POSNER: That is a problem, but the fact\nof the matter is that you -- you read the cases and the\nfiles, as I'm sure you have, and it's apparent that\nthere are -- let me use Post v. Hartford as an example,\nif I may. In Post v. Hartford there is a majority\nopinion that overruled the Hartford's discretion based\nmerely on minor irregularities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where, where is this\ndecision from that you're --\nMS. POSNER: Post v. Hartford, Your Honor,\nis at 501 Fed. 3d 154. It's the case that -- it's a\nThird Circuit case from 2007 that the Respondent very\nheavily relies upon, and it's a glaring example of\nwhat's gone wrong in the analysis here, because in Post\nv. Hartford there's a majority opinion that overruled\nthe Hartford's discretion based on minor irregularities,\nwhat it called as minor irregularities, merely because\nthey existed.\nThe dissenting judge looked at the medicals\nand, even under the Third Circuit's heightened scrutiny,\nwhich automatically it applies to insurance companies\nregardless of the situation, that justice said the\nmedical -- that judge, sorry -- said that the medical\nevidence very clearly supported the Hartford's decision.\nAnd what we are hoping will come out of\nthis, Your Honors, is that in fashioning what should\nhappen in these cases, that the fact that these are\nclaims for benefits under the terms of the plan must\nreally be important, not just minor irregularities and\nwhether this was done right or that was done right.\nThat's -- that's a cause of action under -- under\n1132(a)(2), and the Respondents are relying very heavily\non the replacement of the fiduciary, of the trustee.\nThat's not the issue here. That's an (a)(2)\nclaim under 1109 where you could replace the fiduciary.\nHere we are talking about were these benefits properly\ndenied or not?\nAnd if there are no further questions, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one feature of\nthis that I don't understand. It was referred to very\nswiftly in Judge Merritt's separate opinion. He said at\none point there was a proposal by MetLife that they give\nthis woman a trial run at a sedentary job to see if she\ncould do it. And he said that that made a lot of sense\nto him, and it was MetLife's proposal, but then it got\nwithdrawn. Could you clarify what that was?\nMS. POSNER: Yes. I believe, Justice\nGinsburg, that Judge Merritt was looking at a provision\nof the plan that -- actually, I'll tell you where it is.\nIt's at 170a of the joint appendix. And that provision\nallows rehabilitative employment for a disabled person.\nIn early 2002, MetLife did refer the file to a\nvocational rehabilitation specialist to determine\nwhether or not the Respondent was eligible for that.\nIn doing that, a letter was sent to the\ntreating physician, Dr. Patel, asking specifically what\nshe could do in an eight-hour day; could she do\nfull-time sedentary work; and if there were any physical\nbarriers. And that's that March 12th, 2002, letter --\nit was not a form -- which he filled out and said in an\neight-hour day she could sit for eight hours; she could\nstand for four hours; and she could walk for two hours;\nthat she could do full-time, sedentary work, and that\nthere were no physical barriers otherwise blocking her\nability to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did MetLife\nwithdraw that proposal?\nMS. POSNER: Well, there was no proposal,\nYour Honor, but it was given to a rehabilitation\nspecialist to work that up to see if she was disabled\nand eligible for rehabilitative employment, because her\ntreating physician responded to that inquiry by saying\nshe could do sedentary work, she retained that physical\ncapacity, which was consistent with what he said in\nJanuary of '02 and again in June of '02. That provision\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My question was not what\nDr. Patel said, but how did that proposal get dropped?\nMS. POSNER: There was no proposal, Your\nHonor. There is a provision in the plan -- it's at 170a\nof the joint appendix -- which allows for rehabilitative\nemployment for disabled people who may have the physical\ncapacity to do work they were not doing before.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. POSNER: Thank you very much, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rosenkranz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis Court got it right in Firestone when it\nsaid, of course a conflict must be weighed. There's no\nreason for this Court to overrode its well-reasoned and\nunanimous conclusion which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Dictum.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: It was dictum, Your Honor,\nbut it was very well-considered dictum because --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the only issue before\nthe Court so far as the parties thought was what is the\neffect of this dual role that Firestone had? And this\nCourt did not answer that question, but that's what the\nparties were arguing about.\nSo this Court correctly discerned the rule\nfrom trust law. It correctly discerned and balanced\nERISA's policies and, if anything --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't like about the\ndictum is I don't know what it means.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's lovely to say\nweigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket\nand it's fine. But what does it mean?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it mean that a\nperfectly reasonable decision that is within the\ndiscretion -- I mean this plan says that MetLife will\nhave -- knowing that it will have the conflict, that\nthey will make the decisions and so long as they are not\narbitrary, they are valid.\nNow, let's take a perfectly reasonable\ndecision. It is not arbitrary. Does giving weight to\nthe existence of the conflict which the settlor of the\nplan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean\nthat what was reasonable becomes unreasonable?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the answer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it doesn't mean that,\nthen it means nothing.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nThe answer is yes in many circumstances. And the beauty\nof the Court's invocation of trust law is that trust law\nanswers the question. Trust law says that when you have\na fiduciary with a conflict, you apply especially\ncareful scrutiny.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but trust law\ndoesn't take into account what we have said repeatedly\nin our ERISA decisions, which is we want to encourage\npeople to set up ERISA plans. And that has affected the\nstandards that we've adopted, for example, that we even\nallow a conflict of interest like this to exist.\nAnd it seems to me that your position is\ngoing to hurt beneficiaries under ERISA plans because\npeople are going to say, as they're perfectly free to\ndo -- people, the employers, are going to say, as they\nare perfectly free to do, you know, I'm just not going\nto do it; if we're going to have judges looking at these\nclaims decisions on a de novo basis, who knows how much\nit'll end up costing me, so I'm not going to set up\nthese plans.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I understand,\nand this Court considered that in Firestone, the\nlitigation cost and the added administrative costs, and\nthis Court concluded en route to de novo review that the\n1132(a)(1)(B) remedy is so infused with the interests of\nensuring that the beneficiaries get their benefits due,\nthat that is the interest that the courts weigh most in\ndetermining the standard of review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- which\nposition do you adopt? It was only posed as\nhypothetical, so I don't mean to attribute the position\nto you; but the Justice Souter hypothetical or the\nJustice Alito hypothetical?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the answer is\nboth. They can happen under both circumstances --\ncircumstances. But let me explain why. What trust law\ndoes is to say we apply especially careful scrutiny.\nAnd the scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose of\nthe scrutiny, which is to ensure that the conflicted\nfiduciary does not end up subconsciously or consciously\ntilting the scale.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that sounds\nlike the Justice Alito hypothetical. In other words,\nthe extra scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose.\nThe purpose is to protect against the conflict. So if\nthe scrutiny doesn't reveal that the conflict played a\nrole, then it's -- then it's not an abuse of discretion.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, because\nwhat trust law says is that you apply especially careful\nscrutiny, which entails two things. The first thing is\nwhat this Court called keeping the judicial eye peeled\nfor conflict of interest in Rush. So that's an\nexamination of the record of the decisionmaking process.\nYou kick the tires, you test the judgments, as the Sixth\nCircuit did in this case, and you ask yourself, is this\nthe work of an unbiased fiduciary?\nThe second thing is to imagine a zone of\nreasonableness within which a reasonably prudent trustee\nmight land and then say to yourself at the outer limits\nof the zone of reasonableness, we will accept the\njudgment of an unconflicted fiduciary because there is\nno reason for us to suspect that he reached that result\nbecause of the bias. For a conflicted fiduciary you can\ncontract that zone of reasonableness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Trust law doesn't say.\nTrust law does not establish a different standard of\njudicial review for the conflicted trustee.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it absolutely\ndoes, and the 26 law professors in the amicus brief that\nthey filed with this Court explain exactly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I don't know what to\nlook to in trust law. I mean, all that's happened here,\nevery life insurance -- every company, every life\ninsurance company has the kind of conflict that you're\ntalking about. Every company has the kind of conflict\nyou're talking about. And an automobile company might\nmake shoddy merchandise so it can make more money in the\nshort run.\nHow does trust law keep that kind of\nconflict? Now, it can't be and it isn't, because I've\nlooked it up, I think, that trust law says that every\ndistribution by a trustee whose own fee depends on the\nsize of the trust is conflicted.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I doubt, since banks are\ntrustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here -- -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that banks are\ntrustees -- suppose you were to say, look, the bank has\nan interest in maximizing the amount of money in its\naccount and therefore every decision of a distribution\nof such trustee is subject to some special thing.\nNow, the problem for me in this case is what\nin trust law do I analogize it to, not -- I don't doubt\nfor a second the 26 law professors, et cetera -- though\nI do really sometimes, but not in this case.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- so what do I\nlook to? And where I ended up was I'd like an answer to\nwhat I asked the other side. I ended up, I can't do\nbetter than Firestone, I ought to write two words in\nthis opinion, and the standard, perfect; from the\nopinion below, perfect. You want to know what I mean,\nread the opinion below. Okay?\nNow, what's your view on all of that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: So let me break it down and\nfirst turn to the premise. It is simply not correct\nthat every employer is conflicted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I overstated.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Take the examples that I\ngave. It's an ordinary insurance policy.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Okay. But the bank\nexample, Your Honor, that is not a pressure, which is\nkind of a business pressure, that trust law recognizes\nas a conflict of interest. Trust law acknowledges that\ntrustees are often, almost always, in the business of\nadministering trusts, and they don't -- they make their\nmoney by doing the job well. The big difference is we\nare talking here about a direct impact on the bottom\nline.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's, you see, their\npoint. Their point is this is just an ordinary\ninsurance company, an ordinary policy, and it's really\nlike a bank that's a trustee that in fact takes money\nthat hasn't been distributed and puts it on its own\naccount. They make money for that, from that. So there\nis a conflict.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have that kind of\nconflict.\nWhat do you say about that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Justice Breyer, it's just\nwrong under trust law and it's wrong under the facts, as\neveryone knows them to be in the insurance industry.\nThe insurance industry makes its money on the\ndifferential between the premiums that it charges and\nthe payouts in claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The bank makes its money by\nputting money in an account, paying interest and lending\nit at more money.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But -- So let me give an\nexample from real life. MetLife, for example, shells\nout $14 billion a year in ERISA covered claims. If it\ndenies one out of a hundred claims improperly, we are\ntalking about $140 million.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and Chase Manhattan\nbank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they\njust put in for three days money into an\ninterest-bearing account and lend it out for five\nminutes, they will make $1 billion. Okay. You see,\nthey are finding these kinds of conflicts everywhere.\nAnd that's what I'm asking you.\nWhat I think if I were to add something I'd\nsay, look at this carefully, judge, look at it\ncarefully; but if all you find is an ordinary insurance\ncompany doing ordinary work and there is no ground for\nsuspicion, proceed to step two. What about that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, the first\nthing to say is that -- if that is, in fact, an\nauthorized transaction, that would fall under the\nself-dealing rules of trust law, and trust law\nself-dealing rules are situations in which the set law\nhas actually suspended the duty of loyalty of the\ntrustee -- that's correct -- of the trustee.\nThat is absolutely impermissible under\nERISA. You cannot suspend the duty of loyalty under\nERISA. There is a clear provision about that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. -- Mr. Rosenkranz. I\nthink you set up basically three different kinds of\nscenarios. And I want to set -- I want to put them into\nmy own words and -- and have you tell me whether I\nunderstand your -- your point correctly.\nScenario number one is the case -- in each\nof these scenarios, we have the same relationship\nbetween the -- in effect, the trustee and -- and the\nbeneficiary that we have here. There -- there is a --\nthere is a built-in conflict. We don't know what its\neffect is.\nIn scenario number one, the -- the evidence\nis that the person making the benefits decision says\nlet's let this person suffer so that we can keep the\nmoney. That is the easy case.\nScenario number two --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor, says\nthat explicitly in the claim file?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right, the -- the\ne-mail shows up.\nIn -- in case number two, there -- there is\nwhat you referred to as a decision within the zone of\nreasonableness, but instead of being sort of in the core\nof the center of the zone of reasonableness, it's close\nto the edge. A decisionmaker could look at that\ndecision and say if there is no reason to be suspicious\nabout it, it's still within the zone of reasonableness,\nand I don't think there is a conflict.\nBut if the decisionmaker knows that there is\nthis kind of structural conflict, the decisionmaker can\nsay look, I wasn't born yesterday; the reason it's so\nclose to the edge is that they were giving way to their\nown self-interest in the conflict, and I'm going to\ndecide for the beneficiary and against the company.\nCase number three is the case of the person\nright on the fence, the decisionmaker. The\ndecisionmaker says, I've -- I've looked at everything\nthere is to look at and I cannot decide for sure what\nthis is, whether it was a legitimate decision or a\nconflicted one in the -- in the decisionmaker's favor,\nunless I take into consideration the fact that there is\nthis structural conflict.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the\ndecisionmaker here is the court reviewing? Or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No the decisionmaker is the\nperson who made the beneficiary -- the benefits\ndecision. And if I take into consideration the\nstructural conflict, that gives the decision to the\nbeneficiary and against the company.\nNow, in case number two, it's close but\nthe -- but the fact of the conflict is regarded as,\nitself, as substantive evidence and it -- it results in\na decision for the beneficiary.\nIn case number three, the evidence is in\nequipoise, and to get off equipoise, the conflict rule\nis taken as the tiebreaker.\nMy understanding is that your view is the\nproper way to consider the conflict under Firestone is,\nas I did in my hypo, in both case number two and case\nnumber three. Am I correct?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: To consider it, yes, Your\nHonor, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, when we\ntake -- it is taken as substantive evidence to -- to get\nus out of the zone of reasonableness in case number two.\nIt breaks the tie in case number three.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, absolutely\nnot. In case number two, if you are right at the edge\nof the zone of reasonableness and there is nothing else\nin the record to raise suspicions about the process by\nwhich the decisionmaker got there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the record has\nthe structural context.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, except for\nthat what would appear to be at a -- right at the outer\nbounds of reasonableness for an unconflicted fiduciary\ncould knock you over the fence, to use Your Honor's\nearlier analogy, for a conflicted fiduciary.\nDefinitely not for scenario two. If the\ndecisionmaker is correct in the judgment of the court,\n\"Gee, I don't know where to go, this is really close,\"\nwell, within the zone of reasonableness, in fact, in\nYour Honor's hypothetical, you're right at the -- the\ntarget center of the zone of reasonableness, then no, a\ncourt would absolutely not hold --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But in my hypothetical\nyou weren't at the center of the zone of reasonable; you\nwere close to the edge.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Number three. In number\nthree, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Number three Honor we can't\nmake up our mind.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But the decisionmaker, you\nsaid, Your Honor, in number three, could not make up its\nmind.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And if the -- and if the\ncourt confirms yes; the decisionmaker was right that\nthis was really close; you're right at the target center\nof the zone of reasonableness and the conflict of\ninterest doesn't push you over. The only thing that the\nconflict of interest could do there is the judicial eye\nbecomes peeled for other evidence of conflict which\nwould end up --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so you -- I guess you\nare saying it may be considered as substantive evidence\nbut it is not a process tiebreaker?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, let me rephrase\nit. What I'm saying is two things. The first is\nespecially careful scrutiny, just in the abstract,\nstepping back from the hypothetical, means that you\nfocus really carefully on the process by which the\ndecision was made, as the Sixth Circuit did in this\ncase. \"This is strange, they are completely ignoring\nthis evidence. They are cherry picking. They are doing\nabout-faces.\" That's one.\nSecondly, if you are at the target center of\nthe zone of reasonableness, and none of those procedural\nirregularities have arisen, to be sure that the district\ncourt reviewing would affirm that judgment --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How does a reviewing court\nknow how far it can go from the outer boundary of the\nzone of reasonableness when there is a conflicting\ninterest? Is it always -- and I don't know how thin you\ncan slice these standards of review. Is it always,\nlet's say 90 percent of the way to the outer boundary;\nor sometimes it would be 80 percent; sometimes it would\nbe 70 percent?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does it work like that\ndepending on the facts of the case?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that's\nwhere the Court can't calibrate. What the Court can do\nis provide very clear guidance to the lower courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what would -- how\nwould you verbalize it?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because everybody talks\nabout yes, it's a factor, it's a relevant factor. But\nif you are writing an opinion to give clear instructions\nto the district judges who are the first-instance\njudicial decisionmakers, what do you tell them?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I would say first and\nforemost -- I would say three things to the district\ncourts. Number one, this is not just some form of\narbitrary and capricious agency review with just a\nlittle bit more bite. This is reasonableness review\nunder trust law, which is very, very different.\nNumber two, the judicial eye is peeled, as\nthis Court said in Rush, for conflict of interest. Kick\nthe tires. Here are seven, eight, nine illustrations of\nthe sorts of things that lower courts should be on the\nlookout for as they are trying to discern whether the\nconflict tainted the result.\nNumber three, if -- if you are at the outer\nbounds of reasonableness for an unconflicted trustee,\nyou can contract that zone of reasonableness because you\ndon't -- when -- when an unconflicted trustee is right\nat the outer edge, there is no reason to suspect his\nmotive.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that the insurance\ncompany shows or may be required to show, at least by\nthe burden of production, that it has established\nfirewalls, very careful procedures, written regulations\nthat claims administrators are not to consult with the\npeople that set policy and prices. Does that suffice to\npermit, simply, abuse of discretion review?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. It would\nbe a factor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that there is nothing\nthe fiduciary can do in order to avoid intrusive --\nhighly -- a high degree of scrutiny in review of every\nclose case?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, first,\njust to be clear, we are talking about still a\ndeferential standard. It's just not as deferential as\nit would otherwise be.\nAbsolutely. An insurer can come in and say,\nlook, we've created all these procedures; they have\nmitigated the conflict, but it can never get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that all insurance\ncompany claims adjustors have less deferential review\nthan independent claims administrators?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, unless the\ninsurance company comes in and can demonstrate in a case\nthat we've never heard of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to institute\nan industrywide rule differentiating insurance companies\nfrom other --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, one very\nimportant thing to say about that is that under trust\nlaw, an authorized conflict.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there an example\nin trust law where, say, a bank's a trustee and they\nself-insure in some area? Is there ever a case in trust\nlaw that found that to be a conflict.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't understand the\nhypothetical, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, you can\neasily transpose this to other -- trusts are run by\nbanks often that are trustees. They're huge, and they\nmight self-insure in simple -- in certain circumstances,\nin which case you reproduce something like the conflict\nthat's at issue here. And so --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think that -- my\nguess, but I don't know. That's why I'm so nervous. Is\nthere any example where that kind of thing has ever been\nheld to be a conflict of interest?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Only where what the bank is\ndoing is engaging in self-dealing that -- of the sort\nthat's authorized. Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court should not turn a blind eye to the\nconflict of interest that exists when an administrator\nboth evaluates and pays claims. Instead, an\nadministrator's discretionary decisions should be\nreviewed for reasonableness where the conflict of\ninterest is considered as a factor. And what that means\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We've heard a lot of\ntalk about judicial eyes today, but it doesn't -- it\nmakes it sound as if abuse-of-discretion review is\nnothing, and with the added factor you want to look more\nclosely. Courts undertaking abuse-of-discretion review\ndon't do it blindly. They look at it. It's just a\nquestion of whether they give deference on the judgment\ncalls. And I'm still not -- I still don't understand\nhow the added factor or, in your case, the added seven\nfactors affects that issue of deference.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, we agree with the point\nyou're making, that the question in all of these cases\nis the reasonableness, where there's a discretionary\nclause, is the reasonableness of the administrator's\ndetermination. That is the ultimate inquiry, and there\nare any number of other facts and circumstances that\ncould suggest that the decision is unreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And --\nMS. SAHARSKY: And one fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that one of the\nthings that can make it unreasonable is the mere fact\nthat there exists this -- this conflict.\nMS. SAHARSKY: The conflict of interest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That renders what is a\nperfectly reasonable decision unreasonable. I --\nMS. SAHARSKY: In very close cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nIn very -- what kind of a standard is that, \"in very\nclose cases\"? How is -- how are you going to review a\ncourt? I mean, give it some weight in very close cases?\nIt slops over. This is not a standard. I don't know --\nI don't know what you're telling the courts to do.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, this is a standard that\ncomes from trust law, the reasonableness standard, and\nthis Court has recognized similar standards in all\ndifferent areas of the law where they've talked about --\nwhere you've talked about reasonableness and abuse of\ndiscretion review --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't mind\nreasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion.\nBut you're telling me that even when the reasonableness\nstandard is met, if there is this conflict, if it's\nclose -- how close is close? You -- suddenly it flops\nover the edge. I mean, you know, close to the out --\nit's -- it's beautiful art, but I don't understand how\nit turns into law.\nMS. SAHARSKY: In every case, the court\nwould need to make a decision about reasonableness, and\nin the cases where there is a conflict of interest that\nneeds to be weighed what the court would do is take a\nclose look at the administrator's rationale --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then what analogy? I agree\nwith your basic point. If I encapsulate it, you may or\nmay not agree with my encapsulation. This reminds me a\nlot of the argument between Learned Hand and Felix\nFrankfurter under what \"substantial evidence\" meant.\nAnd like Learned Hand, your side, I think, or the first\nargument, wants to find an absolute standard, a perfect\nanalogy, which Frankfurter said you can't do. Very\nwell.\nWhat's worrying me is what is the analogy?\nBecause you're not saying it's just conflict-of-interest\nlaw. You are analogizing it to a trustee who himself is\na remainderman. And it's at that point that I begin to\nget off this boat because I'm not sure that's the right\nanalogy.\nNow, you've looked through lots of cases.\nYour colleague knows it better than you, and he hasn't\ncome up with something that's a better analogy. But do\nyou see what's bothering me? So, therefore I'm back\nwhere I started: Two-sentence, two-word opinion. We\ndid our best in Firestone and this decision below is a\ngood illustration of how to do it. What can you add to\nwhat I just said?\nMS. SAHARSKY: First of all, this Court\nshould say that Firestone correctly set out the\nframework for the de novo default standard of review and\nwhat should happen in the case of a discretionary\ndetermination where the plan confers discretion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- that review should be\nunder the trust law standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we look at Firestone,\nit's rather laconic. It's just says -- it says,\nordinarily, if you don't have this discretionary\nauthority, it's de novo review. And then -- this is on\npage 115. It says if the fiduciary has discretionary\nauthority to determine eligibility benefits, then it's\nnot de novo. And what more does it say? I don't see\nthat it says anything more than that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, both on pages 111 and\non 115, this Court was looking to the law of trusts.\nThere's a more extensive discussion on page 111, where\nit says, for example, \"If the trustee is given power to\nconstrue disputed or doubtful terms, in such\ncircumstances the trustee's interpretation will not be\ndisturbed if reasonable.\" And then on page 115, using\nthat abuse of discretion reasonableness standard, the\nCourt said \"If there is a benefit plan that gives\ndiscretion to an administrator that is operating under a\nconflict, the conflict must be weighed as a factor.\"\nAnd Firestone told this Court to look to\ntrust law and trust law -- we think the best examples\nthere are the situations of a trustee who is also a\nbeneficiary or a trustee who is also a remainderman.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an insurance\ncompany -- I'll just repeat my earlier question -- has\ndone the best that it can do to have a firewall,\nindependence and so forth. Does that bear on whether or\nnot the less deferential standard of review is invoked?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The standard of review would\nbe the same, which is review for reasonableness, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it makes no difference\nwhat -- it makes no difference what the policies of the\ncompanies are insofar as the standard of review?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The standard of review is the\nsame, but the outcome could be different in that case\nbecause what the insurance company did should be taken\ninto account when the court is making a judgment call,\nthe same kind of judgment call that courts have made in\nequity cases for years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This --\nMS. SAHARSKY: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This bears upon the\nquestion Justice Breyer asked, which we never could get\ncompletely answered. Can you tell me what the Sixth\nCircuit did wrong here?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The Sixth Circuit correctly\ndetermined that there needed to be greater scrutiny to\n-- to the claims determination in this case. We would\nquarrel with the Sixth Circuit's analysis calling that\nabuse of -- or, I'm sorry, arbitrary and capricious\nreview because we don't think that that analogy to\nadministrative law makes sense. But what the Sixth\nCircuit did was correct in this. There were a number of\nfactors here, for example the Social Security\ndetermination, MetLife's participation in that, that has\nsuggested that this decision was unreasonable and could\nnot be upheld. Conflict of interest was a factor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you're at all\nsaying that it's the same standard of review. You keep\nsaying that, and your friend said it, but it's not the\nsame standard of review. You say it's still the\nreasonableness standard of review, but then you say,\nhowever, the mere fact of the existence of the conflict\ndoes at the edges make unreasonable what used to be\nreasonable. That is a different standard of review. It\nmeans you are not using a single reasonableness standard\nof review. You're arguing for a second standard of\nreview that is so vague I don't know what it means. Why\nnot just say that the district court, when there is a\nconflict of this sort, has to spend two more hours\nconsidering the case?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SAHARSKY: We think that the answer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's a clear rule, you\nknow.\nMS. SAHARSKY: We think that the answer\ncomes from trust law. We think that the answer comes\nfrom trust law, and these are judgment calls that courts\nneed to make --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under trust law\n--\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- about whether a decision\nwas reasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- we don't have --\nwe don't have an established policy of encouraging\npeople to establish trusts. We do have reflected in our\ndecisions an established policy of encouraging people to\nset up ERISA plans.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's true, but that's\nbalanced against the strict fiduciary duties in ERISA,\nthat in cases of a conflict of interest suggests that\nthe plan administrator's determination needs to get\nadditional scrutiny. I understand that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Here are two\nways you could do it. You've spoken of reasonableness\nanalysis. By \"reasonableness analysis,\" I mean and I\nassume you mean that the person who is judging the\naction taken says: Here are the good reasons on one\nside that support the action; and here are the reasons\non the other side that in fact are critical of it,\nsuggest that it was wrong. Which one of these sets of\nreasons is the strongest? That's what I sort of mean by\n\"reasonableness analysis.\" All right.\nThere are two ways that the structural\nconflict could be taken into consideration in\nreasonableness analysis. One is it could be taken into\nconsideration during this -- we'll call it the step one\nprocess. We put the structural conflict on the -- on\nthe side of the scale that weighs against affirming the\ndecision. A second way to do it would be to go through\nreasonableness analysis leaving the conflict aside for\nthe moment, and say, on regular reasonableness analysis,\ndo the reasons support the decision predominantly or do\nthey go against it, and let it go at that. But when\nthat kind of \"reasonableness\" analysis results in\nsomething close to equipoise, then we take the\nstructural conflict into consideration; and that's what,\nin effect, sort of breaks the tie.\nWhich of those models do we use? Do we use\nthe structural conflict as a reason in the step one\nweighing, or do we use the structural conflict as a\ntiebreaker.\nMS. SAHARSKY: The structural conflict\nshould be used in the weighing although, for the\npurposes of your hypothetical, I see the answer as being\nthe same in both situations that you posited. That the\nconflict of interest would only make a difference in\nclose cases, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's a question of when you\nuse it; and on the first hypothetical, you may not have\nto use it at all.\nOn the second hypothetical, you have to use\nit because you can't make a decision any other way. So\nyou're saying: Use it at step one as one of the\nsubstantive reasons in your weighing analysis?\nMS. SAHARSKY: That, we think, would be more\nconsistent with purposes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you're going to do\nthat, you have to tell me how much it weighs. You see,\nif you use it in step two when things are in equipoise,\nit doesn't matter how much it weighs. It's enough if it\nweighs a feather. In the equipoise case you come out\nthe other way.\nBut if you're going to use it in the first\nstructural system to determine, you know, how much each\nside -- I have to know its weight. And there is no\nindication whatever as to what its weight is. It's\nreally up to the district judge, I guess, to decide how\nmuch weight he is going to give to the fact that there\nis this conflict.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Can I answer the question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think the problem with this\ninquiry is that reasonableness does not have\nmathematical standards. It's a determination that the\ncourt needs to make weighing all of the facts and\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not weighing\nreasonableness. I'm weighing that factor of the\nconflict. That's what you ask us to weigh.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not reasonableness.\nMS. SAHARSKY: The conflict is one of many\nfactors like the Social Security Administration's\ndetermination and how it was treated in this case that\nsuggests that the plan administrator's determination was\nunreasonable. I can't tell you that it weighs 10\npercent or 20 percent in every case. It is something\nthat the Court has to take into account.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then you should only use it\nas a tiebreaker, I suggest, if you can tell me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Miss Posner, you\nhave one minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY K. POSNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. POSNER: Thank you Your Honor. On\nquestion one, I think it's important to know that the\nzone of reasonableness and the size of the field is set\nforth by the employer when it designates discretionary\nauthority and says that the standard of review is an\narbitrary and capricious one in court, which is the same\nin ERISA as an abuse-of-discretion standard.\nAnd the -- and the fact that's common and\nknown to the employer in setting forth that standard,\nthat there is this dual role, shouldn't change that\nanalysis at all, nor should it come into play in any\nsignificant way whatsoever in these decisions. But\non question two, if there is a conflict that influence,\nthat's not what the employer was anticipating. And so\nit -- it changes the size of the permissible field. And\nto get to Justice Scalia's point, the actual conflict\nthere does matter because it changes the size of the\nfield. It's not what the employer was intending in its\nplan. Now, if -- also on question two, if you view this\nas a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did you just say? I\ndon't understand that. The conflict was intended by the\nemployer. He appointed the --\nMS. POSNER: Yes. The dual-role conflict\nthat everybody knows exists --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was intended by the --\nMS. POSNER: -- was absolutely intended on.\nQuestion one, we are saying at that point it doesn't\nchange the size of the field; it doesn't change the zone\nof reasonableness; and, therefore, it should have no\neffect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
