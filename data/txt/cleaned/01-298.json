BEDERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a State affirmatively invokes the\njurisdiction of the Federal court by removing a case, that\nacts as a waiver of the State's forum immunity to Federal\njurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment. This principle\nhas been confirmed as recently as this Court's decision in\nthe College Savings Bank case where it was indicated that\na State may waive Eleventh Amendment immunity by invoking\nFederal court jurisdiction.\nThis rule also finds support in a long line of\ndecisions holding that where a State enters a Federal\nproceeding as an actor in any role, that effectively\nrelinquishes any objections to Federal jurisdiction a\nState may have under the Eleventh Amendment.\nQUESTION: When you say as an actor in any role,\ndoes it ever intervene as a defendant?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Justice Scalia. This\nCourt's precedents seem to indicate that wherever the\nState is cast in the role of plaintiff, defendant,\nintervenor, or claimant, that the entry into the Federal\nproceeding submits the State to the jurisdiction of the\nFederal court.\nQUESTION: How about the Ford Motor Company\ncase?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, of course, the\nauthorization requirement in Ford Motor -- and that's the\nparticular holding in Ford Motor that I think is of\nconcern to this Court -- need not be reached here because,\nof course, Ford Motor did not involve a case where a State\nwas actually invoking Federal court jurisdiction. So --\nQUESTION: So, you think a line can be drawn\nbetween the State defendant being drawn in as a respondent\nor involuntarily as opposed to removing and thereby\ninvoking Federal jurisdiction.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Chief Justice. I think the\nkey element here is precisely the invocation of Federal\ncourt jurisdiction. And again, this -- that's consistent\nwith this Court's rulings in -- in Gardner and in -- and\nin Gunter and Clark where it's made clear that where the\nState actually is invoking Federal court jurisdiction, the\nproper inquiry is not the authority of the State officer\nor attorney to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity. The\nproper inquiry is whether the State officer or attorney\nhad the power to engage in the litigation conduct leading\nto the invocation of Federal court jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: In all -- in all those cases, they\nwere cases in which a State really consented to have\nlitigated against it a Federal claim in a Federal court.\nAnd it's hardly surprising, once you agree to that, that\nyou also are agreeing to have related things litigated\nagainst you.\nBut this isn't that. This is a case where the\nonly reason that the State went into the Federal court was\nso that the individual defendants would be able to invoke\ntheir right to have the matter heard in a Federal court.\nSo, why isn't the obvious solution here -- there\nare only State claims left against the State which doesn't\nwant these heard in the Federal court. They haven't\nagreed to have anything heard there against them. So,\njudge, send it back to the State court. What's it doing\nhere? They don't want it here. Call that pendent\njurisdiction, pendent claims, but it's an abuse of\ndiscretion, at least, not to send it back.\nMR. BEDERMAN: If I may make a number of\nresponses to your question, Justice Breyer.\nFirst of all, I believe this Court's holdings\nparticularly in -- in Richardson, in Gunter do present a\nsituation where -- where a State is entering the\nproceeding and -- in the role of a defendant and later\ndecides to regret that -- that casting and tries to\nextricate itself from the proceeding. So, I think there\nis authority in this Court's precedents to that extent.\nTo your more general observation in terms of the\nharm here, in essence, weighing the plaintiff's interest\nin a single and unitary proceeding in State court, a\nresult which has been the -- this Court's jurisprudence\nconstruing 28 U.S.C. 1441(c) for almost a century that --\nthat the removal statute does not entitle defendants to\nremove and then split up claims --\nQUESTION: All right. Well, that's exactly --\nwhat if it's that? The interest of the plaintiff in\nhaving the action against the individuals in the State\ntried in one place, on the one hand, against the interest\nof the State having a State matter tried in State court\nwhere the State has refused to waive its immunity from\nFederal jurisdiction. That for me is easy. One is a\nconstitutional right; the other happens to be a right of a\nplaintiff that he wouldn't have anyway if he had brought\nhis suit in Federal court, which is what removal\njurisdiction is about. So, why doesn't the State clearly\nprevail on that one?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, Justice Breyer, again with\nrespect I think the -- the proper analysis I think closely\nanalyzing the State's professed interests in removing and\nclaiming immunity was, first of all, to engage the\nexpertise of Federal tribunals on questions arising under\nsection 1983 and qualified immunity.\nQUESTION: May I stop you there? Because you\nmentioned section 1983, and that makes this case terribly\npuzzling because I thought States were not persons. So,\nif you're not subject to suit under 1983 --\nMR. BEDERMAN: That -- that's --\nQUESTION: That's the basis of -- you're suing\nthe State and the State is not a person within 1983. So,\neven if you prevailed 100 percent on your Eleventh\nAmendment claim that you could remove despite that\nsovereign immunity claim --\nMR. BEDERMAN: Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would\nremind the Court that, of course, there was relief pled\nfor declaratory relief in the complaint, and under this\nCourt's jurisprudence following from Will, a declaratory\nrelief claim is properly pled in this kind of proceeding.\nOf course, Will says --\nQUESTION: Against the State? I thought a State\nwas not a person, period, under 1983. A municipality is,\na county is, but a State is not. It doesn't matter\nwhether it's declaratory, injunctive, whatever. They're\nnot subject to suit under 1983. Isn't that right?\nMR. BEDERMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg. Under I\nbelieve the footnote in -- in Will and also in the\nfollowing case, Arizona's Official English case, it made\nclear that that interpretation of section 1983 of a person\nfor purposes of suit was for money damages and that\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, in order to keep the\nsymmetry, presumably with Ex parte Young, as I believe\nthis Court indicated, was -- was a permissible pleading --\nQUESTION: Well, Ex parte Young is something\ndifferent. You're suing the officer, not the entity.\nMR. BEDERMAN: That's right, but recall that not\nonly are the regions being sued here but also individuals\nin their official capacity and as well as in -- in their\nindividual capacity.\nQUESTION: No. But Justice Ginsburg I think has\nsaid the individuals are out of it. Qualified immunity.\nWe're left with the State. She wrote for the Court in\nArizona Official English -- she says, the barrier was not,\nas the Ninth Circuit supposed, Eleventh Amendment immunity\nwhich the State could waive. The stopper was that 1983\ncreates no remedy against a State. Now, that's what the\nCourt held. So, 1983 creates no remedy against a State.\nSo, you have no Federal claim against the State, and your\nother Federal claims are disposed of.\nSo, we're left with a purely State matter in the\nState court -- in the Federal court, and the State says,\nremand this, send it back. Now, why shouldn't they?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, again, my response to that\nwould be plaintiffs do have an interest in seeing -- in\nfiling a single, unitary action in State court, as was\nproperly done here. And what the State of Georgia has\nattempted to accomplish via its removal and claiming\nimmunity tactic is -- is to break the -- break the\nplaintiff's claim into discrete parts and dispose of them.\nQUESTION: I don't understand that either.\nWhat's very puzzling here is you wanted the case to be in\nState court, and then it was removed. You moved to\nremand, didn't you?\nMR. BEDERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And now you're getting just what you\nwant. You're getting the remand and you don't want it.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, it's -- it's the remand\napparently with the -- the other consequences of the\nFederal court decisions to date. That's, of course,\nunfortunately one of the consequences of litigating\nEleventh Amendment immunity is that this was taken as an\ninterlocutory appeal, and other proceedings of course have\noccurred since then.\nQUESTION: But there's been no kind of\nadjudication on the merits against the State -- against\nthe State entity in any way, shape, or form.\nMR. BEDERMAN: No. You are correct, Justice\nGinsburg. To date, there have only been rulings by the\ndistrict court as affirmed by the court of appeals on the\nqualified immunity defense as against the -- the\nprivate --\nQUESTION: May I ask why it proceeded -- let me\nread you something else from one -- a fairly recent\nopinion. We have routinely addressed, before the question\nwhether the Eleventh Amendment forbids a particular\nstatutory cause of action to be asserted against States,\nthe question whether the statute itself permits the cause\nof action it creates to be asserted against States. Why\ndidn't the lower courts follow that procedure and -- and\ndecide the 1983 substantive issue of whether the State is\nliable first?\nMR. BEDERMAN: I -- I do not know, Justice\nScalia. In terms of -- in terms of what I understand is\nthe briefing and argument, the State of Georgia did raise\nthe Will defense in its papers. The district court chose\nto proceed with the case on another ground, dismissing the\nsection 1983 claims against the private parties in their\nindividual capacities on qualified immunity. Maybe there\nwas some concern about the status of the Board of Regents,\nbut -- but I'm as mystified, frankly, as you are about\nthat disposition.\nAgain, if I may repeat, the concern that\npetitioner ultimately has about the use of removal and\nclaims of immunity in this context is it splits claims\nwhich seems to be a result that's specifically prohibited\nby the removal statute and this Court --\nQUESTION: But that seems to be a purely\nacademic question not in this case because the qualified\nimmunity question, as I understand it, was decided against\nthe individual officers. So, what Federal question --\nthis goes back to what Justice Breyer asked. I don't see\nany Federal question left in this entire case.\nMR. BEDERMAN: If -- if you're not taking well\nmy point about the availability of declaratory relief --\nQUESTION: Well, at least the footnote that was\nread didn't make any distinction based on declaratory\njudgment. It said a State is not a person for 1983\npurposes. Period. That's what that footnote said.\nYou're telling me now that I was wrong.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I would never presume such,\nJustice Ginsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BEDERMAN: I -- I think maybe the safest\nresult -- of course, this has not been briefed -- is\nwhether this Court's judgment in Will and subsequently in\nArizonans for an Official English reaches this precise\nissue that I'm speaking to. No lower court has addressed\nProfessor Lapides' request for declaratory relief. No\nbriefing has been accomplished on that, and there's been\nno --\nQUESTION: But if you're not right about 1983,\nassume now that a State is not a person for purposes of\n1983.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Then what Federal element -- what\nFederal question is left in the case?\nMR. BEDERMAN: There would be none left.\nQUESTION: And then with all the Eleventh\nAmendment jurisprudence in the world, it would make sense\nfor any district judge to hang onto a case that at the\nthreshold had all the Federal elements taken out of it and\nhas nothing but State claims left.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Certainly after these\nproceedings, that might be the result that a district\ncourt judge in the exercise of -- of its discretion may\nwish to -- to achieve. Our concern is precisely the one\nthat when Georgia invoked the jurisdiction of the Federal\ncourts for removal, it should have been with the\nunderstanding that all claims would move to Federal court,\nthat the State could raise whatever defenses it wished to,\nin other words, the defenses travel to Federal court. But\nwhat is not a permissible result is, in essence, the --\nthe splitting of claims, the disposition to Federal court\nand then --\nQUESTION: I don't see how that -- how your\nclient is in any way harmed by any of this because he ends\nup with what he wanted is his suit in State court.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, if I may make a broader\npoint. The Eleventh Circuit's judgment, from which appeal\nis sought here, is not entirely clear about this\ndistinction between barred and non-barred claims. That\nwas not, of course, settled in any further proceedings in\nthe district court as to whether now the State claims\nwould proceed by remand back to State court.\nOf course, the State of Georgia sought the\ndismissal of the entirety of Professor Lapides' case under\nrule 12(b)(6) when it removed the case. So, it's -- it's\nnow -- not entirely clear at the outset what Georgia's\nintentions were in removing the case and then seeking\nimmunity.\nOur proposition is simply that, as a matter of\nnot only judicial efficiency but also the integrity of the\nremoval statute and the fair meaning and understanding of\nthis Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, is that\nwhen a State invokes Federal court jurisdiction under the\nEleventh Amendment, the entire case then moves to Federal\ncourt and that the State cannot, thereafter, claim\nimmunity from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in\nthose circumstances.\nIf the State does not have the authority -- and\nthis was an earlier question -- under Ford Motor Company\nto waive the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity via\nremoval, the proper course should have been in this case\nsimply for -- to find the removal was void ab initio and\nhave the entire matter remanded --\nQUESTION: But that's the end result you're\ngetting. You're getting a remand and you want to have a\ndifferent label put on it. But the bottom line is you\nwanted a suit in State court. That was removed. There --\nthere's no Federal element left. I can't imagine a\ndistrict judge who would hang onto such a case.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, again, I would not presume\nto anticipate the future proceedings and that may --\nQUESTION: Well, your legal position is\nbasically that a State should not be able to talk out of\nboth sides of its mouth I guess. It should not be able to\nremove and then when it gets to Federal court claim\nEleventh Amendment immunity. Now, how much of that\nargument is still valid after what's happened in this case\nI'm not sure.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, I think even though\npetitioner is, understandably, reluctant to introduce an\nidiom of judicial estoppel into these proceedings with --\nwith obviously the clear indication that rules of estoppel\ntend not to run against the sovereign, but again that is\nprecisely our concern.\nIn the matter of -- of the -- the symmetry and\nparity that occurs that when a State enters a Federal\nproceeding, it submits the entire case to the -- to the\njurisdiction of the Federal courts.\nQUESTION: May I ask you, Mr. Bederman? In the\nbrief in opposition to the certiorari petition, did anyone\npoint out the fact that maybe the State was not a person\nwithin the meaning of 1983 and that that was the reason\nnot to take the case?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, if I may review quickly.\nYes. And I do recall that the State did raise in its op\ncert at page 10 the argument under Will. I -- yes. They\ndo opine that Will would -- would act against the -- the\nclaims raised for monetary relief by petitioners here.\nQUESTION: They're only after monetary relief.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I would not want to put that\ngloss on -- on the States. I'm reading just an isolated\npassage on page 10 of their op cert. That -- that is, in\nessence, the -- the open question.\nIf I could return, Chief Justice Rehnquist, to\nyour -- to your observation. Again, while we don't think\nit's necessary for the Court to rule on any judicial\nestoppel principles, clearly this is an appropriate case\nto draw a bright line rule in terms of States invoking\nFederal court jurisdiction. Either they have the\nauthority to do so and waive Eleventh Amendment immunity\nand the entire case proceeds to Federal court or the State\nofficials or lawyers do not have that authority and the\nproper disposition is remand.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bederman.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor four reasons, a State's removal of a case to\nFederal court waives its forum immunity, permitting\nadjudication of the claims against the State in Federal --\nQUESTION: Explain to me whether we've ever\nbifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit -- from\nsuit? I just -- do we treat the two differently?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: They are both protections that\nare afforded by the Eleventh Amendment. Certainly a State\nhas both of those rights under the Eleventh Amendment.\nBut the question is the State can waive one\nwithout waiving the other, and that's what it did here, by\nselecting a forum, Federal forum, for the adjudication of\nthe claim. But in doing that, it did not give up the\ndefenses that it had in State court. And one of the\ndefenses that it had in State court, and it would also\nhave in Federal court, is a right not to be sued at all on\nconstitutional claims. But what it did give up is the\nright to proceed in State court, rather than Federal\ncourt, on the claims that it already has waived in State\ncourt.\nNow, the principle that justifies -- the -- the\nState's invocation of Federal court jurisdiction through\nremoval is a particularly clear example of a State\nvoluntarily invoking Federal court jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, may I deflect you?\nBecause I got from your brief the notion that this case is\nacademic, and let me read you from page 23, note 8. The\nquestion whether a State that removes a case waives its\nimmunity to constitutional claims is largely academic.\nSection 1983 does not authorize a suit against a State in\neither State or Federal court. It seems to me that you\nwere telling us in that footnote that whatever is said\nabout the removal, this case goes because the State is not\nsubject to 1983.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: To the extent that there are\nconstitutional claims against a State, that's correct. To\nthe extent that there are State law claims against the\nState, that is not correct because the State has waived\nits forum immunity with respect to the State law claims --\nQUESTION: Would a district judge be acting\nreasonably to hold onto a case that has no Federal claim\nthat involves the State tort claims act, that those are --\nthe State claims are under the State's own tort claims\nact, like the Federal Tort Claims Act. Can you -- could a\nFederal judge justify sitting to adjudicate a case against\na State under the State's tort claims act?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, that would be\na question for the exercise of the district court's\ndiscretion under the supplemental jurisdiction grounds.\nThat -- certainly if the Federal -- all the Federal claims\nwere out of the case, one ground for remanding the rest of\nthe cases under the supplemental jurisdiction statute\nwould be present. It would be a matter, though, for the\nexercise of the district court's discretion.\nQUESTION: It was always my understanding that\nthe district court would take into account how far have we\ngotten into the case --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- from the Federal --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Right.\nQUESTION: If you drop here, the Federal issue\ndrops out at the very threshold.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Correct, and that would argue\nmore strongly in favor of the district court exercising\nits discretion in that direction, assuming there's no\nother Federal claim in the case. And let me just address\nthat briefly because it is our understanding that a suit\nagainst a State official in his official capacity for\ninjunctive or declaratory relief is not a suit against the\nState and it is a suit against the person under -- under\nsection 1983. So, if there is a claim -- and I'm unsure\nof whether the complaint should be read that way, but if\nthere is a claim against the individual defendants in\ntheir official capacities for declaratory or injunctive\nrelief --\nQUESTION: I thought the -- the motion to\ndismiss as to the individuals was granted on the grounds\nof qualified immunity.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Only as to the claims against\nthem in their personal capacities, not as -- with respect\nto the claims against them in their official capacities.\nSo, that claim, if it's -- if it was there to start with,\nit's still there.\nQUESTION: I don't understand the difference\nbetween a claim against the State itself and the claim\nagainst the State officer in his or her official capacity.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The distinction that the court\ndrew was -- is this -- traces its origins to Ex parte\nYoung, that that is a suit against the officer in his\nofficial capacity. There's no allegation that he's done\nanything in violation of State law, and you're not trying\nto --\nQUESTION: What Mr. Lapides wants -- Mr.\nLapides, as I understand it, wants a money judgment.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I think it's -- it's largely\ntrue that he wants a money judgment, but there is one\nallegation in his complaint upon which he relies in saying\nthat he's also seeking declaratory relief against an\nindividual -- an individual officer in his official\ncapacity.\nQUESTION: So, that's like suing the State. In\n-- in other words, there is a claim. Under -- under 1983.\nA State is a person when you ask -- say I want an\ninjunction. The State is a person.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I would say -- I don't want to\nquibble too much with the semantics, but I would just -- I\nwould put it this way. The official is not the State for\npurposes of --\nQUESTION: All right. Then that's a different\nmatter. So, what you're saying is there is an action\nagainst the official. All right. That's not the issue\nbecause they dismissed all the claims against the\nofficials.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, they did not --\nQUESTION: Oh. So, there's still an action left\nagainst the officials. Fine.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If it was ever there, Justice\nBreyer --\nQUESTION: Fine. Okay, I got it.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- it's still there.\nQUESTION: Now, if that's so, how could it not\nbe an abuse of discretion? Assuming if that's even there,\nhow could it not be an abuse of discretion to refuse to\nsend this back to the State?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Again --\nQUESTION: A purely State matter.\nAnd -- and I'm not, you know, overwhelmingly far\nout I think in this area, but I don't really see why --\nwhy the State here wouldn't have a right to have it sent\nback on the ground it would --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- be an abuse of discretion not to.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- it wouldn't have a right\nto have the case sent back.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It would never -- because it's a\nmatter for the district court --\nQUESTION: There is an abuse of discretion under\ncertain circumstances.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And what I would say --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That would be the question\nwhether there is an abuse of discretion.\nQUESTION: And why not?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And the -- I don't want to argue\nthat part of the case too much, but the reason would be if\nthere are still Federal law claims against -- 1983 *games\nagainst the -- individuals and they arise out of a common\nnucleus of operative facts with the claims against the\nState, then it would still be fair to try those claims in\nFederal court because the State made a voluntary choice to\nbring this case into Federal court. It had an option to\nleave the entire suit in State court if it wanted to. It\nexercised the option to bring the case into Federal court.\nNow, once it did that, under Federal law, the\nFederal consequence of that is that a Federal court has\nauthority to adjudicate the very claims that the State has\nbrought there. And the principle that --\nQUESTION: Are you saying that it's a different\ncase because the State removed it than it would have been\nif the same factual circumstance had occurred in the case\noriginally brought in the district court?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I am, Mr. Chief Justice, because\nunder this Court's decision in Pennhurst, if a plaintiff\nfiles a suit in Federal court that includes both Federal\nlaw claims and State law claims, the State law claims\nagainst the State are -- have to be dismissed under\nPennhurst.\nBut the situation is different. This plaintiff\ndid just what the Pennhurst opinion suggested that he\nshould do, which is to file his claims against the State\nunder State law in State court. And -- and with that, he\nadded his Federal law claims so that he could have a\nsingle lawsuit filed in a single forum.\nNow, what the removal statute says is that\nthere's only can be removal if there -- you get the\nconsent of all the parties to the removal of the entire\ncase. The removal statute does not allow for State court\ndefendants to divide up a single case or controversy into\ntwo different cases in two different forums. And the\nState is effectively seeking to accomplish that goal.\nNow, it says it needs to do that because it\nwants to get the benefit of a Federal forum for its State\nemployees. But the -- just because the State has a\ndifficult choice to make about whether to remove a case to\nFederal court or not doesn't mean its decision to bring\nthe case to Federal court isn't voluntary. It's still a\nvoluntary decision to bring the case to Federal court.\nIt's also a little surprising to hear the State\nsay that it needs to have a Federal forum for its State\nofficials on Federal law issues when the State has\nrepeatedly and successfully argued to this Court that\nState courts are fully competent and just as competent as\nFederal courts to adjudicate Federal law issues.\nAnd it's -- it's particularly surprising that\nthe State thinks it's in the State's interest for its\nemployees to get an interlocutory appeal in Federal court\nwhen the State's own policy is that they aren't entitled\nto an interlocutory appeal.\nQUESTION: Well, the State is certainly entitled\nto make a tactical judgment --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It certainly is.\nQUESTION: -- that it's better off in Federal\ncourt than it is in State court.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It absolutely is, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and all we are saying is once it does that, then\nit has to accept the consequences of that choice, which is\nthe Federal court then has authority to adjudicate the\nentire case that has been brought before them -- before\nit.\nI wanted to say a word about the -- the Ford\nMotor Company case because in the Ford Motor Company case,\nthe Court did deem State law authority to consent to be\nthe critical issue. But all other decisions in which the\nCourt has addressed the invocation issue, the Court has\nheld that an individual when -- I mean, when a State\ninvokes Federal court jurisdiction, it waives immunity as\na matter of Federal law.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMs. Orland, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEVON ORLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. ORLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe State, along with its employees, removed\nthis case to Federal court so that its employees could\ntake advantage of a -- in a Federal forum.\nThis does not amount to a waiver for two\nreasons. First, it is not a clear and unequivocal\nexpression of the State's desire to waive its immunity,\nand second, the attorney --\nQUESTION: Is it a waiver of forum immunity as\nopposed to immunity from suit? Is there such a\ndistinction?\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, this Court has never\nmade such a distinction, and the first I've ever heard of\nthe concept of forum immunity being parceled out from the\nrest of the immunity was in this case. Apparently there\nwas a recognition at some point by the petitioner in this\ncase that the Federal claims would be barred even in State\ncourt, and then they've come up with this forum immunity\nconcept.\nQUESTION: It's not -- it's -- I mean, the\nconcept has been around. I mean, we've -- we've held that\na State does not -- just because a State is willing to be\nsued in its own courts does not automatically mean that it\ncan therefore be sued in Federal court. Isn't that right?\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, the concept of what --\nQUESTION: Which -- which means that -- that you\ncan be immune in one forum and not immune in another\nforum, although you're not immune from the suit entirely.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, that is exactly what\nthe Court found in Pennhurst, but I would suggest that the\nCourt has also found in Pennhurst that the absence of that\nchoice, that concrete choice, would emasculate the\nEleventh Amendment. So, what is being argued is by the\nexercise of procedural device for the benefit of our\nemployees would cause a State to sacrifice a part of the\nimmunity which the absence of would emasculate --\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- you know, that's too\nbad, isn't it?\nMS. ORLAND: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The cost of getting the advantage of\nFederal courts is that you -- you come into Federal court.\nIt seems to me self-evident.\nNow, you say I have a good reason for wanting to\nbe in Federal court. Well, you may indeed. But there you\nare.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, first of all, I'd like\nto point out that that cost is just too high. As the\nzealous advocate on behalf of all of my clients, I have to\nchoose between the individual's right to deal with the law\nas it is in the State of Georgia, whether that's the State\nof Georgia's choice or not, but the law in the State of\nGeorgia at the present time is that there is no right to\ndirect appeal. So, as a zealous advocate on behalf of the\nindividual employees, we have a desire to protect the\nindividual employees from the right --\nQUESTION: But that's a right of the State of\nGeorgia to protect the individual employees, and the State\nof Georgia has said the right to an interlocutory appeal\nis not all that important. You have the substantive\ndefense that you just can't because Georgia has its own\nchoice of whether it's better to have this decided after\nthe whole case or in the middle. They think it's better\nto wait till the case is over. Now, why can't Georgia\nmake that decision?\nMS. ORLAND: Georgia absolutely can make that\ndecision, Your Honor, through its legislative process, and\nthat's part of the point.\nQUESTION: Well, why shouldn't that decision\nalso influence the tactical decisions of the attorney\ngeneral when he's litigating?\nMS. ORLAND: Because the attorney general\nrepresents more than just the State in a lawsuit such as\nthis. The individuals are also being represented by the\nattorney general, and the State should not be required to\nsacrifice all or part of its Eleventh Amendment immunity\nso that the attorney general can zealously advocate --\nQUESTION: But it's the State of Georgia's\nlegislature who have made the decision that's troubling\nfor the State of Georgia's employees.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, but the employees have\nto take the law as it is.\nQUESTION: Well, and the legislature didn't say\nthat no Georgia employee shall ever have an interlocutory\nappeal in any court. It had just said they don't happen\nin Georgia courts.\nMS. ORLAND: That's correct, and Congress has\nseen fit to allow for a procedural device for State\ndefendants or any other defendants to take advantage of\nthe procedures available to them. But nowhere did\nCongress --\nQUESTION: But you're missing one very key thing\nhere. Congress said in order to remove, all defendants\nmust remove. Those officers could not have been -- could\nnot have removed on their own. They had to have the\nState's consent. And for the State, after consenting, to\nsay, oh, we're going to accommodate you, we'll join in the\nremoval, but as soon as we get there, we're going to come\nout, it seems to me that is just the clearest end run\naround Congress' direction that all defendants have to\njoin in the removal petition. It would be a sham removal\nif someone were to say, okay, I agree to remove and be in\nthe Federal court, but the minute I get to Federal court,\nI'm going to say, Federal court, you can't get me.\nMS. ORLAND: First of all, Your Honor, Congress\ndid not expressly state that all defendants needed to\nagree. That is a court-created doctrine, and I'm not\ngoing to challenge the -- that doctrine.\nQUESTION: It's a court interpretation of the\nremoval statute.\nMS. ORLAND: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And -- and you're not going to\nchallenge that. So, it's as good as if it were in the\nstatute, just as the sovereign immunity doctrine, although\nit's not in the Eleventh Amendment, is there.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, all that is true. But\nCongress also contemplated the remand of certain claims.\nAnd the only thing the State is asking in this case is for\nthe case to be treated as if it were originally filed in\nFederal court, which it is our belief is the true intent\nof the congressional removal statute. They didn't allow\npartial claims to be brought up, and the reason they\ndidn't allow for it is because of the court's potential\nexercise of supplemental jurisdiction.\nBut in this case, there can be no exercise of\nsupplemental jurisdiction simply because the legislature\nfor the State of Georgia has not waived its sovereign\nimmunity as to the Georgia Tort Claims Act for actions\nwithin the courts of the United States.\nSo, in this case, by the exercise of a\nprocedural device, the attorney general would not be only\noverriding the very principles established in the concepts\nof federalism, but would also be overriding the -- the\ndecisions of the State legislature and the Georgia\nconstitution.\nQUESTION: Ms. Orland, then it seems to me the\nobvious thing that the zealous representative of the State\nwould say is, sorry, we can't join in the removal\npetition. This case belongs in State court and we're not\ngoing to engage in any subterfuge. We -- it's just as\nthough it were brought originally. It would be no good.\nSo, we are not going to go through the sham of signing our\nname onto a removal petition only to say that this case\ncan't be brought in Federal court. If the State were\nzealous in its position that only the State court can\nadjudicate this, it had no business signing on to any\nremoval petition.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, I understand the\nconcerns of the Court regarding the concept of saying\nwe're going to Federal court, but no, we're not. The --\nbut the reality of the removal statute is, is it doesn't\nallow for the removal of some claims, and that's a\nprocedural device available. If there's a remedy to be\nhad, the remedy to be had is with Congress. If there's a\nproblem with the removal statute not allowing certain\nclaims to be brought in Federal court and therefore the\nwhole case can't be removed --\nQUESTION: There's nothing wrong with the\nstatute. It says all defendants have to join in the\nremoval, and the removal has to be -- it seems to me that\nthe State of Georgia really is playing rather fast and\nloose with the -- with the Federal court when it says,\naha, we're going to bring this to accommodate -- to\naccommodate two people who couldn't do it on their own.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that the case on\nGeorgia's own theory is non-removable from day one, and\nthat's the position that Georgia should have taken. This\nis not a case for a Federal court.\nMS. ORLAND: Then by very virtue of a sham\njoinder of the State in a case, which in this case\narguably was done by suing the case -- State under 1983\nand further by attempting to sue the State, for which\nthere has been no waiver of sovereign immunity as to\ndefamation of liable, a plaintiff can shamly decide that\nindividuals won't be entitled to --\nQUESTION: The plaintiff in this case wanted to\nbe in the State court. It's the State that said Federal\ncourt. So, you can't -- this -- that's why this case is\nso puzzling because it's the plaintiff who wants to be in\nthe Federal court -- in the State court. And -- and the\nState wants to take it into the Federal court. It really\nis something that only a lawyer could conceive.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, I think that the\nproblem here is, is that by virtue of 1983 litigation,\nindividual employees get sued. And it does create sort of\na quandary of issues because the individuals have a\ndesire, quite understandably I'm sure, to get the case\nresolved, to --\nQUESTION: But -- but you're asking for a\nbroader principle, which it may well be that in -- in its\napplication to your case there's some -- you can\nunderstand why the -- why the State wanted to go into\nFederal court. But what you're asking for is the general\nprinciple that by coming into Federal court, you do not\nwaive State sovereign immunity, and that general principle\nwould have applied even if you had been the only defendant\nin the State court. And you removed to Federal court, and\nthen having gotten into Federal court, you moved to\ndismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity, which is absurd.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, I would agree it's\nabsurd, and that type of behavior could be sanctioned by\nthe court. If a lawyer is going to play those kinds of\ngames, it is certainly within the court -- district\ncourt's province to sanction ill-behavior. And that's\nwhat is being alleged that we did.\nBut what I would point out is that every --\nQUESTION: On what -- on what grounds would you\nsanction the behavior if you're saying that it's lawful.\nI don't understand that.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, if it --\nQUESTION: You're saying, counsel, you have\nexercised every right that we can give you under the law.\nWe're now sanctioning you for doing that. That -- I don't\nunderstand that.\nMS. ORLAND: I'm sorry if I misspoke. If a\nlawyer is going to remove a case and do it for the\npurposes of delay or some other misconceived purpose --\nQUESTION: Lawyers do all sorts of things for\nthe purposes of delay.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ORLAND: And it's improper.\nQUESTION: I'm not -- I'm not sure it is. I\nthink in many cases an attorney will look at two different\nchoices, particularly if you're a defendant, and you'll\nchoose the thing that will delay the case's final\nresolution. And nothing improper about that.\nMS. ORLAND: There's nothing improper about\nthat, but in the scenario that if it is improper, if it is\ndetermined that there is some attempt to elongate\nlitigation for an improper purpose, the court has the\ndiscretion to sanction that behavior.\nMoreover, Congress has the ability to change --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you're not -- they're not\nelongating the case. They're trying to terminate it in a\nhurry in this particular --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And I just don't understand how that\ncould possibly be sanctionable conduct if we say it's a\nproper usage of the removal statute and it doesn't waive\nsovereign immunity. They'll do it all the time.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, I'm not saying we did\nanything improper. I'm saying that in the event that\nsomebody did do something improper, that's sanctionable.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the question is whether this\nparticular maneuver is -- is authorized by law or not.\nAnd if it's authorized by law, it surely isn't improper.\nQUESTION: Indeed, it would be improper not to\ntake advantage of it.\nQUESTION: Sure.\nQUESTION: You should be sanctioned as\nincompetent counsel.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ORLAND: Hence, the quandary of being a\nState litigator, Your Honor. And that's exactly the\npoint. We have several clients here. The -- the attorney\ngeneral's office represents the individuals as well as the\nState entity on both State and Federal claims.\nYou're right. All of the Federal claims are\ngone. Even if you read at joint appendix 17 the\nplaintiff's assertion that he is seeking declaratory\nrelief, which I would suggest is not a clear statement of\ndeclaratory relief -- it is a request for declaratory\nrelief under State law. So, if the Court --\nQUESTION: It just occurred to me that maybe\nthere is sanctionable conduct here because you have a\nconflict of interest. Your interest in the employees is\ndefinitely directly opposed to your interest representing\nthe State. So, maybe you should have gotten separate\ncounsel.\nMS. ORLAND: Well, Your Honor, in fact at some\npoint in this litigation we did. But at the initial point\nof the removal, there was no reason to.\nAnd I think this goes to Justice Kennedy's\nconcurrence in Wisconsin, which is if the State is going\nto be placed in some tactical disadvantage, this rule\nshould not be adopted.\nThe tactical disadvantage in this case is quite\nsimple. The State would be at odds with its employees.\nThe State would not be in a position where there is no\nEleventh Amendment protection as to some claims perhaps --\nor it hasn't been decided yet for ADA Title II claims --\nto have a Federal court be the first to adjudicate those\ntypes of issues and have the fastest course to this Court\nfor a determination --\nQUESTION: The State would be at odds with its\nemployees because the employees want an interlocutory\nappeal and they can't get it in the State court?\nMS. ORLAND: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That -- that sort of thing arises\nfrequently. Do you move for a change of venue or not in a\nparticular case where you've got multiple defendants? And\nas Justice Stevens said, perhaps a lawyer ought not to\nhave multiple defendants if they're going to have\ndifferent -- different approaches to the thing.\nMS. ORLAND: Well, Your Honor, I think that's --\nthat's exactly the point here is -- and also the point as\nto why the attorney general, as the litigator on behalf of\nthe State and its employees, should not be in a position\nto make a decision as to waiver. That's why it goes to\nthe legislature.\nQUESTION: May I interrupt once more? I hate to\n-- I'm sorry --\nMS. ORLAND: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- I'm interrupting so many times.\nBut is it your position that the general rule\nshould be that removal waives the State's sovereign\nimmunity, but there should be an exception when there's a\ngood reason because of a conflict of interest? Or is your\n-- your position is that it will never waive sovereign\nimmunity?\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, the only time that it\ncould waive sovereign immunity is if the State legislature\nsays I authorize the attorney general --\nQUESTION: No. Absent a State legislature --\nyou're arguing for a general rule, not just for a rule\nthat will protect you in this particular case.\nMS. ORLAND: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Well, a general rule. My goodness.\nSuppose the State comes in and they have four claims and\nthey -- they wanted -- they say, oh, I have a great idea.\nI'm going to get this claim litigated over here in the\nFederal court and there are three related claims. It's a\nbankruptcy matter, for example, and they just pick and\nchoose. I mean, normally when -- when you have waiver in\nconstitutional law, say the Fifth Amendment, you -- you\nstart waiving answers to one question and related\nquestions are going to be waived too.\nMS. ORLAND: Well, Your Honor, and that's\nexactly the point, is there is no clear statement of\nwaiver here by Congress or the State legislature. I don't\nthink you can just pick and choose a waiver.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, I mean, but Justice\nStevens' question is that you're arguing for a general\nprinciple that -- that they don't waive anything. Is that\nright?\nThey -- they come into Federal court. Why did\nthey do it? They came into Federal court in all these\nothers because there was a claim they wanted litigated\neither for them or against the State. So, I would have\nthought they would at least have waived all related\nmatters.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, in all the cases relied\nupon by the petitioner where the State has come into\nFederal court, the court's first inquiry was whether the\nEleventh Amendment applied. In all of those cases, the\ncourt first found that the Eleventh Amendment simply was\ninapplicable. When the State is acting as a plaintiff or\nin any form or fashion or entering in as a party, it's not\na suit commenced or prosecuted against the State. The\npetitioner in this case conceded that the act of removal\ndoes not translate the State from a defendant to a\nplaintiff. Yet, they are asserting that the cases where\nthe State has entered in as a plaintiff somehow are\napplicable, and they are not applicable.\nQUESTION: But on your theory, even if the State\nhad come in as a plaintiff in the first place, you would\nhave sovereign immunity, wouldn't you? Because the\nlegislature hasn't waived it.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, the Eleventh Amendment\nwould just simply be inapplicable if the State entered as\n-- as a plaintiff.\nQUESTION: I thought you were claiming sovereign\nimmunity. I mean, it -- I mean, sovereign immunity today\nis something broader than the strict terms of the Eleventh\nAmendment, and I thought you were making the -- the full\nclaim.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I'm\nbaffled. But I think that sovereign immunity --\nQUESTION: Well, I have had that problem too in\nsome of the prior cases.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But I -- I haven't agreed with them,\nbut I -- I have to accept what they are. And -- and the\n-- the principle of sovereign immunity is a principle\ntoday that is not limited by the -- by the strict terms of\nthe Eleventh Amendment.\nMS. ORLAND: As was pointed out I guess in Alden\nis the Eleventh Amendment has stood for the greater\nprinciples of sovereign immunity, and I think that that's\nwhat we're talking about here. And I think it's also been\nconcretely held that the Eleventh Amendment in its broader\nprinciples perhaps doesn't apply to the State when it\nenters into an action as a plaintiff. And I think that\nthat's an entirely different -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: No. I -- I want to ask you a -- a\nkind of question which is subsumed -- a narrower question\nwhich is subsumed within the broader one, and that is\nlet's -- let's put this situation aside and assume that we\nhave the -- the conflict-free situation in which the\nemployees have their own counsel and the -- the State is\n-- is represented simply by -- by separate counsel. The\nemployees want to remove and the State, as -- as a\ndefendant separately represented, agrees to the removal.\nOn your theory, as I understand it, the State would still\nbe able at a later time to claim its immunity because the\nlegislature had not authorized that removal. Is that\ncorrect?\nMS. ORLAND: It's not that the legislature\nhasn't authorized the removal. It's that the legislature\nhasn't authorized a waiver of the State's immunity.\nQUESTION: All right. And -- and so, in -- in\nthat particular case that I -- I posed to you in which we\nhave separately represented defendants, the State consents\nto the removal. The State still would not have lost its\nimmunity by consenting to the removal.\nMS. ORLAND: No, it would not, Your Honor, and I\nthink --\nQUESTION: All right. Now, in that situation\nthen, how do you answer the argument that came up in the\nbriefs that that would give the -- the State the\nopportunity to sit back and see how things go? And if the\n-- if the case turns out well for them, they can claim the\n-- the judgment. If the State doesn't go well for them,\nthey can simply raise the question of immunity not only to\nescape the judgment, but to escape any estoppel later on.\nI mean, is -- is there any answer to that, or do you\nsimply say, yup, that's a great position to be in and\nthat's our position?\nMS. ORLAND: Well, Your Honor, first of all, I\nwould say that that is a different situation. Obviously\nthe Court knows that. But this Court's jurisprudence is\nconsistent with the State being able to assert its\nEleventh Amendment immunity at any time. The Court has\nnot differed from that jurisprudence.\nBut what I would point out in this case is the\nState was very up-front from the beginning. This\nwasn't --\nQUESTION: No, I'm not talking about this\nsituation. I'm talking about where your position leads\nus. And I take it that your position does lead us to the\n-- to the sort of the options that -- that I've just\ndescribed.\nMS. ORLAND: Your Honor, it does but -- and I\nthink that that would be consistent with this Court's\njurisprudence. But at the same time, I would suggest that\nthe State has a vested interest in not going to trial at\nall. So, I would suggest that since Ford, there probably\nhaven't been a lot of situations where the State has been\nin a position of litigating a case to the end, and it\nhasn't come up since Ford. So, I think that that's fairly\nsignificant.\nQUESTION: Ms. Orland, what if -- what if your\n-- your State attorney general brings suit in Federal\ncourt?\nMS. ORLAND: Then the Eleventh Amendment simply\ndoesn't apply.\nQUESTION: Why? He has no authority to waive\nsovereign immunity you say.\nMS. ORLAND: There's no waiver of sovereign\nimmunity --\nQUESTION: What about a counterclaim by the\ndefendant?\nMS. ORLAND: There's no dipping into the State's\npocket. The counterclaim can go as far as the defense.\nThis Court has repeatedly found that an entry into a forum\nor the beginning of suit allows the party being sued to\ndefend against the claim. But that's not the same as\ndipping into the State's pocket.\nWhat the petitioner is alleging is that somehow\nthe bifurcation of cases is an unheard of result and that\nit should be exchanged from the State's -- thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Orland.\nMs. Parsley, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIE C. PARSLEY\nON BEHALF OF TEXAS, ET AL.,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. PARSLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe decision to waive sovereign immunity and\nconsent to suit traditionally rests with the State's\nlegislature, a body uniquely able to both balance\nchallenges to the public fisc and determine when such a\nwaiver is both in the citizens' will and the public good.\nQUESTION: Have we inquired, when States bring a\nsuit in Federal court, whether the State attorney general\nhas authority to appear? Because, you know, when you come\nin Federal court and you're subject to a counterclaim.\nHave we -- have we asked district judges to inquire\nwhether the State attorney general has authority to waive\nsovereign immunity?\nMS. PARSLEY: No, Your Honor, the Court has not.\nQUESTION: We have not. And -- and is it your\nposition that as soon as a counterclaim is filed, what?\nThe whole suit has to be dismissed or -- or what -- what\nhappens then?\nMS. PARSLEY: No, Your Honor. Our position\nwould be that as to the -- the specific compulsory\ncounterclaim that may be litigated against the State as a\nplaintiff, that is permissible to the extent of the res.\nIn other words, when the State comes in as a plaintiff --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. To the extent -- I didn't\nhear the word.\nMS. PARSLEY: The res, the subject matter of the\nlitigation.\nQUESTION: So, you say the attorney general,\neven though he has no power to waive State sovereign\nimmunity, can achieve a waiver of State sovereign immunity\nby bringing suit which is subject to a compulsory\ncounterclaim.\nMS. PARSLEY: He does have the authority to\nrepresent the State, and presumably he has the authority\nalso by the legislature to bring the cause of action that\nhe is asserting with the State as a plaintiff.\nQUESTION: So, the same here when -- when he\ndoesn't have authority to waive sovereign immunity, but he\nhas authority to remove to Federal court. And if that\nresults in a waiver of sovereign immunity, so be it.\nMS. PARSLEY: But the two are specifically\ndifferent because, as a defendant, you're looking at this\n-- it would be an implied waiver as opposed to an express\nwaiver. As a plaintiff, even the United States, it has\nbeen admitted, they are not -- they are also subject to\nwaiver for compulsory counterclaims to the extent of the\nres. It has been --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that an implied waiver too?\nBrings suit -- the -- the State brings suit in Federal\ncourt is subject to a counterclaim. And you're saying\nthat the State is -- is subject to adjudication of that\ncounterclaim. Now, there's no express waiver there. It's\njust an implied waiver from bringing the action in Federal\ncourt. Why isn't removal the same?\nMS. PARSLEY: Well, that is the situation that\noccurred in Gardner, Your Honor, for the -- for the proof\nof claim instance with bankruptcy litigation. And that is\n-- so, it is not -- and it's not been seen as an implied\nwaiver because the State has put in issue the res and the\nsubject matter of the litigation.\nBut in this case --\nQUESTION: Well, you speak of the res of the\nlitigation. Supposing the State simply wants to collect a\nbad debt from somebody. There's no res. Maybe he doesn't\nhave anything at all. But it simply wants a money\njudgment against him for $100,000.\nMS. PARSLEY: Yes, Your Honor. That would be --\nthen the State would be able --\nQUESTION: There's no -- there's no res there.\nMS. PARSLEY: But it is the subject matter of\nthe litigation; that is, his -- that would be what the\nState would be adjudicating.\nIn this instant, what distinguishes it is that\nthe State is not transformed from a defendant to a\nplaintiff when it removes to Federal court, and the\nliteral text of the Eleventh Amendment proscribes cases\nprosecuted against a State.\nQUESTION: What happens under State law, say, in\nTexas if -- it's a tort action. It's against the State.\nEverybody in your office thinks that there is no sovereign\nimmunity, but just before the jury is about to come in,\nsomebody dredges up a statute and says, oh, my God, we had\nsovereign immunity. We forgot to make the defense.\nMS. PARSLEY: The Texas Supreme Court has held\nthat sovereign immunity is subject matter jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: So, in other words, you can come in\nin Texas, a jury is about to come in, you're just about to\nlose the case, the last minute you discover this defense,\nand just they'll -- they'll dismiss the case?\nMS. PARSLEY: That actually, to my knowledge,\nhas not happened yet. That case was decided only a couple\nof years ago.\nQUESTION: They wouldn't say you had waived it.\nMS. PARSLEY: No. We -- we would not assert\nthat we have waived --\nQUESTION: I know you wouldn't assert that. I\njust wonder what the judge in Texas --\nMS. PARSLEY: We would hope the judge would\nagree with us.\nBut that -- and that is. You put your finger on\nthe point that some -- that people dislike about sovereign\nimmunity. It does give the State superior rights in some\ninstances to other litigants, but that is because the\nState is a sovereign, just like the U.S. is a sovereign.\nThe immunity --\nQUESTION: I don't -- I don't object to that. I\nobject to -- to a dog in the manger, I mean, to say one\nthing and then say another thing. And here's the State\nsaying I want to be in Federal court and -- and gets there\nand the State says, I don't want to be in Federal court.\nI mean, that -- that's what I object to.\nMS. PARSLEY: Well --\nQUESTION: You can have all the sovereign\nimmunity you want. Just -- you know, just decide whether\nyou want it or don't want it.\nMS. PARSLEY: And all -- all we are really\nasking for, Justice Scalia, is to have the same defenses\nthat would be available to us if the plaintiff had chosen\nto file the lawsuit in Federal court. We are just\nemploying a procedural device to bring us into Federal\ncourt so that we can adjudicate the claims of our\nemployees and that, if we have defenses, they can be\nheard.\nQUESTION: Well, they could be adjudicated in\nState court, couldn't they? The Federal issues?\nMS. PARSLEY: They could be. They -- they could\nbe adjudicated in State court.\nQUESTION: What they don't like here is no\ninterlocutory appeal I gather.\nMS. PARSLEY: Yes, that is -- that's true.\nQUESTION: Well, that's the State's own fault.\nI mean, the State could have an interlocutory appeal if it\nchose to do so, couldn't it?\nMS. PARSLEY: They could, but in the Johnson\ncase, of course, this Court stated that the State courts\ndo not have to have a parallel system similar to the\nFederal courts.\nQUESTION: I take it the State of Texas is not\nasserting that its courts are less capable of interpreting\nFederal law than Federal courts are?\nMS. PARSLEY: Not -- not at all, Justice\nKennedy. Not at all. And we don't mean any disrespect in\nthat regard.\nQUESTION: In fact, you prefer your\ninterpretation of Federal law, don't you?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It seems to me everything that you've\nsaid leads to the conclusion that this was a non-removable\ncase from day one and that the State should not have --\nshould not have joined that removal petition.\nMS. PARSLEY: Actually that -- we do not agree\nwith that because there's no clear statement in the\nremoval statute indicating that the State would have\nwaived its immunity had it removed. Also, there's no\nsection 5 power on behalf of Congress to actually abrogate\nthe State's immunity. So --\nQUESTION: I don't get -- I don't get it all.\nIf the State is immune from suit in the Federal court,\nthen it seems to me it follows it has no authority to\nremove the case to the Federal court. It can't initiate\naction. It can't say, Federal court, hear this case, and\nthen say, Federal court, you don't have power to hear it.\nIt seems the two go together. If the Federal -- if the\nState is not amenable to suit in Federal court, the State\nis not positioned to remove the case to Federal court.\nMS. PARSLEY: But that would be similar to the\n-- to the argument they made in Schacht in that you cannot\nremove a case with barred claims. The removal statute\ndoes not prohibit the State -- States from removing --\nQUESTION: Not barred -- the statute of\nlimitations is a defense. You're saying that the -- the\nState has not consented to suit. As long as it doesn't\nconsent to suit in Federal court, it seems to me it's in a\nnon-removable position in the State court because either\nit's going to consent or it's not going to consent. If it\ndoesn't consent, it -- it doesn't have any authority to\nremove.\nMS. PARSLEY: Well, it may be a fine\ndistinction, but consenting to the removal, we would argue\nand is argued in the briefs, is not the same thing as\nconsenting to waive our Eleventh Amendment immunity. The\nonly way we could actually waive our Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity is if we were vested with that power by the\nlegislature. And Texas is not, Georgia is not. And under\nFord Motor Company, that's the appropriate analysis that\nthe court would engage in, whether we were --\nQUESTION: What -- what do you think is at stake\nnow? On the -- I think that you did -- you did bring up\nthe question of 1983 liability, that there -- that this\nwas not a Federal case to begin with. Is that -- is that\nright?\nMS. PARSLEY: I believe that -- that Georgia,\nwhen they moved -- when they answered, they both raised\nWill and the Eleventh Amendment in their answer. That is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: So, it seems to me that we are\narguing over an academic question because no matter what,\nthis case is going to return to the Georgia State court.\nMS. PARSLEY: It's not academic on this -- for\nthis point. This is really a reinvigoration of the\nimplied waiver doctrine that the Court fully rejected in\nCollege Savings Bank. This is -- the analogy is parallel\nto the market participation theory. In the market --\nmarket participation theory, the State was held as having\nwaived its immunity because it voluntarily engaged in an\nactivity --\nQUESTION: Yes, but all those could be very\ninteresting questions. The bottom line, no matter how you\nlook at this case, is it goes back to the State court.\nSo, if -- you -- you had said initially no 1983 liability.\nRight? And that the Federal court should --\nMS. PARSLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I had thought that in the recent\ncase we had said if you have that picture, the Federal\ncourt is supposed to deal with the 1983. Wasn't it\nVermont Agency?\nMS. PARSLEY: Yes, Vermont Agency. The\nstatutory question.\nQUESTION: Yes, right.\nMS. PARSLEY: That it could be dealt with first,\nyes.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. PARSLEY: That is entirely possible, and the\ndistrict court -- it would have been well advised to have\ndone that, but the district court did not choose to do\nthat. Instead, it ruled on the Eleventh Amendment.\nQUESTION: But in any -- any way you look at\nthis, the case ends up in -- in the State court. So, it\nseems to me that you really are arguing an academic\nquestion.\nMS. PARSLEY: Well, to the extent that the\npetitioner is challenging the Eleventh Circuit's judgment,\nthey do want to remain in Federal court. And so,\ntherefore, they are actually challenging the judgment and\nnot just the opinion. So, there is a justiciable question\non appeal.\nI did want to say quickly that in relation to\nthe implied waiver doctrine, that a State shouldn't have\nto choose between what is an otherwise legal activity,\nwhich is removal, and the forfeiture of its immunity.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Parsley.\nMr. Bederman, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDERMAN: If I may, Justice Ginsburg, I was\nnot entirely as helpful as I could have been in response\nto your earlier lines of questioning.

BEDERMAN: Yes, sir, I am.\nQUESTION: Well, that just says, I want a\njudicial finding that what Kansas did amounts to\ndefamation. I take it that's a defamation claim under\nState law. What has that got to do with it?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, I think, of course, all\nparagraphs in a complaint need to be read together in view\nof the earlier allegations, in view of this course of\nconduct interfering with Professor Lapides'\nconstitutionally granted due process rights at both\nparagraphs 1 and at paragraph 8 of the complaint. I think\nwhen read together, paragraph 26 fairly raises in terms\nof --\nQUESTION: Read them together. I just read it.\nWhat he says is I want a judicial finding that Kansas\nState action gives rise to a new -- is defamatory, thereby\ngiving rise to a new cause of action every time the\ninformation is published. Okay? Read it together so it\nstates a Federal claim. I'm not saying you can't. I just\nwant to hear it.\nMR. BEDERMAN: No. I'm not sure on the bare\nterms of paragraph 26 that the request for declaratory\nrelief is particularly tied to a Federal cause of action.\nAll I can point the Court to is both paragraphs 1 and 8 of\nthe complaint which frame the Federal question.\nIf I may, in terms of -- of a second point,\nabout the concern for tactical disadvantage that the State\nmay be put in, if the Court rules either that removal\nconstitutes waiver, that the Georgia Supreme Court in a\n1994 decision made clear that denials of qualified\nimmunity defenses are subject to immediate certification\nfor appeal by trial court judges. So, I think it's\nextravagant to suggest that under Georgia law currently\nthat there is no effective mechanism for the review,\nimmediate review, of -- of denials of qualified immunity\ndefenses. And this is more fully explained at reply brief\npage 11 filed by the petitioner.\nIf I may make one last point, and that is by no\nmeans is petitioner asserting that by virtue of removal,\nplaintiffs become defendants and defendants become\nplaintiffs. Instead, our submission is simply that\nremoval is a forum selection, that when the State engages\nin that forum selection, it is waiving, for purposes of\nthe case and the authority of the Federal courts to\nadjudicate, the State's forum immunity under the Eleventh\nAmendment.\nIf there are no other --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't mean to pursue a red\nhorse. I just don't want to miss something if it's there.\nWhere in paragraph 1 or 8 does it ask for a declaration?\nMR. BEDERMAN: It does -- neither paragraph 1\nnor 8 specifically refers to declaratory relief. If you\n-- if you flip to the prayer for relief at pages 18 and\n19, of course, most of it is for -- for monetary damages.\nBut, of course, the last prayer is for all relief that the\ncourt may deem just and proper.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you. Thank you,\nMr. Bederman.\n"
