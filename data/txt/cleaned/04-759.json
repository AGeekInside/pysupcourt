MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives the sovereign\nimmunity of the United States for the torts of Federal\nemployees when private persons in like circumstances would\nbe liable. But instead of applying private-person\nprinciples of liability, the Ninth Circuit looked to the\nState and governmental-entity principles of liability. It\nconcluded that the United States could be liable here,\nbecause Arizona has decided to hold its governmental\nentities liable when State employees are negligent.\nThat decision is wrong, for two reasons. First,\nit is contrary to the plain text of the Federal Tort\nClaims Act. The Federal Tort Claims Act makes clear that\nthe liability of the United States is to be judged by the\nprinciples of private-person liability in the place where\nthe tort occurred. In section 1346(b)(1), the Federal\nTort Claims Act allows jurisdiction and waives the\nsovereign immunity of the United States under\ncircumstances where the United States, if a private\nperson, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with\nthe law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I understand that you would\naccept the rule that if Arizona held a private inspector\nliable to third persons for their injuries, then the\nGovernment of the United States would be liable? It's not\nquite the Good Samaritan -- not quite the Good Samaritan\ntype, but you would accept that as the proper measure of\nyour liability in a case like this?\nMS. MAYNARD: As long as Arizona applied that\nprinciple of liability to private persons in Arizona.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. So, it will\ndepend on what the particular State's law is. Here, the\nonly private-person law that was argued below was the Good\nSamaritan doctrine, and -- as a possible analogy to the\nconduct of the mine inspectors here. But it might --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It gets ahead of the argument\njust a little bit, but you had a footnote about police\nofficers. You have a park ranger, Federal employer. Is\nthe analog there that we look to -- what the duties of a\nprivate security guard would be -- what do you do with\nthose cases?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, those cases, as we note, do\npresent, often, special circumstances not present in this\ncase, Justice Kennedy. But the answer to the question\nthat's presented here is the same. You still would look\nto whether or not there is private -- a private-person\nanalog. And, if there is, then you would look to the\nliability of private persons in that circumstance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, even with the police\nofficer, I have to find a private analog.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, you do. For example, if\nsomeone brought a trespass action against a Federal law\nenforcement officer for entering upon their land, you\nwould apply the same State law as it relates to trespass\nclaims against private persons. Those claims may, for\nexample, have a defense of lawful authority to enter.\nWhen looking at whether or not a police officer had -- a\nFederal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might\nthen look to Federal law to determine whether or not the\nofficer had authority to enter, but you would still be\napplying the principles of private-person liability.\nIf one concluded that there was no private-\nperson analog, then the only answer under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act would be that the United States cannot be\nliable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, that's\nkind of a $64,000 question here. Give me an example where\nyou think there's no private-person analog.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we think\nit's often rare that there is no private-person analog,\ngiven this Court's decision in Indian Towing, which\nstresses --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- that one should look to a\nprivate person in like circumstances. I think this Court,\nin Feres, although that decision has been -- has been\nlimited -- did determine that there was, in that\nsituation, no private-party analog --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there always a\nprivate -- I mean, we're talking about tort law -- isn't\nthere always a private analog, which is, you know,\nexercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward\npeople to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that\ngeneral principle?\nMS. MAYNARD: To the extent you're suggesting\nthat we just look to general theories of tort law, I think\nthat would be incorrect. The -- because the Tort Claims\nAct -- the language of the Tort Claims Act makes the\nUnited States liable only where a private party in like\ncircumstances would be liable. And in Indian Towing, this\nCourt defines \"in like circumstances\" as looking to the\nsame character of conduct of the -- of the person. So,\nyou would have to find a private person who's engaged in\nthe same character of conduct, and then ask the question,\nWhat principles of liability does the State apply to those\npersons? Here, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all right, so if\nit's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's\nthe same as a private security guard stopping somebody at\na -- you know, the driveway at a plant or something.\nMS. MAYNARD: That may be the closest private-\nperson analog. In that situation, however, when one goes\nto apply the defense, it's just as one would if talking\nabout a private security guard. One would ask the\nquestions whether the guard had the requisite authority.\nAnd the State would look to what that guard's authority\nwas. And often States would look -- if the guard happened\nto be a Federal officer, would look to Federal law. And\nthat can be appropriate, I think, for -- under,\npotentially, three different -- for, potentially, three\ndifferent reasons. One, the language of the defense in\n2680(a), which provides the United States with a defense\nto liability in circumstances where , with due care, you're\ncarrying out a Federal statute or regulation. It --\nanother source of authority might be the State-law\nprinciples simply look to what the authority of the person\ndoing the conduct is, and then you would look to Federal\nlaw for the source of that authority. And that could be\nright, under this Court's suggestion in Muniz, that\nFederal regulations -- once an actionable duty is\nestablished under State tort principles, one can look to\nFederal regulations to determine whether or not -- what\nthe applicable standard of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you back --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- care was.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- up in Muniz a little bit?\nBecause that was a prison administration. And so, what\nis the private-party analog to that?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think this Court suggested, in\nMuniz, that perhaps there could be private persons\noperating prisons, or one would look --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't recall --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- in that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that in the decision. The\nphrase from the Tort Claims Act about \"as a private party\"\nwas repeated, but I don't remember any discussion of what\nthat private party would be, in Muniz.\nMS. MAYNARD: You may be right, Justice\nGinsburg. I think the important point to take away from\nMuniz is that the Court stressed that, whatever the\nmeasure of the United States' liability would be for the\nclaims at issue in that case, it could not be the State\nlaw as it related to governmental entities; that one would\nhave to, as the text requires, look to State law as it\nrelates to private persons. The point that I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because in those days the\nGovernment was arguing it should be like State officials.\nMS. MAYNARD: For purposes of obtaining\nimmunity, we were arguing that -- which I think is a\ndifferent argument than we're making here today -- we were\narguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act was not meant to\nwaive our sovereign immunity at all with respect to\ncertain types of governmental activities. But that's not\nthe argument that we're making today. Today, we are\narguing simply that one must, as the Court held in Indian\nTowing and Rayonier, one should look to the -- to the --\nto the text of the statute, and that that must be the\nmeasure of our liability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, what would you\ndo if Arizona had a statute that said that any company\nthat contracts privately to do mine inspections must obey\nthe standards in the Federal guidelines? What would the\nstandard be?\nMS. MAYNARD: That presents a difficult\nquestion, Justice Stevens, as I'm sure you know.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. MAYNARD: And that would, obviously, be a\nharder case than the one that we have here, and -- which I\nwould like to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you say --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- address how you apply it here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and I think you're probably\nright --\nMS. MAYNARD: If --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that you can't just make a\nFederal -- implied Federal cause of action under the\nFederal standards, from what we know. But then I was\nwondering, What if the Arizona statute said that's what\nthe private firm should do?\nMS. MAYNARD: If a State statute looked to\nFederal law as the source -- I think one has to be careful\nwhen one talks about \"negligence per se\" type principles,\nwhich is what you're suggesting -- some States look to\nstatutes and regulations solely to establish a standard of\ncare once a separate duty has been established. And some\nStates, as respondents claim Arizona does, look to it\nestablish both duty and a standard of care.\nBut, putting that aside, if -- to respond\ndirectly to your question -- if a State adopted a Federal\nstatute and used it to apply to private persons, you would\nbe most of the way home in getting Federal Tort Claims Act\n-- at least the creation of potential liability against\nthe United States. However, I think in that instance,\nthere would still be a question as to the intent of\nCongress, in the Federal statute itself that was used, as\nto whether Congress intended to foreclose any private\naction, any private enforcement, such that the States --\nif the State has misinterpreted, in other words, a Federal\nlaw, that presents, I think, a Federal question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm assuming they just did\nit independently. They said, \"We want a regulation on the\nprivate mine inspectors, and let's just adopt the -- a\nstandard that shall, in all respects, be the same as the\nFederal standard.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: If they're just simply borrowing\nit, and don't feel compelled to borrow it, and are,\nindeed, applying it to private persons who perform safety\ninspections, then the United States could potentially be\nliable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. As I mentioned\nhere, though, that is definitely not this case, because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it seems to me that\nthat's quite a foreseeable possibility. If there is such\na thing as private safety inspectors in Arizona -- I'm not\nsure, but if there are, I assume that what they do is,\nwhen they go into a particular industrial area, they look\nat the safety standards for that industry, including\nFederal and State regulations. So, if you have a mine\ninspector, then it seems to me that his liability might\nvery well be measured by whether or not he's inspected the\nmine in accordance to Federal safety standards.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I have several answers to\nthat question, Justice Kennedy. First, your use of\n\"standards\" there appears not to be one to create an\nactual duty in the first instance, which is really the\nquestion before this Court. Is there any duty between the\nUnited States and the private miners? Secondly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I thought we said,\nat the outset -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if Arizona\nimposes liability on private safety inspectors for\ninjuries to third persons, then the United States would be\nliable here.\nMS. MAYNARD: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize\nyou were still operating --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was the --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- under Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- hypothetical.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- Stevens' hypothetical. If\nArizona has created an actionable tort duty that it\nimposed -- that it's willing to impose upon its private\ncitizens who perform safety inspections, to all persons\nwho work at places where they perform safety inspections,\nthat would be a different case. Then that would be\napplying the law as it relates to private persons in like\ncircumstances.\nHere, though, it's clear from the cases we\ndiscuss in our brief, including Easter and Papastathis,\nthat Arizona -- when private parties perform safety\ninspections on the property of another, Arizona applies\nits Good Samaritan doctrine. That is not -- in order to\ndetermine, at the outset, whether there's any actionable\nduty between the inspectors and the injured party. That's\nthe step that the Ninth Circuit did not engage in here.\nThe Ninth Circuit, instead, decided --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand.\nMS. MAYNARD: Okay. So, the -- and the reason\nthat you can't, in this case, follow Justice Stevens'\nreasoning is because the only provisions of law to which\nthe respondents point to set the negligence per se\nprinciples are policy manuals and procedures of the coal\n-- Federal Mine Act that apply only to Federal employees.\nSo, they point to no case or law where these provisions,\nupon which they rely, would impose either a duty or a\nstandard of care upon private persons in Arizona. Now,\nin that -- to distinguish it -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In your view -- even though\nthe Federal standard would not be controlling, in your\nview, if you applied a general reasonable-person test,\nwould the Federal standards be admissible so that the\nplaintiff could argue that there was a failure here which\nis evidence of negligence?\nMS. MAYNARD: In many States, one would look to\nFederal standards for setting the standard of care. And\nwe think that it could be relevant here what the -- but\nyou must get over the duty hurdle. And that, respondents\ncannot do by looking to State and governmental-entity\nliability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you say that it may be\nrelevant, are you thinking of 2680(a)? Because 2680(a)\nsays, you know, if you exercise due care, any act that you\ntake in the -- in -- well, let's use the exact language --\n\"any act or omission in the execution of a statute or\nregulation will not be a ground of liability,\" with -- at\nleast leaving open the door that any failure to take steps\nthat would have been reasonable in executing it might be.\nIs that why you answered Justice Stevens as you did?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, just to take your question,\nand then maybe clarify what you mean by what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me --\nMS. MAYNARD: I can --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- ask it --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- I can -- I can answer it the\n26- --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Look, I don't have to cross-\nreference --\nMS. MAYNARD: Good.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it to Justice Stevens.\nMS. MAYNARD: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Give me an example of the -- of\nthe function of 2680(a). When would there be liability,\nbut for that provision?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think -- obviously, you\ndon't get to 2680(a) unless you've gotten through the\nfirst part and established --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- that there's some actionable\nduty on private persons in like circumstances and that we\nmight be liable. If you do get over that hurdle -- say,\nfor example, the State standard of care with -- in\nrelation to private parties is higher than that required\nby Federal statute -- imagine a Federal regulation that\nrequires VA doctors to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I could -- I could --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- take care of their patients\nonce a day.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I could understand that if\nthey -- it would be an easier question for me if the\nstatute said, \"Even if you violate the statute, if you\notherwise use reasonable care, no liability.\" But here,\nit talks about reasonable care when you are -- when you\nare, in the statutory phrase, in the execution of the\nstatute, which suggests to me you're not violating the\nstatute, you're not violating any standard. So, what\nfunction does it serve?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, it can serve functions in\nother instances; for example, if someone alleges that you\nwere following the statute, but the statute was invalid.\nBut I think in terms of a -- because it goes on to say\nwhether or not the -- the regulation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, it's really --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- is valid.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the validity is the -- is\nthe nub of the provision.\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I was just saying\nit has that other function. I think, here, the short\nanswer to your question is, if this -- if, when you're\ntalking about the -- what's an appropriate standard of\ncare once one's established an actionable duty -- if the\nState law, as it relates to private persons, set a more\nstringent standard of care than the Federal regulation,\nfor example, and the Federal employee were complying with\nthe standard of care set forth in the Federal regulation\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Of the Federal -- I -- okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- this could potentially provide\na defense, even though, once you went through the first\npart of the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't understand the\n-- are you sure that a failure to execute a statute does\nnot come within the language, \"an act or omission,\" in the\nexecution of a statute? I would think a total failure\nto execute is an omission in the execution of the statute.\nMS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean if you executed 90\npercent and omit 10 percent of what you're supposed to do,\nit comes within that language, but if you don't execute at\nall, it doesn't? That seems to me most unlikely. I mean\nit seems to me --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: She's saying \"execution\" is not\nsynonymous with \"performance,\" which may well be correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Well, you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I had assumed that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you accepted, it seemed to\nme, the premise of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- Justice Souter's question,\nwhich is that (a) -- 2680(a) only applies to a failed\nexecution. There has to be at least an attempted\nexecution. I'm not sure that's true. It says \"an act or\nomission\" in the execution. And I think a total -- I just\ndon't do the thing at all. I think that's an omission in\nthe execution.\nMS. MAYNARD: I must be missing the thread of\nthe question somewhere. I was just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- I was trying to make just --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you've --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- a simple, modest point that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- you've still answered my\nquestion. I mean, you're -- you have said, \"Assuming that\nthe individual is executing the statute, there is no\ndeficiency in the performance of executing the statute.\nThere is still this function.\" And I think I understand\nyour answer. But, I mean, I think Justice Scalia's point\nis correct, it may apply in cases in which you are\npurporting to act under the statute, but you omit actions\nthat you should take. In other words, your performance is\ndeficient. And there, the answer is easier, because it\nsays as long as you're exercising due care, no liability.\nMS. MAYNARD: We may still have a defense in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- that situation. I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- that's correct. It's an\nimportant point --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an argument that\nwas made in your brief, and I didn't fully grasp the\nthrust of it, in the -- that is, you said that the Mine\nSafety and Health Administration has a duty to the\nSecretary of Labor, but not to the mine operator and not\nto the miner. If that were true, then would there be --\nyou wouldn't even get to the Good Samaritan doctrine,\nwould you, if the only duty is to the Secretary of Labor?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think that, in fact, would\nbe an application of the Good Samaritan doctrine, Justice\nGinsburg. In other words, I think you're referring to the\nfirst part of the -- we have an -- we believe we have an\nargument. And the Daggett case, which we cite, addresses\nwhether -- I think this is an open question in Arizona law\nunder their interpretation of the Good Samaritan doctrine\n-- whether someone in the position of the United States\nhere is -- has undertaken to render services to another.\nBecause that's the argument to which you're referring, I\nbelieve. And we think there is an argument that we are\nnot rendering services to another. But that is not the\nsame as saying that the Good Samaritan doctrine -- that is\nan application of the Good Samaritan doctrine. In other\nwords, courts, when they -- these are all factors that\ntake into account whether someone will have a duty,\npursuant to the Good Samaritan doctrine -- one of the\nfactors is that you must have undertaken to render\nservices to another. Another factor, which we think is\nalso relevant here, is whether or not the injured party\njustifiably and detrimentally relied. And we don't think\n-- you know, they have asked you to decide this question\n-- we think this is more appropriate a question for\nremand, but the United States does not believe that the\nrespondents can make out either of those elements of the\nGood Samaritan doctrine, and that the United States,\ntherefore, cannot ultimately be liable only -- under the\nonly available private-person analogy.\nBut the important point is, you -- that is an\napplication of the Good Samaritan doctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not sure that the\nGood Samaritan doctrine is the -- is necessarily what the\nArizona law would be -- what the analog would be.\nMS. MAYNARD: In our view, it's the only\nprivate-person law that respondents argued to the Ninth\nCircuit. Respondents have submitted a new argument to\nthis court contending that governmental-entity law and\nprivate-party law in Arizona is equivalent in this\nsituation. But that is wrong. It is clear that the State\nof Arizona, as a public-policy matter, has decided to\ncreate broader, actionable tort duties on its own\ngovernmental employees, and to expose itself and open its\nown coffers to -- when -- to claims when its employees\nhave injured its citizens. But that is not the same law\nthat they apply to private persons, and we know that from\nthe Daggett case, which we discuss -- I believe it's on\npage 6 of our reply brief.\nIn the Daggett case, that was a case involving\nan inspection by a county of a swimming recreation area,\npursuant to mandatory State and county regulations that\nrequired such inspections. The Arizona Court of Appeals\nthere held that there was a duty by the county to a person\nwho had -- who dove into the swimming pool and was injured\nas a result of hitting the bottom, that there was an\nactionable duty running against the county there as a\nmatter of the State of Arizona's decision to create tort\nduties when its employees and governmental entities violate\nmandatory obligations or perform them negligently.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, may I interrupt\nand just ask this? Do we have to decide what the Arizona\nrule is in order to decide the main question presented --\nnamely, whether the analogy to Arizona public officials is\nsufficient?\nMS. MAYNARD: Not necessarily, Justice Stevens.\nWe think it's perfectly clear, from the text of the\nstatute and the language of the Ninth Circuit's decision,\nthat what they did is improper.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm just wondering if\nyou're not discussing a State-law issue that has not been\ndecided by either court below or really fully argued here.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, it has not -- the -- whether\nor not there's an equivalency, whether or not private\npersons are liable in the same instances as State and\ngovernmental entities, was not argued by the respondents\nbelow.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMS. MAYNARD: And, therefore, it was not\ndecided. We do not think -- it is a question of State\nlaw, but we think the answer is very clear, because\nrespondent -- the only thing respondents point to here to\nassert that there is an equivalent are cases making State\nand county and governmental entities liable. They point\nto nothing, as they concede, cases involving private\npersons.\nSo, there -- if -- we don't think the Court\nshould remand, which would be an invitation to the Ninth\nCircuit to essentially do, under another guise, what it\nhas already done, which is essentially apply governmental-\nentity liability to the United States, in contradiction to\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I wouldn't do that.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- text of the statute.\nIf I can finish my Daggett answer, though,\nJustice Stevens, I think that'll make clear why the two\nare distinct and why it isn't a difficult question of\nArizona law.\nThe Daggett court went on to decide that the\ncounty, although it had a duty to the injured party\npursuant to governmental entity law, similar to what the\nNinth Circuit applied to us here, there would be no\nactionable duty if one applied the Good Samaritan\ndoctrine. It found that none of the second three prongs\nof the Good Samaritan doctrine were met, and it also\nraised the question as to whether or not someone in the\nposition of the county would even be rendering services\ninto another sufficient to meet that part of the Good\nSamaritan doctrine.\nSo, we think it is very clear that the two are\nnot the same. The -- so, we would ask that the Court not\nremand, and leave that question open, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just a background\nquestion. I'm curious, was ASARCO sued here, or -- and is\nits liability capped by workmen's comp laws, or?\nMS. MAYNARD: I do not know whether they were\nactually sued. There are -- their -- I do believe their\nliability, though, is that workers' comp is an exclusive\nremedy here. And, although it's not in the record in this\ncase, the State of Arizona was also sued, and, according\nto news reports, settled for substantial sums with both of\nthe respondents.\nIf there are no further questions at this time,\nI would like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Maynard.\nMr. Cotter.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. COTTER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. COTTER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nI'd like to begin by addressing the last point\nmade by the Office of the Solicitor General, which is the\nDaggett case. And I address that merely to highlight that\nthis is a State law issue. It -- the Daggett case did not hold,\nas the Solicitor General maintains, that under Arizona law\nthere would be no duty under the restatement sections 323\nor 324. In fact, what the Court says in remanding the\ncase because they found a duty under the county\nregulations, is, \"We assume, without deciding, that there\nis a claim under 324 and -- 323 and 324, and note simply\nthat there are no allegations in the plaintiff's complaint\nthat would satisfy those issues.\" So, they simply say,\nbecause there's additional litigation coming, they were\ngiving heads up to the party that he needs to amend the\ncomplain to assert the Good Samaritan elements.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question that\nJustice Kennedy just brought up? Did this -- did Mr.\nOlson collect, under the State workers' compensation\nstatute, from the mine operators?\nMR. COTTER: Your Honor, Mr. Olson did collect,\nunder the State workers' compensation statute, from the\nmine operator, that is correct, as did Mr. Vargas. And,\nin fact, the State of Arizona was sued -- the State mine\ninspector -- alleging that they were negligent, and that\ncase was resolved. That -- a point of interest in that\ncase is that in that case, the State -- because Arizona is\na pure comparative-negligence State -- alleged that the\nFederal mine inspector was partially at fault and that,\ntherefore, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vargas' damages should be\nreduced, just as, in our case, if we had proceeded beyond\nthe motion-to-dismiss phase, we could have anticipated, as\nis common, that the Federal Government would have\nidentified the State of Arizona and the mine operator to\nbe non-parties at fault, as well, so that those\nindividuals -- the negligence of those individuals would\nreduce the plaintiff's damages against the Federal\nGovernment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the mine\noperator -- the Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy\nunder Arizona law, so the -- nobody could get anything\nmore from the mine operator. Is that so?\nMR. COTTER: That is correct. In the interest\nof candor, I have to tell Your Honor that we sued the\nparent company to the mine operator, which is Grupo\nMexico, in an attempt to assert a claim, and that case was\nresolved only by some -- by making some concessions on the\nworkers' compensation lien issues that the workers'\ncompensation carrier had back against the claimants for\ntheir recovery from the State of Arizona.\nI hope that's clear. But, generally, workers'\ncompensation carriers have a right to get repaid if\nthere's some private settlement, and concessions were made\non that right, because of the -- suing the parent company,\nand that case was never resolved on the merits.\nTo begin, Your Honor, this came to the Ninth\nCircuit from a motion to dismiss. And that has\nsignificance to this -- to this question, because the\nplaintiffs were not able to develop the factual record\nwhich goes to the issues of whether or not there would be\nliability under the State law -- the Good Samaritan law or\nunder -- issues about assumption of duty under State law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that goes to the remand\nquestion raised --\nMR. COTTER: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- earlier.\nMR. COTTER: -- it does --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't go to\nwhether the Ninth Circuit was correct here.\nMR. COTTER: Well, in a roundabout way, it does,\nJustice Scalia, because what happened was, the Ninth\nCircuit was faced with the task, under the Federal Tort\nClaim Act, of deciding whether -- if the Federal\nGovernment -- the Federal mine inspectors, if you would --\nwere private people under like circumstances, would they\nbe liable? So, the Ninth Circuit was essentially asked a\nhypothetical question by the Federal Tort Claim, and it\nwas asked to resolve that question on a motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim, which the standard is, of\ncourse, that we can set -- we can prove no facts which\nwould -- which would establish a cause of action. And\nwhat the court really did, because the court applied a\nbody of law -- the Ninth Circuit -- that began with the\nLouie doctrine -- is, the court looked at Arizona mine-\ninspector law as a predictor to what Arizona private-\nperson law would be.\nAnd from Justice Roberts' questions about police\nofficers, in the Louie case, the State of Washington, like\nthe State of Arizona, had waived sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, that might have\n-- you might have won if they had said, \"We're going to\nlook to see what the law is in Arizona governing a private\nperson who performs a similar kind of inspection. And we\ndecide that it's the same.\" You would have won that, I\nguess. But you didn't, because they didn't. That isn't\nwhat they said.\nMR. COTTER: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is, we're not looking to\nthe law governing private persons, we are just looking at\nlaw governing municipalities, and they're -- it seems to\nme they are pretty clearly wrong about that, unless you\ngive me a reason why they're right.\nMR. COTTER: Well, Your Honor, what -- our\nposition is that, although they applied the law of\nmunicipalities and the State, what they were really doing\nis applying the Louie doctrine, which says that when you\ncannot identify a private actor, then the best evidence of\nwhat the State's law is, with respect to the actions of a\nparty in the same circumstances, is to look at the State\nliability, and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a good question.\nSuppose you really had a person who -- there's just no\ncomparable private person in like circumstances. I can't\neven imagine what that could be. Maybe you could imagine.\nBut I was trying to think of some secret research on\nturning people invisible or something for military\npurposes. I mean, I -- it's just hard -- I mean, hard\nhere, obviously. There is such a person. There are\nprivate mine inspectors.\nMR. COTTER: Well, actually, I'm not aware of\nany private mine inspectors, but if we want to take that\nthought --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe there are not --\nMR. COTTER: If the private mine inspector had\nthe -- assumed the same duties, so it's under like\ncircumstances, that the Federal mine inspector had here,\nwhich was to inspect the mine in its entirety four times\nper year and to respond to all safety-related complaints\nand determine whether they present imminent hazards, and\nto remove the miners from the area -- if those are the\ncharacteristics of the private individual under like\ncircumstances, then I concede that would be a better\npredictor of State -- and if we knew what Arizona would\ndecide in that context, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cotter, I don't -- I don't\nsee, in the opinion, any indication that the Ninth Circuit\nwas doing what you -- what you assert it was trying to do\n-- namely, to predict what future California law -- locked\ndeep in the bosom of the California Supreme Court, but not\nyet disclosed to the public -- will hold. It didn't\nproceed that way at all. It says, generally, the United\nStates can be held liable only when liability was attached\nto a private actor. However, the United States may be liable,\nquoting from one of the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases, for the\nperformance of some activities that private persons do not\nperform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable\nunder the law where the activity occurred. I don't see they are\nsaying, \"We are trying to predict what California would do\nin a private situation.\" They have set forth a rule that,\nwhere there's no cause of action against a private person,\nwe look to whether there would be a cause of action under\n-- against a State or subdivision of the State.\nMR. COTTER: Justice Scalia, I concede that the\nCourt has accurately characterized the opinion. If I\nremember the cases cited by the opinion, they're Concrete\nTie and Hines, which lead directly back to the Louie\nopinion, which was the decided at the behest of the\nGovernment, because, in Louie, there was a law enforcement\noperator who -- a law enforcement official who failed to\nstop a drunk driver, and they said, \"There is\" -- the\nGovernment said, \"There is no private person here.\" And,\ntherefore, if you look to Washington State law, which does\nnot impose liability in these circumstances, you get a\ngood idea of what Washington law would rule if there were\na private person.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How long ago was that -- was\nLouie decided?\nMR. COTTER: Your Honor, I believe it was about\n20 years ago.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Twenty years ago. And\nWashington still has not yet made this prediction come\ntrue, I gather.\nMR. COTTER: You mean it has not ruled on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMR. COTTER: -- the subject?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has not extended its\nGovernment Tort Claims Act to private citizens.\nMR. COTTER: I think -- I think that the Federal\nTort Claim Act does not apply to private citizens in\nWashington.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm saying the prediction\nthat Louie made had not yet come true. There is still no\nWashington decision that has done what Louie said it would\n--\nMR. COTTER: Would not do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- would be done.\nMR. COTTER: Louie predicted that there would be\nno liability. And, in fact, I think that that remains the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but Louie, according to\nthe SG, says, \"We say here that this person is not liable\n-- the Government is not liable, because, in Washington,\nWashington would not make a municipality liable,\" while\nadding that the law of Washington is that a municipality\nis liable only if a private person in Washington is\nliable. So, I wouldn't think Louie is very good authority\nthat the Ninth Circuit thought it was for the proposition\nthat you look not to the private person, but you look to\nonly the municipality.\nMR. COTTER: If I understand Your Honor's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm just --\nMR. COTTER: -- point --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- reading from their brief.\nWhat they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence\nis important. The equivalence of what? Under Washington\nlaw, State and municipal government entities are liable\nonly to the same extent as a private person. And they\ncite page 825. And they stress this equivalence, because\na finding of immunity for State employees under State law\ndoes not determine the scope of the U.S. liability, etcetera.\nMR. COTTER: And, in fact, Your Honor, the\nequivalence factor in Louie is present in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, anyway, if Louie helps\nsomething other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it?\nBecause what the statute says is, it's a question of\nlooking to the --\nMR. COTTER: We --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- private person.\nMR. COTTER: The respondents concede that the\nquestion is \"private person under like circumstances.\" We\nconcede that point. Our point is simply that, on a motion\nto dismiss, the Ninth Circuit was faced with trying to\ndecide: What would Arizona law be with a private person\nunder like circumstances?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it didn't try to do that.\nIt made no effort to do that. It just said -- it just\nsaid the United States may be liable when a State or\nmunicipal entity would be held liable. It made no effort\nto figure out what Washington would do with a private\nindividual.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the -- in the face of\na district court opinion that applied the Good Samaritan\nstatute and threw the case out because no allegation could\nbe made to come within the Good Samaritan statute. So, it\nseems pretty clear that they're doing something quite different\nfrom what you're suggesting.\nMR. COTTER: Well, Justice Roberts, our\ncontention is that the genesis of the doctrine that they\napplied, and that the Fifth Circuit applies, and that the\nD.C. circuit applies, is to predict State law, that its\npurpose is not to expand liability where State law doesn't\nexist. In fact, if you read the opinion of the Ninth\nCircuit in this case, it acknowledges that private person\nis the test. But then it says that when we cannot find a\nprivate person, this is what we do. We go look to the\nState law. And the Crider case says, basically, that when\nyou do that -- from the Fifth Circuit -- what you're doing\nis looking at the legal principles that are -- you're\nlooking at a factual situation that best articulates the\nState-law legal principles --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, doesn't that\napproach -- it doesn't make any sense, because you're only\nlooking at half of the equation. Presumably, if you have\na special set of principles for governmental actors, they\ninclude immunities and defenses and all that. And you\njust want the benefit of the liability, but you don't\nwant, I take it, the immunities and defenses that go along\nwith it.\nMR. COTTER: Well, that issue was actually\nraised in the Henzel case, in the D.C. circuit, where the\n-- there was a high-speed chase and the officer caused a\ncollision, and what happened was, the Government argued\nthat you can't apply the standard applicable defined duty\nof the Government, but you can apply the Government -- or\nthe D.C. regulations as to standard of care. And the D.C.\nCircuit found, no, it would follow Louie and Crider, and\nsay that the best predictor of the State law, when you\ncan't find an analogous private person, is the liability\nstatutes that concern the law enforcement, but, following\nIndian Towing, it would not apply the gross-negligence\nstandard that the D.C. Circuit had adopted that concerned\nthe officers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's actually a rather\ninteresting question I don't really know the answer to.\nThe idea is that you can't find an analogous private\nperson. We might have to write something about that. You\ncould say -- you -- there always is an analogous private\nperson. It's impossible to think of an example.\nThe other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit,\nwhich could -- which says as long as the Government was\ninvolved in regulation, there is no analogous private\nperson, because private people don't regulate. I would\nthink that was almost certainly wrong.\nBut what is the right way to go about it? Are\nthere such people, or aren't there?\nMR. COTTER: Well, Your Honor, what I would say\nin this case is, the absolute wrong way to go about it is\non a motion to dismiss, because, unfortunately, the record\nwasn't developed, which may, in fact, speak to issues that\nmay, in fact, address Arizona law on Good Samaritan, for\ninstance -- the issue of whether, under Arizona law, a\nduty was assumed, the issue of whether reliance exists.\nAnd I have to correct the Solicitor General.\nThe reliance does not merely come from the injured party.\nThe restatement section, section three- -- or the\nrestatement section 324 says reliance is from the other\nfor the injured party. So, in this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that make\nit a contract case? If you're talking about the party\nwho's contracted with, say, a private inspector -- I mean,\nI have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house\nfor termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job\nand the house is damaged, they're liable. But that's\nunder contract, and this is a question of tort liability.\nMR. COTTER: Well, if I may answer with a\nhypothetical, Your Honor, because we did not get to\ndevelop the record, what happened in this case is, the\nmine method changed. They went from taking the floor to\nthe taking the back. And they ripped out the ground\nsupport. So, people were working under unsupported ground.\nWe, because there was a motion to dismiss, never got the\nopportunity to take the mine operator and said, \"Why on\nEarth\" -- the deposition of the mine operator -- \"did you\nthink you could do this?\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What --\nMR. COTTER: \"Why on Earth did\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was your response to the\nmotion to dismiss? The Government said that you didn't\nraise, in response to the motion to dismiss, any assertion\nthat private individuals would be liable --\nMR. COTTER: Oh --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- under State law in this --\nin this situation.\nMR. COTTER: Justice Scalia, I did not\nunderstand the Government to be saying that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I -- that's how I\nunderstood it.\nMR. COTTER: -- and it is not true, if that was\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. COTTER: -- what they said.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was your response?\nMR. COTTER: Our response was that the law --\nfirst, our response was that, under the motion to dismiss,\nour factual allegations in the complaint have to be\naccepted, and we alleged all the elements of the Good\nSamaritan doctrine, and all the elements of the uniquely\ngovernmental --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said that? You said that,\n\"And we have a -- we have asserted all the elements of\nGood Samaritan\"?\nMR. COTTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. COTTER: And what happened was, frankly,\nJudge Browning dismissed, relying, I think, on the -- more\non the discretionary function exception, and then the\nMyers case, out of the Sixth Circuit, saying, as a matter\nof law, this -- as a matter of Federal law, MSHA is not an\nassumption of duty by the Government. And I don't know\nwhether this Court is inclined to address that issue or\nnot, but I'd just like to point out on that issue, the\nFederal Tort Claim Act makes the issue of whether the\nGovernment's liable a question of State law. The question\nis, as we have conceded, whether the mine inspector would\nbe liable if he were a private person, and -- which I\nthink goes to the prior question about, \"What if there is\nno\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we can remand for that.\nWhat's here is, the Ninth Circuit held that there's\nliability based on what the liability of a State agent\nwould be, and that's just not the rule.\nMR. COTTER: Well, Your Honor, if the Court is -\n-\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, we have to give some\ninstructions as to how the -- as to whether or not the\nNinth Circuit is right about that.\nMR. COTTER: If the Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's why you're here.\nMR. COTTER: -- if the Court is convinced that\nwhat the Ninth Circuit did was not try to predict what\nprivate law would -- that -- what private law in Arizona\nwould be, if the Federal mine inspector was a private\ncitizen, then we would concede that that's not the law.\nBut we believe that is what the Ninth Circuit did\nfollowing those cases -- the Louie case, the Crider case,\nand all of the cases that were --\nJUSTICE BREYER: See, that's exactly what's\nconcerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer.\nSuppose we do send it back because we think just what you\nsaid wasn't so is so, they have to now into this. They'll\nhave to go into it. Should we suggest, \"Look, you try\nharder to find a private analogy, because there's almost\nalways a private analogy.\" Every Government official has\nsome similarities to private people, and some differences.\nSo, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest, \"No,\nactually, there are quite a few differences.\" I don't\nhave much of a feeling for which way to go on that.\nMR. COTTER: Your Honor, if you do decide to\nremand -- which if the issue of the Good Samaritan\ndoctrine or assumption of duty under Arizona law is going\nto be addressed, we recommend that there is a remand -- we\nwould urge the Court, as a matter of first -- the first\nrule is to instruct the Ninth Circuit that these are badly\n-- these are cases that are badly decided on motions to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim. Because the Arizona\nlaw on when someone cites a -- adopts a duty -- the\nDaggett case or the Papastathis case -- are all fact-\nintensive.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that's not -- that's not\nwhat I've been asking.\nMR. COTTER: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And to expose everything I was\n-- perhaps the better thing is to say, \"There's always a\nprivate analogy,\" or try very hard, because if you really\nfound an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe\nthere would be no recovery, because the statute simply\nspeaks about private party.\nMR. COTTER: With all due respect, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And this is a statute designed\nto give people recovery --\nMR. COTTER: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- when people commit torts.\nMR. COTTER: It's a -- it's a statute where --\nwith a broad waiver intended. But I actually think if the\n-- if the rule were \"If there's no private analogy,\nthere's no recovery,\" it sort of reverses the statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it does, but that --\nwould we end up there, because of the way the statute's\nwritten? You avoid the whole matter if you say, \"Look for\nthe closest private person, no matter what.\" And maybe\nthat's --\nMR. COTTER: I concede that point, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, who's your -- what's your\nbest analog?\nMR. COTTER: My best analogy here is a private\nmine inspector who has the same duties as a Federal mine\ninspector, which, in this case, who -- you could say\nsomeone who contracted --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whom does he work for? Do\nmines hire these people, or does he work for the liability\ncarrier, which I would have expected? I mean, if we're\ngoing to make the kind of suggestion that Justice Breyer\nsays maybe we ought to make, we ought to have something in\nmind. And is it -- is it the -- is it an inspector who\nworks for the liability carrier who would be the closest\nanalog in your case?\nMR. COTTER: Well, earlier, the suggestion was\nmade, \"What happens if the Government\" -- I thought the\nsuggestion was, \"What if the Government outsources mine\ninspections? What if, instead of\" --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but this -- that's all\nhypothetical. You're litigating this case. You must have\nsomething in mind. Whom do you have in mind as your best\nanalog?\nMR. COTTER: The Arizona State mine inspector.\nThe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's your second-best analog?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. COTTER: Well, my second-best analog, I\nguess, would be a workers' comp carrier, an insurer, or --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But I thought you had assumed\nthat, under the Arizona law, you could rely on the Good\nSamaritan doctrine --\nMR. COTTER: I believe we can rely --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And I thought that, at least,\nwould be open on remand.\nMR. COTTER: I --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it necessary that we go\nfurther than that?\nMR. COTTER: Well, I don't think it's necessary,\nif the Court doesn't want to address whether the\nGovernment always needs to -- or the courts always need to\nfind a private person. The Good --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Aren't there, in all kinds of\nsituations, private inspectors? One of them that was\nmentioned in the briefs, I think, is an elevator operator.\nMR. COTTER: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Elevator operation inspector.\nSo, there's lots of private inspectors. There may not be\nprivate mine inspectors. I don't know about that. But\nthis would be inspector liability.\nMR. COTTER: Well, in the restatement, section\n324, under \"Assumption of a Duty,\" gives an example. And\nthe example is, if a private company hires a scaffolding\ninspector, and the scaffolding inspector does a negligent\ninspection, and a worker falls and is injured, the worker\nhas a claim against the scaffolding inspector. And then,\nunder the reliance component is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but only --\npresumably, only if they meet the requirements of the Good\nSamaritan law.\nMR. COTTER: I believe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- they would have\nto show that there was an increase in the risk of harm,\nwhich I think it would not be true in your hypothetical,\nor that there was a duty owed to the third party -- the\nscaffolding inspector is presumably hired by the\ncontractor, not by the employees -- or there was reliance.\nMR. COTTER: I think that that's true, Your\nHonor, although I'd like to read a quote from Papastathis,\nwhich is -- the court relied on. The quote is just this,\n\"Numerous cases have held that once a party gratuitously\nagrees to inspect and the third party is subsequently\ninjured, that party can be held liable for its negligent\ninspection.\" There is a host of Arizona case law on\nassumed duties. And the case I would refer to is Martinez\nversus State, which is simply a case where a road washes\nout, and the Government reroutes the road for a -- for a\nperiod of time across a private land, and, for a period of\ntime, grades it, and then stops grading it. And, in that\ncircumstance, the Government was held liable simply for\nhaving, for that period of the time, assumed a duty. And\nthere wasn't an analysis in the Martinez case of whether\nor not the elements of section 324(a) were met or not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we're just debating\nnow whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of\nthe Good Samaritan statute.\nMR. COTTER: Or whether there are alternative\ntheories of liability available under Arizona State law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you argue -- I mean,\nyou lost in the district court on the Good Samaritan\nstatute.\nMR. COTTER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On your appeal, did you\nargue that that was wrong?\nMR. COTTER: Yes. And the Ninth Circuit simply\ndidn't reach that issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said the district\ncourt went off on discretionary function?\nMR. COTTER: It went off primarily under\ndiscretionary function, but then in addressing the Arizona\n-- the Good Samaritan doctrine under Arizona, it relied on\nthe Myers case, which is a case in which -- the Sixth\nCircuit said that when you have the case -- or safety\ninspections like the Federal -- like MSHA, that court\nwould adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that\nthere could never be an assumption of duty under --\nbecause the Government was only in a monitor function.\nAnd, to the extent that that's at issue, Your Honor, I\nwould think that that would be a question, under State\nlaw, of whether the Government had assumed the duty. And\nif not under State law, it would be a question under the\nFederal Tort Claim of whether an -- there is an exception\nthat has been met. And there is no exception. I think\nthat this Court, in Berkovitz, said that regulatory\nconduct can be actionable under the Federal Tort Claim if\nit -- the discretion isn't met -- or the discretionary\nexception isn't met. And in this case there was an\nabsolute obligation to make these inspections and an\nabsolute failure to do so.\nMR. COTTER: Your Honor, if there are -- or the\nCourt -- if there's no further questions, I'd like to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cotter.\nMs. Maynard, you have five minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. MAYNARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I may just start where he ended. Just to be\nclear, Justice Scalia, the point that I was making is, the\nonly private-person law to which respondents pointed below\nwas that of the Good Samaritan doctrine. That -- whether\nor not respondents can make out a claim under the Good\nSamaritan doctrine would require meeting all of the\nelements of that doctrine. That would be primarily a\nState-law question, but we do think there's an ingredient\nof a Federal question there, especially, for example, in\ndeciding whether or not they reasonably and detrimentally\nrelied. Other courts of appeals, including the Sixth\nCircuit, in Myers and Raymer, have said that the language\nof the Mine Act is relevant to whether or not a party can\nsimply rely on the very -- just the bare existence of the\nMSHA -- of MSHA's existence and its inspections, and held\nthat, given the language in the Mine Act that expressly\nleaves the safety of the mine to the -- primarily to the\nmine operators through the assistance of the miners, that\nit would be unreasonable to rely.\nHere, it -- this was completely appropriately\ndecided by the district court on a motion to dismiss,\nbecause they came forward with affidavits that say nothing\nmore than that they relied upon the existence of the MSHA\nscheme. And that, under Arizona's Good Samaritan law in -\n- taking into account the Federal scheme, is insufficient,\nbecause it is insufficient under Arizona law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You consider affidavits\non a motion to dismiss?\nMS. MAYNARD: This is a 12(b)(1) and a 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, Mr. Chief Justice, because it's also a\njurisdictional issue, so it is possible. They came\nforward with these reliance affidavits, and I think it's\nsignificant how little they say. The reliance affidavits\nwould obviously not require any discovery on their part to\nindicate what their actions were, in terms of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what --\nMS. MAYNARD: -- upon which they were relying.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- what argument do you\nhave to avoid a remand for consideration of liability\nunder the Good Samaritan law?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think that's -- that's one of\nour arguments, that they can't meet the Good Samaritan law\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they didn't have a\nchance to argue that before the court of appeals, right?\nMS. MAYNARD: Oh, no, Your Honor, they argued\nthat before the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But court of appeals\ndidn't decide that.\nMS. MAYNARD: The court of appeals didn't decide\nthat. But, tellingly, I think, as Justice Breyer\nsuggested, the court of appeals -- and I think your\nquestion has suggested -- it seems that they think there\nis no liability there. The premise of the court of\nappeals' holding was that there is no private-party\nanalog.\nJustice Breyer, if there is no private-party\nanalog, if you conclude that this type of regulatory\nactivity has no private-party analog, the only appropriate\nanswer under the Federal Tort Claims Act is that the\nUnited States cannot be liable. You cannot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you think there is a\nprivate-party analog.\nMS. MAYNARD: We think that the Good Samaritan\ndoctrine affords an -- under this Court's interpretation,\nin Indian Towing, of the \"like circumstances\" doctrine, we\nthink one could look to the Good Samaritan principles,\nunder which we think we would prevail.\nIf I may, Justice Ginsburg, return --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Saying that there is no\nprivate-party analog is not quite the same thing as saying\nyou lose under what we consider to be the proper private-\nparty analog -- namely, Good Samaritan.\nMS. MAYNARD: We believe that once -- I'm not\nsure I get the vein of your question, but I'll -- the --\nif there is no private-party analog, so there's no\nprivate-person in like circumstances, the United States\ncannot be held liable. If there is a private-party in\nlike circumstances, one then must apply that law to the\nfacts and the claims and determine whether or not the United\nStates is liable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which the court of appeals\nhasn't done.\nMS. MAYNARD: But the district court did here,\nYour Honor, and held that we weren't liable. If the\nCourt's going to decide this on the record, we think the\nCourt can decide on this record that there could not be\nGood Samaritan law under Arizona law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we didn't bring cert\non that question.\nMS. MAYNARD: That was -- I think it's fairly\nencompassed. The -- it -- the question presented is\nwhether or not the court applied -- should have looked to\nprivate-person law. I think if you say yes, you could\nlook to that law and conclude on this record that there\ncan't be liability.\nJustice Ginsburg, if I may turn back to your\npoint about Muniz, I think you're correct that they didn't\nspecifically -- the court in that case didn't specifically\nsuggest what the private analog might be on remand,\nalthough it did suggest perhaps it would be personal-\ninjury law as it relates to private persons in like\ncircumstances. But I think the important point in Muniz\non that point is akin to what I was just making to Justice\nScalia, which is that the court said there is consent to\nsue here, so the prisoners may sue. Whether or not\nthey're going to be able to ultimately make out a claim\nunder private-person law is a different question.\nSo, the Federal Tort Claims Act is not a\nguarantee of monetary compensation from the United States.\nAnd one cannot do what the Ninth Circuit did, which is to\nkeep looking for possible analogies in -- under which the\nresult would be that the United States is held liable.\nSometimes, just like with private-party analogs, just like\nwith private safety inspectors, the answer will be: the\nprivate party can't be held liable under the applicable\nprivate-person law. And in -- the private-person law in\nArizona, I think it's clear, is the Good --\nI'm sorry. My Time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Maynard.\n"
