FAHRINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FAHRINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe urge that the appropriate rule for the\nresolution of ineffective assistance claims of counsel\nguaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution is best handled in a collateral proceeding in\nthe first instance, without first resorting to direct\nappeal and, if that claim might qualify for direct appeal,\nit should not be a procedural bar.\nQUESTION: What is the source of -- of law for\nour decision? Is it our supervisory powers, whatever we\nthink best, or --\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, certainly, Your Honor,\nthat is implicated, your supervisory powers. I also think\nthat under the Fifth Amendment, which has often been\nconstrued to contain the equivalent of equal protection of\nthe law, that this is a circumstance, with the division in\nthe circuit, that calls out for uniformity.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you're saying that if\nthere's a circuit different, there's a denial of equal\nprotection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment?\nMR. FAHRINGER: In this circumstance, Your\nHonor, and I'm not urging the Fourteenth Amendment. What\nI'm urging is, you have in the past had this circumstance\nwith, for instance, the Wade hearings, where it was deemed\nnecessary that you unify the system in the country so that\nthere is the equal protection, particularly in an area as\nimportant as criminal prosecution. Certainly, we would\nall agree that the -- the most important right a defendant\npossesses in a criminal proceeding is the right to\neffective assistance of counsel --\nQUESTION:\ncertiorari in cases, because we don't think one -- one\nrule should be -- obtained in New York and another rule in\nNew Orleans, but I don't think we ever thought it was the\nEqual Protection Clause that --\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, Your Honor, if -- if I've\noverstated, that I apologize, but certainly under your\nsupervisory powers, I think that this case calls for\nunity.\nQUESTION: We could unify it the way that you\ndon't want.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, I -- I appreciate that,\nYour Honor. I -- I would urge that it is -- it lends some\nforce to our argument up here that certainly a majority of\nthe circuits and the highest courts of 36 States have\nembraced the collateral review, and -- and the reason --\nQUESTION: Well, let -- would -- would it\never -- would the basis for an inadequate assistance of\ncounsel claim ever be apparent on the trial court record\nwithout resort to extrinsic evidence?\nMR. FAHRINGER: I don't think so, Your Honor. I\nthink that --\nQUESTION: Never?\nMR. FAHRINGER: -- it -- there may be one, one\nrare case, but -- as Judge Easterbrook in the Seventh\nCircuit said so eloquently, and that is that in the --\nbecause of the unique nature of the ineffective assistance\nof counsel, because of the relationship between the\nattorneys, and the -- and so much is a matter of omission\nand the confidential relationship that he stated in every\ncase there is something that you could do to add to the\nrecord that might reinforce the claim. The Second\nCircuit, most respectfully, Your Honor, has said that only\nin a very few cases would it be completely clear on the\nrecord.\nThe other reason that I think this rule is\nsuperior to the procedural default rule is that it would\nbring certitude to this area, where people would know with\nsome degree of confidence that it should be brought in a\ncollateral proceeding. It has the element of efficiency,\nin that it brings together in the 2255 proceeding all of\nthe ineffectiveness claims, so they can be resolved in an\nadversary hearing, which is certainly the best method of\nraising these claims, particularly when you need a full\nrecord.\nQUESTION: Is your position that it's 2255 only,\nor that it is the new counsel's option whether he thinks\nit's appropriate to raise the ineffective assistance claim\non direct appeal, or whether he thinks it's best to wait\nuntil the 2255 stage?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Or are you saying he can't bring it\nearlier, even if he thinks that --\nMR. FAHRINGER: No, Your Honor, I think it\nshould be an option. I don't think we can ever stop a\ndefendant from raising it on direct appeal if he makes\nthat choice. He -- he assumes the risk, then, most\nrespectfully, that he -- it -- it will be resolved,\nwhether he could have expanded the record or not, but\nmy -- my suggestion to the Court is, and I think logic\nsupports me in this respect, that with the 2255 collateral\navailable to him proceeding, that certainly the\noverwhelming majority of cases would be brought in that\nforum.\nQUESTION: But there's something to be said for\nwinding the thing up and getting it over with, isn't\nthere?\nMR. FAHRINGER: But those fears, Your Honor,\nthat were expressed in Frady, for example, have not been\npretty much put to rest by AEDPA, because now you have a\nstatute of limitation, so that these are not going to go\non and on. As a matter of fact, if you --\nQUESTION: If you -- if you have a choice\nbetween two proceedings and one proceeding, certainly\nthere's something to be said for one proceeding, although\nyour argument is that one proceeding simply isn't as\neffective as two, but I think you have to recognize that\nall things being equal, it would be better having one\nproceeding than two.\nMR. FAHRINGER: And -- and that one proceeding,\nYour Honor, I -- I understand with the exception of an\nindividual choice that one proceeding really should be the\n2255. What I might say, as an example to this Court,\nthink of the dilemma a defense lawyer faces in the Second\nCircuit where one, if he sees evidence of ineffectiveness\nbut it's not fully developed, and he doesn't raise it\nbecause he doesn't think he's obliged to, there's a risk\nof procedural default.\nIf he does raise it and it's not been fully\ndeveloped, it may be resolved by the court on a partial\nrecord, whereas if he'd been in a 2255 proceeding, he\ncould have expanded and amplified the record, which would\nhave strengthened the claim.\nThe third option is, that the Second Circuit\nseems to direct is, raise it at the earliest possible\nmoment, identify it, and then perhaps we will send it back\nfor remand. Well, that, that seems to just complicate the\nmatter.\nAnd then finally, Your Honor, I think one of the\nmost compelling arguments, which the Solicitor General\nagrees with, that this would put an end to needless\nexpenditure of judicial resources on resolving the -- the\ncause and prejudice rule. Remember, in a circuit like the\nSecond Circuit, every single man, woman that goes into a\n2255 proceeding because they have this direct appeal rule\nas an exception must establish cause and prejudice at the\nthreshold.\nQUESTION: Well, not -- not everyone. I -- I\nmean, only one who -- who got new counsel on the direct\nappeal.\nMR. FAHRINGER: That's right, Your Honor. I'm\nsorry. I'm speaking in the terms of that. Obviously, if\nyou had the same lawyer, that would -- Your Honor, that\nwould really be cause, so it may be that he would be able\nto easily overcome the cause aspect, but he still has the\nprejudice aspect that he has to establish.\nIn the other circuits, he can go right in on a\n2255, and -- and 2255 itself says that unless it's\nconclusively established that his -- his papers are\nwithout merit, a hearing shall be granted, so there's a\nterrible disparity in the way defendants are treated who\nare trying to -- to restore this most important right.\nQUESTION: Suppose you have a case where -- and\nyou stated earlier that this doesn't happen very often,\nbut suppose it's evident on the face of the record that\nthe counsel was ineffective.\nrecord, Your Honor, I wish the record to show I've been\nasleep for an hour during the key cross examination.\nIsn't it there also an efficiency in just\nsending it back for new trial right away, rather than\ngoing through all of the other claimed errors?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, Your Honor, I think yes.\nI --\nQUESTION: I mean, if it's evident that the case\nhas to go back, why have the district court -- or, pardon\nme, the appellate courts examine the entire record and --\nand give a lengthy opinion that's obviously going to be\nunnecessary?\nMR. FAHRINGER: And Your Honor, I hope I'm\nanswering your question, because I want to be direct. You\navoid that by the 2255 collateral review rule. Right now,\nthe Second Circuit is involved in a large number of cases\nwhere they come up and they just say, well, this really\nshould go back, and -- and that -- that prolongs the\nappellate process.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm a little confused on the\nsame point. I thought that, suppose -- does -- would you\nsay that a defendant is forbidden to raise an ineffective\nassistance claim on direct appeal?\nMR. FAHRINGER: No.\nQUESTION: No.\ndoesn't, you can -- he can raise it later in 2255.\nMR. FAHRINGER: That's right.\nQUESTION: And the appellate court can't say to\nhim, oh, you should have raised it earlier, so you're out?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Precisely, Your Honor. The --\nQUESTION: All right, and so all we're doing is\ndefining the -- the scope of the procedural bar rule when\na person goes into 2255. We're not controlling what he\nsays on his appeal.\nMR. FAHRINGER: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand --\nQUESTION: We're not.\nMR. FAHRINGER: -- it seems to me that if -- but\nplease understand, I think I have to say in all fairness,\nif he takes and goes up on the direct appeal with his\nineffectiveness claim and the appellate court resolves it,\nthen he may be barred.\nQUESTION: Yes, so -- so in other words, if he\nchooses to go and appeal, direct appeal --\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- he's not going to be able to make\nexactly the same claim later in 2255.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Precisely.\nQUESTION: But if he doesn't make it on direct\nappeal, you want him to be able to make it on 2255 and not\nbe met with the argument, oh, you should have brought it\non direct appeal.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, in response to that,\nthere really is --\nQUESTION: Yes, all right. I --\nMR. FAHRINGER: -- unanimity among all of the\ncircuits that the best forum -- the best -- the Second\nCircuit agrees with this, too. The best forum for\nresolving ineffectiveness claims is in the collateral\nproceeding, when you have access to discovery.\nQUESTION: May I ask you about this -- this\npossibility? Sometimes there are -- there are claims in\nwhich there are two bases for challenging the competence\nof counsel. Assume that one of them is plain on the face\nof the record, he didn't object to -- you have a whole\nbunch of, line of interrogation was plainly improper, and\nthe second ground is not plain on the record. Supposing\nhe raises the first ground on direct appeal and loses. Is\nhe barred, in your view, from raising the second ground on\ncollateral review?\nMR. FAHRINGER: No, Your Honor. He would be\nable to do that. The -- the -- but if I may, Your Honor,\nthat's triggered another grave concern here. In -- under\nStrickland you indicated that, you know, ineffectiveness\nclaims really should be judged in aggregate because one\nlends force to another. It ought to be the overall\nperformance of the attorney.\nWhat you have in the Second Circuit now is the\nvery piecemeal type of resolution of ineffectiveness\nclaims that you just described. What has actually\nhappened, and we cite the cases in our brief, they take\none because that's, they say is fully developed on the\nrecord. They resolve it. Two more go back down to the\n2255 proceeding, and that seems to be in direct defiance\nof the spirit, at least, of the Strickland rule that they\nshould all be decided together in one proceeding, and so\nthat, you know, it's -- the -- the powerful arguments of\nefficiency, simplicity, and fairness to all parties seems\nto -- to argue for the -- the collateral review rule.\nThe only argument they lean against this is this\nnotion of -- of finality, but -- but I submit to the Court\nmost respectfully that that's an -- that's in a -- an\nalmost nonexistent, narrow margin of cases, because\nthere's always more you're going to develop on the record.\nThe lawyer's explanation, for instance, you know, you\nnever have that --\nQUESTION: Well, you know, you could go -- you\ncould have an entire separate proceeding, Mr. Fahringer,\nand just have exhaustive discovery and so on, but there --\nthere comes a time when there is an interest in finality,\nthat you don't want the thing just postponed to another\nday, which this does.\nMR. FAHRINGER: But Your Honor -- and -- and I\nwelcome that question, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is\nthis, that if, as the Second Circuit itself says, it is\nonly in a very few cases where it would be fully developed\non the record, that seems to me to be a small price to pay\nfor a much simpler, more straightforward rule that\neverybody knows where they stand. Lawyers are not\nstruggling with this decision in the Second Circuit,\nshould I raise it, should I not raise it, am I at risk,\nand now what you've done is, under the Second Circuit's\nrule, you have spawned a whole generation of -- of second\nineffectiveness claims, because if the lawyer doesn't\nraise it and the defendant understandably says, well, you\nshould have raised it because they say it was fully\ndeveloped on the record and you thought it wasn't, now you\nhave another whole level that is added to this, so the\ncomplexity is staggering that is developed.\nQUESTION: Mr. Fahringer, is -- does AEDPA\nrequire that all such claims have to be brought within 1\nyear in any event?\nMR. FAHRINGER: It does to this respect, Your\nHonor, yes, because as a practical matter now, under AEDPA\nas it had amended 2255, if you bring an ineffectiveness\nclaim in a 2255 proceeding, and they are resolved, and you\nwant to try to bring another one, you have to get\npermission of the circuit court, of course, so you've got\nsome control over it, and -- and then all claims have to\nbe brought within a year in any event, so the fears that\nwere expressed in Frady have been put to rest, I believe,\nand there's really no good reason. I -- I think the\nreason the Solicitor General endorsed this rule for over\n20 years, and they've changed their mind now, but\ncertainly we've cited case after case where they argued to\nthis Court that -- that this is the best way to do it, to\nbring it in a collateral proceeding, because that is the\nfairest, the simplest.\nQUESTION: Am I right in thinking that most\ncases, even in the Second Circuit, do go into the 2255\nmold, because in most cases it will not be clear on the\nrecord, and the Second Circuit rule that you must bring it\non direct review applies only when it is clear, the\nineffectiveness is clear on the record, if you need to\nlook outside the record, then the Second Circuit agrees it\ndoesn't belong on direct review?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, in all due respect,\nI'm not sure that's right. Since Billy-Eko came down, 35\ncases that we were able to find in addition to this one\nwere defaulted, because the Second Circuit said it should\nhave been brought, there was enough on the record. So\nthis is a terribly ambiguous and controversial -- and we\ndon't know how many cases where district courts just\nsimply issued an order. These are written opinions, many\nof them, Your Honor, unpublished, but it --\nQUESTION: But there -- but are there not cases\nwhere the Second Circuit has recognized this particular\nclaim depends on extra-record material?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nAbsolutely. As a matter of fact, what I think lends force\nto our argument here is that even the Second Circuit\nacknowledged it, and yet they persist in holding to that\nnarrow exception that it should be raised on direct\nappeal, and that narrow exception means that in every 2255\nproceeding, a defendant must overcome what is a fairly --\na large hurdle of -- of cause and prejudice, and that's\nnot true in the other -- in the other circuits, so we\nbelieve, on balance, the better rule, and the one that\nwill more effectively administer justice, should be this\none.\nWith that being said, I'd like to close by just\nsimply urging the Court that since one of the most\ncherished policies of this Nation is that, and of the\ncriminal justice system is that a person is entitled to\nthe effective assistance of counsel, but if that right is\nrendered meaningless because if he's denied that\nsafeguard, he has no effective remedy to cure it, then it\nseems to me the right has been sadly lost, and I would ask\nthis Court to adopt the rule that we urge.\nThank you so much.\nQUESTION: Do you wish to reserve your remaining\ntime, Mr. Fahringer?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Yes. Mr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRIKANTH SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nQUESTION: Mr. Srinivasan, suppose you start by\ntelling us why the SG changed the position that it had --\nthat he had taken for so long on this point?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice O'Connor, the -- the\nSolicitor General's Office today, as before, believes that\nin the majority of the cases, in the overwhelming majority\nof the cases, claims asserting ineffective assistance of\ncounsel will be better resolved on collateral review. The\nquestion has been whether the costs of applying a\nprocedural default rule outweigh those benefits, and it\nhas been our experience, with the application of the rule\nin the Second and Seventh Circuits over the past several\nyears, that the administrative costs that initially were\nfeared haven't -- haven't been borne out, and that the\ndegree of uncertainty that initially led us to -- to reach\nthe position that a procedural default rule should not be\napplied hasn't been borne out either.\nQUESTION: So in effect you think that what's\nhappening now in CA-2 and CA-7 is just fine?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: In the main, we think that's\ncorrect, Justice O'Connor. It should not -- the rule's\noperation should not result in unfairness to defendants,\nand should not overload the courts with ineffectiveness\nclaims that are asserted prematurely on direct appeal.\nQUESTION: How many cases are we talking about?\nI mean, it's the -- we're arguing about a sub-class of\ncases in which counsel changes between the trial and the\ndirect appeal. Either in percentage terms or absolute\nterms, how many are we talking about?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, the best that\nwe can tell, and this is based on essentially anecdotal\nreports of U.S. Attorney's Offices, it's somewhere on the\norder of 20 to 40 percent, roughly, of cases in which new\ncounsel represents the defendant on appeal, but that --\nI'd -- I hesitate to rely too much on that figure, because\nit is based on the anecdotal reports --\nQUESTION: And --\nMR. SRINIVASAN:\nsignificantly by locality, depending on the particular\nrules that are in place for replacement of counsel on\nappeal.\nQUESTION: Within that 20 to 40 percent,\nwhatever it may be, do you have any kind of a rough guess\nas to the number of instances of this issue that arise?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: This issue?\nQUESTION: I mean, how -- how many times within\nthat 20 to 40 percent category do we get into an argument\nlater on as to whether 2255 can be availed of because, in\nfact, a -- a record was sufficiently developed to -- to\nraise the -- the claim on direct? How -- how many cases\nare there?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We don't -- we don't have the\nfigures on that. We don't -- we don't track the figures\nby substantive claims, and so it's been difficult to come\nup with numbers that reflect the treatment of\nineffectiveness claims in particular.\nQUESTION: So it's -- it's hard to say what the\nsort of cost to the system, if there is one, would be of\ngoing one way or the other?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's -- it's hard to say\nbecause there's no hard scientific data, and I --\nQUESTION: Well, how could there be? I mean,\nwhat the problem is, is in a very small number of cases,\nhardly any, you have a case in the district court where\nthe judge is serving as a habeas judge, and the Government\nin a very small number of cases comes in and makes the\nargument, judge, he cannot raise this ineffective\nassistance claim because he should have raised it on\ndirect appeal, although he didn't, and then the cost to\nthe system is hidden in the mind of the judge, in the\nminds of the lawyers who have to spend time briefing that\nand going and finding some affidavits, and trying to get\naround it.\nI mean, how could you get empirical information,\nand what led you to change your opinion? Have you been\ninvestigating the minds of the judge or the minds of the\nlawyers in some way, that you know that they aren't\nactually aggravated, that you know that they aren't\nactually disturbed at having to waste their time on such\nan issue?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, we haven't been conducting\nan examination of that, of that sort, of course.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sure you haven't. I'm being\na little facetious, but it seems to me it's not empirical\ndata. The world won't come to an end if you lose this\ncase. All it will do is save judges and lawyers a certain\namount of time, which, if you win this case, they will\nhave spent for no reason.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That -- Justice Breyer, it's\ncorrect that it saves time at the stage of collateral\nreview, but the question for procedural default purposes\nis the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal,\nand --\nQUESTION: You could save no time on direct\nappeal, it's nothing. I mean, what we're talking about is\ncases where the person didn't raise the argument on direct\nappeal.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But the consequences of having\na procedural default rule is that it encourages the\nraising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal in any\nessential issues.\nQUESTION: Yes, yes. Everybody will have to go\nand make the same argument twice. First they'll have to\ngo and make the argument on direct appeal, a lot of them,\nand then they will have to remake the argument on\ncollateral review, this time trying to explain why it's\nsomehow different.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer, there are\nsituations in which ineffectiveness claims can be raised\nand resolved on direct appeal, and --\nQUESTION: There are.\nQUESTION: Are there -- a fairly small number, I\nwould assume?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It is a narrow category of\ncases, Justice O'Connor, but those cases do exist.\nQUESTION: In any event, the AEDPA time limits\napply, do they not, even if we followed a different rule?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: As a -- that's correct, Justice\nO'Connor, the 1-year statute of limitations applies, but\nthat's also true of other substantive claims, and yet the\nCourt has continued to apply the cause in prejudice\nstandard to encourage the raising of those claims at the\nearliest available opportunity, and that's the -- that's\nthe principal policy interest behind applying the\nprocedural default rule in this context.\nQUESTION: Is this just a Federal question,\nMr. Srinivasan, or are -- does it carry over to cases\ngoing through State courts, too?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Mr. Chief Justice, the question\nbefore the Court is -- is purely a Federal question. The\nStates have adopted varying approaches, as we've suggested\nin our briefs. A significant number of States require the\nraising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and\njudge the raising of an ineffectiveness claim on\ncollateral review by a cause in prejudice standard.\nQUESTION: Isn't it true that the majority of\nStates go the other way?\nMR. SRINIVASAN:\nthe majority of States go the other way, but it's not\nentirely clear, Justice Stevens, because some of the\nStates haven't spoken directly on the question. What\nwe -- what we know is that 19 States -- it was 20 at the\ntime we filed our brief, but it's now 19, follow the cause\nin prejudice approach and require the raising of\nineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and there's at\nleast a significant number of States that don't require\nthe raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal,\nbut it's unclear whether there's more than 20, and so we\ndon't know exactly whether it's a majority or not, but --\nbut there at least are a significant number that apply\nprocedural default principles to the raising of claims on\ndirect appeal, and that's --\nQUESTION: Am I right that the Government's\nposition before the -- before we granted cert in this case\nwas, this lack of uniformity is all right, that either\nrule will do, and that lawyers, defense lawyers in the\nSecond Circuit will file the Second Circuit's rule, and\ndefense lawyers in the Fifth Circuit will file the Fifth\nCircuit rule, and that was okay? Wasn't that the\nGovernment's original position -- you were never saying,\nit must be direct review if it's clear on the record?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, our position\nwas that there was no need for national uniformity in the\nsense that the Court need not grant review to impose a\nnational -- national uniform rule. We didn't -- we\nthought that there was no unfairness in the existing\ndivergence of approaches among the courts of appeals,\nbecause in each court of appeals, a defendant had notice\nof the particular approach that applied in that circuit,\nand so a defendant knew ahead of time whether he had to\nraise its ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal, or\nwhether he could wait without penalty and raise it on\ncollateral review.\nQUESTION: So effectively, you told us not to\nbother with this case, but once we granted cert, then the\nGovernment had to take a position?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Correct, Justice Ginsburg. Now\nthat the Court has granted certiorari, we think it would\nbe appropriate for this Court to adopt a Nationwide rule\nsimilar to what the Court essentially did in Bousley,\nwhere the question was the proper time for raising an\nobjection to a guilty plea on grounds that the plea was\nnot voluntary, or -- or intelligent, and the Court reached\na resolution that required the raising of those claims on\ndirect appeal and adopted, it -- it appears, a Nationwide\nsolution, and we think a similar approach would be\nappropriate in this case, that the Court should decide\nwhether on a national scale ineffectiveness claims can\nalways be brought on collateral review without any\nconcerns about procedural default, or, as we think is\nappropriate, that ineffectiveness claims should be\nrequired to be raised on direct appeal in those situations\nin which counsel is new and the record -- the record for\nthe claim is fully developed in the trial record.\nQUESTION: One can imagine, if the requirement\nthat the counsel be new in order to force you to raise it\non direct appeal, that in itself could be the subject of\ncontroversy. That is, if you take a Public Defender\nOffice, and one Public Defender, one member of that office\nconducts the trial, and then another member of that office\nconducts the appeal, is that new counsel?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, there --\nthere are decisions that address that issue in the State\ncourts, and I believe at least a couple that address that\nissue in the Federal courts, and generally, the approach\nhas been that defenders from the same Public -- attorneys\nfrom the same Public Defender's Office are considered the\nsame attorney for purposes of conflict, determining\nwhether there's a conflict in one alleging that the other\nrendered ineffective assistance.\nAnd that, I think, comes from the ABA\nprofessional rules, and I -- and I believe it's Model Rule\n1.1, which suggests that competence is imputed to\nattorneys that operate within the same firm, and that\nconfirms that, at least for private firm purposes, two\nattorneys from the same firm would be considered to be the\nsame attorney for procedural default -- default purposes,\nand we think the same approach would follow with respect\nto Public Defender's Offices, so I don't think that the\nquestion of the same attorney is going to give rise to a\ngreat deal of litigation or uncertainty. The rules in\nthat area ought to be pretty clear.\nQUESTION: Well, there's one aspect of the\nGovernment's decision, now that it has to take a position\none way or another. These questions, ineffectiveness of\ncounsel, deal with what went on in the trial court, and\nordinarily, the first view of such questions is taken by a\ncourt of first instance, not an appellate court, and yet\nhere, the first look under the rule you are now supporting\nwould be taken by an appellate court.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncorrect, but I think it's important to point out that that\nquestion, that situation is going to arise regardless of\nhow this Court resolves the procedural default question,\nbecause in all the courts of appeals a defendant can raise\nan ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the procedure in\nthe -- in the Federal system for a collateral --\ncollateral action, they have a claim that's ineffective.\nDoes that go back to the judge who was the trial judge?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Typically, yes, that's the way\n2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: May I ask, under the Second Circuit\nrule, if the defendant is represented by the Public\nDefender's Office in the trial court, and then on appeal,\nthe Public Defender's Office continues to represent him\nbut by a different lawyer, they have different -- does\nthat -- is that a different lawyer within the meaning of\nthe Second Circuit rule, or is it the same lawyer?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I think as I was -- as I\nwas attempting to suggest in response to Justice\nGinsburg's question, I think that would be considered the\nsame attorney, and that follows from conflicts principles.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That attorneys within the same\noffice are considered to be the same attorney for purposes\nof conflicts, and that informs the proper approach in --\nin the procedural default inquiry, but I think it's\nimportant to note that all the courts of appeals are\nconfronted with ineffective assistance claims that are\nraised on direct appeal. No court of appeals prohibits\nthe assertion of an ineffectiveness claim on direct\nappeal, so in every court, the court of appeals is faced\nwith one of three options at the time an ineffectiveness\nclaim is raised.\nThey can deny the claim on the merits if they\ncan conclude that in no circumstances the claim could\nsucceed, they could grant relief on ineffectiveness\ngrounds in the narrow category of cases in which\nentitlement to relief will be apparent from the trial\nrecord, or they could decline to resolve the claim and\nremit its resolution to 2255, and that's precisely the\nsame three options that confront the Second Circuit and\nthe Seventh Circuit, who apply the procedural default\nrule.\nSo Justice Ginsburg, in response to your\nquestion, the courts of appeals are faced with the same\narray of options whether this Court adopts a procedural\ndefault principle or not, and in the Ninth Circuit, for\nexample, in 2001, the Court faced roughly on the order of\n50 direct appeals in which ineffective assistance of\ncounsel was asserted as a basis for relief, and in 10 of\nthose cases, the Court was able to decide conclusively\nthat the claim was lacking in merit and therefore couldn't\nbe brought again under 2255, and --\nQUESTION: Then the court of appeals can always\nsay, we think it would be better to have this aired in\nthe -- in the court of first instance, so there will be no\nprejudice to our rejecting it now, you can bring it in\n2255, but the one that -- the concern here is the\ndefendant and his new counsel, whether the new counsel can\nsafely say, if I have any doubt, I'm going to hold it back\nto the 2255, and one point that was made was that on\ndirect appeal, it's important for the appellate counsel to\nhave the cooperation of the trial lawyer to help him go\nthrough the record and point out possible grounds for\nappeal.\nBut if the new counsel is going to insert\nineffective assistance of counsel at that stage, it will\nmake the relationship between trial and appellate counsel\nrather tense, will it not?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That -- that possibility\ncertainly is there, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the same\npossibility arises at the time of collateral review, when\nthe attorney -- when you'd expect the attorney equally to\ndesire the cooperation of trial counsel, but any effort to\nassert ineffectiveness could create the same sort of\ntension in the relationship.\nQUESTION: Mr. Srinivasan, do you have any idea\nof what percentage of cases, of criminal convictions\nresult in inadequate assistance of counsel claims? Is it\n90 percent of them, 50 percent of them, what? Do we know?\nMR. SRINIVASAN:\nthat variety, Justice O'Connor. I think it's been\ngenerally recognized by several courts that ineffective\nassistance claims are often raised on collateral review,\nand I think it's fair to say that in a significant portion\nof -- of 2255 petitions, an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim will be at least one ground for relief.\nAnd one effect of applying a procedural default\nprinciple would be to encourage the raising and resolution\nof those claims on direct appeal in those situations in\nwhich it's appropriate, and I think it's important to\npoint out that there are at least some cases in which a\ncourt of appeals can resolve, on the basis of the trial\nrecord, that the -- that trial counsel either was or was\nnot ineffective, and this Court, for example, in its -- in\nits Kimmelman decision, the -- pointed out that trial\ncounsel's ineffectiveness, at least in terms of the\nperformance prong of the Strickland inquiry, was apparent\nfrom the trial record, and there will be situations like\nthat that arise every so often, and perhaps more\nfrequently an appellate court will be able to determine\nthat trial counsel's performance was not ineffective and\nwill be able to make that determination perhaps because,\nno matter how deficient the performance was, the -- the\nparticular matter at issue could never have resulted in\nprejudice for the defendant.\nFor example, if the claim of ineffectiveness is\nthat trial counsel was ineffective in failing to\ncompetently impeach a particular witness, an appellate\ncourt could perhaps look at the trial record and determine\nthat the testimony of that particular witness was not\ncentral to the prosecution's case, and in those\ncircumstances, could a more effective impeachment have\ngiven rise to a reasonable probability that the result at\ntrial would have been different.\nSo there are going to be some situations in\nwhich a court of appeals can resolve an ineffectiveness\nclaim at the time of direct appeal, and in those\nsituations, it seems appropriate to encourage the raising\nof the claim at that stage in order to promote respect for\nthe finality of criminal judgments and also to promote the\nresolution of legal claims at the earliest feasible\nopportunity.\nQUESTION: Under your rule, as I understand it,\nnew appellate counsel has the obligation to search through\nthe record to show, to find ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, and the trial counsel doesn't have that\nobligation. That, number one, seems to me a little bit\narbitrary and, secondly, I'm wondering if that might not\nitself have an effect on how often petitioner gets new\nappellate counsel as opposed to having his trial counsel.\nDo you think there might be some effect of this rule on\nthe decision to retain new counsel at the appellate stage?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We're not aware that --\nQUESTION: Or maybe even some gamesmanship\nplaying, where that trial counsel is counsel of record,\nbut he really gets new appellate counsel to help him out?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we're not aware of any --\nof any effect of that sort in either the Second or Seventh\nCircuits which apply the procedural default rule, and --\nand I think if trial counsel's involved in the\ngamesmanship, one would have to conceive of a situation in\nwhich trial counsel found it in his interest to ensure\nthat appellate counsel could confirm his ineffectiveness\nat trial, and that situation perhaps is unlikely to arise.\nAnd in terms of the distinction between\nappellate counsel calling into question trial counsel's\nineffectiveness, and trial counsel calling into question\nhis own ineffectiveness, Justice Kennedy, this Court in\nKimmelman observed what I think would -- is a common sense\nproposition, which is that trial counsel is unlikely to\nbring into question his own competence at trial and, in\nfact, he would -- he would create a conflict situation,\nand therefore the system just doesn't operate on the\nassumption that trial counsel should be required to\nidentify his own ineffectiveness and bring it to the\nattention of the trial court.\nQUESTION: What about Mr. Fahringer's point that\nif you follow your rule, you're going to get a second\ngeneration of ineffective assistance claims, that is, that\nthe counsel who didn't raise or did raise something on\nappeal was ineffective?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Mr. Chief Justice, it's true\nthat -- that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\nis -- would constitute cause for failing to raise the\nclaim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at -- on\ndirect appeal, that that is also true in -- with all other\nsubstantive claims, that ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel for failing to raise any substantive claim at the\ntime of direct appeal could constitute cause excusing the\ndefault, yet this Court has continued to apply procedural\ndefault principles in the case of other substantive\nclaims, and so I'm not sure that that particular\nconsideration tips the balance decidedly in one direction\nor the other.\nAnd in fact, the Court has made clear in\ndecisions such as Murray versus Carrier and Smith versus\nMurray, and -- and recently in Smith versus Robbins, that\nit's difficult to make out a claim of ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel because appellate\ncounsel's decision whether to raise a particular claim is\nthe hallmark of effective advocacy, and one would have to\nshow that appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to\npresent one claim instead of another at the time of\nappellate briefing in order to establish that there was\ncause for failing to raise ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel at the time of direct appeal.\nQUESTION: Of course, the Government loses one\nthing on -- on your theory in -- in certainly some of the\nineffective assistance records I've had here, or seen here\nwhere the -- the issue arises whether, in fact, an\napparently foolish move on the part of trial counsel was\ndictated by what ultimately was a very sensible tactical\nreason which is not apparent on the face of the record.\nIn cases like that, the Government isn't going\nto get a chance, in effect, to make that kind of rebuttal\nif the issue is raised on -- on direct. The Government\nsimply won't know.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, the Government\nwon't get that chance if it's resolved on direct appeal.\nIf it's raised on direct appeal, the Government, of\ncourse, shares an interest in assuring that the trial\ncourt -- that the appellate court, excuse me, does not\nresolve the claim because it would say --\nQUESTION: No, but you run the -- there's no\nquestion the -- but the -- the trial court may not give\nyou the chance. I mean, you run a risk that you're going\nto get cut short on your opportunity to get trial counsel\nto explain what may look like a very dumb thing on the --\non the record.\nThe risk you run is that the trial -- that\nthe -- that the appellate court on direct appeal is going\nto say, this was crazy, no -- you know, there -- there\ncouldn't be any sensible explanation for this, and I -- I\ndon't understand -- I don't know, just as we were saying\nbefore, there's no way to tell how -- how frequently a\nsituation like this will arise, because we don't have any\nhard statistics on any of it, but I -- I don't know why\nyou're giving that up.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, in order to ameliorate\nthat possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for\nexample, has adopted a standard under which it will not\ndecide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor\nunless there's no possible strategic rationale for\ncounsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that\nthere may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's\ndecision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring\nthat to the court's attention in its appellate briefing,\nand we haven't seen too many situations in which a court\ngrants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but\nyet there was potentially a strategic rationale for\ncounsel's decision.\nIn fact, the court should grant relief on\nineffectiveness grounds on direct appeal only in\nsituations such as the one that confronted the Court in\nKimmelman, where there was an extended dialogue between\ntrial counsel and the trial court concerning trial\ncounsel's assertively deficient decision --\nQUESTION: I --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- and trial counsel was able\nto explain to the trial court the basis of its decision,\nand from trial counsel's explanation, one could determine\nthat it wasn't based on a strategic rationale, but instead\nwas based simply on a misunderstanding of the time, of the\ntimeliness of the rejection rule that was at issue.\nQUESTION: In a collateral proceeding,\nMr. Srinivasan, you're developing evidence, you have\nthe trial -- you put the trial counsel on the stand and\nthe new counsel cross examines him to see -- prove how\nbadly he did?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That -- that could arise,\nMr. Chief Justice. That's -- that's one potential\nevidentiary way to show that trial counsel was\nineffective.\nQUESTION: And is there any limit on the -- can\nyou, you know, examine the trial counsel for his mental\nprocesses and that sort of thing?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm not -- I don't know the\nanswer to that, Mr. Chief Justice. I don't know to what\nextent privileges weigh into it.\nQUESTION: But the Government frequently in\nthese cases elicits testimony in response from the trial\ncounsel saying, well, yeah, I -- I didn't ask the question\nbecause I didn't want to get into this sort of subject, so\nI mean that --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- I take it, is a relatively common\nfeature in these cases.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Souter. It's in the Government -- the Government\ndoes do that, and it's in their interest to do that to\nensure that the result of trial is upheld.\nQUESTION: There are no privilege problems, are\nthere -- or maybe I'm wrong -- if -- if the client himself\nhas the new attorney examine the old one. He waives the\nprivilege.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think that's right, Justice\nKennedy.\nIf I could turn just for one moment to the\napplication of a procedural default rule to the facts of\nthis case, in -- if the procedural default rule were to be\napplied, the question at the time of collateral review is\nwhether -- is whether the defendant has introduced\nextrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in\nsupport of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of\nappeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic\nevidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness\nintroduced in the affidavits on which petitioner relies\nbecause the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the\ntrial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in\nfact did pursue.\nFor example, on the facts of this particular\ncase, that there was no blood spatter remaining from the\nwound, and that -- that no blood spatter reflected on the\nupholstery of the car, or no blood itself on the front\npassenger seat, or that the body of the -- the position of\nthe body wasn't consistent with the testimony concerning\nthe firing of the second shot, and I think it's important\nto point out that in all of those avenues were, in fact,\nexplored by the trial record -- excuse me, by trial\ncounsel, and were presented to the jury, and the jury\nevidently found them not persuasive.\nQUESTION: And yet the -- the trial judge\nherself said to defense counsel, aren't you going to move\nfor a continuance, when this bullet came -- was unearthed\nafter all that time.\nthat it would be -- might be a good idea for defense\ncounsel to seek a continuance?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: She did. She offered a\ncontinuance on repeated occasions to trial counsel, and\ntrial counsel turned it down, but I think the defendant's\nburden at the time of collateral review now is to show\nthat the refusal of a continuance worked to the\ndefendant's detriment and resulted in a reasonable\nprobability that the result at trial would have been\ndifferent had he -- had he accepted a continuance, and the\naffidavits only present avenues of inquiry that trial\ncounsel in fact pursued, which indicates, and I think in\nsome sense confirms, that a continuance would not have\naffected the result at trial.\nIf there are no further questions, Mr. Chief\nJustice --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.\nMr. Fahringer, you have 14 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD P. FAHRINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FAHRINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think\nI'm going to have to use them, but let me go right to this\nmatter of prejudice.\nThe Court should understand that the district\ncourt, nor the court of appeals, decided the prejudice\nissue. This was decided purely on procedural ground that\nthere was a sufficient record to raise it on appeal, and\nwhat I think it's important for you to understand is that\nalthough in the trial record you had the justice pleading\nwith defense counsel to take a continuance, investigate\nthis bullet that became the most important piece of\nevidence in the case -- the prosecutor stated that in the\nSecond Circuit, this was our most important piece of\nevidence. That became the pivotal point of the trial,\nand -- and the affidavits don't simply talk about avenues\nthe defense lawyer should have taken, what the affidavits\nsay is that it is highly unlikely that this bullet was\nfired in that car, and they say that it is not consistent\nwith the chief and one and only witness that was involved\nin the homicide, so what was missing, the indispensable\ncomponent for an ineffectiveness claim was the prejudice.\nThat was not on the record. What you had is, you're not\ntaking an adjournment, but all you have in the record is,\nthe bullet and the prosecution's proof.\nQUESTION: Of course, we're not trying to decide\nhere whether --\nMR. FAHRINGER: No.\nQUESTION: -- or not this claim should be\nsustained or rejected.\nMR. FAHRINGER:\nJustice, I agree. What I would like to say is, I think\nthe Solicitor General is mistaken when he responded to\nyour question and said that there would still be\nineffectiveness claims against appellate counsel. If this\nCourt adopts the rule that a ineffectiveness claim can be\nbrought under 2255 and does not have to be first explored\nin those few cases on direct appeal, then there certainly\ncan be no claim made against appellate counsel for not\nraising that claim.\nThe other issue that's been identified here,\nwhich is one of some moment, is new counsel. The -- the\nSecond Circuit has held in a case, it's unreported so I\nwon't discuss it, but you should know that there's a\nholding that the Legal Aid Society, when it went over to\nthe Appeals Bureau, that was a different lawyer, even\nthough it was the same society, so it -- it is -- there's\nambiguity there, too.\nWhat if the trial lawyer goes out and gets what\nhe thinks is a good appellate lawyer to come in Of Counsel\nwith him, and the new appellate lawyer comes in and he\nsees the colleague who brought him into the case has\ngot -- I mean, it just is generating one complexity after\nanother.\nIf you look at the Seventh Circuit rule, they\nhave put so many exceptions onto this, as has been\nidentified, that -- that it's just becoming I think\nunmanageable and the rule is becoming unadministratable,\nand for that reason it cries out for a new rule.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
