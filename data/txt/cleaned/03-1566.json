SMILAND: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe relevant language of the 1963 contract, as\nilluminated in the surrounding circumstances, was\nconfirmed in the express terms of the 1986 stipulated\njudgment which commanded the district and the United\nStates to perform the contract.\nIn particular, the first sentence of paragraph\n4.2, which is at joint appendix page 111, states -- and I\nquote -- the district acknowledges that it entered into\nthe 1963 contract for the benefit of Areas 1A and 1B.\nThat's the premerger -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Smiland, do you mind\ntelling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the\nCourt of Federal Claims?\nMR. SMILAND: Yes, Your Honor. There's a long\nhistory of litigation here. It began with the first suit\nin 1979. We were in the district court there. There were\nadministrative and constitutional and equitable issues as\nwell, and we were able in that initial case to combine all\nthose forms of relief in the district court. And then, of\ncourse, we got this judgment that I began to read from.\nAnd from then on, we had four or five other cases all in\nthe district court.\nWe do acknowledge that on the breach of\ncontract, there is concurrent jurisdiction under the\nTucker Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it concurrent? I mean, the\n-- the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent\nis given to join the United States as a necessary party\ndefendant. Is that what happened here? They were joined\nas a necessary party defendant?\nMR. SMILAND: Well, we think so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They were? I -- I think that's\n-- isn't that -- what rule of -- I thought there's a -- a\nRule of Federal Procedure. I can't remember what -\nwhat's the -\nMR. SMILAND: Rule 19(s)?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Is that what they were\njoined under?\nMR. SMILAND: That -- that procedure was not\ninvoked here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Well, all right. Were\nthey -- there's technical phrase well known in the law to\nbe joined as a necessary party defendant. Given the\nnormal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is\nthat what happened here?\nMR. SMILAND: No. What happened -- what\nhappened -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, okay. If it did not\nhappen, then how could you possibly sue in that court\nrather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you\ncan sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?\nMR. SMILAND: Because the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity statute says in any suit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't mean in any suit in\nsentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1? Does it\nmean any suit in the universe? Any suit in the world?\nAny tort suit? I would have thought that sentence 2\nrefers to sentence 1.\nMR. SMILAND: Well, it -- it does and that case\nwas litigated against the United States by my clients and\n-- and we won in the Peck case. And we think that should\nhave ended the matter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But don't -- how can we, if we\nhave -- if -- if I read this -- this as meaning\ntechnically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter,\nhow could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of\nClaims, you're in the wrong court?\nMR. SMILAND: Any suit is also in the first\nsentence, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. It says -\nMR. SMILAND: And -- and -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in any suit you can join the\nUnited States as a necessary party.\nMR. SMILAND: The -- the -- in the sue and be\nsued cases, this Court construes that very broadly, and\nthis is the same root word and -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but we don't give broad\nconstruction to waivers of sovereign immunity.\nMR. SMILAND: I -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Quite the reverse. And it\nsays to join the U.S. as a necessary party defendant in a\nsuit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the\ncontractual rights of a contracting entity in the United\nStates regarding any contract executed pursuant.\nNow, I guess the farmers were not technically\nthe contracting entity.\nMR. SMILAND: They were not the signing -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No.\nMR. SMILAND: -- party.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So you've got more problems.\nMR. SMILAND: Our -- our argument -- and again,\nthis has been resolved in the lower courts against the\nGovernment. But our -- our view is that by the nature of\nthe intended beneficiary doctrine, the duty is owed to the\nthird party, as well as to the promisee, and it's\nenforceable by the third party, as well as the promisee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- if the lower courts\nwere of this view, why did the district court in this case\ngive you three opportunities to have your contract claim\ntransferred to the Claims Court?\nMR. SMILAND: Once the determination was made\nthat we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that\nwas the law of the case, and had it been transferred to\nthe Claims Court, we -- we would have been bound by that\ndetermination. We felt we had to bring to a final\nresolution the -- the intended beneficiary issue before we\ncould proceed in the Claims Court either.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does suggest that the\ndistrict court had at least some concern whether the case\n-- your claim had been lodged in the right court.\nMR. SMILAND: Yes, although again that -- that\ncourt had been hearing these matters for many years in -\nin numerous cases without this issue ever having come up.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but it's a -- see, I want\nto know what I'm supposed to do. As I read the language,\nyou're out. As I understand the purpose of the statute,\nit makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make\nsense to me if you're in. And maybe there's some lower\ncourt precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read,\nbut is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary\nthat supports you?\nMR. SMILAND: Just the -- the language of in any\nsuit definitely is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But that isn't the\nlimiting part. The limiting part is in any suit of a\ncertain kind.\nMR. SMILAND: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they give consent to is\njoinder as a necessary party. And that is not what\nhappened here.\nMR. SMILAND: Only the -- the general principle\nthat language should be read in its ordinary meaning -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's ordinary meaning, you're\nout because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary\nparty is you weren't joined as a -\nMR. SMILAND: There -- there at least is no\nevidence that Congress had rule 19 in mind when it enacted\neither the '52 statute or the '82 statute that we -- we\nstand on.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's something that I\nhadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that,\nwell, if you're transferred to the Court -- to the Court\nof Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous\nrulings of the United States district court in California\nand that those are somehow binding because of the law of\nthe case -- what is the authority for that? The -- the\ncourt that's transferred has to accept all the rulings\nthat have been made previous to the transfer?\nMR. SMILAND: I -- our understanding is if,\nobviously -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, what's the authority\nfor that?\nMR. SMILAND: I can't cite you authority, Your\nHonor, but I -- we were very concerned about that. If\nthere was no waiver of sovereign immunity in the first\ninstance, then the lower court's ruling on intended third\nparty beneficiary I would think should be vacated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- I -- I guess I'm not\nfollowing this. I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you -- you\nhave not referred to the last sentence of -- of what you\nassert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says\nany suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any\nUnited States district court in the State in which the\nland involved is situated. Why isn't that what you're\nrelying on?\nMR. SMILAND: It is and -- and when I was\ntalking about in any suit -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does that help you?\nBecause it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of\ncourse, this section starts off by talking about addition\nof a person as a necessary party. So how does the last\nsentence help you?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I --\nMR. SMILAND: Well, it -- it -- if the words,\njoin necessary, limit any suit and the language that\nJustice Scalia referred to, then -- then maybe we're in\ntrouble. But otherwise -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I take that to mean that\nwhen you sue one defendant and you also sue the United\nStates as a necessary party defendant, that suit -- any -\nthat would be a suit pursuant to this section. I -- I\ndon't know what other meaning that -- that sentence could\nhave. When you sue two parties, one of whom is the United\nStates, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party\ndefendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and\nit can be brought in any United States district court in\nthe State in which the land involved is situated. I -- I\ndon't know what -- what other suit that -- that sentence\ncould refer to.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You -- you agree with that. I\n-- you're caught in between us here, and I understand.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I guess we have to figure\nout what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps you can explain.\nThis was not your suit originally. You intervened.\nRight? This was started out by the water district.\nMR. SMILAND: The district sued the United\nStates. We intervened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then after some, I think,\n2 years -\nMR. SMILAND: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the water district bows\nout. It has settled its case. It's a mystery what it\nsettled for. At least, I didn't see it in any of the\nbriefs. Why did the water district, having brought this\ncase, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?\nMR. SMILAND: The record is very sparse, Your\nHonor. There is the district's motion which says pretty\nmuch what it said in its brief, that there was a -- a\nthing called the principles between it and the United\nStates and various parties. And as a result of those\nprinciples, which are not in the record, although they are\na matter of public record, the -- the district in its\ndiscretion elected to dismiss the case. We opposed that.\nWe would have hoped the district would have kept going.\nWe lost that opposition. The district was dismissed, and\nwe were allowed to proceed on our own.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Smiland, can I ask this\nquestion? If Justice Breyer is -- the thrust of his\nquestion is right, I -- I think the district itself could\nnot have brought the suit under his reading of the\nsovereign immunity. And I'm just wondering, has the\nUnited States ever taken the position that the district\ncould not have initiated this litigation?\nMR. SMILAND: Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- could we hear your\nargument on -- on the sovereign immunity point as opposed\nto the venue point? What -- on what ground do you say the\nUnited States has waived its -- its immunity from suit in\nthis case?\nMR. SMILAND: There are two statutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may we just back up to\nthe question -- your answer to Justice Stevens? I thought\nthat this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water\ndistrict for money damages. I thought they were seeking\ndeclaratory relief against the United States.\nMR. SMILAND: They pled both, Your Honor.\nAlthough at that time the water still was available for\ndelivery, it hadn't flowed to the ocean. And the money\nhad not yet been collected and spent. So the focus\ninitially was on equitable relief to stop -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because one could -- one\ncould read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm,\nvalidate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for\ndeclaratory relief but not encompassing damages.\nMR. SMILAND: Both statutes we cite say that\njudgments can be entered in the same manner, to the same\nextent as a private individual under like circumstances,\nlanguage I believe from the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nAgain, both in the 491 F.Supp. decision under the McCarran\nAct and in the Peck case, the district court held that\nmoney damages were encompassed by that. So both statute\n-- statutes on which we rely have language in it taken\nfrom other sources of law, with which this Court is very\nfamiliar and has opined on several times.\nThe -- the only unique parts of -- of either of\nthe two statutes that we stand on are -- are the rights.\nOne refers to administering a previously adjudicated right\nto the use of water, and the other is the contract\nlanguage we've discussed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you turn to sovereign\nimmunity now?\nMR. SMILAND: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and let me make -- make\nit easy for you. Do you know of any case, other than\ncases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a\nsuit has been allowed against the United States based on\nnothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary\nof a contract to which the United States has -- on which\nthe United States has agreed to be sued? Is -- is there\nany such case?\nMR. SMILAND: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you think it's clear\nthat -- as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such\na third party beneficiary can sue the United States?\nMR. SMILAND: For example, in the U.S. v.\nDistrict Court case decided by this Court in 1971, under\nthe McCarran Act, that fact situation was not before you,\nbut the Court did say that the rights to which the statute\nreferred were all inclusive. It read it broadly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't understand that.\nThe rights were all inclusive.\nAs -- as I understand the law of third party\nbeneficiaries, it -- it used to be -- and -- and perhaps\nat the time this statute was enacted still was -- quite -\nquite restrictive. It's only in more recent -- I don't\nagree with the Government's argument that -- that you have\nto, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third\nparty beneficiary's rights. But when sovereign immunity\nis at issue, it's -- it's a different question, it seems\nto me.\nMR. SMILAND: Well, we have explicit rights here\nand -- and it would seem to me that if -- if -- and this\nwas certainly the legislative history behind section 221,\nnot -- not behind McCarran. But if -- if the same duty is\nowed by the promisor to the third party that it owes to\nthe promisee, and if the third party has the same rights\nof enforcement as it does under 304 of the Restatement\nthat the promisee would have, why should it be any\ndifferent? Why would Congress have intended to exclude\nthat? And it used the word contract.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because -- because we have a\nrule that says when Congress wants the United States to be\nsued, it -- it must say so clearly.\nMR. SMILAND: You also have the rule that the\nword contract means the law of contract and not parts of\nit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But yes, isn't it arguable,\nthough, that in this case the Government probably thought\nthat it would be efficient to have the district represent\nall the farmers for whatever their -- to the extent their\ninterests were shared with one another, rather than having\nevery individual have the same right to bring -- bring a\nlawsuit?\nMR. SMILAND: Efficient in -- in collecting land\nassessments and water charges, but there's no evidence in\nthe -- either the language of the statute, I submit, or\nthe -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Except for the fact that the\ndistrict is the party to the contract, though.\nMR. SMILAND: Nothing was said about litigation,\nlet alone intended third party beneficiary -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the -- the whole\npoint of the district -- correct if I'm wrong. This is\nyour area. The whole point of the district was to make it\neasier for the United States to know with whom it was\ndealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well,\nthat doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me\nthat destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the\ndistrict.\nMR. SMILAND: There's a lot of legislative\nhistory there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, Your\nHonor, about efficiency and -- and the convenience. But\nit's not talking at all about litigation, about remedies,\nabout rights once there's a breach.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't really achieved\nvery much efficiency if you simply get the United States\nout of the business of collecting the payments and of\nkeeping track of the payments but leave the United States\nsubject to suit when the person who has authority to do -\ndo these things goofs. I mean, what -- what trouble has\nthe United States saved itself? It would still have to\nride herd over -- over the person with -- with whom it's\ndealing.\nMR. SMILAND: Well, it -- this is a transaction\nbetween a water seller and many water buyers. Yes, in\n1926 districts were put in the middle, but it's also true\nin 1939 in -- in the section 9(e), Congress authorized the\nparticular type of contracts we have here, so-called water\nservice contracts, and it doesn't mention district. And\nas a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has held that the\nbureau had the discretion administratively to deal with\nindividuals.\nSo throughout the history of the reclamation\nprogram, you -- you have the -- the core transaction is -\nis a water sale from the Government to -- to farmers. And\nthat's was the case on day one in 1902 and it still is.\nAnd I'd just like to remind the Court that\nparagraph 3 of the stipulated judgment at page 110 of the\njoint appendix is in our view dispositive here. This was\na -- an agreement by the United States and the district,\napproved by a court after formal settlement notice was\ndispatched to two formal classes, and it says, any\nappropriate relief may be obtained against the Federal\nparties by the filing of a new action for violation of any\ncontract arising independently of this judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the -- the Justice\nDepartment has no authority to -- to consent to suit which\n-- which Congress has not consented to. I don't see how\nthis strengthens your case.\nMR. SMILAND: Again, if -- if this Court should\nhold that neither of the two statutes on -- on which we\nstand waive sovereign immunity, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this alone wouldn't -\nwouldn't remedy the -\nMR. SMILAND: Then -- then -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the absence -\nMR. SMILAND: -- the decision that we're not\nintended beneficiaries should be vacated and we should\nhave a chance to go to the court -- Claims Court.\nI'd like to reserve, Your Honor, 3 minutes, if I\nmay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may, indeed, Mr. Smiland.\nMr. Minear, I think you're up next.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nMR. MINEAR: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nPetitioners cannot maintain this suit for breach\nof the Westlands contract because the Westlands contract\nis itself subject to the rules of sovereign immunity. And\nsection 390uu authorizes only a limited waiver of\nsovereign immunity. It does not authorize suits by\nincidental beneficiaries for money damages.\nFor many of the points that have already been\nraised by Justice Breyer, Justice Kennedy -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Minear, do you think it\ndoes waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the\ndistrict?\nMR. MINEAR: In one circumstance, Your Honor.\nThis suit allows a district that has been sued by\nindividual water users to join the United States in the\nongoing suit and, in fact, remove the case to Federal\ncourt if necessary, so there can be a determination of all\nthe rights in those -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did this suit begin as a suit\nby a water user against the district and then you were\njoined later? Is that --\nMR. MINEAR: No, it did not, but that did occur\nin the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation that ran between\n1978 and 1980.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in this suit, did not\nthe district bring it against the United States?\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And was that a -- was that\njurisdiction proper at that time?\nMR. MINEAR: That suit was brought under the\nAPA, and the district brought the suit on that basis.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But was it properly brought is\nwhat I'm asking you.\nMR. MINEAR: That suit was properly brought.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMR. MINEAR: But it was not brought under 390uu.\nInstead, there was an allegation that the United States\nhad acted unlawfully and the Westlands relied on the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And no money damages.\nMR. MINEAR: And no money damages as well, and\nthat's what distinguishes this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that -- so your view -- I\nmean, what -- what makes sense to me is that the section\nmeans what it says, that consent is given to join the\nUnited States. That means join them in an ongoing suit.\nAnd it makes sense because what the United States wants is\nanyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court\nof Claims. But of course, where you have an ongoing suit\nbetween two other people, we'll make an exception because\nthere it's already in another district and we'll let you\nbring the United States in as a necessary party. The\nother exception is when you don't sue for money damages.\nThat's in section 702 of the APA.\nNow, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's\nconsistent with the language. Is that your view or do you\nhave a different view?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, that is our view, and let me\nsupplement your comments in this regard. Section -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I -- may I -- has that\nalways been your view throughout?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MINEAR: It has been our view under 390uu\nwhen section 390uu has been -- has been raised.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But throughout the litigation?\nMR. MINEAR: Throughout this litigation? I\ncan't -- I can't be sure that we've maintained a\nconsistent position, but ultimately this is a question of\nsovereign immunity. So the importance is that we get the\nissue right here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There has to be an ongoing\nsuit. You think this section does -- does not permit\nsomebody to initiate suit against one party and at the\nsame time against the United States as a necessary party.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, let me explain why\nthat's the case, and there was an answer -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why what is the case?\nMR. MINEAR: Why there's a necessity for an\nongoing suit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- that is to say, there's\na suit between only two individuals and then the United\nStates is brought in.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, this -- this provision\nwas enacted in response to a specific problem that's\nillustrated by the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation.\nIndividual farmers sued an irrigation district. The\nirrigation district was concerned that it might be subject\nto inconsistent liability to the farmers on the one hand\nand the Federal Government on the other, and it sought to\njoin the United States. There was no mechanism in 1978\nfor that type of suit. Congress acted -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. That's one\nsituation that this provision could cover, but there are\nother situations that this provision could -- could cover.\nLet's say a farmer wants to bring suit against the\ndistrict, but it doesn't really know whether the fault is\nwith the district or whether the district was -- was\ncompelled to do what it did by the United States. So it\nsues the district and just in case the United States was\n-- was responsible, it joins the United States. Why\ndoesn't the language entirely permit that kind of a suit?\nMR. MINEAR: The language could be construed to\nallow that, but -- but waivers of sovereign immunity are\nconstrued narrowly, and the language I think is more\nproperly construed, as Justice Breyer has suggested, to\nallow joinder as a necessary party. And in fact, it was\nenacted in specific reaction to that problem in the\nBarcellos & Wolfsen litigation where we did have ongoing\nlitigation and there was a sense by the irrigation\ndistrict they needed to join the United States so they\nwould not be subject to inconsistent suits.\nSo although I think that the language can bear\nthe -- the interpretation that you're suggesting, Justice\nScalia, nevertheless, I think the better interpretation is\nthe more narrow one that is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then -- then how do you explain\nthe last -- the last sentence of that provision, which is\nany suit pursuant to this section? The only suit that the\nsection refers to is a suit in which the United States is\njoined as a necessary party defendant. That's the subject\nof the section.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the last sentence\nsays, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in\nany United States district court. And I read that to mean\nif you want to sue the United States as a necessary party\ninitiating a suit, you can bring it in -- in any district\ncourt in which the land involved is.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, we read that as\nallowing removal in those circumstances when the United\nStates is joined later.\nIn any event, I have to say that with regard to\n-- to this disagreement, it does -- it's not dispositive\nor even affect the case here. The fact is that this\nwaiver of sovereign immunity under no circumstances would\nallow this suit to go forward. Apart from the money\ndamages aspect, which itself is -- is -- would preclude\nthis type of suit, these parties are not intended\nbeneficiaries, and without being intended beneficiaries,\nthere's -- in no circumstances could they ever evoke these\nprovisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Minear, when you say -\nwhen you say not money damages, do you read the words that\nI read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they\naccommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate,\nconfirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a\ncontracting entity?\nMR. MINEAR: We think that under your cases,\nsuch as Pena v. Lane, there needs to be a specific\nreference to money damages. This simply is referencing\ndeclaratory relief, and so we do not believe it would\nallow an award of money damages. Rather, the party must\ngo to the Claims Court if they're seeking money damages.\nAnd in fact, the waiver of sovereign immunity\nthere is somewhat broader. It does, as mentioned before,\nallow implied or express contracts. So this suit is\nsimply in the wrong court.\nBut I would like to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So money damages -- waiver\nalways used the word money damages. When it says\nadjudicate the rights under the contract, that doesn't\ninclude money damages?\nMR. MINEAR: No, I do not think in this context\nit would. I think there needs to be something more\nspecific. We're really talking about declaring rights\nhere and not providing a specific remedy. And this Court\nhas always taken the view that the Claims Court\njurisdiction is the appropriate forum for deciding money\ndamages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the second sentence?\nThe United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have\nwaived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto\nby reason of its sovereignty and shall be subject to\njudgments, orders, and decrees of the court having\njurisdiction and may obtain review thereof in the same\nmanner and to the same extent? It's subject to the\njudgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same\nextent as a private individual under like circumstances.\nWhy isn't that enough to -- to say that the court can -\ncan award damages?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I think that simply\nrefers back to the previous sentence, which refers to\nadjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree. Now, if you\ninterpret that to include money damages, then the second\nsentence would follow, but I -- I think the two have to be\nconstrued together. And in our view simply allowing a\nparty to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree in these\ncircumstances would not allow award of money damages.\nCertainly I think Congress would be much clearer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but if contractual rights\ninclude a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you\nget a money judgment in a case like that? That first\nsentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual\nright to be paid something.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, again, waivers of\nsovereign immunity are construed narrowly. Now, let's -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's pretty clear language.\nMR. MINEAR: -- I have to say that the language\n-- you're saying that the language -- yes, could it\nconceivably be -- be interpreted in -- on -- that broadly.\nBut that's not -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Certainly if it were not a -\na United States and were a private individual, it would\ninclude money damages.\nMR. MINEAR: That might well be, but this is -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and the next sentence,\nas Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall\nbe treated just like a private party.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. But Your Honor, ultimately I\nthink that we have to focus on that this is a waiver of\nsovereign immunity. And -- and so far we have not touched\non the question of whether these parties -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I think you've got a\nvery strong argument when you talk about an incidental\nthird party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but\nnow you're asking for a much broader holding than really\nnecessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I think I started with\nthat point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke\nthis -- this provision. And I'd like to -- to continue\nwith that point because the party here is merely an\nincidental beneficiary and not an intended beneficiary.\nUnder any of the -- the tests that have been applied for\nthird party beneficiaries, the party here would not\nqualify as an intended beneficiary.\nMost importantly, the contracting parties here,\nthe United States and Westlands, expressed no intent to\ngive this party enforcement rights.\nWhat's more, the contract does not provide that\nperformance would be rendered to -- to the petitioners in\nthis case. The contract is quite clear that performance\nis rendered to Westlands. This is a contract in which the\nUnited States furnishes a specified amount of water to\nWestlands and Westlands pays money for it. Westlands then\nhas a separate obligation with regard to the farmers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Separate from -- where does\nthat -- that obligation come from?\nMR. MINEAR: That arises from the regulations\nthat the Westlands Water District has enacted that\nprovides for the delivery of water from Westlands to the\nindividual farmers. The United States' obligation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a State -- a State\ncreated obligation?\nMR. MINEAR: That's right. That is -- and\nWestlands has the -- has the option of either engaging in\ncontracts with the individual farmers or distributing the\nwater through regulation, and it has opted for\nregulations.\nNow, Westlands itself is a governmental unit.\nIt is comprised of the -- of the very farmers here, among\nothers, who have brought this suit. And it has the\nauthority to act in a representative capacity on behalf of\nall its members. And that is why the United States enters\ninto contracts with irrigation districts precisely because\nit allows them to reach accord and agreement and to\nresolve their disputes. Now, the fact is that the United\nStates and Westlands agree on a great many things.\nSometimes they disagree, but when we disagree, we're able\nto -- to speak to one another as two governments\nrepresenting constituencies and hammer out our\ndifferences. And that would be impossible if these types\nof third party beneficiary suits were allowed.\nAnd I think that goes to the crux of what the\nUnited States' real concern here is. When there are\ncontracts between one government and another, just as in\nthe context of treaties or compacts among the States, it's\nvital that the two governmental units be able to deal with\none another as governments and to be assured that if they\ncan reach accord on behalf of their representatives -- on\nbehalf of the parties they represent, that that will\nresolve the issue. If it were otherwise, this type of\ndistribution of water -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you don't take the\nposition, do you, that Westlands could have agreed with\nthe United States that it wouldn't enforce its new laws\nthat deprived the farmers of water? You don't take that\nposition.\nMR. MINEAR: But let's look at what would\nhappen, Your Honor, if that did happen. The individual\nfarmers would sue Westlands, claiming that Westlands was\nnot living up to its contract obligations. Westlands\nwould invoke 390uu and join the United States in that\nsuit. And the question of the legal rights would be\ndetermined on that basis. So the mechanism that -- that\nwe've specified and the way that we interpret it deals\nprecisely with the problem that you've -- you've\naddressed.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but you can't -- the -\npresumably the Federal Government can't negotiate away the\nEndangered Species Act or something. The fact is that new\nlaws were passed after these contracts were entered into\nwith Westlands. Isn't that right?\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. And again, I think\nit's instructive to see what happened in this case. When\nthose laws were enacted, the United States reacted to\nthose. Westlands brought a suit under the APA challenging\nthe interpretation of the statutes. Westlands was\nentitled to do that under the APA. The United States and\nWestlands reached an accord, together with the\nenvironmental intervenors in this group, that was\nsatisfactory to those parties. And it simply would be\nvery disruptive of the system if a minority of farmers in\nthe Westlands District could then bring a suit and upset\nthat agreement and that accord that had been reached.\nFinally, I'd like to make a brief -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can the district get damages\nfrom the Government?\nMR. MINEAR: Technically yes, but their damages\nare limited by the terms of the contract. Westlands could\nsue the United States in Claims Court for a breach of the\ncontract, but the contract itself says that any damages\nthat are -- that the sole liability of the United States\nin these circumstances would be an adjustment of the\naccount. In other words, there are not consequential\ndamages. Rather, if we do not provide Westlands with the\nwater that Westlands believes it's entitled to, then we\nstand liable for an adjustment in the payments that\nWestlands would make to us.\nThe suit that is being brought here is asking\nfor consequential damages, and we believe that the\ncontract here does not allow consequential damages. That,\nof course, is a merits question that there's no need for\nthe Court to reach, but that is the way it would be\nresolved in Claims Court in -- in our view.\nI'd like to also raise the question of property\nrights since that has -- has come up, that one of the\narguments that has been made by Westlands is that they're\nentitled to status of a third party beneficiary because\nthey claim they have water rights in these circumstances.\nThe fact is that the United States, the State of\nCalifornia, and Westlands, as well as the California Water\nResources Board and the first tier of California courts,\nhave all concluded they do not have the -- the water\nrights that they claim. But in any event, our view is\nthat that issue is irrelevant to the inquiry here.\nRather, the question of third party beneficiary\nstatus turns on the intent of the contracting parties.\nDid they or did they not intend to give enforceable rights\nto the third party? Here there's not a shred of evidence\nthat that was an intent -- there was an intent to create\nenforceable rights in that third party.\nQuite to the contrary. The only reference of\nthird parties, the farmers, in the contract here is\ndirected to limitations on what the district can do once\nit receives its water. It doesn't create rights in them\n-- the individual farmers. Quite to the contrary. What\nit does it restricts the ability of the district in order\nto protect the United States' interests, to make sure the\nUnited States will be paid for the water that it\nultimately provides to the district.\nThe central point that I would like to leave you\nwith, though, here at the end is the importance of\nprotecting the relationship between the United States and\nWestlands. But although we disagree on some matters, we\nare able to reach accommodation and agreement, and when\nwe're able to do that, it's to the good of all concerned.\nThe contracts and the laws here are structured to allow\nthose types of agreements to be reached, and we think that\nallowing third party beneficiary suits would be very\ndisruptive of that -- that operation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Somach, will you tell us what the district's\nviews on this whole matter are?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART L. SOMACH\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT WESTLANDS WATER DISTRICT\nMR. SOMACH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJustice Stevens, and may it please the Court:\nWestlands Water District has argued in its brief\nthat petitioners are not intended third party\nbeneficiaries with enforceable rights under the 1963\ncontract. I want to make two points from the perspective\nof the district why this must be so.\nFirst, allowing a direct right of action by\npetitioners is not practical or consistent with the\ndistrict's need and ability to function as a governmental\nentity and to allocate all of the water that it receives\nunder contract to all of the landowners within the -- the\ndistrict. This is a scarce and valuable resource, and\nthese types of third party lawsuits jeopardize the\ndistrict's ability to be able to provide water pursuant to\nCalifornia Water Code provisions to all of the landowners\nwithin the district.\nSecond, the laws of the State of California and\nreclamation law, working in harmony one with the other -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Could you expand on\nthe first point a little bit? I mean, you say you don't\nwant to be bothered with lawsuits. Is -- is that -- is\nthat all that it amounts to?\nMR. SOMACH: No. I -- I think quite on the\ncontrary. You know, and unfortunately, the -- the history\nof this contract and these -- these issues has been\nanything other than the district avoiding litigation.\nThe -- the whole concept of a water district is\nnot to individualize or incrementalize the water and\ninterests in water in any one group of landowners or any\none landowner. The idea is that the rights of all of the\nlandowners to all of the water under the contract are to\nbe treated as a whole and allow the district to provide\nprotection to all of the landowners within the district as\na whole, the point there being that the water doesn't\nbelong to any one landowner or a group of landowners. It\nbelongs to the whole.\nAnd in fact, the way the district operates, the\nway it has to operate is in the context of the whole.\nBonds are issued. Encumbrances on lands are -- are\nincurred, all based upon not individual rights to water\nbut rather broad rights of water throughout the district.\nTo allow a small group of landowners to decide how to\nadminister the contract, how to enforce the contract in\nany one given situation leaves decisions that are critical\nto all of the landowners solely in the hands of an\nunaccountable small group of -- of landowners.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't -- can't such a suit be\nbrought in State court? I can't believe that this\ndistrict can do whatever it wants with the water.\nMR. SOMACH: Oh, absolutely not. Yes, it -\nyes, it can.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really?\nMR. SOMACH: No. What I meant to say was yes,\nyou are right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. SOMACH: And absolutely not. It can't do\njust anything it wants to do. It is subject, as a\ngovernmental entity, to all the strict requirements of\nCalifornia water law and governmental law, for that\nmatter. If, for example, these petitioners decide for\nwhatever reason they don't like a decision of the -- of\nthe board -- and in fact, that is an example that exists\nemanating out of the facts of this case. When the\ndistrict decided that it was better to settle the\nlitigation, these landowners first petitioned the -- the\ngoverning of the -- of the district and sought to -- to\nhave them not proceed in that manner, the way any other\ngroup of citizens or constituents with any other\ngovernmental entity would have proceeded. The district\ndecided, however, that it was in the best interests of all\nof the landowners within the district to settle the\nlitigation.\nNow, at that point in time certainly, these\npetitioners had the normal and ordinary rights that any -\nany constituent within the district has to be able to\nchallenge a decision that has been made by the district.\nThat includes, for example, writ proceedings, to argue\nthat the decision of the board was arbitrary, capricious,\notherwise unlawful, and that it should -- should be\nmandated to -- to proceed in some other fashion.\nIf the issue were damages, this district is\nsubject, like any other governmental entity within the\nState of California, to the government Tort Claims Act if\n-- if they're tortious type damages. And if we have\narguable impairment of property rights, this district is\nsubject to the California constitution, the United States\nConstitution, and the government code provisions that\nprovide for litigation with respect to those broader types\nof -- of damages.\nAnd quite frankly, this is a governmental body\nand it is very susceptible to the political process. It\nis not an easy thing for -- for the district to be\nstanding up here and telling you that its landowners\naren't entitled to receive what they want. That's a very\ndifficult for the district to -- to do. But in dealing\nwith the rights of the entire district, it's an absolute\nessential thing to do. If these landowners had exercised\ntheir prerogatives under California law, they could have,\nassuming they were the majority, controlled the decisions\nof the board of directors in the way that any majority\nconstituency controls the director -- the -- the direction\nand the decisions of a -- of a governing board.\nYou know, this -- this lawsuit is instructive in\n-- in a number of ways in terms of these practical\nconcerns that we have in terms of how in the world are we\ngoing to be able to administer a contract like this one.\nHow are we going to do all of the things that the Water\nCode has told us that we have to do if, at any given time,\na landowner, a small group of landowners is able to go\ninto Federal district court and independently decide that\nit wants to administer the contract that the district has\nwith the United States or to enforce terms of the contract\nthat it has with the United States in a manner that's\ninconsistent or different than the way -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't really understand why\nthat's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you\nin State court anyway. They -- they can always bring\nlitigation.\nMR. SOMACH: Well, it -- it really requires the\ndistrict to, in a sense, race to the courthouse with the\n-- with the petitioners in order to be there first in\norder to have its views of the contract -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the suit in State court,\nI assume, would -- would only be -- the claim would be\nthat you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your\ninterpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the\nsuit would fail.\nMR. SOMACH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas, this suit here -- it\ndoesn't matter how reasonable it is. If it's wrong, it's\nwrong. I mean, it's quite a different -\nMR. SOMACH: No. I think it is a different\nsituation, and I agree with what you -- what you have\nsaid, Your Honor.\nI do, however, want to -- to not avoid the\nconcern that may be expressed here, and -- and that is,\nthat -- that what it does is it -- it forces the district\ninto a situation of chasing its landowners, in essence,\naround from one litigation forum to another in order to\nensure that its means of controlling and -- and\nadministering the contract is not jeopardized. The fact\nthat the landowners -- if the landowners can move forward\nindependently with litigation with respect to the\ncontract, what it really does is create in a sense a -\nthe contract becomes this very interesting moving target\nwhere the district has its views about what the contract\nis and how it should be administered, how it should be\nenforced, and then it proceeds in one direction as, for\nexample, it did with the settlement in this litigation,\ndeciding that that was the best way to protect the\ninterests of the district.\nHad these petitioners on the merits in a\nhypothetical situation prevailed with a totally different\nresult, that would have substantially affected and\nimpacted the district's ability to be able to maintain the\nobligations and the commitments that it made to the other\nsettling parties. That destabilizes the ability of the\ndistrict to actually act in other governmental forums, in\nforums with the United States, with the State of\nCalifornia, with other districts in the context of\nattempting to say we control the contract, we enforce its\nterms, and we can make commitments. And when we make\nthose commitments, we can abide by and we can live up to\nthose commitments in a way that -- that governments ought\nto be able to do when they're -- when they're making those\ntypes of commitments.\nHaving the landowners being able to come or -\nand here, I want to make certain. When I use the word\nlandowners, I'm not saying that the landowners are not\nbeneficiaries of the contract. They certainly are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the provision in\nthe judgment at page 110 that was -- that was cited to us,\nthat -- that the parties may obtain other appropriate\nrelief by the filing of a new action?\nMR. SOMACH: Yes. I -- I think that that -\nthat phrase is actually begun as a proviso, and I view it\nas not limiting the ability of the area I landowners in\nthe Barcellos & Wolfsen judgment that you're -- that\nyou're quoting from from being able to act in any other\nway. It was a non-limiting provision. The -- the first\npart of the -- the part that you read deals with what\ntheir rights to enforce were. The second part was a\nproviso that simply said notwithstanding this, whatever\nelse you're able to do, you may do.\nThank you for your time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Somach.\nMr. Smiland, you have 9 minutes remaining, but\nyou do not have to use it all.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. SMILAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMILAND: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWhat happened here is that the United States\nsold half the water it was obligated to sell under the\ncontract. It doubled the price it was permitted to charge\non the other half. It was a massive harm to the farmers.\nI'm sure you understand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you say under the\ncontract. I thought there was a provision in the contract\nthat said that the United States will not be responsible\nfor under-deliveries, and I think it listed the drought\nand the last thing was any other cause.\nMR. SMILAND: Well, that's what we were about to\ngo to trial on, Your Honor. That's a merits issue. The\nNinth Circuit has abstained on whether there was a\nmandatory statutory duty to cut off this water, and I urge\nthe Court not to -- to dive into that pool.\nWe're trying to get in the courthouse doors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you were saying there's\n-- there's a right under this contract to recover from the\nUnited States for an under-delivery.\nMR. SMILAND: We have massive cross summary\njudgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go\nto trial on that -- on our claim of liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, please.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I've asked a lot of\nquestions. Go on.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make -- excuse me.\nWhat do you make of the argument for reasonable\nconstruction of the contract that in fact you just simply\ncannot have a system that would promise the chaos that -\nthat you are promising?\nMR. SMILAND: I -- I don't make much of it. The\nparties here and -- and the parties in the West fully\nunderstood for 20 years, after Allen Orchards, that the\nfarmers were intended third party beneficiaries. That's\n-- we settled in 1986 with that understanding, and this\nparade of horribles just has not come to pass.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is it correct, as Justice\nScalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation\nis concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary,\nunreasonable behavior?\nMR. SMILAND: That's true. And even more\nfundamentally, the United States breached the contract.\nThe district didn't do anything wrong. Why would we sue\nthe district when the United States cut off the water and\ndoubled the charge?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's arbitrary\nnot to -- not to -- for an agency, of which you're -\nyou're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to\ninsist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can\ninsist that the -- that a corporation enforce its\ncontracts.\nMR. SMILAND: We had a little mini-trial on that\nin front of the -- in front of the district court, and -\nand I made that argument, Your Honor, and the district\ncourt rejected it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, he was wrong. That was -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMILAND: I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess the reason that you\nwould sue the district would be if you didn't have any\nenforceable promise from the United States that they\ndidn't -- wouldn't do it.\nMR. SMILAND: Well, we -- we -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you think you do. That's\nthe issue in the case.\nMR. SMILAND: We had a stipulated judgment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so therefore -- therefore,\nI'm looking for where that promise is. And you started\nout by citing a page, which wasn't a page of the contract.\nIt was a page of some kind of settlement, and that page\nsaid that the district agrees that they entered into the\ncontract with helping the farmers in mind. I'm sure they\ndid. So what. I mean, I might buy a house with the idea\nof helping of my child. I'm going to give it to him.\nThat doesn't mean he can enforce the contract.\nMR. SMILAND: German Alliance, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean my child can enforce a\ncontract I enter into with another -- I buy a house and I\nsay I intend to give it to my daughter.\nMR. SMILAND: If the contract -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then she can enforce the\ncontract?\nMR. SMILAND: If the contract says -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. If the contract says.\nNow, that's why I was interested that you didn't cite\nlanguage in the contract.\nMR. SMILAND: Oh, yes, we did, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You -- well, I mean, you\nstarted out by referring me to page 110 or 111 -\nMR. SMILAND: That's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which doesn't. Now, what is\nthe language in the contract -\nMR. SMILAND: Articles -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that helps you the most?\nMR. SMILAND: -- 15 and 29(b) of the '63\ncontract and also the 1965 contract explicitly refers to\nbenefit, and probably most dramatically, the recordable\ncontracts that were signed actually with my clients and\nthe United States said that they were made in\nconsideration of the direct and indirect benefits that\nthose farmers would gain from the 1963 contract. Now,\nparagraph 4.2 in the judgment, which came some years\nlater, reconfirmed that.\nWhat was new and different about the judgment is\nthat for the first time it made explicit -- we think it\nwas implied earlier, but explicit that there was\nenforceable rights in the farmers, and we've argued it\nunder your German Alliance test that's not required, but\nif it was required, we bargained for, we got it. The -\nthe court approved that and the Congress approved that.\nAnd I -- I -- personally I've looked at all of these cases\nin recent months. It's very rare for an intended\nbeneficiary to have language like that.\nIn any case, as I was saying, my clients have\nsuffered massive losses. They've been litigating these\nclaims for 25 years. Everyone has assumed there was\nwaiver of sovereign landowner. Everyone assumed they're\nintended beneficiaries. And we think we should have a\nforum and a remedy and a right to our day in court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Smiland.\nThe case is taken under advisement.\n(Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
