        "content": "(10:15 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 12-418, United States v.\nKebodeaux.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nConvicted sex offenders pose a serious\nthreat to public safety. When those convictions are\nentered under Federal law, Congress has the authority to\nimpose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that\nconduct in order to protect the public.\nThe Fifth Circuit in this case applied a per\nse rule that once Respondent had completed his military\nsentence, Congress lost authority to apply a civil\nsanction for that violation of Federal law.\nThat per se rule is wrong.\nNothing in Article I prevents Congress from\nlegislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies\nfor past violations of Federal law. The Ex Post Facto\nClause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some\ndegree of protection against retroactive provisions, but\nno per se rule bars Congress from applying sex offender\nregistration requirements, which this Court has held to\nbe civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause\nto past Federal criminal convictions.\nNow -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the limit of that\npower? How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's\nrelated to sex offense or anything else, Congress could\nimpose any kind of registration requirement?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, certainly, Justice\nSotomayor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could it ask every\nconvicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test,\nbecause we know that people who have been convicted of a\ncrime are more likely to be recidivists?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, there\nare independent constitutional limits both outside of\nArticle I and within Article I that mean that I will\nanswer your question no, it's not the case that my\nposition today means there are no limits. There are\nlimits. If we -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what -- what is the\nlimit? Is it just safety? It can't be just safety of\nthe public, because you just said that it doesn't apply\nto recidivist Federal offenders, generally.\nMR. DREEBEN: The -- the principal\nlimitation on retroactive legislation is the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. Indeed, there would have been no need for\nan Ex Post Facto Clause if the Fifth Circuit were\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand. I\njust posited a civil registration for Federal offenders\nof any kind. That's not ex post facto under your\ntheory, so -\nMR. DREEBEN: So if -- if the Court agrees\nthat it's not a punitive measure and it is a remedial\nmeasure -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't know if I\nagree with that, but accept -- accepting that\nhypothetical.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, if you don't agree with\nit, then you'll be going on the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nand you won't be getting to Article I.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you know, that's\nsettled law. Whether it's right or wrong is a different\nissue.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is settled law, and that\nmeans that sex offender registration provisions aren't\npunitive. The question here is, are they within\nArticle I. And the Court in United States v. Comstock\nwent through an elaborate Necessary and Proper Clause\nanalysis -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in Comstock,\nit was very different than the situation here, because\nthe analysis was that the Federal Government basically\nwas the source of the problem in incarcerating sex\noffenders away from the State so that no State felt an\nobligation to do something with the problem of their\nrelease.\nYou don't have anything of that sort here.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. This provision, Mr. Chief\nJustice, rests on a different analysis than Comstock.\nIn Comstock, the problem was caused by Federal custody\nthat, as Your Honor has said, broke the relationship\nbetween the individual and some State that might take\ncognizance of him for purposes of sex offender civil\ncommitment.\nThe basis for the statute in Comstock was\nthat people in Federal custody, regardless of the nature\nof their prior convictions, might pose threats if\nreleased. The basis for the statute in this case is not\nthat the individual was in Federal custody. Federal\ncustody is irrelevant to it. The basis for the statute\nin this case is that this is a sex offender in violation\nof Federal law, and Congress has the authority to\nimpose, as was done in this case, criminal punishment,\nbut it also has the authority to impose civil regulatory\nsanctions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I assume that applies to\nall Federal crimes, right? Anyone convicted of any\nFederal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever\ncivil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a\ngood idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of\ncrime from reoccurring, right? I mean, nothing peculiar\nhere about sex crimes. Any -- any crime Congress can\nlater decide, you know, it would be a good idea if\nwhen -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime\nwith the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all\nsorts of different civil limitations.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, there is\nno per se rule in Article I that forbids retroactive\ncivil regulations imposed on a Federal offender. So the\nquestion -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, that's not the\npoint, that it's -- that it's retroactive. The point is\nthat it is not in execution of a Federal power.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the whole point\nin this case is that it's retroactive, because there\nisn't any serious dispute that if somebody commits a\nFederal sex offense they can be placed on supervised\nrelease for life so -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be an execution\nof a Federal power -\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, so is this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the power -- the power\nto prevent that crime and to punish it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, but Congress's power is\nnot limited to preventing and punishing crimes through\ncriminal law. Except for a brief interlude under United\nStates v. Halper where this Court viewed double jeopardy\nas precluding multiple criminal and civil sanctions, the\nCourt has recognized that when someone violates Federal\nlaw they're exposed both to criminal punishment and to\ncivil sanctions. The criminal punishment has to comply\nwith the Ex Post Facto Clause; the civil sanctions do\nnot. So what the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they have to be imposed\nsimultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of\nwhich the individual has been convicted. Here, the\ntrial is over, the conviction is over, and then some\nyears later the Federal Government decides, oh, it would\nbe a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes\nare -- are subjected to these limitations. That's quite\ndifferent from imposing that simultaneously as -- as a\npunishment for the crime. This is not a punishment for\nthe crime, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's precisely -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- what makes it a civil\nsanction. But, Justice Scalia, Your Honor is\npresupposing that Congress can only react to a sex crime\nthrough the criminal law and that it must have those\nlaws in place at the time of the punishment, and there\nis no such Article I precept.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument\ndepends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a\nFederal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense,\nnothing at all? We're just here arguing about the\nretroactivity under -- whether they have the authority\nunder Article I to impose punishment for not registering\nunder State law?\nMR. DREEBEN: This case turns entirely on\nthe fact that the defendant is a Federal offender. The\nsource of power in question was the power to regulate\nthe armed forces. This is an individual who committed a\nsex crime while in the armed forces. And Congress's\npower to address that and to prescribe remedies for it\nboth civil and criminal is entirely tied to the Federal\nnature of the offense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, we start out with the\npower under the Constitution to make rules to regulate\nthe military and we end up with a registration\nrequirement that applies to someone who's not in the\nmilitary and perhaps is not even living anywhere near\nany military installation. So what would be helpful for\nme is to start out with the constitutional provision,\nidentify a purpose of that that is served by this civil\nregistration that is imposed later, and trace this whole\nprogress through the Necessary and Proper Clause.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Alito, I think the\nmost helpful way to do that would be for me to progress\nthrough a series of examples that illustrate how\nprotecting the public against a Federal sex offender is\na legitimate aim under the Necessary and Proper Clause\nto implement the underlying constitutional authority.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: So start with a sex offender\nwho commits a sex offense in the military, is tried,\ncourt-martialed and sentenced. Subject to cruel and\nunusual punishment limitations, due process limitations,\net cetera, that individual can be incarcerated, placed\non supervised release potentially up to life. A\ncondition of supervised release, well-recognized and now\nmandated by Federal law, is that that individual\nregister as a sex offender. And the reason that that is\ntied to Federal law is that when an individual violates\nFederal law it is a legitimate purpose of Congress to\nprotect the public against recidivism by that\nindividual. So that's the criminal example that I\nbelieve is undisputed.\nNow, suppose that the Federal Government\ndidn't actually get the sex offender while he was in the\nmilitary. It missed the crime, but later information\ncomes to light still within the statute of limitations\nthat shows that while this person was in the military\nthey committed a sex offense. This court in United\nStates ex rel. Toth v. Quarles made clear that that\nindividual can be tried in an Article III court for his\ncriminal violation even though he's out of the military.\nIt's enforcing the rules that were impressed upon him at\nthe time while he was in the military.\nNow let me give a civil example and then I\nwill bring it right back to this case. Suppose that\nCongress concludes that sex offenses in the military are\na very serious problem and that there are a lot of\npeople who have escaped prosecution because of lax\ninterest in pursuing those crimes. And after a period\nof years, it sets up a board of inquiry and it says this\nboard of inquiry is going to look into sex offenses that\nwere committed at the time that people were in the\nmilitary, even if they're out of the military, and we're\ngoing to subpoena people to testify, and if individuals\nare determined in a civil proceeding to have committed\nsex offenses they may have their military records\nrevised, they may lose military benefits, and they may\nhave other civil sanctions imposed upon them.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you say in a civil\nproceeding, you mean?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, noncriminal.\nNoncriminal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's just by a\npreponderance of the evidence we think this guy\nprobably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime.\nMR. DREEBEN: Not going to be a criminal\npunishment that's imposed at the end of the day.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So just -- just more -\nmore likely than not is the test.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's an acceptable level of\nproof for the civil law.\nAnd if Congress can do that in order to\nprotect the integrity of the military and to promote\nconfidence in the military, then it's a very small step,\nif any step at all, to SORNA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if they can\ndo that. But that's not what they've done here. Your\nargument, as you told me a while ago, is linked to the\nFederal offense and the incarceration.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, absolute -- well,\nMr. Chief Justice, it's not linked to the incarceration.\nThis is the difference between this case and Comstock,\nand this is why the Solicitor General's concession in\nComstock on which the Fifth Circuit heavily relied has\nno applicability here.\nIn Comstock, it was irrelevant what offense\nthe individual had been committed. The problem was he\nwas in Federal custody, he was sexually dangerous at the\ntime he would be released. Ties had been broken between\nhim and the community, and if he were released it would\npose a threat to public safety that the Federal\nGovernment had power to protect against.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because the States\nwere not doing anything about it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here you have a\nsituation where I think at the time every State dealt\nwith the issue of whether the sex offenders should have\nto register or not.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. But Federal\nlaw did as well and Federal law provided encouragement.\nThis is actually a primary example of partnership\nbetween State governments and the Federal Government.\nThe Federal Government offers financial support, it\noffers logistical assistance, it offers tremendous\nresources of the U.S. marshals to track down sex\noffenders.\nAnd as this Court said in Carr v. United\nStates, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to have\nassigned a special responsibility for prosecuting\nFederal sex offenders who failed to register. This was\nintegral to this Court's reasoning in Carr, where the\nCourt was confronted with two provisions of 2250, the\ncriminal sex offense provision under SORNA. For State\noffenders, there had to be travel in interstate\ncommerce; for Federal offenders there didn't.\nThe Government argued that the provisions\nought to be given as co-extensive a reach as possible so\nthat the coverage of the statute would be equally\ncomprehensive for both State and Federal. And this\nCourt -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The discussion so far has\nassumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this\nline between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry\nabout ex post facto. Is that line made clear in our\nprecedents or is there some room to argue that if the\nline is somewhat blurred that there may be ex post facto\nconcerns here and that that in turn is a reason for\nconstitutional avoidance when we evaluate your argument?\nIs that -- is the civil -- a criminal\ndistinction with reference to ex post facto clause\nabsolutely foreclosed and clear in the facts of this\ncase?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, it is, I believe, Justice\nKennedy. In an opinion that you wrote for the Court,\nSmith v. Doe, which considered the retroactivity of\nAlaska's sex offender registration and notification\nprovisions, which are similar but not identical, to the\nFederal provisions, the Court went through the\nestablished analysis to determine whether the\nlegislature had intended a punitive effect and if it\ndidn't, whether there was the clearest proof that it was\npunishment in purpose and effect.\nNotwithstanding the legislature's intent,\nthe Court upheld the retroactive applicability of sex\noffender registration and notification, making clear\nthat it is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nNow, that's not to say that an individual\ncouldn't argue that SORNA is different or an individual\ncouldn't argue that the Due Process Clause makes it\neither irrational or substantively off limits to impose\nthis kind of civil remedy. The individual can also\nargue that running this through the Comstock factors,\nit's not reasonably adapted to fulfilling Congress's\naim. But what the Fifth Circuit did is apply a per se\nrule that it drew, I think, from the Solicitor General's\nstatement in Comstock that once an individual got out of\ncustody and was back in the control of the State and\nwithin its jurisdiction and population, then the Federal\nGovernment couldn't reach out and commit him as a sex\noffender.\nAnd there are two main distinctions between\nthat concession and this case. The first is, as I've\nalready alluded to, the Government's argument in\nComstock was based on custody. This case is based on\nthe consequences of the conviction itself. The second\ndistinction is that committing somebody civilly is a\nmassive intrusion on that individual's relationship with\nthe State.\nThe individual has been brought within\nFederal custody; they have no relationship with the\nState anymore. Whereas sex offender notification is far\nmore accommodating of State interests.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to what does this\ncivil -- civil-criminal line apply? Suppose instead of\na registration requirement, Congress just decided, you\nknow, our past punishments for sex offenses have not\nbeen -- have not been severe enough, and so we are now\ngoing to impose a civil fine on all -- all persons who\nhave been convicted in Federal court of sex crimes.\nIt's a civil -- it's a civil penalty, not a criminal\npenalty. That's okay?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not per se barred by\nArticle I, Justice Scalia. The question of whether it's\nconstitutional is really a question of individual rights\nanalysis and whether it passes through the necessary and\nproper gate under the considerations similar to what the\nCourt looked at in Comstock.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find that difficult to\nbelieve that -\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there's no -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that whether it's ex\npost facto and impermissible or not is simply\neliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling\nit civil.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it's not eliminated. It\nstill is available for an individual to argue, as\nRespondent did in this case in the district court but\nabandoned long before he got to the court of appeals,\nthat it violates due process, that it violates ex post\nfacto.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about the -- ex\npost facto.\nMR. DREEBEN: He can argue that. I submit\nthat he will lose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it's civil.\nMR. DREEBEN: If it in fact is civil and\npasses through this Court's analysis, then yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I find that difficult\nto grasp.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it's actually quite well\nestablished as a principle of double jeopardy law in\ncases like Hudson v. United States and United States v.\nUrsery. It's established in ex post facto law as a\nconsequence of Smith v. Doe. It's the foundation for\ndeciding whether a proceeding requires preponderance of\nthe evidence versus proof beyond a reasonable of doubt.\nThe Court has articulated this line in a variety of\ncontexts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument\nbased -- your argument based on Congress's authority\nwith respect to the military, your Article I argument,\nand you say it doesn't make a difference that he's no\nlonger in the military, does that -- do you come out\ndifferently if the basis for jurisdiction is asserted to\nbe inter -- interstate commerce?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. As long -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The fact that\nsomebody at some time in their life traveled across\nState lines means that the Federal Government can go\nback, even though their activity that's challenged in\nthe particular instance is only intrastate, and still\nassert jurisdiction over them?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that would probably fail\na Necessary and Proper Clause analysis, in which there\nhas to be a showing that the measure is plainly adapted\nto furthering the underlying power. This is not a\ndifficult problem that the Court has never confronted\nbefore. It has resulted in difficult permutations on\nparticular facts, but the Court has always recognized\nthat there is broad Necessary and Proper Clause\nauthority subject to limits. Those limits -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As broad as that\nauthority is, perhaps I'm going back to Justice Alito's\nquestion, which is if you put aside that it's part of\nthe punishment because you say it's not part of the\npunishment, you want us not to look at it as punishment\nbecause otherwise you'd run into the ex post facto\nproblem, you're saying we have a need today. Outside of\nprotecting the public from a recidivist, what's the\ninterest? Because that wasn't enough in Comstock. We\nmade it very clear that wasn't enough.\nSo if you take out all of the punishment\naspects of this, which you should have done at the time\nhe was sentenced and not now, what remains in terms of\nthe Federal interest?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's promoted?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is a sufficient Federal\ninterest in protecting the public from someone who\ncommitted a Federal crime. Supervised release\nessentially performs that function.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that was -- why did\nwe even bother going through anything in Comstock? If\nthat stands alone as a Federal interest, then anything\nwe do at any point with respect to any person who's\nviolated a Federal law would stand in the same shoes.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's a valid -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You could do whatever\ncivil penalties you want for as long as you want. We go\nback to my initial question and Justice -\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, really, the\nanswer to your question is the same. The answer to all\nof your questions is the same, which is that there is an\nanalysis that the Court went through in Comstock where\nit took into consideration history, it took into\nconsideration the nature of the fit between the purpose\nof Congress and the activity that it was regulated. It\ntook into account the degree to which the State\ninterests were accommodated, and it took into account\nthe degree of attenuation between the regulation and the\nunderlying offense. And it -- it didn't open up\nCongress to say any offense you've ever committed means\nCongress owns you for life, it can do whatever you want.\nIt has to pass through an analysis.\nBut the Fifth Circuit never conducted that\nanalysis except for believing that once the individual\nhad completed military service, once the individual had\ncompleted his criminal sentence, Congress lost all\nauthority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm getting confused\nbetween two different assertions of a Federal interest.\nEarlier you talked about the integrity of the military\nforces. They go back later, they think they should\naddress the fact that people were engaging in criminal\nactivities when in the military, they weren't -- they\nweren't found out, they weren't prosecuted. Later on\nthey can go back.\nBut then you say that the interest that's at\nissue here is preventing recidivism, and that doesn't\nseem to have anything to do with the integrity of the\nmilitary force.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it does because when the\ncriminal law finds someone who has violated Federal law,\nmany of the purposes of the sanctions that are imposed\non that individual are public protection purposes and\nanti-recidivism purposes. Most of the things that are\ndone on supervised release fulfill those purposes. If\nthose purposes were not validly connected to taking\nsomeone who's violated criminal law and imposing a suite\nof sanctions on them, then supervised release would\napparently be beyond Congress's authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it seems to me that\nwhen -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief\nJustice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the\npower to regulate the military. You're relying on -- on\nsome general Federal power to protect citizens against\npeople who have committed any Federal crimes. And I --\nI don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution.\nYes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your\ndescription, it has nothing to do with regulating the\nmilitary. It has to do with protecting the -- the\npublic at large from people who have committed Federal\ncrimes, military or not.\nMR. DREEBEN: As the Court has pointed out\nnumerous times, including in Comstock, there is very\nlittle authority in the Constitution in an enumerated\nway for criminal law at all. All of criminal law, with\nthe exception of a handful of instances that are\nspecified in the Constitution, comes in by virtue of the\nNecessary and Proper Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, because it\nprotects Federal functions. The Federal -- the criminal\napplicability to the armed forces protects the function\nof regulating the armed forces. But how does protecting\nthe public at large from people who have committed a\ncrime in the armed forces, how does that have anything\nto do with regulating the armed forces.\nMR. DREEBEN: That is inherent in taking\nsomebody who violated Federal law and imposing\nappropriate sanctions on them for that violation.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, it would help\nme in answering some of these questions if you went\nthrough the analysis on the assumption that this was\ninstead a Commerce Clause case. So take the military\nout of it; what would the necessary and proper analysis\nlook like?\nMR. DREEBEN: It would look essentially the\nsame, Justice Kagan. Somebody who violates a Federal\nlaw that's premised on the Commerce Clause, say a sex\noffender who travels in interstate commerce with the\nintent to commit a sex offense, has placed himself\nwithin the regulatory authority of the Federal\nGovernment. Now, that individual can be criminally\nprosecuted for that violation, and that violation\nfurthers Congress's interests in regulating interstate\ncommerce.\nCongress could also decide, you know, for\nsome of these sex offenders, criminal punishment is not\nthe right approach. The right approach is mandate sex\noffender rehabilitative counseling. And it might\ndiscover that that's so effective for a class of\noffenders that it's going to apply that even to people\nwhose offenses were committed before the law in question\nis passed. It can't punish those people based on\nretroactive legislation, but it can reach them with a\ncivil remedial measure so long as it passes through the\nComstock-type analysis of the Necessary and Proper\nClause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, you say\nnothing about the -- what was the opening argument in -\nin your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is\nsomething new added after is wrong because there were\nthese predecessor laws that established a Federal\nrequirement to register.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I believe\nthat the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that too. As we\ndescribe in our brief, Title 42 Section 14072(i)(3) and\n(4) did, in our view, impose criminal punishment on\nRespondent for failing to register as a sex offender at\nthe time he was in the military.\nWe think the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that\nstatutory analysis, but, more fundamentally, the Fifth\nCircuit was wrong in thinking that it mattered whether\nhe was under some sort of Federal criminal jurisdiction\nat the time that he was released from Federal custody.\nAnd if I could reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMs. Fuentes.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. FUENTES: Yes. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Government asks this Court to go beyond\nits holding in United States v. Comstock to allow the\nFederal Government to reach back, after a Federal\nsentence has expired, to bring back into Federal control\na person who has returned to the authority of the State.\nAnd I'm quite surprised to hear the\nGovernment say that this is not a Comstock analysis.\nI'm not sure they stuck with that throughout the\nargument, but I think the Comstock factors are factors\nthat this Court looks at quite frequently in doing any\nkind of a necessary and proper analysis.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Going back to -- to a\nprior question, are you challenging -- you didn't on\nappeal, but it seems as if you're accepting that the\nFederal Government has the power to impose this\nrequirement as part of a Federal sentence.\nMS. FUENTES: I think that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Are you -\nif it's not part of a Federal sentence but part of\nrelease, it's not announced at the sentence but it's\nannounced at the time the prisoner is put into\nsupervised release or release from jail, do you think\nthe Government has the power to impose it then?\nMS. FUENTES: In this case, on these facts\nand based on the Federal statutes that exist today, the\nanswer is yes. And the illustration, I think, is the\nway that SORNA works today. As the Government\nmentioned -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, SORNA today\nbecomes part of the supervised relief terms.\nMS. FUENTES: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking about\nSORNA today.\nMS. FUENTES: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about just\nany prisoner who has been in jail but it's not made, has\nnot been paid, part of the punishment.\nMS. FUENTES: I think the law permits a\nsentencing judge -- I'm not talking about Congress, but\na sentencing judge -- to go back and impose additional\nconditions of supervised release.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I don't know of\nthat power, but do you have a statutory -\nMS. FUENTES: It's 18 -- 18 United States\nCode Section 3583. And 3583 permits the sentencing\njudge to change conditions of supervised release based\non the factors that are considered important in\nsentencing in 18 United States Code Section 3583.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So that\npower -- I guess then what the Government is saying, as\nI understand their argument, if you have the power to do\nit at that point, why can't you have the power to do it\nlater?\nMS. FUENTES: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are the same factors\nthat compel permission for the Government to do it then?\nMS. FUENTES: It's because the way the\nstatute works, even though it wasn't announced at\nsentence, supervised release is considered to be part of\nthe sentence. So if I understand the question\ncorrectly, the reason the court can go back and impose\nthose conditions and possibly the reason that Congress\ncan go back and do it is because those statutes that\nI've mentioned, 3583 and 3553, have given notice to the\nindividual.\nJUSTICE ALITO: We are not talking -- I'm\nsorry.\nMS. FUENTES: That's all right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I didn't mean to interrupt\nyour question.\nMS. FUENTES: It's all right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: We're not talking about\nstatutory authorization. We are talking about\nconstitutional power. So if we start out with the\nexample of registration for life being imposed as part\nof supervised release, part of the criminal sentence,\nthen we go to an example where it is not part of the\ncriminal sentence but it is a civil requirement\ntriggered by a separate civil proceeding for every\nFederal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under\nFederal law.\nNow, if that were the setup statutorily,\nwould that fall within Congress's power under Article 1?\nMS. FUENTES: I think not, but I want to\nqualify that because it depends on what powers Congress\nis relying on.\nAnd let me give an example. I know the\nGovernment was -- a lot of the Government's argument\nrelies on this difference between criminal and civil\nconsequences.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, we know what -- and we\nknow what power they are relying on. Let's just look at\nthe power that they're relying on here: It's the power\nto make rules for the regulation of the military. So\npart of their -- in the exercise of their power to make\nrules for the regulation of the military, they impose a\ncivil sex offender registration requirement for someone\nconvicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice. That does not, in your judgment, fall\nwithin Article I?\nMS. FUENTES: It does if the person is still\nin the military or if he has been -- or if he has\ncommitted a criminal offense and the prosecutorial\npower, the Federal power to prosecute him for that\noffense, has not been exhausted, yes, that can be done.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How about if he is on\nsupervised release? He is not in the military, but his\nentire sentence has not been completed.\nMS. FUENTES: I think if he is still being\nsupervised by the military, then I think it's likely\nthat power exists.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then why not this?\nMS. FUENTES: Because Mr. Kebodeaux was not\non supervised release.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- why not? I mean,\nlook, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, \"If you\ncan think of a thing that is inextricably related to\nanother thing without thinking of the other thing, then\nyou have the legal mind,\" and that seems to be this\ncase. All right?\nMS. FUENTES: Yes, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So somehow I have to get\nout of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential\nviolation of due process part, the equal protection\npart, take that aside. Now I've got to just think about\nwhether it has, the Congress has the power under the\nprovision that Justice Alito said. I'm trying to do\nthat, and I've dissented in other cases on other\ngrounds.\nAll right. But in -- in just trying to do\nthat, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a\ncertain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have\nunfortunate problems in the military. They discover\nthere is a mental illness problem; the person's out of\nthe military. But the law says you can go and tell the\nlocal mental health authorities about this person even\nthough he's no longer there.\nAnd suppose the person had a criminal\nproblem in the military and was in prison and suppose\nthe law said, you know, you're the ones who got the\nsituation where he unfortunately got into that problem,\nand you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities\nabout his problems so they can take appropriate action.\nNow, if they can do that, why can't they\nhave the power under Article I to say really, you all\nhave to register. Now, maybe there are other things,\nbut you got this problem in the military. You were\nconvicted in the military. You did it in the military.\nWe turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as\npart of our military regulation, to be able to tell\nauthorities about you and to make you register according\nto State law.\nNow, no due process problem; I have to\nassume that away. No punishment, bad punishment\nproblem, none of those. But it's a power, all right?\nWhy not?\nMS. FUENTES: Well, the power can't go to\nboth of the examples that you've given. I don't see any\nproblem with them giving notice. That does not impose a\nFederal obligation on an individual. So there is no\npower being exerted on the individual. They can have a\npublic -- a public protection purpose and they can\ntell -- tell authorities who need to deal with the\nindividual, and those authorities may have the power\nthrough State power -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where you're leading me,\nbecause I'm not so worried about this case, but where\nyou're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and\nall kinds of other cases, suddenly a distinction arises\nthat Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things\nhaving Federal authorities do this and that, but you\ncouldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can\nimagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so\nwhat I'm worried about is following this distinction\ninto other areas.\nMS. FUENTES: I don't think that is a\nproblem, and I think the reason is I disagree\nfundamentally with the Government. I think necessary\nand proper analysis is important in each case and it\ndoes bear similarities in each case. But depending on\nthe power being relied upon, the analysis can be quite\ndifferent. Commerce Clause is a very broad power.\nI can't say whether this sort of thing,\ndepending on the Commerce Clause, would be right or\nwould be wrong. Look at the power to make a uniform\nrule of naturalization.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me -- let me try\nthis chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your\nreaction. We're starting out with the power of Congress\nto make rules for the regulation of the military. And\none of the things that they want to do in making those\nrules is to make military installations acceptable to\nthe local communities where they are located.\nThey know from experience, for example, it's\nhappened in Okinawa, that when have you military\npersonnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people\noff base, it can cause tremendous opposition. And this\nis what happened here; not the opposition, but an\noffense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the\nbase.\nSo in order to ensure that there -- we don't\nhave excessive civilian opposition to the location of\nmilitary bases, we are going to do a number of things.\nOne thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members\nof the military who commit these offenses. This will\ndeter; this will incapacitate. But also, to provide\nfurther assurance to the community that these people are\nnot going to be dangerous, we are going to require them\nto register.\nNow, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd\nlike to get your reaction. Why could Congress not do\nthat under the Necessary and Proper Clause?\nMS. FUENTES: Well, I think while that\nperson is still within the criminal jurisdiction, or any\nFederal jurisdiction, it could be done. I think that\nonce that jurisdiction has been exhausted, once the\ncriminal prosecution power has been exhausted, once the\nperson has returned to the authority of the State, and I\nthink that analysis is important always.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to go that\nfar though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice\nAlito just gave. This is not a statute which only\nrequires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs\naround the military installation. This requires him to\nregistrate anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of\nAlaska where -- it's just not this case.\nAnd even -- even if you would allow that,\nand say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable\nconnection to the power to regulate the military, to say\nwherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different\nquestion, isn't it?\nMS. FUENTES: I think it may well be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But yet, now that's exactly\nthe problem for me, because the -- the wilds of\nAlaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -\nthat sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a\npost office there, then what -- the military is all\nright, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered\nto the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem.\nThat seems to be okay.\nBut you say it's not going to be okay to\ntell him he has to go and make that registration. At\nthat point what you've done is like Madison. I mean,\nit's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I\nthink Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading\na lack of power because of a civil rights problem.\nI mean, it's -- the difference between the\ntwo cases is really not the need because we have to\nassume the need. The difference is the restriction on\nthe individual. And it's that part that I'm suddenly\nworried about the Commerce Clause and every power in\nArticle I being read with exceptions in the civil rights\narea even though we have the amendments to protect the\ncivil rights problems.\nMS. FUENTES: I haven't thought of it that\nway and that really isn't the argument that I'm making.\nI think that the military has jurisdiction. It's gotten\ninformation about this individual when it had power over\nhim and they can talk to whomever they care to about\nhim, or whether -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've never -- we've never\nheld, have we, that what the Federal Government can\nitself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can\nimpose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and\nProper Clause? Aren't there two different -- what is\nnecessary and proper for the Federal Government itself\nto do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the\nFederal Government to require private individuals to do.\nMS. FUENTES: I absolutely agree with that.\nAnd I think that this goes back to something that the\nGovernment -- well, it gives me an opportunity to\naddress something the Government has said about the\nFifth Circuit's opinion. That it is a per se rule, and\nthat is just incorrect. I -- I have to disagree with\nthat. And I have to disagree with it because the -\neverything the Fifth Circuit said was limited by these\nfacts.\nThese facts are what controls the case. And\nthe Fifth Circuit took great care to make a very narrow\nruling. And that ruling, the Fifth Circuit said, is\nthat it's unconstitutional, SORNA's requirements, as\napplied to Mr. Kebodeaux and others like him. It has no\neffect on Congress's ability to impose conditions on a\nprisoner's release from custody or on Congress's ability\nto effect the registration requirements for anyone who\nhas been convicted after SORNA's enactment.\nSo really, it is not a per se rule. It is a\nrule, maybe you call it per se as it -- as it affects\npeople in Mr. Kebodeaux's position, but I think that is\nvery different from what the Government is arguing.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I\ndon't quite understand about the argument, this goes\nback to Justice Alito's original question. You seem to\nsay that if this -- if Congress passed a civil statute\nlike this one within the time that Mr. Kebodeaux was in\ncustody or within the time that he was under supervised\nrelease, that that would be appropriate.\nBut I guess what I don't get is why the\nFederal interests change, whether it's the day before he\ngets out of supervised release or the day after he gets\nout of supervised release. What in the Federal\ninterests shift based on that?\nMS. FUENTES: I'll answer that question\nfirst, then come back to another.\nIt's not a question, I don't think, of\nFederal interest. It's a question of Federal power.\nAnd you have to look at the individual power being\nexercised. And so the way I look at it is what's the\ndifference if the Federal Government makes a rule for a\nperson in the military before -- when he's in the\nmilitary or after he gets out of the military? That's\nall the difference in the world. In -- in -- that's our\nargument. That is all the difference in the world.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I wasn't assuming that\nhe was in the military while he was on supervised\nrelease.\nMS. FUENTES: I'm sorry. I didn't hear.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I was assuming that he was\nout of the military in both these cases, but that you\nsaid while he was still serving his sentence, it would\nbe appropriate for Congress to add this additional\nthing, but not after.\nMS. FUENTES: I think -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In both cases, he's not in\nthe military anymore.\nMS. FUENTES: Constitutionally, it -- it can\nbe all right constitutionally, depending on the\nstatutory procedures that govern it. And the way that\nthe Federal law operates now, the statutes that I\nmentioned, 3583 and 3553, the way those statutes -\nstatutes operate is they -- they give someone notice\nthat their conditions of supervised release can be -\ncan be changed. And so there isn't an ex post facto\nproblem with that.\nAnd there isn't a power problem with that,\nbecause the criminal -- the power to make the criminal\noffense and punish it still exists while that person is\non supervised release. It has expired with respect to\nMr. Kebodeaux, and I think that is one of the most\nimportant points in this case, and it goes along with\nthe Comstock analysis.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it your argument that\nCongress lacks the power to impose supervised release\nafter the date when the person leaves the military?\nMS. FUENTES: No. After the criminal\nsentence is served.\nI'm sorry. Maybe I didn't understand the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Someone is sentenced to\nprison -\nMS. FUENTES: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- under the UCMJ, released,\ndishonorably discharged from the military. Can Congress\nsay the person has to remain on supervised release for a\nlonger period of time after he is returned to civilian\nstatus?\nMS. FUENTES: Not if -- not unless it was -\nthat provision was imposed as part of the sentence or\nwhile he was still within the Federal power, before the\nFederal criminal jurisdiction expires.\nJUSTICE ALITO: See, I understand -- I can\nunderstand why that might create -- that might raise all\nsorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so\nforth.\nBut I don't see how that -- how that\nconnects with the question whether Congress has the\npower to do it under -- under Article I -\nMS. FUENTES: Well, I'm not sure -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- under the power to\nregulate the military.\nMS. FUENTES: Yes. I'm not sure I'm\nanswering the question correctly, but that power doesn't\nlast forever. The powers -- there are some powers in\nthe Constitution which may last longer than others, and\nthe example I raised before was the rule of making\nuniform naturalization. That's a broader power, I\nthink, than the military power.\nAnd we see that in the cases the\nGovernment's mentioned and we've mentioned, the Toth\ncase and the Kinsella case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you could be making\nthe argument that the power to make rules for the\nmilitary applies only to people who are in the military,\nand that once you're out of the military that power does\nnot permit Congress to do anything special to you.\nBut you're not making that argument, I\ngather.\nMS. FUENTES: No. No, I'm not making that\nargument. And again, it goes to the individual facts\nand the power asserted and the way the power operates\nalways makes a difference.\nThe example that the Government gave with\nthat board of inquiry and being able to bring people\nback in, I find that whole scenario very questionable.\nBut there -- there were people who were -- were\nreceiving military benefits, if I understood it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would you write this\nopinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice\nBreyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce\nClause, which has been since Madison more broadly\ndefined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of\nensuring that you're not closing off other things that\ncan be done after someone leaves, that might be related\nto, like punishing a crime that you find out about\nafterwards. How would you write this opinion?\nMS. FUENTES: Just the way the Fifth Circuit\ndid in its en banc opinion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it wasn't really\nhelpful, because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting\nprinciple like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that\nif you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to\nhave an independent basis, a power for the imposition\nof -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone.\nMS. FUENTES: I'm not certain an opinion\nlike that could be written. I think that the limits,\nthe limitations that exist, are on the narrowness of the\nway the opinion is written. But future cases I don't\nthink can be decided that way.\nCertainly, principles can be articulated\nwhich help to limit. And I think the -- the best you\ncan say in terms of limiting principles is it's going to\ndepend on the enumerated power upon which the government\nrelies to impose this obligation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how -- I'm not\nsure that makes much sense. You're saying if they're\nrelying on the enumerated power with respect to the\nmilitary, they can do more than if they're relying on\nthe enumerated power over interstate commerce?\nMS. FUENTES: No. And if that's your\nunderstanding -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in what sense -\nMS. FUENTES: -- I -- I apologize. I did not\nmean that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in what sense\ndoes it then depend on which enumerated power they're\ninvoking?\nMS. FUENTES: Well, let -- let me give an\nexample that goes to the collateral consequence cases\nthat the Government raised.\nThe Government raises, for example, the\nHudson case, where a person who is convicted of bank\nfraud both can be punished criminally and then can be\ndebarred civilly from participating any more with\nFederal Government contracts. I think the words that\nwere used in the Hudson case were \"no longer may have\nbusiness doings with an insured bank.\"\nOkay, that has to be, I think, the spending\npower. The Government can decide with whom it wants to\ndo business. If it's dealing with an insured bank, then\nit can impose that civil consequence. And it can do\nit -- I don't want to use the word \"independently\" of.\nThey may do it by reason of the criminal conviction, but\nthere is an independent power to do it.\nThat power doesn't exist here, and so it\nwould have to be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They say -- they say\nit exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate\nthe military forces.\nMS. FUENTES: Well, I don't think it does.\nPerhaps I don't understand the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm trying to\nsee why you're saying the enumerated power under the\nSpending Clause allows them to take this subsequent\naction, but the enumerated power under the Military\nClause does not.\nMS. FUENTES: Well, because the -- I'm\nsorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthat if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper\nClause, that you need an enumerated power that the\nNecessary and Proper Clause is going to serve.\nBut I don't see how it makes a difference\nwhich enumerated power you're talking about.\nMS. FUENTES: I think it all -- I think it\ndoes turn on the nature of the power. I mean, could you\nuse the military power to say you, Mr. Bank Fraud\nClient, cannot contract with the Government any more?\nNo.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I get to ask the\nquestions. You don't.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FUENTES: Sorry. You are so correct on\nthat. I apologize.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but it's the\nmilitary -- look, it's the military that they are\nmostly -- that they're relying on.\nMS. FUENTES: Yes. And it -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they say -- I mean, the\nfamous statement -- I looked it up -- \"Let the end be\nlegitimate, let it be within the scope of the\nConstitution, and all means which are appropriate and\nnot forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and\nProper Clause.\"\nAll right? The end is to protect the\ncommunities from those individuals in respect to those\nmatters that they became dangerous with when they were\nin the military; okay? That's the end.\nAnd is the means appropriate? They say yes.\nThey say, after all, the means here is, notify them when\nwe're -- you're moving around. And therefore, is it\nforbidden?\nWell, we're not supposed to consider that\npart, but -- so leave that out. But the -- the others,\nthey say is okay. So that's the basic.\nDo you think maybe we should send this back\nto the -- to the Fifth Circuit? The Government suggests\nthat -\nMS. FUENTES: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because they didn't get\nit right in respect to what the previous statutes\nrequire.\nWhat about all that?\nMS. FUENTES: Well, the Fifth Circuit did\nget it right with respect to the previous statute. And\nthe reason that the Government wants to send it back is\nbecause they say that the Fifth Circuit relied on the\nfact that Mr. Kebodeaux was unconditionally released.\nAnd as a matter of fact, he was unconditionally\nreleased. But they equate unconditional release with\nrelease free from a registration requirement.\nWe have gone over that in great length in\nour brief. The Government is simply wrong about that,\nfor the reasons that we state in our brief. And I can\ngo into those, if you want, if you'd like.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just want to know what to\ndo if I end up thinking they are right.\nMS. FUENTES: Yes. They are -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your recommendation\nthere on that assumption? I'm not saying I would, but\nI'm just saying on that assumption.\nMS. FUENTES: I -- I guess it depends on\nwhich assumption. The Fifth Circuit would not have\nchanged its opinion in this case because Mr. Kebodeaux,\nas a matter of fact, whether the Government agrees or\nnot, was not released on condition that he comply with\nsex offender registration requirements.\nYou can see the difference between\nMr. Kebodeaux's release and the release of a person who\nis released on conditions that he comply with\nrequirements, and that is in 35 -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your argument is he was\nreleased on condition of State registration. Isn't your\nargument dependent only on that there was no Federal\nregistration requirement?\nMS. FUENTES: No. It is dependent on\nwhether that release was conditioned on his\nregistration, and it wasn't. Today, when a person is\nreleased from custody on supervised release, it is a\ncondition of that release under 3583 that he comply with\nsex offender registration requirements. What happens if\nhe doesn't comply?\nHe can go back to prison on the original\nconviction, because he was released on condition that he\ncomply with Federal sex offender requirements. It just\ngoes to -- to the judge. It's by preponderance of the\nevidence.\nThat is not what happened here.\nMr. Kebodeaux was released, not on any conditions. Now,\nthe State may have imposed an independent obligation to\nregister, but that was not a condition of his release.\nAnd so it is not the case, as a matter of fact, that he\nwas released on condition.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The bottom line is you\ndon't think the Wetterling Act applied to him. Is that\nyour point?\nMS. FUENTES: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Wetterling\nAct didn't apply to him; is that -\nMS. FUENTES: No. I don't think the\nWetterling Act applied to him.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At all?\nMS. FUENTES: Correct. But even if it did,\nit was -- it's far removed from a registration\nrequirement. It is a penalty, not a registration\nrequirement.\nThe State imposed a registration\nrequirement. Wetterling did not.\nAnd if you'd just read -- and I think that's\nwhat the Fifth Circuit did. They just read the statute,\n14072(i)(3) and (i)(4). It doesn't say a person who is\nrequired to register will follow -- will suffer the\nfollowing punishment. It says a person described in\n4042(d), a person who's been into a court-martial.\nIf you look at the rest of 14072 and parts\nof 14071, there are provisions that say such and such\nperson shall register. That is a registration\nrequirement.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I guess what I'm not\nunderstanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the\ndifference between a requirement of registration and a\npenalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit\ncutting -- slicing the baloney thin.\nAnd if you think that he was in any event\nwhile he was undergoing his sentence subject to a\npenalty, it's a pretty minor exercise of Federal power,\nisn't it, to say that, instead of making you just\nsubject to a penalty for doing something, we're going to\ntell you, you have to do it?\nMS. FUENTES: I guess I don't. And the\nreason is it's not the degree of power exerted, it's\nwhether the power exists. And once Mr. Kebodeaux\ncompleted his Federal sentence, the military power,\nwhich permitted him to be prosecuted and punished, had\nexpired.\nAnd so in some ways it's like there's\nFederal enclave jurisdiction on this side of the street\nwhere the base exists, where the Navy yard exists, and\nthings that happened here can be punished by the Federal\nGovernment, but just across the street the exact same\nthings can occur and the Federal Government cannot\npunish it.\nSo I think it is very careful to draw those\nfine lines, and I think it is essential when discussing\nissues of the enumerated powers, because they are\nlimited.\nI don't mean to move on fast. I did want to\nmention -- I know my time is almost up -- that we have\noffered an alternative ground for deciding the\nconstitutional questions here: The effective date\nargument. I know we didn't raise it in the Fifth\nCircuit, but this Court has the authority to consider\nit, and we have put into our brief all the reasons that\nMr. Kebodeaux is not covered by SORNA to begin with.\nIn the Sixth, Ninth and Third Circuits, he\ncould not be prosecuted under SORNA, and so that is an\nalternative basis that I think the Court can decide this\ncase on.\nAnd if there are no other questions, I will\ncede the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAs I understand Respondent's argument,\nRespondent concedes that he could have been put under a\nlifetime requirement to register with State authorities\nand punished federally if he did not, if only that\nrequirement had been imposed on him either at the time\nof sentencing or in a parallel civil proceeding that\noccurred while he was in the military.\nThis case, therefore, reduces to a question\nof timing. The essential argument that Respondent is\nmaking is that Congress had its -- had its authority\nexpire because it didn't exercise it. There's some sort\nof notion that Congress must speak now or forever hold\nits peace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not unusual.\nWhen you're released from the military, for example,\nyou're no longer subject to -- to Congress's\njurisdiction over the military. That's a matter of\ntiming too, isn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's just wrong,\nJustice Scalia, because this Court made clear in United\nStates ex rel Toth v. Quarles that if an individual has\nleft the military but hasn't been prosecuted, they can't\nbe court-martialed, but they can be prosecuted in an\nArticle III clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not for something that\nthey've done after they left the military. That's a\nquestion of timing. Had they left the military when\nthey committed this crime? If so, they can't be\nprosecuted under -- under that power of the Federal\nGovernment.\nMR. DREEBEN: But sex offender registration\nis a consequence of the military crime. That was\ncommitted while they were in the military. It's a civil\nremedy that may, consistent with other constitutional\nprovisions, be imposed retroactively.\nAnd this case comes down not to whether any\nmember of the Court agrees with the Ex Post Facto\nDoctrine analysis in Smith v. Doe or whether there might\nbe due process or other concerns out there, it comes\ndown to whether Congress has Article I authority to\nsay -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's not\nlimited. You've limited it to sex offenses, but the --\nCongress could say it's important to us that people who\nserve in the military behave correctly even after\nthey're released. So it is a Federal offense to do\nanything that violates State law for the rest of their\nlives, and your argument would say, well, that's part of\ntheir authority to regulate the military and so it's\nokay.\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me make two points about\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, a standard\ncondition of Federal supervised release is that the\nindividual shall not violate any Federal, State or local\nlaw, and for many sex offenders, supervised release runs\nfor life.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's part of his\nsentence. That's part of the punishment imposed. You\nassert that this is not part of the punishment imposed.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't see any relevance that\nhas to Article I authority; it has relevance to other\nconstitutional provisions.\nSo, insofar as supervised release does\ncontemplate this longstanding, continuous jurisdiction,\nthat's a feature of Federal law that the Court ought to\nkeep in mind in the way that it writes this opinion.\nBut second, if Congress passed such a law,\nit's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just\nthat there's no per se rule that says it can't. The\nCourt would -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to my\nquestion is yes, Congress can do that. It can say\nanyone in the military is subject for the rest of their\nlife to Federal jurisdiction. Whatever is a State law\ncrime is a Federal crime.\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not\ngoing to say no to that question, because I don't want\nto foreclose options that Congress may decide it's\nappropriate to pass, but the Court -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Who knows what\nthey'll do, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: But the Court does not have to\nagree that that is constitutional -- may I complete my\nsentence?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- in order to uphold this\nnarrowly focused, tailored law that looks at a specific\ncrime and imposes a specific requirement that's directly\ntied to the nature of that crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
