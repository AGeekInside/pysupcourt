FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Confrontation Clause prohibited the\nadmission of the accomplice's custodial statement here for\ntwo reasons: first, because its interlocking nature did\nnot establish its reliability under this Court's Roberts\njurisprudence; and second, and more fundamentally, because\nthe accomplice's custodial statement amounted to out-of-\ncourt testimony that was never submitted to cross-\nexamination, in violation of the traditional understanding\nof the right to confrontation.\nQUESTION: When you say out-of-court testimony,\nMr. Fisher, what do you mean by the word testimony?\nMR. FISHER: What I mean, Mr. Chief Justice, is\nsomeone giving a statement out of court that is the\nfunctional equivalent of what they would do in court,\nwhich is to say they're giving the authorities a statement\nthat is describing an event in a way that they understand\nis going to be used in a criminal investigation.\nQUESTION: So it may -- it -- the -- it applies\nto the -- if it's made to the authorities but not to a\nthird person?\nMR. FISHER: Ordinarily that's the -- that would\nbe the dividing line.\nQUESTION: Why is that?\nMR. FISHER: Well, because the Confrontation\nClause, to go back to the text and to start with the text,\ntalks about being a witness against somebody. And the --\nand the common understanding of that term is to give a\nstatement that you understand is going to be used in a\ncriminal investigation, and when you're giving a statement\nto the authorities, here a custodial statement to the\npolice, that's a different situation than the ordinary,\neveryday occurrence of speaking to a friend or a colleague\nor something.\nQUESTION: But your ultimate criterion is was it\nmade with the understanding that it would or probably be\nused for prosecutorial purposes.\nMR. FISHER: That's the way I read the -- the\nterm witness against in the Constitution. It's the\ngateway to the Confrontation Clause. Yes, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: So in an auto accident, a private\ninvestigator -- it's a serious accident. Private\ninvestigators for both of the parties come out and make --\nand make notes of what the witnesses said. Is -- is that\ntestimonial?\nMR. FISHER: The private --\nQUESTION: It's a later criminal proceeding and\nit's --\nMR. FISHER: Well, I mean, I -- I think that\nthat's the kind of a statement that ordinarily is not\ngoing to be testimonial. You know, an auto accident -- I\ntake it you're -- you're talking about an auto accident in\nterms of a criminal case. But --\nQUESTION: Well, it's -- it's an auto accident\nand insurance investigators are all over the scene when it\nlater turns into a criminal case.\nMR. FISHER: I mean, that's the kind of a\nsituation that there could be a difficult question in\nsomething like that, but I think that is likely not to be\ntestimonial.\nQUESTION: Well, it's --\nQUESTION: What about if the -- what about a\npolice officer who does the same thing?\nMR. FISHER: I think the police officer\ncertainly tips the balance and certainly when somebody is\ntalking to a police officer, that's the kind of a\nstatement they understand is going to be used in court.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if we're going to change,\nas you suggest in your brief, to using this term\ntestimonial, it certainly does not bring any great\ncertainty, does it, if you say something tips the balance\none way or another? Obviously, you're going to get a lot\nof close cases.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I understand, Mr. Chief\nJustice, there are going to be some close cases out on the\nmargins, and I acknowledge that. But what the testimonial\napproach does is it covers the core cases, the ones that\nthe Confrontation Clause has always been concerned with.\nAnd really, it's not so much a new test. What\n-- what the testimonial approach does is really sum up\nwhat this Court itself did in interpreting the common law\nand bringing that under the umbrella of the Sixth\nAmendment starting in Kirby and Mattox, the Court's\nearliest decisions on the Confrontation Clause, really all\nthe way up through Douglas in the 1960's where actually in\nthat very opinion the Court uses the term to describe a\ncustodial confession -- the Court uses the term the\nequivalent of testimony. And so that's the kind of a\nsituation we're talking about to --\nQUESTION: When you --\nQUESTION: But you -- you -- your proposal would\neffect a significant change in doctrine, I guess, from the\nRoberts case, and I think even under your proposal certain\ntestimonial statements would be admissible against the\ndefendant, for instance, where the defendant has\ncontributed to making the witness unavailable and so\nforth.\nMR. FISHER: Well, the --\nQUESTION: I mean, you -- you would still have\nsome testimonial statements in there.\nTell me which of our cases, since the Roberts\ndecision, would have come out differently under your\nproposed approach.\nMR. FISHER: I don't think, Your Honor, any\ncases since Roberts.\nQUESTION: No case.\nMR. FISHER: Nor any case before Roberts.\nQUESTION: Then why change?\nMR. FISHER: Because the lower courts aren't\ngetting it right, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think\nthat the problem is, is that the Roberts approach sets up\na framework that is both unworkable in practice and is\nleading to consistently anomalous results. And I think\nit's --\nQUESTION: Idaho would have -- v. Wright would\nhave come out the same way because the doctor who took the\nstatements of the child was acting at the request of the\npolice?\nMR. FISHER: That's how I understand the facts\nof the case, Justice Kennedy. The victim was -- was in\npolice custody at the time of the examination, and it was\nin coordination with the police. So, yes, Idaho v.\nWright, as well as all this Court's other cases, would\ncome out.\nBut it's important, you know, to go back to the\nquestion and say, you know, why change from Roberts if\nwe've gotten to the right places in -- in our cases. And\nthe answer is, you know, certainly this Court may never\nhave to change from Roberts, but simply understanding the\nway that Roberts is working in the lower courts I believe\nshould cause this -- cause the Court great concern.\nThe --\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't that our -- our\nfunction in part? We occasionally take cases from lower\ncourts to straighten out misconceptions. Presumably\nthat's how these things get worked out.\nMR. FISHER: That's correct, Justice O'Connor,\nbut, you know, I would submit that you're going to have to\npractically fill your docket with Confrontation Clause\ncases doing error correction in order to come out correct\nin all these cases.\nQUESTION: Well, we've -- but we've had Roberts\nfor 23 years, and we certainly haven't filled our docket\nwith Confrontation Clause cases.\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's right. And that's --\nand -- and what's happened, because you haven't done that,\nis the lower courts are reaching some very, very bad\nresults. I was responding to Justice O'Connor's question\nabout why change from Roberts if we're getting to the\nright solution, and the reason is because the way that the\ntest is framed, it just simply is unworkable in the lower\ncourts. As we cited in our brief, there are -- we\ngathered 20 factors that lower courts are using for\nindicia of reliability. We could have listed 40 or 50.\nThe United States is asking you, as well as the\nState, to stick with this -- stick with this reliability\napproach for all of its faults. And you know, the -- the\nironic thing with that kind of a -- of -- of a position is\nthe more testimonial the statement is, the more reliable\nit is, and in turn --\nQUESTION: Before you give the reasons, I -- I\nwant to go back to what you said. You say the test should\nbe functional equivalent of testimony. The functional\nequivalent is a little vague, and the law professors in\ntheir amicus brief suggest that the question should be,\nwould a reasonable person in the position of declarant\nanticipate that the statement would likely be used for\nevidentiary purposes? Would you accept that as a -- a --\nwould you adopt that phrasing of the question, or do you\nhave a different phrasing, or do you think if we did\nfollow your approach, the opinion should simply say\nfunctional equivalent?\nMR. FISHER: Well, first of all, Justice Breyer,\nyou don't have to get too far into that in this case\nbecause, of course --\nQUESTION: No, no. But I mean it's true that --\nI realize that, but -- but perhaps we could do a little\nbit better than say just testimonial. If -- if we\naccepted your approach --\nMR. FISHER: I think --\nQUESTION: -- so I'm -- I'm -- I want your\nopinion on that. I mean, there -- we have several briefs\nhere. We have variations on the theme, and I want to know\nwhich variation you think is the best or which is the\nworst. I read you one of them.\nMR. FISHER: I think I agree with the starting\npoint of the functional equivalent of testimony. And then\nI think that the law professors' test, the reasonable\nexpectation, is a good test, and I would -- I would\nembellish that by saying that I think that what we have is\n99 cases out of 100 that's going to be the situation that\nI -- I believe the Chief Justice brought up, which is the\n-- somebody speaking to the authorities in the course of\nthe investigation of a crime, somebody giving a statement\nto the authorities or directing one to them.\nQUESTION: Would there be anything that fit in\nyour category where the person to whom the statement is\nmade is not an officer, either a police officer or\nprosecutor?\nMR. FISHER: I think there may be, and the\nreason -- I think there may be a -- a rare, rare case,\nJustice Ginsburg, in a scenario -- you know, come up with\nhypotheticals. One possible scenario might be somebody\ngiving a statement to their friend and directing them to\ntell the police. So, you know, simply using an\nintermediary where we know the statement is going to the\npolice, but --\nQUESTION: Why -- why should it depend on the\nintent of the declarant? I -- why is that -- why does\nthat make the declarant a witness within the meaning of\nthe Confrontation Clause? I mean, suppose -- suppose the\npolice get -- get the statement from the declarant\nsurreptitiously. They do not let -- let him know that\nthey are, in fact, the police. That -- that would\ndisqualify it under the law professors' test from being\ntestimony?\nMR. FISHER: Well, in that --\nQUESTION: Because he would not know that this\nwas going to be used in court.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I mean, I think that's a\nsituation -- you know, and this is where the definitional\nproblem gets difficult. I mean, because the other part of\nthe Confrontation Clause is a limitation on State power,\nand it says -- you know, going all the way Blackstone,\nit's a limitation on the State molding statements that\nit's going to use later in a criminal investigation. So\nif that kind of a situation were present where somebody is\nmolding somebody's statement, I think that might be\nsomething the Confrontation Clause is concerned with as\nwell.\nAnd that goes back to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion to say that, yes, there may be, you know,\ndifficult cases -- difficult hypothetical out in the\nmargin, but what we have here is a test that covers what\nare the time-and-again cases that are coming before this\nCourt and coming before the lower courts.\nQUESTION: Well, but --\nQUESTION: Are you -- just -- just with the\ndialogue with Justice Scalia, because I'm interested in\nthe same problem, is it the intent of the speaker or the\nintent of the person taking the statement that would be --\nbe more relevant in your view?\nMR. FISHER: Well, certainly I -- I -- you know,\nyou don't have to decide that question in this case, but I\nthink that if either one of them --\nQUESTION: Well, of course -- of course, we do.\nI mean, I -- I really object to saying, you know, just --\njust don't worry about it. We'll worry about it later. I\nmean, if there are real problems that come up later, I'm\nnot going to buy your -- your retreat from Roberts.\nMR. FISHER: I see, Your Honor. I think that\nproper -- the proper test would be if -- if one of the two\npeople is so -- you know, is doing something with the\npurpose of understanding it's going to be used in a\ncriminal case, then we have a testimonial situation. I\nthink you -- this Court could say that, but it -- you have\nto look back --\nQUESTION: You mean either the speaker or the\nperson taking the statement. Is that what you're saying?\nI don't understand your response.\nMR. FISHER: I think certainly the speaker and I\nthink there may be situations -- and this is -- this is\nsomething the Court can deal with about when this -- about\nwhen the -- when the governmental officer is the only one\nand -- and is under such a circumstance that the\ngovernmental officer is molding the statement in such a\nway and molding what somebody is going to say --\nQUESTION: Well, you know, the concern we ought\nto have with your approach is we're going to get into some\nvery tricky questions if we go your route in deciding\nwhat's testimonial, and why buy a pig in a poke, in\neffect?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the first reason is because,\nas I said, if you have difficult cases out on the margin,\nI submit to the Court the Constitution could tolerate\nthat.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I think the professors there\nare thinking that isn't difficult. I think they're\nthinking it is the question of whether a reasonable person\nin the declarant's position would think it was likely that\nthis was going to be used in testimony because if you look\nto the position of the police, you will suddenly find that\ntape recorded informant testimony of an ongoing\nconspiracy, while they're planning to rob the bank, and\nsuddenly is kept out of court. And there is no reason.\nWe wouldn't keep it out of court today. It would be --\ncome in under the co-conspirator rule. So I think that\nthey wrote these words in this brief thinking about it,\nand now if we're suddenly going to go and -- and open this\nall up to a whole bunch of other things, I'd be a little\nnervous about it too.\nMR. FISHER: No, I'm sorry, Mr. -- Justice\nBreyer. I may have misunderstood partially the suggestion\n-- the hypothetical that I was getting. I think you're\ncorrect that the traditional kind of co-conspirator\nstatements under that kind of a situation would come in\nunder either approach. What I understood the hypothetical\nto be was a situation where somebody, after a conspiracy\nis done, is doing --\nQUESTION: It's your view that a co-conspirator\nstatement is not testimonial then?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's the ordinary course\nof events. Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Well, why is that if it meets the\ntest of a statement made to the police?\nMR. FISHER: Well, if there's an undercover\nofficer present, it meets -- it meets the -- the -- you\nknow, the test of a statement made to the police. But\nthen I think this is where the law professors have it\nright, and this is where I'm agreeing with Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Not -- you're right. It's not\nautomatically. Under the rule today, if it's a co-\nconspirator statement, right in the police station,\nbecause it's an ongoing coverup conspiracy, I guess it\nwould come in. But I think under the new rule, if in fact\neverybody in that room knows that it is likely to be used\nas a substitute for testimonial use at trial, it would not\ncome in. I think that's the point of the change.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and --\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how about a wire tap?\nYou've got a wire tap going, and you hear co-conspirators\non -- on the other end of the wire. Is that testimonial\nor not?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's the traditional kind\nof co-conspirator statement that is not covered by the\ntestimonial approach. And -- and I think --\nQUESTION: And under your approach it would come\nin without difficulty. It would not be testimonial. Is\nthat what you're saying?\nMR. FISHER: Without difficulty as to the\nConfrontation Clause, yes, Justice O'Connor.\nAnd I think it's important when we look at these\nhypotheticals to compare what we have on the other side\nwhen you look at the Roberts approach. Under the Roberts\napproach, no matter how much -- you know, if somebody\ngives an out-of-court affidavit, if somebody speaks ex\nparte to a grand jury, even if a witness takes the stand\nin the middle of a criminal trial -- in -- in a criminal\ntrial and puts blame directly on the defendant, and then,\nfor example, were to die or suddenly go missing, under\nRoberts you have the situation where the trial judge\ndoesn't strike the testimony, doesn't disallow it, but\nlooks to its reliability.\nAnd the odd thing -- and this is what I was\ngetting to earlier. Compared to what the State and the\nSolicitor General are proposing to you today, the odd\nthing is the more testimonial it is, the more it comes\nunder the core concern of the Confrontation Clause that\nstarted in Raleigh's trial and has moved all the way\nforward -- the more testimonial it is, the more likely\nit's pass -- it is to pass the Roberts test.\nQUESTION: Well, let's look at this very case\nand tell me whether the result is any different at the end\nof the day under Roberts versus your test.\nMR. FISHER: I think the answer is absolutely\nnot, Justice O'Connor. Under this Court's Wright opinion\n-- you know, the rationale for the lower court was\ninterlocking confessions. Under this Court's Roberts --\nI'm sorry. Under this Court's opinion in Wright, it is\nonly the inherent indicia of reliability surrounding a\nstatement not other evidence at trial that a judge can\nlook to. So --\nQUESTION: And therefore? I mean, relate it to\nthis case, if you would. Tell me whether the result would\ndiffer under your proposal and under Roberts in this very\ncase. Why don't you focus on the statement and tell us\nwhy it would or would not be different?\nMR. FISHER: It doesn't matter in this case,\nJustice O'Connor, for two reasons.\nFirst of all, because under Wright, you cannot\nlook to the defendant's confession in order to assess the\nreliability of Sylvia's statement, and that's what the\nWashington Supreme Court did.\nThe second reason is even if you could look to\nthat -- to the substantive evidence at trial, several\nother indicia showed that the statement here was\nunreliable. The -- the witness was drunk. She said she'd\nbeen in shock during the events. She gave two\ninconsistent statements within a 4-hour span. She was in\npolice custody after being told that it depended what she\ntold the officers as to whether or not she'd be allow to\nleave. So there are several, several reasons to believe\nthat the statement here --\nQUESTION: Is it --\nMR. FISHER: -- you know, is excludable under\nboth tests.\nQUESTION: Why is it excludable under your test?\nMR. FISHER: Well, under the testimonial\napproach, Mr. Chief Justice?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. FISHER: For the simple reason that she was\nin custody giving a statement, giving a confession or a --\nor a custodial examination to police officers knowing it\nwas going to be used in the criminal investigation.\nThat's the traditional -- it is -- is the most common --\nit is the core concern of the Confrontation Clause.\nQUESTION: How --\nMR. FISHER: It brings us all the way back to\nRaleigh's trial.\nQUESTION: How about a statement like in Mancusi\nor one of those cases where the witness is given prior\nrecorded testimony? There's been an opportunity to cross-\nexamine. The witness is presently dead or unavailable.\nDoes that come in under your system?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Mancusi\ncomes out exactly the same way, and here's why. And this\nshows why my test -- why the testimonial approach is\nactually quite narrow. All the testimonial approach says\nis the witness has to have had a chance to cross-examine\nthe witness.\nQUESTION: The defendant.\nMR. FISHER: If, when it comes time for trial --\nI'm sorry?\nQUESTION: The defendant.\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry. The defendant has to\nhave had a chance to cross-examine the witness. If trial\nrolls around and the witness is unavailable, through no\nfault of the parties, and there's been adequate cross-\nexamination, as in Mancusi and actually as in Roberts\nitself -- and -- and I actually --\nQUESTION: Cross-examination by the defendant,\nnot by somebody else.\nMR. FISHER: Right. The statement needs to be\ngiven in the defendant's presence with the defendant\nhimself having the opportunity to cross-examine.\nQUESTION: Would -- would your approach overrule\nInadi?\nMR. FISHER: No, I don't believe it does.\nQUESTION: So you wouldn't have to say -- show\nthat a particular declarant was unavailable.\nMR. FISHER: You would have to show that a\nparticular declarant is unavailable --\nQUESTION: Well, then --\nMR. FISHER: -- if it were a testimonial\nstatement. What -- what --\nQUESTION: Well, then how about a spontaneous\ndeclaration?\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's the kind of a thing\nthat's traditional hearsay. It's outside of the scope of\nthe phrase witness against. It's outside of the scope of\nthe testimonial approach.\nQUESTION: So it would come in under your\nsystem?\nMR. FISHER: An excited utterance comes out the\nsame way under --\nQUESTION: Without -- without having to show\nunavailability.\nMR. FISHER: Right. It's just purely a hearsay\nquestion, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.\nQUESTION: Because you say that's outside of the\nConfrontation Clause entirely, not lumping all of hearsay.\nI thought your whole point is we don't want to lump all of\nhearsay under the Confrontation Clause.\nMR. FISHER: That's exactly right. I'm sorry,\nJustice --\nQUESTION: But there's one aspect of this case\nthat before your time is up I hope you can enlighten me\non. The reason that this witness is unavailable is that\nthe defendant has exercised his right to prevent his wife\nfrom testifying against him. Is that correct?\nMR. FISHER: It's -- it's close, Justice\nGinsburg. Washington law renders as a default rule that a\nspouse is unavailable to testify against another spouse.\nMr. Crawford here declined to waive that privilege.\nQUESTION: All right. But because he could have\nnot asserted that or not waived it, why doesn't that carry\nover also? Why doesn't her immunity -- his control of\nwhether she can speak -- why doesn't that control as well\nthe use of the substitute for her testimony? If -- if\nthere is such a privilege, why doesn't it cover both her\nactual testimony in court and the substitute for that\ntestimony?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I mean, I think you're asking\nme as a Federal issue. As -- you know, as a State law\nissue, Washington State law has decided that the second --\nthat the out-of-court statement can come in. As a\nFederal --\nQUESTION: I just don't understand the logic of\nit.\nMR. FISHER: As a -- well, the reason -- you\ndon't understand the logic of the State law rule?\nQUESTION: The State -- yes, to say that he can\nkeep her off the stand, but he can't prevent a substitute\nfor -- for that statement --\nMR. FISHER: I agree, Justice Ginsburg. It is\n-- it is a somewhat odd State law rule. There's a --\nthere's a case called State v. Burden that the Washington\nSupreme Court held that the marital privilege applies just\nto the -- just to actually facing your spouse on the stand\nin the course of a trial because it -- you know, it helps\nyour spouse avoid the possibility of perjury and things\nlike that. And it said it doesn't apply to out-of-court\nstatements. I think you could make a very strong argument\nthat it ought to apply to both, but as a State law matter,\nthe Washington Supreme Court has said only in-court\ntestimony.\nUnless the Court has any further questions, I'll\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Fisher.\nMr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf the Court reaches the second question\npresented in this case, the United States submits that the\nConfrontation Clause should be properly construed to be\nlimited to testimonial statements and their functional\nequivalent, but it should not be an absolute bar against\nthe admissibility of that kind of statement.\nQUESTION: Well, you kind of want it both ways.\nIt's kind of an odd position. Has the Government taken a\ndifferent position on the testimonial aspect in the past?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice O'Connor. We took the\nsame position with respect to the limitation of the clause\nto testimonial statements in White v. Illinois, and this\nCourt rejected that submission by a 7 to 2 vote. We\nrenewed it in this case in light of the Court's grant of\ncertiorari on the second question presented in which the\npetitioner's position is that this Court has too broadly\nconstrued the Confrontation Clause, but within its\ncompass, it should be given an absolute prohibition.\nQUESTION: I don't -- I don't understand. You\n-- you say it's limited to testimonial statements. The --\nthe clause is limited to testimonial statements. However,\nit is not absolute.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Are there any other provisions that\nare in the Bill of Rights that are not absolute and can be\novercome by proof that the -- that the overall purpose of\nthe truth-serving function is -- is achieved? For\nexample, the right to jury trial. Do -- do we approach\nthat by saying, oh, in a really complicated case where a\njury would impede rather than facilitate the finding of\ntruth like, you know, a Sherman Act case, yes, it says\nthere's -- you're -- you're entitled to trial by jury, but\nthe whole purpose of it is to achieve truth, and where\nthat purpose wouldn't be served, let's forget about the\njury? We don't say that, do we?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia, but --\nQUESTION: Then why do we say it about the\nConfrontation Clause? And that -- that's essentially the\nGovernment's argument, that --\nMR. DREEBEN: The Court has said it about the\nConfrontation Clause --\nQUESTION: I know it has.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- in a variety of contexts.\nQUESTION: And -- and the issue here is whether\nwe -- we should retreat from those statements.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, starting from the overall\nstructure of the Sixth Amendment, the Court has construed\nmany of the rights in the Sixth Amendment not to be\nabsolute in certain contexts. The jury trial right does\nnot extend to all criminal prosecutions as the language of\nthe Constitution would provide. It does not -- the right\nto counsel does not extend to every criminal case in which\na -- arguably the text would require. The -- the\nCompulsory Process Clause has been held --\nQUESTION: That -- that's just a matter of\nlimiting the scope. The right to counsel. Do you have\nthe right to counsel for, you know, at -- at every moment\nduring -- during recesses in the trial and so forth?\nThat's -- that's just a matter of the scope of it, not a\nmatter of saying, yes, this is within the scope. This is\ntestimonial, but we nonetheless will not follow the\ncommand of -- of the constitutional provision that the\naccused is entitled to be confronted with the witnesses\nagainst him.\nMR. DREEBEN: What this Court has said about the\nConfrontation Clause is that it incorporated a preexisting\ncommon law right that had common law exceptions with it,\nand those common law exceptions were capable of growing\nand being developed along the lines of analogous\nprinciples.\nQUESTION: Growing and being developed so that\nthe -- the guarantee of confrontation is just a guarantee\nthat in the future we'll -- we'll leave it there if we\nthink it should be there.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not an absolute guarantee.\nWhat helps to, I think, explain that is to look at what\nconfrontation involves. It involves having a witness\nwho's under oath, who is subject to cross-examination,\nwho's demeanor can be observed by the jury, and who is\nbrought face to face with the accused. Now, this Court\nhas held in a number of cases that all or some of those\ncomponents of confrontation may be dispensed with when, in\nthe necessities of the case and in order to obtain witness\n-- witnesses who will be able to testify at the trial, it\nis required to do so.\nFor example, in the instance of former\ntestimony, you have oath, cross -- and cross-examination,\nand you have at one point the defendant face to face with\nthe witness, but you do not have the important\nconfrontation right of the jury having the opportunity to\nobserve the demeanor of the witness. And the Court held\nthat that is required because the necessities of the case\nrequire overcoming what would otherwise be a confrontation\nright.\nSimilarly in Maryland v. Craig, the Court held\nthat the literal face-to-face right to confront the\nwitness may be overcome by the necessities of the case.\nQUESTION: But then maybe your position is not\ndifferent from -- from theirs in this respect, if you take\nthe law professors'. If you say, as you do in your brief,\nthat it allows testimonial evidence in where the\ncircumstances are such that they serve the same underlying\npurpose as the Confrontation Clause, then all you're\nsaying is the same thing that they say here. Will the\naccused have had an adequate opportunity to confront the\nwitness? In other words, like a -- a prior trial. Is\nthat all you're saying? Because if that's so --\nMR. DREEBEN: No. It's definitely not what\nwe're saying, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: No, it certainly isn't. You're --\nyou're defining the underlying purpose much more broadly\nthan the law professors.\nMR. DREEBEN: We define the underlying purpose\nof the Confrontation Clause --\nQUESTION: To achieve the truth. And if there\nare other indicia --\nQUESTION: Oh, achieve the truth.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: To serve the truth-seeking mission\nof the --\nQUESTION: Sir Walter Raleigh -- if they came in\n-- Sir Walter Raleigh -- in fact, it is shown that all the\n-- the statements made out of court against Sir Walter\nRaleigh were made in front of 12 bishops, and at that time\nthat was a very, very good security that this was\ncompletely true. Twelve bishops who saw the thing and --\nand they, you know, go -- they say, absolutely accurate.\nIn -- in your opinion, that would then come in in Sir\nWalter Raleigh's own case.\nMR. DREEBEN: I doubt seriously that -- that Sir\nWalter Raleigh's case would come out differently under our\napproach. What we are talking about --\nQUESTION: In other words, Sir Walter Raleigh --\nit came out that they did introduce this thing. So you're\nsaying if we take -- if we take --\nMR. DREEBEN: The witnesses were available,\nJustice Breyer, in Walter Raleigh's case. And our\nposition on the availability of witnesses is that when\nthey are available, they should be brought in.\nQUESTION: You would overrule Inadi then?\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, definitely not, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Our view of Inadi is that the statements of co-\nconspirators made to each other out of court in connection\nwith the -- with the conspiracy are almost invariably non-\ntestimonial statements. There may be a few rare instances\nin which the co-conspirators are continuing the conspiracy\nand speaking to law enforcement, and in that context, in\nthe unlikely event that the United States submitted that\nthose statements were coming in for the truth of the\nmatter asserted and not because they were false, then\nperhaps there would be some issue about our approach. But\nin the vast majority of cases --\nQUESTION: Well, what about in this case?\nThere's a co-conspirator's statement.\nMR. DREEBEN: There was no suggestion in the\nlower courts that these two individuals were attempting to\nfurther the conspiracy or that there was a conspiracy\ngoing on at the time of the statements.\nQUESTION: Well, I was going to say there was no\nconspiracy found, was there?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's -- these -- these\nstatements were admitted, Justice Souter and Justice\nO'Connor, as statements against penal interest. And the\nbasis for the State court decision in letting them in --\nQUESTION: And not as a so-called interlocking\n-- well, it was an interlocking --\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. The -- the Confrontation\nClause --\nQUESTION: -- type of confession or something.\nMR. DREEBEN: The hearsay basis was statement\nagainst penal interests. The confrontation argument that\nwas accepted by the Washington Supreme Court was that the\nconfession of Sylvia Crawford interlocked, which meant\nthat it overlapped and paralleled the confession of\nMichael Crawford --\nQUESTION: But the Government doesn't endorse\nthat position, as I understand it.\nMR. DREEBEN: We do not endorse that position,\nJustice Stevens.\nQUESTION: What is your position as to what\nshould have happened with this statement?\nMR. DREEBEN: This statement should have been\nexcluded, Justice Kennedy. It -- first of all, we think\nthat under --\nQUESTION: Under Roberts --\nMR. DREEBEN: Under Roberts --\nQUESTION: -- as well as --\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- this theory.\nMR. DREEBEN: Under Roberts, as explicated in\nIdaho v. Wright, corroborating evidence that serves to\nshow the reliability of a particular statement is not an\nacceptable means of vindicating its admission under the\nConfrontation Clause.\nI can think of only two possible reasons why the\nconfession of the defendant when it interlocks with the\nstatement made out of court might be treated differently,\nand neither of those arguments seems to me to be valid.\nOne would be if, as a factual matter, the\ndefendant's own statements showed that the out-of-court\nstatement was reliable to a degree not found with any\nother corroborating evidence, and I don't think that\nthat's --\nQUESTION: Well, couldn't he be impeached with\nhis out-of-court statement?\nMR. DREEBEN: He certainly could and was\nimpeached with his out-of-court statements.\nAnd this brings me to the second reason, Chief\nJustice Rehnquist. The defendant can attack the\nreliability of his own out-of-court confession. He's not\nbound by some notion of estoppel that because he said it,\ntherefore it must be true. And the record in this case\nreflects that Michael Crawford attempted to present a\nself-defense at trial that was substantially more robust\nthan the statements that he made at the time. And under\nCrane v. Kentucky, this Court has held that a defendant\ncan attack the reliability of his own statements. So even\nif the statements did directly interlock, in the sense\nthat the defendant's statements matched the out-of-court\ndeclarant's statements, that would not render them per se\nreliable for confrontation purposes.\nQUESTION: But they didn't match, and that's the\noddest thing. On the key thing, the most important to the\ndefendant, he suggested that the -- the person he\nassaulted had reached for something before the assault.\nAnd her testimony -- or her statement is that it was only\nafter the defendant assaulted the victim that the victim\nreached in -- in his pocket. I don't see how those could\nbe said to interlock. They seem to clash with each other\non the key point in the case.\nMR. DREEBEN: And -- and the State made that\npoint in its rebuttal argument. So there -- there is\ncertainly ample basis for saying that under existing law\nthe statements do not come in.\nThe question for the Court is should the Court\nrevisit its Ohio v. Roberts jurisprudence because of the\nconcerns about whether Ohio v. Roberts was\nconstitutionally accurate.\nQUESTION: Well, concerns by whom?\nMR. DREEBEN: Concerns that I think are -- are\nraised by reading the Confrontation Clause as an original\nmatter before this Court's jurisprudence made all hearsay\nsubject to the Confrontation Clause.\nNow, we do not submit that there is a practical\nneed for the Court to revise its jurisprudence. The\nUnited States has not encountered a significantly\ndifficult burden in admitting evidence under the hearsay\nrules under the Roberts approach as -- as it has now been\narticulated. And we also acknowledge that the Court would\nhave to develop a jurisprudence to decide what testimonial\nstatements means, if the Court adopts the testimonial\napproach.\nWhat we do submit is that the way in which the\nword witness against is used in the Sixth Amendment,\nparticularly when read in light of the way the word\nwitness is used in the Fifth Amendment and also in the\nSixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause, that the word\nwitness was meant to refer to people who were giving\nevidence for purposes of a case, not to people who simply\nhappen to observe facts in the world and made statements\nabout them and that are now being used as hearsay in a\ncriminal trial.\nQUESTION: Do you think that developing a\njurisprudence to decide what constitutes testimonial\nstatements is any more difficult than developing a\njurisprudence to determine what are sufficient indicia of\nreliability to overcome the text of the Confrontation\nClause?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia. I think they\nboth involve certain challenges.\nWhat exists today is a body of law that has\nexamined the indicia of reliability question, and with\nrespect to certain statements in the testimonial category,\nsuch as victim statements to the police in a condition\nthat might be likened to an excited utterance or sometimes\nin statements in aid of medical diagnosis or treatment,\nand also true statements against penal interests such as\nguilty pleas by a defendant that does not implicate the\ndefendant on trial but simply acknowledges criminal\nconduct, the lower courts have concluded that those\nstatements do have sufficient indicia of reliability to be\nadmitted.\nAnd our concern is that if this Court were to\nadopt the testimonial approach, that it not do so in a way\nthat would foreclose lower courts from taking advantage of\nevidence that is reliable, unavailable from another\nsource, important in criminal prosecutions and well-\ngrounded in the theory of the Confrontation Clause as a\nvehicle for achieving truth in criminal trials.\nQUESTION: Why unavailable from another source?\nLet's say you have this -- this self-incriminating\nconfession, but the person is available. You could put\nhim on the stand to test whether that confession that he\nmade was true or false. Why -- where do you -- where do\nyou pull this requirement that -- that he be unavailable\nfrom? If indeed it doesn't violate the Confrontation\nClause because it's sufficiently reliable, why does he\nhave to be unavailable?\nMR. DREEBEN: Our position is that with respect\nto testimonial statements, the preference is to get live,\nin-court testimony with all of the benefits that the\nConfrontation Clause envisioned for testimony.\nBut sometimes a defendant who pleads guilty is\nstill awaiting sentencing, and as this Court held in\nMitchell v. United States, the defendant still has a Fifth\nAmendment privilege and can refuse to testify on grounds\nof privilege. Other defendants who plead guilty in their\nown cases will sometimes refuse to testify even on pain of\ncontempt, and at that point the choice for the judicial\nsystem is either admitting that's -- that evidence in the\ncriminal trial or excluding it altogether and risking a\nmanifest failure of justice because there isn't the\nevidence.\nAnd I think it's important to distinguish\nbetween those kinds of statements, the excited utterances,\n911 calls, true statements against penal interests that\nimplicate only one --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you --\nQUESTION: Mr. Sherman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN C. SHERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SHERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe State of Washington is asking the Court to\n-- I guess, to simply say -- excuse me -- retain the\nreliability framework of Ohio v. Roberts. Excuse me.\nThe -- the primary part of Ohio v. Roberts\nthat's important to the State is the reliability factor,\nand the reason that -- that that's important is because\nessentially Ohio v. Roberts recognizes that there are\nother rights and interests at stake in a criminal trial\nother than the defendant's confrontation rights. For\nexample, it recognizes that society as a whole has an\ninterest in seeing that criminal activity is properly\naddressed.\nQUESTION: We could have written it that way, I\nsuppose. I mean, the Confrontation Clause instead of\nsaying in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\nenjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses\nagainst him, we could have added, comma, unless there are\nother considerations.\nMR. SHERMAN: That's correct --\nQUESTION: It doesn't say that. It says in all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right\nto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\nMR. SHERMAN: That -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. And when I --\nQUESTION: Where -- I mean, I don't understand\nwhere we derive this permissibility of not allowing him to\nconfront the witnesses against him so long as we come to\nthe judgment that the evidence is inherently reliable.\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, Your Honor, I guess to\nanswer that question properly, I -- I'll speak to what I\nat least read and heard actually petitioner had in one of\nthe amici briefs concerning the -- the history surrounding\nthe Confrontation Clause and how we got to have the right\nto confrontation. And essentially what I -- I gleaned\nfrom that is there, at a point in time, was not a right to\nconfrontation, and over the course of centuries, the right\ndeveloped. But it appears to me that it developed based\n-- developed based upon really what public policy was,\nthat the -- the society would not tolerate the inequities\nof the systems that were in place that were denying\nconfrontation and felt that it was fair that this concept\nof confrontation take place.\nSo when the -- the Framers of the Constitution\nput that right into the Bill of Rights, it was based upon,\nin my view, their perception that the public policy that\ntheir society at that time wanted to recognize and make\neveryone know that they're retaining that to be their\nright.\nI don't think, though, that it would rationally\nfollow that -- that they intended that everything that\nthey said be written in stone and --\nQUESTION: No. That may be --\nQUESTION: It could be amended. It could be\namended. I mean, you know, there's an amendment provision\nin the Constitution, but -- but until it's amended, it --\nit does seem to say that in all criminal prosecutions, you\n-- you have the right to be confronted.\nMR. SHERMAN: And I would agree. And in fact, I\n-- I think one of the points that -- that I -- I want to\nmake is that a literal interpretation of the Confrontation\nClause bars the petitioner's proposal and the proposal of\namici and the proposal of the State to maintain the\nRoberts framework.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. SHERMAN: If you take literally the\nConfrontation Clause, I believe that it --\nQUESTION: It says witnesses, confront\nwitnesses. A witness is a person who testifies and I\ndon't see any literal problem there.\nMR. SHERMAN: I -- I believe that everyone that\ncomes and sits on the witness stand and says anything that\nis going to be used --\nQUESTION: A typical case that -- where it\nshould come in, but I guess under their proposal it would,\nand under the status quo it probably wouldn't. We have a\ncase of drug conspiracy. During the conspiracy, well\nbefore anybody is caught, they discover, through whatever\nmeans, that there's a cup on the mantel, a pewter cup,\nthat's filled with drugs. Who does it belong to? Does it\nbelong to the defendant? We have a witness who overheard\nthe defendant's wife shout out from the kitchen, Dink,\nhave you got your pewter cup? It's on the mantel. All\nright? Does that come in or not come in? Whether it does\nor not, it's not a Confrontation Clause question.\nYou say that we should make that into a\nconstitutional question. We should have all the\nconstitutional courts going into it or not?\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, I -- I respectfully disagree\nwith Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. SHERMAN: -- that it's not a Confrontation\nClause question.\nQUESTION: All right. You say it is. In other\nwords, every time that a -- that a -- a trial in any one\nof 50 million trials in the United States decides to admit\nsome hearsay, in principle, you go into habeas and the\nFederal judge has to decide whether that hearsay is or is\nnot, quote, reliable, end quote, for purposes of the\nConfrontation Clause. That's the present system.\nSo you're the prosecuting attorney. Correct?\nMR. SHERMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: You have experience in this area.\nTell me if this is right.\nWhat I would expect to have happen is that all\nthese habeas courts, when they get real hearsay, nothing\nto do with the trial, you know, real hearsay like I just\ntalked to you about, they'll find it reliable if the -- if\nthe -- if the State court admitted it.\nThen, however, they get to this kind of a case\nwhere the police were actually there writing out\naffidavits which they're going to introduce, and there\nwhat they'll say is, no, it's not reliable.\nSo in order to make the Roberts system work,\nwhat will happen is you have to have two ideas of\nreliability. Now, has that been a problem or am I just\nmaking that up? Because what they're saying is the\nRoberts thing makes no sense. If you take it seriously,\nit keeps out stuff that should come in and it lets in\nstuff that should stay out. And if you don't take it\nseriously, which is what must have happened, it just\nproduces a mess.\nMR. SHERMAN: To address the first part of your\nquestion, Your Honor, I believe what I was -- was\nattempting to say was that the Confrontation Clause,\nstrictly interpreted, it is going to not let any hearsay\nof any kind in. Yes, that is my position.\nQUESTION: You mean the -- the only kind of\nevidence that can become -- come in at a criminal trial is\nfrom a witness who's physically present in the courtroom.\nMR. SHERMAN: I believe that that would be a\nstrict interpretation of the Confrontation Clause, Your\nHonor.\nTo answer the second part of -- of your\nquestion --\nQUESTION: From your own experience. I'm quite\ninterested actually, if -- if you followed what I was\nsaying.\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, actually --\nQUESTION: You work in this area and I'd like\nyou --\nMR. SHERMAN: I do and -- and I can say from my\nexperience, I have had very few problems arise with\nConfrontation Clause principles under the Roberts\nframework. And -- and as a matter of fact, in 12 years of\npractice, this is the first time I've ever seen -- I've\nseen an interlocking confession come up.\nBut I think that the reason that --\nQUESTION: Do you think this was interlocking?\nMR. SHERMAN: I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, they certainly differed on a\nkey element. I'm not sure it would come in under Roberts.\nMR. SHERMAN: And, Your Honor, I -- I believe\nthat the court of appeals also, at least the majority of\nthat court, believed that there was a difference between\nwhat the -- Mr. and Mrs. Crawford were saying, but the --\nour supreme court looked more closely at the statements\nand observed that in fact they were saying the same thing.\nQUESTION: Wasn't the whole point of admitting\nit that -- that she had, in effect, said there -- there\nwas no weapon, the victim was not taking a weapon out, and\nthat was on the basis of her statement the prosecutor made\nexactly that argument? Wasn't that why it came in?\nMR. SHERMAN: No, not specifically that -- that\nshe said that he wasn't taking one out because clearly she\ndidn't say that. And if in fact that was the --\nQUESTION: Well, her description did not include\none. And -- and wasn't that the basis of the prosecutor's\nargument, that this wasn't self-defense?\nMR. SHERMAN: In part, and -- and -- but his\ndescription did not include a -- a weapon either. Both of\ntheir descriptions --\nQUESTION: No, but the implication of his\ndescription was that he reasonably thought something was\ncoming out and he then in one of his statements said, you\nknow, it was him or me. And the reason her statement was\nadmitted was that it was not congruent with that, that\nthere was no indication in her statement that a -- that a\n-- a weapon was being withdrawn. So at the -- I -- isn't\n-- isn't that the reason that the statement, for the\npurpose it was admitted, was not interlocking?\nMR. SHERMAN: I believe that that was that\nprosecutor's interpretation of -- of that evidence, and\nthat is in fact what he argued at trial. I think he was\nincorrect. I think that if you look at the statement, it\nvery -- Sylvia Crawford very clearly says that -- that the\nvictim appeared that he was reaching for something in his\npocket.\nQUESTION: After the assault.\nMR. SHERMAN: No, Your Honor, I respectfully --\nQUESTION: Why don't we look at this since the\ntestimony is there? I read it that way.\nMR. SHERMAN: And -- and, Your Honor, as I\nindicated, so did apparently my deputy prosecutor and so\ndid our court of appeals. Our -- our supreme court read\nit as -- as I am.\nQUESTION: But one of the worrisome things about\ntreating all these things as just hearsay reliability. I\ndon't understand how this testimony comes in. When the\nwoman testified -- when the woman said in her statement I\nwas drunk, I closed my eyes, how could that possibly be\nreliable?\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, she did say those things,\nbut she also said things that indicated that that was not\nquite -- quite correct. She also said, well, I saw\ncertain things going. I saw Michael stab the victim. I\nsaw the victim doing these --\nQUESTION: But she said at that time she had\nbeen drinking and she -- that happened before. I just\ndon't understand this reliability test that allows\nsomething to come in that doesn't coincide with what the\ndefendant himself said, and that the declarant is saying,\noh, I was scared. I closed my eyes.\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, and -- and I understand Your\nHonor's question and -- and position. One of the things\nthat obviously you can't get out of the flat piece of\npaper is -- is what her true condition was, and that is a\nproblem. But I don't recall her saying specifically that\nshe was drunk at the -- at the time, merely that she had\nbeen drinking and she indicated that Michael had been\ndrinking as well. But I don't know that --\nQUESTION: She did say that she shut her eyes\nand didn't really watch. Those were her words. I shut my\neyes and didn't really watch. How could such testimony be\nreliable?\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, because she at the same --\nin the same breath was able to accurately describe the\nsame events that Michael had described in his statement.\nQUESTION: But that's unreliable. I mean, you\nhave a witness who says two -- two opposite things. I saw\nthis, and on the other hand, I shut my eyes.\nMR. SHERMAN: And -- and I understand Your\nHonor's position on that. I -- I just respectfully\ndisagree. I don't think that those factors by themselves\nnecessarily render it to be unreliable.\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nQUESTION: But suppose we said it was\nunreliable. Let's suppose we held that. And in this case\nit goes out. All right. Now, so we've had a pretty tough\nstandard in your view of what counts as reliable and not.\nIt's been a pretty tough standard. It has to be really\nreliable.\nMR. SHERMAN: Right.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, what's going to happen\nwhen the courts, the Federal courts or the State courts,\napply that tough standard of reliability to hearsay\nstatements that have to do with the -- involved in the\ncommissions of the crime itself? In other words, not --\nnot when they're in the police station giving confessions,\nbut like the example I gave you with the cup.\nNow, suppose we apply the tough standard of\nreliability to those. Would that make a difference?\nWould they then start to be kept out because they violate\nthe Confrontation Clause?\nMR. SHERMAN: I think at -- at a certain point\nthe tougher you make the standards for hearsay to come in,\nthe fewer pieces of hearsay that are going to come in. I\ndon't think that that's necessary in this case because\nwhat -- if -- if we're simply talking about interlocking\nconfessions and whether such a thing exists and if they --\nas the question presents, if there will ever be such a\nthing as a confession that sufficiently interlocks so that\nit will be sufficiently reliable to be admitted or not,\nthe Court could simply say there's just never going to be\na situation that comes before us where they will interlock\nsufficiently and -- and be admittable -- admitted.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sherman, on this question of\ninterlock, I know we've referred to interlock in Bruton\ncases where they've got joint trials of the defendants and\nthat sort of thing. What is the strongest case you have\nfor the proposition that absent a joint trial, the\ninterlocking nature of a confession -- or a statement is\ncritical?\nMR. SHERMAN: I think it would be this case\nthat's before the Court today, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I see. So none of our precedents\nsupport that proposition.\nMR. SHERMAN: I think actually the only time\nthis Court has addressed the interlock theory on its\nmerits --\nQUESTION: Is in the Bruton-type --\nMR. SHERMAN: -- was in Lee v. Illinois when it\nwas simply the issue of the interlocking confession and\nthere wasn't any side issues of co-defendants in the same\ntrial or any of those other issues.\nQUESTION: But -- but we have said in other\ncases that the reliability, which -- which Roberts insists\nupon, has to be established from the statement itself and\nnot from other statements. Right?\nQUESTION: Which would seem to exclude\ninterlock --\nQUESTION: Interlocking confessions. That's the\nproblem I have with it. We -- we haven't had such a case,\nbut the standard that we expressed in Roberts would seem\nto exclude interlocking confessions as establishing\nreliability.\nMR. SHERMAN: And if Roberts were the only case\nthat -- that the Court were to look at, that I think would\n-- I would agree that would be the case. But in Lee v.\nIllinois, I think this Court very clearly accepted --\ninterpreted the concept of interlocking confessions, and\nthereafter in Cruz v. New York. But in Lee, the Court\nactually set forth a test to be used -- at least in\nEarnest v. New Mexico, the Court called it a test -- but a\ntest to be used in determining when an interlocking\nconfession can be admitted. Now, that followed Roberts.\nQUESTION: But wasn't that a joint trial? I\ncan't remember for sure.\nMR. SHERMAN: I don't believe that Lee was a\njoint trial, Your Honor. In fact, I think in -- Lee was a\ncase in which the Court -- this Court determined that the\nconfessions did not sufficiently interlock to make them\nreliable to be admitted, and also there was --\nQUESTION: I thought Lee involved co-\ndefendants.\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, I -- I believe there -- I\ndon't -- I don't recall there being co-defendants at\ntrial, and I may be mistaken about that. My recollection\nis that the -- the two holdings of Lee were, one, that --\nthat they couldn't be corroborated by other evidence; and\ntwo, that the confessions simply weren't sufficiently\ninterlocking. And I may be mistaken. I just -- I'm not\nrecalling there being co-defendants tried at the same time\nin that particular case.\nBut my point being that Lee, of course, came\nafter Roberts and, in my mind, established a third way of\n-- third form of -- of determining reliability that was\nseparate from what was in Roberts. Roberts had your\nindicia of reliability and your well-founded hearsay\nexception, and then in Lee it's my perception that this\nCourt formed a third test, that being the interlocking\nconfession rule test, and that --\nQUESTION: But the bottom line was that it --\nthat that test was not met in the case, that there wasn't\na sufficient interlock.\nMR. SHERMAN: That -- that wasn't met in the Lee\ncase, and that was the decision of the court of appeals in\nthis case. And it was our supreme court that reversed\nthat and said, no, we believe that they did sufficiently\ninterlock.\nQUESTION: I thought that what we said in Lee\nwas simply that assuming that an interlocking confession\nexception exists, this didn't meet it. I -- I don't know\nthat we -- that -- that we spoke as though there was such\nan exception. We just said assuming it does exist, the\nfacts here don't -- don't meet it. Isn't that what the\ncase held?\nMR. SHERMAN: I think perhaps. I -- I know that\nin the very least the Washington State Supreme Court\ninterpreted it to be a test, and I know that in Earnest v.\nNew Mexico, this Court called it a test for determining\nwhen interlocking confessions can come in. So taking it\nfrom both of those cases, the Washington Supreme Court in\nthe very least determined that it was a test, and in fact,\nin I believe it's State v. Rice said we adopt this new\ntest from -- from Lee v. Illinois as to interlocking\nconfessions.\nQUESTION: I thought actually that there were\nfive members of the Court in Lee v. Illinois to say that\nconfessions of a co-defendant are presumptively unreliable\nfor purposes of Roberts.\nMR. SHERMAN: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that even if there was a so-\ncalled interlocking confession exception, it wasn't met in\nthat case.\nMR. SHERMAN: And -- and I can understand that\ninterpretation. I -- it just -- I'm -- I'm certain that\nit's not the interpretation that the Washington State\nSupreme Court made, and in fact, most courts --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe they better re-read it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHERMAN: That's entirely possible, Your\nHonor, and I'm certain that after today, they will -- they\nwill do so.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHERMAN: The point -- but the point being\nthat if there is not an interlocking confession rule, then\nthere is not. If this Court says we -- there will never\nbe a situation where one co-defendant's confession,\nregardless of how identical it is to the defendant's, will\never be reliable enough, then so be it. Then we'll have\nthat test. It will be straightforward and can be applied\naccordingly.\nThat, in all candor, is the lesser of the\nState's concerns in this coming -- in this case coming\nbefore this Court today, the primary concern of the State\nactually being that this Court retain the reliability\nstandard of -- of State -- of Ohio v. Roberts for a\nvariety of reasons that relate essentially to, as I\nindicated earlier, this underlying recognition that there\nare simply other interests at stake other than the\ndefendant's that really need to be addressed.\nQUESTION: Why should the Court retain it when\nthis very case gives us an example of how arbitrary that\ndetermination is made whether it's reliable? When a court\ncan call something -- a witness -- a declarant in the\nshape this one was and say that's reliable, shouldn't that\nmake us worry about using that test?\nMR. SHERMAN: Well, I have to say that I don't\nthink this Court or any court can make a test that is not\ngoing to have some problems, and in fact, both the\npetitioner and the learned professors admit that their\nsystem have -- has problems too. Any system is going to\nhave problems. The bugs are going to have to be worked\nout. It'll take years of -- of cases, and the -- and the\nreality is -- and I, of course, mean no disrespect to any\njudge -- anytime you get -- you have a judge making a\ndiscretionary decision, on the same set of facts there's\nsimply going to be some judges that will make exactly\nopposite decisions based upon the same set of facts.\nThat's just human nature.\nIn this case -- and the point that I'm trying to\nmake is that Ohio v. Roberts is a known quantity, it's a\nknown entity. I haven't experienced any problems with its\napplication personally or in cases that have been\naddressed at my office since I've been there. A new\nsystem that is proposed by the petitioner and the amici\nsimply fails to take into consideration, as this Court did\nin Ohio v. Roberts, that there are other rights and other\ninterests that are involved in a criminal case. It\ndoesn't address problems concerning witnesses that become\nunavailable through no fault of the State. Yet, why\nshould society suffer to have a criminal defendant\nreleased simply because a witness has become unavailable?\nAnd you know, you can't always prove a defendant\nhas made a witness unavailable. That is a really tough\nstandard.\nThere are similar other cases where particularly\nyoung witnesses, who are perfectly capable of telling you\nexactly what happened to them or what they've seen in a\nnonconfrontational setting, but yet, because of either\nfear or intimidation, they are simply unable to come into\ncourt and testify in front of a bunch of strangers or in\n-- probably in front of the very person who is alleged to\nhave victimized them. They're not going to be able to say\na thing. Yet, there needs to be some way to get what they\ncan say in front of a jury. I -- I think that any system\nthat prohibits that is just going to be contrary to the\ninterests of society in general and to the interests of\nthe other parties that -- that are involved in the trial\nother than the defendant.\nAnd if there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sherman.\nMr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI think it's important to concentrate in\nrebuttal on the State's suggestion and the Solicitor\nGeneral's suggestion to retain the reliability prong of\nthe Roberts framework.\nThe Solicitor General agrees with us that the\nhistory of the -- that -- that you ought to be looking to\nhistory here, and the history on this point is crystal\nclear. From Rex v. -- Rex v. Paine in 1696, other English\ncases before the Constitution, and then this Court's cases\nafter the Constitution was adopted, principally Kirby and\nMattox, and all the way through Douglas, the -- when the\nsituation arose that a witness was unavailable, the rule\nwas clear if the -- if -- if the statement was\ntestimonial, given to the authorities, it had to be\nexcluded. And it's not -- and the -- and the balance was\nstruck by the Framers not -- not just because of these\npublic policy considerations, but because of the Framers\nwere insisting upon an adversarial method of giving\ntestimony. And when the Framers decided, when that was\nnot present, that we were simply not prepared to -- to\nadmit the testimony.\nAnd so what we have is we have a clear rule\nuntil at least the 1970's that reliability doesn't matter.\nAnd the only time reliability -- first was adopted by this\nCourt. The only time it became important was in Dutton v.\nEvans when you had a non-testimonial statement, and then\nin Roberts when this Court created a general framework\nthat it allowed reliability, all of a sudden, be into play\nwhen we were stretching the Confrontation Clause in our\nview too far.\nBut once you bring the Confrontation Clause back\nto the proper scope, as we're asking you to do and the\nSolicitor General is asking you to do, there's really no\nreason anymore to -- to keep the reliability prong. The\nreliability prong was -- was adopted by this Court to deal\nwith the problem of hearsay that was coming outside the\ntestimonial type setting. Once you -- once you read it --\nread that problem away, we're back to the original\nunderstanding of the Confrontation Clause.\nAnd the reason that you ought to stick with that\n-- Justice Ginsburg I think put the nail on the head when\nshe said the reason we're here today is that you have a --\nyou -- you have -- what you have now is a system where\ntrial judges can reach almost any conclusion they want.\nThat's shown in our briefs. The Solicitor General doesn't\neven describe to you how reliability -- doesn't even\ndefend reliability findings in light of all the briefing\nby -- by the petitioner and by amici.\nAnd so I think that when you look at that, you\nshow that the very concern that gave rise to Raleigh trial\n-- and I would say parenthetically that I believe Lord\nCobham was unavailable in the trial. That's what the\ntranscript says. And the very problem was that trial\njudges could do these reliability determinations in place\nof -- of a clear rule of when testimony could be given.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Fisher.\n"
