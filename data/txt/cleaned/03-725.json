BRILL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMS. BRILL: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThere are five primary reasons why this\nprosecution is outside the scope of anything Congress has\nauthorized. First, the government's interpretation of the\nwire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule.\nSecond, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by\nallowing the Government to incarcerate petitioners for 57\nmonths for conduct that has never given rise to civil\nliability in this country. Third, this prosecution\ncontravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity\nin matters of international tax enforcement. Fourth, the\nGovernment acknowledged below that it cannot bring this\nprosecution without disregarding another act of Congress,\nthe Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the\nname specifies, mandatory. And, fifth, under this Court's\ndecisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute\napplies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into\nrelinquishing something that it holds as money or\nproperty. A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax\nclaim is neither money nor property.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, can you look at the\ninterest of the Government as one of not allowing U.S.\nterritory to be used to carry out a smuggling scheme? I\nmean, why does it have to be viewed as one of trying to\nenforce some other nation's tax laws?\nMS. BRILL: Justice O'Connor, the government's\ninterest in prosecuting somebody does not define the scope\nof what the statute at issue proscribes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's a wire fraud statute\ndealing with the use of communications capacity in this\ncountry to carry out a scheme designed to enable smuggling\nof goods.\nMS. BRILL: Well, if the -- if the statute was\nnot written as it is -- the statute, as written, uses the\nwords \"defraud\" and the word -- the word \"property,\" and\nboth of those terms are terms that this Court has defined\nvery narrowly. In Nader, it defined a \"fraud\" as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Brill, I thought your brief\nsaid that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is\ndirected precisely against smugglers, but it only applies\nto those countries that have similar protection for us.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And Canada does not.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, Justice Scalia, that's exactly\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The existence of that\nstatute would seem to suggest -- and a statute which is\nlimited to countries that will do the same for us -- would\nseem to suggest that we don't want to do this for Canada.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, that's exactly -- that's\nexactly right, Your Honor. There --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's also limited to\nvessels. It's smuggling by water, not smuggling by --\nMS. BRILL: By automobile.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- vehicles, as was done here,\nso that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on\nland.\nMS. BRILL: Right. Yes, Your Honor, that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there something better about\nreciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land\nsmuggling?\nMS. BRILL: I think it just evinces what\nCongress was concerned about most at the time, Justice\nScalia, but it was -- it is certainly the case that in any\n-- any time that this country has endeavored to deal with\nmatters of international tax enforcement, it has always\ndemanded reciprocity. It has done so through the\nsmuggling statute, it has done so through the numerous tax\ntreaties that the Second Circuit's RJR decision discusses\nat length.\nAnd one of the points the RJR decision makes is\nthat, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking\nat the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was,\nat the same time, becoming concerned that this country had\ngone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with\nits tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of\ncutting back on the degree to which we would assist other\ncountries in tax enforcement.\nAnd so the issue is to look at -- that the\nrevenue rule must be used as a background principle of\ncommon law against which -- against which the revenue --\nexcuse me, against which the wire fraud statute is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we don't view\nthis case as involving some attempt to indirectly enforce\nCanada's tax laws -- suppose we don't view it with that\nlens -- then does that put it outside the so-called\nrevenue --\nMS. BRILL: Well, if it were not -- if it did\nnot serve the function -- it doesn't matter what the\ngovernment's intent is and what is in the mind of the\nprosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing\na foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would\nbe outside; but there are numerous ways in which this\nprosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue\nrule. Certainly, it deters future violations. The\nsentence was based on the -- an estimate of the intended\nloss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in\nCanada to determine what the amount was that was owed.\nAnd so the District Court became, essentially, part of the\ntax enforcement apparatus of the Government of Canada by\nperforming that assessment in the first instance.\nAnd so anytime that we impose criminal or civil\nliability in a manner that affects the tax policies of\nanother country, we are enforcing that rule. If we --\nwhether we're requiring compliance with the -- with the\ntax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance.\nAll of those --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the rationale for the rule\nthat enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to\nminimize the exposure to -- of our judges so that they --\nthe only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that --\nthat are paid to our own Government? I'm serious about\nthat. Is that the rationale?\nMS. BRILL: Well, I think there's a certain\namount of self-protection in some of the decision --\ndecisions, surely; but the real -- the underlying purpose\nof the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign -- that\ntaxes, in general, are a matter of policy. They're\ninherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or\nother kinds of commerce. They do not -- they do not\nassist in resolving disputes between private parties. And\noften they're imposed -- especially customs duties, are\nimposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts\nhave said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve\nonly the interest of the -- of the foreign sovereign, and\nthere's a particular -- there's been a particular\nsensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws,\npotentially declaring them invalid under the foreign\ngovernments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution.\nAnd so revenue rules have historically been a categorical\nexclusion to general principles of comity through which we\nmight otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign\njudgments.\nAnd the rule has come to be so entrenched, and\nhas been so well established, that there's a whole body of\nbackground law in the tax treatise of our country, and of\nmany other countries, that is based on our non-recognition\nand our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we did -- if we did\nenforce even a tax judgment of another country, there\nwould be no U.S. law that would be violated. You're\ntalking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes\nof another. But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign\nRelations now, that's put in terms of -- there's no\nrequirement that any country enforce the tax claims or\njudgments of another; but neither is there any\nprohibition.\nMS. BRILL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the current\nrestatement is worded in -- addresses judgment\nspecifically. It does not -- it doesn't address un-\nadjudicated tax codes. But there's always been a much\ngreater suspicion, a much greater reluctance, to get into\nenforcing a claim brought by a foreign country, where that\ncountry's own processes have not been allowed to run their\ncourse and to have the initial determination.\nThere -- the restate -- the second Restatement\nof Foreign Relations law, which is -- was -- came out in\n1965 and is closer to reflecting what the law was at the\ntime Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, says, in\nSection 41, Comment L, \"Under the -- under the foreign\nrelations law of the United States, courts in the United\nStates will generally refrain from taking action to give\neffect to the penal or revenue laws of other states,\nexcept as provided by international agreement.\" And so\nthat -- that was a statement by the -- by the propounders\nof the -- of the Restatement of what they -- what they\nbelieved the law was at the time.\nTo the extent it's qualified, I think it's\njust to leave room for the fact that the Senate can\npromulgate treaties, or Congress can, by statute, command\nthat courts recognize these laws. But it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't assert\nthat this -- that it -- that this couldn't be done.\nYou just --\nMS. BRILL: Not that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- assert that we shouldn't\ninterpret this statute to have done it.\nMS. BRILL: Exactly, Justice Scalia. If\nCongress had written a different wire fraud statute that\nhad said, \"You can't have a scheme to defraud the revenue,\nwhether foreign or domestic,\" that would have been a clear\nstatement abrogating the revenue rule. But we don't have\nany such clear statement, and the terms -- the terms\n\"defraud\" and the terms \"property\" have to be read with\nthe background rule in mind.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you would come to that\nconclusion even if we had a reciprocal enforcement\nagreement. If this were Country X, where we did have a\nreciprocal enforcement agreement, you'd come to the same\nconclusion, no prosecution under this statute.\nMS. BRILL: Correct, Your Honor, because there\nwouldn't -- this statute wouldn't have been written to\ntake that into account. This --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in a sense, the revenue\nposition is irrelevant to your -- to your secondary or\nyour -- or your independent argument on statutory\nconstruction. The revenue rule is irrelevant to it.\nMS. BRILL: As to just whether an unassessed tax\nclaim --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMS. BRILL: -- is property, the revenue rule --\nthe revenue rule adds a boost to it, but there are two --\nthere are two dimensions to the property element. One is\nthat, as I said -- and if a -- if a tax claim is not --\nhas not been subject to an assessment, that whatever\ninterest the Government may have in that is not in the\nnature of property; it is simply in the nature of law-\nenforcement power to collect. They -- some of these\nrevenue rule cases talk about the power to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So tax revenues are not\nproperty, in your view?\nMS. BRILL: Once a tax is collected, once the\nGovernment actually has money in its hands, and if there's\na scheme to, let's say, obtain an illegal refund through a\ntax and -- that would be a scheme to deprive a government\nbody of money. But a scheme to merely evade paying a tax\nis not something that falls within the statute, separate\nand apart from the revenue rule. But the revenue rule --\nas a result of the revenue rule, it is also the case that\nno state court would have recognized any property interest\nin a foreign sovereign, even if it had reached the point\nof a judgment. And so it works in both ways. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, Ms. Brill,\nsomething that puzzled me about this case? It is a rather\npeculiar use of our wire fraud statute. Are there any\nproceedings going on in Canada? Has there been any\nattempt to extradite these people?\nMS. BRILL: Justice Ginsburg, there was an\nindictment that Canada issued against the Petitioners. It\nhas charges under -- for smuggling, under Canadian law,\nwhich is Customs Act, Section 159. It charges unlawful\npossession of imported spirits under Excise Act 163(1)(b),\ndisposing of goods illegally imported, in violation of\nCustoms Act, Section 155. So Canada has its own process.\nThere has -- there has not been, to my\nknowledge, any request by Canada for extradition, but the\ntreaty between the United States and Canada does include\nrevenue violations, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Presumably, if we punish this\nperson this way, Canada wouldn't -- there's no double\njeopardy, right?\nMS. BRILL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we'd be punishing this\nperson for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would\npunish this person for violating Canadian law.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, I haven't looked in detail at\nthe statute of limitations provisions, but that could be\nthe effect. And we could be punishing them much more\nseverely than Canada would be. They have their own means\nof balancing what they think the appropriate balance is\nfor these things, and certainly the wire fraud statute, 57\nmonths in our --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think the Government\nhas an interest in saying, \"Look, if you're going to\nsmuggle, have your scheme up there in Canada; don't use\nour wire systems for fraudulent purposes. We don't like\nthat here.\"\nMS. BRILL: And if they want to pass a law that\nsays that, because of the -- because there's a domestic --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they -- of course, they\nsay that this covers it, and it seems to me that really\nthe -- that turns on the definition of \"property\" --\nMS. BRILL: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which is an arguable point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the -- instead of a\nwire fraud case, it was assault and battery? Supposing\nthe Canadian revenue agent got inside of New York and one\nof your clients beat him up, would we have -- solely\nbecause he was mad at him for trying to interfere with his\nattempt to smuggle into Canada -- would we have to say\nthat you can't do that, we have no jurisdiction over the\nassault and battery?\nMS. BRILL: No, Justice Stevens. It's -- the\nquestion is whether you're --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The only purpose would be just\nwhat the purpose is here, they're trying to facilitate the\nsmuggling operation.\nMS. BRILL: Well, the assault and battery --\nwhatever the assault and battery provisions are, you would\nbe bringing the prosecution solely for that purpose; it\ndoes not have any -- the effect of applying the assault\nand battery statute, if there was one --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is to interfere with Canadian's\ncollection of their taxes. That's the only reason for it.\nMS. BRILL: Well, I think it -- in that case, it\nwould be -- it would be far too attenuated to reach that\nconclusion. There could be -- the motive of a person --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that any more\nattenuated than a conspiracy carried out down here in\nMaryland using American assets to do the evil deed in\nCanada?\nMS. BRILL: Well, the motive of the person\nperforming the assault and battery would be irrelevant to\nthe prosecution. It's whether they intended to do the\nimproper touching and, in fact, carried it out.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't the motive\nirrelevant here? We don't want our facilities to be used\nfor criminal activity.\nMS. BRILL: The question is whether --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Any more than in the -- in\nthe hypothetical we don't want citizens beaten up on our\nsoil.\nMS. BRILL: Justice Kennedy, the issue is\nwhether -- is what Congress had in mind in enacting the\nwire fraud statute. And, in general, we presume that\nCongress had domestic concerns in mind, not that we have\nincorporated vast bodies of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it used broad\nlanguage, \"Any scheme to defraud by means of wire\ncommunications in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\nMS. BRILL: The wire -- it is -- the wire\ncommunications may be an interstate or foreign commerce,\nthe word \"any\" modifies \"any scheme or artifice to\ndefraud\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This statute applied against\npeople who defraud the United States Government in taxes?\nMS. BRILL: Your Honor, the government's\nposition on that, I believe, is somewhat inconsistent.\nThe tax -- the tax division and the Department of Justice\nU.S. Attorneys manual specifies that it is -- they believe\nit is the intent of Congress that tax matters will be\ndealt with through the internal revenue code, not through\nother means.\nThere are -- there have been some prosecutions\nbrought in the case of an illegal -- an illegal tax\nshelter, where there is truly an -- a private party who is\ndefrauded into giving up money in connection with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't -- you don't know\nof any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving\nthe Federal Government of property.\nMS. BRILL: Well, the Henderson case, which we\nhave cited in our reply brief, is one from the Southern\nDistrict of New York, where Judge Weinfeld said, when\nfaced with a mail fraud prosecution of that type, this is\noutside the scope of anything that Congress intended.\nThe -- I would like to get back to the issue of\nmoney or property so that it -- to have it conceptually\nwhy an unassessed tax claim is not money or property.\nThere is no allegation that -- in the indictment or\nanywhere -- that the petitioners took any money out of\nCanada's treasury. So money is not an issue. At most, it\nwas an effort to evade Canada's right to collect money,\nnot any money it had --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You could say the same\nthing if it were a building fraud. Suppose there were\ncontractors building a Canadian building for the Canadian\nGovernment and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and\nit was to deprive the Canadian Government of money? I\nthink the statute would clearly apply.\nMS. BRILL: The statute only applies -- what\nMcNally said is, any assistance a governmental body\nobtains from the statute must be in the capacity of\nproperty-holder. And so the -- a scheme to defraud\nsomebody out of their -- out of a building, that's\ntraditional property. There's not -- it is not the same\nthing.\nLet's have an -- let's take an example of an\ninterference with prospective economic advantage. So\nthere is a defendant who says to somebody else who's about\nto get a contract -- I know my competitor is about to get\na contract, and I say, \"Why don't you go out of town?\nThere's a -- there's a much bigger contract that you can\nget if you fly to Michigan.\" And, meanwhile, I go in, and\nI usurp the contract and take it for my own purposes.\nWell, I've interfered with that person's prospective\neconomic advantage, and so there would be a tort, and the\nperson could collect from me. But I have not taken any\nmoney or property from that person that was in his\npossession.\nAnd what McNally and Cleveland point us to is\nwhether there was money or property in the hands of the --\nof the victim. And Canada's interest -- until there has\nbeen an assessment, Canada's interest is purely that of a\n-- of a sovereign. It is -- it does not have a claim to\nany money that is in the bank account of somebody who owes\nit a debt.\nAnd the Johnston case, which we've cited in our\nreply brief, Your Honor, talks about -- this Court talked\nabout a statute in which there was a boxing promoter who\ncollected fees for the boxing match and also collected\ntaxes at the same time. And the U.S. Government could not\nbring an embezzlement action against that person for not\npaying the taxes, because those taxes were not -- were not\nyet anything that qualified as governmental property.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Brill, in the Court of\nAppeals, they treated the argument that this was not\nproperty as entirely separate from the revenue rule\nquestion. And I thought your petition for cert was\nconfined to the first question.\nMS. BRILL: Well, Your Honor -- no, Your Honor,\nwe talked about both in the petition for cert. And in\nthe question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the question, itself,\ndoesn't refer to the property issue.\nMS. BRILL: It talks about the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it -- was it phrased the\nsame way it is in your brief, in the petition?\nMS. BRILL: Yes. Yes, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then the last part of it\n--\nMS. BRILL: Right, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- obviously covers it.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, the last part talks about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, I see. I'm sorry, you're\nright. Yeah.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, okay.\nBut to return -- to return to the revenue rule\n-- and thank you, Justice Stevens, for bringing me back to\nthat -- the Government has acknowledged that there can be\nno restitution here. And that's in -- that's in the joint\nappendix, at page 106. They expressly waived it. They\nsaid that even if there was a foreign judgment that\nCanada was trying to bring here, that would be\nunenforceable. There could be no RICO actions, because\nthat's unenforceable; and no proxy suits on behalf of a\nforeign government. And so the only thing that they say\nis, beyond -- is not included -- the only act of\nenforcement which they say is not included is, somehow,\ncriminal enforcement.\nAnd under Section 14 of the -- excuse me, under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution, Congress has power to enforce that\namendment, and it has done so both in enacting statutes\nfor civil recovery, as well as criminal recovery --\ncriminal punishment, excuse me. And so it's -- the notion\nthat somehow incarcerating someone is not -- is not\npunishment is not something that makes much sense in that\ncontext.\nThe decisions of this Court have held that\npenalties are -- monetary penalties count as punishment,\nand also that injunctions are -- fall within the scope of\nthe revenue rule. That's in the Wisconsin versus Pelican\nInsurance case, which actually addresses the penal -- the\npenal rule, which is the close corollary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, when -- now\nthat we're getting into money, one of the things that the\nsentencing court had to do was to find out how much of a\nloss there was, and that involved determining what taxes\nwould be due under Canadian law. And did that increase\nthe sentence? Did the -- did the sentence vary with the\namount of taxes that they -- we found due?\nMS. BRILL: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it very much\ndid. The loss calculation was based on intended loss, and\nso they -- what the District Court judge did was estimated\nthe number of cases of liquor that were intended to be\nbrought into Canada, and applied that number to the amount\nof the tax that Canada, he believed, would have applied to\nthat -- to that amount. And that ended up changing the\nsentence from six months to, in the case of the\nPasquantino brothers, 57 months, and the -- and, in the\ncase of Mr. Hilts, 21 months. So the bulk of the sentence\nwas based on the Canadian tax law and our courts making\nthat assessment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A judge making that\nassessment.\nMS. BRILL: The judge made the sentence -- made\nthe assessment at sentencing, yes. What the -- what the\n-- what the Government did in this case was to submit,\nvery self-consciously, all of the issues of Canadian tax\nlaw to the jury. And the Assistant U.S. Attorney said\nthis to the Fourth Circuit en banc panel several times,\nthat they were presenting these matters of Canadian tax\nlaw as factual issues for the jury to find. But,\nultimately, in sentencing, it was -- it was the court that\nended up imposing and elevating that sentence.\nIf there aren't further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nA prosecution for wire fraud based on defrauding\na foreign government of taxes serves at least four\ndistinct United States prosecutorial interests.\nThe first is that the creation of schemes to\ndefraud frequently spawns collateral criminal conduct in\nthe United States above and beyond the fraudulent scheme\nitself. Here, for example, one of the defendants was\ncharged in the indictment with using a gun in relation to\nthe charged wire fraud scheme.\nSecond --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where? Using a gun where?\nMR. DREEBEN: In the United States, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why didn't you prosecute\nhim for that?\nMR. DREEBEN: That crime depended upon the\nvalidity of the wire fraud charges, because the crime was\nuse of a gun during in relation to this wire fraud\nscheme.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that really doesn't get you\nanywhere, does it? I mean, if the United States says, \"We\ndon't want this gun offense to be prosecuted unless\nthere's a wire fraud prosecution,\" that doesn't tell you\nanything as to whether there ought to be a wire fraud\nprosecution.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, what it tells you, Justice\nSouter, is why the United States has an interest in\nenforcing a law that facially is written to cover schemes\nto defraud that are carried out using the United States\nwires.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- but that's a\nreason for extending the statute to everything, to\neverything --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- reading \"property\" to mean\nanything at all. I mean, what you're saying is, the broader\nyou read this statute, the more bad guys we're going to\ncatch. I'll stipulate that. Of course it's true.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I'm starting\nfrom the proposition that the language of the wire fraud\nstatute textually applies to this scheme, and Petitioner's\nargument is that, because of the common law revenue rule,\nthe statute should be read to exclude schemes to defraud a\nforeign government of tax revenue. And the fact that a\nforeign government is defrauded of tax revenue does not\nmean that the United States does not have an independent\ninterest in rooting out that scheme and prosecuting it.\nIn addition to the collateral criminal conduct\nthat such schemes can spawn, the creation of such schemes\nindicates a criminal mind and a criminal group that can\nturn its techniques for used -- using to smuggle into\nCanada, also to smuggle back into the United States or to\nvictimize other victims in the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about evading a Cuban tax\nlaw that we think -- that many people would think is an\nunjust tax law? I mean, one of the things I'm worried\nabout is that this gets us into foreign policy. Are you\nsure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of\nforeign countries through this fraud statute, no matter\nwhat those tax laws happen to be?\nMR. DREEBEN: The United States has\nprosecutorial discretion to determine when to invoke the\nstatute and in what interests it should be served.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may well, but when it comes\nhere, this Court is going to have to decide -- we'll just\napprove whatever you want to prosecute and let you not\nprosecute whatever you want?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is no provision in the\nstatute, Justice Scalia, for this Court to second-guess\nforeign-policy determinations that are made --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, not just foreign policy.\nThe White Russians come here because they don't want to\npay Lenin's taxes designed to equalize all individuals, in\nterms of property. Country A has a tax law that makes\neverybody a criminal because nobody really ever pays all\nthe taxes. Country C has a set of laws that tax bibles.\nCountry D has a -- I mean, you know, we can spin out the\nexamples endlessly, and they're not farfetched.\nSo take all the arguments from last week, called\n\"any court arguments,\" cross- -- or two days ago -- just\nlet's cross-reference them. The problem is complexity of\ntax law. The problem is many, many, many would be\ncontrary to American policy. And the problem is, nobody\nreally knows what they are; indeed, they don't even know\nwhat American tax law is, no single individual, I suspect.\nLet's put in Italy, France, Byelorussia, Belarus, Ukraine,\nSaudi Arabia, and 35,000 others. Everybody becomes a\ncriminal. And then we say, \"Don't worry, we'll only\nprosecute the real bad ones.\" That's the argument, I\nthink, on the other side, and I'd like to hear your\nresponse.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I don't think\nthere's any reason to assume that everyone becomes a\ncriminal. What this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, only people who come over\nhere because they don't want to pay taxes in those\ncountries. Sometimes we would agree with them --\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, in order to\nviolate the wire fraud statute, you have to use deception\nin order to deprive another --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they don't tell Lenin that\nthey're coming --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that wouldn't involve the\nuse of the United States wires --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and they write to each\nother. They have a cousin, in Brooklyn, who forwards them\nthe money to get out.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, if one stipulates\nthat that violates the wire fraud statute or that there's\nenough conduct that does, the question still comes down to\nwhether the United States chooses to prosecute that case.\nThis is not a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question comes down to\nwhether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that\nway, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to\nread it that way. What about -- does Canada have an\nincome tax?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure of Canadian tax law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume --\nMR. DREEBEN: In the context of this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- Canada has an income tax.\nWould you -- would you prosecute a Canadian who files a\ndeceptive Canadian income tax return?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not for using Canadian facilities\nto do so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, from this country.\nHe's -- you know, he's a snow goose and is in Florida when\nhe files his return.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He files it electronically.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMR. DREEBEN: The wire fraud statute is\napplicable to schemes to defraud, generally speaking. The\nquestions in this case are whether there is a common law\nrule that should be read to provide background.\nJUSTICE BREYER: One reason for it -- I just --\nyou don't seem to know completely about Canadian law. How\nmuch do you know about the tax law of Vietnam? Because\nLos Angeles is filled with Vietnamese refugees, many\ncommunities of such people in the United States. Do we\nknow how many of them perhaps might owe taxes under the\nlaw of Vietnam, and maybe are talking to each other about\nwhether they really want to pay it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think this is a realistic\nproblem, Justice Breyer, that should require the Court not\nto read a statute whose language --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the wealth tax\nin France?\nMR. DREEBEN: There are a variety of taxing\nschemes all across the world. The question that the\nUnited States has to make when it determines whether to\nprosecute a wire fraud scheme is whether it's in interest\n-- in the interest --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, at the beginning\nof your argument, you said there were four federal\ninterests you were going to identify. You've been able to\nidentify one. You don't want them running around with guns.\nWhat are the other three?\nMR. DREEBEN: The other three are --\nMR. DREEBEN: The second one, which I began to\nallude to before hearing some questions about -- foreign\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before you were asked a brief\nquestion.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- are that people who engage in\nschemes in this country are capable of then using the same\ntechniques against victims in this country. The third\nreason is that the creation of international schemes to\ndefraud, like the smuggling scheme in this case, poses\nindependent threats to the United States Government\nbecause international criminal organizations are\nparticularly difficult for the United States to deal with.\nAnd the fourth reason is that it is an offense to a\nforeign government, the United States Executive Branch may\nconclude, to allow our soil and our wires to be used to\nperpetrate a smuggling scheme against a foreign government\nwith the United States doing nothing about it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if we're concerned\nabout offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to\ngo, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we\nnegotiate treaties? I mean, one of the reasons why we go\nthe treaty route are the kind of problems that Justice\nBreyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties.\nWe want two things. We want to make sure that it's a\nbasically fair system that we're dealing with. On the\nother hand, we want to say, \"If we do anything with\nrespect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get\nthe same benefit from you with respect to ours.\"\nSo never mind the revenue rule, isn't it\npervasive that -- when it comes to enforcing tax claims,\nthat the route that Congress has chosen to go, and the\nExecutive, as well, has been the treaty route?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, those are tax\ntreaties designed to mutually assist the countries to\ncollect taxes. This is a prosecution directed at fraud.\nThe collection of taxes in a cooperative, reciprocal\nmanner between governments implicates very different\ninterests than the United States has when it seeks to\ncombat people who have intended to devise, or have\ndevised, a scheme to defraud in the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- United States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- one of -- one of the last\ninterests that you mentioned, about offending foreign\ngovernments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the\none that -- the country that's been done out of taxes is\nCanada, not the United States. So, we should help Canada,\nif it's interested in collecting revenue from these people\nor trying them for a criminal offense, to do that. It --\nI asked Ms. Brill, Have they been indicted in Canada? She\nsaid yes, but she said it's -- they had not -- there has\nnot been a request for extradition. Is that -- is that --\nMR. DREEBEN: That's my understanding, as well,\nJustice Ginsburg. And the pursuit of this prosecution by\nthe United States reflects that when United States\ncitizens engage in fraudulent conduct on our soil, our\nGovernment has a distinct interest, from Canada's\ninterest, in pursuing the prosecution of this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How long has this statute been\non the books, this wire fraud statute? Pretty old\nstatute.\nMR. DREEBEN: 1952. And its antecedents are the\nmail fraud statute, which was enacted in 1872.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many prosecutions like this\nhave there been? When was the first one?\nMR. DREEBEN: This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For, you know, using the mails\nor interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of\ntaxes?\nMR. DREEBEN: This type of prosecution became\nmore common in the 1980s when Canada greatly increased its\ntaxes on importation of tobacco and alcohol.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More common, or didn't exist at\nall before the 19- -- do you know of any case before --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I'm not aware of any case\nbefore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- before the 1980s?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't that suggest to you\nthat the statute isn't naturally read to cover stuff like\nthat?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I think the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't have smugglers before\nthen?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, of course there were smugglers\nbefore then, but the statute, on its face, is broad. And\nthe only justification -- the only two justifications for\nseeking to read it narrowly are, first, that there's a\ncommon law revenue rule that forms a backdrop for the\nconstruction of the statute. That is wrong, the\nGovernment submits, because there is no common law revenue\nrule that has ever been articulated that says one country\ncannot prosecute people in that country for defrauding a\nforeign government of tax --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the second reason?\nMR. DREEBEN: The second reason is the claim\nthat to deprive a foreign government of money by not\npaying tax revenues is not common law fraud.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Well, and you have\narguments against both of those two. Which arguments\nare at least -- at least -- arguable? What about a\nthird rule, the rule of lenity?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If we -- if we are unsure, if\nit's a close question whether it's property, if it's a\nclose question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of\nCanada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws\nof Canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the\nrule of lenity apply?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, if the Court concluded that\nthe question was not susceptible of resolution by resort\nto the usual tools of statutory construction, then you\nwould apply the rule of lenity. But it's our submission\nthat neither of these two theories --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask this question?\nI think you have conceded, in a footnote -- and maybe\nyou're -- almost conceded -- that if this were a RICO\ncase, a civil RICO case, that the Congress enacted the\nRICO statute against this background rule and that perhaps\nthe RICO case could not go forward. What if it were a\nfederal RICO case and -- the same facts -- would the RICO\nstatute be qualified by the revenue rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it would not, Justice Stevens,\nand that's because of the precise distinction that I drew\nin response to Justice Scalia's question. This is a suit\nby the United States Government, as Plaintiff, not by a\nforeign government, as Plaintiff or prosecutor. The\nrevenue rule essentially concerned with interests of\nsovereignty. One foreign government should not be able to\ncome into our courts and enforce its sovereign power by\nusing our courts to collect taxes from our citizens.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the other reasons\nunderlying it, which is what I was trying to get at\nbefore? I see, literally, that the common law -- you\nknow, the enforcement rule, this is not literally\nenforcement. But what I was driving at with my questions\nis, even though literally it's not, the problems of\ncomplexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems\nof there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we\nmight think are basically unfair, that those\nconsiderations apply here, just as they do with the\nenforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning\npeople into criminals under threat of prosecution by the\nFederal Government is really very much equivalent to\nenforcing the foreign rule in a court. I mean, that's the\nwhole thing spelled out. And I meant it seriously, though\nI used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home.\nWhat is your response to that?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, first of\nall, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that\nwould defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to\nshow specific intent to defraud if the law were not\nsufficiently clear for us to be able to meet that burden.\nThis case illustrates the kind of prosecution that will be\nbrought. There are taxes that are due upon the\nimportation of alcohol. The Petitioners arranged, through\nthe wires, to bring alcohol from Maryland up to New York,\nand then they got it across the border by not answering\nquestions when asked by customs officials and by not going\nto secondary inspection when they were asked. In order to\nbring a criminal prosecution that requires specific intent\nto defraud, the government is not going to be relying on\nobscure systems.\nAs to the concern about the enforcement of tax\nsystems that the United States may believe are -- is\nunfair, that is the prerogative of the Executive Branch to\ndetermine in deciding whether a prosecution should be\nbrought in a particular case. This Court has repeatedly\nrecognized that the Executive Branch is the preeminent\nbranch in the area of foreign affairs --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To go to one more aspect of\nthe statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress\nsaid that -- with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud\nand, I think, other things -- that restitution to the\nvictim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the\ngovernment to decide restitution or not. Except here\nrestitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's\ntaxes, so you have conceded no restitution. But it seems\nto me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud\nstatutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and\nthat suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to\nbe the object of the scheme to defraud.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism\ndoesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue\nrule, as defined in the common law cases that can be\npointed to as the background principle, has to do with a\nforeign government, or someone acting on its behalf,\ncoming into this country's courts to enforce its tax\nrules. Here what you have is the United States Government\ndetermining that it is in the interest of the United\nStates to bring a criminal prosecution.\nNow, in this case, the prosecutor did concede\nbelow that restitution was not appropriately ordered.\nThat's not the position of the United States. The\nposition of the United States is that restitution under\nthe mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not\ninfringe the revenue rule. But there are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, how could that be,\nbecause restitution is to the victim? The victim is\nCanada. You collect Congress -- or Canada's tax, and you\ngive it to Canada. Is there any other kind of\nrestitution?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg,\nbut the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it\napplies to efforts by the United States Government to\nsecure punishment by -- for a criminal conviction.\nBut, Justice Ginsburg, if the Court were to\ndisagree with that and were to believe that restitution,\neven when it's been sought by the United States -- not by\na foreign government, in its own right, with the power to\ninstigate a lawsuit -- but that even when the United\nStates does it, that somehow falls within the parameters\nof the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that\nproblem would be to interpret the restitution statute\nagainst the background of the revenue rule, not to\ninterpret the wire fraud statute against the background of\nthe revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the United\nStates is wholly barred.\nThe Petitioner's submission here is really\nrather extraordinary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The restitution statute is not\nambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of\nambiguities in it. And if I had to find my way out of the\nrestitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to\nget out, rather than simply saying, \"Well, though this\nrestitution statute says this categorically, we will\nignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be\nenforcing the revenue laws of another country.\" There's\nnothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another\ncountry, if we want to; this is just a question of\nstatutory interpretation. Should this ambiguous statute\nbe interpreted that way? If Congress said, \"We're going\nto enforce Canada's tax laws,\" there's nothing wrong with\nthat. But --\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have two statutes. One\nof them seems to be quite ambiguous. The other one is\ncategorical, you get restitution in all cases. Now, how\ndo I wiggle out of it?\nMR. DREEBEN: There's a difference --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Obviously, I wiggle out of\nit with the ambiguous statute.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- there's a difference, Justice\nScalia, between an ambiguous statute and a broad statute.\nThe wire fraud statute is unequivocally broad, and it has\nbeen so interpreted. It's not ambiguous on the question\nof whether it applies to schemes to defraud that may\ninvolve foreign victims; it says \"any scheme to defraud.\"\nAnd I think, as Justice Kennedy's questions pointed out\nearlier, if there were a scheme to defraud a foreign\nbusiness interest in Canada or a foreign governmental\ninterest in Canada relating to some commercial venture,\nthe wire fraud statute would apply, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about a\nscheme --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't told me -- you\nhaven't told me how you get out of the restitution\nstatute. There's no ambiguity there, and it is not a rule\nof law that you can't -- it's unconstitutional to enforce\nthe tax laws of Canada. Since it's entirely feasible, and\nsince the text is categorical, how do you get out of the\nrestitution statute?\nMR. DREEBEN: Here is how I get out of it,\nJustice Scalia. If you think, as I do not, that the\nrevenue rule would bar restitution at the behest of the\nUnited States in a criminal prosecution, there is a\nbackground principle that says when there is an\nestablished rule of the common law, Congress legislates\nagainst that background, and unless it makes its intent\nclear and unequivocal to overcome that background rule of\nthe common law, then the statute will not be interpreted\nto be in derogation of it. It was that principle that\nformed the basis for the government's view that Canada\ncannot come in under the RICO statute --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that view is in --\nsomewhat in tension with your view that the common law\nrevenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution.\nIf you have to interpret the statute in light of the\ngeneral rule that one country doesn't mess with another\ncountry's taxes, absent a treaty.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is\nno common law rule that one country doesn't mess with\nanother country's taxes. What there are, are a set of\ncases that deal with specific problems in which foreign\ntaxes were at issue. And in all of the 20th century\nversions of this problem, what you had is a foreign\ngovernment or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign\ngovernment, coming into another country seeking to use\nthat country's courts to enforce its own tax rules. And\nin that context, the justifications for saying that one\ncountry will not enforce another country's revenue laws\nhave to do with the sovereignty interests of the host\ncountry.\nOne country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to\ncarry out its own governmental policies, is doing\nsomething fundamental to its sovereign existence, and\nthere's no obligation of the United States to assist the\nforeign government in using its court system to achieve\nthose independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it,\neither. As Justice Scalia pointed out, it's not\nunconstitutional, if Congress wanted to allow it. But\ncountries, historically, have not. And that principle\ndoes form an important backdrop --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have countries also -- just --\nhere, I don't know, in respect to the principle -- would\nit have been viewed as contrary to the principle if a\ncountry were to pass a law -- say, England were to pass a\nlaw saying it is a crime in England not to pay French\ntaxes? I'm not saying they couldn't do it; I'm just\nsaying, would a law like that, saying it is a crime in\nEngland not to pay French taxes -- would it have been\nviewed as contrary to an abrogation of -- or a -- you\nknow, whatever you call it -- a derogation from the common\nlaw revenue rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that that's essentially\nthe same question in this case, with the one significant\ndifference that here there is a domestic --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But do you see why I want to\ncharacterize it? I mean, would you characterize -- my\ncriminal statute's absolutely clear -- the clear is, it is\na crime in England not to pay French taxes. Now, would\nyou, or would scholars, or whoever, knew about the common\nlaw revenue rule, would they have said, \"There is a\nderogation from the common law revenue rule,\" or would\nthey have said, \"It has nothing to do with it\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't know what scholars\nwould have said about it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, what would you have said?\nMR. DREEBEN: This is what I would say\nabout it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. DREEBEN: When you're dealing with the\nprinciple that a statute of the United States will not be\nconstrued to be in derogation of a common law unless it's\nclear that that's its purpose, the Court should be very\ncareful in defining what the parameters of the common law\nare. The Court should not take a common law rule and\ntreat it as some dynamic entity that has capability of\ngrowing a dimension that is not consistent with its\npurposes and that it had never assumed in any decided case\nas a means of telling Congress, \"You can't do what you\nhave done.\"\nSo I would say, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We haven't told -- no, no, no,\nno, no, no, we're not telling Congress, \"You can't do what\nyou have done.\" We're saying, \"Congress hasn't done\nthis.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the only reason you would\nsay that Congress hasn't done it, Justice Scalia, is if\nyou concluded that -- and I would ask Petitioners what\ntheir best citations are, because I have not been able to\nfind them -- what cases indicate that a country cannot\nbring the kind of prosecution that the United States did\nhere to vindicate its own independent sovereign --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Nobody says they can't do it.\nThat's why I asked you my question. My question is simply\nwhether you would consider an absolutely clear law -- we\nwill -- we -- it is a crime not to pay your French taxes.\nI'm asking whether you would consider that -- I'm not\nsaying they can't do it; I just want to know -- would it\nbe in derogation of the common law principle?\nMR. DREEBEN: It would probably be in derogation\nof a more --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- fundamental principle.\nMR. DREEBEN: Not the revenue rule --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not the --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- but a more fundamental\nprinciple that one country usually does not legislate with\nrespect to extraterritorial acts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would be another one, too.\nMR. DREEBEN: But if you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they -- I -- that's why\nI want to know --\nMR. DREEBEN: But that's not applicable here,\neither, Justice Breyer, because the crime involves wire\nfraud in the United States.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but why isn't it applicable\nto the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation\nto order restitution? And it seems to me that the\nrestitution that would be ordered would be just as much in\nderogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out\ncollection in Justice Breyer's example.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, again, to say that\nit's in derogation of the common law principle assumes\nthat the common law principle has applicability to one\ncountry seeking to vindicate interests of its --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I -- a moment ago,\nyou said, \"Okay, we'll assume that there would be some\nderogation,\" in Justice Breyer's example. I don't see why\nyou don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the\nrestitution aspect here.\nMR. DREEBEN: Because the derogation that I was\ntalking about with respect to Justice Breyer is punishing\nconduct that occurs entirely extraterritorially. This is\nnot conduct that occurs entirely --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but the revenue -- the\nrevenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-\nextraterritorial enforcement. It has -- it has other\nrationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue\nrule is; the -- you know, the problems of policy; there\nare lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we\ncertainly wouldn't want to enforce, and so on. It's not\njust extraterritoriality. And those -- those policies\nwould be just as much implicated by the -- by the\nrestitution as by the out-and-out enforcement in Justice\nBreyer's example.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter, I think that\nthe policies underlying the revenue rule are narrower than\nthe ones that you have articulated; but, even more to the\npoint, they are not justifications that found their way\ninto any holdings that would lead a reasonable legislator\nin 1952, when the wire fraud statute was enacted, to\nconclude that this is a rule that I'm going to have to\nspecifically --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, perhaps --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, go on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, perhaps\nthere were no specific holdings, because it would have\nbeen regarded as, kind of, a bizarre derogation of the\nrule in the first place. Nobody had dreamed up this\nscheme earlier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was about to say the same --\nthe same thing. You keep saying there are no cases that\ndo this. Are there -- are there -- are there cases,\nbefore 1980, which do what you want to do -- that is, to\nuse our fraud law, or something, to effectively enforce\nCanada's -- or some foreign country's tax law?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but what I would say about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- the revenue rule is that it is\na shrinking principle of the common law, not one that has\nbeen growing. It originally started out as a principle\nthat allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts\nthat they believed were in furtherance of commerce. It\ngradually came under attack, because what it said is that\nthe United States will not notice that a foreign country's\nlaws have been violated in the formation of a contract,\nand so the contract will be enforced. Commentators\nrecognized that that was contrary to principles of comity\nand recognition that each country does have a reciprocal\ninterest in acknowledging each other's laws.\nIn the 20th century, those contract cases\ncompletely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left\nare sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert\nits sovereign power inside the United States or inside a\nforeign country -- the United States, itself, tried it\nonce in Canada -- to collect taxes. And countries said,\n\"We're not going to do that. We're going to leave it to\nthe treaty process.\"\nBut the rationales that Justice Breyer and\nJustice Souter have articulated, about complexity of\nforeign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never\nbeen the driving force behind the revenue rule. It's been\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I got your point. I think it\nis that -- in my answer to my clear example, you would\nsay no, that's not in derogation for the reason that\nthere's an independent local reason for doing it. It's\nnot being done to -- whether it has that effect or not,\nit's not being done in order to collect the foreign tax.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's been your response\nthroughout.\nMR. DREEBEN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I --\nMR. DREEBEN: What you have instead is a law of\nthe United States that's enacted to serve perfectly valid\ninterests that the United States Government has in rooting\nout fraud in this country and in dealing with schemes to\ndefraud that are created here. And for the Court to say\nthat, \"We don't like these kinds of prosecutions, because\nwe're concerned about really bad foreign tax systems, and\nwe're concerned about complicated law, and we're concerned\nthat some common law rule that had never actually assumed\nthe scope that Petitioners ascribed to it, should be\nformed -- read as the background principle for the\ninterpretation of this statute\" is not a principle that\nfinds any support in the construction of federal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you --\nthis is such a curious case. You were very candid in\ntelling us that when Canada put these astronomical taxes\non tobacco and alcohol, that was almost an invitation to\nsmugglers. Did we have any discussions with Canada -- I\nmean, they do have that border, which is rather easy to\ncross -- about what we were going to do when they put the\ntaxes on liquor sky-high?\nMR. DREEBEN: I am not aware, Justice Ginsburg,\nof what specific law enforcement conversations occurred,\nbut I can tell you that there is extensive law enforcement\ncooperation with Canada, as a close neighbor, and that the\ninterests of the United States very much do favor our\npolicing against smuggling here, and Canada policing\nagainst smuggling there.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\nMs. Brill, you have four-and-a-half minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURA W. BRILL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMS. BRILL: Thank you.\nThe common law cases universally say that it\ndoes not matter who is bringing the claim. It can be the\nforeign government or it can be another person.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just ask you to tell us\nwhat your strongest case is? Because they did raise that\nquestion.\nMS. BRILL: Sure. On the -- on the issue of the\nidentity of the person bringing the claim, the contract\ncases, Holman and Boucher, stand for that proposition, and\nthe Peter Buchanan case, which came down in 1950, just\nbefore the wire fraud statute was enacted -- this was in\nthe Appellate Court in Ireland -- it says, \"It is not a\nquestion whether the plaintiff is a foreign state or the\nrepresentative of a foreign state or its revenue\nauthority. In every case, the substance of a claim must\nbe scrutinized. And if it then appears that it is really\na suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of\na foreign revenue, it must be rejected.\" That's at 1955\nA.C. 529.\nAnd so with the -- with the Mandatory\nRestitution Act, this clearly is something to collect the\ndebts of a foreign nation. And the sentencing scheme that\nJustice Ginsburg alluded to earlier, in which the\nsentences were enhanced based on the intended loss,\ndemonstrate that this is an enforcement action.\nStringam versus Dubois, which is an Alberta\ncase from 1992, involving -- the plaintiff there was an\nexecutor of a probate estate, and the court said, \"The\nidentity of the plaintiff in the action is not vital if\nthe action indirectly has the effect of enforcing revenue\nlaws of a foreign country.\" That's at 135 A.C. at page\n70.\nAnd the way the revenue rule has been cited\nrepeatedly is that it -- what it prevents is not just\ndirect enforcement, but direct or indirect enforcement.\nAnd so it is -- the fact that there have not been criminal\nprosecutions, it clearly would have been in derogation of\nthe common law for a -- for England to pass a statute\nsaying it is criminal in England to break the laws of\nFrance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: See, he's saying it isn't, for\nthe reason that, he says, that if England did it for\nindependent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted\nto help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have\nbeen in derogation. Of course, it would have been legal,\neither way, but he says it wouldn't have been in\nderogation, for that reason.\nMS. BRILL: Right. Well, it clearly would have.\nThere was no common law practice -- we have -- we have not\nfound, in all the research -- and the Government has not\nfound -- any example of a criminal prosecution -- not just\nin this country; anywhere in the world -- to -- deriving\nfrom the violation of a foreign government's tax. And so\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying, in effect, that\nderogation is an effects test, not an intent test.\nMS. BRILL: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Justice\nSouter.\nAnd the -- in terms of what the government's\ninterests are, there were no deceptive acts in this\ncountry. The way the Government gets a material\nmisstatement is by a failure to disclose at the Canadian\nborder, which only -- even though they did not put in\nevidence of what the -- that Canada even had a law\nrequiring disclosure, the only way there could have been\nany kind of material misstatement would be if Canadian law\nrequired it, not if -- not anything that happened in the\nUnited States.\nIn Cleveland, the Court was very clear to point\nout -- one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in\ninterpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud\nstatute is because violations serve as a predicate for\nRICO actions and for money-laundering violations. And so\nwhat the government's position is, is that we should carve\nout this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud\nprosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a\ncivil RICO action and even though we're going to have an\nad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution\nAct. But what the Court said in Cleveland is, the way we\nshould do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in\nthe first place, not by -- of the wire fraud statute --\nnot by having ad-hoc exceptions.\nAnd the reference to prosecutorial discretion\nthat there should be faith that the Government will only\nprosecute, I guess, what the Government regards as\nexceptional cases is not something that can provide any\nbusiness involved in an international transaction with any\n-- with any comfort.\nAnd thank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
