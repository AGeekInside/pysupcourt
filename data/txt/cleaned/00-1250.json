DELLINGER, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTitle I of the Americans With Disabilities Act\ndoes more than merely prohibit hostile discrimination\nagainst individuals with disabilities. Congress\nrecognized that an additional kind of discrimination is\nthe failure of employers through indifference or whatever\nto undertake reasonable accommodations to the physical or\nmental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals. As\na result, this act does affirmatively require businesses\nto lift barriers that inhibit employment opportunities for\nthose with disabilities.\nThe question here, though, is whether, in one\nparticular respect, the act goes beyond a requirement that\nobstacles be cleared away. The issue is this. Where an\nemployee is unable, because of a disability, to continue\nin his job, is that employee entitled to be placed in\nanother position instead of a more senior fellow employee\nwho would be entitled to the job under the normal\noperation of a bona fide seniority system?\nNow, this is not an easy question, but we\nbelieve that in the end a clear answer necessarily emerges\nfrom the act, and that is this, that the act simply does\nnot require an employer to override neutral selection\ncriteria wholly unrelated to disability in choosing among\napplicants for a position, and in particular it does not\nrequire the employer to set aside the normal operation of\na bona fide seniority system.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting by\nthat argument that the express exception for bona fide\nseniority systems in title VII was surplusage, that it\nwasn't needed, because there would have been -- it would\nhave been counted as a neutral rule?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. In fact, I\nthink the presence of that provision in title VII is part\nof a background assumption in which neither title VII nor\nany other Civil Rights Act has ever taken what would be a\nfairly substantial step of requiring an employer to prefer\nsomeone for a position over an employee who is entitled to\nit under a seniority system or, indeed, to prefer any\napplicant over a more qualified employee.\nQUESTION: But your answer is that it wasn't\nnecessary to put that in title VII, title VII would apply\njust the same way without it?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. I do not\nbelieve that --\nQUESTION: Is there any indication that that's\nwhat Congress thought when it didn't -- I mean, it does\nseem a rather conspicuous absence, that the model statute,\nthe basic one has an express exception for bona fide\nseniority systems, and this one doesn't.\nMR. DELLINGER: Title VII took especial care to\ndo that, but if you look at the more relevant statute, the\nRehabilitation Act, it also does not contain any express\nexception and, moreover, it was interpreted not to require\nthat, but most importantly under title VII, is this\nCourt's decision in TWA v. Hardison, where the Court said\nit would reach the same result as the principle we argue\nfor here, even without, even before you get to the portion\nof the act about bona fide seniority systems.\nThe Court in Hardison held that the reasonable\naccommodation language of that act for religious\nadherence, the same reasonable accommodation undue\nhardship language does not require displacing the rights\nof more senior employees under a seniority system in order\nto accommodate a religious adherence need to avoid working\non a Saturday shift.\nQUESTION: But are there any instances in which\nthe seniority clause has to be ignored in favor of a\nreasonable accommodation? Suppose there are two positions\nand they pay the same thing, but a senior employee wants\nposition A, and that's the only one that the disabled\nperson can fulfill? The seniority provision trumps there?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, it does, Justice Kennedy,\nand let me acknowledge that, of course, whenever you have\na clear rule like the rule here that an employee, that an\nemployer may apply a neutral standard unrelated to\ndisability, such as a merit standard or a seniority\nstandard, any time you have a clear rule, and that's the\nway seniority systems operate, you're going to have\nindividual cases where, if you had a different kind of\nsystem involving individual assessment, you might reach a\ndifferent conclusion in the very particular instances, but\nthat -- that notion that you look and see whether in one\nparticular case favoring the interest of the less-senior\nemployee would in some social sense be better, that system\nis fundamentally incompatible with the nature of how a\nseniority system operates.\nThis is a system that, for US Airways, there are\n14,000 customer service employees. Seniority is a system\nthat gets rid of the potential of favoritism --\nQUESTION: Would you talk about what the system\nis here, because I found it a little hard to understand.\nIs it that a policy of the employer, the airline, that\nevery so often all positions in the category in which this\nperson worked are declared vacant?\nMR. DELLINGER: I think that terminology is not\nused, Justice O'Connor. The effect may be the same. What\nhappens under US Airways' system is that periodically,\nbasically once a quarter, all positions are put up for\nrebidding.\nQUESTION: All positions throughout the company,\nor in certain categories of jobs?\nMR. DELLINGER: All through the entire category\nof customer service employees, which would be 14,000. I\ndon't think they rebuild the --\nQUESTION: Customer service jobs, once a\nquarter, are all declared open?\nMR. DELLINGER: That's right. Each different\ndivision would -- well, they're not so much declared open,\nas simply put up for rebidding. That is, the way the\nsystem operates is that there is a -- it's a very simple\nsystem. There's a list kept in order of seniority.\nEverybody can rely upon where they are in the pecking\norder of that list. When there are positions eliminated,\nthe people who are in those positions are not necessarily\nthe ones who lose their job.\nIf two positions are eliminated in the freight\narea, the two juniormost employees have to leave, and\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, we're not talking about job\nelimination. I thought we were talking about an existing\njob that continues but it's declared open.\nMR. DELLINGER: No. There is no -- there's\nno -- if you gained the impression from respondent's brief\nthat Mr. Barnett's position was somehow singled out to be\ndeclared vacant --\nQUESTION: No. No, all customer service jobs,\nevery quarter, are essentially declared open. Is that the\npolicy?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. That is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: And at that -- is it also true, as I\nthink you allege, that the seniority policy does not\ncreate legally enforceable rights in any employee? No\nemployee wanting to come in would be able to sue to get\nthat enforced.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. The\ncompany's --\nQUESTION: So what kind of a seniority plan is\nthat? I mean, on the one hand you say, we have to apply\nour seniority plan, but on the other hand, it isn't\nenforceable.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, and I'm glad you asked\nthat. Of course, the company's consistent position in\ncourt, whenever someone wants to have a court review how a\nseniority plan is applied, is it relies upon the fact that\nit does not create legal rights enforceable in court, but\nno one has challenged the fact that it is a bona fide\nprogram. It's not a --\nQUESTION: I know, but what would be the\nsituation if there were truly a vacant position at US\nAirways in customer service? Would you think the ADA\nwould say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to\nconsider a disabled employee for placement in one of those\nslots?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, absolutely. We believe\nthat the reassignment aspect of reasonable accommodation\ndoes have considerable bite and does considerable work.\nIt requires you not only to consider, but actively\nconsider whether there are any other vacant places in\nwhich you could place an employee.\nQUESTION: I mean, there is a provision in the\nact itself, is there not, that speaks to a vacancy and\nthat can be a reasonable accommodation?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct, and we believe\nthat what that means, Justice O'Connor, is that an\nemployer must, unlike the situation under the\nRehabilitation Act, where you could simply say you can't\ndo the job --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- we're letting you go, we\ncan't accommodate that job, they have no obligation to\nconsider other places in the company.\nHere, they have to actively consider. You have\nto actually go out, you're obligated to go out and try to\nfind a vacant position.\nQUESTION: Okay, so why isn't the sort of thing\nthat US Airways does here, declaring all these jobs open\nonce a quarter, create the kind of thing that US Airways\nhas to consider a vacant position?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, you are exactly right that\nwhen the quarterly rebidding process comes up, yes, they\nhave to consider, and they did, indeed, consider Mr.\nBarnett's request to be transferred into that position.\nMoreover, if they needed to make adjustment or\naccommodations on how that second position functioned,\nthey would be obligated to do that as well.\nWhat they were not obligated to do at this\npoint, after they've identified available positions,\noverridden any arbitrary rules that say, you know, some\npeople can't have that position, altered the position,\nthey then consider whether there's any good reason not to\nplace Mr. Barnett in that position and, in the absence of\na good reason, they are required by this provision to do\nso. At this point, we believe that the better reading of\nthe act does not require the employer to override neutral\nselection criteria wholly unrelated to disability in\nchoosing among applicants --\nQUESTION: May I ask, do you mean any neutral --\nany neutral selection criteria would trump the statute?\nSay they had a criteria that they used brand new employees\nfor certain ticket-selling jobs as a training mechanism,\nand they always took people who hadn't worked for the\ncompany for more than 90 days or something, that that was\ntheir regular practice, would that practice always trump\nthe interest of the disability -- disabled person?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. I believe that an employer\nis entitled, under the statute -- you've got to have a\ngood, neutral reason unrelated to disability, but the\nbright line --\nQUESTION: Now you've added the word good. I\nthought it only had to be neutral.\nMR. DELLINGER: I mean good in the sense that it\nhas to be legitimate, bona fide business reason.\nQUESTION: Something they always do.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. You've got to, because the\nact requires you to make this appointment, but where\nwe --\nQUESTION: Suppose you have a seniority system\nthat's riddled with exceptions.\nMR. DELLINGER: Where you have a seniority\nsystem that's riddled with exceptions, it is perfectly\nopen to someone who challenges that to say, you don't\nreally have a neutral policy unrelated to disability.\nQUESTION: No, no, you do. I mean, here you\nhappen to have just one exception. Well, suppose there\nwere five or six, and so the argument would be, well, if\nyou can make an exception for the hardship, the\ncatastrophic illness, for this special situation in that\none, what we want you to do is also make an exception for\nthe handicapped person.\nNow, nobody's doubting the employer's good\nfaith. The question is, well, why not make na exception\nfor us. You have a lot of others. Let's have a trial on\nit to see how open to you that is.\nMR. DELLINGER: The answer to your question is,\nno, you are not required to do the reassignment merely\nbecause your seniority policy is one that applies\nseniority in some circumstances and not others.\nQUESTION: All right, then at that point I'd\nbecome uncertain what exactly -- why we should hold what\nyou want, from my point of view. That is, I can easily\nsee this act simply requires the employer to act\nreasonably, and now you could say, where there's a\nlongstanding seniority system, and there's nothing special\nabout it, and there are zero or very few exceptions, it's\nautomatically a reasonable thing to not stir up enormous\ntrouble in the workplace by saying, we're going to start\nmaking exceptions. I could see that. I'm not saying I\nagree, but I understand it.\nBut now, why is it, if there are, however, quite\na few exceptions, that it isn't even open to the\nhandicapped person to argue, make another, it's not\nunreasonable to make another?\nMR. DELLINGER: Let me preface my answer by\nsaying that for decades US Airways has had an established\nseniority policy that covers all of these positions, which\nhas been regularly followed, with one exception for\ncatastrophic illnesses and one revision of how you\ncalculate the time of seniority, so that that issue is\nnot, you know, raised or put before the Court as to\nwhether you would think that not a good reason.\nBut it seems to me that under -- if you look at\nthe sequence from the title VII through the Rehabilitation\nAct, through Hardison, the background principle that our\ncivil rights laws have simply not restricted the ability\nof an employer to make a good faith determination about\nhow to fill positions, and that nothing in the ADA itself\nseems to question that bedrock assumption. That is to\nsay, no one suggests, though it would be a perfectly --\nnot unduly costly that you need to add positions.\nEveryone seems to concede and agree that you don't need to\ntransfer an employee to a position that would constitute\na, quote, promotion, unquote, even though that might --\nthe employee might be qualified to do that position. No\none suggests that you have to bump an employee who was\nactually sitting in a position.\nHere, what you have is the defeated expectations\nunder a seniority system, and if that system is bona fide,\nthe way it works is to allow each employee to determine\nwhat his or her most important desires are, and that is\nwhat you gain through seniority. If you lose to --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dellinger --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- one of the reasons that I find\nthis particular statute puzzling is that it's not like\ntitle VII. Title VII says, thou shalt not discriminate.\nIt says, you don't prefer -- you don't just redress\nimbalances. It's a straight nondiscrimination statute.\nThis one isn't. This one is driven by a concept\ncalled, reasonable accommodation. It makes reasonable\naccommodation -- if you don't reasonably accommodate,\nyou're discriminating, and so it seems to me that this\nstatute has reasonable accommodation, if it's undue\nhardship, then it would be unreasonable, but there's\nnothing like that in title VII. This disabilities act\ngives a starring role to reasonable accommodation, which\nit truly doesn't have in title VII, so to give that\neffect, couldn't you look at this and say, well, this man\nwas already in the job, and no body is going to be out of\nwork, so the accommodation is reasonable. If he were\nseeking to bump somebody else, it wouldn't be reasonable.\nWhy isn't that an appropriate way to look at this act\nthat's driven by the idea, reasonable accommodation?\nMR. DELLINGER: Let me acknowledge that what\nmakes this an interesting case is the fact that the ADA\ndoes go beyond merely prohibiting hostile discrimination,\nso you're right that there are things that an employer\naffirmatively has to do that it doesn't have to do for\nother employees under this act.\nThe general language of the act, though, in my\nview is not sufficient to change the landscape that\nexisted under the Rehabilitation Act, where the Courts had\nuniformly held that reassignment was never required. It's\nnow a possibility, but you're never required.\nQUESTION: But did the statute have the word,\nreassignment in it, as this one does?\nMR. DELLINGER: It did not have in it the word,\nreassignment, but we don't think that that word is\nintended to change -- in the Hardison case under title VII\nit was a reasonable accommodation case, and yet the Court\nsaid, no, there's a bright line. We're never -- even\nthough the religious part of title VII requires a\nreasonable accommodation, we're never going to require\nanother employee to sacrifice his or her standing under\nthe seniority policy.\nNow, the other part of your question, I think\nthe question asked by Justice Breyer was, but what if it's\nreally reasonable in a particular instance, and here's\nwhere I need to suggest why that approach is fundamentally\ninconsistent with how a seniority system operates. You\nare introducing an element of judgment and discretion\nwhich will unsettle settled expectations in a way that is\ncompletely unpredictable. What happens is, you simply\ncan't know what the domino effect will be of substituting\nfor a seniority system.\nThis is a system that is now operated by lower\nlevel managers who need to keep a posted list where every\nemployee knows what the position is. If someone -- it\nwould be a fundamental alteration of the system to require\nthe employer no longer to utilize this neutral basis. For\nexample --\nQUESTION: I notice that one of the amicus\nbriefs suggests -- on behalf of labor unions suggests that\nthat might well be true if it were the subject of\ncollective bargaining and an agreement, but not for an\nordinary employer plan. Is that how you read the brief?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is how you read that brief,\nand I see that is not a distinction which Congress made in\ntitle VII when it chose there to protect seniority\nplans,and it is not one that seems to make a great deal of\nsense here. That is, in many States, in spite of the\nlanguage put in by US Airways, in many States the\nprovisions of a company plan are legally enforceable in\ncourt.\nMoreover, I don't think there's any intent on\nCongress to weigh in on the question of whether the\nworkforce should be unionized or not unionized by giving\nthe disabled lesser rights --\nQUESTION: Then if that's true, then what\nmeaning do we give to reasonable accommodation in the ADA?\nMR. DELLINGER: I think what reasonable\naccommodation --\nQUESTION: It has to be something different, I\nassume, than undue hardship, because that's a separate\ndefense.\nMR. DELLINGER: Undue hardship, that's right,\nreally goes to cost on an employer. I think the\nreasonable accommodation language here requires an\nemployer to take affirmative steps to try to enable a\nperson with a disability to continue in the workplace, and\nin particular with respect to reassignments, to look for\nvacant places to make second job accommodatable, for\nexample, but not to cross a very major line --\nQUESTION: But in a situation where the\nemployer's policy is just to create open positions every\nquarter, that aren't enforceable anyway on behalf of any\nemployee, is it unreasonable to say the employer has to\naccommodate this disabled worker?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, it is unreasonable for the\nfollowing reason. The reassignment, the sort of quarterly\ndeclaration of vacancy to which you refer is simply how a\nsystem operates where every employee accumulates seniority\nand then gets to choose the position and the shift, so\nthat if you gain seniority, you get enough, you say thank\ngoodness I can now get off the graveyard shift, I can go\non the swing shift or the day shift position, I've gained\nall of this, and that is rebid every quarter. People\nrebid on positions, and that seems like a perfectly\nreasonable thing to do.\nIt is a -- there's nothing -- what is the bright\nline, I think, here is that Congress has -- would have\nfought long and debated hard before it took the major step\nof saying an employer could not, at the end of the day,\nonce all accommodations had been made, choose a person for\na position based on who was the best-qualified or who was\nthe most senior.\nNow, let me say again what --\nQUESTION: Your argument for that, as I\nunderstand it, is the argument that you've repeated in a\ncouple, or your claim that you've repeated in a couple of\ninstances that there would be something fundamentally\nunhinging to the seniority system to allow a disabilities\nexception, and that seems to me in part sort of an\nempirical question.\nI mean, if a company like yours was going to\nhave 100 disability exceptions a month at every terminal,\nyes, I can see it, but is there any reason to believe that\nthe magnitude of the possible disabilities exceptions\nunder reasonable accommodation would be so great as to\nhave that kind of cataclysmic effect on the general\nreliance that employees can place on seniority?\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Souter, that is a good\nquestion that I think would go to whether it was an undue\nhardship.\nQUESTION: Well, it would go to that, but\nwouldn't it -- you know, it would go to --\nMR. DELLINGER: But here, on the question of\nunreasonableness, I think we're looking at a question of\nprinciple. As Judge Posner said in the Seventh Circuit\ndecision, it is a difference not just of cost but of\nprinciple, and here the principle at stake is the interest\nof other employees, so --\nQUESTION: There's no question, to the extent of\nthe exceptions, their interest is going to be discounted\nin some way.\nMR. DELLINGER: And even -- even though we don't\nknow the numbers, because we don't know ultimately how\nbroadly the court will interpret the phrase, disability,\nwhich you have sub judice in other cases, and even them\nwould take some working out. We don't know the numbers,\nbut we do know how it would disrupt the expectations of\nemployees.\nHere, for example, even though we have a bright\nline rule -- we have a bright line rule with promotions.\nEven though promotions are a reassignment to a vacant\nposition, you never have to promote, and that's because\nthere's a good reason, it is thought, that promotions are\nnot a reasonable accommodation. There's an even better\nreason, in my view, not to trump the rights and interests\nof other employees who have earned a right to a position,\nand to try to look, as several of you have in questions,\nas to whether it might be reasonable in a particular\ninstance, I don't know how you place this burden on\nmanagers in a system that is a seniority system to make\nthose complex social judgments not knowing what the domino\neffect is. You could have --\nQUESTION: Well, one thing is easy to see is\nthat if you bump somebody, it's no good. That's not\nreasonable. If somebody, as in this case, is already in\nthe job, you let that person remain in the job, so it's\nnot as though every exercise of seniority rights is of\nequal magnitude. If somebody is trying to bid for that\njob and some senior person otherwise would be laid off,\nthen you say it's unreasonable, but here there isn't such\na situation.\nMR. DELLINGER: That could well be. We don't\nknow what the effect is, because someone will be bumped if\nthey don't get their desired position. For example --\nQUESTION: I thought we know on the facts of\nthis case that it's only a question of, that nobody is\ngoing to be bumped. The question is whether he stays in\nthat job. There were jobs he could have done in cargo, if\nhe weren't disabled.\nMR. DELLINGER: We don't know what the\nconsequences will be, because what Mr. Barnett is\nasking -- and this is from his declaration, which is not\nin the joint appendix, but is at page 3 of his declaration\nof February 28, he says, the intent and potential effect\nof my request was to have the employee who is going to\ndisplace me in the mailroom go around me and bump the next\nless senior position.\nYou could have the following situation. You\ncould have the person who's claiming the job in the\nmailroom could be an older single parent who's finally\nworked out child care arrangements and is entitled by\nseniority to the mailroom position, but who finds out,\nwhen, though she is senior in position, or he is senior in\nposition, that Mr. Barnett is insulated from the normal\noperations system, would have to bump the next position\ndown, which might well be a graveyard shift position, or a\nposition in cargo, which the person was too old to handle\nthe effects of, so you simply --\nQUESTION: What it boils down to, though, is, I\nthink as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, it means that no\none can bump up, but it doesn't mean that anybody gets\nbumped down, and that, there's a -- I mean, she suggests\nthere's a qualitative difference between those two.\nMR. DELLINGER: And I think we don't know that,\nJustice --\nQUESTION: Well, why don't we know that as a\nmatter of logic?\nMR. DELLINGER: Because it could well be that\nthe more senior employee who needs to be in the mailroom,\nshe needs -- her position is being eliminated. She needs\nto be in the mailroom, which has a day shift. She's\nsenior and entitled to it. She can't get it. The next\nsenior position, which she has to take, could be a\ngraveyard shift, or a graveyard shift in cargo. She might\nnot be able to work --\nQUESTION: That's true, but it's still the fact\nthat we know that the effect of following Justice\nGinsburg's suggestion is that no extra person gets bumped\ndown. It's merely that one person doesn't bump up and\nbump the disabled employee down. That we can say with\ncertainty, can't we?\nMR. DELLINGER: It may well be in many instances\nthe bottom-most person will lose their job, and it could\nbe that the more senior person would get a job that\nthey -- that doesn't work out for them.\nQUESTION: But that's going to be a wash no\nmatter how it works.\nMR. DELLINGER: Not necessarily.\nQUESTION: If you have zero-sum -- I mean, if\nyou have a finite number of employees and you're laying\nsomebody off, that's --\nMR. DELLINGER: Under our plan, it won't be that\nmore people will lose jobs, or get their less desired\naccommodation. It will be that the more senior employees\ndo not get the position to which they are entitled, which\nfor complex reasons may be very important to them.\nI'll reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dellinger.\nMs. Center, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAUDIA CENTER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. CENTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are four points that must be made in this\ncase. First of all, the petitioner's proposed definition\nof the term, reasonable accommodation, as meaning fair,\nproper, fit, appropriate, not extreme, not excessive, et\ncetera, et cetera, must be rejected, because that\nconstruction eviscerates all of the statutory defenses, is\ncontrary to all of the regulations, and it is contrary to\nthe listed reasonable accommodations, including\nreassignment.\nSecond, the term reasonable accommodation in the\nADA means a modification that enables the disabled\nemployee to participate that is reasonable to the disabled\nemployee.\nThird, even if you --\nQUESTION: You're -- stopping you at the second\npoint, there, so from your point of view, reasonable\nrelates only to its effect on the employee, not on anybody\nelse?\nMS. CENTER: That's correct.\nThird, even if you disagree with my proposal for\nthe definition of reasonable accommodation, the term must\ninclude the listed reasonable accommodations. Where it\nsays reasonable accommodations may include, those\naccommodations listed, which include reassignment to a\nvacant position, are reasonable accommodations by\ndefinition.\nQUESTION: But the statute says may include. It\ndoesn't say must include. Your definition says must\ninclude?\nMS. CENTER: The may include relates to the\ncase-by-case individualized analysis that must take place.\nAll of the accommodations won't be necessary in every\ncases. The may include relates to the specific needs of\nthe specific individual employee.\nAnd finally, reassignment to a vacant position\nmeans an actual reassignment to a job that is not\ncurrently occupied or that has not already been filled.\nQUESTION: Would you -- Ms. Center, why is it --\nit has been conceded, I gather -- you didn't contest this\nanyway, in your brief, that reasonable accommodation would\nnever include appointment to a promotion to a more -- a\nposition that pays slightly more, even though the amount\nit pays more is negligible, so it's not -- you know, it's\nnot a hardship on the employer. Why is that?\nMS. CENTER: Well, I think there are several\nreasons that the agency, the EEOC has come to that\nconclusion, which I agree with. First of all, the listed\naccommodation is reassignment to a vacant position.\nCongress did not say promotion, and reassignment describes\na lateral transfer, ordinarily.\nQUESTION: Well, but this is a vacant higher\nposition. They didn't exclude that. This is a vacant\nposition at a higher level. Why wouldn't that be\nincluded?\nMS. CENTER: Further, the EEOC regulations\nexplain that the purpose of the reasonable accommodation\nis to enable the disabled employee to enjoy the privileges\nof employment along with similarly situated disable -\nnondisabled employees, to enjoy equal benefits, and if\nthere's a promotion it's sort of -- it's contrary to that\nprinciple.\nQUESTION: Oh, but so is what you're urging\nhere, this -- you're ending up giving the person here\nseniority rights, which exceed those of other employees\nwho have been there a certain amount of time.\nMS. CENTER: Well, in this case the job that Mr.\nBarnett ended up with was equal in terms of, a) he would\nhave been employed, and b) at the same pay and, et cetera,\nthe same level --\nQUESTION: I understand, but --\nMS. CENTER: -- as he would have gotten but for\nhis disability.\nQUESTION: But you can't urge that your system\nassures that the disabled not be given any benefits that\nother employees would not get. You're giving him a\nbenefit that they wouldn't get. They wouldn't be allowed\nto stay in that job, so why can't you do the same thing\nfor a promotion?\nI mean, the other side has a criterion. Their\ncriterion is, it is -- reasonable accommodation is limited\nto accommodation to the disability, so you provide him\nwith a working space that will accommodate the fact that\nhe can't stand up for too long, or you put him in another\njob at the same level that's vacant which doesn't require\nhim to stand up. All of this accommodates the disability,\nthey say.\nWhereas the accommodation you're urging here has\nnothing to do with accommodating the disability. It has\nto do with, I don't know, giving him a different job.\nMS. CENTER: Right, the accommodation is --\nQUESTION: They have a criterion. I don't\nunderstand what your criterion is, except, you know, do\nwhat is reasonable. Why isn't it reasonable to promote\nthe disabled person if it -- it just costs a few more\nbucks. That's the only vacant job left. It's not\nhardship to the employer, so promote him. Why isn't that\nreasonable?\nMS. CENTER: Well, it's -- in addition to the\nreasons I already gave you, the agency has construed\nreassignment to a vacant position to not include\npromotion, and --\nQUESTION: Well, never mind the agency. Maybe\nthe agency was unreasonable.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CENTER: In this case, though, the\naccommodation that Mr. Barnett sought was not more\nseniority. The accommodation was reassignment to a vacant\nposition and not --\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about him, though.\nI'm asking for your theory of the case. What is it that\nmakes an assignment not reasonable, or an accommodation\nnot reasonable?\nMS. CENTER: An accommodation --\nQUESTION: Once you cut it loose from\naccommodating the disability, which is what the other side\nwants to do, once you cut it loose from that, why isn't\neverything up for grabs, including a promotion?\nMS. CENTER: It's not cut loose from the\ndisability. The reasonable accommodation has to be made,\nby the clear a statutory language has to be made to the\nphysical or mental limitations of the disabled employee.\nHere, the reassignment enabled Mr. Barnett to retain --\nwould have enabled Mr. Barnett to retain his employment.\nIt was because of his disability that he was unable to\nperform the job that he was relegated to when the\npositions were put up for bid, so it was through his\ndisability --\nQUESTION: Well, it can -- it can be a\nreasonable accommodation. The question is, is he entitled\nto it in the face of an employer's seniority plan that\nwould put somebody else there instead?\nMS. CENTER: Well, I think that he --\nQUESTION: I think that's the question.\nMS. CENTER: Well, there are -- I think he is\nentitled to that reasonable accommodation if all other\npossibilities are exhausted. If all of the prerequisites\nare met for reassignment, such as there is a vacancy, the\ndisabled employee is qualified, and no statutory defense\nsuch as undue hardship applies, I think he is entitled to\nthe reassignment.\nQUESTION: Even though some other employee on\nthe basis of greater seniority than the respondents under\nthe plan could take that slot?\nMS. CENTER: Yes. I think he's entitled to that\nslot at that point.\nQUESTION: And you don't equate that with the\nsituation of a promotion?\nMS. CENTER: No, it's not a promotion. It's a\nlateral transfer.\nQUESTION: Let me be sure of one thing. The\ncase arises on a summary judgment, and I thought the court\nof appeals held that you were entitled to a trial, not\nthat you were entitled to summary judgment. Are you\nclaiming you are entitled to summary judgment?\nMS. CENTER: No, I'm -- I think that the\nemployer is free to try and present a defense to our claim\nof failure to accommodate. Their defense would be undue\nhardship, or one of the other statutory defenses.\nQUESTION: Does reasonableness go the jury, or\nis there a jury, do you think?\nMS. CENTER: There would be a jury. I think in\nthis case because reasonable accommodation -- because\nreassignment is one of the listed reasonable\naccommodations, the judge could state that reassignment is\na reasonable accommodation, but if you disagree with my,\nyou know, construction of reasonable accommodation, then\nit could go to the jury, I suppose.\nQUESTION: In your summary judgment proceeding,\ndid you challenge, at all, the employer's description of\nthe seniority system?\nMS. CENTER: Yes, there was a challenge to that\ndescription.\nQUESTION: I didn't see it. That is, as far as\nI could see there's an affidavit on the employer's side,\nand Rule 56(e) requires you to point to specific, you\nknow, record evidence or affidavits, et cetera. I didn't\nsee any.\nMS. CENTER: Well, there wasn't -- I -- maybe I\nmisunderstood the question, but there was in the record an\neffort to point out that they had made exceptions to the\nseniority system, that they had amended it --\nQUESTION: As far as I could tell, what I have\nto assume about the system is that it's widespread, it's\nlongstanding, it governs 14,000 employees, the only\nexception is an exception for catastrophic medical\ntransfer, and the -- they say, I guess we have to take it\nas given, that it would require your view would require US\nAir to weigh and balance conflicting claims and personal\ndesires of all US Air agents, and it would interfere with,\nI guess, the alternative child care arrangements,\neducational endeavors, and the ability of other, the other\nemployees to continue working for the company.\nNow, those seem to me the facts. I didn't see\nany refutation of them --\nMS. CENTER: There are additional facts --\nQUESTION: -- and therefore I assume, for\nsummary judgment purposes, I take those as a given, and if\nI'm not supposed to, I'd like to know right now.\nMS. CENTER: There are additional facts, in\naddition to the catastrophic illness exception there is a\nsignificant modification to how to calculate furlough\nseniority. There is a change from department seniority to\ncompany seniority. In addition, as the petitioner has\nconceded, the personnel policy guide containing the\nseniority policy states on its face that it's not a\ncontract, it's merely a --\nQUESTION: No, that's given. I assume it's not.\nMS. CENTER: And the grievance procedure, where\nby employees would bring these seniority matters to the\ncompany's attention, that grievance procedure says, you're\nnot allowed to grieve something that's required by Federal\nlaw, and we get to decide what's required, so in that\ncircumstance it seems to me not reasonable for an employee\nto believe that the job assignment policy is going to\ntrump a legitimate need for reasonable accommodation under\na Federal law.\nQUESTION: Given that statement, to get to\nthis -- what I think of anyway as the heart of this\nmatter, assuming I don't accept your view of reasonable\naccommodation, assuming that I accept the view that\nreasonableness includes the interest of other workers and\nperhaps the interest of management as well, all right,\ngiven that view of it, when you come up with the\ncharacteristics that I've mentioned and that you added to,\nwhy isn't it reasonable for the employer to say, look, if\nI give this person the job, there's an alternative chain I\nhave to bump that really causes disruption in the company.\nIt throws everything up for grabs.\nI can't enforce a seniority system under that\nkind of regime, but even if I could, all these other\nworkers here are going to be disrupted, too, and that's\nwhat makes my seniority system reasonable in the\ncircumstance. Now, your reply to that is precisely what?\nMS. CENTER: The sort of domino effect has been\nvastly overstated by this case by the petitioner. The\nactual impact of this sort of accommodation in this case\nand in other cases is to permit the disabled individual to\nhave one assignment, and then replacing, on the list of\npossible jobs for people to bid on, replacing that\nassignment would be the job that the person left, so each\nreassignment leaves a vacancy to be put on the list of\njobs --\nQUESTION: I don't understand that part of your\nanswer, though I want to hear the rest, because if there\nare 7,000 jobs missing, then it will be 7,000 people at\nthe end of the day without a job, and either you go down\none chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, or you go down\na different chain and bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. The\nharm is precisely the same. It's a question of which\npeople suffer it, so I don't see why there isn't a domino\neffect. It's this chain, or that chain.\nMS. CENTER: Right, but in terms of the\nparticular chain, there's a list of jobs upon which the\nnondisabled employees can bid, and those would include all\nof the jobs that remain vacant after the reassignment, as\nwell as the job that the disabled individual left, so the\nactual impact is modest. It's removing one job on the\nlist and adding a different job on the list.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't it like musical chairs in\na way? I mean, someone is going to lose out to the\ndisabled person.\nMS. CENTER: Someone may get a bob that they\nwould -- a job where they would have preferred another\njob.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct, but no one would\nlose their job because of the reassignment.\nQUESTION: Well, it may be a job -- I mean, it\ndepends. It may be a job that the person can't take, such\nas the person who had arranged from child care, and\nsimply, the only other job available is one that the\nperson cannot do. I mean, that's possible.\nWhy isn't it -- as I read this statute, I don't\nsee anything in it which says that if -- there's plenty in\nit that says we're going to sacrifice some of the\nconvenience of the employers to the needs of the\nhandicapped, but I don't see anything in it that says\nwe're going to sacrifice the expectations of coworkers to\nthe handicapped. Why isn't it a perfectly feasible\nreading of reasonable accommodation to mean an\naccommodation that, among other things, does not defeat\nthe reasonable expectation of fellow employees?\nMS. CENTER: Well, you could conclude that, but\nI think it's -- if you look at the statutory structure, if\nyou looked at the list of reasonable accommodations, if\nyou look at the governing regulations, all of these\nprovisions explain how the equities are weighed in the\nstatutory --\nQUESTION: What is there in any of them that\nshows that Congress envisioned not just putting some\nburden on the employer, but putting some burden on fellow\nemployees?\nMS. CENTER: Well, the --\nQUESTION: I mean, it mentions vacancy only. I\nmean, it mentions vacancy because nobody's hurt if there's\na vacancy, but somebody is hurt if there's a vacancy to\nwhich somebody has seniority entitlement.\nMS. CENTER: Well, the plain language of the\nstatute requires that the employer provide reasonable\naccommodation, and the defense is undue hardship, and so\nthat's how the statute works. If there's no other\npossible accommodation --\nQUESTION: Yes, but if I reject that view of the\nstatute on the one I was taking, I'd still like to know\nwhat the response is to what I think is the main point,\nwhich is not the domino effect. If I paraphrase it, life\nis very difficult in a big company when you lay off 7,000\npeople. It's terrible, and the one think that the 7, the\n14,000 who remain have to be certain about is that there's\na fair system in place, and once we open it to this kind\nof argument, well, it's over.\nYour client has a very bad back. I might think\nthat's somebody that this act should protect, but when we\nget to the reasonable accommodation stage, at that point,\nif all those people are in the act, I can't run my system,\nsays the employer, because the claims for special\nexemption in the bumping will be endless.\nNow, your response to that is what?\nMS. CENTER: Well, if you disagree with our\nreading of the term, reasonable accommodation, the term\nstill would require a case-by-case individualized analysis\nof whether it was reasonable in this situation, and what\nthe petitioner wants is a per se rule for bona fide\nseniority policies, and that's completely contrary to the\nway that the statute works, which is case-by-case\nanalysis.\nQUESTION: -- say that your client could be\nbumped by someone who's more severely handicapped if he\nwere in that position?\nMS. CENTER: I think that each of the\nhandicapped employees would be entitled to reassignment to\na vacant position. If my client was in that position\nalready, it would not be a vacancy, so it wouldn't be\navailable.\nQUESTION: Well, but I -- it's my understanding\nthat these positions are deemed open at some point.\nMS. CENTER: Well I think, then, that the client\nwould be -- the more disabled individual would be entitled\nto reassignment. They both would be entitled to\nreassignment.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- I think you've missed\nmy point. Why wouldn't that person be as entitled to the\nposition that your client occupies temporarily, when as a\npart of his or her reassignment or accommodation,\nreasonable accommodation?\nMS. CENTER: There could be conflicting requests\nfor accommodation, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Would that person be entitled to that\nposition --\nMS. CENTER: There would be a number of ways\nto --\nQUESTION: -- using your argument?\nMS. CENTER: I don't believe that the more\ndisabled employee would be entitled to bump the less-\ndisabled employee. I think that --\nQUESTION: Why?\nMS. CENTER: Why? Because the employee that\nneeds the accommodation continues to need the\naccommodation. The other employee also needs the\naccommodation.\nQUESTION: But you could say that about the\npeople who have the job in the first instance, couldn't\nyou?\nMS. CENTER: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: The person who had that position and\nhad his or her life worked out, day care, et cetera, et\ncetera, also needed that position.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So the argument's the same.\nMS. CENTER: But the argument is that there's a\nFederal law in this case that requires reasonable\naccommodation, including reassignment.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you this. What is your\nclient's disability?\nMS. CENTER: He has a back impairment.\nQUESTION: What does that mean?\nMS. CENTER: He has an orthopedic disability.\nHe has pain, he has problems in his disks.\nQUESTION: Has it been established that he in\nfact qualifies as disabled, or is that something we're\njust assuming arguendo at this stage of the case?\nMS. CENTER: It's disputed. A summary judgment\nmotion was denied on that issue, and so at this point I\nimagine we're assuming arguendo.\nQUESTION: May I ask about a hypothetical that's\nrunning through my mind. Under your opponent's view, as I\nunderstand it, it would be at least theoretically possible\nthat the job your client has occupied up to now, and he\nwants to move because of his disability, would be the job\nmost people on the seniority list would want if it were\navailable, but they could nevertheless say they don't have\nto accommodate. Am I right on that?\nMS. CENTER: Could you ask it one more time?\nI'm sorry.\nQUESTION: It seems to me theoretically possible\nthat he is -- because of his disability, he's leaving a\njob that is a very attractive job for a nondisabled\nperson, and that everybody on the seniority list, if given\nthe choice of jobs, would pick his job, that under your\nopponent's view it would nevertheless -- they could\nnevertheless refuse to accommodate him.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct, and my client, Mr.\nBarnett's goal is not to get the plum job. Mr. Barnett's\ngoal is to get a job that he can do despite his\ndisability, so the purpose is not to prefer the disabled\nemployee. The purpose is to enabled the disabled employee\nto retain employment and to accommodate their limitations.\nQUESTION: But it does have the effect of giving\na preference. That whole list of reasonable\naccommodations -- let's forget a seniority system. One of\nthe accommodations is part-time. Suppose somebody who has\nan exhaustion problem, can't work a full day, and then\nthere's somebody else who says, but I'm a single mom, and\nI've got children at home, and they don't have to\naccommodate to me, I don't understand it.\nYour answer is, well, there's a Federal law and\nit doesn't protect you, but that would create the same\nkind of friction in the workforce. People feel that they\nhave been disadvantaged for no just reason, so -- but all\nthose, what the statute lists as reasonable\naccommodations, every one of those could adversely affect\nsomeone who has in that person's view an equally good\nreason to get the break. It is a preference system.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct. The petitioner\nconcedes that the reasonable accommodation mandate\nrequires employers to do certain things for disabled\nemployees that they may choose not to do for nondisabled\nemployees.\nQUESTION: Sure, but preferring one -- I mean,\ngiving someone a benefit that someone else doesn't get,\nsuch as allowing them to do a certain job sitting down\nwhen everybody else has to do it standing up, or what-\nnot, that doesn't disadvantage the others. That doesn't\ndestroy any of their expectations when they took the job,\nand the same thing with allowing somebody to work part-\ntime. It doesn't help me any that somebody can work part-\ntime now.\nSure, I'm not allowed to do it, just as I'm not\nallowed to do the job sitting down, but it doesn't hurt\nme, whereas what happens here is that the person who had\nan expectation of seniority entitlement to a certain job\nhas been frustrated in that expectation. It seems to me\nthat's quite different. I mean, we're not talking about\nwhether one employee can be preferred over another.\nCertainly, the disabled employee can be.\nBut the question is whether it's a reasonable\naccommodation when it requires you to harm another\nemployee in that employee's job or in that employee's\nlegitimate expectations, and I think that's really what's\nat issue here, whether it's just the employer that's going\nto be inconvenienced by this statute, or other employees\nas well. Why isn't it reasonable to say you cannot\ndestroy the expectations of other employees? What in the\nstatute shows that you can?\nMS. CENTER: Well, it's true that in certain\ncases providing the reassignment to a vacant position ends\nup giving a priority to the employee over a nondisabled\nemployee. That can happen, but that's not the purpose of\nthe accommodation. The purpose of the accommodation is to\nenable the disabled employee to retain their employment,\nwhich directly serves the vocational and the equality\ngoals of the act, and the reverse --\nQUESTION: Yes, but to the extent that you think\nreasonable, the word reasonable and reasonable\naccommodation requires what happens to other employees as\nwell as a result of the accommodation, then you have a\ndifferent question. If you approach it the way you do,\nthat it refers only to what's reasonable for the disabled\nperson, that's different, so we have to decide what\nreasonable accommodation really means, don't we?\nMS. CENTER: And if you do decide that\nreasonable takes into account other employees, in this\ncase the equities really favor Mr. Barnett, because Mr.\nBarnett is the one that faced job loss. The person who\ncame in and bid on Mr. Barnett's job had no compelling\nneed for the job. He was perfectly able to continue doing\nhis existing job, and Mr. Barnett, by contrast, because\nthe accommodation was denied, became inevitably\nunemployed, so the equities will frequently favor the\ndisabled employee who faces job loss, even if you pull out\nreasonable separately like that.\nQUESTION: I hate to belabor the point, Ms.\nCenter, but the more disabled employee, someone who's\nseverely disabled, if that person has to be accommodated\nand we only have to look at that person's needs in making\nour reasonableness determination, I don't understand why\nyour client can't be bumped if he were in that position.\nMS. CENTER: If you pulled out reasonable?\nQUESTION: And only -- and you limited that\ndetermination to the disabled person who has to be\naccommodated.\nMS. CENTER: Well, if you pulled out reasonable\nin that way, I think there'd be a difficulty arguing it\nwould be reasonable to disrupt another effective\naccommodation that's already in place. It might be\nreasonable to do some other things --\nQUESTION: But that's -- then your argument is\nonly different in -- slightly from the argument that you\nhave to take into consideration the disruption that's\ncaused in others' lives when you disrupt the seniority\nsystem.\nMS. CENTER: Well, I think that the disruption,\nas we state in our brief, can be considered in the undue\nhardship defense. It's a detailed defense that's drafted\nto consider all of these factors.\nQUESTION: Well, could we consider the\ndisruption to your client in the undue hardship category?\nMS. CENTER: No. I think the disruption to my\nclient in the job loss is the harm that results from the\nfailure to accommodate.\nQUESTION: But aren't you saying that in the\ncase that Justice Thomas poses you do consider the\ndisruption to your client as well as the interest of the\nmore --\nMS. CENTER: Correct. I misunderstood.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then why don't you do that\nacross the board? In other words, why doesn't -- why\nshouldn't -- why don't you have to concede that\nreasonableness always takes into consideration the\ninterest of other employees?\nMS. CENTER: Because I think that's contrary to\nthe structure of the statute. I think it's contrary to\nthe description of reasonable accommodations. It's\ncontrary to the regulations.\nQUESTION: Yes, but can you find any textual\nbasis in the statute that says when you're dealing with\ncomparative interests of two disabled people you consider\nthe interests of both in determining what is reasonable,\nbut when you're considering the comparative interests of a\ndisabled person and others, you don't consider both?\nMS. CENTER: I was --\nQUESTION: Is there any textual basis for that?\nMS. CENTER: Perhaps I'm still misunderstanding,\nbut I was answering the question assuming that my reading\nof the statute was rejected and that we were looking at\nequities in the word reasonable.\nQUESTION: I see. You weren't conceding -- all\nright, just for argument.\nMS. CENTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Do I misunderstand? I thought you\nhad agreed earlier that it would never be reasonable to\nbump another employee.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay. So you're always talking about\ntransfer to a vacant position. I don't understand the\ncompetition between two disabled persons. Each of them\nhas to be given a vacant job. If the job's already\nfilled, it doesn't matter whether it's filled by another\ndisabled person or by a perfectly healthy person.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct. It will often, I\nthink, just be the chronology, who requests accommodation\nfirst, who gets reassigned, and then you go on to the next\ndisabled employee if there is one and deal with their\naccommodation.\nQUESTION: And the reason you can't bump another\nemployee is that that's unreasonable, is that --\nMS. CENTER: No. The reason is that the\naccommodation listed is reassignment to a vacant position,\nand that vacant language was put in there to prevent\nbumping an occupied position, bumping an individual.\nQUESTION: Well, if you -- what you've said,\nyou're making of this statute in this respect something\ndifferent from, in title VII, where you have past proven\ndiscrimination, so the employer may have to give a remedy,\nthat remedy may adversely affect other people, and the\ncalculus that the Court has to make is, yes, they can be\nhurt, but not too much, and isn't that exactly what is\ngoing on here?\nIf we reject your client-centered interpretation\nof reasonable, it's just the same thing.\nNondiscrimination, this statute goes beyond\nnondiscrimination. It requires reasonable accommodation.\nWhat's reasonable? Of course, you always have to take\ninto account the interests of other people.\nMS. CENTER: That's correct. If we -- if the\nCourt rejects my view of the term, reasonable\naccommodation, you'd have to take into account all of\nthose considerations, but you could not adopt, I don't\nbelieve, the per se rule suggested by the petitioner that\nneutral, you know, selection criteria are always going to\ntrump the ADA.\nFor example, your part-time working scenario,\nthat could be eliminated by a neutral rule that no one can\nwork less than full-time, so that can't be the rule. If\nit's reasonable, pulled out and looked at in the different\ncriteria, then it has to be case-by-case. It can't simply\nbe deference to a neutral selection criteria.\nQUESTION: When I got the case by case, I look\nat the record here, and it doesn't seem to me as if your\nclient wants to prove anything. They'll accept what the\nother side says about it as we discussed, and then we just\nhave to decide in this case, is that enough or not. Is\nthat right?\nMS. CENTER: Well, I think there are a number of\nitems in the record that show that the actual disruption\nto the employer, as well as the impact on other employees,\nwould have been extremely modest, and that retaining Mr.\nBarnett in the job he'd been successfully performing for\nyears was -- would have been an entirely reasonable\naccommodation, if you want to pull out reasonable.\nQUESTION: It's not a matter of proof. We're at\nthe pretrial stage.\nMS. CENTER: Well, that's true, and there's\ncertainly sufficient evidence under Reeves for our client\nto have a trial on that issue, should --\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Center.\nMS. CENTER: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, you have 2 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, when it comes\nto filling positions, which is fundamentally different, I\nthink, than adding other elements, there's nothing\nanomalous about a per se rule, nor is that inconsistent\nwith giving individualized considerations. The rehab act\nand title VII both said that you don't displace seniority\nsystems.\nIn Hardison v. TWA, this Court did not say you\nhave to ask whether the more senior employee's reason for\nneeding the Saturday off was either trivial or serious.\nWhen it comes to positions, there is a good reason for\nletting the more senior employee choose the more desirable\nposition. I don't think either the line managers or the\nNinth Circuit engaging in an individual case-by-case\nassessment could possibly make that a workable system.\nThe notion that there's no one who's going to be\nhurt reduces to this, that when the more senior employee\nclaims the position under the regular operation of the\nstatute, their response is to say, well, that more senior\nemployee can always go and be a cargo handler on the night\nshift. We don't know that. We don't know if that would\nwork.\nIn effect what you're doing when you promote\nsomebody to a greater seniority priority is that you are\npromoting, and we do know that however reasonable it might\nbe in a particular case, if you did an intensive case-by-\ncase thing to say, why don't we promote this person to the\nsecretarial supervisor, that itself is never required,\nbecause we think that in a sense you're really going to\nlose your way in trying to manage a company if you move\naway from bedrock proposition that an employer is never\nrequired to choose the less-qualified or the less-senior\nperson once they've made all the other accommodations.\nThat would be a major social change.\nThere is an argument that someone who loses one\nposition because of a disability ought to have a priority\nclaim for another position even over someone who is more\nqualified or more senior for it. That would be a major\npolicy change that we -- for which there are arguments for\nand against. The Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nDellinger.\nMR. DELLINGER: Thank you.\n"
