        "content": "(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Hill v. McDonough.\nMr. Doss.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF D. TODD DOSS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DOSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Nelson v. Campbell, this Court held that a\nchallenge to procedures to execute an inmate may be\nbrought in a section 1983 action unless the challenge\nwould necessarily prevent the State from carrying out\nits execution. Mr. Hill does not challenge the State's\nright to execute him by lethal injection, but instead,\nonly challenges the particular protocol Florida\nDepartment of Corrections in their discretion has\nadopted. Mr. Hill's claim, thus, does not necessarily\nprevent his execution, and his claim falls squarely\nwithin the scope of Nelson, as announced by this Court.\nThe current claim -- the only focus of that\nclaim is the discretionary choice of the particular\ninjection procedure that has been chosen by the Florida\nDepartment of Corrections. Therefore, it does not\nviolate Nelson because the relief sought would not\nnecessarily prevent the State of Florida from carrying\nout its execution. The State could still carry out the\nexecution through a more humane means by altering the\nparticular protocol that -- that they have adopted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which you decline to\nspecify. Right?\nMR. DOSS: I'm sorry, Justice. I didn't hear\nthe first part of your question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By a means which you decline\nto specify, so that if they come up with some other\nmeans, you could -- you could object to that as well I\nassume.\nMR. DOSS: Well, there -- in -- in answer to\nyour question, there's never been a -- a requirement\nthat a section 1983 plaintiff must plead a\nconstitutionally acceptable alternative.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand that. But\nI'm just -- I'm just pointing out what -- what becomes\navailable to you if we -- if we give you the relief you\nrequest.\nMR. DOSS: Well, this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- we -- we say this --\nthis procedure is no good. The State comes up with\nanother procedure, and you challenge that one. Right?\nAnd -- and another few years go by.\nMR. DOSS: I -- I respectfully disagree with\nthe fact that it would just leave open a total series\nof challenges.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. DOSS: The State -- the State would have\nthe opportunity to come in and propose a acceptable\nalternative. Just like any other finding of\nunconstitutionality, once they propose that\nalternative, we can challenge that if something is --\nis not acceptable, or accept the -- the proposed\nalternative and the court enters a -- a consent decree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you think that the --\nthe way you would proceed in trial court is the trial\ncourt finds that this is no good, and -- and then the\ntrial court proposes an alternative, or -- or invites\nthe State to propose to the trial court an alternative,\nand then asks whether you agree to that alternative.\nAnd if you don't, the trial court makes the decision\nwhether the alternative is -- is constitutional or not.\nMR. DOSS: This -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not bad.\nMR. DOSS: -- that's entirely correct, and I\nthink we've seen that in -- in a couple of the cases\nthat are out there. Mr. Brown's case out of North\nCarolina followed that track. Mr. Morales' case\nsomewhat followed that track, although through no fault\nof Mr. Morales, California wasn't able to carry through\non the alternative that they chose because the\nanesthesiologists decided to not participate. But it\n-- but it just proceeded to basically an up or down\nruling upon the proposed alternatives. So I -- I would\ndisagree that there's a seriatim effect of -- of just\nperpetual litigation over whether the alternatives --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're envisioning that\none case will take care of it. That is, if the Court\nrules against you, that's the end of it. You can't\ncome back with another inadequacy because you'd be\nbarred by claim preclusion.\nOn the other hand, if the State comes up with\nan acceptable alternative, you agree to it. That's one\nthing. The Court holds -- but there wouldn't be a\nsecond episode I think. One way or another this\nproceeding would end it.\nMR. DOSS: The only -- the only way I would\nforesee a second episode is if they -- if they proposed\na second unconstitutional procedure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that probably\nwill be what will be alleged. Of course, you don't\nknow when -- at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we\nrule in your favor, what alternative the State is going\nto provide, and I am willing to bet whatever that\nalternative is that it will be subject to a challenge\nunder a new 1983 suit. There would be no claim\npreclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was\nat this point. Right?\nMR. DOSS: That's correct, although it would\nproceed to basically an up or down ruling, just as it\ndid in -- in the Brown case and the -- the Morales\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In this very case, you're\nsaying the court would -- would rule on the State's\nproposed alternative. Right?\nMR. DOSS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if you disagreed with\nthat, you could appeal it up again. Right? You can go\nto the court of appeals --\nMR. DOSS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then seek cert up\nhere. Right?\nMR. DOSS: That -- that would be correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- just as a -- maybe\nthis is technical, but what did you ask for for relief?\nDid you ask for relief that the State be enjoined from\nusing this method, or that the State be enjoined from\nexecuting him until an acceptable method had been\nfound? Because in the first case, the door\ntheoretically is open to seriatim 1983 actions, and in\nthe second case, presumably the issue would be resolved\nin this one case, as you suggest. So which did you ask\nfor? Injunction against this or injunction until an\nacceptable alternative came up?\nMR. DOSS: We asked for -- for two -- two\ninjunctions: one a preliminary injunction allowing the\n-- the Court to be able to consider the case, and then\nthe way the prayer for relief was worded is, is that we\nasked for a permanent injunction barring the State of\nFlorida from executing Mr. Hill as they currently\nintend.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that's -- if that's\nthe relief you get, then the door would be open to\nsuccessive different 1983 actions every time the State\ncomes up with -- with a new protocol. Whereas, if what\nthe -- if -- if the trial court -- if you succeed at\nthis stage, if we say, yes, you're -- you're properly\nin court and you go ahead and litigate it, if the trial\ncourt, in fact, awards not the injunction that you\nasked for but the injunction saying do not execute this\nperson until a constitutional protocol has been\nproposed and accepted by the court, then everything\nwill get resolved in this one action, as you suggest.\nSo would -- would you consent to -- as it\nwere, to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that\nthe injunction will be in such a form that everything\ncan get resolved in this one case?\nMR. DOSS: In -- in the sense of -- of the\nState of Florida proposing a -- a -- hopefully a\nconstitutional way of executing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. DOSS: -- Mr. Hill, where it wouldn't\ngive rise to another 1983 action?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. DOSS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you would agree to\nthat?\nMR. DOSS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you have\nconfidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do you have confidence\nthat Florida can do that?\nMR. DOSS: Based upon the litigation that\nwe've seen around the country, yes, I think there are\nacceptable ways to -- to do it out there. Whether they\nwould choose that way or not, I don't know because the\nway Florida's system is designed is -- is that it's not\nstatutorily mandated as to -- as to particular\nprotocol that's utilized. It's left totally with the\nSecretary of the Florida Department of Corrections.\nIt's not subject to any rulemaking or any\nadministrative procedures as far as promulgating those\nrules. It's -- it's just within the Secretary's\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, one -- one of the\ncircumstances that -- that was raised by the\nquestioning is this. States generally have the defense\nof laches. They -- they require the petition to be\nfiled within a reasonable time. With changes in\npharmacology, the laches defense will not usually be\navailable. And under the proposal that the -- the\nState resolves it once and for all, I suppose the State\ncouldn't adopt a new protocol that it thought was\nbetter, more humane, without risking more litigation.\nSo it -- it really is a disincentive for the States to\ntry to make the procedure less painful for the -- for\nthe accused.\nMR. DOSS: Well, within -- within the Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence of -- of the evolution of -- of\nEighth Amendment jurisprudence, we've seen hanging go\nby the wayside. We've effectively seen electrocution\ngo by the wayside. As we advance as a society and as\nwe advance within our knowledge of what's going on --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Precisely. And that's\ngoing to be true with every new protocol.\nMR. DOSS: That's an -- that's an evolution\nover time. It's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said there were other\nStates. You mentioned California. There was a\nproposal by the State. It couldn't be executed. What\nwas the experience -- you mentioned a couple of other\ncases where the particular combination of drugs was\nsuccessfully challenged, but then the State did what?\nMR. DOSS: In Mr. Brown's case in North\nCarolina, my understanding was -- is that the State had\nwent and purchased a device to make sure that he was\nactually unconscious during the procedure and wasn't\nsubject to the excruciating pain that's been detailed\nwithin -- within the briefs. That actually was\nchallenged because Mr. Brown's attorneys didn't think\nthat the -- the people that were monitoring the machine\nwere properly trained. The court ruled against them,\nand as we know, Mr. Brown was -- was executed. It\ndidn't result in the series of challenges as -- as many\nare obviously concerned about.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you agree that that was\nnot a -- that method of execution is not a violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment?\nMR. DOSS: As far as using the machinery that\nwas used in Brown?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. DOSS: I -- I don't know enough about --\nabout that machine to -- to accurately comment on -- on\nthat. I know that the challenges that were brought in\nBrown wasn't necessarily regarding the machine itself,\nbut it was the qualifications of -- of the people\nmonitoring the machine and whether they had the\nauthority and ability to intervene in the execution\nitself. And I believe that that was the challenge that\nwas ruled upon by the court in Mr. Brown's case before\nhe was executed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you know of any method\nthat has been used -- used throughout the country that\nis not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?\nMR. DOSS: As far as -- as far as this\nparticular protocol, this particular protocol that's --\nthat's utilized and that we're -- we're challenging is\nunconstitutional because of the excruciating pain. If\nthe -- if the sedative works, and there's no -- and --\nand the person is not in -- not in wanton and\ngratuitous type of -- of pain, as -- as this Court's\nprecedents hold, that would be constitutional. It's\nthe -- it's the evidence that's coming forward that\nthis is not what's happening that gives rise to our\nclaim that -- that we would like to be able to litigate\nin a 1983 action so that we can get those facts before\nthe court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it only excruciating pain\nthat the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain?\nDoes the Eighth Amendment require painless execution?\nMR. DOSS: No, absolutely not. It's -- it's\nthat it's -- it's that it's wanton and -- and\ngratuitous pain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say wanton\nand gratuitous, you're -- you're saying any pain that\ncan be eliminated must be eliminated. Otherwise, it's\ngratuitous I assume.\nMR. DOSS: It's -- it's gratuitous when it's\nbeyond what's -- what's necessary, and whenever the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. So if there's any way\nof -- of execution that is totally painless, that --\nthat must be pursued.\nMR. DOSS: If there were a way to do that, I\n-- I would agree with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you derive\nthat from? I mean, gee, you know, that -- that was\ncertainly never the principle evident in -- in\nexecutions in the past. Hanging was -- was not a --\nyou know, a quick and easy way to go. You would have\nthought they would have required a firing squad instead\nor something like that. I -- I just don't know where\nyou're deriving this principle that there cannot be any\npain associated with the execution.\nMR. DOSS: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand\nexcruciating pain, but -- but you -- you want to press\nit to the point where there can't be any pain\nassociated. Any pain that can be eliminated must be\neliminated. That seems to me a very extreme\nproposition.\nMR. DOSS: The -- the -- what -- what we've\ndetailed here in our complaint is an extreme and\ntortuous method of -- of death. At this point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I understand what\nyou're challenging here. But what -- what alternative\nwould be acceptable to you? Only one -- only one that\n-- that, to the maximum extent possible, eliminates all\npain. Isn't that right?\nMR. DOSS: Well, when you look at the -- when\nyou look at -- at Morales and Brown, both of those that\n-- that were proposed were eliminating -- for instance,\none of the options within Mr. Morales' case was that\nonly the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the\npancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride. The\nState of California, for -- for whatever reason, did\nnot -- did not choose that and went, instead, and tried\nto use the same protocol and bringing in\nanesthesiologists that were properly trained and\nqualified to determine whether or not Mr. Morales was,\nin fact, anesthetized to -- to a degree where he would\nnot feel that pain. That -- that is -- that is an\nexample of a proper procedure being -- being come up\nwith -- or being dealt with.\nAs well, Mr. Brown -- and -- and thing is, is\nthat for -- there's -- there's never been a requirement\nfor -- for us to plead this. The reason being is -- is\nthis Court's case law within -- for example, Lewis v.\nCasey shows the -- the strong deference that this Court\ngives to States in -- in coming up with the prison\nprocedures. That's not an execution case, but here the\nFlorida courts -- not Florida courts, but the Florida\nofficials within the Department of Correction -- they\nknow their facilities. They know what's capable of --\nof being done there or not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be -- if --\nif in the future, if States specify the method of\nexecution in the sentence, then you would not have a\n1983 action. Is that correct? Because you would then\nbe challenging the sentence, and it would have to be\nbrought under habeas.\nMR. DOSS: If the particular protocol that was\nalleged in the sentence, yes, it would be ripe at that\npoint in time as opposed to Florida's system where it's\nwithin -- it's within the discretion of the Department\nof Correction to change it at any time. We've seen\nthat happen whenever the electric chair litigation was\ngoing on, that they changed these procedures over time,\nadding and detracting different things.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but you -- you\n-- their procedure was set forth in a -- in a notice, a\nregulation or something. You -- you had notice of what\nprocedure they intended to use several years ago,\ndidn't you?\nMR. DOSS: The only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you're saying they\ncould change it in the future, but sure, of course.\nAny -- any agency can change its -- its regulations.\nBut didn't you know that this is the procedure they\nintended to use several years ago?\nMR. DOSS: No, Your Honor. It was -- what\nthey relied upon was what was -- what was detailed in\nSims, which was 6 years ago. But with the -- with the\ndiscretion that Florida Department of Corrections has\nand that they've exhibited in the past, that they've\nutilized that discretion whenever we were having the\nelectric chair litigation going on, we can't presume\nthat.\nThe added problem is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to wait to --\nyou have to wait to the eve of execution before --\nbefore you think you have a -- a ripe claim under --\nunder habeas.\nMR. DOSS: Under -- under Florida's scheme,\nyes, we have to wait because they have the complete\ndiscretion. We have no access to be able to get the\npublic records. In fact, we've been denied throughout.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress has the complete\ndiscretion to change the statutes it's enacted, but\nthat doesn't mean that you can't change -- you can't\nchallenge a statute now because it might be changed\nbefore -- before the action you want to take occurs.\nYou can challenge it now. And it seems to me it's the\nsame thing with the method of execution prescribed by\n-- by an administrative agency in -- in a State.\nMR. DOSS: If Congress has the situation set\nup that Florida does not engage in -- in rulemaking.\nThey don't go through an orderly administrative\nprocess, taking public input and having people come and\nparticipate in that. It's totally --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what did they have?\nThere was the Sims case. No -- no -- certainly not in\nthe legislation. There's no rule that emerges. But\nyou did know that there was a lethal injection\nprocedure that had been prescribed for another\nprisoner, and yet you didn't challenge the lethal\ninjection at that time. Why did you wait until so\nlate?\nMR. DOSS: Because -- because that claim was\nnot ripe at that time, because we didn't know what\nwould be utilized whenever it came to Mr. Hill being\nexecuted. Our knowledge as to how Florida Department\nof Corrections utilizes that discretion has been that\nthey actually used that discretion in the past. We\nhave not been able to get any records post-Sims\nregarding their procedures, regarding the protocol --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have they, in fact,\nchanged the procedure for the lethal injection?\nMR. DOSS: I don't have any public records to\n-- to be able to say one way or another. We were\ndenied all public records whenever we were proceeding\nin State court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When did you ask for the\npublic -- when did you ask for the -- a -- a statement\nof the protocol that would be used in your case?\nMR. DOSS: It was December the 8th is\nwhenever it began, and then pursuant to the court's --\nthe trial court's order that was entered in that case,\nthe State's response came on December 19th. The court\nruled on December 23rd. The rehearing was denied on\nthe 30th, and we filed our briefs in the Florida\nSupreme Court on January 3rd.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. How did\nyou get into the court if you didn't know what protocol\nthey were going to use?\nMR. DOSS: Once --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say you didn't know it\nuntil the 19th when your case was already in the court.\nWhat -- what were you challenging?\nMR. DOSS: What we -- what had happened is --\nis whenever the -- whenever the death warrant was\nsigned on November 29th, that put into play Florida\nRule of Criminal Procedure 3.852(h)(3) which then\nentitles us to more records that we are not entitled to\nbefore a warrant is signed. At -- at that point, we\nfiled our records request, and the trial court, indeed,\nput forth their order as to when everybody was to\nrespond and have various pleadings in. We --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How did the\ntrial court get into it? Does the records request go\nthrough -- through a trial court?\nMR. DOSS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the -- the\naction that you're bringing? An action for records\nrequest?\nMR. DOSS: Yes. It's under Florida Rule of\nCriminal Procedure. It's geared specifically to death-\nsentenced individuals as opposed to being -- we don't\nhave available what's under Florida statute. Chapter\n119 is not available to a death-sentenced inmate. So\nwe must proceed through the 3.852 procedures, and that\nwas not activated until the point in time that the\nwarrant was actually signed.\nWe filed other pleadings in the court that\nwere denied regarding mental retardation, regarding a\nRoper claim, and various other -- other claims.\nUltimately, we also filed in regards to the\npublic records claim and us being denied the public\nrecords and the ability to assess the protocol.\nFlorida --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you to\nclarify one thing? I take it, at this point, there\nisn't any question about the -- the amounts and\ningredients that will be used in -- if -- if the\nexecution goes forward. But my recollection is that\nyou said that your -- your request for a specification\nof this formula or protocol was denied by Florida. Did\nyou ever, as a result of your records request or\notherwise, get a statement directly from Florida to you\nthat the following proportions of chemicals will be\nused?\nMR. DOSS: Within the -- within the public\nrecords proceeding, it was referenced that it would be\nthe same as -- as Sims. Florida Department of\nCorrections --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But until you went into that\nproceeding, I take it, you had asked Florida to specify\nand Florida said, no, it would not do so?\nMR. DOSS: We had asked for the records and\nhad requested the records that would specify and any\nwritten procedures and protocol, as well as the records\nfrom -- from prior executions. They fought that and\nprevailed in the trial court.\nAnd in the Florida Supreme Court, we had also\nsought records from the medical examiner that does the\nautopsies on executed individuals, as well as various\nother officials we thought might have information. We\nwere -- we were given nothing and they objected to us\nreceiving any records whatsoever.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did you ever say to\n-- to any Florida official, please tell me what the\nchemicals are and the amounts that will be used --\nMR. DOSS: We --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- not asking for records,\njust asking for a statement about what they were going\nto do?\nMR. DOSS: It -- it came forward at the -- at\nthe hearing regarding the public records that it was\ngoing to be the Sims -- that it was going to be the\nSims procedure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I guess before you went\ninto court with a public records action, did you ever\nsay to somebody, tell us what you're going to do?\nMR. DOSS: By our public records request,\nyes. If -- if Your Honor is asking if I spoke to the\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what I'm getting at\nis --\nMR. DOSS: -- Department of Corrections, no.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- there -- there are ways\nto find out. One would be to ask. One would be to\nchop the door down with an ax to find out if there's a\nstatement hidden inside. Did you ever try the easy way\nand simply say to them, will you specify for us what\nyou're going to do and how you're going to do this?\nMR. DOSS: That was essentially done at the\npublic records hearing on December 19th whenever they\ncame in and said it was -- that it was Sims.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. DOSS: The -- the thing is, is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you\nalleged in your complaint -- I'm looking at footnote 3\n-- that you assumed they were going to follow the same\nprotocol as in Sims.\nMR. DOSS: Because of their -- because of --\nof the representations that were made during the public\nrecords litigation. That was based upon -- that was\nwhat we based our assumption on, knowing that they\nstill had the ability to change it all the way up until\nthe date that Mr. Hill was scheduled to be executed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they still do, but\nyou're here. I mean, they -- they still have the\nopportunity to change it, but you're here challenging\nit even though it is still changeable. Right?\nMR. DOSS: They -- yes. Because of the way\nFlorida operates with the total discretion and -- and\nthe refusal to give any public records regarding this,\nyes, we are in the dark regarding it. They could --\nthey could alleviate that situation by doing an\nadministrative rulemaking process, that that rule is\nthen in place, and with that rule in place, it would be\nripe at that point because at that point they're\nconstrained to follow the rule as opposed to having the\nliberty to -- to change the procedures as they -- as\nthey deem fit at the last minute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just clarify one\nthing for myself? Do I correctly understand that the\nFederal district court -- I'm not talking about the\nState court -- did not rule on the merits of your\nclaim, but merely held that 1983 is not the proper\nmethod of pursuing the claim?\nMR. DOSS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that there hasn't been a\ndecision by a Federal judge on whether or not there's\nmerit to your case.\nMR. DOSS: That is correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's just a question of\nwhich -- whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or\nby 1983.\nMR. DOSS: That is -- that is correct, and it\nwas recharacterized as -- as a successive habeas\npetition rather than a 1983 action.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I suppose it's entirely\npossible that if the judge then decided it is really --\nif we said it should have been a 1983 action, the judge\ncould say, well, okay, even under 1983 the State has\nthe defense of laches and you still lose. I mean, you\n-- we don't know what's going to happen if we find out\n-- if we agree with what your argument in this Court\nis. Is that right?\nMR. DOSS: It would go back for -- for an\nanalysis as to the equities of the situation, and --\nand that being an intensely fact-bound procedure, the\ndistrict court is actually in -- in a better position\nto go ahead and -- and be able to make that analysis\nthere at the district court level, a Gomez analysis as\nto the equities that are involved within the situation.\nSo as -- as we sit here today, there has not\nbeen any ruling on the merits of -- of this, and there\nhasn't been any evidence produced in -- in any court\nthrough testimony whatsoever regarding the issues of\nthe protocol and -- and things of -- of that nature\nthat we've been discussing here this morning.\nAnd I think that -- that whenever -- whenever\nyou -- you look at -- actually if the Court doesn't\nhave any more questions, I'm going to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Snurkowski, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN M. SNURKOWSKI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe State is here today to suggest that the\nmethod that -- to challenge these claims is by habeas\ncorpus, and that the Federal district court, as well as\nthe Eleventh Circuit, was correct in finding that the\ndistrict court had correctly found it had no\njurisdiction because, in fact, it was a functional\nequivalent of the habeas corpus.\nBut to -- to address some of the issues that\nwere currently brought before the Court today with\nregard to the ability of the defendant to come forward\nand discern what exactly was the method by which\nFlorida was intending to execute him, the record bears\nout that, in fact, the Sims case was in the public\ndomain and, in fact, is the method by which Florida\ndoes execute individuals. There was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no statute and\nthere's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: These -- there is no\nspecific statute. The statute itself merely says that\nlethal injection is the method by which Florida is to\nexecute individuals.\nThe Department of Corrections, through\nrulemaking process internally, provides protocols for\nthe execution day and other protocols with regard to\nthe execution team performing its function on that\ngiven day and -- and hours leading up to that. And\nthat has not been changed nor modified, nor has it been\nchallenged --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is no statute,\nno regulation. That means the executive can do what it\nwill. There's nothing that binds them to the way it\nwas done in Sims' case.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: That is correct, to the\nextent that there's no statutory provision or\nregulatory rule because, in fact, under Florida -- the\nFlorida legislature has exempted rulemaking of the\nDepartment of Corrections with regard to executions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I suppose that's --\nthat's the complaint. If there was a procedure in\nplace, we could address it. If Florida reserves to\nitself the ability to change at any time, well, that's\n-- we want to be told what it will be in our particular\ncase so we have a target that we can aim at.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: And I understand that, but\nthe State would contend that based on the fact that\nthere have 16 executions since the time that Sims has\noccurred and all those executions have been performed\nexactly as the manner in which Sims has occurred, and\nthat there has not been any challenge to a deviance\nfrom that, and in fact, the Florida Supreme Court has\nratified again in this case, when Mr. Hill brought his\nEighth Amendment claim, that Sims was the method of\nexecution in Florida, I think we have a very reasoned\ndetermination that, in fact, the method of execution,\nas it has been proposed in Sims, is currently the\nmethod of execution that we utilize.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what he -- I -- I take\nit the ripeness issue is -- he delayed in bringing it\nbecause he wasn't certain what you'd do. And -- and\none of the reasons, I think, would be that it's only\nrecently there was an article in the Lancet --\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that says the -- in the\nopinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant\nnumber of executed people are conscious when they die,\nand that's painful.\nAnd then it's been suggested there are ways\naround that. Just give them more sodium pentothal or\nhave a doctor or somebody there to make certain the\nindividual is unconscious at the time that the death-\ncausing drugs take effect.\nAll right. Now, that doesn't seem too\ndifficult. Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem\ntoo difficult. So why can't they think, you know,\nFlorida -- they can read there too. They have people\nwho read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just\ndo it. They don't have any real interest in -- in\ncausing suffering. Why don't they just do it?\nAnd so he thinks, up until the last minute,\nthat maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold,\nwhen the death warrant is actually executed, it now\nbegins to appear that they won't. And therefore, at\nthat time, he brings the case.\nNow, I've spun out a story which seems\nprobable, but if it's true, it would be very\nunderstandable why this wasn't ripe before the\nexecution warrant is issued and thereafter it is. Now,\nwhat is your reply on the ripeness question?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, my reply on the\nripeness question is, first of all, that I don't\nbelieve that your scenario -- while I'll accept your\nscenario as your scenario, it is not accurate with\nregard to what occurred in Florida.\nBut apart from that, there has not been a\nchange and nor has there been any allegations by the\ndefendant. He certainly, as you have indicated, could\nhave read and, in fact, did read the Lancet article and\nmade no statements with regard to his allegations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- my -- my little story was\ninaccurate as to Florida or accurate as to Florida.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the kind of thing I was\nexplaining why it would be ripe I think -- is that\naccurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what\nhappened in Florida?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: No. And my answer, I would\nsuggest to you, is no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: -- because I think it's part\nof the pleadings. I mean, he certainly had the\nwherewithal. If he felt that there was another manner\nby which it could have been changed or that the\nDepartment of Corrections, in this particular instance,\nwas suddenly going to -- now aware of the Lancet\narticle, would change its method, he has not made any\nallegations of that, nor has he asked. And that was\none of the questions that was postulated to him, the\nfact that in -- that he never asked.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would he have to come up\n--\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with, as you suggest,\nan alternative that would be acceptable? Suppose there\nhad been a hearing and it was proved more probable than\nnot that in some cases -- not in all, but in some cases\n-- use of this injection would cause excruciating pain.\nWould the Petitioner who is objecting being exposed to\nthat have to come up with an alternative in order to\navoid the risk of excruciating pain?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, it seems to me, based\non this Court's decision in Nelson, that that was the\nfocal point of why relief was granted in the fashion it\nwas, that it was a proper issue to rely in 1983\nbecause, in fact, there might be a -- he had proposed a\nmechanism that might be alternative mechanism that was\naccepted by the government. In this instance, it's --\nthe record is silent and -- which goes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, my question to you\nis -- I take it you're answering yes, that if they\nprove that some people will be subject to excruciating\npain, that's not good enough unless the Petitioner\nproposes an alternative, that it's all right for the\nState to expose someone to the risk of what has -- what\nhas been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain\nas long as the Petitioner himself doesn't come up with\nan alternative.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, I think the answer is\ntwofold. First of all, the fact that the articles out\nthere reflect that there's a potential that that could\nhappen, there's not been evidence that it has occurred\nor has happened, which has been necessarily what is the\nprecursor to when there has been changes in the method\nof execution because there has been a history where, in\nfact, a botched execution has occurred no matter what\nthe method may have been.\nThe second part is that there has not be a --\na specific showing in this particular case, nor an\nallegation for that matter, that any kind of event in\nthis particular case would, in fact, cause excruciating\nor any kind of pain --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, because there's been\nno hearing. We've never gotten past is this -- can you\nopen the door through 1983, and I -- I still don't\nunderstand what your answer is to my question.\nNow, I'm supposing that we do have the 1983\nhearing, and the judge says, yes, I agree with the\nPetitioner's experts. In some cases there will be\nexcruciating pain. Then you say, but, Judge, they\nhaven't come up with an alternative.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge says, you're\nboth right. Some people have excruciating pain, but\nthere's been no alternative suggested. Bottom line of\nthat particular case would be?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: That, in fact, I think that\nhe has to make some colorable showing of an alternative\nthat would be acceptable to him based on the procedures\nbecause, again, the second prong of that seems to me --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the answer is yes.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The court, having found\nthat some people will be subject to excruciating pain,\nstill no Eighth Amendment violation because the\nPetitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the source of his\nobligation to do this? I mean, why does he have an\nobligation under the Eighth Amendment or under any\nother ground to tell the State how to execute people?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, I think the Court in\nits Nelson opinion suggested that that was a means --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that was a fact in\nNelson, but my question to you is if -- if we were to\nagree with you and say that that, in fact, is a -- is\nan element of a 1983 action here, what would be the\nsource of -- of the -- the conclusion that -- that he\nhas to propose a less painful alternative?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: I guess part of the source\nwould be the fact that in overcoming the qualifications\n-- while maybe his pleading may be simple, the notion\nis that he has to overcome those things that may have\nhappened in the past. For example, in this particular\ninstance, whether in fact there's been any violation as\nto a -- a res judicata, collateral estoppel --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I mean, that's not\n-- that's not the issue. I'm not asking you about res\njudicata. I'm saying that if he comes into court and,\nas Justice Ginsburg suggested in her hypo, his experts\ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of the fact finder that\nthere will, in a certain number of cases, be\nexcruciating pain, and he is at least within the risk\nof that, your response is we're still -- that is no\ngrounds for enjoining the execution under 1983. We can\nstill execute unless he comes up with a proposal for a\nless painful way of doing it.\nAnd what I want to know is, why does he have\nsuch an obligation? Why isn't it enough for him to show\nthat there is a probability that he will suffer\nexcruciating pain?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, I think for one point,\nit would be that, in fact, if the State had chosen or\nselected a method or a change in the modification of\nthe method that was not acceptable to him, then we'd be\nstill back at square zero --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Justice Souter and\nJustice Ginsburg can protect their own questions.\nPart of that allegation in here is that the\nState wasn't forthcoming with the -- with -- with the\ninformation requested, and you're not very forthcoming\nwith the answers. What is the source, what is the\nlegal source, what is the precedent for the proposition\nthat the -- that the condemned man has to come up with\nan alternative? What case do you cite? What principle\ndo you cite?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: The principle I'm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we're asking.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Yes, Your Honor. And I'm\nsorry that I was in any way disingenuous.\nBut the bottom line is I think that Nelson is\nthe bottom line source of -- of concern that we would\nbring forth to this Court that if, in fact --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it was mentioned -- it\nwas mentioned in Nelson. But what would be the reason\nfor -- for elevating that -- that fact in Nelson to a\nrequirement? What is the legal principle that would\nsupport your argument?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: I think the legal principle\nbeing that the individual who is coming forth and\nseeking to have the execution or requesting some relief\n-- he has to come forward with some evidence, some --\nsome body of law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there evidence in\n-- I noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call\nour attention to the statute that prohibits the\neuthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a\ncertain procedure. So there must have been a\nlegislative feeling that unless that procedure were\nfollowed, there's a risk of undue pain to the dogs and\ncats. Why isn't there a similar basis for believing\nthat if you don't follow a similar procedure that such\na risk might be present for human beings?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: And that -- that has been an\nallegation and that has been raised before the courts\nover the years with regard to that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what's your response to\nit?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: That, in fact, recent --\nrecent development -- and I mean, we're talking about\nan area that has not -- we have not gotten that far.\nWe don't have a record.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your procedure, if I\nunderstand it, would be prohibited to be applied to\ndogs or cats.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: But the procedure -- that\nprocedure -- there is -- there is legal information or\n-- or scientific information out there that -- or --\nrefutes that, and that, in fact, there's a different\nmechanism and that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, at least it was\nsufficiently convincing to get the Florida legislature\nto pass a statute.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: That's -- that's correct,\nwith regard to that particular aspect because it was\none needle being used and all the drugs were being used\nin that needle. But that is, again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I would have\nthought your -- your answer to the line of questioning\nearlier was that the reason that the Petitioner has to\ncome up with this -- an alternative is that otherwise\nit's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's\nbringing the action is as a challenge to the execution\nitself rather than the particular method. And that if\nit's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be\nbrought under habeas. If it's just a challenge to the\nmethod, it can be brought under 1983. If he's\nunwilling to say there is a valid method, then it\nstarts to look like a challenge to the execution that\nhas to be brought under habeas.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: And -- and that is the core\nposition the State has taken, and I'm sorry if I did\nnot articulate that in a fashion that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in respect to that core\nposition, I can understand the State's concern with the\npossibility of abuse. But in Nelson, what the Court\nsays is it points to Gomez, and Gomez was a 1983 case.\nAnd there, the Court denied a stay of the execution\nbecause it looked into the history of the litigation,\nand they said that this particular individual had done\njust what worries you, though in a somewhat different\ncontext. He kept bringing the cases, and every time,\nyou know, he'd lose. Then he'd think of another way of\nmaking the same point, and in your context, it would be\nfirst he challenges this method and he says there are\nothers that are fine. So we go to another. Then he\nchallenges that. Then he challenges that. Then he\nchallenges that, always at the very last minute. So\nthere's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that\nyou worry about occurs.\nSo why do we need something else like an\nabsolute rule of some sort that the Petitioner has to\nthink of a method of execution, a matter on which he is\nnot necessarily expert, that would turn out in the\nfuture to be not painful? I mean, you don't need to\nput on your overcoat and also turn up the heat.\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You've got the case that\nhelps you if that occurs. Why do you need to argue for\nsomething else?\nMS. SNURKOWSKI: Well, and the only reason we're\narguing for something else, it seems to me that the\nbasis upon which we are here today is to determine\nwhether 1983 or habeas will lie. And apart from that,\nI'm trying to make an argument, to the extent I have or\nnot, that -- that this is more in keeping with habeas\nas opposed to 1983 litigation.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shanmugam, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWhere a prisoner challenges a particular\nmethod of execution but fails to identify a permissible\nalternative, that claim is functionally equivalent to a\nclaim challenging the prisoner's death sentence per se\nand therefore must be brought --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why is that?\nThat -- that -- in which case it would be like -- like\nHeck. Right? It would come within the Heck\nprinciples.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, our view is that the\nHeck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner\nis seeking relief that is indisputably available in\nhabeas. Our view is that the governing precedent and\nreally the touchstone here is this Court's decision in\nPreiser v. Rodriguez, which drew the distinction that\nthe Court has long recognized between claims\nchallenging the conditions of a prisoner's confinement\nand claims challenging the fact or duration of that\nconfinement.\nNow, to be sure, that analogy is not exactly\napt in the capital context. But we believe that where\na prisoner identifies a permissible alternative, it is\nthat which renders the claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, why? But I\nmean, suppose he doesn't. Okay? But it's absolutely\nclear he's not saying all methods are unconstitutional.\nHe's saying this method is unconstitutional. If he\nsays this method of constitutional and he wins, then\nhis challenge will not necessarily prevent the State\nfrom carrying out its execution. And, of course, I'm\nreading to you directly from Nelson v. Campbell. That\nwould seem right in point. And why isn't that the end\nof this case?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we do believe that\nwhere a prisoner brings an open-ended claim of the type\nat issue here, it would necessarily prevent the State\nfrom carrying out the execution in one relevant sense.\nNamely, it would prevent the State from carrying out\nthe execution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and if I bring a claim\nthat my prison cell is so cold, I actually get\npneumonia and die, or near it, and then I challenge the\ncoldness of the cell, I'm preventing my confinement in\none particular way.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's exactly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a cold cell. And so\nthat would similarly, on your theory, be habeas, but we\nknow it isn't.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, I don't think that\nthat's true, and I do think that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My cold cell is habeas?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: No. I think that the cold\ncell case clearly is a conditions of confinement claim.\nAnd let me explain to you, Justice Breyer, if\nI may, the reason that the identification of an\nalternative is so critical. It is the identification\nof an alternative that renders the claim the functional\nequivalent of a conditions of confinement claim because\na conditions of confinement claim is really necessarily\npredicated on the assumption that the prisoner will\ncontinue to serve exactly the same sentence, even if\nthe claim is successful. In your hypothetical, if a\nprisoner claims that his cell is too cold, the\nnecessary implication is that the prisoner will be able\nto continue to be imprisoned at some higher\ntemperature, even if the prisoner does not specify in\nhis complaint that he wants to be held at 70 degrees or\n72 degrees. And that is the reason why the\nidentification of the alternative is so important.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why more than in Nelson?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in Nelson, it was\nimportant, and we would submit that it was really the\ndispositive factor in the Court's analysis. The Court\nnoted the fact that the State had conceded -- the\nprisoner had identified and the State had conceded that\nan alternative method could be used to administer the\nexecution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't -- I didn't get\nyour explanation. Had you finished it?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Let me try -- let me -- let\nme try again through a different route, though.\nWhere a prisoner fails to identify an\nalternative, the risk here is that such a claim could\ndelay and may, in fact, prevent the ultimate execution\nof the death sentence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the risks that\nthe prisoner will die an excruciating death? I'm\nasking you the same question that I asked co-counsel.\nWhat happens then? He hasn't been able to come up with\nan alternative, but the judge finds it credible that he\nmay be exposed to an excruciating death. What then?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in that case, he may\nvery well have a valid Eighth Amendment claim. But our\nprincipal submission --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But would --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- is that he cannot proceed\nin a section 1983 action. Presumably what would happen\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Because he's\nsaying I am not asking for this to be one day further\nalong. I'm just asking the State to give me a death\nthat will not require me to suffer excruciating pain.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, the concern with\nthe claim that fails to identify a permissible\nalternative is the risk of seriatim litigation. And I\nthink that the history not only of the Nelson case, but\nalso of some of the ongoing litigation, most notably\nthe Morales case in California, demonstrates that that\nrisk is a very real one. Where a prisoner fails to\nidentify an alternative method, it is not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Except -- let me just\ninterrupt. Supposing he did identify, say you can only\nuse pentobarbital on me, the same way they do it for a\nveterinarian. And the -- and the judge says, well, I\ndon't think that's required. But he would then be\nsatisfied the 1983 requirement?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the State would at\nleast have the option in that case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of saying no.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- of acquiescing in the\nalternative. The State would, of course, have the\noption of saying no and litigating it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you agree if he had\nsaid I propose alternative X, even though it's highly\nunlikely the State will accept it, that would make it a\n1983 action?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That would make it a 1983\naction. And the critical point, as this Court\nrecognized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though there's no\nfunctional difference in terms of future litigation\nbetween that case and this.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the only reason that\nthere would be no functional difference is if the State\nchose to, in fact, litigate the issue, notwithstanding\nhis identification of the permissible alternative.\nAnd in Nelson --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying -- saying\nthen that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar,\nand the prisoners are the group of people that have to\ngo and do the research on humane methods of putting\npeople to death rather than the government.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That strikes me as a little\nodd, doesn't it?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- I would -- I would\nrespectfully submit, Justice Breyer, that that is\nexactly the kind of research that they would have to do\nin order to bring the claim in the first place.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think -- I\ndon't think that's the research they would do. I think\nthe research they would do would be to come up with\nanother method that the State certainly would not find\nacceptable, thereupon, rendering it a 1983 action and\n-- and leaving everything in the same status that it's\n-- that it is here. I mean, I don't see that you've\naccomplished anything by simply demanding that they --\nthat they come up with an alternative. They're going\nto come up with a -- with an unacceptable alternative.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the alternative at a\nminimum has to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it might be\nmalpractice not to come up with -- with an unacceptable\nalternative.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHANMUGAM: At a minimum, the alternative\nhas to be one that is permissible under currently\ngoverning law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Old age. They'll come with\nthat alternative, old age. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that would not --\npresumably that would not be a method of execution at\nall.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this is a death\ncase. It was not that amusing.\nLet me ask you this. Doesn't the State have\nsome minimal obligation under the Eighth Amendment to\ndo the necessary research to assure that this is the\nmost humane method possible? Doesn't the State have a\nminimal obligation on its own to do that?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I'm not sure whether it -- it\nwould have an obligation to use the most humane method\nunder the Eighth Amendment because this Court's cases\nhave only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of\npain is barred by the Eighth Amendment. I'm not aware\nof any cases --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I can define\ngratuitous -- I don't have the dictionary here. But\ngratuitous means essentially unnecessary. If there\nwere other -- other means, other alternatives, that\nmight be used, it seems to me that the State might have\nsome minimal obligation to investigate those.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think more broadly,\nJustice Kennedy, that one reason that States do have\ndiscretion in this area -- and I think that Florida is\nnot unusual in that regard -- is that prison officials\nare expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution\nand to take into account changes that might suggest\nthat a particular method is problematic. And so\nwhether or not there is a constitutional obligation, I\nthink that there is every reason to think that States\nwill, in fact, do that.\nI think that it is noteworthy --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But is there -- is there in\nthis case? I mean, the Lancet article has been out\nthere for a while, and it certainly is enough to\nsuggest, in your words, that there is something\nproblematic about the manner in which Florida proposes\nto do this. And yet, we have not heard a word that\nFlorida has made any effort whatsoever to find an\nalternative or, for that matter, to -- to disprove what\nthe Lancet article suggests.\nAnd so it's one thing for you to say the\nStates have discretion. I don't think that answers\nJustice Kennedy's question as to why the State does not\nhave an obligation to fulfill its constitutional duty\nto execute without gratuitous pain. And I don't see\nwhy you have given any answer to -- to the proposal\nthat that obligation requires the State to do some\ninvestigation of it's own.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, whether or not the\nState has that obligation -- it may very well have that\nobligation as a constitutional matter, but putting that\nto one side, it does seem as if the critical question\nis whether or not the State, in fact, has adopted a\nmethod that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and\nwhere a prisoner has a claim of that variety, a\nprisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling\nto identify a permissible alternative to bring that\nclaim besides --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've -- we've never held\nthat anyway, have we?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And the Court has never held\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That the State must, in --\nin imposing the death penalty, use a method that\ninflicts the least amount of pain.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The Court has not held that.\nInstead, it has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably\nthere's some range between most humane and what's cruel\nand unusual. Right?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is\npresumably true, based on the formulations that this\nCourt has used which have repeatedly focused on the\ngratuitous or wanton infliction of pain as opposed to\nthe least painful method.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shanmugam,\nseveral of the emergency death proceedings we've had\ninvolving this question, the district court judges have\nassumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then\ndenied relief because it was brought on the eve of\nexecution, as this one was. Is that option available\nto the district court in this case if it's sent back?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It is available to the\ndistrict court, and indeed, it would potentially be\navailable even to this Court as a matter of first\ninstance as it was in the Gomez case.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Doss, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF D. TODD DOSS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You know it -- it is true\nthat the 1983 is a civil action, and the plaintiff has\nthe burden of proof, burden of producing evidence.\nMR. DOSS: That is true. That is true, and\nwe would be prepared to do that if we were allowed to\ngo back and -- and proceed. We have produced evidence\nat the -- at the pleadings stage, and as we sit here\ntoday, since there hasn't been an answered filed, our\n-- our pleadings are -- are accepted as -- as true for\n-- as a matter of procedure.\nThe interesting thing is, is that -- is that\nFlorida created this problem. They can -- they can lay\nit out as to how to euthanize dogs and cats, but they\ncan't do it for humans. That's perfectly in the open.\nYet, they shroud this in secrecy. We can't get public\nrecords. We can't -- 3.852(h)(3) of the Florida Code of\nCriminal Procedure prevents us from going and getting\nthese records before --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there\nwas adequate time for the district court to fully\nconsider the evidence you intended to present and\nconsider your claim and still proceed with the\nexecution that was scheduled?\nMR. DOSS: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You filed your case 4\ndays before the execution.\nMR. DOSS: No, but we were put in that\nposture by -- by the way the State of Florida has\nchosen to -- to vest this total discretion, shroud\neverything in secrecy, and then complain that we didn't\nbring it earlier when we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Sims protocol was\nthere as a matter of public domain. You said in your\ncomplaint yourself, when you didn't get any\ninformation, you said, well, I assume they're going to\nfollow Sims. Why wasn't that assumption valid 3 months\nbefore, 6 months before, or a year before?\nMR. DOSS: Because at that point, I knew that\nthey had total discretion. I knew that before they had\nchanged their protocols when the electric chair\nlitigation was going on. Indeed, the Florida\nlegislature changed the entire statute when this Court\naccepted Mr. Bryant's case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nyou might -- you might have alleged that -- that you've\nread articles, Lancet articles, and so forth, and that\nthere is a substantial risk that they're going to do\nthis. I think that might suffice.\nMR. DOSS: That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it would -- it\nwould mean that the -- as the Chief Justice indicates,\nthe court has more time to look at this.\nMR. DOSS: As far as -- as far as the -- the\nripeness issue, it's not -- because of the way Florida\nchose to do their procedure, it was not ripe, and it\ndoesn't comport with this Court's basic ripeness\ndoctrine that we are going to presume it's going to be\ndone a certain way when the State can come in and say,\nit's not ripe for review, we -- we still have the\nability to change this rather than us coming --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you -- suppose you\nnever were told by Florida what the -- how exactly it\nwas going to be done. Does that mean you never could\nhave brought a 1983 claim even on the day -- the\nscheduled day of execution?\nMR. DOSS: If they -- if they never told us,\nI guess we would be in -- in a position of -- of\nassuming Sims is in place. But the thing is, is that\nit's an equitable -- it's an equitable argument. And\nFlorida is not coming forward with clean hands. They\ncreated this and then they just want to say, well, you\nshould have known. We're not going to do anything to\nhelp you. We're going to shroud this in secrecy and\nnot tell anybody.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose they did\nset it forth but reserved the right to change it. They\npromulgated a regulation without public notice, without\nhearings or anything. This is our regulation. This is\nhow we intend to conduct executions in the future.\nPeriod. We reserve the right to change this. Would\nyou claim that -- that this was not ripe? You couldn't\nchallenge it at that point --\nMR. DOSS: At that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because they could change\nit?\nMR. DOSS: If Your Honor -- if Your Honor's\nfact situation includes a presumption that that's going\nto be the presumed method, I think at that point, yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. This is the current\nmethod that we intend to use in all future executions.\nPeriod. We may change our mind.\nMR. DOSS: At that point, yes, because they\n-- they are stating that they intend upon using that\nrather --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't -- don't you think you\n-- you --\nMR. DOSS: -- rather than playing hide the\nball.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't you think\neffectively had that knowledge when you knew -- knew\nabout Sims and you knew about all of the cases after\nSims? Is that very much short of -- of their saying\nthis is the -- the procedure we intend to use?\nMR. DOSS: Absolutely not. We only knew\nabout Sims. We asked for records regarding all the\nexecutions since Sims. We have not received it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I understand your --\nyour argument to be -- and I don't think you're making\nit here, but I understood your argument elsewhere to be\nwe knew about Sims, but when they stonewalled us and\nsaid we won't tell you what we're going to use, we had\nreason to question whether they were going to follow\nSims. Isn't -- isn't that your point?\nMR. DOSS: Yes, and that only came into play\nat the point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. You alleged the\nexact opposite in footnote 3. You said when they\nstonewalled you, we assumed they were going to follow\nSims.\nMR. DOSS: They stonewalled us only after the\nwarrant was signed because we couldn't do anything at\n-- at the point before the warrant was signed to be\nable to try to -- to gather evidence as to what it was\ngoing to be. And we were never --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish.\nMR. DOSS: -- we were never told that. And\nbecause the way Florida has created their system, we\nwere prevented from doing that.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
