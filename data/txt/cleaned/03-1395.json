        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in the\ncase of Tenet against John Doe.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case, like the Totten case almost 130 years\nago, is at bottom an effort by alleged spies to obtain\nadditional compensation for services rendered.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, do you take the position\nthat the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision\nof such an agreement either?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's correct. That's correct,\nJustice O'Connor, with respect to the kind of espionage\narrangements and contracts we're talking about.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, suppose -- suppose\nsomebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to -- by the\nGovernment to have breached the agreement by writing and\npublishing a tell-all book about it.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I think\nthat actually points up the important differences between\nthe way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way\nthat it deals with its espionage agents like respondents\nare alleged to be.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect to espionage\nagents --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would the Government be\nwithout any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?\nMR. CLEMENT: I believe that's true, Justice\nO'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign\nprepublication review agreements. They do not receive\nformal security clearances the way that an employee does.\nAnd unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad\nswath of classified information that raises attendant\ncounterintelligence concerns. And so if you think about\nthe course of dealing that the agency has with its\nemployees, the employees are able to sue the agency in\ncourt under, for example, title VII, and the agency can\nturn around and sue their employees to enforce things like\nthe prepublication review agreement that was issue -- at\nissue in this Court's Snepp decision. So in the\nemployment context, I think it's very difficult to say\nthat there's an implied term of the employment contract\nthat either side will not have judicial recourse.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what if the employment\ncontract is with an American citizen to act as an\nespionage agent and nobody else knew about it. Would --\nwould that -- would he be treated as an espionage agent or\nas an employee?\nMR. CLEMENT: If I understand your hypothetical,\nJustice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated\nas an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a\none-off assignment.\nAnd I think that -- that is illustrated by this\nCourt's decision in Totten. I mean, William Lloyd, for\nexample, was a U.S. citizen. He agreed with President\nLincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south.\nAnd this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr.\nLloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there\nwas no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement,\nand the remedy, if any, lay with the President's\ncontingent fund.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I'd like your help on\nthis. Your interpretation of Totten -- does it say that\nthere is just no actionable contract, or does it say\nthere's no jurisdictions like political question? I mean,\nyou win under any of those theories, if we accept them.\nBut which is it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a\ndifficult question to answer because I think there are a\nlot of different strains underlying the Totten decision,\nand I think there is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but you need to get to\nwhether there is -- do you urge dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the\nmerits? It's not clear to me at all.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I think\nit's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that\nit's not really a pure jurisdictional defect. It's been\nreferred alternatively as a jurisdictional bar or as a\nrule of dismissal, and of course, as this Court reminded\nus recently in the Kontrick decision, people tend to use\nterms like jurisdiction loosely in these contexts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not going\naway with a clear idea of your position.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I -- do I -- does the\nGovernment file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction,\n12(b)(6), no cause of action? Of course, you'd probably\ndo both, but I -- I want to know --\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what your best thinking is\nof what Totten means. It seems to me that this just means\nthat there can be no contract formed under these\ncircumstances.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, I think the\ngeneral practice of the Government is to file under both.\nI believe that's what happened here. I think the fact\nthat we file under both suggests that there is a little\nbit of confusion about it. I would tend to agree with you\nit's better understood as a rule of dismissal under\n12(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision,\nthere's really two strains to the decision.\nOne is a recognition that the claim to relief\nnecessarily depends on a fact that the law has always\nregarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't\nproceed. And that's very analogous to this Court's\nholding in Weinberger against Catholic Action.\nThere's a second strain to the case, though, and\nthat is that the very idea of walking into court and\nfiling the action is inconsistent with an implied term of\nthe contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage\nrelationship. And I think particularly if you emphasize\nthat second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's\nbetter understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what\nyou're really saying is somebody is walking into court and\nthey are effectively pleading themselves out of court\nbecause as -- if you look at this complaint here, it\nstarts out with a recitation of the fact that these\nindividuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and\nthat they were denied certain promises that were made to\nthem after they carried out, quote, their end of the\nbargain.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If there's no cause of action,\nthere's nothing to -- to claim on, what's -- what's the\nclosest analogy? Is it like a promise to make a gift,\nwhich is unenforceable? Is there kind of a contract\nanalogy that we can use?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I mean, I -- you know, one --\none way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very\nrough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract.\nIt's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize. And\nI think that -- that reflects the underlying reality of\nthese cases, which is there is something inherent in an\nespionage relationship that when you enter an espionage\nrelationship, you understand that you have no protected\nstatus under the law.\nI think that has, with respect, been clear in\nthe -- not just in the Totten decision but from the very\nbeginning of the republic. I mean, ever since Nathan Hale\nagreed to cross British lines as a spy, it was understood\nthat he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that\nwas not recognized at the law. And I think that is -- it\nhas always been thus, and I think there is no reason to\nrevisit the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does -- does that mean -- the\nno legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an\nagent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't believe that's true,\nJustice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a\nconstitutional claim that an -- an agent -- an alleged\nagent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage\nrelationship. As I would understand your question, I\nmean, it would -- there would be a -- a substantive due\nprocess claim that anybody could bring if the Government\ntortured them. They wouldn't have to allege that I had a\nsecret espionage relationship with the Government and then\nthey tortured me. That would be irrelevant to their\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- could I bring you\nback to your -- your earlier discussion of a spy who is\nalso a -- a Government employee? Are you telling me that\nhe -- he cannot sue for his regular salary simply because\nthe work he was doing was -- was espionage? I mean, he's\n-- he's a GS-whatever, GS-16, and the Government just\ndoesn't send him his monthly check.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He has no recourse for that\ncheck just because he's been doing spy work?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, that's not the position, and\n-- and I -- and I apologize if I gave that impression in\nanswering Justice Stevens' hypothetical. I understood to\nbe the hypothetical that you had a Government employee who\nengaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then\ntried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that --\nfor that particular endeavor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, not -- not for his\nregular GS salary.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. My -- my hypothetical was\nan individual who's not a Government employee but is hired\nby the Government to engage in espionage activities.\nMR. CLEMENT: Exactly. And as I indicated to\nyou earlier, Justice Stevens -- that in a sense that's not\na hypothetical. That's the Totten decision itself.\nWilliam Lloyd was -- or at least alleged that he was\nemployed by President Lincoln to engage in those services.\nAnd in answer to Justice Scalia's question, if William\nLloyd happened to be an employee of the -- of the\nComptroller of Currency or something, he could still sue\nto get whatever remedies he had --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He couldn't get the 5,000 bonus\nfor being a spy. Right?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right. No bonus\ndollars for being a spy under those circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you clarify on the\nemployment question something else? It's -- it's in your\nreply brief and you say you're contrasting this type of\nclaim with a title VII claim which -- in which you say\nthat the Court in Webster relied on the CIA's historical\npractice of litigating employment disputes. The CIA's\nhistorical practice, not the Court's rulings. Are you\nsuggesting that even with respect to employment\nlitigation, it's up to the CIA to decide what its practice\nwill be?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice\nGinsburg, but the point is that the reason that -- that I\nthink that the Government would have had almost no ability\nto invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title\nVII case is because of its course of dealing with its\nemployees. And I suppose that if the agency completely\nchanged its course of dealing with respect to its\nemployees or entered a very different course of dealing\nwith certain select employees, then a Totten defense might\nbecome available in those circumstances.\nBut as I indicated earlier, I think if you look\nat the overall nature of the agency's relationship and\nrights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones,\nthat's a very different relationship than the agency has\nwith respect to espionage agents. And again, that's\nbecause they enter contracts with them. Each side has\ncertain litigation rights, and I think it would be a bit\nof a stretch for the Government to come in and say that\nthere's an implied term of that employment agreement that\nforecloses a judicial remedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess the Government can't\nenforce -- cannot enforce these contracts either. Right?\nI mean, you take the good with the -- the bad with the\ngood?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've never sued a spy to --\nwho hasn't carried out his mission?\nMR. CLEMENT: Certainly not -- I'm not aware of\nsuch a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's\nimpossible. And I think it just reflects the nature of\nthese agreements, and it does -- it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- can we go back to the\n-- another threshold question? You did press below and\nJudge Tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in\nthe district court in California, or wherever, is it has\nto be in the Federal Circuit. This is a contract claim\nagainst the Government. Are you abandoning that position?\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we\nhave abandoned it. We abandoned that position at the cert\nstage. We made that clear to the Court in our certiorari\npapers, and we don't renew any type of jurisdictional\nobjection at this stage.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you free -- are you free\nto abandon it? Is the -- is the Government's surrender of\nits immunity from suit for contracts, provided that the\nsuit is brought in the Federal Circuit -- is that\nsomething that you are free -- Congress having said that,\nthat the executive is free to say, well, we could take\nadvantage of that, but we don't want to?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think the\nanswer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in\nthe pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our\nview that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court\ncould reach that issue and send the case back on the\nTucker Act grounds. So maybe I could explain to you why\nit is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem,\nat least at this stage of the litigation.\nThe Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a\nlittle bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two\nparts to it. First of all, that there might be some kind\nof substantive due process claim here that did not depend\non the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact\nthat there was some endangerment of these individuals and\nthat gave rise to some substantive due process right. And\neven if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is\nnot one that is formed on the contract or an implied\ncontract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's\nclearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because\nit is inherent in the espionage relationship that the\nindividual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where\nthey will be endangered.\nAnd I think that was certainly true of William\nLloyd in the Totten case. When he crossed southern lines,\nhe was very much endangered, and that's something that\nwasn't lost on President Lincoln. In footnote 3 of our\nopening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln\nabout the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the\nneed for secrecy to protect that.\nSo that's why I think that claim is properly\nunderstood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not\nbeing required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but\nnonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine.\nThe other point they made was with respect to\nthe specific regulations that the agency has internally,\nand they suggest that there might be a claim here that was\nbased on the regulations independent of the contract. But\nin order for that claim to go forward, the Court would\nhave to examine the unredacted version of the regulations.\nAnd even if the Court is right that there's a\nneed for further proceedings on that question, it makes no\nsense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the\nGovernment to wait to assert a Totten defense until there\nis a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually\nrequires discovery because I think what Totten recognized\nis -- is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the\noutset before any discovery because of the nature of the\nsuit.\nSo for those two reasons, we thought that the --\nthat the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was\neither not presented because of the substantive due\nprocess claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the\nTotten act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that would make a lot\nof sense if you really felt that what Totten is is -- is a\ndismissal on the merits, just saying there's -- there's no\ncontractual claim. I -- I mean, if you didn't believe\nthat, if -- if you believed that what Totten says is we\nhave no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we\ncould resolve all of the questions.\nBut it seems to me if you believe that Totten is\nbased mainly -- you know, it's a contract case and said\nthe contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be\nreaching the contract issue. We should simply say that if\n-- if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due\nprocess claim here and -- and no claim based on the\nregulations.\nHow do we get the authority to decide the -- the\ncontract question?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think whatever the status\nthe contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or\n12(b)(6), I think it's a -- it's a threshold issue and I\nthink this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach\nthat issue at the outset. And I think it would be\nparticularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that\nwhen we have a suit that we know on the face of the\ncomplaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are\ngoing to not reach that issue in favor of trying to\ndetermine first which court it properly belongs in, when\nthat inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified\ninformation that we know at the outset the suit should not\ninvolve in the first place. And I think there is enough\nflexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the\nCourt to reach that threshold question first.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you're saying that if\nthere's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty\nto protect under the -- under due process procedures.\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I think that follows, Justice\nKennedy. I think one of the difficulties with the\nconstitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is\nit gives -- it seeks a right to enforce internal\nprocedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know\nthere's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at\nall. And it seems odd that this would develop in a way\nwhere the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive\nrights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance\nhere that can be brought forward in the courts.\nI think in this respect it is also important to\nrecognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's\nnegotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the\nbroader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to\nseek assurances not just about compensation but about how\n-- how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how\nthey're going to get their compensation. And I think\nthere's no particular reason to think procedural\nassurances should be judicially enforceable when the\nsubstantive assurances are not.\nNow, one other point to make about the nature of\nthese agreements. Not only because of the nature of these\nagreements does the agency end up in a position where it\ncannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial\nactions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may\nhave to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't\nhave to give and the like. So there are consequences to\nboth sides of dealing in this way with these espionage\nrelationships as effectively outside the law. But again,\nit has always been thus, and I think there is no principle\nin -- in any recent development that requires this Court\nto revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests\nan -- it reflects an understanding that date backs --\ndates back much further.\nIf I can make one other point, which is I think\neven though the Totten decision reflects something more\nthan the state secrets privilege, because there's a more\nfundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an\nespionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to\ncompromise secret information, it is true that applying\nthe Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear\nmechanism that protects confidential information.\nAnd I would analogize it to this Court's\ndecision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive\ntrust arrangement. The Court adopted that arrangement\nwhere -- where an employee who violated a -- a\nprepublication review agreement had to turn over all the\nproceeds to the Government. And -- and the Court adopted\nthat remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court\ndid so to send a clear signal to the employees that there\nis no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these\nagreements. In the same way, having a clear rule of\ndismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that\nthere's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the\nfirst place. It will simply be dismissed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just wanted to ask one. I\ndon't remember whether the briefs discuss it or not, but\nis there a statute that prohibits the disclosure of secret\nagents like this and does that -- if so, does that have\nany relevance to this case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, there is such a\nstatute. There's a statutory provision that gives the\nauthority. It had been with the -- with the Director of\nCentral Intelligence. The recent Intelligence Reform Act\nhas transferred it to the Director of National\nIntelligence. But it gives a requirement that the -- that\n-- that the director protect sources and methods. I think\nthat that -- that statutory provision is consistent with\nthe general notion behind the Totten doctrine, but I don't\nthink it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And does the statute impose a\npenalty on anyone for revealing the name of a secret\nagent?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think it -- it certainly\ndoesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty. There are,\nunder certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the\ndisclosure of classified information, but I think that\nthe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is the identity of an\nagent a -- a type of classified information protected by\nthe statute?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think it is. It's protected\nboth by the sources and method provision, and I think\nrevelation of a source could implicate the -- the criminal\nprohibitions in the statute as well. And I think that\nthis statute -- I think you can see the extent to which\nthis -- this case implicates the core of the secrets that\nthe agency has. This Court in the Sims case described the\nsources and methods protected by the statute as the heart\nof the intelligence community.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement --\nMR. CLEMENT: And this case involves both.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the -- the argument made by\nthe other side, which seems to me has some plausibility to\nit, is that Totten was decided in an age when courts were\nnot as flexible as they are today. We -- we have\nprocedures for matters being kept confidential by courts.\nWe -- we allow hearings that are closed in matters that\nnever would have been done before. And since, the\nargument goes, the -- the only purpose of Totten was to\npreserve the secrets, why can't we preserve the secrets\nthat way? If and when it turns out that the prosecution\nof this -- of this suit would require a secret to be\ndisclosed, we will terminate it or -- but -- but up until\nthen, why -- why decide in advance? Why not take a --\ntake a run at it and see?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, there's a\ncouple of points to be made about that.\nOne, as this Court recognized in Reynolds -- in\nthe Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the\nprovisions of going forward, no matter what innovations\nhave been made, the -- the provisions of going forward and\nhandling classified information necessarily involve risks\nthat the information will be disclosed.\nIn the first place, both Totten and the state\nsecrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that\nthe information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld\nfrom the case. It's an absolute privilege. So the idea\nis not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to\nthe court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the\ncase and that's somehow all consistent with the state\nsecrets privilege. To the contrary. Once a determination\nis made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further\ndisclosure of the information. You -- the whole premise\nof state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate\ndisclosure to the general public. It's that once\nsomething is privileged, you -- you treat the matter as\nprivileged and you take it out of the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not making that\nstatement with respect to anything that's classified.\nThere was something in your brief, reply brief, at 18 and\n19 in which you -- you cite Reynolds and you say the\nproper response to classified information in civil\nlitigation is to disregard the classified information, not\nto order partial disclosure to court personnel. Are --\nare you saying then in all of civil litigation if\ninformation is classified, then it's just out of the case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think there\ncan be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation\nwhere the Government can agree with a party to proceed --\nas part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the\nbasis of classified information, but that would involve a\nvery different way of -- of proceeding than the normal\ndefault rules. And I think absent some kind of agreement\nfor the Government to proceed in that way, the default\nrule in civil litigation has always been that the\nprivilege is just that. It's -- the matter is -- the\nmatter is privileged and it's taken out of the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But you lose. I mean,\nif -- if that matter is necessary for your case,\ndon't -- don't you lose?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely not, Justice Scalia,\nnot in civil litigation. And that's why the state secrets\nprivilege is, I mean, quite a remarkable doctrine in the\ncivil side of the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about civil\nonly.\nMR. CLEMENT: Only civil.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm thinking of gray mail.\nCertainly in the criminal -- criminal area, that isn't the\ncase.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You either cough it up or you\nlose.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right, and a different bargain has\nbeen reached in the criminal context, and in that context\nto ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult\nchoice of revealing classified information or proceeding,\nthe Congress has come through with the Classified\nInformation Procedures Act. That only applies in the\ncriminal side, though.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just want to ask one\nquestion. Don't they have a claim interpreted favorably\nto them that this has nothing to do with a contract,\ntotally nothing? Okay? But there happen to be some rules\nover there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which\nwe've never read, and they say when we use a foreign\nperson as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him\nsomething. We have some procedures. Now, we don't have\nto do that as a matter of contract. We don't have to do\nit at all, but we do it. And so there's a claim here that\nwe want to see that they're following their own rules.\nThey say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is\nabout contracts. Our claim isn't about contracts.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I have two\nresponses to that. The first is I think the -- that the\nTotten doctrine extends more broadly than just the narrow\nconfines of the contract.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it doesn't extend to torts,\ndoes it?\nMR. CLEMENT: I would -- I mean, I would need a\nspecific hypothetical. I can't imagine a tort that by its\nnature --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you go --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- depends on the relationship.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go ahead. You go ahead.\nMR. CLEMENT: I can't imagine a tort that\ndepends on its very nature on the relationship.\nBut we're talking about regulations that, as I\nunderstand the other side's allegations, are regulations\nfor handling secret contracts. So unless one can allege\nthat they were a party to a secret contract or at least a\nsecret relationship, there's no point in that individual\neven being in a position -- they wouldn't even have\nstanding to challenge the regulation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so you're saying if in\nfact, when you look at those allegations, they're about\nregulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a\ncontract, but if there were to be an allegation that it\nhas nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a\nway we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example,\nor someone like that. It has nothing to do with it, you\nsee. Then could they -- what would be the rules then?\nMR. CLEMENT: I still think the answer would be\nthat there would be no relief under that circumstance\nbecause their -- their -- still their claim to having any\nentitlement under those rules at all would -- I mean, you\nknow, total strangers don't have rights under those\nregulations. Alleged spies would have rights under those\nregulations, and the very idea of walking into court and\nasserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent\nwith the entire relationship and the contract that gave\nrise to it.\nI would also point you to the Weinberger\ndecision, Weinberger against Catholic Action, because\nthere this Court applied Totten to not force the Navy to\nproduce an environmental impact statement even though\nthere were regulations on the book -- and the concurring\nJustices focused on those regulations -- where the\nDepartment of Defense said we do produce an environmental\nimpact statement even if it's classified. So I think on\nthe authority of Weinberger as well, the very fact that\nthere are internal regulations on a subject, the entire\nsubject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to\njudicially enforceable rights.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the time for rebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Burman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BURMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BURMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFirst, with respect to the question about the\ndue process rights below, I would note that the Government\ndoes not challenge, and specifically said so in footnote 2\nof the petition for cert and footnote 1 in their brief on\nthe merits, whether there is a due process claim here. I\nwould encourage you -- and I will come back to the due\nprocess question if you're interested.\nI'd encourage you to look at the respondents'\nappendix, pages 72 to 74, where the CIA employee described\nthe fact that there are, in fact, regulations that are not\nlimited to enforcing a secret contract. That is not our\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they are regulations that\nthe -- that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal\nrelationship --\nMR. BURMAN: Actually we don't believe that's\ncorrect, Your Honor. We believe that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you claiming that\nyour -- your people are -- were not spies?\nMR. BURMAN: We allege that they were coerced\ninto that relationship, but we do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, however got there --\nMR. BURMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- they -- they -- your claim\nis that they're spies and that, therefore, whatever your\nprocedural claims may be, whatever your substantive due\nprocess rights may be, as I understand it, depends upon\nthe assumption of a spy-principal relationship.\nMR. BURMAN: We do not agree with that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. BURMAN: We believe that PL-110 allowed the\nadmission of people essential to the United States without\nany comment on whether they had formerly been spies and\nthat these regulations do not require us to prove as an\nessential element even to the CIA, much less to the\ndistrict court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You --\nMR. BURMAN: -- that they were spies for the\nCIA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you don't have to prove that\nthey were spies, but you have to prove that -- that they\nhad a contractual relationship with the United States.\nAnd the only contractual relationship you're asserting is\nthe relationship of a spy.\nMR. BURMAN: We disagree with that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh --\nMR. BURMAN: We do not believe -- and in fact,\nthe Ninth Circuit went out of its way to make very clear\nto the district court that if we try to plead around and\nbase a claim on a contract, the district court should\ndismiss that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait. What -- what is the\nbasis on which you assert these regulations are applicable\nto you --\nMR. BURMAN: We --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to your client?\nMR. BURMAN: -- we say that the -- we believe we\ncan show, once we are allowed to proceed -- and it's\npremature at this time to decide whether we'll be\nsuccessful in this or not. We believe we can show that\nthe CIA has internal regulations that say as to PL-110\nresettlees, we will provide continued financial and\nsecurity support in these circumstances, a need-based\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the agency comes in\nand says, prove that you're a PL-110 resettlee.\nMR. BURMAN: The agency --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and what is your\nresponse to that?\nMR. BURMAN: The agency has never --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your response is I was\nresettled because I was a spy.\nMR. BURMAN: No. We don't have to say that. We\ncan say we were resettled under PL-110, which they have to\ninform at the time the INS Commissioner that they were\nbringing in people as PL-110 resettlees. They're not\nrequired to tell the INS Commissioner that they were\nspies, just that they're essential.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if -- what if the\nGovernment takes a slightly different tack and -- and you\nbring your essentially PL-110 neutral claim, and the\nGovernment says, the only relationship upon which this\nclaim can be based by these particular Does is a spy\nrelationship? We claim privilege, and on the basis of\nthat privilege, we -- we claim dismissal. What is your\nresponse to that?\nMR. BURMAN: If that were an essential element\nof our claim, which we believe it is not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they're not saying it's\nan essential element in the sense that only a spy can make\na 110 claim. They're saying that the only basis upon\nwhich you can make a 110 claim is the spy relationship.\nYou have no other. How do you respond to that?\nMR. BURMAN: Hence the reason we brought the\ncase as Does. A procedure that was not known for that\npurpose at the time of Totten, that their own information\nofficer and their brief and their position in Webster\nadmits preserves the identity, preserves the secret. They\nacknowledge --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, look, you're talking about\nprocedural means. I want to know what your immediate\nresponse to their claim of privilege is. Are you going to\nsay we weren't spies?\nMR. BURMAN: The advantage of the Reynolds\nprocedure is if they had made the claim of privilege, we\nwould know what they were claiming was privileged.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They are making the claim of\nprivilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110\nclaim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your\nclients were spies. Do you respond by saying, yes, we\nwere spies, or do you respond by saying, we weren't spies?\nMR. BURMAN: We respond by saying we have an\nentitlement to a fair process within the agency, a\nconfidential process --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that you have a\nreally obnoxious court --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that wants a substantive\nresponse, do you respond by saying they're right, we're\nspies, or they're wrong, we weren't spies?\nMR. BURMAN: If their position is that they\ncan't confirm or deny to the district court whether we\nwere spies --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They are claiming a privilege\non the grounds that the only basis for your claim can\npossibly be the spy relationship based on facts known to\nthem. In order to defeat that privilege, you've got at\nleast to start by saying, no, we weren't spies and we\ndon't claim to be. Are you going to say that or aren't\nyou?\nMR. BURMAN: We are not going to say we were not\nspies. We are going to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then I don't know why you're\nnot out of court on Totten.\nMR. BURMAN: Because we are not claiming the\nbenefit of a bargain to be a spy. We are not seeking\ncompensation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is a PL --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are -- you are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is a PL-110 settlee?\nMR. BURMAN: A PL-110 resettlee allowed the CIA\nand the FBI to bring in up to 100 people per year that\nwere deemed essential to the U.S. They could have been\nsimply very important scientists who wished to defect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you would say this --\nMR. BURMAN: They could have been any --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are -- are you claiming that\nyour answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume\nfor purposes of this case -- we're not admitting whether\nit's true or not, but we're going to assume we're not\nspies --\nMR. BURMAN: We believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because we win even if we're\nnot spies because we are essential persons?\nMR. BURMAN: If we had made the Totten mistake\nof suing in our own name, we would be out of court, but we\nhave sued as Does and we have said we are satisfied with\nthe CIA concluding internally whether we are entitled to\nPL-110 status.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but my guess is --\nwell, he's pushed you and it sounds like it to me -- that\nthe only basis on which you could say you were an\nessential person is that you're a spy.\nMR. BURMAN: We don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's -- he's not a scientist.\nHe's not a --\nMR. BURMAN: Since they have not contested our\nPL-110 status until a somewhat desperate comment in the\nreply brief, we have never had to face this question\nbecause there has been no question that we are PL-110\nresettlees, and that as long as we do not disclose our\nidentity, which we've been careful not to do, unlike\nTotten, there is no state secret that is -- is at risk.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if the question comes up,\nyou're going to have to disclose the identity. I mean, if\n-- if it is controverted whether indeed you're -- you're a\nspy or not, then what do you do? Do you say, well, we'll\n-- we'll do it in camera? That's right? I mean, you --\nyou think that -- that a United States district court has\nall of these security facilities available as Langley? I\nmean --\nMR. BURMAN: We --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- trust me, it doesn't.\nMR. BURMAN: We do not believe that we have to\nhave -- that we have to disclose anything to the district\ncourt to have standing as Does to seek a fair procedure\nwithin the CIA. At the time of Totten, the idea of having\na Doe being able to sue was not recognized for a plaintiff\nwho wanted to protect his identity. We have that now as\nof the last --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do we have to change Totten?\nBecause, look, what I'm now thinking is, A, if you're\nsuing on a contract, you win because you're a spy, if you\nwin. If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win\nbecause you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on PL-\n110, you win because you're a spy, and if you're suing on\ndue process, you win because you're a spy. So no matter\nwhat, you can't win unless you're a spy.\nNow, they -- they have Totten, and it -- it --\nthat sounds to me as if you're there. And do we have to\noverturn Totten for you to win?\nMR. BURMAN: I do not believe so, but you should\nnot expand Totten in the dramatic way the Government asks.\nAnd it does not counsel for you to expand Totten when they\ncannot define a clear line as to where this\njurisdictional, which they use in the brief but abandon\nhere -- they cannot explain to you why in Webster -- they\nargued on pages 37 to 40 of their brief for exactly the\nsame interpretation of Totten that they are arguing now.\nThey specifically said that it should not be up to the\ncourts to look behind the scene of the privilege in\nReynolds, and yet the Court rejected that position.\nIn Hamdi, they said there cannot be a secret\nproceeding with due process and the courts cannot review\nwhether we've made that available, and the Court rejected\nthat.\nThings have changed since the time of Totten.\nThat does not require overruling Totten, but it certainly\ndoes not counsel expanding Totten in the dramatic way that\nthe executive asserts, a way that basically says to the\nCourt you have absolutely no role in determining whether\nour assertion that the state secret is an essential\nelement here is in fact the case and whether it truly is a\nstate secret.\nWe -- if there's anything we ought to be able to\ndecide it's what our case is about. We may have loosely\nused bargain in the complaint, but the district court and\nthe Ninth Circuit have now made it very clear that we\ncannot have a contract claim, we cannot have a due\nprocess, whether substantive or procedural, based upon a\ncontract, we cannot have a promissory estoppel claim. The\nNinth Circuit has decided all of that against us.\nWhat we still have, though, is a claim to a\nfair, internal agency procedure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Attached to what? I mean,\nyou can -- a fair procedure leading nowhere is not a\nclaim. You have a right to a fair procedure because it's\nattached to some substantive right.\nMR. BURMAN: That's what we haven't yet had the\nopportunity to prove as to what it is in these\nregulations. But if you would look at -- again, at the\nrespondents' appendix 72 to 74, the agency's witness that\nthey voluntarily made available, did not make any\nassertion of privilege, did not make any assertion that\nthis was confidential asked, are there agency regulations\nthat you know of that relate to the resettlement of these\nPL-110 people who are resettlees from foreign countries?\nYes. Are there regulations that deal with the\ndetermination of the level and extent of benefits to be\ngiven resettlees? Yes. And are there agency regulations\nthat deal with grievances by resettlees? Yes.\nWe think no minimal due process allows them to\ntell us the wrong standard and not to give us notice and\nan opportunity to be heard in a confidential proceeding --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You still have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what's your best case for\nthat? What's your best case for that proposition?\nMR. BURMAN: Well, certainly Matthews v.\nEldridge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it sounds to me like\ndue process in -- in the air.\nMR. BURMAN: We don't believe it is, Your Honor.\nWe -- we don't know for sure until we are entitled to\nlitigate the regulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. We know enough at the\nsummary judgment stage for us to -- to decide whether the\ncase can go forward or the dismissal stage.\nMR. BURMAN: Well, there has been no summary\njudgment --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or dismissal stage.\nMR. BURMAN: At -- at the dismissal stage, our\npleadings have to be accepted as true, and we believe that\nthe pleadings sufficiently assert that there are\nregulations there that create a -- a property interest and\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That create a property right?\nMR. BURMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the property right is the\ncontract with the United States. I mean, you can't get\naway from the contract by calling it a property right.\nMR. BURMAN: We do not believe there is a\ncontract and we do not believe we have to rely on it. We\nwere -- the Does were coerced into what they did. They do\nnot seek compensation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is your strongest case?\nI don't think Matthews addresses it. What is your\nstrongest case for the notion that you have a property\ninterest even though you don't have a contract?\nMR. BURMAN: Probably Perry v. Sindermann in the\nsense that there was clear that the contract was over but\nthe Court indicated that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that was the firing of a\nschool teacher. There was --\nMR. BURMAN: It was a nonrenewal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- there was -- there was an\ninterest in having your job, contract property, and\ninterest in getting back salary, contract property. Not\nthis case.\nMR. BURMAN: The -- what the Court actually, I\nbelieve, focused on there and in Goldberg v. Kelly was the\nquestion of whether there were regulations --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Goldberg v. Kelly, welfare\nbenefits, money.\nMR. BURMAN: We believe this is in a sense the\nequivalent of a welfare benefit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Perry v. Sindermann. Is that\n-- that's the nontenured teacher?\nMR. BURMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's no property right\nthere, I don't think. I've always taught that as a ground\nthat it wasn't compared to Roth where there was. All\nright. So -- so -- but there was a First Amendment\ninterest of some kind.\nMR. BURMAN: And I believe the Court indicated\nthat it would be possible if there were practices and\npolicies that had been established that set substantive\nstandards for continuing that there would be a property\nright in a fair procedure for determining that internally\nat the school.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're probably right if they\nhave -- I see what you're saying.\nMR. BURMAN: We also believe there is a liberty\ninterest. These people came to the U.S. in danger. The\nmere fact of labeling them essential to the United States\nand bringing them in in the PL-110 status, taking away\ntheir identity, giving them a false identity, false\nreferences, changing their occupations, all of those\nthings we believe -- we have an argument -- created a\nliberty interest in continuation of the protection. It's\nthe special relationship, the Dushane-type argument that\nthe -- that the Ninth Circuit relied on.\nBut I would hasten to add it is premature to\ndetermine whether we win on the merits, and the Government\nis absolutely wrong in their brief in suggesting that\nunless we can prove at this point that we can win on the\nmerits, that we don't have standing. We have standing to\nmake a claim for fair procedures. Those procedures may\ninclude confirming internally to the CIA our identity and\nthey may include confirming whether we satisfy whatever\nthe need-based standard is that the CIA has identified.\nWe have made every possible effort to comply\nwith the covenant that Totten imposed in a contract, a\ncontract that we don't believe we have. We sued as Does.\nWe have sought preapproval of every single filing. We had\n-- counsel that learned any confidential information were\nprecleared by the agency. That is not what happened in\nTotten. Those are procedures, as Justice Scalia has\nsuggested, that did not -- were not recognized at the time\nof Totten just like the due process claim was not\nrecognized at the time of Totten. And it is a claim that\ncan be done internally to the CIA.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that Totten would be\ndecided differently today because of the -- our due\nprocess jurisprudence?\nMR. BURMAN: We believe that Totten didn't know\nto make a claim other than contract.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- that's not my question.\nMR. BURMAN: Yes, we do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Mr. Totten is here\ntoday.\nMR. BURMAN: And if there were regulations in\nthe Totten situation that created some sort of meaningful\nstandard that would be applied by an internal procedure,\nwhich the record shows here the CIA has an internal\nprocedure, not just regulations setting out the standard,\nbut a review process. We simply want to have a fair,\ninternal procedure.\nThis case really is not about the protection of\nstate secrets, but the limits of the executive authority\nto unilaterally assert without any review by the court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would the court -- a\ncourt go about monitoring this fair procedure --\nMR. BURMAN: We -- we don't believe the court\nwould have a role in monitoring the fair procedure. It\nwould simply determine whether the procedure that the CIA\nhas described in the court record already satisfied\nminimum standards of -- of due process. If the court\nfound that it did not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then you -- you said that\n-- suppose you knew what it was on paper and then you\nwanted to complain to a court, that's not what they gave\nus. They said that in their regulations, but they gave us\nsomething much less.\nMR. BURMAN: It's possible that the CIA would\nassert that there is some reason that it gave less than\nits regulations that would be a state secret. It's hard\nfor us to imagine what that would be, but in fact that is\nopen on remand for the -- for the CIA to argue that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do these regulations just set\nforth a procedure or do they set forth some substantive\nentitlement?\nMR. BURMAN: They seem to do both. They -- we\nhaven't, of course, seen them in full yet, but they set\nforth a procedure and then they also say that there is\nsome sort of need, age, indigency, and health-based\nstandard for continuing the support. And if you'll\nnotice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then it will be worse for them.\nI mean, they say, look, frankly we'd rather reveal the\nnames of one or two spies than we would like to reveal our\nprocedures for dealing with the spies we bring into the\nUnited States. It will take someone who reads those about\n15 minutes with a computer to locate 400 resettled spies.\nThat will be a terrible disaster.\nMR. BURMAN: If that was an external process,\nbut we agree it should be internal to the CIA, that the\nprocess for applying that standard must remain internal to\nthe CIA. The Does share the interest in protecting their\nidentity and the identities of others like them.\nWe -- we believe that the Government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your answer? What is\nyour response?\nMR. BURMAN: That there's no external -- there\n-- there will be no public knowledge of that information,\nthat they can explain their -- they can apply their\nprocess internally, apply the need-based process\ninternally, and that will not be litigated in the courts\nif they assert executive -- or state secret privilege as\nto that, and we assume that they would at that point. But\nwe -- we agree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the court would say you\ndon't have a cause of action unless it knows what -- what\nthese regulations say. Surely the regulations have to be\ndisclosed to the court at least.\nMR. BURMAN: We -- we believe that's the case\nand they have not yet said that it would hinder the state\nsecrets at all to disclose them, and they have disclosed\nquite a bit and said that the remainder they are holding\nback only a need-to-know basis. They have not asserted\nany state secret privilege with the remaining regulations.\nAnd we know, in fact, from the letter that is in\nthe record from -- between the CIA and the Justice\nDepartment in which the -- there was basically an\nunderstanding that there would be regulations like this in\norder to make sure that these PL-110 resettlees did not\neffectively become wards otherwise on -- on the Government\nand that the CIA would continue some responsibility for\nthem.\nThe -- we are not aware of any case in which\nthis Court has suggested that there is an obligation of\nthe district court to look behind the use of Doe and\ndetermine in a public manner the identity of the person.\nThat -- the Government seems to assume that they have some\nentitlement to have a self-inflicted harm that they would\ndemand that the identity of the Does be disclosed publicly\nand that they're entitled to do that. We do not believe\nthat that's a required part of the use of Does.\nAnd in any event, we think it is somewhat\nsimilar to the criminal context where, if the Government\nis going to insist on moving forward in some way that is\nan affirmative defense like that, they may well have a\nresponsibility for not being able to defend their position\nif they, at the same time, say that the state secret\nprivilege applies. But at this point, anyway, that has\nnot been presented to the district court.\nWe -- we find it strange that the Government so\nquickly now says, unlike what it argued in Webster, that\nthere is this type of contract which is not subject to the\njurisdictional bar, and that is a contract with their own\nemployees when they tell us that those same employees are\ngoing to know a much broader swath, as Mr. Clement said,\nof secrets. If their rationale made sense as something\nthat was so compelling that the Court should create a\njurisdictional bar for what the courts would otherwise\nhave the capacity and the competence to do, you would\nthink it would apply in that situation as well.\nBut the fact is they lost Webster, and so they\nhave to try to say that there is something still very\nbroad about Totten but explain away Webster, and they\nsimply cannot convincingly do that. Webster was the same\nargument by them. Reynolds was the same argument by them,\nand they lost.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you what is\nprobably a stupid question? Why isn't the contract barred\nby the statute of frauds?\nMR. BURMAN: Well, we haven't thought about that\nbecause we haven't proceeded on -- on the contract. There\nmay well -- we -- it probably is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. BURMAN: And there -- we -- we -- but we do\nnot proceed on the contract.\nThe Does, in fact, do not underestimate the\nrisks of disclosure of their identities and of their\nrelationship with the CIA. Perhaps they put too much into\nthe complaint describing at some length what they did, but\nthe reason for that, I suggest, is understandable. It was\nsubject to preapproval by the agency. Why not put the\nequities in there even though they're not essential\nelements of your claim and see if the agency approves\nthem? The agency approved them. We should not be thrown\nout of court because we put into the complaint allegations\nwhich the agency admits using the Doe, do not threaten any\nsecrets, and which are not part of the essential elements\nof our claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are all of these what you call\n110 resettlees -- are they all CIA resettlees?\nMR. BURMAN: It does not appear that they are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them State Department\nand --\nMR. BURMAN: At -- at least -- my understanding\nis at least the FBI and perhaps the Commissioner of INS at\nthe time for -- perhaps at the request of other agencies.\nIt appears that all three agencies had the ability to\ncreate this exception to the normal immigration procedure.\nIf the Does can show on remand that the CIA's\nregulations are as they allege and that PL-110 status\ngenerally, which is what the CIA witness McNair basically\nsaid, that many PL-110 resettlees are in continued danger\nbecause of the nature of which we brought them in,\nregardless of what they did before we decided to bring\nthem in, or if they can show that in their particular\nsituation there is a -- a special relationship of danger\ncreated, we believe we would have a substantive due\nprocess argument and a procedural due process argument.\nThat is not today's question.\nThe Government has agreed that for purposes of\ntoday's question, it should be assumed that we can make\nout a due process claim. That claim is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure where the\nGovernment has said that. You talk about footnote 2. All\nit said was that they're not appealing the point that you\nhave to go to the Court of Claims.\nMR. BURMAN: And also in footnote 1 in the -- in\ntheir brief on the merits to this Court. I think it's on\npage 7. My reading of that is that they are not\nchallenging the due process analysis, and it would be\npremature to challenge the due process analysis at this\ntime, which is what the Court said in Webster. We believe\nthat our due process argument is stronger than the due\nprocess argument that was made in Webster, but the Court\nin any event said that's not what is -- what is before us\nat this time. And -- and we believe that that's the same\nsituation now.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just wondering what --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me. Do you agree your\ndue process argument does depend on having either a\nproperty interest or a liberty interest?\nMR. BURMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just wondering what's, you\nknow, some foreign -- I don't know who -- who the Does\nspied on, but let's assume -- you say they're in danger.\nSomebody may be interested in -- in the subject. What\nkind of security provisions do you have in your law office\nthat would -- that would make them immune from the kind of\nintrusion that foreign espionage services --\nMR. BURMAN: In -- in general, we have not been\nallowed to take information outside of the agency. Even\nwhen we're in the clear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the\nagency. Just about the name of your clients. I think\nit's -- there are countries interested in -- in, you know,\nwho was spying on them.\nMR. BURMAN: That was their decision to trust us\nwith that, and ironically under the Government's theory of\nthis case, the Does --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it may lead -- it may\nlead to other agents and -- and one of the problems about\nallowing suits like this is that this information about\nwho the agents are will be brought to a lawyer, kept in\nhis law office, and much more readily accessible to -- to\nforeign powers than -- than it would be at Langley.\nMR. BURMAN: And under the agency's theory of\nthis case, there is nothing that stops the Does from\nmaking their identities public because there is no\nenforceable contract that the agency can enforce. The\nagency wants to keep Snepp. It wants to live with\nWebster, and the only thing it has left is to somehow\ncarve out a rule that applies to these people who have\ndone everything they possibly could, including not telling\nme who they are.\nOur files within our office do not identify them\nin writing, is my understanding, by name. I certainly am\nnot aware of who they are. I know what's alleged in the\ncomplaint and nothing more than that.\nBut certainly the risk of gray mail, the risk of\nthe Does -- people in the Does' position disclosing\nsomething is totally irrelevant to the question of whether\nTotten creates some sort of bar that applies not just to a\ncontract claim but to a claim where there is no contract,\nwhere it is not alleged that it is based upon a contract,\nand where the parties have done everything possible -- the\nDoes, the plaintiffs, have done everything possible to\nhonor the confidences that the Government wants to keep.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Burman.\nMr. Clement, you have about 4 and a half minutes\nif you need them.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, just a few\npoints. And may it please the Court, just a few points in\nrebuttal.\nFirst of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's\nquestion indicated, there was no waiver of any due process\nargument. If you look at those footnotes, the only thing\nthat's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked\nabout earlier.\nSecond of all, I think in thinking about this\nPL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think\nJustice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim\nto the CIA. And as I understand their argument, it\ndepends on their being a significant difference between\ncoming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and\nI'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I\nam an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against\nthe CIA, please hear my claim. I would say there's no\nmaterial difference in terms of all of the policies that\nundergird the Totten doctrine between those two. And I\nwould note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a\nand 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents\nwould have to establish a relationship with the agency.\nThe final two points I would make is, first of\nall, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that\nthey are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case. I\nwould make two points about that.\nFirst of all, presumably the reason that William\nLloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it\nwas a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't\nhave a concern about retaliation.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: I would also say that the\ndifference between suing under Doe and suing under your\nname just makes clear that both sides to this litigation\nstart with the premise that the fundamental fact of this\nlitigation turns on a secret. They don't want their name\nrevealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that\njust underscores how this is all about a secret, just as\nin Totten.\nThe last point I would make is they asked you to\ntake their pleadings as a given at this stage in the\nlitigation, and I would ask you to look at those\npleadings. The complaint is replete with references to\nthe espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites\nTotten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times. I\nwould suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred,\nthen no claim is.\nWith that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\n"
