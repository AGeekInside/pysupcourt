        "content": "(11:20 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll next hear Case\n06-531, Sole versus Wyner.\nMs. Seitz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA A. SEITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. SEITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals held that plaintiffs\nwho obtain a preliminary injunction are prevailing\nparties entitled to fees, even though the district court\nconcluded that the State's nudity ban does not violate\nthe Constitution, that plaintiffs were not entitled to\nany permanent relief, and that final judgment should be\nentered against the plaintiffs.\nThis Court's cases have found plaintiffs to\nbe prevailing parties in only two situations, when they\nwin judgment on the merits or enter into a consent\ndecree. And this Court has declined to confer\nprevailing party status based on interim rulings in\nongoing litigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious\nto get your reaction to one of the points made by\nopposing counsel, which is that there were really sort\nof two different pieces of litigation at issue here,\nthat it was an as-applied challenge that produced the\npreliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the\nfinal decision was a facial challenge. Is there\nanything to that?\nMS. SEITZ: No, I don't think there is. In\nthe preliminary injunction, the district court predicted\nthat it would find the nudity ban significantly\ninfringed free expression and that the State had less\nrestrictive alternatives. That's at page 18a and 19a.\nIn the summary judgment decision, the court held that\nthe nudity plan's effect on free impression was de\nminimis and it had, that the State had no less\nrestrictive alternative. So in both instances the\nunderlying legal claim was that as applied to nude\nexpression the nudity ban was unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do we make of what I\nunderstand was the court's post hoc statement that what\nwas -- the reason for issuing the temporary injunction\nwas the perception that there was a content basis at\nwork? And what do we make of it in light of the fact --\nI think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong.\nwhat do we make of that in light of the fact that I\nbelieve it is in the record that I forget the\nappropriate State official said, well, it's true we've\nlet you do this in the past, but this is political or\nthis looks political, which suggests that there was a\ncontent basis going on?\nWhat do we make of the court's statement and\nthe record statement by the official in deciding whether\nthere really was in effect a separate kind of order\ninvolved in the preliminary injunction from the order\nthat was denied at the end of the case?\nMS. SEITZ: There's a factual answer to that\nand a legal answer, and I'll start with the legal\nanswer, which is that the preliminary injunction itself\nstates that it is assuming content --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I know that. I know\nthat.\nMS. SEITZ: And as a legal matter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because that's why I asked,\nwhat do we make of the court's statement subsequently?\nMS. SEITZ: I think we, as the court of\nappeals did, have to disregard those statements because\nunder Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nthe preliminary injunction itself is the operative\ndocument, and the bases that it states for the issuance\nof the preliminary injunction are the bases that must\ngovern both on judicial review of the injunction and as\na matter of notice to the parties of the operative\neffect and basis for the injunction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that so when there is\nsome evidence in the record that a content basis\nactually was the criterion?\nMS. SEITZ: And that's the factual part of\nmy response, which is that this testimony that was\nrelied on which we quote in full in our reply brief, was\ntestimony by the State, a State official who did not\nmake the decision so was not actually aware of why the\ndecision was made, and was testimony only to the effect\nthat the demonstration envisioned on February 14th might\nbe different than her previous plays, because more\npeople might be expected.\nNow the court drew from that telephonic\ntestimony a possibility that the reason for the State's\ndenial on February 14 was the content; but in fact,\nalthough the court didn't recognize it, it also had\nbefore it a decision by the State in 2000 denying her\npermission to put on her play based on its decision to\nenforce its nudity ban against her at that time.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now the 2001 order was it\n-- was it? She applied, I think it was in --\nMS. SEITZ: She wrote a letter in 2000\nrequesting permission to perform her play --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMS. SEITZ: Under the same terms that she\nhad under the stipulated settlement from 1998. The\nState denied her request in a letter indicating that the\nnudity ban would be enforced against the play.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the factual answer in\neffect is there isn't enough fact to support the\ndistinction?\nMS. SEITZ: And -- and I guess there's in\naddition a legal elaboration on that factual record,\nwhich was this was all occurring in a preliminary\ninjunction hearing that took place 24 hours before the\ndemonstration, telephonic testimony of an ill-prepared\nState witness. It was never followed up, even though\nthat claim remained live through summary judgment,\nbecause the plaintiffs continued to have a claim against\nan individual defendant for damages.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. But when you got to\nthe summary judgment stage, the particular peace\ndemonstration performance was -- was behind them. So\nthey're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected\nto be reinjected into the case.\nMS. SEITZ: The challenge continued because\nthere was a claim for individual damages from the park\nmanager. So in order to determine that individual claim\nfor damages, of course, the plaintiffs could have put in\nevidence that, in fact, rather than just as a\npreliminary prediction, the injunction was issued to\nprevent content-based discrimination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it wasn't moot after the\ndemonstration.\nMS. SEITZ: That was not mooted out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's one of the\nthings that concerns me. I mean in many of these cases\nyou have fairly elaborate proceedings over the\npreliminary injunction and the event takes place. I\nwould not want to get to a situation where people feel\nthe need to artificially keep a case alive simply to\nensure their entitlement to attorney's fees. So how do\nyou protect against that?\nMS. SEITZ: We -- the purpose of the\nattorney's fees provision is to encourage and reward\nmeritorious litigation. And at the point at which you\nonly have a preliminary injunction, no matter how long\nthat preliminary injunction has been in effect, what you\nhave is a prediction of success on the merits, a\nbalancing of equitable factors that determine interim\nfairness, but you do not have a decision that the\ndefendant has violated the Constitution or any Federal\nlaw.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in, but in many cases\nthe case will become moot after a period of time and the\nChief Justice and I have the same concern. The question\nis directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for\nthe -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?\nMS. SEITZ: There are significant\nconsequences to a finding of liability. And to\nconferring preliminary -- or fees for preliminary\ninjunction when you do not have a final determination of\nviolation by the State, you're essentially ordering the\nState and local governments who have not been judged\nviolators of law or had a full or fair opportunity to\ndefend as a matter of law --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're asking about\nwhat rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you\nis that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys\nfees in this instance, that will then create pressure to\ncontinue the litigation when it's for all practical\npurposes of no real importance to the parties, other\nthan to just establish attorney's fees. And that seems\na waste of resources.\nMS. SEITZ: And but the -- the situation --\nthat situation will also obtain if you confer attorney's\nfees and prevailing party status on a plaintiff who only\nhas a preliminary injunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do we have to judge\nall preliminary and judgments alike? I mean, in some\ncases, the preliminary injunction is the thing. For\nexample, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had\nsaid yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge\nbut we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration,\nand we got it; so we're -- that's enough. We're not\ngoing to fight on.\nMS. SEITZ: The fact that a plaintiff gets\nhis or her way temporarily based on a preliminary\njunction does not mean that the defendant has violated\nthat plaintiff's constitutional rights or that that\nwould be the resolution of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Who -- who -- where does it\nsay you have to have done that? My statute here says in\nany action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or\nwhatever was such an action. It says the court in its\ndiscretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys'\nfee. Well, did they prevail fail or not? They got what\nthey wanted. And it was such an action. Doesn't say\nanything about whether you have been declared horrible\nor wonderful or violator or not a violator. It says did\nthey get what they want in the action? Answer, yes.\nEnd of matter.\nNow what's wrong with reading it that way?\nMS. SEITZ: To prevail you must prevail on a\nlegal claim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, they got the legal\nclaim. The legal claim is we want to have our\ndemonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it\nand therefore issue an order. You said no, don't issue\nthe order, because they don't. And therefore, they won.\nMS. SEITZ: Respectfully, that's not a legal\nclaim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is not?\nMS. SEITZ: The underlying legal claim is\nthat the State's denial of the permit was\nunconstitutional.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. But what about the\nlegal claim we are under the law entitled to a\npreliminary injunction.\nMS. SEITZ: That is a type of relief you are\nseeking but it's based on an underlying legal claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not a determination,\nis it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?\nMS. SEITZ: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is just a determination\nthat we don't know at this point enough to say that you\ndon't have a right.\nMS. SEITZ: It is a product of an equitable\nbalancing that determines interim fairness --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well I thought, where it\nsay that in the statute that you have to have that\nparticular kind of a claim?\nMS. SEITZ: I think this Court's cases have\ninterpreted the word prevail and prevailing parties to\nmean you must prevail on the merits of a legal claim.\nThe only instance in which that is not true is in a\nconsent decree scenario and in a consent decree what you\nhave is a defendant assuming legal responsibility for\nproviding relief on the merits that resolves a claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what do you do in\na situation of mootness where there's -- you know,\nthey'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that\nthey prevail on a permanent junction as well as a\npreliminary one, but the case has become moot. Are they\nautomatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that\ncase?\nMS. SEITZ: A claim that is never resolved\ncannot be the basis of prevailing party status. And\nthat's what your hypothetical poses. And I also think\nit's not correct to say there is no point in continuing\nwith litigation in that setting. In a private attorney\ngeneral setting, there is a value to having at the end\nof litigation a decision --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may be a\npint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the\nlocality governments -- I mean if you ask them the\nquestion, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees\nwhere you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the\ncase becomes moot, or would you rather have to face\nindividual officer liability to prevent the case from\nbecoming moot? Or would you rather face ongoing\nlitigation to prevent the case from becoming moot\nbecause there's too much invested in the fees -- they\nmight choose the former.\nMS. SEITZ: Well in this case, of course,\nthe State officials decided to defend the\nconstitutionality of their nudity ban to the end. It\nwas important to them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the plaintiffs\ndecided to challenge it to the end. But I'm suggesting\nthat if they know they might -- it might result in a\nloss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was\na particular demonstration, others might pursue it\ndifferently.\nMS. SEITZ: There are significant\ncountervailing considerations, and one is that under the\nrule you're proposing, state and local governments would\nbe fearful about enforcing perfectly valid laws in\nemergency situations for fear of being penalized with\nfees. Then they have no fair chance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you are saying the\nChief Justice is proposing a rule. I think he was\nasking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing.\nAnd we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic\ngood sense to insist that every preliminary injunction\nbe carried through to a final adjudication for\nattorney's fees. And we are asking is there some midway\nground. And you, you've so far -- you can structure the\nargument the way you want, but you so far are -- in\neffect telling me absolutely not.\nMS. SEITZ: I -- I think that because of the\nrule I distill from this Court's case which is that you\ncan't prevail on a claim that's not decided, it's hard\nfor me to see what the middle ground would be. We do of\ncourse have the alternative ground for decision in this\ncase which is that a claim, a preliminary junction\nthat's issued in ongoing litigation whose prediction on\nthe merits is later essentially proven to be false by\nsubsequent litigation, can't be the basis for prevailing\nparty --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what do you think, when\nthis was enacted, to make up an example that it is as\nhorrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was\nriding in the South, and a group of civil rights\ndemonstrators wanted to make certain they could have\ntheir demonstration outside the jail and they go to the\njudge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the\nwhole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow.\nTomorrow. Right now. So -- and we don't really care\nthat much about the end of it, but we'll -- we'll go\nahead and litigate it if you want. Now they get their\ninjunction. They have the demonstration; it's over. I\nwould have thought if there was a situation for which\n1983 was written, it's that one.\nMS. SEITZ: And if in fact it is clear that\nthere is no issue law in that setting.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, there is. The other\nside has a lot of arguments. And they each have\narguments. There are plenty of issues of law.\nMS. SEITZ: Then you just articulated why\nthat plaintiff should not be considered a prevailing\nparty without taking the position that that is capable\nof repetition, but evading review situation, arguing\nthat in effect the judgment is based totally on law and\nconverting it essentially to a judgment on the merits,\nor otherwise coming to a final judgment on a claim, so\nthat the plaintiff would have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should a\nplaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we\ngot precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be --\nthis is a one-time only demonstration. We're not going\nto repeat this.\nWhy force litigation, especially when we can\nsay in this case, you lost on the merits? The judge\nmade a prediction. Turned out that -- that that was\nwrong.\nMS. SEITZ: To -- to impose attorney's fees\non a defendant, it's not simply about what the plaintiff\ngets, whether the plaintiff gets what he wants, but it\nis also about what the justification is for forcing the\nstate and local government to pay fees.\nAnd the purpose of the Civil Rights Act is\nto impose such fees against violators of civil rights\nand for the benefit of victims of similar rights\nviolation, and not simply on those whom it is predicted\nwill have a substantial likelihood of success on the\nmerits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you get a case that\ninvolves a student. And -- and something like the\nDeFunis case. The student is admitted to the law school\nevent. They have much controversy over this affirmative\naction program. The student graduates. And -- but the\nstudent has prevailed up until that time.\nMS. SEITZ: I don't believe the student has\nprevailed within the meaning of Section 19(a). The\nstudent has been predicted to be likely to prevail and\nhas received an interim fairness -- an interim\nadjustment based on considerations of fairness.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But can't fight on\nbecause first, the student had gotten everything that he\nwanted and the case is moot. The student has graduated.\nMS. SEITZ: In that situation, I think the\nbenefit is capable of repetition for debating review or\nof utilizing the class action --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On if you had a class\naction. He had a single action, and he's graduated.\nMS. SEITZ: But there are tools a plaintiff\ncan use to prevent this kind of case from becoming moot\nwhere there is an important need to have an issue\ndecided.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Apart from the class\naction, what -- what else is there?\nMS. SEITZ: 65(a)(3) which allows\nconsolidation of a merits determination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh. Yeah.\nMS. SEITZ: I reserve the reminder of my\ntime?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, what if --\nwhat if there's nothing else he can do? What -- what\nhorrible does he face? He faces a horrible of having to\npay for his own litigation, just like the rest of us do.\nI mean this is an extraordinary benefit\nwe're talking about here, getting -- getting your\nattorney's fees paid. I -- it doesn't seem to me that\nwe're casting this, this person into the underworld.\nMS. SEITZ: And there's no basis for\nawarding fees against the innocent state and local\ngovernment not determined to have committed a violation.\nMay I reserve the balance?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nWe'll hear from Ms. Millett. Ms. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThis Court has held repeatedly that\nliability for attorney's fees and liability for\nviolation of Federal law go hand in hand. A preliminary\ninjunction does not determine that there has been a\nviolation of Federal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you on the all\nor nothing team this morning?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- can a\npreliminary injunction never be the basis for an award\nof attorney's fees?\nMS. MILLETT: I won't say never in this\nnarrow circumstance. And that is when, when a\npreliminary injunction results in a definitive and\ndeterminative ruling of law such as Thornburgh versus\nObstetricians -- College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists, or the steel mill seizure case from this\nCourt. It came up on a preliminary injunction but this\nCourt made a dispositive and controlling ruling of\nconstitutional law. And assuming that that declaration\nis then followed up by a change in behavior by the\ndefendant compelled as result of the ruling, that would\nbe enough. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How can that\nbe, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive\nquestion of law? Does that happen?\nMS. MILLETT: Well it happened -- it\nhappened in this Court and -- and -- and there were\ndissenters. But there -- it happened in this Court's\ncase in the Thornburgh case. It came up on a\npreliminary junction. This Court determined there were\nno disputed questions of fact and it was only a contest\nof law what the Court said is that when they have done\nthat we can make dispositive ruling of law. But I think\nthat's an unusual situation and what's critical is that\nwhen --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it wasn't the issuance\nof the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was\nthe appeal to this Court where we -- we resolved a\nquestion of law.\nMS. MILLETT: This Court resolved a question\nof law on the merits. The debate in that opinion\nbetween the majority and the dissents was that the --\nthe dissent said majority should only decide whether it\nwas an abuse of discretion to issue the preliminary\ninjunction.\nAnd, I mean -- it, it, it can become sort of\nthe same thing if an error in law is necessarily an\nabuse of discretion, but when -- when a superior court's\nmade a definitive --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the law in respect\nto this, which is right on the point you're arguing,\nthat two parties have this kind of suit and the\ngovernment party -- they settle it, and giving\neverything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at\nthe end they say: We don't admit we violated the law.\nCan you get attorney's fees there or not.\nMS. MILLE TT: If it's a consent decree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a consent decree, but\nno admission of a violation of law.\nMS. MILLE TT: No, that's right. This\nCourt, while repeatedly stating, including unanimously\njust two years ago, that the central justification for\nattorney's fees is that the defendant is a violator of\nFederal law, has found that it will also permit\nattorney's fees in the consent decree situation, but\nthat's because there you have a defendant who is not\nfighting and continuing to resist any form of final\nrelief, has instead agreed to provide final relief that\nruns to a plaintiff, in favor of a plaintiff, and that\nadvances the purpose of Federal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have never\nunderstood why that's an issue. Can't the parties -- it\nseems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the\ntheory. Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's\nfees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree\nand then it wouldn't have to be an issue?\nMS. MILLETT: I think, I think that in\nreality certainly a party can say, I'm not entering into\na consent decree if we're not going to resolve\nattorney's fees now or if we're going to have a fight\nover them. So they certainly have that power because\nit's largely a contract, although one enforced by\ncourts. I'm only trying to be candid with this Court's\nprecedent, which is also recognized in Mayer versus\nGagne. For some reason, maybe they reserved the\nquestion there to be disputed in court whether you'd be\nresponsible for attorney's fees.\nBut I do think That's much more of a side\nshow because that can all be dealt with through the\ncontract elements of the consent agree. And really what\nyou're talking about when a court is coercively imposing\nattorney's fees on a defendant is that the defendant has\na right to not pay those unless they have been found to\nbe a violator of Federal law or have agreed to through\ncontract to deal with that issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but the argument is\nundercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule.\nDon't we have the settlement rule simply because we want\nto promote settlements? We don't want litigation to go\non and on and on simply because somebody wants to\nestablish a right to attorney's fees. And doesn't that\nsame reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary\ninjunction and that's all the person wants. By the same\nreasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we\naccept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient\ndetermination of rights to justify fees because we don't\nwant it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue\nof substance involved, but is just litigating for the\nsake of establishing a right to fees later?\nMS. MILLETT: I have three answers to that.\nFirst of all, there are two parties here. The defendant\nhas a right not to be assessed attorney's fees, which\nare a form of final relief not interim relief, without a\nfinal decision that they violated on the merits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the only attorney's\nfees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees\nattributable to the preliminary injunction.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right, but they have a\nright not to pay anything if they haven't done anything\nwrong.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They have been found\nsubject to a preliminary injunction. The playing field\nis no longer even.\nMS. MILLETT: They haven't been found to be\n-- there may be a Presumption or a substantial\nlikelihood they're going to lose, but that doesn't\nalways come out. And there's not even always a\nsubstantial likelihood --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The point is you wouldn't\nmind putting that on a resume, that you have been\nsubjected to a preliminary injunction.\nMS. MILLETT: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a black mark on\nyour name, is it?\nMS. MILLETT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't violated any\nFederal law.\nMS. MILLETT: This is a case in point.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it does mean, it does\nmean that somebody with a burden to establish an\nentitlement to the injunction has carried the burden.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, the test is the\nprevailing party, not the substantially likely to\nprevail party. And the other reason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then let's not have it in\nthe settlement case.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, again settlements can be\ndealt with through the settlement, as part of the\nsettlement process. But I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are voluntary, these\nsettlements, aren't they? So you could at least say\nthat the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's\nfees for settling gets what he asked for, right? It's\nvoluntary.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, that's what I tried to\nexplain to Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be, but that's not\nthe way the statute is written.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would this case be\ndifferent if the defendant had consented to the entry of\na preliminary injunction?\nMS. MILLETT: No, I don't think so, and I\ndon't think courts as a matter of judicial economy want\nto tell the government every time we agree not to\noppose, to stay the removal of an alien, that we somehow\nwould get a bill.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if this had been, if\nthey had entered into a consent decree covering just the\none event on the front burner, that would have been?\nMS. MILLETT: A consent decree is a final\nresolution of a claim that legally obligates the\ndefendant, final relief that runs in favor of the\nplaintiff.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if they consented to\nthe entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that\nbe equally binding?\nMS. MILLETT: Because it is not a final\nresolution. Preliminary injunctions are important.\nThey're of value to the parties. But there's a\ntrade-off in getting it. The reason courts can give\nthem is they aren't committed to final relief. They\naren't committed to final obligation, and they can\ndecide when --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they were able to go\nahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the\nlitigation, and they would have been able to do it the\nsame way if they had a consent decree instead of having\nthe other side not fight very vigorously in opposition\nto the preliminary.\nMS. MILLETT: The defendant who'S been fully\nvindicated at the end of the case shouldn't have to\nwrite checks to two attorneys instead of just their own.\nThere's a fundamental fairness element here.\nBut also on the judicial economy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then why isn't the\nattorney -- if there were a consent decree -- I don't\nunderstand the difference.\nMS. MILLETT: Because the defendant's in the\ncontrol of the fairness issue in the consent decree and\nis not in this situation.\nBut the other situation, concern, is concern\nabout judicial economy. And there's arguments in the\namicus briefs on the other side that preliminary\ninjunctions are common. But remember, this is -- the\ncentral justification is that the plaintiff is a private\nattorney general who doesn't just do what they want to\ndo, but either resolves the issue of law or obtains\nenduring changes in defendant's behavior that are of\nutility to the community at large. Contrary to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We have when election\nseason comes many, many requests for injunctions, and\nafter the election is over the case just goes away.\nNobody is interested.\nMS. MILLETT: That is not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your position, all\nof these matters must be contested until final judgment\nbefore attorney's fees are available.\nMS. MILLETT: That is not the United States\nGovernment's experience when it's been involved in a lot\nof voting cases. Lots of them get fought until the end,\nand this Court's decision in Brown versus Choate\nrecognizes these are capable of repetition, yet evading\nreview. Now, if the private plaintiff doesn't want to\ndo the work of a private attorney general, that's their\nchoice. No one says you have to stay. It's just, if\nyou want attorney's fees, you have to accept a\npreliminary injunction for what it is. It's very\nbeneficial, but it is not a resolution on the merits\nthat obligates the defendant to provide a form of final\nrelief, not interim relief, to you.\nAnd this Court itself has expressed\nsignificant concerns about having voting cases being run\nup on preliminary injunctions at the last minute and the\nimpact that can have on voting, and we shouldn't\nencourage that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett, did I\nhear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change\nin the defendant's behavior? Is that your standard?\nMS. MILLETT: Enduring more in -- not in the\ntransient sense of preliminary injunction. Obviously,\nthings change on the outside world. But in the form of\nfinal relief and permanent relief, and that's what this\nCourt's cases have said time and again. Not only must\nthe defendant be a violator of Federal law, but in\nFerrari, in Texas Teachers versus Darwin, in Hanrahan\nand Hewitt, the Court has made clear that it is final, a\nresolution of a dispute, a final judgment, the settling\nof a problem that makes someone a prevailing party. And\n\"prevailing party,\" as this Court explained in\nBuckhannon, is a term of art. As we say on pages 11 to\n12 of our brief, \"That term of art, as defined in the\nrelevant dictionaries at the time, was not just that you\nwon something, but that you won at the end of the suit.\"\nAnd that's a question of basic fundamental\nfairness to plaintiffs. Remember, there's going to be\ncountervailing judicial economy concerns. If you tell\ngovernmental entities that they're going to have to\ntake -- may I finish -- - have to take emergency appeals\nfrom every interlocutory order and revisit stays to\navoid liability for attorney's fees.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Millett.\nNow we'll hear from you, Mr. Galanter.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GALANTER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondents went into Federal court because\nState officials told them their protest would be illegal\nand they left Federal court with a preliminary\ninjunction that prohibited State interference with their\nprotest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. They left\nFederal court having lost on the permanent injunction.\nMR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, 20-some\nmonths later they lost on another component of their\ncase, where they were seeking permanent relief to enjoin\nthe facial applicability of the regulations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their legal, their\nlegal claim was that these regulations were invalid\nunder the First Amendment. And they lost on that legal\nclaim.\nMR. GALANTER: At the end of the case, Your\nHonor, yes. But at the preliminary injunction stage,\none -- their claim for relief was a violation of the\nFirst Amendment and there was evidence at the\npreliminary injunction stage that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they succeeded\nin filing their complaint as well, but they don't get\nattorney's fees for that, because they were successful\nat the filing complaint stage.\nMR. GALANTER: That's true, Your Honor. But\nwhat they obtained on February 13, 2003, was the relief\nthey sought.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if they got a TRO\ninstead of a preliminary injunction?\nMR. GALANTER: We're not suggesting that\nTROs --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know you aren't. Why\nnot?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, there are structural\ndifferences between the two.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are the two? I mean,\nthey prevailed. They have a TRO here, something of\nvalue.\nMR. GALANTER: There was not the adversaries\nthat exists in a preliminary injunction. And I think\nthe distinction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's just prevails. If\nyou think \"prevails\" means you come out of there with\nanything that's worth something that has a contempt\ncitation behind it, I don't see why a TRO wouldn't\nqualify.\nMR. GALANTER: We're not suggesting that as\nthe basic rule. What we are suggesting is that if you\nobtain a preliminary injunction, in part because\nCongress recognized the difference between TROs and\npreliminary injunctions and placed preliminary\ninjunctions and permanent injunctions together as the\nkinds of orders that had --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if you get a\npreliminary injunction and then at the permanent\ninjunction stage the basis for the preliminary\ninjunction is reversed. Let's say the preliminary\ninjunction here was based on the ground that the\ndecision was content-based, a factual decision, and at\nthe permanent injunction stage the court finds that it\nwas not content-based.\nMR. GALANTER: Then we would not be\nprevailing. But I have to point out the district court\nin this case expressed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though you got what\nyou wanted? You got to put on the show.\nI thought that at the end of the line, the\njudge said your First Amendment rights have not been\nviolated, the nudity ordnance can be enforced. If you\nhad come back again, say the next week, and said, we\nwant to do another peace symbol, after the court has\nruled on the permanent junction and you lost, you\ncertainly couldn't prevail when you're coming back with\nanother as-applied, when the court has said this\nordnance is good and doesn't violate the First\nAmendment.\nThat's correct. But if there were an\nintervening fact, if they permitted a performance of\n\"Hair\" and then said, but we'll enforce the nudity\nprohibition against your protest, then we would be able\nto come back.\nThe final judgment in this case does not\npreclude future as-applied challenges, either\ncontent-based or arbitrary, and the district court\nrecognized that when it made very clear that it did not\nreverse or repudiate its preliminary injunction ruling\nsimply because we lost the permanent junction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought this court\nsaid, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to\nput on a demonstration that would be like the plays,\nthat would be hidden from public view because you have a\ncurtain or whatever around it. And then the judge said,\noh no, that's not what they wanted, they didn't want it\nto be hidden from you view, they wanted people to see\ntheir demonstration, so if that's what they want to do,\nthey don't have any First Amendment protection.\nMR. GALANTER: That is what was at the end.\nI would just point out that at the preliminary\ninjunction stage, you have to remember Ms. Weyer had\nbeen permitted to put on her play, not hiding it,\nseveral years before. There was testimony suggesting\nthat one of the differences in the result, the refusal\nto allow the anti-war protest, was because it was an\nanti-war protest. And the district court makes it\nclear, in our brief in opposition appendix at page 4a.\nHe says: \"The court did not revisit or reverse its\nearlier decision regarding the same legal issue.\nBut I think all this just goes to the point\nfor that this case presents some interesting issues, but\nthat the per se rule that the Petitioners press, that\nyou can never get --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's stay with this case\nbecause your interest is in getting fees in this case.\nSuppose you had lost the preliminary injunction and then\nyou won at the end of the line. Certainly you would be\nprevailing throughout, right?\nMR. GALANTER: We would obviously be a\nprevailing party. But under Hens ley --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though you lost on\nthe preliminary injunction?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes. Under Hensley versus\nEckert, this Court has made clear you can win on some\nclaims, lose in others.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you would get\nattorney's fees for the preliminary injunction work,\neven though you lost on that?\nMR. GALANTER: We would get attorney's fees\nfor the reasonable work that ended up leading to the\nsuccess. District courts have for decades now parsed\nthrough these legal records, subject to review by the\ncourt of appeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That parsing, is there\nany doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout,\nthat you would get your fees for your entire\nrepresentation?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, there is doubt, Your\nHonor. The court does look for whether these fees are\nreasonable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not that. But would you\nnot get -- would the judge say you don't get a penny for\nthe effort you made to achieve the preliminary\ninjunction because you lost, you lost it, even though in\nhindsight I could see that that was the wrong decision,\nyou should have had it?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, under\nHensley you look to see whether they're related or\nunrelated claims. This Court has adopted --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're obviously\nrelated. It's the same thing. I need -- I have a short\ntime to answer the preliminary injunction. The judge\nsaid: You haven't shown probability of success on the\nmerits, or denies it. You win. I thought that there\nwasn't any doubt that you could get your fees for the\nsuccessful result from the time you filed the complaint\nuntil the final judgment.\nMR. GALANTER: We would hope a court would\nfind that an as-applied challenge and a facial challenge\nwere sufficiently related that we'd be entitled to fees\nfor both. But what I have to stress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though you lost on the\npreliminary injunction? The fees that you reasonably\nexpended in seeking a preliminary injunction, even\nthough you lost, you'd be able to charge to the other\nside?\nMR. GALANTER: If I had won the final --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no? I think you can\nanswer yes or no.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. GALANTER: But I would like to caution\nthat that would be eligible for fees, but the court\nwould go through it and say how much of this were rated\nto your final win, was it reasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. No. How much of\nit related to the preliminary -- you mean anything that\nrelated only to the preliminary injunction you would be\ndenied?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the work you did\nto show irreparable harm, balance of the equities, not\non the merits, you're saying that's off the table?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, it -- no, Your Honor,\nbecause those very things are also needed at a permanent\ninjunction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you've got five hours\nbilled -- you bill for five hours to write the brief\nthat you submit at the preliminary injunction stage.\nYou could get those fees later if you won at the\npermanent injunction stage, could you not?\nMR. GALANTER: Probably. And we certainly\nwould get the money we did for writing the complaint.\nAnd one of our counts for the complaint here was exactly\nfor the preliminary injunction that we obtained.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your\napproach, just as there are problems from the judicial\neconomy perspective with your friend's approach, but\ndoesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth\nand nail on the preliminary injunction because they're\nrunning the risk if they lose there, they're going to\npay fees even if they prevail later? As opposed to, as\nis often the case, they might say, you know, we consent\nto the entry of the preliminary injunction or we\ndon't -- you know, we're going to save our energy.\nDoesn't it require them to fight every possible stage,\nincluding appeal and so on?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, two things, Your Honor.\nAs I think I made clear to Justice Alito, if the\ndecision is reversed or repudiated by the district\ncourt, there would now -- we would not be prevailing\nparties. We would simply have gotten this benefit. But\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean,\nif the decision on what? On the preliminary injunction?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is repudiated by the\ndistrict -- how is it repudiated? What do you envision?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, in the hypothetical\nwhere the same facts, the same law, and the district\ncourt says I was wrong, that would be the kind of\nrepudiation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In a later case, you mean?\nMR. GALANTER: In the course of the\nproceedings in the same case, Your Honor. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he doesn't\nhave to say he's wrong. What often happens is as it is\nhere, he say's I've got 24 hours, I don't have a brief\nfrom the other side, I kind of make the best guess I\ncan. And then later on after an adversary presentation\nand an evidentiary hearing, he issues a different\nruling. As here, he doesn't have to say I was wrong on\nmy 24-hour off-the-cuff guess. It's just that I'm\nbetter informed. Is that repudiation or not?\nMR. GALANTER: No, Your Honor, it's not.\nAnd here, in fact he said the opposite. He said I\nwasn't wrong, these were based on different legal\ntheories. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- can you -- I\nthought what he said was -- I thought they wanted a\ndemonstration that was going to be secure from public\nview, and instead I understand now that's not -- that\nwasn't what they wanted from the start.\nSo on the premise on which I was operating,\nI was right, that they were going to do it just like the\nplays. But what they really planned to do, and did do,\nI was wrong because those facts were not before me. Had\nthose facts been before me, they would have lost on the\npreliminary injunction.\nMR. GALANTER: I don't believe that that's\nthe fairest reading of the district court's subsequent\norders in this case. What the district court made clear\nwas that his as-applied holding, that the plays and the\nwar protests were being treated differently. Remember\nthat it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but assume the\ndistrict court thought he was right at the preliminary\ninjunction, and ruled otherwise at the permanent\njunction. But what if the court of appeals when it\nreviews the fee application, thinks he was wrong both\ntimes?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, we would\nsuggest that the person in the best position to\nunderstand what the district court was doing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is the district court.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But maybe the court of\nappeals is in the best position to determine whether\nthey made an error of law or not.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes. And obviously they\nreview errors of law, questions of law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if they think he made\nan error of law, what should they do?\nMR. GALANTER: If he had made an error of\nlaw in the preliminary injunction ruling that, on\nde novo review, and reversed, then --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, there's no reverse.\nIt's too late. They've had the demonstration so it's\nall over. But in reviewing the fee application, the\ncourt of appeals concludes that the district judge --\nthe decision represented an incorrect premise of law and\ntherefore, he did make an error. Would that control or\nwould the district judge's view of the validity of his\nown decision control?\nMR. GALANTER: We would suggest the latter,\nYour Honor, in part to avoid the fees on fees litigation\nproblems. I mean, other than the per se rule of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, to avoid\nfees on fees, we do something that's wrong?\nMR. GALANTER: No, Your Honor. It's not\nwrong. It's consistent with the text and the policies\nunderlying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought that it -- am I\nwrong about that? I thought that if, A, he goes in, he\ngets a preliminary injunction, he says the law is da,\nda, da, the judge says you're right, that's what it is,\npreliminary injunction. And now it's continued up on\nappeal, the appellate court says you're wrong about the\nlaw. You got it, you had the event, but you're\nabsolutely wrong, the law did not support you. I\nthought under those circumstances you were not\nprevailing and you couldn't get it. Is that the law or\nnot?\nMR. GALANTER: It is the law, Your Honor.\nWhat I'm suggesting, though, is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the hypothetical\nwas different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment\non the merits; and at that point -- okay -- at that\npoint, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction\nwas valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from\nthe preliminary injunction.\nMR. GALANTER: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Assume you win on the\nmerits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's a direct appeal on\nthe fee issue.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor. What my --\nif I may, I agree with Justice Breyer's hypothetical\nthat if you're appealing the merits and the court of\nappeals says something which shows that the -- the\npreliminary injunction should not have been issued,\nwe're not a prevailing party. I agree with\nJustice Scalia that if you're appealing from the\npreliminary injunction and the court of appeals\nreverses, then you're not the prevailing party. But\nJustice Stevens, what I would suggest to you and to\nJustice Kennedy was, we shouldn't be adjudicating\nwhether the preliminary injunction was correctly entered\nat the fees stage. If there is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for\nthat? Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a\nperson has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally\nunsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they\nappeal that and the court of appeals determines it's\nlegally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it,\nI'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee\nin those circumstances, but maybe there is. What is it?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, I mean, the courts of\nappeals have adopted different standards. I can't point\nto one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case you can\nthink of that under those circumstances let's him have\nthe attorney's fees?\nMR. GALANTER: I can't point to one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I would be surprised.\nMR. GALANTER: But the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The other thing that I\nwonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party?\nAnd the reason I ask that is because when I look through\nthe record it seems to me your clients are very\ninteresting. They have their point of view. And their\npoint of view, one of their points of view was that the\nstate said you can have this demonstration, just wear a\nskimpy swimming suit. No. Well, you can have the\ndemonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're\ngoing to put up a cloth so other people who don't want\nto see you don't have to see you. And there your client\nsaid, we won't pay any attention to the cloth. At least\nwe didn't in the past. And then looking at that I\nthought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a\npreliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to\ncall it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up\nthe cloth. It was pretty clear the State would, and it\nshould have been pretty clear that they were going to\nignore it, which they did.\nAnd why is this any different than having\nwon an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but\nin your swimming suit? In other words, they didn't want\nthis. They didn't want what they got. Now, what's the\nresponse to that?\nMR. GALANTER: They did get what they\nwanted. They wanted to be nude. They wanted to make\nsure they weren't escorted off the beach or arrested.\nAnd that's exactly what happened. They had an order\nthat protected that.\nNow, the screen was there, and there's\nmaterial disputes of fact about what they were told\nabout the screen by whom. But the court's order did not\nsay stay behind the screen. They were not in violation\nof the court order.\nBut I think this goes to the more general\npoint, how can you tell when someone prevails, and this\nCourt has already established that. You obtain some\nrelief through a court award that materially changes the\nrelationship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did the court order\nprovide for a screen?\nMR. GALANTER: The court order that -- no.\nThe court order said that the State was not prohibited\nfrom using the means it had in the past. So it\nclarified what the State was not prohibited from doing.\nIt did not impose any requirement on the plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That included a screen.\nMR. GALANTER: It did, Your Honor, but it\ndidn't order the screen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your people didn't want\na screen.\nMR. GALANTER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they didn't get what\nthey asked for.\nMR. GALANTER: They didn't get removed from\nthe beach or arrested for being nude either, Your Honor,\nso they did get what they wanted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only because,\nI guess the other side didn't take the action that they\ncould have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply\nthe screen.\nMR. GALANTER: Your Honor, when you obtain\nthe court award, just as if you obtain a court award to\nget on a ballot or to hold a parade, or to wear a tee\nshirt, I mean, you get that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did they conduct the\ndemonstration with a screen or without a screen?\nMR. GALANTER: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did they conduct the\ndemonstration with or without a screen?\nMR. GALANTER: They did not use the screen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And since they didn't use\nthe screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting\nthem; is that correct?\nMR. GALANTER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they did not get what\nthey asked for. Mainly a prohibition against the state\ninterfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted,\nwhich was one without a screen. You say they didn't get\nthat.\nMR. GALANTER: They didn't get that, but\nthey got something more than they had when they went in,\nwhich was, they got the right to be naked on the beach,\nwhich would have otherwise subjected them to arrest.\nAnd, I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The state had no problem\nwith that. In the past the State had let them do that,\nas long as they had the screen.\nMR. GALANTER: It wouldn't let them do that\nthis time even with the screen. It sent them a letter\nsaying you may not appear on the beach nude. And I\nmean, obviously, at some times you don't get --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the State\nprevailed to some extent as well. They prevailed to the\nextent of getting in the order that they can do what\nthey had done, which is erect a screen.\nMR. GALANTER: They -- yes. They\nnarrowed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they're entitled\nto some -- I mean, if -- this is not a reciprocal\nswitching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question\nof whether or not you are the prevailing party when your\nopponents have prevailed to a significant extent as\nwell.\nMR. GALANTER: With respect, even if we had\nsought and obtained a permanent injunction that allowed\nus to protest but not behind the screen, we'd be a\nprevailing party, although the defendants by their\nsuccessful advocacy would have narrowed the scope of the\ninjunction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this. Is\nit correct that an underlying principle of law that\njustified your claim for relief and your actual relief\nwas that there's some First Amendment right to\ndemonstrate in the nude?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor, that was an\nunderlying part of that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what is the support in\nour cases for that proposition, if any?\nMR. GALANTER: Well, I think this Court's\ncases in Barnes, the nude dancing cases suggest that\nexpressive activity combined with nudity is protected by\nthe First Amendment. Judge Calabrese in the Second\nCircuit wrote an extensive opinion in a case called\nTunic versus Zapper, where he surveys this Court's\ncases, and finds that occasionally there may be for\nartistic or political reasons a right to be nude as part\nof more expressive conduct. But I'd like to maybe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was also a --\nthat was the demonstration or the show arrangement under\nthe -- was it the Brooklyn Bridge or the Williamsburg\nBridge?\nMR. GALANTER: It was on the streets of New\nYork, Your Honor, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At 6 a.m.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor. But to take\nthis back just one step, to the notion that we either\nnot need something that's sort of enduring or merits\nbased in order to obtain relief. Maher versus Gagne\nsuggested, a court doesn't need to resolve the merits in\norder for a party to be prevailing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But see, it's so\nextraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay\nfor his attorney. We don't even do that -- we don't\neven do that for guilty people when they -- when the\nother side wins. So they have violated the law. We\nstill don't make them pay the other side's attorney's\nfees. Now you want us to pay your client's attorney's\nfees even though you're not dealing with a guilty party,\nbecause ultimately the court found no, there really,\nthis person didn't violate the law.\nThat is -- you know, that's double\nindemnity. I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary\ndeparture from our usual practice, which is that each\nside pays his own. It's one thing to say well, if\nyou're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil\nrights cases, we'll make you pay the other side. But\nit's another thing to say if you're -- if you're not a\nbad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky\nenough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll\nmake you pay for the other side. It just grates\nthat that -- it ain't fair.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not just a question\nof weaker, but what Congress intended when they wrote a\nstatute authorizing these fees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that Congress\ndoesn't often do things that are grossly unfair. And if\nthere are various interpretations, one of which is not\ngrossly unfair, that's the one we should --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And these trump the\nliteral language very definitely.\nMR. GALANTER: Speaking of the language, we\nhave here when Congress enacted in 1970 -- in 1998 -- in\n1976, just two years before this Court had interpreted\nanother civil rights attorney's fees statute. In that\none, however, Congress had actually required a final\norder before attorney's fees would be awarded.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, before you leave\nthat, I wonder if -- there's one other thing floating\naround in my mind. I might as well bring it up. The\nword is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground\nthat it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things,\nat least you have to really be prevailing, is there a\ngood faith element in that? That is to say, if your\nclients when they went in to get this order and they got\nit, and at that time they had no intention of following\nwhat they had to do. Rather, they had every intention\nof going out and tearing down the curtain. Does that\nenter into the determination of whether they are really\na prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's\nfees, if you're bringing the ethical element into it?\nMR. GALANTER: I think, Your Honor, that --\nwell, first of all, the preliminary injunction itself\nwas an equitable remedy. Unclean hands could have gone\ninto that question, and yes, in determining the amount\nof fees, again, equity can be considered. The good\nfaith of the parties, just as the complete bad faith of\na plaintiff, this Court has held, permits fees to be\nawarded for the defendants.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can't go into\ncourt with the objective of just getting preliminary\nrelief, can you? I mean, you have to have an underlying\nclaim of illegality and, that seeks permanent relief,\nright?\nMR. GALANTER: That's true, Your Honor.\nAlthough you can go into court knowing that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Knowing that --\nMR. GALANTER: -- you're only going to be\ngetting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- preliminary\ninjunction.\nMR. GALANTER: And everyone here -- excuse\nme. And everyone here knew that absent an appeal, this\nwas the final word on the February 14th --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the February\n14th, but your client sought further relief.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes. But it also sought it\nas a discrete claim for relief in the complaint, this\nvery injunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You get costs? The\nphrase is \"attorney's fees as part of costs\". So, do\nyou get costs for up to the preliminary injunction?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor. The\ndistrict court in this case awarded us costs and also\nawarded the other side costs. And that's actually --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would split the\ncosts?\nMR. GALANTER: He found we were both\nprevailing parties in the case. And that's also\nconsistent with this Court's decision in Hensley, which\nsays you look at a case and the unrelated claims; you\ncan find that the plaintiffs are prevailing parties on\nsome, the defendants are prevailing parties on others,\nand order cross awards of attorney's fees.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So this defendant, having\nsucceeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't\nget costs for the whole case; is that what you're\ntelling me?\nMR. GALANTER: They were awarded -- they\nsought and were awarded all their costs for the entire\ncase, or they sought their costs for the entire case.\nIt was reduced by the district court as a matter of\nequity. But they -- not because -- not parsing it out\namong various parties to the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they were entitled to\ncosts for the entire case?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, they were, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And attorney's fees under\nthe statute are to be awarded as part of costs?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you're not entitled\nto costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how\ndo you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute\nputs them together? Because attorney's fees are part of\ncosts.\nMR. GALANTER: That's correct. And there\nare many cases where both parties end up getting awarded\ncosts. Hensley was one that suggested it was possible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this wasn't --\nMR. GALANTER: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This was one that the\nstate got all of its costs from your client?\nMR. GALANTER: Yes. And our client got\ncosts from the state. There were counter awards --\ncross awards of cost, which is not unusual in civil\nlitigation with multiple claims.\nBut more importantly, I think, when we go\nback and we look at the purposes, not only do we have\nthe language here, we also have the recognition, I think\nas I was mentioning to the Chief Justice, that there's\ngoing to be a lot of situations where core 1983 rights,\ncore constitutional rights are at stake where you know\nyou're not going to be able to obtain a permanent\ninjunction. You may even, as my friends on the other\nside say, ask that the two be consolidated.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if that's not the case,\nbut the plaintiff after getting a preliminary injunction\njust voluntarily dismisses the case? Do they still get\ncosts for the preliminary injunction?\nMR. GALANTER: Oh, I think the answer is\nyes. And I think that that's actually something that\nshould be encouraged. In this case, the preliminary\njunction was relatively cheap, as litigation goes. To\nencourage them to continue, particularly since the core\nrelief they sought had become moot. Yes, there was\nadditional relief they sought, or it could, in a\nhypothetical could seek. But absent an appeal, that\npart of the case is over and there's no real need to\ncontinue to litigate it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you were\nasked this question and your answer may have just\nslipped by me. Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why\nwould you not be entitled to fees on that?\nMR. GALANTER: We think that Congress's\ndistinction as far as putting preliminary injunctions\nand permanent injunctions in one category and TROs in\nanother for purposes of appealability, reflect kind of a\ncongressional judgment about which is -- which mechanism\nis intended to alter the kind of substantial rights.\nAnd absent the rights to appeal, absent the\nadversariness, the heavier focus on irreparable\ninjuries, unlike at the preliminary injunction stage,\nthose are all things that we think make TROs generally\nineligible to affect prevailing party status.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because the TRO case,\ncharacteristically the other side isn't heard, so you\nhaven't prevailed.\nMR. GALANTER: That is one way to view it,\nYour Honor. Without the adversariness at the hearing,\nthere really was no one to prevail over. Whereas\nhere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I thought you\nprevailed in the sense that you secured relief. That's\nhow you articulated it up to this point.\nMR. GALANTER: Well, this Court has\ncertainly described some relief as the threshold of\nprevailing. I'm simply suggesting that there may be\nother kinds of orders, as this Court suggested in\nHanrahan versus Hampden, that are just not sufficiently\n-- they don't have a sufficient change in the legal\nrelationship between the parties to warrant prevailing\nparty status, even though they do benefit the\nplaintiffs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you surely wouldn't\nsay that the fact that the other side never shows up\nmeans that you can't get your attorney's fees.\nMR. GALANTER: No, Your Honor. What I'm\nsuggesting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're a prevailing\nparty whether there's an adversary on the other side or\nnot.\nMR. GALANTER: What I'm saying is that the\nTRO anticipates that, which is in part why we're not\nsuggesting TROs are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But in this very\ncase, if you had gotten a TRO instead of a preliminary\ninjunction, you'd have exactly the same practical\nsituation.\nMR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor, but we were\n-- we did have a preliminary injunction. The State\ntherefore did have a right to appeal, and a lot of other\nconsequences flow from the fact that there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State did make a\npoint, that they were kind of -- this was short notice\nand they were doing the best they could on short notice.\nI mean, they showed up but only sort of.\nMR. GALANTER: With three attorneys, Your\nHonor. And yes -- and we both have our stories about\nwhy there was short notice. Ours is they only told us a\nweek before they weren't going to allow her to protest\nnude. And so we moved as quickly as we could. And this\nis what often happens in election cases, demonstrations,\nparades, religious exercise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the regulations\ntold you weren't allowed to protest nude.\nMR. GALANTER: Your Honor, those same\nregulations had been in effect the four previous times\nshe had protested nude. And it was consistent with the\nstipulation they had entered into that her nudity was\nprotected by the First Amendment. So again, she was\ncertainly entitled to negotiate as she tried to do with\nthe State. She was told one week before that she\nwouldn't be allowed to do this. She went to court. She\ngot the very relief that she sought and she was able to\nprotest in the nude.\nNow in the other cases, you're going to get\nsomeone who just finds they were denied the right to\nregister or to get on the ballot, and that's going to be\ndisposed of immediately. It won't be capable of\nrepetition by evading review because the person is now\nregistered, the election is now over. Maybe that\ncandidate won't run again. So we have a whole core of\nFirst Amendment cases that will be affected if\nPetitioner's per se rule that preliminary injunction is\nnever enough goes into play, because then States have\nthe unfortunate incentive of pushing the decisions very\nclose to the actual event deadline so that even if they\nlose in court, they won't have to pay attorney's fees.\nAnd I would add that in terms of the broader\nnotion, here we have a midlevel state official sending a\nletter to an individual saying we don't think you have\nany First Amendment rights, and if you come, you'll be\nviolating a law that's subject to criminal arrest, if\nyou come and you're naked, you're going to be subject to\ncriminal arrest. Absent Section 1998, it would be\nincredibly difficult for persons in Ms. Wyner's\nsituation to find attorneys.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Seitz, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY VIRGINIA A. SEITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Seitz, would you\nclarify that point about costs? Did your client have to\npay costs?\nMS. SEITZ: The plaintiffs were awarded\ncosts incurred on the preliminary injunction. My client\nwas awarded a right to costs on the remainder of the\nlitigation. Those costs were reduced to mirror the\nprecise costs that the plaintiff was awarded on\npreliminary injunction, so in the end no one received\nany costs. But costs were allocated for plaintiffs for\nthe preliminary injunction, and defendants for the\nremainder of the case.\nI just want to make one point about the\ntiming. The time prior to the 2003 demonstration, in\n2000 she wrote a letter requesting the right to protest\nnude and received a denial letter in response, similar\nto the one she received in 2003. So she was on notice\nas of 2000 that we were enforcing the nudity ban against\nher activities.\nSecond, I want to say that the district\ncourt itself characterized its holding on summary\njudgment, quote, \"as plaintiffs are unable to show\nactual success on the merits,\" page 34a of the appendix.\nSo there's no doubt that what even the court understood\nits own holding to be was that the prediction in the\npreliminary injunction had failed to materialize when\nthe court considered the full case on the merits.\nAnd finally, I want to say that awarding\nfees, conferring fees for a plaintiff for obtaining a\npreliminary injunction essentially requires the State\ntreasury to pay its opponents when, in fact, the State\nhas done nothing but enforce a valid law. And we know\nthat in this case because the case ended up getting\nlitigated to conclusion. But simply because we don't\nknow that in other cases involving preliminary\ninjunctions doesn't mean it isn't true, and that's why\nit's fundamentally unfair to impose fees on State\ndefendants and local governments that haven't had a full\nand fair opportunity to defend their legal position.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
