MACHAT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis case concerns whether or not a defendant in\na trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements\nof the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence\nof likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of\nthat affirmative defense.\nNow, here are four reasons why that should not\nbe the case. In the first place, if that is the case it\nwould render the defense useless, because if there is no\nlikelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark\ninfringement to begin with, so why should someone try to\nprove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark\ninfringement? Second -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You agree with Judge\nNiemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.\nMR. MACHAT: Yes.\nSecondly, what it does is, is it shifts the\nburden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.\nThere's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to\nprove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a\ndefendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove\nthe fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence\nof likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of\na burden. You have to prove, first of all -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: In this case, did the\nplaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer\nconfusion?\nMR. MACHAT: This was a motion for summary\njudgement.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there anything in the\naffidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer\nconfusion on behalf of the plaintiff?\nMR. MACHAT: Yeah, actually, the record does\ncontain some references to confusion. The -- in this\ncase, the respondent, they were claiming that they did\nhave some people that actually were confused. And when\nthat happens, you need to look at what is causing the\nconfusion. And essentially -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it might make it\nnecessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to\navoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer\nevidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't\nany.\nMR. MACHAT: Well, but that's shifting the\nissue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of\nconfusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is\neven if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of\nthe fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any\nresulting confusion.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is it possible that\nshowing consumer confusion could be considered by the\ncourt on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair?\nMR. MACHAT: Well, the thing is, a lot of times\nwhen there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or\nthe word being used is not being used as a mark, so the\nconfusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the\nfair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used\ndescriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements\nare being met.\nThe confusion does not go to the likelihood of\nconfusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual\nelements of the fair-use -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm interested in\nJustice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to\nwhether or not the use is in good faith and it's only\ndiscretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's\nvery substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly\ninfringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith\nassessment?\nIn other words, suppose that it were shown that\nthe owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged\ninfringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used\nthe phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion.\nWould that -\nMR. MACHAT: Yes -- well, that would show an\nabsence of good faith, and good faith is one of the\nelements of the fair-use defense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so that if you know\nthat there's going to be confusion, there is no good\nfaith? You wouldn't go that far.\nMR. MACHAT: No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a\nbalancing Test and that's why it says \"fairly and in good\nfaith,\" and you have to look at how descriptive the word\nis, in particular.\nFor instance, if you're using the word \"best\" -\nas in \"best buy\" or \"best foods\" -- I mean, best is an\nextremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further\nin claiming, \"Hey, I have the best -- I have the best\nfood,\" or, you know, \"Come to my store. I have the best\nbuy.\" And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one\nof the risks that -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is it your position\nthat subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter\nhow unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is\nthat your position?\nMR. MACHAT: No, I wouldn't go that far, because\nyou also have to look at the objective use.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would have thought that\nconsumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness;\nperhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the\nissue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position,\ndo they not?\nMR. MACHAT: Well, I think -- I was reading the\namici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion,\nas the INTA brief points out, you have to look at\nwhether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not\nthe term is being used as a mark or not. The same\nevidence that shows confusion can be used to show a\nlikelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the\ncase, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the\ncase of determining whether or not the elements of a fair\nuse defense have been -- have been met.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What did -- what did\nthe district court do here? Did it grant summary\njudgement or deny summary judgement?\nMR. MACHAT: The -- well, the district court\ngranted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found\nthat, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that\nmy client's words were being used not as a mark, only to\ndescribe, and that the use was done fairly and in good\nfaith. The Ninth Circuit -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district court -- the\ndistrict court -- this way --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- seemed to focus on the use\nof the word \"micro color,\" just the word. It didn't bring\nup what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears\nwhere \"micro color\" is not simply a word, but it appears\nin a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the\ndistrict court said you could use \"micro color\" as you had\nbeen using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized\n1999 new brochure. So -\nMR. MACHAT: Yes, that is correct. The district\ncourt, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that\nuse in 1999.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it might not have been\nconfusion just by using the word. But when you're using\nit in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.\nMR. MACHAT: Well, in the abstract case, it\ncould be. I would argue, though, in this case it's not,\nbecause that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page\nbrochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And\nyou -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very\nbottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that wouldn't relate to\nthe question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate\nto the reason for which we took this case.\nMR. MACHAT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, maybe the district\ncourt misinterpreted or misapplied \"fairly and in good\nfaith\" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I\nunderstand it, the only question we have before us is\nwhether the \"fairly and in good faith\" provision is an\nexception even when there is confusion.\nMR. MACHAT: Yes, I would agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed\nup. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your\nside, have to present evidence of no confusion.\nMR. MACHAT: Yes, I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So as far as -\nMR. MACHAT: -- I think we're both saying the\nsame thing\nJUSTICE BREYER: So as far as Justice O'Connor's\nquestion is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if\nthey want to go and present evidence that there is\nconfusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair,\nit's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to\nthat?\nMR. MACHAT: No, I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. So your answer to her\nquestion is, of course it could be relevant. Let the\nother side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't\nhave to show that there is no confusion.\nMR. MACHAT: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where we are, is that\nright?\nMR. MACHAT: That's exactly -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. MACHAT: -- where we are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you give us a -- I'd be\nmuch more sympathetic to your case if I could readily\nenvision a situation where there is confusion but,\nnonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a\nclear example.\nMR. MACHAT: In my particular case? This -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I mean, make up one -\nMR. MACHAT: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's really clear.\nMR. MACHAT: Let's use the words \"best buy.\"\nBest Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and\nsomebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, \"Mark's,\nhe has the best buy.\" He wants to advertise on radio,\n\"Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for\nthe best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's,\" and\nhe keeps using those words \"best buy.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there's any\nlikelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean -\nMR. MACHAT: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what if he just takes out an\nad that says, \"Best Buy,\" exclamation point? That would\nbe closer.\nMR. MACHAT: Okay, in that case there would be\nconfusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using \"best\nbuy\" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore,\nhe would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair\nuse defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes\nup, it comes up in the case that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to make it that\nin my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type\nat the beginning of the piece, \"Best Buy,\" exclamation\npoint. That means it's a trademark?\nMR. MACHAT: Well, it would be evidence that it\nis a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the\nwords \"best buy\" were in relation to the word \"Mark's\nElectronics.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but if you had a\n-- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, \"Great\nSale,\" that surely is not a trademark, just because you\nhave it in boldfaced print.\nMR. MACHAT: I agree, it's not necessarily a\ntrademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad,\nand you have to look at what the person is trying to use\nto tell consumers to identify and distinguish the\nproducts, or, in this case, the store.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if you have a sign\nthat says \"Park `n Fly\" and an arrow, with a capital \"P\"\nand a capital \"F,\" then it's arguably being used as a\ntrademark.\nMR. MACHAT: Well -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Whereas, if you say in a\nbrochure, \"Rent a car from us, and park and fly,\" then\nthat's okay. Is that the distinction?\nMR. MACHAT: Yes, but I'd go even further and\nsay that the -- if you had a big sign that said \"Park `n\nFly,\" and it's next to an airport, that would not\nnecessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like,\n\"Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly,\" I would say\nthat's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue\ndifferently in that case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth -- the Ninth\nCircuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on\nthe trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at\nthe petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to\nrecognize that the trademark-holder must show that the\nalleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause\nconfusion or to cause mistake or to deceive.\nSo this opinion starts out by saying, \"Yes, we\nknow that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is\nobliged to show likelihood of confusion.\"\nMR. MACHAT: They do it. But then on -- if you\nlook on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion,\nthe Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle\nparagraph, \"As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis\nonly complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood\nof customer confusion analysis.\" And then they quote from\nTransgo, and they say -- explain that \"anyone is free to\nuse a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as\nsuch use does not result in consumer confusion as to the\nsource of goods.\"\nIn effect, what they're doing is, they're\nexpanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive\nwords. Essentially what they're saying is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, they go further\nin that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer\nto a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they\ndescribed, explaining that the fair-use defense is not\navailable if likelihood of confusion has been shown.\nMR. MACHAT: Right, and that's -- that's where\nthey're negating what they said in the beginning of their\nopinion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They do have one authority\nfor that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think\nthey're right about that.\nMR. MACHAT: Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I\nwould submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a treatise\nwriter who does take the position that if there's\nconfusion, there's no fair-use defense.\nMR. MACHAT: Well, there are other treatise\nwriters -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position\nand says that fair use will always be a defense, even if\n- even if there is likelihood of confusion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So does the -- what is it -\nthe unfair competition restatement?\nMR. MACHAT: Yes, that takes a similar position,\nas well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the\nsame time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the\nconfusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is\nbeing caused because the person with the words in question\nis using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion.\nIf -- there's certain -- there's certain -\nthere's certain terms and words that Congress has said\nnever get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of\ncourse, is one of them, in the sense that they can never\nget trademark protection in their primary descriptive\nsense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in\ntheir secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove\nsecondary meaning.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought we're dealing\nwith an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning\nwould be assumed.\nMR. MACHAT: Yes. In the case of an\nincontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed;\nhowever, that still does not take away the burden of the\nholder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of\nconfusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches\nonly to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the\nprimary, descriptive meaning of the words in question.\nAnd one other quick example. The laws say you\ncannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have\n12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on\ntheir ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone\nwill say, \"I want the ice cream with the flag on it.\" But\nthey all have a flag on it. That's another example where\nCongress said, \"We will tolerate confusion.\" Sometimes we\ntolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so\nbusiness owners are free to describe their goods to\nconsumers.\nAnd, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Machat.\nNow, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Scalia, you asked for an example of a\ncase where there might be confusion, but there would still\nbe a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner\nversus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on\npage 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had\nCoco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold.\nAnd this Court held, as a matter of the common\nlaw fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair,\ntruthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product\nwill be permitted even if consumer mistakes result.\nThere are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe\nScale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus\nClark case.\nThe fair-use defense that's at issue here takes\nits -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and\nthat common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly,\nJustice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to\nyour questions about, what does a fairness component of\nthis test in the statute mean.\nThere is not a general requirement that the -\nsay, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but\nthe non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what\nCongress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can\nsee, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief\n-- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -\nputting that aside, used fairly only to describe the\nproduct.\nThat is not some sort of general equitable\nreceptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what\nthe defendant did and how they acted in describing.\nThat's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the\ndefendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner,\nCanal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at.\nIn common parlance, in a common dictionary\nmeaning, when you talk about fairly describing something,\nthat's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate,\nreasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to\ndescribe a product. One could reasonably --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does -- does consumer\n-- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the\nplaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?\nMS. MILLETT: Not by itself, no, Justice\nO'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense,\nand that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is\nbeing used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you\ncould explain that that demonstrates that it's being used\nas a mark. It might show that you're not objectively,\nreasonably, accurately describing your product.\nIf I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's\na -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I\ncan't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, in the Coco-quinine\ncase, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine\nwithout using the particular term, and then he decides,\n\"you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm\ngoing to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do\nthat just in order to get more customers away from the\ntrademark-holder.\" Is that good faith?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, because there's nothing, in\nthe marketplace, with wanting to increase your business\nand to do better and to use descriptive terms\ndescriptively to do that. The good-faith -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -\nMS. MILLETT: -- continued here -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what if he intends to\nincrease his market share precisely by causing the\nconfusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element,\nwouldn't it?\nMS. MILLETT: The good-faith element is, do I\nintend -- it depends on what you mean by \"causing\nconfusion.\" If I intend to freeload or ride or exploit\nthe secondary -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yeah.\nMS. MILLETT: -- meaning of the term -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: -- that's what good faith means in\ntrademark law, generally. It has an established\ncomponent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: If I intend to do that. But just\nshowing that consumer confusion could result, or that I\nhope consumers will pause and think about, you know, \"what\n-- what's in the -- what am I now being offered in the\nmarketplace?\" But I have to -- if I intend to avail\nmyself of the secondary meaning that you've established of\nthe goodwill that you've generated, that's what good faith\ngoes to.\nBut to use fairly to describe is not a general\nmeans of just saying -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you -\nMS. MILLETT: -- if there's confusion, that's a\nbad -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What does the term \"micro\ncolor\" describe?\nMS. MILLETT: The term \"micro color\" describes\n-- this is not my area of expertise, but -- describes, as\nI understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent\nmake-up process. And the reason it's called \"micro color\"\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does it have a meaning in any\ncontext other than describing the -- one party's product\nin this case?\nMS. MILLETT: I wouldn't begin to know whether\nother professions or occupations use the term \"micro\ncolor.\" But my understanding, from the record, is that\nthe color is obvious. That's -- it's different color\ninks.\nAnd the reason that they use the term \"micro\" -\nand this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of\nthe joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these\ninks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's\nmicron-size.\nAnd so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by\npetitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term\n\"micro color.\"\nNow, \"micro\" is a common term that's -- common\ndescriptive term in its own right. It appears in many\ncontexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all\nfamiliar with. Medical devices often will refer to\n\"micro.\" But \"micro color\" -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there -- wasn't there\nsomething to the effect that \"micro pigmentation\" is a\nsynonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another\nname for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has \"micro\" in\nit, \"micro pigmentation.\"\nMS. MILLETT: That's my understanding, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: \"Micro pigmentation\" sounds\nawfully close to \"micro color.\"\nMS. MILLETT: \"Micro color,\" yeah. That's my\nunderstanding. Again, I don't really want to weigh in on\none side of the dispute or the other on the merits of\nwhether \"micro color\" is a generic or a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to weigh in on\nit. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me,\nif you think that side should win, that the words are\nbeing used in a descriptive sense. And if \"micro color\"\ndoesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they\nassociate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you\nlose.\nMS. MILLETT: But, Justice Scalia, the problem\nhere is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them\nlose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe\ntheir product, or not that they failed to act in good\nfaith, or not that they were using this as a trademark,\nbut that it was a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're right, that's not the\nissue in the case.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. Right. And my\nunderstanding -- again, the record shows that, in fact,\nthe descriptive use of this was conceded in this case, and\nthat's on page 29a of the petition appendix, and also in\nthe joint appendix on 152.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're right.\nMS. MILLETT: But, again, our concern is that\nthis statute has to be read with the terms Congress\nenacted. Congress drew a balance here. Congress struck\nthe balance between allowing -- giving unprecedented\nprotection that this Court recognized in \"Park 'n Fly\" to\ndescriptive terms, but policing the line between the\nsecondary meaning that attaches to descriptive terms and\nthe -- reserving for the marketplace, for competition, the\navailability of descriptive terms in their original\ndescriptive sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, if you choose\nto use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your\nchances -\nMS. MILLETT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that that descriptive term\nwill be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and\ncause confusion.\nMS. MILLETT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if you don't want\nconfusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.\nMS. MILLETT: That's exactly right. There's a\ntradeoff. When you pick a descriptive term, you get right\nup front, right up front, the immediate appeal and\nresonance of a term to the -- to the consumers. \"Best\nbuy.\" Who wouldn't want the best buy? I want the best\nbuy. \"Chunky\" candy bars. It's going to be easier to\nbreak into the marketplace with \"Chunky\" candy bars or\n\"Almond Joy\" candy bars, because consumers will have a\nsense of what they're getting, than if you come in with a\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Schwartz,\" \"Schwartz\" candy\nbars.\nMS. MILLETT: \"Schwartz\" candy bar, \"Kodak,\" I\ndon't know\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't do anything for you.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. MILLETT: I don't know why that is, and why\nwould I want to eat it. They're going to have to do more\nwork. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said,\nJustice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms\nout of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words.\nAnd if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair,\nin the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as\nthis Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe\nScale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg\nversus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case,\nif it's apt and accurate, that's what \"used fairly\" means.\nAnd if its satisfies that objective test, and if\nit satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's not\nused as a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, because\nthat -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you tell whether it's\nused as a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems\nto be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as\na mark, then there is a violation.\nMS. MILLETT: The fair-use defense is\nunavailable if it's used as a mark. There are other --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: -- defenses that are available,\nbut the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable.\nThat's correct.\nThe way you prove whether something is used as a\nmark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end.\nWhen something is used as a mark, that means it is\nsignifying to the origin or source of those goods in the\nmarketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling\nyou who is making it or who is putting it out on the\nmarket.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So let's go back to the use\non the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as\nthey're using just the word \"micro color,\" I see your\nposition entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark.\nBut what about when they use something that looks like a\nmark?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, there's -- there's going to\nbe difficult questions of proof. Our position is that, by\ntaking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign\neverybody else to ten point Times New Roman font, and that\nthey can do some colorful display, but not a mark.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nMillett.\nMs. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nDefendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is\ncontrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of\nthe fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to\nJustice Scalia's question about this is the risk that\nsomeone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this\ndefense does not apply only to descriptive terms.\nUnder Petitioner's view, this defense would be\navailable to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive\nmarks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a\nmark. Indeed, our mark here is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you use a fanciful term\ndescriptively? I mean, I think that's the definition of\nan arbitrary or fanciful term, that it doesn't mean\nanything.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, it may mean something in a\ndifferent context, I think an example you could use would\nbe the arbitrary trademark of \"Apple\" for computers.\nThere could be advertising for Computer Electronics,\nIncorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school\nrush, using the term \"Apple\" in a descriptive sense:\n\"Apples for Teachers,\" you know, the beginning of the\nyear, \"Come to our store.\"\nSo, in reliance on that, you drive two hours\nbecause you're the school district director who needs to\nbuy ten new computers to hook into the system. You get\nthere, it turns out they're not Apple Computers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but do they use the apple\nas clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning,\nthat's what gives it protection. But if you have an\narbitrary term, as Justice Scalia says, how could that be,\nhow could the defense have any relevance to a fanciful or\narbitrary term. And I thought the defense only was\nrelevant when you -- everybody agrees you're talking about\ndescriptive terms?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, the Solicitor\nGeneral does not take that position either, in their brief\nthey recognize that this applies to all level of mark.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that, all we need to\ndecide this case is to assume that it's descriptive.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, the Ninth\nCircuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive,\nor descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as\nwas pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be\nfound in the English language anywhere, it doesn't\ndescribe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests\nthe small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately\nused when this is applied.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that it was\ndescriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply?\nThat you would have to show absence of confusion before\nyou raised the good faith defense?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that's what the\nNinth Circuit test does, this was a summary judgment\nentered against us when we had introduced -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you agree, then,\nthat in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non\ntrademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the\nfair-use defense without having to show that there's no\nconfusion?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, we believe it's the\nplaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden\nto show likelihood of confusion. The point is, under the\ndistrict court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence\nin this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment\nwas entered against us because the district court took\nPetitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance\nwhatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination\nof fair use, that's the rule in the Ninth Circuit overall,\nand that's what needs to be affirmed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm confused. I thought\nthe question you're supposed to answer, which is in the\nblue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of\nconfusion. And I guess now you agree the answer to that\nquestion is \"no.\" Is that right, you agree with that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the end of this\ncase, isn't it? That's what we took it to decide, and\nthat's -- you agree with it and they agree with it, so\neverybody's happy. We don't even have to write an\nopinion, we can just--\nMS. BRINKMANN: I believe the Petitioner came up\nwith that formulation because they had taken on the burden\nbecause they were the movant on summary judgment. That's\nwhere that misnomer came from.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you object to the\nformulation of the question presented? Here's the\nquestion, \"Does the classic fair-use defense to trademark\ninfringement require the party asserting the defense to\ndemonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion?\" That's\nthe question. And you say, \"no.\"\nMS. BRINKMANN: We agree that the plaintiff,\nit's clear that under - in the Ninth Circuit - the Ninth\nCircuit pointed out that, Justice Ginsburg quoted before,\nmade clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of\nestablishing likelihood of confusion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose you establish it,\nmaybe we can find some differences here, would you also\nagree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to\novercome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show\nthat the confusion, along with possibly other things are\nsuch that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word,\nunfairness, or lack of good faith?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We believe that when Congress -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You agree with that, or not?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, we agree that\nwhen Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms\n\"used fairly\" to refer to the common law, which included\nnot only the common law of technical trademark, but the\ncommon law of unfair competition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Good, so now we have something\nI can disagree with you about. Now, the question would\nbe, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show\nthere's some confusion, which normally there would be, or\nquite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome\ntheir defense that they put here?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the time that those\nwords were used, the common law, and we respectfully\ndisagree with the Solicitor General's office on the\nreading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that. The\nreason the Court allowed the use of the term in that case\nis because they quite clearly said it did not have a\nsecondary meaning. There is no trademark protection for\ndescriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in\ncomplete agreement with that. We're dealing with the\nsecondary meaning.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, so now, if we're\ngoing to go back into what the Court did, I would say that\nI was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get\nprotection at all, because I was thinking \"micro color,\"\nwell, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny,\nteeny, weenie, weenie bit of color.\nAnd when I think of \"micro pigment,\" I think of\na farm animal, I think -- I don't know what I think, it's\nconfusing me. So, for an average person, the word \"micro\ncolor,\" I thought, \"Gee, that's very descriptive of just\nwhat it is, a teeny weenie bit of color.\"\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, I would urge\nyou to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it\nlists twenty other competitors that sell this very\nproduct, they have no cause to use that word. It is not\nused in the industry as a descriptive term, they're called\n\"pigment,\" they're called \"ink,\" they're not called \"micro\ncolors,\" that is my client's trademark.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference between\npigment and color, especially when it's not just \"micro\ncolor,\" don't they advertise \"micro color red,\" \"micro\ncolor grey,\" so pigment -\nMS. BRINKMANN: The typical suggestive term, it\nwas created to associate the high quality that my client\nmarkets in this product with that term, I want the \"micro\ncolor\" pigments, not the other pigments that are sold by\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, what about the word, is\nit -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the\nword, \"micro pigmentation\" is used in the trade as a\nsynonym for permanent makeup?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's correct, and oftentimes,\ntrademarks are shortened versions of other terminology.\nThe fact is it is suggestive because \"micro colors\" is the\nprotected trademark here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there is a sense of color\nin which color is synonymous with pigment. And I assume\nthat's what was accepted here, which leads me to my\nquestion, I don't understand why we're having this\ndiscussion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because I thought it was agreed\nthat for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive\nuse, is that incorrect?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of\nthe defense, it's the other party that has to be using the\nterm differently.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could you just point to\nme -- I'm not asking so much about the \"why,\" I just want\nto know what this case is. Is there someplace in the\nmaterials that we've got that indicate that, in fact, you\ndispute that there is a descriptive use here?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, footnote 3 of the red brief\nexplains that this purported concession that they discuss\nabout the use of this mark had to do because Justice\nGinsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a\nbottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but\nassuming they occurred, those were descriptive. In 1998\nand 1999, Petitioner started using this on their marketing\nbrochures in a very different manner.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, this still goes to\nthe merits of the defense and not to the question\npresented. The question presented is, descriptive or not\ndescriptive, do you have a defense if it's, if there is\nconsumer confusion? And your position, if you're opposing\nthe question presented, is that if there is consumer\nconfusion, there is no defense. And it's -- I thought\nthat was the only question you were going to discuss here,\nnot in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has\nbeen made out in this case, because these words were or\nwere not descriptive. I mean, that's a -\nMS. BRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor, I'd be\nhappy to discuss that. As I pointed out, it's contrary to\nthe textual language used by the Congress in 1946. They\nmeant \"used fairly\" to mean what the common law meant.\nThe common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical\ntrademarks and trade names.\nMoreover, Petitioner's interpretation is\ncontrary to the clear focus of the Lanham Act, which is to\nprevent customer confusion. The whole point is so that\nyou can walk into a store -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, may I stop you\nthere, because I thought you have conceded, as I think you\nmust, I thought you conceded quite clearly, I wrote down\nthat you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show\nlikelihood of confusion. So, if it's the plaintiff's\nburden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the\ndefendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe it's the\ndefendant's burden, we believe we -- the district court\nwas correctly reversed by the Ninth Circuit in entering\nsummary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that\nthere was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion. And\nthe district court did that, because as I said it was\nabsolutely irrelevant to the determination of used\nfairly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I think this is really\nquite confusing, Ms. Brinkmann. The question presented,\nas several people have pointed out, whether the Lanham\nAct's fair-use defense to trademark infringement requires\na party asserting the defense to demonstrate the absence\nof a likelihood of consumer confusion.\nNow, do you agree or disagree with that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You can surely answer\nthat, \"we agree,\" or \"we don't agree.\"\nMS. BRINKMANN: We don't agree. We believe that\nlikelihood of confusion defeats the fair-use defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Okay, okay.\nMS. BRINKMANN: And we would point out that as a\ntextual argument and the purpose argument -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, may I just\ninterrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the\ndefense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case,\nprima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of\nestablishing likelihood of confusion. So, is there any\nroom for the defense at all?\nMS. BRINKMANN: As we point out in our brief,\nYour Honor, we do believe that since the amendment in\n1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the\nplaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the answer is no.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It remains as a Congressional\nemphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use\nthat is not likely to confuse is allowed. That is what,\nthis was a -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's allowed without the\naffirmative defense.\nMS. BRINKMANN: To understand why this came in,\nit's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied\nonly to incontestable marks. It did not apply to other\nregistered marks.\nAt that time, incontestable mark holders did not\nhave to prove likelihood of confusion. That incontestable\nmark was a conclusive evidence of the mark holder's\nexclusive right to use that mark on the same goods. Same\nmark, on the same goods that were set forth in the\naffidavit with the PTO. That was akin to early common\nlaw.\nAt that point, the plaintiff could go into court\nwith their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive\nevidence. So there had to be a safety valve for\ndefendants to be able to say, \"Okay, I know this is an\nincontestable mark, I know that, and I know I'm using it\non the same goods, but notwithstanding, I can use it\nbecause I'm using it fairly, I'm not confusing consumers\nwith this. That's what the purpose was. In 19 -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But are you suggesting, I want\nto be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in,\nback in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark\ndid not have to prove likelihood of confusion?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It was presumed by the weight of\nthat, that was the conclusive evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because otherwise, wouldn't\nthat defeat the defense, too, then?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because the way Congress\nstructured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except\nsubject to the seven specific defenses, this was the\nfourth one.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying, isn't\nyour answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable\npresumption?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Yes, Your\nHonor. I would also point out that when Congress amended\nin 1988, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that\nthey intended to change this and that's what's so\nfundamental about the position - the district court\nposition. This is a gaping hole in the core purpose of\nthe Lanham Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose IBM had used the\nword \"computers\" when they were the only company for ten\nor fifteen years to mark their product. Now, another\ncompany comes along and they produce the same thing, they\nwant to use the word \"computer.\" You're saying that that\nwould be the end of it, they couldn't do it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Not at all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: People would be confused. For\na while they'll think that \"computer\" refers to IBM, there\nwould be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the\nproduct, in fact, at least a very good one.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, if that were the\ncase, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a\ngeneric term with no protection.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, at the very beginning,\nIBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it\ncomputer, they could have called it a word processor, they\ncould have called it a \"think faster.\" I don't know what\nthey could have called it, but I mean, you know, they\nchose the word computer.\nMS. BRINKMANN: And Congress took that\nexplicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be\ncanceled at any time for genericism. Escalator, aspirin\nare all examples of your situation. That's exactly what\nhappened, and when they came a generic term, that\ntrademark was canceled and it became used as generic.\nCongress took that into account.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is this fair-use\ndefense for, since you're normally going to show confusion\nto show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Since 1988 it's a vestigial\nreminder of what Congress wanted to make sure was\nunderstood in 1946. Even for the strongest, incontestable\nmark on the same goods, we are still going to always allow\nuses that are not likely to confuse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't usually interpret\nstatutes that way. I mean, you tell us what Congress had\nin mind, but our best indication of what Congress had in\nmind is the words of the statute. And the words of the\nstatute make no sense if they say you have to prove\nconfusion and the only -- however, there's a special\ndefense which you have, which turns out to be there's no\nconfusion, that's not a special defense.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Two points, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Makes it a meaningless statute,\nreally.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Two points. Petitioner gives no\nmeaning to words \"used fairly.\" So if a worst statutory\nconstruction -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they did when they\noutlined to us what it means is you're using it\ndescriptively, and not as a mark.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, those are other\nterms that are used in the statute, those are separate\nrequirements. There are four requirements in the\nprovision, used not as a mark, used descriptively, used in\ngood faith, and used fairly. They read \"used fairly\"\nright out of the language.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, am I right\nthat several cases say, the key here is, are you using it\nas a mark. Because that suggests you're trying to pawn\noff your goods as another's. Are you using it as a mark?\nOr, are you using it, merely descriptively? I thought use\nas a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're\nnot using it in good faith.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, that is one of the factors\nin likelihood of confusion, that you can take into\naccount, that there can be non-trademark uses that are\nconfusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full\nof examples of that.\nI would like to make one other response to\nJustice Scalia's point, if I could. Justice Scalia, to\nthe extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no\nlonger prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as\nunfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici\nthat there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in\nany event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used\nfairly determination, as Petitioner in the district court\nwould have it.\nWe discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example,\nthe Restatement's position, which we would urge the Court\nto look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but I don't\nthink that's the question presented here. I mean, we\ncould agree with that, that it's relevant to deciding the\ndefense, and still answer the question presented the way\nthat the Petitioner wants.\nMS. BRINKMANN: The district court's entry of\nsummary judgment must be reversed, the Ninth Circuit did\nthat because of its total disregard for likely to\nconfusion -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but the\nissue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too\nfar in the other direction and required too much. And all\nwe have to determine is whether there is a per se\nobligation to prove non-confusion. If we do so, that\ndoesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's\nposition, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too\nfar, isn't that correct? I mean, that is what is -- that\nis the issue before us?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think the ruling from this\nCourt would have to be that it's not an absolute defense\nagainst likelihood of confusion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about if the ruling were\na defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good\nfaith to describe its goods or services is not liable for\ninfringement, even if some residual confusion is likely.\nThat's what the Restatement that you've just been\napplauding says.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, and that discussion\nexplains a couple of things. It explains that if there is\na likelihood of substantial confusion, that would be the\nouter limit, ordinarily that would not be a fair use. It\nalso points out that likelihood of confusion is relevant\nto that determination that Your Honor just described.\nYes, we would win under that position, Your Honor, that's\nabsolutely correct, that's the middle ground of the\nRestatement -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would win -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You'd still have to vacate\nthe judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying\nthat if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of\nit.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we would\nactually urge the Court to affirm the judgment below, in\nsupport of we cite cases in our brief, the Meritor case\nand the Yakima case, in which the judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit reversing the district court should be affirmed,\nand there are other holdings of the Ninth Circuit also\nthat are not before the Court that should be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you're urging\nthen that the Ninth Circuit be affirmed on alternate\ngrounds.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that's -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We rarely do that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, I understand\nthat, but in this particular situation -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why wouldn't we just vacate\nit, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't\naddress, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate\nthe judgment and send it back?\nMS. BRINKMANN: We certainly would agree, Your\nHonor, that if we are then given an opportunity on remand\nto go back to summary judgment and carry our burden of\nestablishing a likelihood of confusion, but not have it\nheld against us. For example, in the middle ground, to\ndetermine what used fairly is, in addition to likelihood\nof confusion, we would suggest that there are other\nfactors that the Restatement puts forth. For example,\nwhether there is commercial justification for the use.\nDid we point out, there is no commercial justification,\nthere are twenty other competitors that don't use this\nterminology.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They might have been afraid\nthat you'd sue them.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's quite a strong mark, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, am I right\nthat they were, \"they\" being KP, they were in fact using\nthe word \"micro color\" before you registered your\ntrademark?\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, we dispute that, Your Honor,\nthey've never produced one bottle from that period. In\nfact, we introduced four bottles of their -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be -- that\nwould be a disputed issue of fact.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And are we making any\ndifferentiation at all between the mini color red or\nwhatever, and this logo that appears?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, all the difference in the\nworld, Your Honor. We maintain that that is a mark use.\nI mean, the district court rejected that as well, but that\nis one of the issues where you suggested that courts have\nresolved these on whether something is used as a mark or\nnot, that is not an easy answer, and that is why it's\nalways part and parcel of the likelihood of confusion.\nThat's the purpose of the Lanham Act, to ensure\nthat when you go into a store, you can buy the products\nyou want. For example, in the health and safety area\nhere, you may be willing to buy a product that costs more\nmoney because you know of the quality of them. At the\nsame time, you want to be assured when you go in, because\nyou don't want to buy the one that's recalled all the\ntime, or that has ingredients that cause allergies for\nyou, that's what the Lanham Act is to protect. And it\nencourages the economic efficiency of the market -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your customers are pretty\nsophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an\nunusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking\noff the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably\nknow this market pretty well.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's directly relevant to the\nlikelihood of confusion, Your Honor. In fact, the typical\nway of proving that when it ultimately goes to trial is\nthrough consumer survey. And the law is clear that that\nsurvey would not be of the person on the street, it would\nbe of the appropriate purchasers, who are more\nsophisticated clinicians and cosmetologists.\nBut, Your Honor, even on that situation in this\nrecord, we have direct evidence of confusion. It's at\njoint appendix page 170, Your Honor, it's the declaration\nof Gloria Torres, where about 1998, 1999, she was one of\nthe people who did sales, and she started getting calls\nfrom people wanting products, and it confused her because\nthey weren't on my client's customer list, and also they\nwere citing different prices. It didn't mean anything to\nher at the time, it turns out this was the confusion\nbecause they were actually seeing this new usage on the\nmarketing brochure by KP Permanent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just out of curiosity, it has\nnothing to do with the case, do they market this product\nwith color charts, just like paint companies do?\nMS. BRINKMANN: They do, Your Honor, that's\nabsolutely right, color wheels, color -- and also in the\nmicro pigmentation history, it's very important, because\neven though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely\nthe opposite, it's to hide the color. So mixing of the\ncolors is a critical component of that industry.\nI want to make another point about the economic\nefficiency that is furthered by the trademark laws and not\nallowing likelihood of confusing uses, which is what\nCongress intended. By allowing purchasers to know that\nthey're getting the product that they want, they're a lot,\nable to be more efficient in the market -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I also -- it's very efficient\nto allow people to communicate, in English.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, there's nothing to\nprevent that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I guess that's the\nquestion, because sometimes people -- I have no doubt -\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I don't think\nthere's anything -- the way that Petitioner passed the\nLanham Act grossly overstates it. I mean, I would just\nsubmit the following list. The only thing that the Lanham\n-- the Lanham Act does not allow registration of generic\nbrands, as we mentioned before.\nIt allows cancellation of any mark if it becomes\ngeneric. It applies only to commercial uses, not usage in\nordinary English language, only in connection with the\nmark. It can only have a valid trademark when it's\nactively being used, any mark can be canceled or abandoned\nafter three years.\nIt also, of course, only applies when there's\nlikelihood of confusion. Also there is an expert agency\nthat reviews and goes through a process in which there can\nbe oppositions, objections, all of this could be brought\nup at that point.\nAnd also Congress directly addressed\nanticompetitive interests when it enacted the statute.\nIt, in 1946, enacted B(7) as a defense for antitrust\nviolations. It also reinforced the Justice Department,\nand the FTC maintains its enforcement authority, and it\nalso had a particular provision that allowed the FTC to go\nin and cancel registration. I'd also point out -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What would be a really\nexpert agency, which you referred to as represented by the\ngovernment here, and it takes the position quite different\nfrom yours.\nMS. BRINKMANN: At this point in time, Your\nHonor. I would also point out economic efficiency -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You say at\nthis point in time? Are you suggesting that it took a\ndifferent position some other time?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in this case, it -\nthis mark has been put through becoming to -- but went\nthrough all of the procedures that the PTO required.\nThere's no question that this is a valid mark.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not assailing the\nvalidity of the mark.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Nobody is challenging\nit, it's the fair-use defense.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, no, what I -- the\ngovernment's position is the same position that, in fact,\nit urged before Congress in 1946. The Court's opinion in\nPark 'n Fly makes this clear. They did not want\ndescriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary\nmeaning. And as the Park 'n Fly opinion makes clear,\nCongress rejected that and struck the balance this way and\nincluded all of these other safeguards, not allowing\nregistration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses\nthat are likely to confuse.\nWe would also point out that that encourages\neconomic efficiencies for businesses as well. By being\nable to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the\nbusiness invests more. As soon as confusion is allowed,\nthere is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free\nriding on that investment. And it's a disincentive for\nfurther investment and it undermines the quality of the\ngoods, because the only way -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Certainly the Restatement and\nthe view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on\nthis.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We believe that the Restatement\nand the amici are very consistent in rejecting\nPetitioner's position and the district court's position\nthat likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant. We\nembrace that, I think that's a consistent position, and\nthat would be the bottom line, I would urge, on this\nCourt, because Petitioner's position in the district court\nwreaks havoc, truly, with the statutory framework that\nCongress set up and intended.\nWe believe as a matter of strict statutory\nconstruction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision,\nthe fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the\ninconstestability provision. But if the Court is not\ngoing to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses\nthat are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to\nadopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the\ncircumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we\nthink factors that it's confusing in relationship to a\nhealth and safety issue would be relevant, the investment\nby the mark holder could be relevant. And to the extent\nthe competitor had a commercial justification for it,\nbecause it was a term that everyone needed to use, but\n\"micro colors\" is just not that kind of terminology as the\nrecord in this case demonstrates.\nIf there are no further questions, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nBrinkmann. Mr. Machat, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. MACHAT: Thank you. I'd like to point out\nthat Ms. Brinkmann's reference to the legislative history\nis incorrect, and I'd just like to refer the Court's\nattention to my reply brief, pages 14 to 17 where\nbasically it shows that prior to 1988, courts were\nrequired to find a likelihood of confusion before finding\nfor the plaintiff on a trademark case. I'd also like to\npoint out that in this particular case, the trademark is\nnot for the word \"micro color,\" the trademark is for the\nlogo mark, and here's some of the confusion.\nThe Respondents were able to obtain a trademark\nregistration for the logo itself, and the strength in the\nlogo itself is not being copied, we're just using the\ndescriptive words within the logo itself. And Congress\nalways intended for descriptive words to be free for\neverybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so\nlong as the person, the subsequent user, is not using\nthose descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense,\nand that's the distinction.\nThe confusion is only an issue to determine\nwhether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is\nbeing met, but that confusion should be distinguished from\nlikelihood of confusion. Confusion is a factual\ndetermination, likelihood of confusion is a legal\ndetermination. So you can use whether or not there is\nactual confusion to determine whether or not the mark, sorry,\nthe word is being used as a mark.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I forget your position, if\nyou've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion\nthat is predictable or that is likely is one of the\nelements that can be used to determine whether the use is\na fair one? Do you agree or disagree with that?\nMR. MACHAT: I would agree, the degree of\nconfusion, but that comes into whether or not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right, that's all I wanted\nto know.\nMR. MACHAT: In this case, \"used fairly\" means,\nit does mean something, we're saying used fairly refers to\nwhether or not the use is a truthful or reasonably\naccurate description of the mark. And it always -\ntruthful is something that the common law always looked at\nto see, that was a term used, in fact, by this Court in\nthe Warner decision, basically, to quote briefly from that\ndecision, it said \"the use of a similar name by another to\ntruthfully describe the same product does not constitute\na legal or moral wrong.\"\nSo I would maintain that \"used fairly\" means\ntruthful, or can determine whether or not it's exactly\ntrue, reasonably accurate. And that would be the meaning\nof \"used fairly.\" And of course, good faith refers to the\nintent, and there you have the elements of the fair-use\ndefense.\nAlso, I'd just like to point out once again the\nNinth Circuit opinion, it says on the bottom of page 17a,\nit says, \"KP can only benefit from the fair-use defense if\nthere is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of\nthe term `micro color', and Lasting's mark.\" And then\nthey go on to say, \"as discussed above, because in this\ncase they can be no fair use --\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Machat,\nthe case is submitted.\n(Whereupon at 11:02 a.m., the case in the above\nentitled matter was submitted.)\n"
