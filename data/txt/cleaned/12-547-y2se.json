BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis is a Sixth Circuit habeas appeal\ninvolving AEDPA deference.\nHarrington v. Richter holds that a Federal\ncourt may only overturn a State court conviction that is\nsuch an erroneous misapplication of this Court's clearly\nestablished precedent as to be beyond any possibility of\nfair-minded disagreement. That is, an extreme\nmalfunction.\nHere, a fair-minded jurist could conclude\nthat the Michigan Supreme Court's Carpenter decision was\nneither indefensible nor unexpected when it simply\napplied plain statutory language in accord with\nwell-established Michigan interpretive principles.\nAccordingly, the Michigan Court of Appeals\napplication of Carpenter was not error, and the Sixth\nCircuit should be reversed.\nI'd like to begin with the statutory text.\nIn 1975, the Michigan legislature passed a comprehensive\nmental capacity affirmative defense statute. In it, the\ndefenses are defined for mental illness and mental\nretardation, but it says nothing about diminished\ncapacity. And that silence is crucial here, because in\nMichigan, for over 200 years, it has been a code\njurisdiction, which means that if the statutes address a\nparticular area of criminal law, only that statute\napplies, and the Michigan courts are not allowed to\neither add to or subtract from that statutory text.\nSo only the Michigan legislature had the\npower to add a diminished capacity defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 200 years -- 200 years?\nDid you say that?\nMR. BURSCH: Yes. Actually, even before\nMichigan was a territory -- I'm -- before it was a State\nin 1810, it passed a law that abolished common law\ncriminal principles when there was a statute that\naddressed the -- the subject matter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was some law in\neffect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973\ntill the year 2001. There was no statute and there was\nno ancient common law. But what -- what was it? If I\nasked you the question, what was the law in Michigan on\ndiminished capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you\nrespond?\nMR. BURSCH: It -- it changed one time. In\n1973, there was a Michigan Court of Appeals decision\nthat recognized as a matter of common law the diminished\ncapacity defense, but that was set aside by the 1975\nstatute which established all the comprehensive\ndiminished capacity defenses available, and left out\ndiminished capacity.\nSo in 1975, 1976, you know, 1978 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how was the\nMichigan Court of Appeals construing the defense? Did\nit say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, what the Michigan Court\nof Appeals did beginning in 1978 in the Mangiapane case\nwas to ask, is diminished capacity part of the statutory\ncode, and it never held expressly that it was. What it\ndid in Mangiapane and in subsequent cases, it assumed\nthat the defense existed, but it never held that. And\nthat dicta could not override the plain language of the\nstatute.\nAnd, in fact, counsel on the other side has\nnot pointed to a single Michigan decision where a\nconviction or an exoneration on acquittal, or even a\nfinding of ineffective assistance was ever based on the\ndiminished capacity defense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the 1973 case that you\nmentioned based on a statute or was it based on\nallegedly a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed\nthe court to fill? I mean, is that the way the 1973\ncase came about? And was the 1973 case followed by\nother courts, or was it just an isolated precedent?\nMR. BURSCH: The 1973 case was a common law\nvacuum, Justice Kennedy, where the Michigan legislature\nhad not yet spoken about mental incapacity defenses, and\nso it stood alone, as the court was able to do, as a\ncommon law decision. There were no other cases that\nrelied on it before the '75 statute was enacted. And\nafter that point, the Michigan appellate courts did not\nlook to the '72 decision as the source of the doctrine.\nThey assumed that if it existed, it must be somewhere\nwithin the statute.\nAnd then in Carpenter, in 2001, the Michigan\nSupreme Court, when finally the very first Michigan\ncourt to look at the question explicitly says, well,\nit's not in the statute, diminished capacity isn't\nthere. We've got mental retardation, we've got mental\nillness. No diminished capacity. As the Michigan\njudiciary, we lack the power to add the diminished\ncapacity defense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, we don't -- well, we\ndon't really have to reach this issue in this case,\naccording to your submission, but what would happen if a\nState -- an intermediate State appellate court said the\nlaw is such-and-such, and then a -- a person is tried in\nthe interim, is tried and subsequently, the State\nsupreme court says that intermediate State court\ndecision was incorrect, that never was the law of this\nState; the law was exactly the opposite.\nMR. BURSCH: I think you would apply the\nsame principles to that hypothetical as you did in\nRogers. And -- and in Rogers, you had a nearly 100-year\ncommon law history of the year and a day rule in the\nTennessee Supreme Court that the defense was available\nto use that term for nearly 100 years, and yet it didn't\nviolate due process in Rogers for the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt to abolish the rule because it was neither\nindefensible nor unexpected.\nNow, this case is much easier than Rogers or\nyour hypothetical for several reasons. First, as I\nmentioned, it's a habeas case and so we've got the layer\nof AEDPA deference that wasn't there.\nSecond, we're not talking about the\nevolution of the common law like we were in Rogers.\nWe're talking about a statute and the statute meant what\nit said in '75, just like it did in '01, just like it\ndoes today.\nAnd the last thing is that in the Rogers\ncase even the Tennessee Supreme Court acknowledged there\nwas a change. And here the Michigan Supreme Court said\nthere was no change because the statute said what it\nsaid in 1975 and that meant no diminished capacity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what I'm wondering is\nhow we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a\nState supreme court regarding the -- the law of the\nState. Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the\nlaw of the State? Isn't that what our decision in Fiore\nsays? If the State supreme court says this is the law\nand it's always been the law, then how can we\nsecond-guess that?\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Alito, I would think\nabout it in -- in two pieces. And the first piece is\ncan you second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court's\ninterpretation of the statute, and I think the answer\nthere everybody has to agree is no. The State's\ninterpretation of its own statute binds this Court,\nbinds all Federal courts, just like the South Carolina\nSupreme Court decision in -- in Bouie did.\nWith respect to the Michigan Supreme Court's\nanalysis of the retroactive effect, I agree that Fiore\nstands for that very proposition, and I think Indiana\nmakes that case very forcefully in the -- the\nmulti-State amici brief. You don't have to reach that\nquestion here, however, because given the AEDPA standard\nand the fact that the Michigan Supreme Court decision\nwas so clearly not a misapplication of Rogers and Bouie,\nit makes this a relatively easy case. But I think you'd\nbe fully within your right to follow the Fiore holding.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You -- you suggested,\nGeneral, that the -- the fact that this is statutory\nmakes your position easier.\nMR. BURSCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And I wonder if that's true.\nI mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other\nway, which suggests that we all understand that common\nlaw changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare\nfor a court to reverse a decision on what a statute\nmeans, and that that's not foreseeable in the same way.\nSo -- now, especially if it were a single court saying\nthe statute means A today, and then tomorrow it comes\nback and it says, no, it means B, whether that isn't\nactually -- whether that wouldn't cut against your\nposition.\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Kagan, I think this is\nthe easiest case, because it's not just statutory\ninterpretation; it's statutory interpretation of a\nstatute that is just plain on its face. If you had an\nambiguous statute, yes, then maybe there would be some\nmore uncertainty. But where you've got a statute that\nenumerates several defenses, does not include diminished\ncapacity, and under Michigan law it's not enumerated,\nit's not there, and the courts can't add it, that does\nmake this easier.\nI think it was probably a -- a bigger\nchallenge in Rogers, for example, to acknowledge that,\none, Tennessee law had changed right out from underneath\nthe defendant; and yet, even given that change, this\nCourt was comfortable that it was not indefensible or\nunexpected. I think when -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Counsel, what about the\nMichigan Court of Appeals? There's only one court of\nappeals, right?\nMR. BURSCH: Correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so that court several\ntimes recognized diminished capacity as a defense.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, it -- it didn't recognize\nit as a defense in the sense that it analyzed the\nstatute and said yes, the defense is available. It in\nmany instances assumed that it might exist and if it did\nthen this is the result. The closest it comes is this\nMangiapane decision in 1978, and the court says very\nspecifically there that the definition of mental illness\nin the statute, it's similar to diminished capacity, but\nthe court says at page 247 of the North West Second\nReport the court was not prepared to say they are\nidentical.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -\nMR. BURSCH: So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your colleague said that\nthere were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's\nthe court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished\ncapacity as a defense.\nMR. BURSCH: Recognizing it as a possible\ndefense. Again, in every single one of those cases, all\nof which would be contrary to the statutory language,\nincidentally, in not a single one of them did a\nconviction or an acquittal or a finding of ineffective\nassistance ever turn on that point. And so in that\nsense, it's also again very much like Rogers, where this\nCourt said that the year and a day rule had never been\nused for an acquittal or a conviction in any Tennessee\ncase.\nAnd so the question is, again through the\nAEDPA deference lens, which is very high, was the\nCarpenter decision defensible and expected? And we\nwould submit that any time that a State supreme court\napplies the plain language of the statute in accord with\nestablished principles of interpretation in that State,\nit could almost never be indefensible or unexpected.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This -- that seems a\nlittle strange for the following reason, just as I think\nthis case presents an example. You're claiming it's\nclear because the supreme court said it was clear, but\nthe court of appeals in Mangiapane, whether or not it\nassumed it or not, did an analysis that clearly says\nthat it believes that the definition of legal insanity\nincludes diminished capacity.\nIts holding didn't need that analysis,\nbecause it could have assumed it and then just said:\nBut no notice was given, so the defense fails here. It\ntook the time to analyze just this question and came to\na contrary conclusion. Its contrary conclusion was that\n\"legal insanity\" was a broad enough term under Michigan\nlaw to encompass this defense.\nThe court of -- the State supreme court has\nnow said no, it's not. But I don't know that that makes\nthe statute any less ambiguous merely because a court\nannounces that it thin ks it's not.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, two responses to that,\nJustice Sotomayor. First, I want to be again very\ncareful about what Mangiapane actually held. It did\nlook at the statutory language and at page 247 said:\n\"We are not prepared to say they are identical,\" meaning\nthe definition of mental illness and the concept of\ndiminished capacity. There the question was procedural\nbecause the defendant had not given the prosecutor\nnotice of any defense based on mental capacity in the\ntrial court, and so the court said, well, you know,\nassuming that the -- the defense exists, we are not\nprepared to decide that today -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -\nMR. BURSCH: -- because you would have to\ngive statutory notice.\nThe second -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I would have thought\nyour -- you can get to your second one, but I would have\nthought your first response to -- to the question would\nhave been to deny that you say it's clear because the\nSupreme Court of Michigan has said so. I thought your\nargument is it's clear because it's clear.\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Scalia, that was my\nsecond point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, okay. It should have\nbeen your first point. The premise is simply wrong.\nYou're saying it was clear because the statute's clear.\nMR. BURSCH: It was clear. And if any\nMichigan court had had the opportunity to actually\ndecide it on the merits in light of this 200-year\nhistory of Michigan being a criminal code State, it was\nclear. And so this is the point when a State court\ndecision is most defensible and most expected, applying\nthe plain language of a clear statute in accord with\nState principles.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any States with\na statute identical or -- or close to the Michigan\nstatute that have interpreted the statute to say it does\ninclude diminished capacity?\nMR. BURSCH: Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware\nof -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This statute is -- fairly\nwell tracks the common law tradition, which indicates\nthat diminished capacity is not a defense.\nMR. BURSCH: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just curious to know\nif any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion\nunder a statute like that.\nMR. BURSCH: I'm not aware of any other\nStates that have the same statute and have addressed the\nquestion one way or the other. I do know that the\nlanguage of the Michigan statute is fairly unique. If\nyou look in the criminal law treatises, we're kind of in\na category of only a very few States that, you know, on\nthe one hand, define mental illness and mental\nretardation, do not define or mention diminished\ncapacity, and yet still have this guilty but insane\noption, which is something that Michigan common law did\nnot have, but then that was added in the '75 statute.\nSo it's a little bit unique.\nI think it's also unique to Michigan that we\nhave this 200-year criminal code history, which if\nyou're interested you can read all about it in the In Re\nLamphere case that we cite on page 4 to 5 of our reply\nbrief. But it's when you put those things together that\nreally make this such an easy case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General, I guess I\nwonder whether it's relevant what the statute really\nsays as opposed to what courts said it says. I mean,\nsometimes judges make errors and our law is dotted with\nplaces where courts have made errors and said that\nthings mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they\ndo mean, and, you know, we expect people to follow what\nthe court says is the law even if there's really a\nbetter reading out there.\nAnd also, we think that people should rely\non what the court says is the law, even though there's\nreally a better reading out there.\nAnd so, you know, what does it matter if we\ncome out and said -- and say, you know, what were these\ncrazy Michigan courts doing? If that's what they were\ndoing, it seems as though people had a right to rely on\nthat.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, the expectation certainly\nis that people would rely on Michigan statutory law.\nAnd I concede that this would be a more difficult case\nif the Michigan Supreme Court in, say, 1990 had come out\nin a published opinion and and said the exact opposite\nof what it said in 2001. Obviously, that's not what\nhappened here.\nBut -- but ultimately, you know, the\nquestion that would have been on Mr. Lancaster's mind\nback in 1993 when he shot and killed Toni King was, does\nMichigan law prohibit me, will it punish me if I -- I\nkill someone? And -- and clearly, he had to know that.\nAnd if he had looked at the 1975 statute, he would have\nseen that diminished capacity was not mentioned there.\nSo to the extent that he -- he wanted to rely on that\ndefense, he wouldn't have found it in Michigan's\ncodified law.\nNow, I know the argument on the other side\nis, well, we have these other cases which, you know,\nmention the doctrine, kind of assume without deciding\nthat -- that it's out there. And he wants to assume\nthat he has all the knowledge of that, but not the\nknowledge of the background principle that Michigan\nwon't add affirmative defenses to a statute through a\njudicial action.\nAnd if you're going to impute any knowledge\nto him, and -- and we submit that you probably\nshouldn't, then you've got to impute all the knowledge\nof Michigan law, the plain language of the statute and\nthe interpretive principles that should guide what that\nstatute means.\nHe knew that killing someone was wrong.\nUnquestionably, he was on fair notice of that. And -\nand just like in Rogers, this diminished capacity\ndefense after 1975 was never relied on by any Michigan\ncourt to either hold someone guilty or to acquit them or\nto find that there was ineffective assistance. It just\nwas not the kind of well- established principle that\ncould possibly make the Carpenter decision either\nindefensible or unexpected.\nAnd then when you layer that on top with\nAEDPA deference, you know, really, this is about as\nsimple as it gets. There is no decision of -- of this\nCourt, not Rogers, not Bouie, not Fiore, not Bunkley,\nany Court decision that is contrary to or misapplied in\nthis Michigan Court of Appeals opinion.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI'll reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Mogill.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. MOGILL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MOGILL: Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse\nme -- and may it please the Court:\nAt the time of his offense in this matter,\nRespondent had a well-established uncontested right to\npresent evidence of diminished capacity in order to\nnegate the elements of premeditation and deliberation in\nthe first-degree murder charge against him, and he did\nassert that defense at his first trial. That trial was\nrendered unfair by the prosecutor's Batson error.\nRespondent was not allowed to present the\nsame defense at his retrial, however, because 8 years\nafter his offense, the Michigan Supreme Court\nunexpectedly changed the rules in midstream, holding in\nCarpenter that a statute that had been enacted 26 years\nbefore and that did not use the words \"diminished\ncapacity,\" did not express an intent to abolish any\ndefense of diminished capacity, but the Supreme Court\nheld that it had been abolished.\nThat was fundamentally unfair to Respondent,\nall the more so, because if the Michigan courts had\nruled correctly on the Batson issue, retrial would have\noccurred before 2001, and there's no question but that\nRespondent would have been able to raise the diminished\ncapacity as -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He would have been able to\nraise it. There's a lot of question about whether it\nwould have been successful, because if it had gone up to\nthe Michigan Supreme Court -- the statute was in effect\nduring his first trial?\nMR. MOGILL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He could have raised it,\nbut if it went up to the Michigan Supreme Court, it\nwould have had the same result as here.\nMR. MOGILL: With all due respect -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And your only -- your only\ndefense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise. But\nI don't see how it's a surprise if the Michigan law has\nbeen, as -- as the Solicitor General of Michigan has\ndescribed it, that -- that there's a clear tradition.\nIf -- if the statute addresses the area, the courts will\nnot -- will not supplement it by -- by common law\nadditions. Did he not know that?\nMR. MOGILL: With all due respect to\nopposing counsel, I -- the view -- our view of the law\nis -- is entirely different. Michigan recognizes the\ncommon law in its Constitution. Michigan law has -- was\nfirmly established that the diminished capacity defense\nexisted. By 1973 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say it was\nfirmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion\nby the solicitor general that there is no case which -\nwhich acknowledged and held the defense of diminished\ncapacity?\nMR. MOGILL: I disagree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that wrong?\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what case -\nMR. MOGILL: Well, first of all -- I'm\nsorry, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- lets the defendant off\non the basis of diminished capacity?\nMR. MOGILL: The -- let somebody off? Well,\nfirst of all, we're not talking about -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What case has a holding, a\nholding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or\nmitigates the crime.\nMR. MOGILL: Mitigates. Justice Scalia, in\nLynch itself in 1973, Ms. Lynch was charged with\nfirst-degree murder for the starvation -- in relation to\nthe starvation death of her infant. The trial judge\ndeclined to permit -- declined to permit her to offer\npsychiatric testimony to mitigate to second degree. The\ncourt of appeals reversed, indicating that evidence,\nmental health evidence of the kind she wanted to offer,\nwas admissible to establish diminished capacity, that\nis, to negate the element of premeditation and\ndeliberation.\nOnce that case was decided, there is one\ndirection only in Michigan law from 1973 until Carpenter\nby surprise in 2001. Yes, the statute was passed in\n1975, and just 3 years later in 1978, Mangiapane decided\nthat diminished capacity comes within the definition of\nlegal insanity. The phrasing in the -- in the court's\nopinion is very significant and it's much more than\nopposing counsel suggests. The court stated explicitly:\n\"We find that the -- the defense known as diminished\ncapacity is codified within the definition of legal\ninsanity.\"\nOnce that happened, then that required an\naccused who wanted to raise a diminished capacity\npartial defense to comply with the procedural\nrequirements of the new statute. From that point\nforward, it was clear that diminished capacity -- and -\nand these are published court of appeals decisions, so\nthey are binding precedent statewide in Michigan unless\nor until reversed or modified by the State supreme\ncourt, the legislature, or a constitutional amendment.\nOnce that happened, there is not a case,\nincluding in Carpenter itself, where the prosecution\nobjected to the admissibility of diminished capacity\nevidence. It was so well-established, it was beyond\nquestion. It was so well -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the question that\nwas asked was, as a bottom line at the end of the day -\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- did anybody get\nsentenced less? Did it affect the outcome? You gave a\ncase where a defendant was allowed to raise diminished\ncapacity, but was -- are there cases where the defense\nwas successful on the merits?\nMR. MOGILL: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat's a very important question. The -- the closest I\ncan come, the first part of my answer is in the Griffin\ncase in 1989, in an order which was a dispositive order\nand therefore was precedent, the Michigan Supreme Court\ndisposed of an application for leave to appeal by\nvacating and remanding a case for an ineffective\nassistance hearing because of defense counsel's failure,\ninter alia, to consider a diminished capacity defense.\nThat order could not have occurred unless\nthe supreme court had determined that diminished\ncapacity was a valid defense. The second part -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- is that correct?\nWouldn't -- wouldn't the supreme court have done that if\nit -- if it thought that at least -- at least it was\narguable?\nMR. MOGILL: I -- I respectfully submit that\nunder Strickland analysis, no. If it -- if it's not an\nestablished defense, if it's not something that would\narguably come within the Strickland framework, there\nwould not have been a remand. That would have been a -\na question of a lawyer trying to be creative, but it\nwouldn't implicate Strickland principles.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm a little\nsurprised at your answer and Justice Scalia's question\nindicates the same. If the law was as well settled as\nyou say it was in the appellate courts, then it seems to\nme certainly counsel should raise it and is arguably\ndeficient for not doing so. Whether or not he'll\nprevail at the end of the day is something quite\ndifferent.\nMR. MOGILL: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\nbelieve that the basis for a remand in a case like this,\nand this is not an unusual kind of a situation in\npractice, is where the law is clear, then the remand is\nto determine the factual basis for the defendant's\nclaim, were the facts such that a reasonably competent\nattorney should have been expected to investigate and -\nand raise it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said your view\nof the law was, you know, so well-established -\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as to be beyond\nquestion. That is the standard under AEDPA, right?\nMR. MOGILL: Well -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to be -\nyou have to be -- you have to be that right to prevail,\nright?\nMR. MOGILL: What I have to establish is\nthat the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals here\nwas objectively unreasonable. And whether it's beyond\nquestion, I think we certainly have objectively\nunreasonable ruling for the reasons that it was\nwithout -- not only was it well-established -- and I\nwant to weave into this the second part of what I'd like\nto answer of Justice Ginsburg's question. I think it's\nvery important in understanding the question of\nreversals or not what the lay of the land was, because\nwhere you have a framework that allows a defense to be\nraised and prosecutors aren't objecting, the -- the\napplication's going to be a factual matter for a jury to\ndecide.\nSo it's not going to be something that's\ngoing to percolate up into appellate legal issues. It's\ngoing to be successful sometimes, it's not going to be\nsuccessful sometimes, and there are no statistics on\nthat. But it doesn't -- it won't present a legal issue,\nand that's in no small part why the question of, well,\nwhat about a reversal -\nJUSTICE ALITO: In Griffin -- you describe\nGriffin in your brief as follows: \"The court vacated,\nreversed, and remanded the decision below based on,\nquote, \"defendant's claim that trial counsel was\nineffective for failing to explore defenses of\ndiminished capacity and insanity.\"\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: \"And insanity.\" So it\nwasn't specifically -- wasn't limited to diminished\ncapacity.\nMR. MOGILL: And that's why in my -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It was insanity in general.\nMR. MOGILL: No, it was both. The -- the\ninsanity defense is separate from diminished capacity,\nwhich is a partial defense; in fact, in Respondent's\nfirst trial, prior counsel had raised both. At retrial\nI only wished to raise the diminished capacity defense.\nThe law recognizes the difference between\nthe two in Michigan. Had diminished capacity not been a\nrecognized defense, the court's order, I respectfully\nsubmit, would have been worded just with respect to\ninsanity. There would have been no legal basis for\narguing -- or, excuse me, for including the -- the\nreference to diminished capacity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mogill, as -- as I\nunderstand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to\nshow that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you\nsay it was; but it has to have been -\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what you say it was.\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it -- there was an\nevulsive change by the supreme court.\nMR. MOGILL: I agree with that,\nJustice Scalia. And I think that's what we have. We\nhave, from -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's hard to\nbelieve that, given -- given the clear text of the\nstatute.\nMR. MOGILL: The problem, I -- I\nrespectfully submit, is that nobody in Michigan until\nCarpenter -- and -- and I -- it -- that sounds like an\nextreme statement, but again the record is clear.\nProsecutor's weren't objecting. There is a State bar\ncommittee on criminal jury instructions whose\nresponsibility it is to come up with standard jury\ninstructions on areas of law that are agreed upon and -\nand routinely enough raised in court to warrant a\nstandard instruction. That committee is comprised of\njudges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. In 1989,\nthat committee promulgated a diminished capacity\ninstruction. That's how well established it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if a prosecutor\nraised that objection knowing that the court of appeals\nwould -- would reverse the exclusion, right -- I mean,\nit's clear what the court of appeals would have done,\nright?\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And once the court of\nappeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with\nthat error, could -- could the defendant be retried?\nMR. MOGILL: The -- what would happen -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because he's -- he's\nconvicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's -\nMR. MOGILL: Convicted, convicted of second\ninstead of first; could he be tried on first?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. MOGILL: No. But that's the question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could he be retried?\nMR. MOGILL: On first, no. But -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then you\nwould be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor.\nMR. MOGILL: No. What I -- but I --\nJustice Scalia, the answer to your question is -- is\nencompassed by the statutory scheme which requires\nadvanced notice. The -- a defendant can't offer\ndiminished capacity evidence in the middle of trial. A\ndefendant has to give 30 days or whatever other time set\nby the judge notice, or it had to at the time. If the\nprosecutor, in any case, believed that such evidence\nwasn't admissible, the prosecutor had plenty of time\nprior to trial to seek an in limine ruling from the\ntrial court, to seek an interlocutory appeal from the\nMichigan Court of Appeals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He could get an -- an\ninterlocutory appeal on that?\nMR. MOGILL: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. MOGILL: And -- and I will tell you the\nprosecutors in Michigan are aggressive in -- in seeking\ninterlocutory appeals.\nWe have -- again, it is so well established,\nthere is not a contrary decision, there is not a\nquestion raised in any opinion or any decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How many holdings are\nthere?\nMR. MOGILL: There are many mentions with\nthe -- the holdings -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it the answer is\nzero, right? I mean, I -\nMR. MOGILL: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I looked at your brief\nand then I looked at their brief and they say the answer\nis zero.\nMR. MOGILL: Lynch is a holding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the holding is\nthat -- the pure holding would be if the trial court\njudge says no, you cannot raise it. Okay? The\ndefendant is convicted and appeals.\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then he says to the\nappellate court: They wouldn't let me raise it.\nAnd the appellate court says: You have a\nright to raise it.\nMR. MOGILL: And that's exactly Lynch,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is Lynch. And Lynch\nis what year?\nMR. MOGILL: 1973.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In 1973. Okay. So we have\none.\nMR. MOGILL: And -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and was there any\nother case in 1973 -- this is 10 years before. Was\nthere any other case in which the same pattern of facts\nand they said the same thing as Lynch?\nMR. MOGILL: I -- I'm not aware -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but we -- we have Lynch\non one side. Is there any case -- this is an\nintermediate appeals court -- is there any case in which\nthe defendant says, I would like to raise it, the\njudge says no, convicted, appeal, and the intermediate\ncourt of appeals says: Defendant, you are wrong?\nMR. MOGILL: The answer to your question,\nJustice Breyer, is there is no such case. And the\nreason -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And so all this\nperiod from 1973 until 1995 or whatever -\nMR. MOGILL: '93 was the offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Carpenter.\nMR. MOGILL: No, 2001 was Carpenter -\nJUSTICE BREYER: 2001. All right.\nMR. MOGILL: The offense was '93.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is exactly one case\non point which does favor you, and there are zero cases\nthat favor them; is that right?\nMR. MOGILL: If you talk holding only and if\nyou discount Mangiapane.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, Mangiapane was a -- a\nlot of words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that\nright?\nMR. MOGILL: The holding was he didn't -\nbut there was no reason for the court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. MOGILL: -- to reach that\nquestion unless diminished capacity exists.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we've got one.\nThat's -- I'm trying to find out what the state of the\nart.\nMR. MOGILL: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The state of the art is one\nfor you, zero for them.\nMR. MOGILL: If I can supplement that,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. MOGILL: One of the things -- one of the\npoints this Court looked to in Rogers was how many times\nthe year-and-a-day rule had been \"mentioned,\" and\nthat -- this is -- that's this Court's word -- in\nTennessee decisions. And so one of the things we did,\nand that's the addendum in our red brief, is look at how\nmany times there are mentions -- all of which are\nfavorable, not one of which raises even a question, of\ndiminished capacity in Michigan. And that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that -- how often was\nit mentioned in intermediate court opinions?\nMR. MOGILL: We have 4 mentions in the\nMichigan Supreme Court and 33 in the Michigan Court of\nAppeals between 1975 and 1993, and we have over 100 -\nabout 100 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Four mentions in the\nsupreme court that say what?\nMR. MOGILL: Well, Griffin is one of them.\nAnd then you have -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever held that a\nState law has been determined to be X simply because\nintermediate State courts have uniformly held it to be\nX? Never mind assumed it to be X; have held it to be X?\nMR. MOGILL: I don't know of a particular\ncase.\nBut to answer your question, Justice Scalia,\nthe law in Michigan is clear, as stated by the Michigan\nSupreme Court, that a published court of appeals\ndecision is precedentially binding statewide unless and\nuntil reversed by the Supreme Court. So the fact\nthat -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't mean it's right.\nMR. MOGILL: No. But in terms of it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to show it's\nright.\nMR. MOGILL: No, I have to show that it is\nthe law of the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That it's the law.\nMR. MOGILL: I have to show that it is the\nlaw of the State. And it was the law of the State from\n1973 forward.\nAnd I would like to supplement that, if I\nmight.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -- I'm\nsorry. Go ahead.\nMR. MOGILL: When -- when Lynch was decided,\nit wasn't acting on something new. The court of appeals\nopinion indicates that what we're doing is nothing novel\nbecause the diminished -- the right to present\ndiminished capacity evidence to rebut an -- the elements\nof premeditation and deliberation, grows out of a\n100-year history in Michigan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the\nLynch -- the Lynch case was 2 years before the Michigan\nlegislature adopted -\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the statute that\nwe are dealing with here, right?\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's where you\nare putting, if not all of your eggs, most of your eggs,\nright?\nMR. MOGILL: No, I'm -- that -- that is -\nthat's an egg, and I think I've got a pretty full\nbasket.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the -\nthat's the whole case. The whole -- the whole point is\nthat the law made that moot because the law under\nMichigan did not specify diminished capacity and it's a\ncode State, so you only get what they specified.\nMR. MOGILL: I disagree with that statement\nby brother counsel. The -- and that's why I quoted\nArticle 3, Section 7.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you'll at\nleast -- well, maybe not. I mean, would -- would you\nacknowledge that the force of Lynch was arguably\ndiminished by the fact that Michigan passed a statute\nthat did not mention the diminished capacity defense 2\nyears after it?\nMR. MOGILL: I would if the facts of the\nsubsequent litigation supported that interpretation of\nthe statute. To the contrary, every case -- Mangiapane\nwasn't -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about\nLynch.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There were no others, and\nnow I've reduced your one to nothing to like .01 to\nnothing, because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Chief\nJustice just pointed out, and now you've already said\nthere were no other cases.\nMR. MOGILL: No other holdings. But we have\nmany, many mentions, we have on-the-ground consistent\nreliance by prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's your\nwhole point, isn't it?\nMR. MOGILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't prove a\nnegative, because if everybody accepts after Mangiapane\nthat the defense exists then trial courts are not going\nto be excluding it on the basis that the statute\nexcludes it.\nMR. MOGILL: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the whole point\nyou are making.\nMR. MOGILL: And which gets me to -- to\nRogers, and -- and we turn to the questions of\nfundamental fairness.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any -- is\nthere any evidence of a trial court holding an\nexclusion?\nMR. MOGILL: There is nothing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or even suggesting one?\nMR. MOGILL: It -- it is so extreme, Justice\nSotomayor, that even in Carpenter itself, the\nprosecution did not contest the admissibility of\ndiminished capacity evidence as a trial court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's because -\neverybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you\non this anyway. I agree the bar puts it in the\ninstructions, and if the bar puts it in the\ninstructions, people tend to follow it. That's true.\nSo it's not surprising that a lot of people tend to\nfollow it.\nBut as far as court decisions are concerned,\nwe have no -- what I'm trying to think of is a\npre-statute. I give you a little credit on that.\nThat's Lynch. Pre-statute, and we have what I might\nsort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner.\nWe've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong, and -\nand here, even though there are judicial mentioners,\nthey get something. I don't know how much in the scale\nto -- to give them.\nMR. MOGILL: Well, with all due respect, the\nstandard that this Court set in Rogers is whether the -\nthe decision of Carpenter, in this case, would have been\nunforeseeable and indefensible by reference to the law\nas previously expressed so that it could be applied\nretroactively.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you think of a Federal\ncase where -- I see what we have. I'm now adding up the\nsomething for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is\na -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that\nsome courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to\nfollow it and there were others that mentioned it\nfavorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.\nMR. MOGILL: No, the Michigan Supreme Court\ndid mention it favorably as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So -- so we've got\nthat. Now, actually, that Kentucky case, was it?\nTennessee?\nMR. MOGILL: Rogers?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, Rogers. That went\nagainst you.\nMR. MOGILL: I think the principle that the\nCourt established there was very much -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But can you\nthink of any Federal precedent on this issue that's come\neven close to that being sufficient? What's your best?\nMR. MOGILL: I think the closest point, and\nit's important, and it goes, Justice Scalia, to respond\nto your point about lower court -- reliance on lower\ncourt opinions, is in Lanier, when the question\nconcerned what's the scope of the statute that's at\nissue here. And this Court very explicitly stated that\nits permissible for the world outside of court to look\nat lower court decisions, court of appeals decisions, in\nterms of what had been reasonably expressed. That's\nconsistent -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you -- if you prevail\nhere, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme\ncourts. State supreme courts, much like us, they wait\nuntil courts of appeals have issued their opinions.\nThey wait to see how the practical application of those\nworks insofar as of the fairness of the trial. They\nwait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then\nthey -- and then they take the case.\nIf you prevail, State supreme courts are -\nare going to say, you know, if we don't take this case,\neven if though it's -- does not present the issue as\nclearly as some other case might, we don't rush in, then\nwe're going to be foreclosed. I think you're proposing\na -- a dynamic which makes the Federal courts intrude on\nthe way in which State courts choose to develop their\nlaw.\nMR. MOGILL: Justice Kennedy, thank you for\nthat question, but I respectfully disagree. The relief\nwe are requesting here is simply that while the Michigan\nSupreme Court was entirely free to interpret this\nstatute any way it wanted to prospectively, so long as\nit didn't conflict with some other decision of this\nCourt, the question is: What about applying it\nretroactively? And this Court in Bouie and Rogers has\nset out clear principles for when a court that wants to\nreverse ground can do that or not, consistent with\nfundamental fairness, principles of notice,\nforeseeability, et cetera, all of which go in our\ndirection here.\nAn -- an interesting contrast, and I think a\nuseful contrast -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the\nunfairness -\nMR. MOGILL: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the unfairness here?\nDo you think there's a reliance?\nMR. MOGILL: There's not a reliance, nor is\nthat an element -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- so what is\nthe unfairness here?\nMR. MOGILL: In both -- in both Bouie and\nRogers, this Court made it clear that reliance is not an\nissue. The unfairness, and that's a very important\npoint, Justice Alito, is that by eliminating the right\nto present this category of evidence, the mental health\nevidence that would show, if accepted by a jury, that\nthe Respondent was guilty of second-degree murder\ninstead of first-degree murder, what the court was doing\nwas expanding the -- the scope of premeditation and\ndeliberation; they were aggravating the offense. That\nis a fundamental unfairness.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- the case\nis -- is very different from Bouie which you -- which\nyou rely on. In -- in Bouie, it was the question of a\nrule that is governing conduct. People come on to\npremises; they have no reason to think that they are\ncommitting an offense if they don't leave when somebody\nasks them to if they came onto the premise lawfully. So\nwhat the Court said in Bouie was that this is a\nregulation of primary conduct, and at the time these\npeople acted, they had no reason to believe that what\nthey did was unlawful. That's quite a different -\nMR. MOGILL: Yeah, I agree with that,\nJustice Ginsburg, except that at footnote 5 in Bouie,\nthis Court explicitly rejected the notion that\nsubjective reliance by the accused is -- is even an\naspect of the test for determining -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it isn't subjective\nreliance, it's -- it's what was the law.\nMR. MOGILL: And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Court said that the\nState supreme court interpretation of the statute was\nquite a surprise.\nMR. MOGILL: Yes. And what the Court did in\nboth Bouie and in Rogers was look at the underlying\nState law. In Bouie, the Court looked at the history of\nSouth Carolina law regarding trespass and found that\nuntil a year and a half later, it hadn't been construed\nto apply to a failure to leave as opposed to an entry.\nIn Rogers, the Court surveyed the very -- a very sparse\nTennessee authority on the year and a day rule.\nThat same analysis here will -- must lead to\na conclusion that all of the law in Michigan -- and\nagain, there are minimal holdings for the reasons\nJustice Sotomayor indicated -- the minimal holdings, but\nall the mentions and the holding go in the direction of\nthis existed. It was relied on, it wasn't contested -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I -- I don't see how the\nquestion can be whether there was a change in Michigan\nlaw, because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme\nCourt about what Michigan law was. Michigan law is\nwhatever the State supreme court says it was. We might\nagree, we might disagree. So I think we have to start\nfrom the proposition that the law didn't change, because\nthat's what the Michigan Supreme Court said.\nSo there must be some other ex post facto\nprinciple that applies when there's a certain type of\nunfairness. And I wonder if you could articulate what\nthat principle is.\nMR. MOGILL: I would be happy to,\nJustice Alito, but first I want to address your point\nabout having to rely on Michigan Supreme Court's\ndetermination of Michigan law, because this Court has\nmade it very clear that you can't let a State court\nrelabel something in a way that avoids Federal\nconstitutional review. Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke to\nthat point in Collins v. Youngblood. Justice Kennedy,\nyou spoke to that in your dissent in Clark.\nJustice Scalia, in your dissent in Rogers, you spoke to\nthe point, I think, in an apt phrasing, that this Court\nwill rely on a State court's reasonable determination of\nState law. I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So two -- two\ndissents is what you're relying on?\nMR. MOGILL: I'm sorry? No. The majority\n-- the opinion of the Court in Collins, but it's also a\nwell-established principle, and I also wanted to note\nthat the two other mentions, but it's not a principle\nthat's been in dispute. The -- the Court's analysis in\nboth Bouie and Rogers also supports what I'm saying,\nbecause the Court independently looked at South Carolina\nlaw in Bouie. The Court independently looked at\nTennessee law in Rogers and -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think you're -- what\nyou're arguing is that under certain -- in evaluating\ncertain constitutional claims, the -- the question of\nwhat State law is is not dispositive. I don't think\nyou're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell\na State court what State law is.\nMR. MOGILL: This Court certainly does not\nhave a right to tell the Michigan Supreme Court going\nforward what State law is with respect to diminished\ncapacity. But -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean, suppose this\nwere a diversity case. Can -- can a Federal court say,\nyou know, we -- we think that the -- the decisions of\nthe intermediate State supreme court were correct and\nthis new decision by the State supreme court is\nincorrect, so we're not going to follow that?\nMR. MOGILL: No. But this is not -- that's\nnot this case. This case involves reliance -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not -- it's not this\ncase, because there, you're trying to figure out what\nState law is. Here you're applying a constitutional\nprinciple.\nMR. MOGILL: We're trying -- we're applying\na constitutional principle -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what is that -- that gets\nme to the second part of my question.\nMR. MOGILL: Yes, exactly.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- the\nconstitutional principle that doesn't depend on what\nState law was?\nMR. MOGILL: The constitutional principle is\nthat Respondent had a right to present a defense that\nexisted at the time of his offense, unless it was\nclearly unforeseeable -- excuse me -- unless it was\nunforeseeable and -- and indefensible by reference to\nlaw that had been expressed prior to the time of the\nconduct, that that law might change, which we don't have\nhere.\nAnd Justice Breyer, I think that the\nphrasing also goes to respond to your question. The -\nthe formulation in -- in Rogers that confines looking to\nthe law as of the time that the conduct occurred, and -\nand even if you go forward, there was nothing to suggest\nan alternate interpretation of the statute, a\nquestioning opinion, nothing that would suggest that the\nlaw in Michigan was about to change.\nWe also have the fact that, unlike the\nyear-and-a-day rule, diminished capacity as -- as a\ndoctrine is well-supported and increasingly supported by\nmedical and mental health evidence. It's the -- the\nexact opposite of the year-and-a-day rule in that\nregard.\nIt also furthers -\nJUSTICE ALITO: This is -- this is the due\nprocess issue, right?\nMR. MOGILL: It's -- that's exactly -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So why is it unfair? Why is\nthere an entitlement under due process to assert what\nappears under the law of the State's intermediate court\ndecisions to be a valid defense, but is later determined\nnever to have been or not to have been at the time a\nvalid defense?\nWhat is the unfairness involved there?\nMR. MOGILL: The unfairness is because it\nwas sufficiently well-established, it was thoroughly\nwell-established as a matter of Michigan law, so\nRespondent and everybody else in Michigan had a right to\nrely on it. In fact, if this Court were to reverse the\nSixth Circuit, Respondent would be the only person in\nMichigan charged with a crime prior to Carpenter who\nwould not be allowed to present a diminished capacity\ndefense at a fair trial. That's how extreme the\nviolation was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The alternative is you are\ngoing to allow the bar associations, helpful as they\nare, by writing instructions to determine issues that\ncourts themselves have never determined, or at least not\nauthoritative supreme courts. And that's a worrying\nmatter where you are trying to create coherent systems\nof law.\nMR. MOGILL: If I can briefly -- quickly\nrespond, Justice Breyer, the -- I disagree that we're -\nthat I'm in any way suggesting turning anything over to\nthe Bar Association. The fact of that instruction is I\nthink strong evidence of the reasonableness of reliance\nof the bench and bar in Michigan, but not looking to\nturn authority over to anybody.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. MOGILL: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bursch, you have\n13 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI -- I think we actually have a lot of areas\nof agreement after 45 minutes of oral argument.\nNumber one, Justice Breyer, is that there\nreally is only one case in Michigan that reaches the\nholding that Mr. Carpenter would like that you can\nassert this defense, and that was the Lynch case in\n1973, which preceded the 1975 statute.\nSo under well-established Michigan law,\nagain, you know, In re Lamphier, Reese, which was their\n2012 decision reapplying In re Lamphier, that code\noccupies the field, and at that point, the common law\ndecision no longer existed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think he contested that.\nI think he never went further into it, but he seemed to\ndisagree with the proposition that where there is a\nMichigan statute it can't be supplemented by the common\nlaw.\nMR. BURSCH: I did not hear him say that.\nAnd if you go back and you read Reese and In re\nLamphier, I don't know how anyone could possibly\ndisagree with that. There are certainly areas -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I hate just to\ninterrupt you.\nMR. BURSCH: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He did challenge my\npremise when I presented that to him.\nMR. BURSCH: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I do think he\ndisagrees with it.\nMR. BURSCH: Well, then I disagree with\nthat. If you look at In re Lamphier and Reese, it's\nwell-settled in Michigan that when the Michigan\nlegislature speaks to a particular subject matter in\ncriminal law that the code controls and the common law\ncannot supplement it.\nThe words of the Michigan Supreme Court in\nReese itself were: \"The courts have no power to add an\naffirmative defense that the legislature did not\ncreate.\"\nAnd -- and I really don't think there can be\na dispute about that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this -- is this a one\nof a kind, in that, whatever the law was, it's clear\nfrom 2001 on? Are -- are there any other people who\nwere similarly situated, who committed a crime before\n2001 but were tried after?\nMR. BURSCH: I'm -- I'm not aware of any,\nJustice Ginsburg, and -- and the reason for that -- that\nquirk is because his habeas process by coincidence\nhappened to take such a long time. It's pretty rare\nthat we're up here on a case where the murder actually\ntook place 20 years ago and the trial is shortly after\nthat.\nBut -- but quirks in how long litigation\nhappens don't determine whether the people get the\nbenefit of changes in law or not. What matters is the\nstandard that this Court applied in Rogers and Bouie,\nwas the change -- if there was a change -- indefensible\nand not expected.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But was there anyone prior\nto 2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was\nprecluded from doing so because a court thought, oh, you\nknow, the -- the statute really clears the field, and -\nand this defense is not available?\nWas it -- can you point to anything?\nMR. BURSCH: We can't point to anything,\njust like they can't point to anything.\nYou've got a -- you know, in 1975 -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess they can point to\njust a lot of people who were raising this defense.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. And they can point to\ncases that assume without deciding that the defense\nmight exist. And then it wasn't until 2001, when the\nMichigan Supreme Court became the first Michigan court\nto look at it -- and I forget now who mentioned this; I\nthink it was Justice Kennedy -- that the Michigan\nSupreme Court did what this Court often does: It waited\nfor the right case to present itself. And when it did,\nit applied the plain statutory language in accordance\nwith Michigan interpretive law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why was it -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: This is -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why was it the right\ncase? The parties didn't even raise it, did they?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, you know, it could be\nbecause the Michigan Supreme Court thought, you know,\nthere's enough confusion, because of the mentions in the\nlower court, that it's time that -- that we address\nthis.\nI don't know why the Michigan Supreme Court\ntook it up in Carpenter. What I do know is that\nfair-minded jurists, which is the habeas standard, could\nagree that Carpenter was neither indefensible nor\nunexpected. And, you know, it's not a head-counting\nbusiness, but I would note that the Michigan Court of\nAppeals here was unanimous.\nPreviously, the Michigan Court of Appeals in\nTalton, decided the year after Carpenter, reached the\nexact same conclusion with respect to the due process\nquestion. So we've got six Michigan appellate judges\nlooking at this.\nYou know, going back to -- to what the\nMichigan law said, I -- I also heard my friend mention\nthe Griffin case. This is the three-paragraph order\nwhere they -- they remand for ineffective assistance.\nWell, Griffin is one of the cases that the\nMichigan Supreme Court discusses in Carpenter, and in\nthe very next sentence, the Supreme Court says:\n\"However, we have never specifically authorized the\ndefense's use in Michigan courts.\"\nYou know, it just wasn't there.\nWhat you have are these mentions, and then,\nas Justice Breyer mentioned, he's got jury instructions\nwhich are promulgated by the State bar, not the State\nsupreme court, or by any court for that matter. And\nwhat you have to ask yourself, is it objectively\nunreasonable, is it beyond any possibility of\nfair-minded disagreement that a Michigan Court of\nAppeals panel could conclude that Carpenter was both\nindefensible and unexpected.\nAnd -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any idea, a\nrough estimate, how many cases there were between, say,\n'75 and '93 where this defense was raised?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, all we have are the\nmentions in the appellate courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You do know about how many?\nAbout -\nMR. BURSCH: About 37, I believe. It was\nfour Michigan Supreme Court opinions and 33 Court of\nAppeals. So it was 37.\nNow, of those the Michigan Supreme Court\nitself said their four decisions didn't say one way or\nthe other. Of the other 33, 32 of them weren't even\nbinding in other Michigan Court of Appeals panels. As\nwe explained in our brief, the Michigan Court of Appeals\nwasn't bound to follow any panel decision prior to\nNovember 1st, 1990. So those weren't even binding on\nthe court of appeals itself.\nIf you are thinking about what's firmly\nestablished, you know, there were no roots at all to\nthese mentions. It would be like walking past your\nneighbor's yard, and if there is an oak tree there, you\nexpect it to be there the next day. You know, but if\nthere is a small weed, you expect it to be pulled up and\nrooted out.\nAnd that's exactly what happened here when\nthe Michigan Supreme Court finally addressed the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you rely on Reese as\nestablishing the principle that you cannot supplement\nthe defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012\ncase.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. I mentioned Reese\nbecause it's the most recent application. It cites In\nre Lamphier, which is an 1886 decision, which itself\nreferences the 1810 Territorial Act which abolished\ncommon law criminal principles -- if you have the\nstatute -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have something like\nin the middle?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BURSCH: There are many cases in the\nmiddle. There is at least a 1990 case, although I can't\nrecall the name. If you just key cite or shepherdize In\nre Lamphier, you -- you will find scores of cases that\nrely on this proposition.\nIt's -- it's not in dispute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Then you\nwere arguing that Lynch was wrong to begin with, because\nwhat you are arguing is that it created a common law\ndefense that the courts say you can't under Michigan\nlaw.\nMR. BURSCH: Right. Exactly. You've got\nLynch, which was the common law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, but you're\nsaying to me it was wrongly decided under this general\nMichigan -\nMR. BURSCH: Oh, no, no, no.\nTo be perfectly clear, what In re Lamphier\nand Reese and everything else say is that when the\nlegislature has spoken to a particular area, then the\ncourts cannot supplement. They had never spoken about\nmental capacity defenses prior to 1975, and so the slate\nwas free for the courts to do what they wanted.\nSo there's nothing wrong with Lynch in '73.\nThe problem is continuing to assume that there was a\ndefense that wasn't in the '75 statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you were\nrepresenting a defendant in this position, you certainly\nwould have raised the diminished capacity defense prior\nto Carpenter, wouldn't you?\nMR. BURSCH: Undoubtedly. But I don't think\nit means that fair-minded jurists could not possibly\nconclude that Carpenter was both indefensible and not\nexpected.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And if you were a\nprosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense,\nwould you have?\nMR. BURSCH: Well, I don't know. If I was a\nprosecutor, I would have looked at the plain language of\nthe statute -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have any -\nMR. BURSCH: -- and I probably would have -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- have any reason to think\nthat any prosecutor ever objected to such a defense?\nMR. BURSCH: I don't know one way or the\nother. We -- we just don't have the data for that.\nSo ultimately, what we are talking about\nhere -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you'd need a case\nin which the prosecutor was pretty, pretty clear that a\ndiminished capacity defense would prevail. Otherwise,\nit wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel,\nright?\nMR. BURSCH: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what's in the 37 cases\nthen? I -- they got up there. I assume the defendant\nmust have brought them. They must have brought them.\nHe must have wanted to -- to raise the defense and\nsomebody said no.\nMR. BURSCH: No, I don't believe that there\nwas a single case in those 37 where someone tried to\nraise the defense and the court said no. Nor was there\na case where the prosecutor said you can't raise the\ndefense and the court said yes. It was just a number of\ncases. And, you know, Mangiapane is really the paradigm\nexample.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. BURSCH: But the question was, did they\ngive notice? If the defense exists, is it part of the\nstatute? And -- and all the Michigan courts agree that\nthat has to be the case. But it's not till Carpenter\nwhere the court finally says, is it part of the statute\nand says no.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Just to go back to\nJustice Breyer's question. I mean, there may be no way\nyou can answer this, but are we talking about, you know,\ndo five people a year -- did five people a year raise\nthis or -- or 20 or 100? I mean, what kind of numbers?\nMR. BURSCH: You know, all we've got are the\nappellate decisions referencing it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right.\nMR. BURSCH: So if we've got 37 cases -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You can't really tell\nbecause nobody was objecting to anything -\nMR. BURSCH: Correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- right?\nMR. BURSCH: So you've got 37 cases over a\ncourse of 18 years, '75 to -- to '93. Now, that -- that\ntells us maybe two cases a year in a system that\nprocesses thousands of criminal cases.\nYou know, there was nothing here that would\nmake the Supreme Court's application of the plain\nlanguage so indefensible, so unexpected that no\nreasonable jurist could possibly have reached the same\nconclusion as now two unanimous Michigan Court of\nAppeals panels have.\nI wanted to touch briefly on the unfairness\npoint. And Justice Ginsburg, I -- I believe brought up\nBouie. And Bouie is really the perfect analogy,\nbecause, again, under the AEDPA standard, it's\nLancaster's burden to show that the court of appeals\ndecision here was contrary to our misapplication. And,\nto the contrary, it was the exact application of Bouie.\nIn Bouie, you had a clear statute that was\nvery narrow, and the State court expanded it in a very\nunexpected way. And this Court found that was\nindefensible and unexpected.\nThe exact opposite happened here. You had\nthe Michigan Supreme Court applying very narrow\nstatutory language exactly the way it was written in\naccord with 200 years of interpretive principles.\nSo -- so really, the problem here is not any\nunfairness, the problem is the Sixth Circuit yet again\nnot applying habeas deference under the statute or this\nCourt's precedent and disregarding another Michigan\nState court decision where reasonable jurists could have\nreached different conclusions on this.\nIt's not our burden to -- to demonstrate\nwhat the law was or wasn't. All we have to show is that\na reasonable jurist could have reached the conclusion\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals did here, and there\ndoesn't appear to be any question that's the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want us to say \"yet\nagain\" when we write our opinion?\nMR. BURSCH: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
