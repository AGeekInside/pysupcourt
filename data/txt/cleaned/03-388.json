FREDERICK: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nPesticides are economic poisons designed to kill\nliving things. Sometimes they do not work as designed.\nFor more than a century until the 1990's, courts\nroutinely permitted farmers to bring claims against\npesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by\npesticides. In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972,\nCongress did not intend to displace those preexisting\nState law remedies.\nThe farmers here allege claims for defective\ndesign, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of\nwarranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that\nseverely damaged their peanut crops. I'd like to start\nwith our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate\nfor three reasons why those claims survive preemption.\nThe defective design and manufacturing claims\nchallenge the product's composition, not its label. The\nfraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general\nlegal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the\nfailure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or\nin addition to FIFRA requirements.\nNow, with respect to the first point, Dow\nconcedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective\ndesign and manufacturing claims generally are not\npreempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as\nthis case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers\nto develop their claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't you make every\nfailure to warn claim a defective design claim? That is,\nthey didn't warn about the effects, but those effects\nwould not have been present if the product had been\ndesigned to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse\neffect on the peanut crop.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, the way the\nRestatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1\nand 2 describe, there are basically three theories that\nproducts liability claims can proceed on: a defective\ndesign, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings.\nThe restatement explains that they are distinct legal\ntheories that go to different problems that the\nmanufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A\ndefective design claim asserts that the composition was\ninadequate and that a properly designed product could have\nbeen put on the market that would not cause the harm.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Frederick, on the\ndefective design claim, presumably that's based on a\nfactual theory that Dow could have reasonably designed\nStrongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid\nsoil.\nMR. FREDERICK: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But doesn't that mean your\nclient should have to put forward some evidence\nestablishing a material issue of disputed fact on that\npoint?\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but here --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it didn't do that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well here, Your Honor, the\nmotion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based\non the merits of the claims. It was based on them being\npreempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law. They\nalso asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision.\nBut we never had discovery in this case. The\nDistrict Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered\nDow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked\nus out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance\nto prove that a safer design for the product could have\nbeen made. And that's where we think the court's decision\nbelow was overbroad and should be reversed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the problem I have with\n-- with the Government's case and with the respondent's\ncase is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice\nGinsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast\neverything as a warning.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the restatement have some\nspecific provisions that say no matter how good the\nwarning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's\na -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective\nproduct or something?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. Restatement sections 1 and\n2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if\nyou can show that the product could have been reformulated\nto be properly designed, then the existence of a warning\nthat might go to certain of its uses would not negate a\ndefective design claim. The Texas Supreme Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- even if the warning\nspecifically covered that design defect?\nMR. FREDERICK: That -- that's -- that's\ncorrect. And what the restatement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So even if this product said,\nwarning: may not be effective in high pH soils, that's\nnot good enough?\nMR. FREDERICK: Under the restatement rule,\nwhich Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've\ncited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true\nbecause the restatement explains that there are certain\nwarnings that could be ignored or not observed or not\nunderstood properly and that if it can be proved that a\nproperly designed product would be on the market, there\nare public policy reasons why that's what we want to\nencourage manufacturers to do. I mean, under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At any cost? I mean, what if\nit -- you know, yes, I can -- I can sell you stuff that\nwill -- that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to\nbe three times as effective. Do I have to sell it?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't I just sell it for those\npeople who don't need it for -- for high pH soil at a\nthird the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way,\ndon't use this in high pH soil? It's crazy to say you\ncan't do that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, to answer your\nquestion in several ways, that's a jury determination to\n-- to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design\nthat the manufacturer would be asked to -- to do or to\nmarket a separate product that was separately designed for\nhigh-acid soils.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's never a question of\nthe reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think it's a question of\nwarning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take\ntheir theory, which is that a defective design claim\nalways collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a\ndefectively designed product that admittedly causes harm,\nand all they have to do is change the label and say, if\nused in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm,\nbecause that would necessitate a change to the label --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, not necessarily. It\nwouldn't be always either way. I would think that if in\nfact you have a product and the product causes harm in a\nsubset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury\ncould decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not\nhaving designed the super-safe product or the\nunreasonableness consists of not having had a different\nlabel.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that -- there are -- that's\nwhy the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive\ntheories for defect --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you're arguing that in this\ncase you have the first.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems implausible on -- you\nknow, --\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, we have both actually.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because all they'd have to\ndo is don't use it in pH soil.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. We have defective warning\ntoo, and -- and if I can address that as well. The\nstatute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or\nmisleading statement in the label as to any particular.\nOur position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for\npeanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are\ngrown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a\nmisbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a\nfailure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of\nwarranty.\nNow, the Medtronic majority made absolutely\nclear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in\nfact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law\nclaim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the\nexistence of a State law remedy is not an additional\nrequirement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So on -- on that aspect of the\ncase, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation\nof FIFRA.\nMR. FREDERICK: We don't necessarily need to say\na violation of FIFRA is -- so long as the requirement is\nthe same, although we can certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a -- that's a bit\ndifferent. You were -- you were asserting a moment ago I\nthought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this was\na violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.\nMR. FREDERICK: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you then\nhave a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the\ntheory of your complaint.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. The theory of our complaint\nwas a failure to warn both for negligence and as a\ndefective product.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason for that, I take\nit, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agree\nFIFRA does not provide an independent private right of\naction.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you've got to sue under\nState law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam\ndunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said,\nthe failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the --\nthe warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an\ninadequate warning. That would -- that would keep you\nwithin the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit,\nand it would also make clear that you had a State law\ncause of action, not a Federal cause of action.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and that's in effect\nwhat you're arguing.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. And -- and because of the\npreliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly\nshould have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There\nare counterclaims that this is done at the motion for\ndeclaratory judgment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In your view -- in your -- your\nopinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose\nEPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they\npublish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of\ncases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we\nthink that the labeling should be thus and so and we think\nthat State tort suits will interfere with our ability to\npromote the uniform labeling and therefore they're\npreempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, it can and the -- the\ninteresting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of\ncourse EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it\nnever tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and\ncomment so that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, EPA has -- has waived\nefficacy data requirements. Right?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, is it your position that\na State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy\nclaims?\nMR. FREDERICK: They have to do it pursuant to\ntheir powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale\nor use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State\ndesignates a particular locality requirement and a special\nneed, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirements\nthat the manufacturer has to comply with.\nNow, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their\nregulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that\nStates have labeling authority. The States can impose\nlabeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you're not relying on\nthat in this cause of action.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, Justice -- no, Justice\nO'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can\naffirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their\ntheory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidental\neffect that induces a change to label is preempted. That\ntheory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit\nrelied on.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does -- does FIFRA\nrequire the manufacturer to say on the label what the item\ncan be used for?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, but I want to address --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So how -- how does an express\nwarranty claim escape preemption --\nMR. FREDERICK: As the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- where -- where Dow just\nsays the federally mandated statement is included on my\nlabel and it's true?\nMR. FREDERICK: A warranty claim, Justice\nO'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case,\nis not a requirement under State law because it's a\nvoluntary contractual arrangement between the parties.\nThe Court I think has made clear that what has to be\nascertained here is does the State cause of action or the\nState law create a requirement. That's not true in the\nwarranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements\nin -- as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in\nother ways.\nSo what Dow did here with its warranty was\ncompletely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that\nwarranty by putting on the market a product that was not\nsuitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown\nis a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook.\nBreach of that is not a requirement imposed under State\nlaw. And that has been, I think, verified by seven\nJustices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case.\nNow, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is\nimportant to understand that in both Cipollone and in a\nfootnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where\nthere are general legal duties that are not observed by\nthe manufacturer that don't go to the specific product\nitself, those claims are not preempted.\nHere our assertion is that Dow put on the market\na -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out\nand told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses.\nWe acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages.\nThose are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific\nones. And the existence of the preemption clause of\n136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try\nto prove to a court that fraud was committed here.\nNow, if I could briefly address two points. One\nis that the inducement to change theory should be\nrejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit\ndecided this case and it is an overly broad theory for\nseveral reasons.\nFirst, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b)\nwhich says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say\nrequirements that induce a change to the label. And\nthat's how many of the courts have gone off track since\nthe Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They\nhave read FIFRA as saying just because the word\nrequirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that\nimposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to\nchange the label is thereby preempted. We think that's\noverly broad because it confers way too much discretion on\nmanufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they\ncan claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy\nso long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced\nto change the label.\nBecause EPA does not evaluate the specific\ncontents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are\nmade on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly\nambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer\nhas to do under the inducement to change theory is go to\ncourt and say we would have to change the label and\nthereby 136v(b) preempts it.\nNow, I'd also like to stress that the other\nside's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your\nquestion, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not\nevaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the\nhistory behind these provisions is that EPA understood\nfrom the very beginning that common law claims would serve\nan important incidental regulatory effect.\nIf we could review the history for a moment.\nPrior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers\nhad brought claims against manufacturers for design\ndefect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law\nclaims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well\nestablished by 1972 that there was a huge section in the\nAmerican Law Reports that annotated all the cases and\nexplained what the common law duties of pesticide\nmanufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when\nCongress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages\nof hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there\nis not one mention of any effort to displace those\npreexisting common law claims.\nAnd when EPA, in discharging its\nresponsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by\nthe requirement that it re-register products that were\nalready out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's\nstandards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you\nshould waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't\ndo this. Congress responded, but importantly in the\nadministrations on both sides, EPA has always understood\nexcept until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor\nGeneral changed the position of the Government, that these\nkinds of incidental common law suits would have an\nimportant regulatory effect.\nIf we could just take the case of DDT. For 30\nyears, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages\nuntil it became clear that the groundswell over the course\nof decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only\nat the back end that the expert agency regulators\ndetermined that in fact the product needed to be banned,\nbut that was only after a very long history in which\ncommon law suits had provided remedies to farmers and\nothers who were harmed by that product.\nNow, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA\nexpanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater\nproducts than had been done in the Carter administration\nin 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing\nthat it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the\nEPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done\nis because suits can be brought against manufacturers who\nput on the market ineffective products. We cited that on\npage 31 of our brief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you take the position\nthat juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or\nare they much -- are they on a par?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, our broadest theory,\nJustice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b)\ndoesn't include common law claims at all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we disagree with that.\nMR. FREDERICK: If you disagree with that, then\nthey would have to be the same, and that's why our point\nabout the existence of the parallel requirements is the\nsame.\nI want to address the point of the discordance\nbetween what State juries can decide and what State\nregulators can decide because Dow and the Government have\nfeatured that in their case. The Government in the\nMedtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said\nthere was no problem to be had with juries rendering\nsupposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were\nfollowing one Federal standard. The Federal standard here\nis clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what\nmanufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and\nunder the regulations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their strong point.\nSo what is the response to that? Because you can easily\nget two juries in different parts of the country to decide\nabsolutely opposite things as to what the label should\nsay, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're\nin an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed\nthis statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries\nin different places.\nMR. FREDERICK: First, the juries -- unlike a --\na declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy,\nJustice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is\nnot saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm speaking practically. And\nI don't have to go into all the argument.\nMR. FREDERICK: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know the argument. It's a\nvery familiar argument.\nMR. FREDERICK: Sure. The answer is that --\nthat Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of\ndisuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very\nclear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b --\nsurround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow\nStates to depart in significant respects from what was\nnationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say\nStates can regulate sale or use and they can also impose\nextra requirements for special locations.\nNow, what Dow did here I think illustrates the\nway the system is supposed to work, which is that when a\nproblem was identified with their product in the States of\nTexas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it\npetitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label\na supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it\nis for distribution in those three States only and it\nprovided 10 important changes to the label that it\notherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how\nthe system is supposed to work. If the incidental\nregulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims\ninduces or causes some kind of change to the label, that\ncan be done without an adverse effect to national\nuniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And\nwhat Dow did here was it has its label and then it\nattaches the supplemental label that addresses the\nparticular conditions that exist in the State.\nAnd the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly\nappropriate and valid way to address the geographic,\nenvironmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the\ndifferent regions of the country that engage in\nagriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that\nif you accept the premise of the Government's argument in\nMedtronic, which is that juries can be properly\ninstructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow\nthe appropriate Federal standard.\nNow, I would like to turn -- sorry. Did you --\nno, go ahead.\nI would like to turn briefly to the -- the\nrequirements aspect of the case because we do think that,\nunder our broadest theory, this is a different situation\nthan Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important\nstatutory indications that are in the provision 136v.\nUnlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that\nis a non-preempted provision, and that is different from\nMedtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that\nallowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to\nrequirements and whether or not the States should be\ndisplaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a)\nand in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be\nimposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard\nis. That means that you have to look at requirements in a\nsomewhat different way because the States have this\nauthority that they did not have under the Medical Device\nAmendments.\nThere's a textual indicator under (b) also which\nrefers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that\nshall issue these requirements. Such -- the meaning of it\nin Webster's means what has been already described -- is\nin (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate\nregulations. So we think that there is a textual basis\nfor distinguishing the word requirements that this Court\n-- five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would\nencompass common law claims.\nIf there are no further questions at this time,\nI'd like to reserve the balance --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask one because I think\nyou'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute,\nwhich is the -- the statute sets up a perfectly good way\nof keeping this branded stuff off the market. All any\ncomplaining farmer has to do is to go to EPA and ask them\nto pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction.\nIt's like the atomic bomb on the company. And so that's\nvery strong.\nAnd the only thing that leaves out is the\npossibility of damage remedies, but if you want your\ndamage remedy, just go to EPA and tell them to give it to\nyou because they can write the rule the other way that I\nwas suggesting.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I don't think that EPA\ncould write a rule requiring damages to be done. It\ndoesn't have the statutory authority --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They would just say it doesn't\npreempt.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, there's no indication here\nthat EPA can do that kind of thing. In FIFRA, it\ncertainly doesn't have that kind of provision. I mean,\ncertainly there are different ways that the statute could\nhave been written. That isn't the choice that Congress\nmade.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress\nspecifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity,\npreempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling\ndifferent from those required under FIFRA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why doesn't the other\namendment limit your argument? Because Congress has also\npassed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses\nto get in to the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it\n-- it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doing\nso. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to\nthose subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't\nthe subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the\n-- the whole preemption claim?\nMR. WAXMAN: There are -- there are two\nfundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal\nrequirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains,\nthat a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide\nwith the precise labeling to the word and font size that\nEPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the\nwording relates to human safety, environmental protection,\nor efficacy.\nNow, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr.\nFrederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA\nto Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee\nreport plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not\nsaying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no\nlonger concerned with efficacy. What they said was\nbecause the Department of Agriculture and the extension\nservices and the State universities are all involved in\nthis and, in particular, are involved in the statutory\nrequirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for\nregistration, even submit a registration application, the\nmanufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing,\nwhich Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not monitored at\nall. The -- the manufacturer can say -- make up reports\nand EPA is never going to look at it.\nMR. WAXMAN: If the manufacturer makes up\nreports, it has committed a felony. EPA can enforce it.\nIt can refer it to the Attorney General. It's just like\nthe --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But maybe it isn't a labeling\nviolation. I mean, there are claims made here that I have\ntrouble shoehorning into your theory. For instance, why\ndoes a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its\nproduct on peanuts on acid soil impose a label\nrequirement?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I -- I just don't understand\nthat.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice O'Connor, I think -- I will\naddress the negligent testing and, of course, the design\ndefect --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- discussion that's figured so\nprominently in my colleague's argument.\nIt's very, very important to understand that\nunlike in Sprietsma and Medtronic and so many of the --\nand, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims\nin Cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we\ndidn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. We couldn't have\nwith respect to at least one of those two claims. We\nfiled a motion for summary judgment that said with respect\nto -- let me take design defect first. With respect to\ndesign defect, it is possible under Texas State law to\nstate a claim for products liability under defective\ndesign without impeaching the labeling.\nAnd there is a brief filed in this case by Dean\nPowers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the\nTexas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law,\nand he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why\nthey are all preempted and all invalid under independent\nand adequate State grounds.\nBut what we did is we didn't move to dismiss.\nWe filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion\nfor summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this\ncase to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and\nwe said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design\ndefect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think\nthat what you are complaining about does impeach the\nlabeling. Therefore, show us what you have.\nNow, under rule 56, they had two alternatives.\nThey could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule\n56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. We\ndon't know how this was tested. We don't know how this\nwas manufactured. We're entitled to discovery, and\ndistrict courts recognize that all the time. What they\ndid --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And they didn't do that?\nMR. WAXMAN: They did not do that, and what they\ndid was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence,\nincluding expert affidavits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, you said\nthey didn't file a motion to dismiss. I thought you\nbrought the lawsuit.\nMR. WAXMAN: We brought the lawsuit and we --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then they couldn't file --\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. I said we didn't file\na motion to dismiss --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You didn't file a motion to\ndismiss your own complaint?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no. Their counterclaims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nMR. WAXMAN: In other words, this wasn't decided\n-- Mr. Frederick's reply brief talks over and over and\nover again about how this was decided on the pleadings,\nand you know, there was no discovery allowed. Under rule\n56, they could have asked for discovery when we basically\nsaid, okay, let's show our hands. We got two jacks. What\ndo you got? And what their expert said and what their\nresponse said was if the 2001 amended label had been on\nit, we wouldn't have been injured.\nNow, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a\nsummary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the\nburden is on the adverse -- the adverse party must by\naffidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth\nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\ntrial, and they didn't do that.\nNow, the classic design defect -- let me -- let\nme give you an example.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's just try to boil\nit down a little bit for my purposes. Do you concede that\nthere could be a claim based on no testing --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that there could be a\nclaim based on design defect, that there could be a claim\nsaying there were off-label oral statements made that\namounted to fraud or misleading --\nMR. WAXMAN: I'll take them in your precise\norder.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.\nMR. WAXMAN: Under Texas law -- and the Court of\nAppeals opinion, the Grinnell opinion cited by the Court\nof Appeals opinion, says this, as does Dean Powers. Under\nTexas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort.\nIt is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. It is\nan element of a -- the tort -- the claim of product defect\nrelated to warnings. And so it is not possible under\nTexas law, settled Texas law. Other States are different,\nbut Texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make\nclaims of negligent testing an element of the tort of\ndefective product by failure to warn, and that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the way you proceeded in\nthis case, you made it clear that it would be impossible\nfor the Texas court itself to weigh in on this because you\njumped the gun. They wanted to proceed in Texas court,\nand then we would have known what Texas law was on these\nsubjects. You said, no, we want to be in the Federal\nforum.\nMR. WAXMAN: We want -- as the -- as the Fifth\nCircuit found and the District Court found, we filed a\ndeclaratory judgment in Texas after we received their\ndemand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in\na single forum, which the Texas venue rules would not have\nallowed, and we -- we actually filed this in Lubbock,\nTexas, which is the geographic center of where these 29\nfarmers operate.\nNow, with respect to defective design, yes,\nunder Texas law if they had a -- they have to allege and\nthey have to prove that there is a safer alternative\ndesign for this product, which they never even introduced\none quantum of evidence about. But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you're --\nyou're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than\nthe preemption issue.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, what we said was your claims\nare preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are\nrequired by Federal law to use.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But they now say they don't.\nThey ought to be able to proceed on those claims. What do\nwe do with that?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, what this -- what -- what\nhappens under rule 56 --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And also the -- also the\nclaims of false, misleading statements outside the label.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. I'm going to get to the false\nand misleading statements outside the labeling in a\nminute, but just to finish the design defect point, they\nfiled a complaint -- a counterclaim which had as a count\nthis was defectively designed. It is possible under Texas\nlaw to prove that something is defectively designed. If\nthey had come in and said, but we filed a motion for\nsummary judgment that says here's our evidence and we\ndon't think that you can satisfy -- that you are, in fact,\ncomplaining about a defective design --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if they did allege a\ndefective design claim under Texas law, would that have\nbeen preempted?\nMR. WAXMAN: No. If -- if they had said, look,\nthe problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief\nindicates, it's not a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me your argument\nis not whether there's preemption. It's whether there's a\nState cause of -- State law cause of action.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. It's -- it's both.\nWith respect to defective design, what we said is, your\nclaim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the\njury on defective design without impeaching the label. If\nwe're wrong, prove it in response to our summary judgment\nsubmission.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that their burden?\nMR. WAXMAN: It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that their burden or is your\nburden to show --\nMR. WAXMAN: It is -- it is absolutely their\nburden in -- as the responding party to a motion for\nsummary judgment, to show that there are material facts\nthat are either in dispute or there are material facts\nthat would allow them to go to the jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But on your theory there is no\nmaterial fact, it seems to me, because your -- what you\nsay they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching\nthe label.\nMR. WAXMAN: And they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Every time they sue on the --\non the ground that -- let's say, that -- that the -- the\nactual use was inconsistent with what the label described,\nyou could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have\nto change our label to say that what's on the label now is\nin fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's\nnot a -- a question of needing more fact. On your theory,\nwhenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you\nsay, your response is going to be, as a matter of law,\nwell, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else.\nThat impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.\nMR. WAXMAN: That is exactly right. What they\ncould have done in response to our motion for summary\njudgment is to say this product assertedly harms -- when\nit is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the\nproduct it is -- the plant that it's supposed to protect\nif the soil pH is too high. They could have easily have\ncome back and said if they had a -- a design defect claim\nthat didn't impeach the label to say you should have --\nthere was a way to manufacture this product. You could\nhave it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or\nif the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a\nway to design this so that it is dissolved in a more\nacidic solution.\nThe classic case, which is referenced in the\nNRDC brief, which has many, many examples of true design\ndefect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case\ninvolving rat poison. It's a case called Banks v. ICI\nAmerica. It's a Georgia Supreme Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you quite clearly have both.\nI understand that.\nLet me ask you a question about the -- the\npreemption point because what I think they're saying is go\nread the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there\nyou see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory\nrequirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims\nis we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without\nany change in the regulatory, that -- that it was\nviolated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we\nare not imposing a requirement different from or in\naddition to the requirement of Federal law. We are\nenforcing a requirement that is the same as the\nrequirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA\nwere to think that tort suits in those circumstances in\npractice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a\nregulation to that effect. But they haven't.\nNow, what -- what is the answer to that\nargument?\nMR. WAXMAN: The answer is threefold. Number\none, a challenge to a -- the wording of a statement on the\nlabel on the grounds that it is false and misleading is --\ndoes impose a requirement different than Federal law, not\nthe requirement that -- that labeling not be false and\nmisleading, but the fundamental requirement that a --\nunless and until the EPA says otherwise, the manufacturer\ncan only sell this product with the precise labeling that\nEPA has approved. And it -- if you look at page 63a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, do I --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- of the joint appendix --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, do I take it from\nwhat you have just said that there is no -- even though\nthe statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way\nthat that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is\nsomething strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute\nhas a prohibition on misbranding? I can see the argument\nthat all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says\nno misbranding. So is EPA the only the player in the\nmisbranding --\nMR. WAXMAN: Insofar as labeling is concerned,\nthe answer is yes, and that's because the statute -- the\nstatute has many, many instances in which it makes it\nclear that in service of the objective of a nationally\nuniform label, the expert agency that approves and\ndictates the language of that label be the one to decide\nwhat is or isn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- can I ask you one question\nhere?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because you were just going to\npoint out where it says that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It goes to your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which I think is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just let me ask this one\nquestion. Supposing the label says, this product contains\nvitamin A. Period. And it doesn't contain vitamin A, and\nthey prove that in court. And you say you would have to\nchange the label. I suggest you could change the product\nby putting vitamin A in it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, you can -- you're --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that an answer to\nthe misbranding? You change the product not necessarily\nthe label.\nMR. WAXMAN: Because the difference between a --\nthat would be a -- a manufacturing defect, which are cases\nthat have been decided --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be a false statement\nin the label. The label happened to be false, a\nmisrepresentation in it.\nMR. WAXMAN: If -- if the -- if it contains --\nI'm sorry. Was it vitamin A? If it contains vitamin A\nbecause that's what the manufacturer intended and that's\nwhat the manufacturer produced --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. The manufacturer knew it\ndidn't contain it. He falsely put that in the\nstatement --\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I see. Said that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and -- and it's -- it's a\nmisbranded, false statement. Now, does he have to change\nthe label or could he change the product?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I believe that you have --\nyou would have to -- I mean, would it be efficacious with\nvitamin A? I don't know, but if it -- if it requires a\nchange in the label, it has to be done by EPA because the\nmanufacturer commits a Federal law violation if it sells\nthe product with any different label. If you -- if I can\njust direct the Court's attention to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm suggesting he\ncould sell the product with the same label if he just\nchanged the product to correct the misstatement.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the test, as the Fifth\nCircuit stated, Justice Stevens, is whether a judgment\nagainst Dow -- I'm quoting. Quote: whether a judgment\nagainst Dow would cause it to need to alter the Strongarm\nlabel. I'm -- and that's the -- those are -- that's the\ntest that was applied here and is always applied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but why --\nMR. WAXMAN: That is, does the State law cause\nof action -- is it premised on a State law duty that there\n-- that different labeling be used --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but neither --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- that is, a little bit different\nthan what Federal law requires.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I think some\nof -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I\nunderstand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument\ndraws no distinction between the two following kinds of\nsituations. Situation A: there's something that the\nmanufacturer should have told you, should have put on the\nlabel, but the manufacturer didn't. Situation B: the\nmanufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is\nwrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and\nit causes harm.\nIt makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption\npurposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the\nground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the\nlabel was false, I should get damages for -- for whatever\nharm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for\npreemption purposes differently from the situation in\nwhich the -- the manufacturer made no false statement. He\nsimply should have said more. And if -- if you don't\ndistinguish between those two situations, then the -- the\nprohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing\nbecause -- because it can never be enforced, in effect,\nexcept with respect to some prospective user. It can\nnever be enforced with respect to the actual user.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Souter, that is a choice\nthat Congress could have made. It is plainly not a choice\nthat Congress did make because it applied the preemption\nprovision to requirements that are either in addition to\nor different than. And whether a label is assertedly\nmisleading because it fails to include something on the\nEPA-approved label or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Requirements for labeling or\npackaging --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that are in addition to or\ndifferent.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Requirements for labeling or\npackaging.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and -- and if it -- if the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, and the argument that's\nbeing made is that we ought to -- we ought to read -- we\nought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has\njust described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in\na relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward\nand, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the\ntwo kinds of situations.\nMR. WAXMAN: The allegation in this suit -- the\nclaims in this suit -- and I -- I see that my time has\nexpired.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nIt would entirely destroy the uniformity\ncontemplated by -- contemplated by the statute if the EPA-\napproved and mandated label were subject to jury-by-jury\ninvalidation based on a jury's determination of whether a\nlabel is false.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a new position for the\nGovernment, isn't it?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, we have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You used to take the opposite\nposition.\nMS. BLATT: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we're dealing here, as --\nnobody has mentioned it, but there -- there's a clear\nstatement rule for preemption, isn't there? Doesn't the\npreemption of -- of traditional State powers have to be\nclear in the statute?\nMS. BLATT: We -- we think subsection (b) is\nunambiguous in preempting any statement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's ambiguous enough\nthat the Government -- the -- the chief beneficiary of the\n-- of the supposed preemption didn't see it. It used to\ncome out the other way. How can you possibly say it's\nclear?\nMS. BLATT: Well, the agency is allowed to\nchange its position and we realize --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. It's -- it's\nwelcome to change it, but it -- it's one thing to change\nit. It's another thing to change it and come in to say\nthat the question is clear.\nMS. BLATT: Well, we think that -- we realize\nthat our position was inconsistent with not only the\nCourt's decision in Cipollone and in Medtronic that\nrecognizes that requirement extends to common law duties.\nBut more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the\nsame facts could come up with completely different reasons\nwhy a label is false --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if you have one\nadministration thinking the one thing and the other\nthinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the\nagency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if\nthe reg -- if the agency comes to that conclusion, let\nthem promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks\nit can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that\nreg.\nMS. BLATT: Well, unlike Medtronic where\npreemption occurred by virtue of the FDA's regulation,\nunder FIFRA there's preemption by virtue of the statute\nitself. And I just want to give one --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why isn't there a big\ndifference, for purposes of your argument, between the\nMedtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in\nthis case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do\nabsolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA\ndoes nothing on the subject of efficacy.\nMS. BLATT: Well, that's just not true, with all\ndue respect. I mean, they -- the -- we don't verify the\naccuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement,\nboth in the preemption provision and in the requirement to\nuse the EPA label, clearly extends to efficacy.\nAnd you can have disuniform context whether it's\nsafety or efficacy. Imagine a label that directs a\nproduct to be mixed for 20 minutes. One jury could find\nthe label was false because the product should have only\nbeen mixed for 10 minutes. Another jury in the same\ncourthouse could find the label was false because the\nproduct should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes.\nAnd this case is another really good example.\nNow the petitioners are saying the label says that the\nsoil only should be a 7.2 level. Their expert says --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the remedy to that\nwould not necessarily be to change the label. It might be\nto change the quality of the product that requires how\nmuch time for mixing.\nMS. BLATT: And we think it's critical that our\nposition is that this statute only operates in the area of\nlabeling, and it preempts only those State labeling\nrequirements --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you say about my\nvitamin A example?\nMS. BLATT: I think your vitamin A example is an\nexcellent example of a non-preempted claim. If a\nmanufacturer says that this is a pesticide and he puts\nClorox in the bottle, the plaintiff wants to get to the\njury on the theory that a reasonable manufacturer would\nnot have used Clorox. He would have used the pesticide.\nIf the argument, on the other hand, is Clorox was fine. I\ndon't have a problem with Clorox, I just wish I would have\nbeen given a warning, but that's not the way a plaintiff\nwould frame his complaint.\nWe think it's critical that our theory is if the\nplaintiff's theory of recovery is necessarily --\nnecessarily predicated on a requirement that the\nmanufacturer used a label different than the EPA-approved\nlabel the Federal law required it use --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's -- let's be\nspecific here. If it's a failure to test, if it's a -- a\ndesign defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, false\nmisrepresentation, why are they preempted?\nMS. BLATT: On the face of the complaint, we\nagree that they're not preempted. Our only position is by\nthe time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided\nthat they had no evidence on what would have been non-\npreempted claims. If another farmer wants to bring an\nexpert that says Strongarm can be manufactured --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then do you endorse the\ntheory of the Court of Appeals in this case?\nMS. BLATT: Well, we think the Court of Appeals\ntook it claim by claim and read the affidavit -- or at\nleast the District Court did --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you think just mere\ninducement to change a label is sufficient to create\npreemption.\nMS. BLATT: Mere inducement only to the extent\nthat that's a shorthand way of saying the label was --\nnecessarily had to be required. Let me give you an\nexample.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If Congress wanted that, surely\nit could have stated it more clearly than simply saying\nthe State shall not impose or continue in effect any\nrequirements for labeling or packaging. A tort suit\nbecause of -- of mislabeling is not a requirement for\nlabeling or packaging.\nMS. BLATT: If the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if Congress wanted to say\nthat, they could have said it.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think they did say if a\ncommon law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement\nthat the manufacturer used a different label than Federal\nlaw required him to use. In this case, the common law\nduty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer\nshould have put something on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have -- you have that\nprovision which talks about requirements for labeling or\npackaging in conjunction with another provision that\nauthorizes the State to regulate the sale or use.\nMS. BLATT: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you have to make\nsense of the two.\nMS. BLATT: Right, and that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems to me that means\nthe State can impose certain requirements upon the seller\nto the consumer --\nMS. BLATT: Not on labeling. Justice Scalia,\nevery day --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, every change -- virtually\nevery change -- virtually everyone -- if -- if you believe\nthe respondent's theory, virtually any State regulation of\nthe substance of the sale will require a change in the\nlabel.\nMS. BLATT: That's just not true. Every day\nStates and localities around the country are imposing use\nrestrictions. They tell -- they tell applicators and\nusers when and where to apply the pesticide and what types\nof --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sale -- sale or use is what it\nsays.\nMS. BLATT: That's right and they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say -- if they regulate the\nsale or use.\nMS. BLATT: That's right, and they do that every\nday without imposing labeling requirements. Imagine --\nimagine --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give me sale examples.\nMS. BLATT: They require the manufacturer, in\norder to sell the product, be registered with the State,\nand they can impose whatever sale restrictions they\nwant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And can they --\nMS. BLATT: -- that don't go to the labeling.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they do the same thing by\n-- through jury verdicts?\nMS. BLATT: Absolutely not. It would be bad\nenough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50\nStates and had each --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So now -- so now you say a\nState can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.\nMS. BLATT: No. A State absolutely cannot\nimpose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if the -- if juries\ncan do anything that the -- are -- are prohibited under\nyour view from doing anything that the State could do by a\nState regulation.\nMS. BLATT: Right. I'm sorry. Right. Under --\nit -- the alternative theory would give more power to the\njury to impose labeling restrictions than the State, and\nwe don't think the State can do it. And it would be far\nmore pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury\ninvalidation. No one would read the label, much less\nunderstand it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, there's a brief in\nthis case -- there's a brief in this case that just shows\nhundreds, if not thousands, of crop damage claims. And\nyour theory is that with this ambiguous provision Congress\nwiped all that out. It's hard to believe.\nMS. BLATT: No. Congress just wiped out\nlabeling and only those labeling requirements --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But everything becomes -- but\nevery -- every time -- my crop was stunted. Okay. You\nhave to change the label so you can't bring that suit.\nMS. BLATT: Justice Ginsburg, it's just not\ntrue. The lower courts well understand this distinction,\nand they -- they let go all the time claims as not\npreempted that are true manufacturing defect or true\ndesign defect claims. This is not a complete immunity.\nThis is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling.\nThere is a famous example of the Benlate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He says their claim is -- is\nvery simple. You didn't tell us that using this in our\nkind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the\nweeds.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying that kind\nof claim can't be brought anymore.\nMS. BLATT: It can be brought if there's State\nlaw and evidence to support the State law that doesn't\nattack the labeling. And our --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I've described a set of facts\nwhich your position I think you have to say affects the\nlabel. The -- the farmer says I bought this bottle. It\nsaid okay for all peanuts. My crop grew and it was\nstunted and the weeds stayed alive.\nMS. BLATT: If they found an expert that said if\nyou had manufactured this differently or if you had\ndesigned it differently and there was evidence to support\nthat, our view is that those claims aren't preempted. And\nthe alternative to let juries --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I'm not giving you that\ncase. I'm giving you exactly what happened.\nMS. BLATT: This case -- they didn't have any\nevidence other than saying that the label was inaccurate.\nBut the next -- another jury could rely on the\nrespondent's evidence to say the label was inaccurate\nbecause it works better on high pH soil, and another jury\ncould say, well, we need a margin of safety and the label\nshould have said 6.8 instead of 7.0, which is what their\nexpert says. And you can have this time and time again\nwith how often the pesticide has to be applied, when it\nhas to be applied. And to -- and the -- the whole point\nof section 136v(b) was to have reliability --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that happening when EPA\ntook the opposite view? Was there this tremendous\ndisparity with juries going every which way --\nMS. BLATT: Well, there's -- there's been\npreemption at least since the late '80's, and I don't know\nof cases where juries -- or the theory for recovery was\ninvalidating the label.\nThere are lots of cases that are true\nmanufacturing defect claims, and I direct your attention\nto the Benlate where the manufacturer contaminated his\nproduct. If I'm the plaintiff, my theory -- the theory\nwas you mismanufactured this product. A reasonable\nmanufacturer would have taken practices to prevent\ncontamination, and it destroyed a lot of crops and EPA\nactually took enforcement action against that\nmanufacturer.\nThe rat poisoning example -- a 9-year-old kid\ndied of rat poisoning because it tasted like a candy bar.\nThe theory of recovery was all the manufacturer had to do\nwas put a bittering agent in it that would have made the\nkid throw up and the rats still would have loved the\npoisoning. That has nothing to do with the label.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nYou have about 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: I just have two points to make.\nWith respect to the summary judgment posture of\nthe case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the\nDistrict Court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that\nit had jurisdiction. On the very next day, Dow rushed\ninto court with its motion for summary judgment. And what\nMr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says\nthat on -- on this point it is neither unfair nor\npremature to require defendants to produce evidence in\nsupport of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy\nrequires. I'm reading from their motion for summary\njudgment. That was filed before the counterclaims.\nThe only thing that they knew about was the\ndeceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers\nhad filed pursuant to State law. So they didn't know what\nour claims were, and they were requiring or saying that\nthe District Court could throw us out of court without\ngiving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less\ntry to develop evidence that would prove them.\nNow, with respect to the disuniformity point,\nwhen Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word\nuniformity, it said in that public law that it was a\ntechnical amendment. We don't know why Congress put the\nword uniformity in. The legislative history is barren.\nIt just says this is a technical amendment. It didn't\nchange the substantive provisions that empowered States to\nimpose regulations that would have the effect of\ndisuniformity.\nNow, at the end of the day, we've got claims\nthat have been brought historically since the late 19th\ncentury. Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there\nwere decades in which juries made these decisions with\nrespect to these kinds of products, and those preemption\ndecisions really didn't take hold until after this Court\nannounced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that\npoint that the courts began to have preemption, but for\nthe previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these\nkinds of cases. The sky did not fall. EPA didn't come in\nand say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of\nthis. There simply were no problems. But what did happen\nwas that the farmers who used products were able to get\ncompensation when pesticides damaged their crops.\nThank you.\n"
