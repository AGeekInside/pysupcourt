GELLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis case concerns the applicability of the\nContract Disputes Act to contracts between National Park\nService and the private concessioners who contract to\nprovide visitor services and to operate and maintain\nfacilities in more than 100 of our national parks.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, I have a couple of\npreliminary questions.\nFirst of all, this is a facial challenge made by\nthe National Park Hospitality Association, I take it. How\nis the claim ripe for adjudication? Has the association\nbeen injured actually? There's no case pending.\nMR. GELLER: Your Honor, to begin with, let me\nsay that as to this facial challenge point, this -- this\nwas an argument that was never made below. It was not\nmade in the district court. It was not made in the court\nof appeals. It was not made in the opposition to\ncertiorari.\nQUESTION: Is it one that we're precluded from\nconcerning ourselves with?\nMR. GELLER: Well, I'm not sure it's a\njurisdictional issue.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GELLER: So it -- it may well be waived.\nBut let me also say quickly that I think this\nwhole --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, I think that -- I think\nthe ripeness issue --\nMR. GELLER: Yes, I was going to address\nripeness.\nQUESTION:\nfacial challenge.\nMR. GELLER: Right. I was going to address\nripeness separately, Justice Scalia. In terms of this\nfacial/as-applied, this is an APA challenge to a\nregulation. I'm not aware that the Court has really used\nthis facial/as-applied nomenclature --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GELLER: -- in that -- in that context.\nAfter all, under the APA, the question is whether a --\nan -- a regulation is arbitrary or capricious or contrary\nto law. Here we have a regulation that categorically\nstates no NPS -- no National Park Service concession\ncontracts are subject to the CDA. If there -- there are,\nin fact, some such contracts that are subject to the CDA,\nas we believe there are, then that regulation is arbitrary\nand capricious. The agency should have to go back and\ndraft a more refined regulation.\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that the standard for\nripeness --\nMR. GELLER: I --\nQUESTION: -- whether the regulation is arbitrary\nor --\nMR. GELLER: No, no, no. I --\nQUESTION: Why is this any different -- you\ncontend that the agency has no authority to speak\nauthoritatively on this -- on this issue anyway. And\ntherefore, this regulation, as I understand your -- your\nposition, is -- is of no more effect than the agency's\nannouncement of what its litigating position will be.\nMR. GELLER: Not quite, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. GELLER: I'm trying to -- I'm trying to\ndistinguish the facial/as-applied point that Justice\nO'Connor raised from the ripeness question, which I'll get\nto in just a minute.\nThis is not a -- a -- there was an as-applied\nchallenge, to begin with, made in the district court.\nThis is not a facial challenge in the sense that we're\nasking the Court to strike down the regulation based on\nhypotheticals or on factual situations that may never\narise. We know what these concessions contracts look\nlike. The NPS has issued standard concessions contracts.\nIt seems to us rather easy to determine whether the\nservices that are called for in those contracts bring the\ncontracts within the -- within the CDA. So I don't think\nthere's anything to this facial challenge.\nQUESTION: Well, presumably there are many\ndifferent kinds of concession contracts. Some might be\ncovered; some might not.\nMR. GELLER:\nO'Connor, because there are standard concessions\ncontracts. They're in the record and it's clear that they\ncall for certain types of services. And we think it's\nclear that the Court, as the two lower courts did, can\ndetermine whether those contracts call for the procurement\nof services that would bring them within the CDA or call\nfor the repair or maintenance of real property.\nNow --\nQUESTION: How many -- what are there? 10\nstandard concession contracts?\nMR. GELLER: Three. There are, I think, three.\nQUESTION: Three?\nMR. GELLER: And they all call for the same\ntypes of services at national parks. There are -- there\nare copies in the -- in the record.\nNow, in terms of your ripeness argument, Justice\nScalia, once again, the -- the Government never made any\nsuggestion that this case was not ripe below. The reason\nit's not unripe is that the standard concession contracts\nand the contracts that, in fact, the NPS is putting out\nfor bid incorporate within them the statement that these\ncontracts are not subject to the CDA. The NPHA and its\nmembers need to know now, in terms of deciding whether to\nbid on certain contracts, what their rights are under\nthose contracts, and therefore --\nQUESTION: But how -- how does it hurt you to --\nin the present posture, as I understand it, the\ncontracts -- whatever it's called -- the ICBA decides\nthese cases in your favor. So in the -- in the setting of\na concrete dispute, the contracting officer rules against\none of the concessionaires. The concessionaires goes to\nthat board if they want to and the board will rule, at\nleast on the jurisdictional point, that -- that the\nContracts Dispute Act does apply. So how are you hurting\nby --\nMR. GELLER: We are harmed, Justice Ginsburg,\nbecause it is important for the concessioners to know, at\nthe time that they're deciding whether to bid on a\ncontract and -- and the time they're deciding how much to\nbid on a contract, what their rights are under that\ncontract. It's a pre-bid -- it's a solicitation in which\nthe --\nQUESTION: That would be the same case if the\nagency simply announced, our litigating position in these\ncontracts is going to be that they are not covered by the\nContract Disputes Act.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, but the --\nQUESTION: You'd be in exactly the same\nposition.\nMR. GELLER: And we would be --\nQUESTION: Would -- would you have the ability\nto sue?\nMR. GELLER: We would be -- because it is a\nprovision of these contracts, Your Honor, that\nincorporates the regulation that states that they are not\nsubject to the CDA. So this is a proper challenge to the\nsolicitation as including an illegal term. The contracts,\non their face by incorporating this regulation, say you\nhave no rights under the CDA. It seems to us -- and we\nthink the law is clear, although the Government never made\nthis challenge, so it's not been briefed -- that the\nconcessioners have a right to know at the outset, in\ndeciding whether or not to bid, whether the Government is\nright in asserting that they have no rights under the CDA\nif they enter into these --\nQUESTION: Well, if it's an invalid provision,\ncould the contracting party simply contract and then go\ninto court later on and say, well, this clause is\nunenforceable?\nMR. GELLER: Well, I don't know, Justice\nKennedy. You would be signing a contract that agrees to\nthe provision in the contract that says that you have no\nrights enforceable under the CDA.\nBut beyond that, the Government has taken the\nposition you have no rights enforceable under the CDA. So\nit's not clear how you would follow through on your rights\nunder that --\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: If you're -- if you're right,\nMr. Geller, I suppose your client could go into court and\nask for a declaratory judgment, even though there's\nnothing in the contract saying, we want to find out which\nprovision of -- as to review applies to us.\nMR. GELLER: But this is a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to a regulation --\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's the problem.\nMR. GELLER: But --\nQUESTION: In the case that I put, I don't think\nyou could get declaratory relief until you've alleged that\nthere was going to be a dispute. You can say, yes, I --\nMR. GELLER: But there is a --\nQUESTION: -- I might have an argument down the\nline and I want to know where I want to go. That seems to\nme --\nMR. GELLER: But -- but, Justice Kennedy, the --\nQUESTION: -- speculative. I just don't see the\nharm to your client in waiting.\nMR. GELLER: The harm, Your Honor, is in not\nknowing, at the time you're being asked to bid on\ncontracts, what your rights are under those contracts.\nQUESTION: So it's --\nMR. GELLER: It's like any other provision.\nQUESTION: Is it established -- I mean, my -- my\nguess is it is, but -- but if the Government, the Defense\nDepartment, any other Department, presents a -- a private\nindividual with a contract with 14 conditions and one of\nthose conditions, in the view of the private person, is\nunlawful, not authorized by statute, contrary to statute,\nthat that person, before bidding on the contract, can go\nto court and say, I would like this set aside as unlawful.\nMR. GELLER: I think that there is a --\nQUESTION: Is there authority on that?\nMR. GELLER: I think that there's --\nQUESTION: If there is authority on that, I\nguess that's the end of it. You're right.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, I think there is authority\nunder -- under the -- under the Tucker Act, which is one\nof the provisions of -- that we cited in the complaint,\nthat allows you to bring challenges to bid solicitations\non the ground that they --\nQUESTION: And these regulations are\nincorporated into the contract.\nMR. GELLER: And these -- these are --\nabsolutely regulations are incorporated into the contract.\nQUESTION:\nYou said there is --\nMR. GELLER: I think it's section 1491. I mean,\nit -- it is one of the provisions that we relied on in\nthe -- in the complaint in this case to bring this\nchallenge.\nAnd I might say to the Court --\nQUESTION: Is there -- is there any case that\nsupports this particular --\nMR. GELLER: Yes, there are, but -- but I was\nabout to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that this -- that the\nGovernment has never challenged ripeness, and that's not\nsuggest -- it is not to suggest that it's not something\nthat this Court can consider, but I think it's unfair to\ndecide that issue on the -- when it hasn't been fully\nbriefed by the parties. It's never been challenged at any\ntime in this case.\nQUESTION: Unless it force -- unless the failure\nto consider it forces us to decide a case on -- on facts\nthat we find, you know, rather amorphous.\nMR. GELLER: But they're not amorphous, Justice\nScalia --\nQUESTION: That's the purpose of the ripeness\ndoctrine --\nMR. GELLER: -- because --\nQUESTION:\nthe case.\nMR. GELLER: I'm not suggesting the Court\ndoesn't have the authority to do it. I'm suggesting the\nissue has not been briefed, that we did present the Tucker\nAct as the basis for jurisdiction in the Court --\nQUESTION: Then is the issue before us --\nMR. GELLER: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Is the issue before us whether the\nthree contracts that are in the record are procurement\ncontracts within the meaning of the statute?\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's ripe because --\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- you have members of your\nassociation who are considering bidding on contracts\nthat contain -- that those three contracts, which are\nuniversal -- and they don't want to do it if -- or may or\nmay not want to if that -- that term is lawful. But they\nmight do it if it's --\nMR. GELLER: That's precisely -- that's\nprecisely right.\nQUESTION: And may I ask one other -- other\nquestion? The -- court of appeals addressed this part\nof -- of the case under its Roman III -- Roman III, I\nthink, the Contract Disputes Act.\nDisputes Act issue -- question have anything to do with\nthe other argument about whether or not these concessions\nare renewed? In other words, if a -- if it's not a --\nthese are just freestanding --\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- issues unrelated.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: All right. Thank you.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, they are.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, one other thing that I'm\ncurious about. Why does it matter? Why do you care --\nMR. GELLER: It --\nQUESTION: -- whether it's covered by the CDA?\nMR. GELLER: Because the --\nQUESTION: What's at stake here --\nMR. GELLER: That's important --\nQUESTION: -- in the real world?\nMR. GELLER: That's a very important question,\nJustice O'Connor. What is at stake are the rights --\nthe -- the rights, the substantive and the procedural\nrights, that are available to -- to a Government\ncontractor if it -- it gets into a dispute with the --\nwith the contracting agency.\nNow, under the CDA, there are very important\nprocedural and substantive rights that are available that\nwould not be available under other law, and that's -- that\nwas --\nQUESTION: Well, like what? I mean, what --\nMR. GELLER: For example --\nQUESTION: -- what's at stake?\nMR. GELLER: What's at stake principally is,\nfirst of all, an administrative mechanism, which is these\nboards of contract appeals, that would -- are available to\ndecide these matters expeditiously and particularly with\nsmall claims without having to go to court.\nQUESTION: As opposed to what?\nMR. GELLER: As opposed to having to go to\ncourt, as opposed to having to go to the Court of Federal\nClaims where it's not even clear what the standard of\nreview would be. The standard of review under the CDA is\nde novo. So that's a very important substantive and\nprocedural right, in addition to --\nQUESTION: De novo for who? For the contract\nboard or for the court if you go --\nMR. GELLER: Both. After the contracting\nofficer decides an issue adversely to the contractor under\nthe CDA, the contractor has the choice either to go to the\nBoard of Contract Appeals or to file a lawsuit in the\nCourt of Federal Claims. In either event, the review is\nde novo.\nQUESTION: And if he chooses the contract board,\nthen the -- the next step, the court step will be --\nMR. GELLER: In the Federal Circuit.\nQUESTION: Directly to the circuit.\nMR. GELLER: Right.\nQUESTION: You wouldn't go to the --\nMR. GELLER: Right.\nQUESTION: And that wouldn't be de novo, I take\nit.\nMR. GELLER: No, it wouldn't be de novo. That\nwould be appellate.\nQUESTION: But the main thing, as I understood\nit, was that you're trying to get out of the agency\nappeals. You don't want to have to go through the agency.\nThis gets you right into court after the --\nMR. GELLER: No.\nQUESTION: -- contracting officer. Am I right\nabout that?\nMR. GELLER: No, and it's not right, Justice\nBreyer. Actually what we want to be able to do is to\navoid having to follow whatever procedures the agency sets\nup in its contract for -- for seeking review if there's a\ndispute. We want to go --\nQUESTION: But why can't you do that? That's\nwhat you've been doing all along.\nhave the several decisions of the IBCA. Every time you go\nto the IBCA, they say, yes.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, but the Interior Department\nand the NPS has not acceded to those decisions, and it has\nissued a regulation that is --\nQUESTION: But then isn't -- isn't the\nappropriate thing to go? You go to the IBCA. If the\nGovernment wants to challenge the jurisdiction that they\nwill exercise, the resolution that they make, then it's up\nto the Government. But you can go to the IBCA. They have\nbeen welcoming you.\nMR. GELLER: Well, those were all prior to the\nGovernment's issuance of the regulation in this case, a\nregulation that's now been upheld by the D.C. Circuit.\nQUESTION: Well, but you -- you say the\nGovernment's issuance of a --\nMR. GELLER: The NPS.\nQUESTION: It's the National Park Service.\nMR. GELLER: Yes, yes. Well, that's what we're\ndealing with here.\nQUESTION: There's some dispute as to whether\nthey even have the authority to issue it.\nMR. GELLER: They don't, in fact, administer the\nCDA, Your Honor, so we don't think this is a regulation\nthat's entitled to any deference.\nposition.\nQUESTION: They -- they seem to agree with you\non this point. I mean, they've -- they've agreed in their\nterms that it's not a legislative regulation in that --\nMR. GELLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- footnote 5 or 6 --\nMR. GELLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- whatever it is. What does that do\nto -- to our jurisdiction? I mean, is -- is -- are -- are\nyou now both --\nMR. GELLER: I don't think --\nQUESTION: -- in effect, claiming that this\nso-called regulation is nothing but the Government's\nstatement of the intention to take a position when and\nif --\nMR. GELLER: Well, the --\nQUESTION: -- the time comes?\nMR. GELLER: Our view is that this is a\nregulation that represents the views of the NPS. It's not\nentitled to any deference because it's not a statute that\nthey administer. The Government would have to give you\nits view of how much deference it is entitled to.\nQUESTION: Well, how do you read the --\nMR. GELLER: But this is still an APA --\nQUESTION:\nthe footnote? Because apparently --\nMR. GELLER: I find that --\nQUESTION: -- I -- I take it that is new, by the\nway.\nMR. GELLER: I find that --\nQUESTION: Am I correct?\nMR. GELLER: -- footnote very confusing.\nQUESTION: So you -- you're recalling\nchallenging not the -- not the ineffective regulation, but\nrather the inclusion of what the regulation says --\nMR. GELLER: We're challenging both.\nQUESTION: -- in the contracts. Is that --\nMR. GELLER: We're challenging both. We brought\nan APA challenge to the regulation, as well as a Tucker\nAct challenge and a pre-bid solicitation challenge to the\ninclusion of these -- this -- this illegal term in the --\nin the contracts.\nQUESTION: But isn't it the case that unless you\nhave an -- an APA issue, there's nothing else that you can\nlitigate at this point? I mean, if the only thing that\nyou have to complain about is that they want to put a term\nin a contract that you think they shouldn't be putting in,\nit's up to you to decide whether you want to contract it\non those terms or not.\nMR. GELLER:\nwe're entitled to challenge that solicitation as illegal.\nWe have to bid on these contracts, we're entitled to\nknow --\nQUESTION: No, but at this stage of the game,\nthey're not claiming that their regulation is -- is what\nthey call a legislative regulation.\nMR. GELLER: They are claiming that that is the\nposition that they're going to take and that it is\nentitled to some level of deference.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. GELLER: That footnote clearly says that it\nis entitled to some level of deference.\nQUESTION: And --\nMR. GELLER: This is clearly the position, and\nit's been upheld by the D.C. Circuit. There's no reason\nto suggest they're not going to adamantly enforce their --\ntheir views.\nQUESTION: But then -- but if the case isn't\nripe and we should so hold, I assume the appropriate thing\nto do would be to vacate the D.C. Circuit's decision to\nthat extent.\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: So then you'll be -- what you would\nbe -- have is the Government has told you in advance what\nits litigating position would be and it has no more\nmeaning than a -- a statement of what the Government's --\nMR. GELLER: But it is --\nQUESTION: -- position is with no -- no --\nMR. GELLER: But, Justice Ginsburg, as I said,\nthere's still this provision in all of the contracts.\nQUESTION: The Government would still be asking\nyou to enter a contract --\nMR. GELLER: The Government would still be\nasking us to accede to a position and sign a contract that\ncontains a term which we believe is illegal that says we\nhave no rights under the CDA.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what if the Government\ncontract had a term that simply said, you know, there\nwould be damages for delay, double damages depending on\nthe amount of delay? And you say, well, I -- we don't\nthink the Government is authorized to put that in a\ncontract. Could you challenge that?\nMR. GELLER: Yes. I believe so, Mr. Chief\nJustice. There is a very large body of Government\ncontracting law -- it's not in the briefs because it\nwasn't raised -- allowing --\nQUESTION: Well, is it --\nMR. GELLER: -- allowing these sorts of\nchallenges to illegal terms in contracts.\nQUESTION: But where is the law?\nin the cases of this Court?\nMR. GELLER: Well, obviously, these -- these\ncases are generally litigated in the -- in the Court of\nFederal Claims and in the district courts.\nQUESTION: Is -- is that where the law is, in\nthe Court of Federal Claims?\nMR. GELLER: Yes. Well, there are probably some\nappellate decisions as well, but the law is fairly\nwell-settled in this area. As I say, the Government has\nnever challenged the ripeness of the CDA --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, you say -- you say it's\nsettled, and please correct me if I'm wrong if -- if\nAbbott Laboratories has been overtaken. But my notion was\nthat in order to have a pre-enforcement challenge, you had\nto have a pretty strong claim that you are hurting now, as\nthey were, if they didn't -- if they spent all that money.\nMR. GELLER: Yes. Abbott Laboratories is -- is\nobviously an APA case. I think we could meet that\nstandard because we need to know now whether we should bid\non these contracts.\nBut there's a separate body of law involving\nsolicitations for Government contracts is what I'm saying\nto the Court.\nQUESTION: And does that get you --\nQUESTION:\nthink.\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And does that give you an APA cause\nof action?\nMR. GELLER: Well, we brought both an APA cause\nof action and a challenge under the -- under the Tucker\nAct, and you know, we would maintain that we can challenge\nthis regulation, and in addition, we can challenge this\nbid solicitation. The two really overlap because the\nregulation is incorporated into the contract.\nQUESTION: Was there any finding in the district\ncourt that the inclusion of this provision was critical as\nto whether or not you'd go ahead with the contract?\nMR. GELLER: There was no such --\nQUESTION: I mean, I --\nMR. GELLER: There -- there was no such --\nQUESTION: -- I find it a little hard -- if it's\na -- if it's a really good contract, you I suppose intend\nto comply with it and you don't think there's going to be\nany litigation at all.\nMR. GELLER: Well, Your -- there was -- there\nwas no finding by the district court, Your Honor, because\nthere was not -- there was no challenge to the ripeness by\nthe Government, but the -- the complaint, as I recall, did\nmake that allegation.\nthat the contractors needed to know whether these\ncontracts were covered by the CDA.\nQUESTION: When you say these --\nQUESTION: Well, could it make the further\nallegation that if it -- if it were not -- that if it\nwere -- were not covered, it would not engage in the\nnegotiations at all?\nMR. GELLER: I don't specifically recall that\nallegation.\nQUESTION: It's a commercial matter. It's hard\nfor me to see it if there's an advantageous contract, but\nyou're not going to execute it --\nMR. GELLER: Well, but it's a question of how --\nQUESTION: -- if you go through one form of\nremedy or the other in the event of a breach.\nMR. GELLER: But it's not binary, Justice\nKennedy. Maybe you would still enter into the contract\nnegotiations. It's one factor in deciding how much you'll\nbid on the contract.\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller, you -- when you say these\ncontracts --\nMR. GELLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- you keep referring to these\ncontracts. They're -- actually you're talking about three\ncontract forms.\nparticular --\nMR. GELLER: Well, there are --\nQUESTION: -- bid solicitation. You -- you have\nno particular bid solicitation, do you?\nMR. GELLER: Well, no. Well, that's not\nprecisely true, Justice Scalia, because there were bid\nsolicitations. In the district court, there were -- there\nwere lawsuits brought both by the National Park\nHospitality Association on behalf of its members, as well\nas -- as lawsuits brought by several concessioners\nchallenging specific bid solicitations as to them. And --\nand therefore, there was both facial and as-applied, in\neffect, challenges to the -- to the CDA point in the -- in\nthe --\nQUESTION: What they say then is the\nGovernment -- as far as I understand it, the basic point\nis that this is not a procurement contract regardless of\nwho's entitled to what deference. And the reason that it\nisn't is because we are not buying anything, and that\nisn't a technical point. That is an important point\nbecause you and us -- you, the private, and we, the\nGovernment -- are both in the business of selling things\nto the Government. We need somewhat more control over the\ninterpretation of these contracts. And that's why the\nnumber of procedures you have to go through in the parks\ndepartment is greater, and all the things that you don't\nlike about it are things we do like about it. Namely, we\nget a little bit added control. But that's why\nlegitimately these are not procurement contracts.\nNow, your point in response to roughly that,\nor --\nMR. GELLER: Well --\nQUESTION: I'm just trying to get you to the\nmerits, so I thought I'd --\nMR. GELLER: Yes. I'd like to turn to the\nmerits. Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nCan I -- I'd like to begin by saying it's purely\na matter of statutory construction, and we think that the\nstatute on its face unambiguously answers the question\nbefore the Court. And I think it would be helpful if the\nCourt could look at section 3(a) of the Contract Disputes\nAct which -- which appears in many places, including\npage 1 of the blue brief, because you'll see that section\n3(a) states that unless specifically excluded therein, the\nCDA applies to, quote, any express or implied contract\nentered into by an executive agency for, among other\nthings, the procurement of services or the procurement of\nconstruction, repair, or maintenance of real property.\nQUESTION: The reason that doesn't help you is\nbecause --\nMR. GELLER: The --\nQUESTION: -- the question is what's\nprocurement.\nMR. GELLER: Well, I'm not sure that that's\nnecessarily the question, but let me address it this way,\nYour Honor.\nThe National Park Service does not contend that\nits concessions contracts are not contracts within the\nmeaning of the CDA. It doesn't contend that it's not an\nexecutive agency. And the NPS doesn't contend that any\nprovision of the CDA or, for that matter, any other\nFederal statute specifically excludes these contracts from\nthe -- from the CDA. And, Justice Breyer, the NPS really\ndoesn't even take issue with the fact that these\nconcessions contracts procure services and procure the\nconstruction, repair, and maintenance of real property.\nIn other words, every single statutory requirement on the\nface of the statute would seem to be satisfied --\nQUESTION: But I thought they did challenge that\nthese are -- that it's procurement.\nMR. GELLER: They do not challenge, Your Honor,\nthat -- that these contracts procure services --\nQUESTION: In the -- in the sense of procurement\nas used in Government contracting?\nMR. GELLER:\nthe case. The Government claims --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's the issue in the\ncase.\nMR. GELLER: The Government --\nQUESTION: I tried to --\nMR. GELLER: And I would like to turn to that\nnow because the Government claims that these contracts are\nnot within the protection of the CDA. And why? Its\nentire argument amounts to the following.\nThe Government says that the word procurement\nand the phrase, procurement contract, we are told, have a\nuniversally understood and well-settled meaning. And they\ntell us that to qualify as a procurement contract, the\nGovernment says, an acquisition must be for the direct use\nand benefit of the Government and it must be paid for with\nwhat the Government calls Government funds.\nNow, the first thing to be said, Justice Breyer,\nabout the Government's argument is that it is a complete\ninvention. It is a complete invention. No Federal\nstatute defines the word procurement or the word,\nprocurement contract, to include the two requirements that\nthe Government tells us are essential. In fact, the\nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy Act -- the Government\ncites lots and lots of --\nQUESTION:\nnatural meaning. If they -- if they have a concessionaire\nto come and sell balloons on the Fourth of July, they\ndon't say they've procured some balloons. They say\nthey've arranged for some balloons.\nMR. GELLER: Well, you'd say arranged. You\ncould say they procured having someone sell balloons at\nthe Fourth of July.\nThe -- the Office of Federal Procurement Policy\nAct --\nQUESTION: No, but that -- that -- that's not\nthe usual meaning of -- of procure, I should think.\nMR. GELLER: But the -- but there is no statute\nthat -- the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act,\nwhich is a companion statute to the CDA, actually has a\ndefinition of the word procurement. You wouldn't know it\nfrom reading the Government's brief because in their -- it\ndoesn't refer to that, but it contains a definition of the\nword procurement that does not contain either of the two\nrequirements that the Government tells us are essential to\na Government procurement.\nNo court has ever construed the word procurement\nto include the two requirements that the Government tells\nus are clearly established and well-settled by Federal\nprocurement --\nQUESTION: Mr. Geller --\nQUESTION: What about acquiring --\nQUESTION: -- I'm looking at page 19 of the\nGovernment's brief, and they -- they define procurement.\nThey're taking it from the -- the Federal acquisition\nregulations to say acquiring by contract with appropriated\nfunds supplies or services by and for the use of the\nFederal Government. So --\nMR. GELLER: Yes. That's -- that's not a\nstatute, but let me address that, Justice Ginsburg.\nFirst of all, appropriated funds. It is\nclear -- and the Government has not challenged the fact --\nthat the CDA applies to contracts even when appropriated\nfunds are not used. That's clear on the face of the CDA.\nSo the Government is forced to come -- come up with this\nnew phrase, Government funds, which has, as far as we can\ntell, no basis at all in any prior statute or any Federal\nprocurement law. And the fact --\nQUESTION: It does have a basis in just what\nJustice Ginsburg was quoting, 48 C.F.R. 2.101. So they\nsay it's not without foundation in the law. What -- what\nthat's from is, I take it, it's a memo that -- or a policy\nissued jointly by the Secretary of Defense, the\nAdministrator of General Services, and the NPS\nAdministrator. So when they have a reg like that, I'd --\nI'd think that it's not so that it isn't somewhere in\nFederal law. It's right there.\nNow, there are some other things there --\nMR. GELLER: But --\nQUESTION: -- that you say are not necessarily\npart of procurement. But that fact that there are other\nthings that overstate it doesn't mean this does.\nMR. GELLER: But, Your Honor, there are many\nother -- the Government principally relies on other\nstatutes that have the -- have certain provisions like the\nones they would like to introduce into the CDA in them.\nBut I think it's quite significant that Congress didn't\nput these provisions in the CDA.\nQUESTION: But what about -- he put one in -- in\nthe CDA, 41 U.S.C., section 612(c). It's discussed at the\nbottom of page 18 and the top of page 19 of -- of the\nGovernment's brief. And what it says is that the monetary\nawards in favor of a contractor will be paid out of the\njudgment fund and in turn provides for the reimbursement\nto the judgment fund, quote, by the agency whose\nappropriations were used for the contract, which would\nsuggest that in all cases --\nMR. GELLER: I don't think it -- it does not --\nQUESTION: -- where there's been a judgment --\nMR. GELLER: It doesn't suggest that at all,\nJustice Scalia.\nincompletely. It also --\nQUESTION: Yes, well, tell me why. I -- I know\nthat your --\nMR. GELLER: In -- in our --\nQUESTION: -- reply brief -- I don't see how\nthe -- the --\nMR. GELLER: In our reply brief, it says, by\nsuch appropriated -- by -- by the appropriations of that\nagency or such other appropriations as the agency has to\nget.\nNow, the NPS is a -- a --\nQUESTION: But -- but it clearly envisions\nappropriations, whether they have it already or they have\nto get it later.\nMR. GELLER: But the -- the CDA on its face --\nand the Government concedes this -- applies to contracts\nthat don't involve appropriated funds agencies.\nQUESTION: Well, we'll ask the Government about\nthat. That's a -- that's a much more serious point.\nMR. GELLER: Yes. I think it's clear there's\nno -- there's no doubt that the CDA applies to any\ncontract whether or not it's an appropriated funds agency\nor not.\nLet me just say that in addition to being, I\nthink, totally unsupported as a matter of law, the\nlimitations that the NPS asks this Court to read into the\nCDA would be completely unworkable as a matter of\npractice. I think we've already talked about the\nGovernment funds point which is, I think, a phrase that\nthey have dreamt up. It has no basis in law, unlike\nappropriated funds, which is not the case of the CDA.\nBut I think it's also the case that this use or\nbenefit to the Government notion is completely unworkable.\nIf, for example, the NPS were to go out and procure water\ncoolers for use in the Department of Interior building,\nthe NPS would concede that those would be within the\nContract Disputes Act because they're -- they're for the\nuse and benefit of the Government. If the Government were\nto go out and procure the same water coolers for use on\nthe Mall during the Fourth of July, the Court -- the NPS\nwould say, well, that's not for the use or benefit of the\nGovernment. I don't know how you could decide what is for\nthe use or benefit of the Government.\nWhen -- if the Government -- if the NPS issues a\ncontract to build a -- the World War II Memorial on the\nMall, which is now being -- is now happening, is that for\nthe use of the public or it is used for the Government?\nWe don't think this is a defensible position, and it\ncertainly finds no basis in the CDA. We think it's an\nirrational reading of the act that has no support in the\nlanguage or the legislative history or the purpose of the\nstatute.\nAnd I want to say that even if there was a use\nor benefit to the Government limitation in the CDA, we\nthink it would -- these contracts would still clearly\nsatisfy it because these concessions contracts are being\nlet in part to help the Department of Interior, the NPS\nfulfill its statutory mission. If these concessions were\nnot there operating these restaurants or guest facilities,\nthe NPS would have to operate them themselves in order to\nsatisfy its -- the statutory requirement that they provide\nfor the use and enjoyment of the national parks. So we\ndon't think it's possible to say that these concession\ncontracts the -- that the NPS is completely indifferent to\nthese concession contracts. They are clearly for the use\nand benefit not only of the public, but also of the NPS.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Geller.\nMr. Elwood, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ELWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nQUESTION:\ndoesn't want the CDA applicable here? I mean, what's --\nwhat's at stake for the Government in not applying it?\nMR. ELWOOD: Justice -- Justice O'Connor, the\nreason why the Government doesn't want this applicable\nhere is that the Contract Dispute Act was passed to\naddress specific shortcomings in the remedial scheme that\nwas available for procurement contracts, and because it\nwas designed specifically for those purposes, it have --\nhas terms that we don't think are appropriate in this\ncontext. For example --\nQUESTION: But that just doesn't tell me, as a\npractical matter, why the Government doesn't want it\napplicable here.\nMR. ELWOOD: For example, the pre-judgment\ninterest remedy. Congress --\nQUESTION: You don't want to pay pre-judgment\ninterest.\nMR. ELWOOD: Right, and we don't think it's\nappropriate. Congress provided pre-judgment interest in\nthe procurement context because procurement contractors\nwould be required to perform under the contract even\nduring the pendency of a dispute when they weren't being\npaid. And it was because of that unique position where\nthey were both being required to make outlays without\ngetting any income that Congress thought that because\nthere was a --\nQUESTION: Okay. So at bottom, that's it, the\npre-judgment interest feature.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I think that and because --\nthere are other things as well. For example, the purpose\nof the -- one of the purposes of the CDA was to cut\nthrough all of these requirements that you exhaust\nadministrative remedies, but those simply aren't present\nin the concessions context. Traditionally concessioners\nhad a direct right of access to courts, and Congress has\nnever indicated that they thought the remedial scheme was\ninadequate for concessioners. And --\nQUESTION: Is this -- is this claim ripe? And\nwhy didn't you ever talk about it below? What's going on?\nIt's -- it comes in such an odd posture. What is the\nGovernment's view on that?\nMR. ELWOOD: The reason why we did not raise\nthis -- why we did not raise this is because we did not\nraise it below. And as you can tell from the pleadings --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. ELWOOD: -- is -- because the CDA was kind\nof a side show below. It was a relatively small issue and\nit was just not the focus of the proceedings, as you can\ntell by the opinion.\nBut I think that the Court has raised valid\nconcerns about the ripeness in this sense. The Court has\ntraditionally said in a pre-enforcement challenge to a\nregulation that a claim is ripe if it affects primary\nconduct so that -- so that if they don't comply, they\nmight be held liable. That's the Abbott Labs line of\ncases.\nAnd here this doesn't affect primary conduct.\nIt -- it predominantly just says whether or not -- which\nforum you're going to have a remedy in.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I would agree --\nQUESTION: What about this -- what about the --\nthe reply? I came in thinking ripeness was a problem, and\nyour brother on the other side gave to me what was a very\nconvincing answer. What's wrong with that answer?\nMR. ELWOOD: And that is -- the thing is because\nit predominantly just determines which forum you have --\nwhich forum you bring your claim in, I don't know --\nQUESTION: I know it doesn't affect -- but what\nthey're saying is that where the Government offers general\ncontracts to the industry and there is a term in all of\nthose contracts which, in the view of the industry, is\nunlawful, they -- it's ripe for them to challenge that.\nNow, what I'm afraid here would be that we or you or\nsomebody, in deciding whether that's an incorrect\nargument, would upset what could be -- I have no idea if\nit is -- a practice of contractors objecting to terms in\noffered contracts as contrary to law.\nSo are you saying now that that is not ripe?\nAre you saying that a contractor who comes into a court\nand objects to a term in a proposed contract as contrary\nto law does not have a claim because it is not ripe? Is\nthat the Government's position?\nMR. ELWOOD: No, I don't think that would be our\nposition. If it affects their primary --\nQUESTION: No. I would think probably you would\nat least want to brief it.\nMR. ELWOOD: Right.\nI think that if it affects their primary\nconduct, if affects what their obligations would be under\nthe contract, I think that that claim would be ripe for\npre-enforcement review. But where it simply determines\nwhich forum they'll bring the claim in, I don't think it\nwould be covered.\nQUESTION: But they said it's the first that's\nat issue here. Now, is it not because -- you heard what\nhe said. So --\nMR. ELWOOD: That -- that's correct. But I\nthink simply because it determines which forum you bring\nyour claim in, I don't think it would be covered. If I\nwere --\nQUESTION: So you -- so there's a dispute\nbetween the two sides on what the case law says as to\nwhether -- and it isn't even a general -- a general attack\nupon the form of -- upon a form contract. But as we\nunderstand from petitioners, there were particular bids\noutstanding that were challenged because -- because of a\nterm in them that -- that was claimed to be unlawful. And\nit is your position that you cannot challenge a particular\nbid because of an unlawful term unless that unlawful term\naffects your primary conduct.\nMR. ELWOOD: No. If it affects something other,\nI think, than the forum in which it was brought, I mean,\nif it affects what you think your obligations will be,\nif -- if it affects the price that you think you should\npay or that you should bid on a contract, I think that\nthat would be --\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it does on your analysis.\nMR. ELWOOD: -- subject to pre-enforcement\nreview.\nQUESTION: Doesn't it? I mean, you said one of\nthe things that is important is pre-judgment interest. So\nI -- I suppose their liability under the contract is going\nto be affected by -- by the correctness of the reg.\nMR. ELWOOD: I don't think their liability --\nQUESTION:\ntheir potential liability, if there is a contract dispute,\nwould be.\nMR. ELWOOD: Your Honor, I confess that I am not\nsure if the Government gets pre-judgment interest under\nthe CDA or not. But if it were -- if -- if it simply ran\nto the contractors, I think that -- that the prospective\ninterest on a claim that has not even arisen yet seems a\nlittle vague --\nQUESTION: Why is that vague? I mean, they --\nthey have to make a bid. They have accountants. These\nare big companies. They calculate everything down to the\nfinest penny, and -- and they say, you know, we take into\naccount whether we're going to get pre-judgment interest,\nwhich we -- if we have a dispute. And by the way, we have\none dispute every 3 hours, and so it's a lot of money to\nus. And we will bid $42.36 less if we're not getting\nthe -- whatever. All right? So they work it all out.\nThey have accountants who do it.\nAnd so, if that's so -- of course, if it isn't\nso, it's a different story. But they've said something\nlike that's so.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think it -- it would turn on --\nin that case I just don't think that in advance you can\nsay with enough sort of concreteness and specificity that\nyou know how much a particular claim -- the -- the as-yet\nunfiled, unrealized contract claims would be worth. You\ncould say --\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Elwood, isn't it really --\nisn't a waiver of pre-judgment interest comparable to a\nwaiver of punitive damages, for example, which if you\ninsist on it, would affect the -- the amount one would bid\nfor a contract? I don't understand why you say it's worth\nnothing.\nMR. ELWOOD: I mean --\nQUESTION: I mean, it's something -- if the\nGovernment is willing to fight about it here and insist --\nand put it in every contract, it must be of value to the\nGovernment.\nMR. ELWOOD: What is actually -- just if I could\nclarify this. What is put into the contract is just a\ngeneral term that applicable law will apply and because\napplicable law includes all regulations, it is\nincorporated that way. It doesn't specifically include a\nCDA waiver or anything of that sort.\nQUESTION: So the contract itself does not\nspecify that the CDA does not apply.\nMR. ELWOOD: No. It just says applicable law\ngoverns the contract.\nBut I think it's just a matter --\nQUESTION:\nyou said your -- your interpretation now of the -- the\nposition that the Park Service is taking that it -- it\ndoesn't constitute law? How can it constitute law? First\nof all, the Contract Dispute Act is not within the Park\nService bailiwick. It isn't -- as you concede, it isn't\nthe -- doesn't administer this act. So does that\nregulation constitute any kind of law?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that that's a valid concern\nbecause our position is that this is basically just an\ninterpretive rule announcing the position that the Park\nService will take and the Park -- and the position that\nthe Park Service employees will take in administering it.\nQUESTION: So you're saying -- you -- you claim\nthat this provision is not incorporated in the contracts.\nIs that the position the Government is taking?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think -- honestly, Justice\nScalia, I think it's just -- it's a -- it's a new\nproposition for me, and I think that a good argument could\nbe made that it does not include it because it -- it\nreally just represents the position of the National Park\nService.\nQUESTION: Even leaving aside the question of\ninclusion, what is -- what do you understand your\ndifference to be from the petitioners with respect to the\nstatus of the regulation itself?\nat all?\nMR. ELWOOD: I don't know that there is a -- a\ndifference with respect to the petitioner's view. It's an\ninterpretive rule that the Park Service has --\nQUESTION: Have we got any jurisdiction left?\nMR. ELWOOD: I believe so because it is the\nannounced position. It's not just a policy statement. It\nis basically a directive to the --\nQUESTION: Yes, but what's the difference\nbetween a policy statement and an announced position?\nThe -- the point at which each one is going to have\npractical effect is the point at which there is a claimed\nbreach and an argument, if there is one, over what the\nremedial process is.\nMR. ELWOOD: Yes, but I think that the only\ndifference would be the -- the principal difference would\nbe policy statements are more -- involve more variance in\nthat they say as a general policy we will do this, whereas\nthe -- as an interpretive rule, it just says that we do\nnot believe that concession contracts are procurement\ncontracts.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the position of the\nGovernment? Now, I know this is hitting you cold, but I\nthink it would be helpful.\nPosition one.\nbefore, and the case has been argued and submitted on the\nassumption that, for example, the bidding would be\naffected by this term which is incorporated into the\ncontract. That's been the assumption, and we see no\nreason to depart from it. It's not jurisdictional. So\ndecide the issue we briefed. That's position one.\nPosition two. We haven't thought of ripeness\nbefore, but now that we think about it, we think it's\nquite a serious problem and we're not certain what the --\nwhat the -- what the issue is in ordinary contracts, and\nwe're not certain whether it's incorporated. So we think\nyou should say that this case is not ripe.\nNow, do you take position one, which will mean\nwe perhaps could go to decide the issue for which it was\ngranted, or do you take position two, which means you see\nripeness as a big problem here that we ought to look at\nfurther?\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, Justice Breyer, it's clearly\nbeen the position of the Court that it is not bound by the\nfailure of the parties to raise it. That's in Reno versus\nCatholic Social Services, and of course, you can raise\nit --\nQUESTION: I'm not asking you what the law is\nexactly. I'm asking you what's the Government's position.\nMR. ELWOOD:\nbe -- I mean, we -- we filed a brief in opposition and I\nthink, you know, if -- if we can win on ripeness grounds,\nthat's great too.\nQUESTION: Well, you wouldn't necessarily --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You wouldn't necessarily win. I\nmean, I -- I don't know if you would win. I mean --\nMR. ELWOOD: Right. We might lose the -- the\njudgment of the D.C. Circuit as well, but --\nQUESTION: You -- you would have to. If it's\nnot ripe, we'd have to vacate it to that extent. But\nthis -- in the D.C. Circuit --\nQUESTION: Put you back to square one. No --\nQUESTION: In the D.C. Circuit, this was a\ngiant, one of those typical wholesale attacks on many,\nmany regulations, on the whole -- on the whole rulemaking.\nIs that correct?\nMR. ELWOOD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And this was just a tiny, tiny piece\nof a long, long opinion --\nMR. ELWOOD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- treating -- so maybe just nobody\nnoticed.\nQUESTION: It seems unfair to pick it apart in\nthis way.\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, I think that it -- it just\npoints out the fact that, I mean, they -- they had an\nawful lot on their plate, and it perhaps eluded them for\nthat reason.\nQUESTION: Now, the as-applied/facial. Was the\nas-applied challenges -- did those center on this issue or\ndid they relate to the -- to another issue?\nMR. ELWOOD: They related to other claims,\nJustice Ginsburg. Xanterra has characterized their claim\nas an as-applied claim although they're -- they're not\nasking for as-applied review in this case. But if you\nlook at their -- their complaint, their complaint involved\ntheir intention to bid on an as-yet unreleased prospectus.\nAnd so, in that sense, I don't think that is an as-applied\nchange for two -- for two reasons. Not only is there no\ncontract dispute, but at the time that the complaint was\nfiled, there was no contract. So we think that it would\nbe a facial challenge.\nQUESTION: Mr. Elwood, if I can assist you in\ngiving the merits here, is it -- is it the case, as the\npetitioners contend, that the Government concedes that not\nall contracts covered by the CDA are contracts in which\nappropriated funds are used?\nMR. ELWOOD: That's correct. To the extent that\nit covers non-appropriated fund instrumentalities, it\ncovers contracts that would involve the expenditure of\nnon-appropriated funds. Those are, however, Government\nfunds, funds of Government entities known as non-\nappropriated fund instrumentalities.\nQUESTION: Well, once you slip off from\nappropriated into -- into Government funds, you don't put\nany -- you don't have any statutory text you can appeal to\nas -- as separating out the CDA from -- from your Park\nService concessions.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't agree, Justice Scalia.\nBoth the -- well, to begin with, just in terms of giving\nan indication of what the commonly accepted meaning of the\nterm was at the time, the Commission on Government\nProcurement Reform, which was the -- which was the impetus\nfor all of these reforms, defined procurement as purchase\nof product or service for Federal use, which incorporates\nboth a -- a notion of expenditure and Federal use. And\nboth the -- the 1969 act --\nQUESTION: Yes, but Federal use, of course -- it\nis of use to the Park Service to have facilities available\nto the public. So that doesn't really answer the\nquestion. The parks -- the Park Service wants parks\navailable to the public with services in them, restrooms\nand buildings and restaurants and so forth. Doesn't it?\nSo in a sense, it is for the use of the Park Service and\nthe Government as well as for the public.\nMR. ELWOOD: It is for the use -- well, it is\nnot for the direct use of the National Park Service, and\nthat is where the Federal grant and cooperative agreement\ncomes in. 8 months before passage of the CDA, Congress\nexplained its understanding of what different types of\ninstruments would be used for, and it explained in that\nthat a procurement contract would be an instrument whose\nprincipal purpose is the acquisition by purchase, lease,\nor barter of goods or services for the direct use and\nbenefit of the Government. And --\nQUESTION: Well, it doesn't really say that.\nAnd the language in the CDA is broad, and presumably this\nwas a -- an act that was presumed to have broad\napplication.\nMR. ELWOOD: It was presumed to have broad\napplication among procurement contracts. There's no\nindication that they did not intend the word procurement\nto have the ordinary meaning that it does in that sense,\nas indicated in the Commission on Government Procurement\nReform and the way it was used there, as indicated in the\n1969 act creating the commission and the OFPP Act where\nthe simple use -- word procurement was understood to\nmean --\nQUESTION:\noffered in Congress to make clear that it didn't apply to\nconcession contracts?\nMR. ELWOOD: There was no -- no, there was no\nindication in the entire legislative history that the --\nthat concessions came up, and in 1,200 pages of reports on\nboth procurement and non-appropriated fund procurement,\nthere was not a single mention of -- of -- national parks\nconcessions.\nQUESTION: And how long -- at -- at any point\ndid the CDA -- was it applied or followed with any\nconcession contracts, or is this something that has arisen\nrecently? Was it used at one point?\nMR. ELWOOD: There are a number of Armed Service\nBoard of Contract Appeals that assume CDA jurisdiction,\nand the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of\nInterior started using it in 1989. But I'm not familiar\nwith usage prior to that --\nQUESTION: These are for what concessions?\nPS -- PX concessions, for example?\nMR. ELWOOD: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that -- I mean --\nbecause I was about to ask that question because I thought\nyou're drawing the distinction between a concession to\nprovide food and hot dogs and amusement to visitors to the\npark, which you say is not covered by the CDA, and it\nseems to me, a contract to provide food and hot dogs\nand -- I don't know -- maybe amusement -- I don't know\nwhat they have at PX's -- to members of the armed forces.\nWhy isn't at least the latter, although it's a concession\ncontract, why isn't that clearly for the benefit of the\nGovernment even -- even in the narrow sense in which you\nuse that term?\nMR. ELWOOD: No, Justice Scalia. We would -- we\nwould agree that that is for the benefit of the\nGovernment. It's -- it doesn't involve the expenditure of\nGovernment funds, but it's for the benefit of the\nGovernment. And for this reason --\nQUESTION: So that would be covered by the CDA.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't believe it necessarily\nwould because it doesn't involve the expenditure of\nGovernment funds. It's still private contractors coming\nin and being -- and paying the Government for the\nopportunity to do that.\nBut as far as the benefit goes, I think agencies\nhave a direct interest in providing benefits to their\nemployees and especially in the PX example because PX's,\nfor example, are basically a fringe benefit for servicemen\nand women and their dependents in that it's -- it's --\nbasically access is limited to them. And salary and\nfringe benefits of that sort are how agencies procure\nemployees. That is how they attract and retain qualified\npersonnel. And in fact, agencies have drawn a distinction\nbetween benefits provided to employees and benefits\nprovided to the entire public --\nQUESTION: But isn't that the --\nQUESTION: You'd say -- it still isn't covered,\nyou say, unless the Government pays out cash. Is that\nright?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that that would be the\nbetter view, but I think obviously a stronger argument\ncould be made for concessioners.\nQUESTION: Well, why did you say it was not in\nthe legislative history in that respect? What -- what is\nthis? You -- you quote in your brief -- I just want a\nlittle clarification. There's a committee report. The\nSenate report says that, quote, concessions contracts do\nnot constitute contracts for the procurement of goods and\nservices for the benefit of the Government or otherwise.\nAnd -- and there's something odd about that statement, but\nI got it out of -- you quoted it. And that seems to be\nthe legislative history of the act, and apparently it\nisn't. Where -- what's -- what's the status of that\nparticular remark?\nMR. ELWOOD: No. Those are both the -- those\nare committee reports --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ELWOOD: -- for the 1998 act. So it's part\nof the legislative history.\nQUESTION: So why isn't that legislative\nhistory?\nMR. ELWOOD: Oh, it is -- it is -- I don't\nknow that I understand your question.\nQUESTION: It says concessions contracts are not\ncontracts for procurement of goods and services.\nMR. ELWOOD: Oh. I was addressing the -- the\nlegislative history of the CDA, not the 1998 act.\nQUESTION: Well, is -- aren't we concerned --\noh, the 1998 act is which? That's the --\nMR. ELWOOD: That is the act -- the current\nconcession authority, the current authority under which\nthe National Park Service issues concession contracts.\nQUESTION: So what we have is in that act --\nQUESTION: That was an act that said they're --\nQUESTION: Yes, I see. I see.\nQUESTION: -- they're not continuously renewed\nwith the same --\nMR. ELWOOD: That's correct. It eliminated\nthe --\nQUESTION: -- provider. It was the act that\nsaid, but we're going to terminate these things.\nMR. ELWOOD: That's correct.\nQUESTION: When did the Park Service first\ninstall this -- when did it first take this position? It\nwasn't just under the regulations, as I understand it.\nWhen did the Park Service take the position that\nconcession contracts were not procurement contracts?\nMR. ELWOOD: The first time they took that\nposition publicly was in 1979 in a Board of Contract\nAppeals case, Yosemite Park & Curry Company. The court --\nthe IBCA, rather, did not address it, though, because it\nwas actually before the effective date of the CDA, and\nthey took it specifically with respect to the CDA there.\nBut traditionally -- although it's impossible because of\nabsence of institutional memory, traditionally concession\ncontracts have not been viewed as procurement contracts by\nthe National Park Service.\nQUESTION: But they --\nQUESTION: You indicated that there's a stronger\nargument in some instances than in others for the fact\nthat it's a concession. A concession contract can be a\nprocurement contract. Does that go back to our basic\nquestion about ripeness and we don't know what we're\ninvolved with here? Or can we take these contracts where,\nI take it, they did involve the construction of facilities\nat national parks, et cetera, which does benefit the\nGovernment in the long term?\nMR. ELWOOD: Well, to the extent that the Court\nthinks that the specific terms of concession contracts and\nwhat is accomplished under them affects the determination\nof whether or not they're procurements, I think that the\nCourt would have some difficulty in saying authoritatively\nwhether they all are or an unacceptably high portion of\nthem are procurement contracts without having a better\nidea of what is included with them.\nIf I could --\nQUESTION: But if -- on a case-by-case basis,\nthen that would indicate the regulation is deficient\nbecause the regulation doesn't purport to -- to use\nthis -- this kind of fine distinction.\nMR. ELWOOD: But still it -- it's something that\ncould be addressed in as-applied challenges where you\ncould say, in my particular case, where it requires me to\nbuild a lodge or whatever, this is a procurement contract,\nand under those circumstances it would be very clear\nexactly what was required of the procurement contractor.\nAnd they could -- they could -- of the concessions\ncontractor and they could determine whether or not that\nparticular contract was a procurement.\nQUESTION: The regulation -- the regulation\nwould then be invalid to that extent.\nMR. ELWOOD: Yes, but the Court has held -- this\nCourt has indicated in INS versus National Center for\nImmigrants' Rights, Babbitt versus Sweet Home, and cases\nlike that that -- that merely because a regulation is\ninvalid in some applications, it will not be invalidated\non a facial basis.\nIf I could just address specifically --\nQUESTION: Mr. Elwood, is there anyplace we\ncould look to see how much pre-judgment interest the Park\nService has had to pay each year? Is it a big-ticket\nitem?\nMR. ELWOOD: It's not a big-ticket item. The\nonly three cases in which the -- the CDA has been applied\nto national park concessions are the three IBCA cases\nmentioned, and in two of those, the Government wound up\nwinning on the merits, so there was no pre-judgment\ninterest paid. So it's only in that R&R Enterprises case\nthat the Government would have paid any pre-judgment\ninterest in this case.\nIf I could just go to your example, Justice\nKennedy, about the building of buildings on national\nparklands. I believe that is not a procurement for -- for\na variety of reasons. First, just as a statistical\nmatter, 78 percent of concessions contracts do not involve\nany capital improvements.\nIt's much broader than just structures. It's structures,\nunremovable property, and fixtures.\nBut on the merits, many concessions contractors\nhave been required, since the very beginning of the --\nof -- of concessions, 1872, to require -- they've been\nrequired to build their own buildings. And historically\nthat has not been considered something that the Government\ngets. It doesn't get the benefit of those services\nbecause it enters the contracts not for purposes of\ngetting a building, but because it wishes to have\nconcessioners provide services to park visitors. And in\norder to do that, it tolerates the building. The National\nPark Service doesn't want buildings in the parks. It\nwants nature in the parks, and it tolerates the buildings\nto the extent that they are used to provide visitor\nservices. And I think this comes across in the way these\nare treated by the contract.\nEven though the Government has bare title in\nthese buildings, in a very real sense it doesn't buy them.\nEvery concessioner who builds a building in the national\nparks under a concessions agreement will have a leasehold\nsurrender interest equal to the construction cost of the\nbuilding plus inflation minus depreciation. And they\ncannot be put out of that building by anyone until they\nare paid that leasehold surrender interest; that is, until\nthe building essentially is bought. As long as a\nconcessioner is operating out of that building, a\nconcessioner will hold the leasehold surrender interest,\nnot the Government.\nAlso, I think it's telling that the form\ncontract indicates that if the concessioner ever leaves\nthe -- ever abandons the building, ever -- that they have\nconstructed, that the Government can require them to knock\nit down and restore the site to its natural -- its natural\nstate. That's section 9b of the standard contract and in\nthe contract that it's in the joint appendix. So again,\nthat's an indication that they're not interested really in\nprocuring the construction services. They're interested\nin authorizing a concessioner to provide services to\nvisitors to the national parks.\nFinally, I think it's noteworthy that Congress\nobviously knew that concessioners would be building\nbuildings under the 1998 act, which was enacted against\nthe backdrop of this regulation setting forth the Park\nService's consistently held view that concessions\ncontracts are not procurement contracts. And far from\ndisplacing that view, they actually seem to embrace it\nboth in the text of the act and in the legislative history\nthat Justice Breyer mentioned.\nAs far as the text of the act goes, I think it's\ntelling that -- the different types of language they use\nfor both the concessions side of the house and the\nprocurement side of the house. On the concessions side,\nthey use distinct language that I don't think you're going\nto find in any procurement statute anywhere. Instead of\nsaying procure or purchase, they say they -- the -- the\nPark Service can authorize concessioners to provide\nservices, and it even specifies that the services will not\nbe provided to the Government. It says they're provided\nto visitors, which is obviously very different from\nprocurement statutes, many of which specifically state\nthat the service will be provided to the agency.\nQUESTION: Maybe the Park Service wrote that\nportion of the committee report.\nMR. ELWOOD: No. That -- Justice -- Justice\nScalia, that's the actual text of the statute.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ELWOOD: And by contrast with that, the\nactual text of the procurement provisions of the 1998 --\nsection 5959, used typical procurement language and\nspecified that the Park Service will be benefitting from\nit. It says that the -- that the service can enter into\nmanagement consultant agreements whereby management\nconsultants provide services to assist the Secretary in\nadministering the program.\nthink in both ways.\nFinally, one other thing that I think is telling\nis that Congress specifically provided that some of the\nmost likely to arise disputes under the act, including\nspecifically franchise-free disputes, which I think people\nwould think would -- would arise frequently, would be\nsubject to mandatory arbitration. And if Congress had\nthought there was an administrative remedy for this under\nthe CDA, I just don't think there would be any need for\nthem to provide for an -- a mandatory arbitral remedy.\nQUESTION: Mr. Elwood, is the petitioner right\nin saying that -- that when the Government sell goods --\nsells goods, that comes under the CDA?\nMR. ELWOOD: That is correct. Under 602(a)(4),\nthe -- when the Government disposes of property that is\nnot -- when the Government -- Government disposes of\npersonal property, those sales are covered by the CDA.\nHowever, petitioner has never raised that theory in this\nCourt -- in any court.\nQUESTION: Those are not procurement contracts,\nare they?\nMR. ELWOOD: No, but they -- they don't purport\nto be. If you look at the CDA, the word procurement is\nalways used in the clause for procurement of services,\nprocurement of construction, repair.\ntacked on at the end basically because GSA at the time\nsubjected sales contracts to the same dispute clause, that\nwas problematic, that procurement contracts were. But\nthat still -- in order to get coverage under the CDA under\npetitioner's theory, they still must be a procurement\ncontract or must involve the procurement of services.\nIf there are no further questions from the\nCourt.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Elwood.\nMr. Geller, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe complaint -- the complaint in this case was\nfiled under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 1491(b). The Court\nwill find that at page 13 of the joint appendix. And\nthat -- that statute provides for district court\njurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to the terms of\nproposed Government contracts. And I think if you look at\nparagraph 62 and 114 of the joint -- of the complaint,\nwhich is in the joint appendix, you'll see the allegations\nthat were made in the complaint to fall within that\nprovision of -- of title 28.\nAs to the substance of the CDA claim, the\nGovernment makes much of the fact that no, quote,\nGovernment funds were used here. And I cannot stress\nenough that that is a phrase that they've invented for the\npurposes of this case. It makes much of the fact that the\nconcessioners received monies here from the visitors to\nthe national park, remit some of it to the NPS as a\nfranchise fee, and keep the rest of it. But these\ncontracts could just have easily been structured so that\nthe NPS got all the money in the first instance, kept some\nof it as a franchise fee, and paid the rest of it back to\nthe concessioners. And in fact, some Government\nconcessions contracts are written that way. In that case,\neven the Government, I think, would have to concede that\nGovernment funds were used. We can't believe that the CDA\ncoverage of the CDA, these important procedural and\nsubstantive protections, turns on such flimsy\ndeterminations as to who gets the money in the first\ninstance.\nNow, secondly, we -- we've already talked about\nthe fact that so many services are being provided here\nthat are for the use and benefit of the Government, as\nwell as for the visitors of the national parks.\nBut I also want to point out that the Government\nis the sole beneficiary of the contractual provisions in\nvirtually every concessions contract requiring the\nconstruction, repair, and maintenance of facilities in the\nnational parks. You know, if the Court will look, for\nexample, at page 96 of the joint appendix, which is a -- a\nprovision of the Grand Canyon contract that's in the\nrecord, you'll see there that this contract -- under this\nthe contract, the NPS is there procuring maintenance,\nrepair, housekeeping, and groundskeeping for all\nconcessions facilities. It seems to us if you look at the\nlanguage of that -- of that procurement and compare it to\nsection 3(a)(3) of the CDA, which -- which provides that\nCDA coverage for contracts for the procurement of\nconstruction or repair or maintenance of real property,\nit's impossible to conclude, I think, that this\nprocurement contract doesn't fall within the CDA.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Geller.\nThe Court wishes supplemental briefs on the\nissue of ripeness, simultaneous briefs, due 3:00 p.m.\nFriday.\n"
