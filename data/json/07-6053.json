        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-6053, Giles versus California.\nMs. Burkhardt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BURKHARDT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nIn Crawford this Court made clear that in\norder to determine the scope of the Confrontation Clause\nwe look to the common law and particularly as it existed\nat the time of the framing. And, as we have shown in\nour briefs, the -- California's forfeiture rule did not\nexist in common law. It did not exist at the time of\nthe framing. And the common-law concept that is\nembodied in the Confrontation Clause has grave,\npractical importance to defendants, and particularly to\nthe defendant in this case, because the application of\nthis new forfeiture rule that California created\ndeprived the Petitioner of his right to present a fair\nclaim of self-defense.\nBasically, the statement that was admitted\naccused the Petitioner of having viciously attacked\nMiss Avie and having threatened her at knifepoint and\nhaving threatened to kill her. And the admission of\nthis statement, which he never had a chance to\ncross-examine or attempt a cross-examination, obviously\nwas highly prejudicial because it indicated to the jury\nthat he was planning to kill her.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he got -- he got on\nthe stand, and he said some very nasty things about her.\nI mean he painted her as aggressive, vengeful. Isn't\nthere a legitimate rebuttal when he is painting her as\nthe aggressor, and she has given a statement that\nsuggests that he is the one who was aggressive?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the\n-- her statement came in, in the prosecution's\ncase-in-chief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But could it have come in\nas rebuttal of his testimony, the same testimony by the\npolice? Was it the police officer that --\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- took her statement?\nOkay. He gets on the stand, and he says all of these\nunpleasant things about her. And then the State says,\nokay, now we have our chance, and we are going to put in\nher statement through the testimony of the police\nofficer to rebut what he has just said.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, the difference is that\nhis statements about her went solely to his state of\nmind. They did not come in for their truth, but her\nstatements came in for their truth. So it really isn't\nan apples-and-oranges comparison.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that the\ndifference is that his statements about her were subject\nto cross-examination.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Indeed, of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And her statements about\nhim were not.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are not -- well,\nbut we are talking about the door -- the door opening\nhere at trial. Did he give notice that he was going to\ntestify in California? Do they have some rule that if\nyou're going to testify, you have to give notice?\nMS. BURKHARDT: He did indicate that he was\ngoing to present a claim of self-defense, and I believe\nhe indicated that he was going to testify.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That tends to diminish\nsomewhat, but not entirely, your, I think, quite proper\nresponse that this came in on direct not -- not cross.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, Justice Kennedy, the\nfact that it was a self-defense claim is irrelevant.\nThis testimony would have come in -- her testimony or\nhearsay statements would have come in even if he hadn't\npresented a self-defense claim. It just was a\ncoincidence in this case.\nAnd California claims that they have a right\nto introduce such testimonial statements in any case in\nwhich they can show that the defendant was the cause of\nthe witness's absence. I mean the case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe they would be wrong\n-- maybe they would be wrong in another case, but we\nhave this case, and Justice Scalia has suggested, I take\nit, that this testimony could not come in even by way of\nrebuttal.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even by way of\ncross-examination. Do you -- do you share that view?\nMS. BURKHARDT: I do. It -- it doesn't\nreally go to any of the claims --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It may go to his\ncredibility. He has just painted a picture of this\nwoman which is quite different from what her statement\nto the police officer would portray.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, the injustice here,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that he doesn't have a -- any\nmeaningful opportunity to contest what the police\nofficer says she said because he never had an\nopportunity to cross-examine her.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course -- of\ncourse, that's true. That is the reason for the\nconfrontation -- confrontation rule. But it does seem\nto me that this is responsive to his defense; and you\nsay, well, it's his state of mind, and her testimony was\ngeneral. I think it does go to his state of mind.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not following you. Is\nthere -- is there an exception to the hearsay rule so\nlong as the hearsay is brought in, in rebuttal? Is\nthere a rebuttal exception to the hearsay rule?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Not to my knowledge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking here\nabout the definition or the contours of the equitable\nrule, the forfeiture rule, for confrontation. And I\nthink perhaps what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, and\ncertainly what I was suggesting, is that when we are\nlooking at whether or not there is a forfeiture, we are\ntalking about equitable considerations.\nNow, it's true in this case we are presented\nwith an instance that I've never seen, which is that the\nmurder itself makes the declarant unavailable for\npurposes of the equitable exception. And it is true\nthat that goes much further than the common law did.\nMS. BURKHARDT: It goes much further; and,\nindeed, the State has not cited one single case at\ncommon law or after that supports its view that this\nrule is proper.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How much are we supposed to\nfollow the common law, in your opinion, as it was in the\n18th century or 12th century, or something? I mean\nsuppose, to take a fanciful example -- I mean -- but\nsuppose there was a common-law rule. And I know there\nwasn't, but suppose there was a common-law rule that\nsaid in cases involving witches you cannot admit any\nevidence because either the witch, the accused witch,\ncame up out of the water when they were dunking her,\nand, therefore, she is guilty, so there is no need; or\nshe is under water, which shows she is, you know,\nguilty, but you can't cross-examine a person under\nwater.\nNow if there were a rule like that, would we\nnow incorporate it into the Constitution of the United\nStates? The answer is meant to be no.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, let's get more\nrealistic. There are all kinds of rules --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is thinking about\nCambridge and not England.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So there are all\nkinds of rules of disqualification of witnesses in the\n17th and 18th century. You couldn't testify. In this\ncase there would have been no admission if she had been\nmarried to the man instead of being his girlfriend. You\ncouldn't have a spouse; you couldn't have an interested\nparty; you couldn't have a child who didn't understand\nthe oath; you couldn't have a person who was an atheist;\nyou couldn't have somebody who was a convicted felon.\nSo now are we supposed to incorporate all of\nthese things into the Confrontation Clause?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do any of them have\nanything to do with the Confrontation Clause?\nMS. BURKHARDT: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have to do with\nthe Confrontation Clause that you couldn't cross-examine\nperson who didn't understand the meaning of the oath?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Justice Breyer, the\nConfrontation Clause sets forth a basic policy, which is\nthat we are to have live testimony in court. We have to\nhave witnesses available in court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what about a person who\n-- the same facts that he could not -- wasn't eligible\nto testify? At common law you never could have gotten\nthat person to testify in court, no matter what. And,\ntherefore, what? That's what I'm asking, if we are\nsupposed to follow all of the contours of that rule.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, in Crawford this Court\nsaid we do look to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But, now, does\nthat make sense? For example, if this woman had been\nmarried, she could not. She -- her testimony -- whether\nyour client deliberately procured her absence,\naccidentally procured her absence, whatever he did, that\ntestimony could not have come in, is that right, if she\nwas married to him?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, that's sort of -- that\nsounds like, say, the situation in Crawford that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I think what\nJustice Breyer is saying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to drive at what\nthe contours are. Which ones do we ignore, and which\ndon't --\nMS. BURKHARDT: -- sets forth the proper\ncontours, which is that any exception to the\nConfrontation Clause must be very, very narrow. And\nthey approved an exception for witness tampering which\nis deeply embedded in the common law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think what Justice\nBreyer's line of questioning points out is that there\nwere other provisions of the evidence rule followed in\nEngland which would not allow the testimony to come in,\nin the first place. In this case, we wouldn't even have\nthe issue before us if the testimony were not admissible\nas an exception to the hearsay rule. It is admissible.\nThen we have to ask if it conforms with the\nConfrontation Clause, which is the issue we have. But\nbecause of the restrictions he points to, there was\nnever the occasion for the common law to explore the\nboundaries of the forfeiture exception in the\nconfrontation context.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And besides which, the\nquestion that Justice Breyer was asking was already\nanswered in Crawford; wasn't it?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes, it was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A case from which he\ndissented. But we did say that the meaning of the\nConfrontation Clause is the meaning it bore when the\npeople adopted it.\nMS. BURKHARDT: That is right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't think I did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a dying\ndeclaration rule at the common law; wasn't there?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes, there was.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that didn't\nrequire any inquiry into the intent of the person\nresponsible for the death, or the imminent death, right?\nMS. BURKHARDT: That's correct. But the\ndying declaration -- the fact that the dying declaration\nrule existed with its very specific elements shows\npowerfully that no general rule existed such as the\nCalifornia rule, because if the California rule had\nexisted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the dying\ndeclaration rule didn't require intent, why should\nyours?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Because the forfeiture rule\nat -- which is a separate -- entirely a separate rule of\ncommon law, did require intent to prevent testimony. It\nhas always been viewed that way from its inception in\nLord Morley's Case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Instead of intent, the\ndying declaration rule required knowledge by the\ndeclarant that the declarant was about to die.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\nMS. BURKHARDT: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the evidence of\ntruthfulness was apparently that the person was about to\nenter the next world.\nMS. BURKHARDT: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And most of us don't lie at\nthat particular moment. Whereas, in the Confrontation\nClause situation you have a totally different situation.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I joined Crawford, and\nJustice Scalia would like to kick me off the boat, which\nI'm rapidly leaving in any event, but the --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You jumped off in Crawford,\nI thought.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. But my question --\nI want to go back because what I'm finding difficult\nis -- well, let's take the specific case. Suppose they\nhad been married. If they had been married in 1789, I\nguess, or 1750, or 1400, or whenever, her testimony\nwould not have come in regardless. I think I'm right on\nthat.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes, as a spouse.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, as a spouse. And,\ntherefore, whether he procured her absence or not is\nbeside the point. Now, do we follow that rule under the\nConfrontation Clause today?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think your answer was\nthat in Crawford that was the situation. It was a\nspouse; wasn't it?\nMS. BURKHARDT: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Crawford.\nMS. BURKHARDT: In Crawford it was a spouse.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was the defendant\nwho said he didn't want her to testify.\nMS. BURKHARDT: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the -- the\ntestimony of someone who heard her say something, was\nthat admissible?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Under -- under Crawford?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. Under the\ncommon law.\nMS. BURKHARDT: I don't think it was.\nHearsay was absolutely inadmissible. And there were\njust very, very narrow exceptions under the common law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Like in the case of\nan unavailable witness?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Of course. Especially in\nthe case of an unavailable witness. In Lord Morley's\ncase they set forth rules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are some things\nthat are not just testimonial. For example, suppose she\nleft a sealed letter. She has been murdered, and the\nletter is to be opened only upon her death, and the\nletter says: If I was done in, go after him. Could\nthat come into evidence?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it\ndepends on whether it was deemed to be testimonial or\nnot.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is it? I'm just\ngiving you --\nMS. BURKHARDT: It's not an issue in our\ncase. I mean perhaps. I mean obviously, as you point\nout, if she had made a statement to a -- not a police\nofficer -- to a friend, family member, or whatever, a\nnontestimonial statement, then that probably could come\nin. But what is at issue here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what's the line\nbetween what -- I understand that she is accusing him to\na police officer.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say that's\ntestimonial.\nMS. BURKHARDT: The courts --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If she is talking to a\nfriend and saying that she is scared to death of this\nman --\nMS. BURKHARDT: That is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the friend could\ntestify?\nMS. BURKHARDT: That's perhaps\nnontestimonial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference?\nIf this rule is going to separate the testimonial from\nthe nontestimonial, you have to be able to tell when\nit's one and when it's the other.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, the Court hasn't fully\ndescribed all of the parameters of \"testimonial.\" But\nour case does not involve that issue, because this\nstatement is clearly testimonial.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you whether\nthere is really anything involved in this case? Both\nthe California Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals\nsaid it is inconceivable that any rational trier of fact\nwould have concluded that the shooting was excusable or\njustifiable.\nDoesn't that virtually guarantee that if\nthere was an error here, it was harmless error?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, no, not necessarily.\nI think it's very significant that the court of\nappeals -- neither the California Supreme Court nor the\nCourt of Appeals engaged in a harmless-error analysis.\nAnd that statement that you quote presupposed that the\ntestimonial hearsay statement at issue was a large\nfactor in coming to that conclusion. So, you know, no,\nI don't think it's necessary. That really went --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. No. Is that correct?\nWeren't they concluding that, based on the independent\nevidence, it was virtually inconceivable --\nMS. BURKHARDT: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMS. BURKHARDT: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know in\nthis case that part of his intent was not to prevent her\nfrom testifying at trial? I mean, it's obvious that he\nwas upset about something else, but maybe in his mind he\nis saying, oh, boy, if she has talked to people about\nhow I'm going to kill her, I'd better do it so that she\ncan't testify.\nMS. BURKHARDT: There was a specific finding\nof fact by the court of appeals that he did not intend\nto kill her -- he did not kill her to prevent testimony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How are we ever\ngoing to know that in a typical case?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, by, you know,\nanalyzing the evidence. I mean, obviously, there are\nmany ways, and perhaps he made a statement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, take a case\nlike this, I don't understand how that finding could\nhave been made. He knew that she had reported -- that\nshe had said to her friends he is going to kill me; he\nis going to kill me. And then he figures he'd better do\nit or it's going to -- his self-defense claim is going\nto look a lot weaker.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, that -- I think, Mr.\nChief Justice, that doesn't make an awful lot of sense\nbecause that indicates that he killed her in order to\nprevent her from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm sorry it\ndoesn't. It means that that may have been part of his\nmotive, to kill her. Because I'm not just going to beat\nher up this time; I'm actually going to kill her because\notherwise I'm going up the river. Here he gets a great\nbenefit from murdering her which is that her testimony\nis not available. We usually under our system don't try\nto give benefits to murderers.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, first of all, the\ncourt of appeals specifically found that he did not kill\nher to prevent testimony. The California Supreme Court\nbasically adopted that finding --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that,\nand you've said --\nMS. BURKHARDT: -- and the State never\nchallenged it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me, Counsel.\nYou've said that already. And what I'm saying is that I\ndon't understand under the legal standard we might\nadopt, how that sort of finding makes sense. I mean,\nyou don't ask him why did you kill her; was it to\nprevent her testimony or not? That's not available in\nthe inquiry. So how can that sort of factual finding be\nmade?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, the courts have\nbeen -- Federal and State courts have been making that\nfactual finding for -- for decades under the Federal\nrule, and under the Carlson line of cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- here it's his\nown murder trial. So he didn't murder her so that she\ncouldn't be a witness at the trial for her murder.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he might have\nmurdered her because she had good grounds to get him\nindicted on criminal assault charges. Maybe he murdered\nher so that she would not be available to testify at\nsuch a trial.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, that's highly\nspeculative. There was no proceeding. There was no\nindication in the record that -- that her assault claim\nwas ever going to ripen into any kind of criminal\nproceeding at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I had thought that the\ncommon law rule is that you have to have rendered the --\nintentionally rendered the witness unavailable with\nregard to the particular trial that's before the court.\nNot rendering the witness unavailable for some other\nlitigation.\nMS. BURKHARDT: That was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any case\nwhere it was some other litigation that --\nMS. BURKHARDT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so.\nMS. BURKHARDT: No. That is the common law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- let's assume that\nthe only case on the books pre-1789 was Morley, in which\nthe defendant did specifically intend to keep the\nwitness away from the trial. But let's assume, contrary\nto fact, that the Morley case gave a -- a very sweeping,\nexpansive definition of the equitable forfeiture rule\nand said the defendant cannot profit by his own wrong.\nCould we take that general language pre-1789\nand say that it supports the rule today, assuming we\ncould find that in the Morley case or other aspects of\nthe common law? Or would we be just confined, as you\nunderstand Crawford, to the specific holding of Morton\nthat there has to be a specific intent?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, the hypothetical\nassumes something which is -- which Your Honor admits is\n-- is simply not the case. I'm going to suppose\nassuming --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Please -- please make the\nsupposition.\nMS. BURKHARDT: -- that it was there, I\nsuppose the Court could -- could rule on the basis of\nthat, but that it's definitely not the case and has\nnever been the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, suppose\nwe read the English authorities that it does not\nforeclose the expansion of the equitable forfeiture\nrule.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, I -- I think the\nEnglish authorities do foreclose it, because the dying\ndeclaration cases, and there are dozens of them, would\nnot have come out as they did if this expansive\nforfeiture rule had existed. It would make no sense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I find that difficult\nto understand because the dying declaration rule came up\nin many instances when the confrontation rule was not\ninvolved at all.\nMS. BURKHARDT: That's right. But with\nthis -- but the point I'm making is this: that under\nCalifornia's theory, if the defendant is -- causes the\nabsence of the witness, and all you need to show is\ncausation, then the witness's testimonial statement will\ncome in; but under the dying declaration rule mere\ncausation is not sufficient. You have to also show\nother factors in very -- particularly that the -- that\nthe witness was aware of impending death.\nThat requirement is totally superfluous\nunder the California theory; and yet it -- the fact that\nno lawyer or no judge for hundreds of years ever\nsuggested that in those cases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your dying declaration\ncases are not just murders, though.\nMS. BURKHARDT: They are just murders.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pardon me?\nMS. BURKHARDT: They are just murders, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? I thought they\ncame in, in civil cases all the time.\nMS. BURKHARDT: The ones we cite are murders\nand they are murder cases in criminal cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- I agree --\nI'll check the, -- check --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the rationale for the\ndying declaration rule has nothing to do with who caused\nthe death.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, you know, it\nspecifically goes to -- the element of the dying\ndeclaration is that the statement has to relate to the\nspecific cause of the death. So it really does.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it has to be imminent,\ntoo.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, the death doesn't have\nto be imminent specifically.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He has to think it's\nimminent.\nMS. BURKHARDT: But the perception is -- the\ndeclarant has to believe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's an entirely\ndifferent rationale from the issue we have here, because\nit applies across the board to civil cases and all sorts\nof litigation.\nMS. BURKHARDT: It applies powerfully in\nmany, many instances to criminal cases; and that fact --\nand that has existed for -- for centuries -- shows that\nthere was no general rule that all, you know, needed to\ndo was to be accused of murdering the victim; because\notherwise if California rule had existed, there would be\nno need to make this other showing in the dying\ndeclaration cases.\nAnd in many cases, as we have cited in our\nbrief and as the NACDL has cited, evidence -- important\nevidence was kept out. Testimonial hearsay accusations\nwere kept out -- from the victim accusing the defendant\nwere kept out because they didn't meet the specific\nrequirements, specifically the sense of impending death.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the forfeiture rule is\ndesigned to suspend the operation of the confrontation\nrule. That doesn't mean that it comes in. You still\nneed another hearsay exception which will allow it in.\nMS. BURKHARDT: Well, not under the common\nlaw. It was -- it was one rule under the common law.\nIt was only later that it operated as two separate rules\nof confrontation and a hearsay rule. Under the common\nlaw all you needed to show was the dying declaration,\nthen it was admissible for all purposes. There was no\ndistinction between confrontation and hearsay at that\ntime.\nAnd so therefore, again -- it just -- if all\nyou needed to show was that the defendant caused or\nlikely caused the absence or killed the victim, then all\nof those cases went the wrong way; all of that evidence,\nthe victim's accusations, would have come in --\nautomatically. And they did not come in; in case after\ncase we have showed that. We have cited some dozens of\ncases that show that. And the State has not cited even\none single case, not one, which shows at common law that\nthis evidence here would have come in.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time\nif there are no more questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Burkhardt.\nMr. De Nicola.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. De NICOLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI think I want to start off by correcting, I\nthink, the impression that the common law ever stated a\nrule that intent to tamper was a prerequisite for\nkeeping out the evidence of a -- of a victim of a\nmurderer. And I don't think this Court, in the Reynolds\ncase, has ever -- or in the subsequent cases, has ever\nstated such a rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it didn't put it in\nthose very words, but I think a lot of -- of the\nquotations from opinions cited by your friend seemed to\nme to say that.\nBut why don't you start off by telling -- by\nexplaining to us why these many cases excluded the dying\ndeclaration of the murdered person when -- if it could\nnot be shown that the murdered person knew when the\ndeclaration was made that he or she was dying? If the\nrule that you're announcing was the rule at common law,\nall of those would have come in because that declaration\nsaid this Defendant killed me. And, therefore, it would\nhave been true in all of those cases that this defendant\nprocured the absence of the witness from the trial. How\ndo you explain that.\nAnd there are many cases. It's not just a\nfew. The requirement in the dying declaration cases\nthat the -- that the declarant be aware of impending\ndeath is uniform. Why even bother with that requirement\nif it could all come in under -- under this procurement\nof the absence-of-the-witness rule?\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, I think, as Justice\nKennedy's question suggested, that there are different\nelements to -- that need to be surpassed before the\ndying declaration would come in.\nWhat happens in the dying declaration\nsituation, Your Honor, is that there is no validation or\nvindication of the defendant's cross-examination rights;\nand that's what we are interested in here today: How\nthe common law would have treated the cross-examination\nright of a defendant who killed a witness. The dying\ndeclaration rule certainly cabins the admissibility of\ndying declarations for reliability reasons, but it did\nnot detract from the fact that the evidence of the dying\ndeclaration came in peculiarly when the defendant killed\nthe victim of the crime, the witness whose testimony was\ncoming in.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure you've\nanswered my question. Why wasn't it enough for the\nprosecution to say: This dying person said that this\ndefendant killed her; therefore, this declaration can\ncome in because this defendant procured the absence of\nthis declarant by killing her?\nMR. De NICOLA: It wouldn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nobody even ever makes\nthose arguments. They fight it out on whether the\ndeclarant was aware of impending death or not, but that\nwould have been totally irrelevant if it all comes in\nunder -- under the rule that you're arguing for here.\nMR. De NICOLA: No, because under the rule\nI'm arguing for, and why the prosecutor wouldn't have\nsucceeded in making that argument, the rule I'm arguing\nfor is simply that in the situation where the defendant\nkills the witness the common law did not recognize, or\nthere is no strong case authority that would indicate\nthat the common law would recognize, a confrontation\nright with respect to that defendant against his\nwitness's statement.\nNevertheless, the common law puts some other\nnonconfrontation restrictions on the admissibility of\nthe dying declaration. Those were reliability-based\nrestrictions. Reliability-based restrictions can't\ndetermine the scope of the confrontation right.\nUnder Crawford, the confrontation right is a\nseparate process that has to be adhered to and can't be\nsubstituted with another reliability-assessment machine\nunless there is a rule that would have let that\nstatement in that doesn't depend on a reliability\nassessment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand the\ndistinction you're drawing at the present time or at\nleast since the Bill of Rights was adopted. We have two\nregimes. We have the constitutional condition and we\nhave hearsay rules.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But with respect to the\ncommon law as it stood at the time that the Bill of\nRights was adopted, there wasn't such a distinction; was\nthere? In other words, to the extent that the\nconfrontation right is informed by the common- law\nantecedent, the common-law antecedents were not drawing\nthe line that you are drawing; were they?\nMR. De NICOLA: I think that's right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if that is the case,\nthen it seems to me you haven't answered Justice\nScalia's question. Because Justice Scalia's question\nsays: Let's just talk about common-law antecedents for\na moment; and, given common-law antecedents, why were\npeople worried about the consciousness of death under\nthe dying declaration rule if there was this broader\nrule which is supposed to inform our understanding of\nthe confrontation right, which would have let it in\nsimply because the crime had forfeited the right to\nobject. And it seems to me that you still have not\nanswered his question.\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, let me -- let me take\na different tack. Under the common-law rule, if the\ndefendant killed the witness and the witness's statement\nmet the dying declaration criteria, that statement would\ncome in against the defendant. But if the defendant\nkilled the same victim and you had another witness who\nwitnessed the crime and made a dying declaration that\nqualified under the rule, that dying declaration\ndescribing the defendant's infliction of the mortal\nblow, that dying declaration would not have come in.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If it was -- if it was\ntestimony. There are a lot of declarations that are not\ntestimonial, and the rule is very important for those.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are also\ndeclarations that are testimonial, in which case we look\nto the confrontation concept.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes, but I think -- but I\nthink, with respect to testimonial statements, it -- I\nthink it gives you an insight into what the common law\nwould have done with respect to the alleged\nconfrontation rights of the murderer against the victim\nto know that when the defendant murdered the victim, the\nvictim's dying declaration came in without regard to\nconfrontation.\nIt might not have been excluded because it\nmight not have met other criteria, but it would have\ncome in without confrontation. And it would have come\nin without confrontation in a way that the -- the mere\nwitness who makes a dying declaration and witnesses the\nsame crime would not have come in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose that\nthere are a lot, a lot of situations in which a dead\nvictim has made statements pertinent to the murder. So\nwouldn't your rule drive a pretty big hole through\nCrawford?\nThis is not an isolated instance where the\nvictim said something about the murderer. That would\nseem to be a fairly common situation, because most\nmurders involve people who know each other.\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, I think it would -- it\n-- I think it would, it would apply in murder cases with\nrespect to the statements of the victim. So I think the\n-- I think the application of the forfeiture rule on a\nmurder basis as we are suggesting here, yes, I think it\nwould --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But to the extent that\nCrawford is confined simply to testimonial statements,\nany number of statements --\nMR. De NICOLA: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that will come in under\nthe California evidence rule are simply not controlled\nby the Confrontation Clause anyway. It's just -- it's a\nstandard hearsay problem.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes. Like the California\nSupreme Court recognized, and it was buttressed, I\nthink, by this Court's decision in Davis, simply because\nthe defendant might forfeit his confrontation rights\nbecause he murders the victim, that doesn't necessarily\nmean that he forfeits his other hearsay- rule\nprotections or his other constitutional-reliability\nprotections or his right to impeach the hearsay\ndeclarations of the unavailable witness or his right to\ncontradict them or his right --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that mean, what you\njust said, that this is not a problem in States that\nhave adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence? Because, as\nI understand it, there is an exception, the standard\nexception, for when the defendant procures the witness's\nabsence for the very purpose of preventing the witness\nfrom testifying at a particular trial. That's the\nexception that's in the Federal Rules of Evidence. You\ndon't have an exception, a hearsay exception, for just\nbeing responsible for the witness's unavailability.\nSo practically, this couldn't come in under\na hearsay objection in places that have the Federal\nRules of Evidence; is that right?\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes. If the Federal rule\nwere interpreted to require the intent to tamper, in any\njurisdiction that decided as a matter of their own\nhearsay policy that they wanted to govern the\nadmissibility of evidence along those lines, then, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't it have to be\ninterpreted that way? You don't contend it could be\ninterpreted differently?\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, I don't know exactly\nwhether the Federal rule has uniformly been -- been\ninterpreted to require a specific intent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just because it says so, I\nmean.\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, there is -- I don't\nthink -- for example, I don't think there is a Federal\ncase that's been cited where the forfeiture has been\ndenied in a situation where the defendant murdered the\nwitness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you give us one case\nfrom the common law, just one, in which the procurement\nof a witness's absence exception to the Confrontation\nClause was applied where there was no intent to prevent\nthe witness from testifying?\nMR. De NICOLA: I don't -- I don't think I\nhave the case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you do\neither.\nMR. De NICOLA: -- that -- that applied the\nrule. But I don't think there is a case that\narticulated the rule in a way that would have limited\nits application.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason, I think, is --\nI think, if I understand Justice Scalia's question, take\nordinary hearsay?\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. There's a reason for\nkeeping it out, though there are many exceptions. Now\ntake that subset of ordinary hearsay where it was a\nstatement made purposefully to go to trial. Now there\nis especially good reason for keeping it out, so like a\ndouble reason. And I think he finds it odd that we,\nunder the common law, putting us back then, would say\nthere's an exception where there's especially good\nreason for keeping it out, see, in the testimonial case,\nan exception where you go get the person murdered, but\nyou didn't do it purposefully. But -- but there is no\nexception in just where there's only the ordinary reason\nfor keeping it out. It should seem to work the other\nway around.\nNow, to me that suggests that maybe we\nshouldn't follow completely the common law as it evolved\nin evidentiary principles. Maybe we have to assume an\nintent to allow the contours of the Confrontation Clause\nto evolve as the law of evidence itself evolves.\nOtherwise, we get caught up in these logical\ncontradictions. What do you think of that?\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, I think that -- I\nthink that we can certainly take account, for example,\nof situations that the common law might not have faced\nor might not have recognized as representing a problem\nof relevant evidence to a crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't want us to get\ncaught up in the limitations of the Confrontation\nClause?\nMR. De NICOLA: No, I'm not saying that,\nYour Honor. What I'm saying is that I think that,\nalthough the Confrontation Clause under Crawford would\nbe accepted under the governing common-law rule at the\ntime, the governing common-law rule at the time included\nthis forfeiture doctrine, and the forfeiture doctrine I\nthink has been recognized -- has been based on the maxim\nand the principle that no one may profit from\nwrongdoing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you see what my question\nwas? My question is the same question I asked your\nfellow counsel. My question is, since I led you to the\npoint where you were willing to say maybe there is some\nflexibility here, what? That's where I'm having the\ntrouble. What precisely are the principles I should\nfollow to prevent my going back to look at they dunked\nwitches, but allowing the heart of Crawford to be\nmaintained. How do I do it?\nI don't know if you can answer that\nquestion, but that's the problem that I'm having.\nMR. De NICOLA: Well, again, I think -- I\nthink the resort to the -- to the maxim and the\nequitable principles that we know that common law\nsubscribed to and that common law subscribed to those\nprinciples in this precise -- as a rule to decide how to\nresolve this particular kind of issue where the\ndefendant's wrongdoing makes the witness unavailable,\nthat the -- that because the common law accepted this\nmaxim, that we can -- we can look and apply those\nprinciples to the situation even though there might not\nhave been the precise common-law case an all fours.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the record show what\nhappened after the police went and received the\nstatements by Ms. Avie? Did she ask -- did she ask to\nhave charges brought? Did the police file a complaint?\nMR. De NICOLA: The record doesn't show,\nYour Honor. The record doesn't show.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As far as the record shows,\nnothing happened? They took this statement and that was\nit?\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes, yes, in terms of --\nbecause that was a description of the event that led to\nthe admissibility of the statement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record show or\ndid the trial indicate anything that he told the police\non the prior occasion? They went into different rooms\nand they each gave statements?\nMR. De NICOLA: No. No. No. But -- but to\nthe extent that this is a case where the -- the crime\noccurs after there had been this prior report to an\nofficial, this case is somewhat closer to the witness\ntampering scenario that my opponent says characterized\nthe admissibility of these cases at common law. So it's\nnot -- it wouldn't be a -- a departure from the theory\nthat they are proposing to recognize that in this\nsituation it's -- it's essentially similar.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it's an\nastonishingly broad exception you're asking for. On the\nother hand, testimonial statements are all that's\ninvolved, and so that's a narrow class, and maybe that\nbalances out. I'm not sure.\nBut may I just ask and you can comment on it\nif you -- may I ask: The defendant gave notice that he\nwould testify?\nMR. De NICOLA: Prior to trial, there was a\ndiscussion about what sort of defense he was going to be\nputting on, and he clearly indicated --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: California law requires\nthat?\nMR. De NICOLA: No. No. It just --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or it does not require it?\nMR. De NICOLA: It doesn't require that. It\njust -- it happened that, in discussing the\nadmissibility of all this other evidence he wanted to\nbring in to put words in the mouth of the victim, the\ncourt inquired about how that would be linked up to the\ndefense of self-defense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nMR. De NICOLA: And that's why the\ndefendant's lawyer indicated that the client would be\ntestifying and putting on -- putting on a defense of\nself-defense.\nNow, I think if you look at the -- if you\nlook at the maxim, the logic or the rational of the\nforfeiture rule, it doesn't admit of any exception for\nmotive to tamper. The motive-to-tamper rule that my\nopponent is proffering here I think is alien to the\nrationale of the maxim. The maxim is that no one shall\nprofit from wrongdoing. The superimposition of an\nintent requirement or a motive requirement wouldn't\nchange the fact that, with that intent or without the\nintent, there would be the same profit from the\nwrongdoing. There would be the same damage to the\nintegrity of the criminal trial because the\ntruth-finding function of the criminal trial would be\ndamaged by allowing the wrongdoing to be used as the\nbasis for keeping out the statement of the -- of the\nwitness, of the victim of the crime, and allowing the\ndefendant to substitute in its stead his own one-sided\nor half-true version of the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the unavailability\nis caused by the defendant's negligence. Defendant\nnegligently runs over the victim.\nMR. De NICOLA: I think if that were --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean over the declarant.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes. I think if that were a\ncrime, certainly, I think it would clearly satisfy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it's negligence.\nMR. De NICOLA: If it's mere negligence? If\nit's mere negligence, certainly that's a -- that's a\ntougher call, and it might be that in a situation of\nnoncriminal conduct the intent to tamper conceivably\ncould play a role in elevating that conduct to the kind\nof wrongdoing that would trigger the rule. But I think\nas long as you have criminal conduct and certainly where\nyou have a murder, the rule would be triggered and the\n-- the inquiry would then be whether or not there was\ncausation and whether or not there would be this profit.\nAnd the intent to tamper doesn't really relate to the\npurpose of the rule to prevent the profiting.\nSo you have the same profit, the same damage\nto the criminal justice system, and the same prejudice\nto the State, which is denied the live testimony of the\nvictim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there a problem\nthat was brought out in the briefs with -- this man is\nstanding trial before a jury that's going to determine\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if this testimony\nis going to come in, the judge has to make some kind of\na preliminary finding that he killed her in advance of\nthe jury making that determination.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes, Your Honor. And that\nhappened -- that didn't happen in this case, so that\nwould be, I think, the template for what would happen in\nfuture cases. One I think preliminary point is that in\nthe California Supreme Court, Giles essentially conceded\nthat the forfeiture rule, when it was otherwise\napplicable, does apply in the case where you have the\nwrongdoing being the same crime that's charged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's a fault, it's a\nfault that also exists with the rule being argued by\nyour opponent, isn't it?\nMR. De NICOLA: I think that's true, Your\nHonor. And it's also -- it's not -- it's not unlike the\nway a Federal court would have a foundational hearing to\nmake a preliminary determination about the admissibility\nof a co-conspirator's hearsay statement in a case where\nthe crime charged is conspiracy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe I have to take that\nback. Maybe it -- it's very -- it would be very unusual\nthat someone would kill a victim in order to prevent her\ntestifying at a murder trial which is not yet in\nprospect because you haven't murdered her. So these\ncases may be very rare. So maybe that is an advantage\nof her rule over yours, that you would very rarely have\nto find the defendant guilty of the very crime for which\nhe's being prosecuted in order to apply the -- the\nexception to the Confrontation Clause.\nMR. De NICOLA: I think it -- I think it\nwould be rare.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. De NICOLA: But -- but it's not -- but\nit's not unheard of, and there is -- there is a pedigree\nfor it, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would be rare on her\ntheory; it wouldn't be rare on yours. It happens all\nthe time on yours, I would think.\nMR. De NICOLA: But nevertheless I think the\n-- the idea that you could have the hearing even though\nit's the same issue that goes before the jury, I think\nis not an obstacle to applying the rule in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would think these cases\ncome in -- this problem comes in with spousal abuse.\nNow, I don't know what the numbers are, but I bet you\ncould find numbers. I suspect, but I don't know, that\nin many cases where there's a death in that kind of\nsituation, maybe it is accidental. Maybe the -- maybe\nthe man who is beating up his wife didn't really want\nher to die.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So that to me,\nI guess, suggests that that's in favor of your rule, I\nthink. Isn't it?\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes, I think it -- I think,\nagain, regardless of what defendant's intent is, the\nrule and the logic of the rule applies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so that would be true,\nwhether it was intended or whether it isn't intended.\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Whether it's -- I mean, I'm\nnot sure how to even administer even a criminal/civil\ndistinction.\nMR. De NICOLA: But I think the same, you\nknow, as was said before, the argument that what came\nin, in this case, was this damaging evidence that --\nthat undermined the defendant's self-defense claim.\nWell, that evidence would come in even under the theory\nthat intent to tamper were required for -- for the\nforfeiture, as well as under our theory.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're --\nit's certainly true that this issue would come up in\ndomestic abuse cases --\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but I'm not sure\nthat it would be at all limited. I assume you have, you\nknow, gang cases --\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- any case in which\nhave you familiarity between the victim and the\ndefendant, which, as I understand it, is the most\ntypical case, but it's not simply in any way limited to\nthe domestic abuse cases.\nMR. De NICOLA: No. It wouldn't be limited\nto the -- this case, it wouldn't be limited to the\ndomestic abuse cases, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know your rule\nwouldn't --\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but the\nsituation in which the case arises --\nMR. De NICOLA: Okay. --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- also would --\nMR. De NICOLA: No. No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- certainly not.\nIt comes up quite frequently, I would assume --\nMR. De NICOLA: In gang cases, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because you often\nhave an association with --\nMR. De NICOLA: Yes. And I think it can\ncome up in cases of -- of abuse of children, as another\nexample.\nSo I think because there's no equitable\nargument on the part of the defendant about why this\nrule, this no-profit rule, would depend on an intent to\ntamper, I think if you transport that back into the\ncommon law, the same rule and the same principles of\napplying, and you would -- you would have I think the\nsame results.\nExcuse me. I think -- again, well, I don't\nwant to repeat myself, but I guess I just want to again\nemphasize that the -- that the logic of the rule really\ndoesn't admit of an intent requirement. Nothing in this\nCourt's cases has ever dictated an intent requirement.\nNothing in the common-law cases has ever articulated an\nintent requirement, and in the common-law cases the rule\nthat we are advancing is justified by the maxim that\napplied at the common law, and it was also justified --\nwell, at least I think an insight into how common law\nwould have devalued the confrontation rights of the\nkiller against the witness can be seen in the dying\ndeclarations case. Because even though they might\nultimately have proved inadmissible on another ground,\nwhere the special criteria for the dying declaration\ncases was not met, those cases nevertheless are\ninstances where the evidence comes in against the\ndefendant where he kills the victim.\nThe slayer's cases that were recognized at\ncommon law where no intent was required before somebody\nwould be barred from receiving an inequitable\ndistribution from an insurance policy, or from a\ntestator, those cases were also decided at common law\nunder this maxim.\nAnd the ultimate -- I think the ultimate\nelement to the analysis that proves dispositive is\nwhether or not the defendant is benefitting from the\nwrongdoing. My opponent says that there's no benefit\nfrom the wrongdoing unless there is an intent to commit\nthe wrongdoing in the first place, but that's palpably\nnot so because you -- because you have the benefit if\nyou have the benefit. And to the extent that there\nis -- an intent requirement might be perceived as\nnecessary to provide some level of moral blameworthiness\nin terms of exploiting the wrongdoing, that exploitation\noccurs in any event when the defendant seeks to take\nadvantage of the wrongdoing by making the objection and,\nas in this case, exploiting it even further at trial.\nSo the equities of the situation -- there's\nno, I think, personal equity that weighs in the balance\non the basis of -- in -- on the side of keeping --\nkeeping the evidence out. Where there is the wrongdoing\nand the causation and the profit from the wrongdoing,\nthe statement should come out -- should be admitted\nwithout regard to the mental state of the defendant.\nAnd on that I'll submit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Burkhardt, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BURKHARDT: It State said that there is\nno equity on the side -- on Petitioner's side, and\nthat's simply not true. The statement is a testimony\nstatement; under Crawford, it clearly must be excluded;\nand for the reason that it is -- you know, he has been\ndeprived of his right to test the accuracy of that\nstatement and to expose its falsity.\nHe claims the statement isn't true; and\nunder Crawford, the -- the Framers have prescribed a\ncategorical procedural rule for testing whether a\nstatement is reliable, and that's the right to\nconfrontation; and he was deprived of that right and\nthis in turn derived him of fair -- of a fair trial.\nNow, the Framers in adopting the\nConfrontation Clause understood its parameters to\ninclude certain narrow exceptions. And the exception --\none of the exceptions was a witness tampering exception;\nand that had a very rational basis, because what it\nmeant, in essence, is if the defendant is going to act\nagainst the criminal trial system from which he demands\nand requires justice, he cannot at the same time\nintentionally, deliberately manipulate and thwart the\ncriminal justice system by preventing the appearance of\n-- of necessary witnesses. So in that case, when he\ndoes something of -- to that effect, then it's fair,\nit's equitable and reasonable; he cannot profit from his\nown wrong.\nAnd that maxim that a person cannot profit\nfrom his own wrong was meant to apply to that situation.\nIt wasn't meant to apply in the broad, generalized,\namorphous sense that the State suggests, because that\nwould effectively substitute in some sort of amorphous\nnotions for reliability of -- I'm sorry, fairness -- for\nthe amorphous notions of reliability standard that this\nCourt just rejected by overruling Roberts.\nIn fact, what's happened here is the State\nis attempting to resuscitate Roberts and to eviscerate\nCrawford; and it is no accident that this whole issue\narose after Crawford. This is a post-Crawford\ninvention. It did not even exist before. And it's not\n-- the ink on Crawford was barely dry before the Supreme\nCourt of Kansas, like six weeks later, enacted this --\nthis first forfeiture-by-causation rule; and then a\nnumber of States such as California followed, and they\nall cite each other as authority.\nBut nothing before, because nothing before\nexisted. And when this Court in Crawford said we accept\nthe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing, we submit that the\nCourt couldn't possibly have meant this broad standard\nthat California created, because it did not exist at\nthat time.\nWe suggest that what this Court meant, as it\nindicated in Davis, is the -- essentially the Federal\nrule entitled forfeiture by wrongdoing, which is\nspecifically directed to witness tampering. And that\nsaid -- and codifies, as this Court said in Davis, the\ndoctrine of forfeiture that has existed at the common\nlaw; that was -- that has been understood for hundreds\nof years, that was carried forward and preserved in\nReynolds, and then it was further carried forward to the\nFederal rule.\nThat's all we want. We want the rule as it\nhas always existed, not some new expanded rule that\nthe -- California has just created to undermine and\neviscerate my client's rights to confrontation. We are\njust asking for a fair trial, which he did not get. And\nthe notion that he is profiting. Well, in that sense,\neveryone profits from the Confrontation Clause. It was\ndesigned to protect defendants from encroachment on the\nState. It was designed to provide defendants a fair\ntrial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right, it would\ngo back on the harmless error question, right?\nMS. BURKHARDT: Yes. It could go back to a\nharmless error question or perhaps a new trial.\nThey can retrial -- retry him. They have\nplenty of evidence on which to retry him in this case.\nThis is why -- that's all we are asking for, a fair\ntrial, not a trial under a brand-new standard which they\nconcocted for the purpose of eviscerating Crawford,\nwhich is exactly what happened.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
