        "content": "(10:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 12-399, Adoptive\nCouple v. Baby Girl.\nMs. Blatt?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAll parties agree that even if the birth\nfather is a parent under the Indian Child Welfare Act,\nthe State court decision below awarding custody to the\nfather must nonetheless be reversed unless Sections\n1912(d) or (f) create custodial rights that the father\nconcededly does not have under State law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting -- I\ndon't know that the parties -- I know that the\nGovernment has said that (f) doesn't apply to the\nfather, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession\non your point. But putting that aside, if it is a\nfather who has visitation rights, and exercising all of\nhis support obligations, is it your position that -\nthat because that father's not a custodian, he has no\nprotections whatsoever under (d) or (e)?\nThe State can come and take the child away\nfrom an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with\ncustody, and that responsible parent who only has\nvisiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or\n(f)?\nMS. BLATT: Well, under State law -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not asking about\nState law -\nMS. BLATT: Right. I think that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I'm asking about\nFederal law.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, it's Federal law, which\nrequires custodial rights, would protect a father who\nhas visitation, i.e., custodial rights under State law.\nSo in other words, that -- that is to say,\nif a father -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, (d) doesn't talk\nabout custodial rights. I do agree that (f) talks about\ncontinued -\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- custody.\nMS. BLATT: Okay. So let's talk about (d),\nbecause I think we are in agreement that the Respondents\nwould have to agree that they either need to win under\n(d) or (f), and we can talk about Section 1915, but\nthat's not a basis for father.\nBut section (d) -- and I'm reading from the\nblue brief at 8a -- says that it requires the party\nseeking the termination of parental rights to provide,\nquote, \"remedial services and rehabilitative programs\ndesigned to prevent the breakup of the Indian family.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you don't think\nthat a parent with custody -- well, you do think a\nparent with custody is the only definition of family,\nbut why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation\nrights be considered a family with that child?\nMS. BLATT: My understanding under State\nlaw, a parent who -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to State\nlaw -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could I\nhear her answer, please?\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nSo the answer is, a parent with visitation\nrights has custody, so he's protected.\nUnder State law, if you're paying child\nsupport and you bring a paternity action and sue for\nvisitation rights, that's a petition for custody. So\nall a birth dad needs to do to protect himself is to\nacquire legal rights.\nThis father had no legal rights whatsoever,\nparental or custodial, and the word \"breakup,\" even the\nother side concedes, it's discontinuance of an existing\nlegal relationship. There was no legal relationship\nbetween this child and the birth father or his\nrelatives.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there is a support\nobligation on that unwed father.\nMS. BLATT: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that a\nparental right? It's one of the parental rights the\nStates enforce whether or not you want to provide\nsupport or not.\nMS. BLATT: If a child is being adopted, by\ndefinition, the -- the adoptive family would be\nproviding support. But let's take the -- let's take\nwhat a -- again, the definition of breakup. There is no\nfamilial legal custodial parental relationship that\neither this father or the -- or his parents -- his\nextended family had with this child.\nThis adoption no more broke up an Indian\nfamily than his -- than this Hispanic sole custodial\nbirth mother had raised the child herself.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with\nthe States that do give unwed fathers that don't support\ntheir children and who don't have an ongoing\nrelationship the right to be considered first for\nadoption? Why should we follow the definitions of South\nCarolina or those other States? Why shouldn't we just\ngive it a Federal meaning?\nMS. BLATT: Because there's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As -\nMS. BLATT: Because there's nothing in this\nAct that anyone can point to that was a basis for\ntransferring custody to this father. At most, there is\nan obligation, an exhaustion obligation, that if a\ncustodial parent has something like a drug abuse problem\nthe State has to remediate before the family is broken\nup.\nWhat is so extraordinary about this case,\nparticularly the United States' position, is that the\nadoptive parents' failure to remediate a dad meant that\nthe child got custody of the dad. So if this dad had\nhad a drug problem, because there was no treatment of\nhim the court held, well, that's a basis for giving the\ndad custody.\nBut there's no language in the statute that\neven remotely suggests that it's a rights-creating\nprovision. All of both of (d), (e), and (f) are\nprotections that assume existing rights and then make it\nharder to terminate those rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your argument\nassumes that the phrase in the statute \"to prevent the\nbreakup of the Indian family\" only applies where -\nwhere the father has custody. I don't -- I don't know\nwhy that should be true. If -- if that's what Congress\nmeant, they could have put it much more narrowly. They\nhad a very broad phrase, \"to prevent the break up of an\nIndian family.\" And this guy is -- is the father of the\nchild -\nMS. BLATT: So he -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and they're taking the\nchild away from him even though he wants it.\nMS. BLATT: Okay. But when you -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that is not the\nbreakup of -- of an Indian family?\nMS. BLATT: The only relationship the dad\nhad is one of biology. And, Justice Scalia, you cannot\nlogically break up that biological relationship, nor can\nyou provide remedial services to prevent the breakup of\nthat biological relationship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. You're\nreading -- you're reading \"Indian family\" to mean\nsomething more than -- than a biological relationship,\nright? You're going to hang a lot of -- a lot of other\nornaments on that phrase?\nMS. BLATT: Well, I'm hanging -- I'm hanging\na lot on two things.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems to me he's\nthe father, the other woman's the mother, that's the -\nthat's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and\nthe kid.\nMS. BLATT: He has a biological link that\nunder State law was equivalent to a sperm donor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's the father. He's the\nfather.\nMS. BLATT: And so is a sperm donor under\nyour definition. He's a biological father and nothing\nelse in the eyes of State law. And under that view -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't State law. This\nis a Federal statute which uses an expansive phrase,\n\"the breakup of the Indian family.\"\nMS. BLATT: Right. And there is no Indian\nfamily here. The only breakup -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference\nwith a sperm donor? I mean, I know that you raise that\nin your brief. But, going back to Justice Scalia's\npoint, if the choice is between a mother, a biological\nfather, or a stranger, and if the father's fit, why do\nyou think that the Federal statute requires that it be\ngiven to a stranger rather than to the biological father\nwhen the statute defines \"parent\" as the biological\nfather?\nMS. BLATT: And assuming all biological\nfathers that are acknowledged or established are swept\nin, which would include any biological father, the only\nstranger in this case was the birth father, who\nexpressly repudiated all parental rights and had no\ncustodial rights. So, again, the problem the other side\nhas -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't. I mean,\nhe -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights\nto the mother, but not to a stranger. And when the\nissue of adoption came up, he said: \"Yes, I want to\nassert my parental rights.\"\nMS. BLATT: It was too late. There's not a\nsingle State law that lets a dad, birth dad, hold that\nkind of veto power over a woman.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it -- where is\nthere a reference in the definition of \"parent\" to a\nState law? I see the -- which is the section which\ndefines a parent?\nMS. BLATT: Section 1903(9). But even\nassuming -- which is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: -- on page 4A. Whether it's a\nFederal definition or a State law definition, I think\neveryone agrees you've got to at least look at some sort\nof State law. But even if it's just a bare fact of\npaternity, meaning a biological link is established,\nthey still have to have a basis for an extraordinary\naward of a transfer of custody when there's been no best\ninterest determination and you have a dad who's a\ncomplete stranger with no -- no parental rights\nwhatsoever.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It says a parent means a\nbiological parent of an Indian child, and he fits that\ndefinition. And then the next section -- the next\nsentence doesn't have any reference to State law.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. And again,\nassuming he is a parent -- they -- they need to win both\npoints, Justice Ginsburg. He needs to be a parent.\nNow, if you're an ICWA parent, which means\nif you want to accept this definition of \"all\nbiological,\" you do have rights under the Federal Act of\ngetting notice and a right to counsel, and the tribe\nwould have a right to intervene. The question is, is\nthere a basis for transferring custody under (d) or (f).\n(F) is the one that requires continuing custody.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a\nparent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him\nsome rights? In other words, what's the point of making\nhim a parent under that definitional section if he\ndoesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides\nfor when to terminate rights?\nMS. BLATT: Because this -- this Act is not\nabout creating rights that didn't otherwise exist. It's\nabout protecting rights and making it harder to\nterminate rights that already exist.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what's the point of\nlabeling him a parent if he gets no parental rights\nunder the statute and if the termination provisions\ndon't apply to him?\nMS. BLATT: Notice, right to counsel, and\nheightened consent requirements. So the mother here,\nthe birth mother is a parent, so she had a right to\nnotice, right to counsel, and heightened consent\nrequirements.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what are they supposed\nto -\nMS. BLATT: So those are very significant.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how are they\nsignificant? I mean, I'm trying to understand this,\nbecause if you get notice, but then you have nothing to\nsay in the proceeding because the statute gives you no\nrights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for\nterminating those rights -\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- what are you supposed to\ndo once you get notice?\nMS. BLATT: Justice Kagan, just because he's\nin the door as a parent, that doesn't mean the statute\nlet him leave out the back door with the child when\nthere was no, no determination with respect to -- I\nmean, any kind -- it would be unprecedented to think\nthat because you had a failure to remediate to prevent\nthe breakup of an Indian family, that's a basis for\nawarding custody? And that's the United States' view,\nwhich is -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think you're not answering\nthe question of what's the point of labeling him a\nparent if he gets none of the protections that the Act\nprovides to a parent?\nMS. BLATT: You're assuming that this entire\nAct was to make sure unwed dads who are Indian got more\ntime than non-Indian dads to veto adoptions, and that\nhad -- that's not even remotely the purpose of this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait, wait, wait.\nIsn't your answer 1915(a) still applies?\nMS. BLATT: 1915(a) still applies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so 1915(a) means -\nthat's right.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he does have a -- a\nconsiderable right.\nMS. BLATT: Well, 19 -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, they'll have to go\nthrough a set and decide. They have to give it to him\nunless -- unless something overcomes the preference or\nthere is good cause to the contrary.\nMS. BLATT: He's not -- he didn't seek to\nadopt the child and he's not one of the preferred\nparties.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're thinking about\nthis case. I'm thinking in general. I think the\nquestion -\nMS. BLATT: Well, no -- no father is a\npreferred party under 1915. No father can -- can assert\n1915. That is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't 1915 preclude the\nadoptive parents because they're not in the preferred\ncategory? If 1915(a) precludes the adoption, then the\nadoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting\nto an award to the father.\nMS. BLATT: Right. Well, we have three\nresponses. First, that provision assumes that somebody\nactually in that -- in that statute stepped up to adopt\nthe child, and no one did here.\nSecond, it would raise grave constitutional\nconcerns. I mean, just look at (a)(3) on the other\nIndian families if Congress presumptively presumed that\na non-Indian parent was unfit to raise any child with\nany amount of Indian blood. And so it would either have\nto -- it's not implicated here or resolved by good\ncause. Otherwise, you do have an extraordinary reading,\nJustice Ginsburg, of a statute that would override a\nbirth mother's right to choose the adoptive parents for\nher child.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it your position\nthat the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor\nto be considered with the other -- in other words, if\nevery other factor suggests that the best interests of\nthe child are served by placement with the adoptive\ncouple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all\nthose other interests?\nMS. BLATT: It's not our view. Our view is\nyou would have -- you absolutely would have had good\ncause with -- here when you had the 27 months and also\nthe mother's choice. The tribe 's position is that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not listed under\nthe -- there are guidelines for what constitutes good\ncause.\nMS. BLATT: The best interests of the child\nis not listed under the Government's guidelines, which\nagain is extraordinary. It's also extraordinary that\nany other adopt -- any other Indian would get a\npreference whether or not that Indian had the same\ntribal member.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in your view, at\nwhat point, at what date did the Indian father lose the\nright to ask for custody? Because he changed his mind\nin -- in January, there was about a 5-day period there.\nMS. BLATT: Yeah.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The adoption proceedings\nhad not concluded.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And at this point he said,\nin effect: I've changed my mind.\nMS. BLATT: So State law is you have to\nsupport the mother during pregnancy or at birth. So the\ncases are pretty clear that the father can't wait till\nhe learns of the adoption.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the State law\ndetermines when his rights under the Federal Act end?\nMS. BLATT: No. State law determines just\nwhen you have parental rights to begin with. So if\nthere's no question that this particular dad, had State\nlaw applied, the adoption would have gone forward and\nhis rights would have been terminated by virtue of his\nlack of a right to -- to object to the adoption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless we believe that the\nFederal statute determines when he has parental rights\nby defining \"parent\" to include a biological father.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, but you still have -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's the case, then\nwhat you said doesn't apply.\nMS. BLATT: -- custodial rights, though.\nThat's not a basis for granting him custodial rights.\nThis -- again, the -- we can talk about (f), but I think\n(f) is pretty obvious that that assumes\npreexisting custody to be continued.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I wanted you to talk\nabout (f). Are you going to say something about that\nor -\nMS. BLATT: Yes, and I do -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to leave it\nto the Government?\nMS. BLATT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree with the\nGovernment's position, do you?\nMS. BLATT: Well, the Government agrees with\nus on (f). But if you read (d), by the way, it is\ninextricably intertwined with (e) and (f). It's talking\nabout the breakup of a removal proceeding under (f) or a\nfoster care proceeding under (e), and the Government\nconcedes that neither of those provisions create rights;\nthey just make it harder to terminate the custodial\nrights of a parent who has custody that can be\ncontinued.\nThe other side doesn't really have a\ndefinition of \"custody\" or \"continue\" that would sweep\nin a dad without any parental rights. And I do just\nwant to say in terms of looking, taking one step back.\nThis is not the case that Congress had in mind when it\npassed the Act to halt the depletion of the tribal\npopulation. This involves accretion and conscripting\nother people's children to grow the tribal population\nbased solely on a biological link.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, continuing on the\nassumption that this man is a parent under the statutory\ndefinition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is\nthat there are really two classes of parents under the\nstatute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but\nthen there are the parents who get the protections of -\nof the termination of rights provision and the parents\nwho don't.\nAnd I'm just wondering why if this statute\ncreates two classes of parents it didn't say that in a\nmore upfront kind of way.\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It seems a strange thing to\nread into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that\nthere are really two kinds of parents.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think it's rather\ncompletely upside down that this entire statute, with 20\nor 24 references to removal, custody, return of child to\nthe parent, is somehow being read to create rights.\nThere is no language in this statute that creates\ncustodial rights, and the birth father in this case,\nbecause of an exhaustion failure under (d), walked off\nwith the child without any best interest determination.\nIf I could -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Clement?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT GUARDIAN\nAD LITEM IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBut for the application of ICWA, two things\nwould be crystal clear: The birth father would have\nabsolutely no parental or custodial rights under State\nlaw or the Constitution; and second, the baby girl would\nbe entitled to a custodial determination that focused on\nher best interests.\nNow, the lower courts -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you do with the\nlower court's determination that one of the factors of\nthe best interest calculus was the Federal policy to\nensure that Indian children, children of biological\nIndian parents, at least one, should be raised with\ntheir parents? Because the lower court said it thought\nit was in the best interest of this child to stay with\nits birth father in light of the Federal policy. So I\ndisagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best\ninterest -\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, would that\nit were true that the Federal preference was one factor\nin a multifactor test that looked at this child in her\nbest interest. That did not happen here. And if you\nhave any doubt about that, look at page 40a of the\npetition appendix. And what the lower court -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do I do with the\nlower court's finding that this father, despite not\nbeing married to his prior lover, had children, was\nattentive of those children, had the resources to raise\nthe child? What do we with -- why are you -\nMR. CLEMENT: What you do with that, Justice\nSotomayor, is you look what context those findings were\nmade. Those findings were made in the context of\n1912(f), and the court specifically said that for those\npurposes all I can look at is the birth father and\nwhether this new custodial relationship beyond a\nreasonable doubt would pose a serious harm to the girl.\nAnd what he -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they looked at\nsomething else that everybody's ignoring -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Please finish. Let's\nfinish.\nMR. CLEMENT: What the court specifically\nsaid is they looked at the expert testimony of how it\nwould cause trauma, despair, anxiety, depression on this\nbaby girl to be taken from her parents, and the court\nspecifically said all of that was legally irrelevant\nbecause 1912(f) only lets you look at the harm from the\nnew custodial relationship; it doesn't let you look at\nany harm from the breakup of the previous custodial\nrelationship.\nAnd all of that would make sense if you were\ntalking about 912(f)'s application to the situations\nit's designed for.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and even in that\nsense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much\ndifferent threshold than the best interests of the\nchild, even on the statutory terms.\nMR. CLEMENT: It's miles away. And it's the\nappropriate standard when you're taking somebody who has\nexisting legal custody and depriving them of it. But\neverywhere in the law, including ICWA, when you make an\ninitial placement of a child in a new custodial setting,\nyou don't do that unless you look at the child's best\ninterest.\nAnd look 1916(a) of ICWA, which is the only\nprovision in the Act that specifically contemplates a\nchild being placed in a new custodial setting. It talks\nabout what happens if you have an adoption and then the\nadoptive parents for some reason terminate their rights\nand then you send the child back to their original\nIndian custodian. And in that situation, recognizing\nthat when there's been a break of custody, you don't\njust send somebody off to a -- a new setting based on\nbeyond a reasonable doubt; you look at the best\ninterests of the child. And that's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, can I go\nback to that best interest calculus. There's two\ntimeframes in my mind to look at: In January, when he\nasserted his parental rights and 2 years later when the\ntrial was heard. If there's serious emotional harm, I\nthink the court below said: We're not looking at what\nhappens at the time we're deciding the custody issue,\nbecause otherwise, we're going to give custody by\nestoppel.\nWe're going to encourage people to hold on\nto kids and create the serious physical harm. In\nJanuary, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're\nlooking at. What was in the best interests of the child\nat the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5\nmonths after the birth of the child.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm\nhere representing the guardian who represents the best\ninterest of the child. From the child's perspective,\nthe child really doesn't care whose fault it was when\nthey were brought in one custodial situation or another.\nThey just want a determination that focuses\non at the relevant time, that time, what's in their best\ninterest. And so in the same way that we think if you\nrule in our favor and you remand to the lower court that\nthere has to be a best interest determination that takes\ninto account the current situation, notwithstanding that\nthat would be on the hypothesis that the last 15 months\nof custody were based on a legal misunderstanding, we\nstill think this girl -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we're going to freeze\nit at that point or are we going to freeze it today,\nafter the child's been with his -- with her father for 2\nyears?\nMR. CLEMENT: You freeze it at the time that\nsomebody's talking about -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't want to be that\njudge, by the way.\nMR. CLEMENT: You freeze it at the time that\nsomebody's talking about changing a custodial situation.\nBut what is so tragic here is that the lower court\napplied 1912(d) and (f), which are clearly designed for\na situation when you're contemplating transferring\ncustody away from an existing custodial relationship.\nThey looked at that and applied those inapposite\nstandards to create a transfer to somebody with new\ncustody.\nNow, the Solicitor -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about now, when you\nsaid the best interest. Now the child has been some\n15 months with the father. So if a best interest\ncalculus is made now, you would have to take into\naccount uprooting that relationship, would you not?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.\nWe're not here to try to say that anybody is entitled to\nautomatic custody of this child based on some legal\nrule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and I take it\nyou'll say that that goes back to this South Carolina\ncourt if you prevail?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. And I would hope\nwith instructions to please make that determination as\nquickly as humanly possible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the best interest of\nthe child is the uniformly accepted standard in State\ncourts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance\nproblems which I -- I think exist here, is there\nanything in the statute that allows us to import the\nbest interests of the child into the statutory language,\nor do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance\nand -- and really rewrite the statute?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of things,\nJustice Kennedy. If you got to the point of applying\n1915(a) and the placement preferences -- and we agree\nwith Petitioners that they're not squarely applicable\nhere, because the birth father's argument was not that I\nget to adopt, but that I have an entitlement -- if you\ngot to that, I think the good cause standard gives you a\nvehicle for importing a lot of best interest standards.\nI also think you could look -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even\nthough the guidelines to what's good cause do not\ninclude best interest.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, but even the\nJustice Department doesn't say that the guidelines are\nbinding or entitled to anything more than Skidmore\ndeference, and I'd take constitutional avoidance over\nSkidmore deference any day.\nBut the second thing I would put on the\ntable is I think the fact that 1916(a) tells you that\nthe one time you are thinking about transferring\ncustody, Congress looked to the best interest standard.\nThat's a good hint that if you are talking about\ntransferring custody you should look to the best\ninterests.\nAnd, again, I think it's imperative to look\nat 1912(d), (e), and (f). As the Government and the\nSolicitor General recognizes, they all contemplate\ncontinued custody, (e) and (f) do.\nNow, then the Government turns around and\nsays: Well, but (d) was a basis for what the lower\ncourt did, which is to transfer custody. With all due\nrespect to the Government, (d) makes even less sense as\na basis for transferring custody than (f). At least (f)\nhas some standard designed for some transfer of custody.\nIt happens to be the wrong transfer. It's the transfer\naway from continuing custody out and it's beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nBut (d) has no standard to satisfy. And\ntheir position is that because this birth father was not\npresented with remedial and rehabilitative services,\ntherefore, because he didn't get remedial services that\npresumably he needed, he gets the child. That's crazy.\nAnd what it shows is that 12(d) assumes that\nit's like an exhaustion requirement, and unless and\nuntil these services are provided you preserve the\nstatus quo ante. But the lower court didn't preserve\nthe status quo ante. The lower court ordered this poor\ngirl sent to somebody who, at least under state law and\njust a matter of practicality, is a stranger to her.\nAnd nowhere in the law do you see any child\nbeing transferred to a new custodial arrangement without\na best interest determination. And why did it happen\nhere? It happened here because of ICWA, which by its\nterms does not apply to these situations, and it\nhappened because of 3/256ths of Cherokee blood.\nNow, the Justice Department back in 1978\nrecognized there were profound constitutional problems\nwith the statute. Then-Assistant Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, later Judge, Patricia Wald, told Congress that\nthere were applications of the statute that raised equal\nprotection problems because they treated people\ndifferently solely on the basis of race.\nOne of the things she pointed to is what she\npoint -- described as \"the (b) portion of the definition\nof 'Indian child.'\" And that's what makes this child an\nIndian child here, its biology, its biology combined\nwith the fact that the tribe, based on a racial\nclassification, thinks that somebody with 325 -\n1 percent Indian blood is enough to make them a\ntribal -- a tribal member, eligible for tribal\nmembership.\nAnd as a result of that, her whole world\nchanges and this whole inquiry changes. It goes from an\ninquiry focused on her best interests and it changes to\na focus on the birth father and whether or not beyond a\nreasonable doubt there is a clear and present danger.\nAgain, that is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what do we do about\nthat?\nMR. CLEMENT: You correct the lower court.\nAnd there's two paths to correct the lower court. One\nway to correct the lower court is to say, look -- can I\nfinish the answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish the answer.\nMR. CLEMENT: You could -- you would either\ndo it by changing the definition of \"parent\" and\nrecognize that, given the consequences that flow from a\nparent in the statute, it only makes sense to prove\nsomething more than bare paternity.\nOr you could do it by recognizing that if\nsomebody gets in the front door of this statute based on\nbare paternity, you have to interpret provisions like\n(d), (e), and (f) with sensitivity to the fact that\nunder that reading just because you are a parent doesn't\nmean you have these kind of extraordinary rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rothfeld?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS BIRTH FATHER, ET AL.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIt is simply false to say that this child's\ncustody was transferred without a best interest\ndetermination, as is apparent from any reading of the\nlower court decisions in this case.\nBoth of the State courts here looked very\nclosely at the situation here and they found, in their\nwords, that the father here was a \"fit, devoted, and\nloving father,\" and they said expressly and found\nexpressly as a factual matter that it was in the best\ninterest of this child.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that's\ncorrect under the Act? Where in the Act does it say\nthat you need to consider whether or not the father is\na -- would be a good parent? I thought your reading was\nthat it doesn't matter, all that matters is that he has\nin his case 3/128ths Cherokee blood.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that there\nis some confusion as to exactly what the State courts\ndid here and what ICWA does. ICWA does not assign\ncustody. ICWA -- ICWA addresses the question whether or\nnot the parental rights of -- of a parent of an Indian\nchild can be terminated. The courts here, both courts,\ncorrectly held that under the plain application of ICWA,\nunder Section 1912(d), as discussed by Justices\nSotomayor and Scalia, clearly parental rights could not\nbe terminated.\nThe question then arose: What happens to\nthe child? And the court then, because there were a\nnatural parent with intact parental rights, applied the\nusual rule that there is a strong presumption that a fit\nparent, natural parent, who wants to exercise custody\nof -- of his or her child should get custody. That was\nwhat happened here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you -- you want us\nto write the case as if this is just a standard best\ninterest determination and -- and this federal statute\nis irrelevant? I don't understand your argument.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, no, Your Honor. I -- I\nthink that the analysis of the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt was exactly right in this -- in -- in those terms.\nThe court applied ICWA, the Federal statute. The\nquestion was: Could the parental rights of this parent\nbe terminated? This -- everyone concedes this is an\nIndian child. ICWA applies because of that.\nThe question then is: Can the parental\nrights be terminated? Sections 1912(e) and (f) address\nthat question -- (d), (e), and (f). And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you apply a \"best\ninterest of the child\" standard to a termination of\nparental rights?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, not in the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, can -- can -- I\nknow a lot of kids that would be better off with\ndifferent parents.\nMR. ROTHFELD: And that -- that, too, is\nexactly right, Justice Scalia. That is precisely what\nthe ordinary state law standard says, that there is a\npresumption that the natural parent, if the natural\nparent is fit, should be awarded custody of the child.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually, it does -- does\n(f) apply in your opinion to this case or not?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes, it -- in our opinion,\nboth (d) and (f) apply.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And (f) has something of\nthe best interest standard tilted towards the Indian\nparent.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not? I\nmean, as I read it it's something. It's tough, but it's\nthere.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that that's right,\nbut I -- but I would add the -- the caveat that it's not\na best interest in the sense of we are going to apply\nthis standard to determine custody.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in your view the best\ninterest standard does not apply, but rather (f)\napplies?\nMR. ROTHFELD: (F) applies -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And (f) is a tough version\nof the best interest standard.\nHave I got it right or not?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Correct, but with this\naddition: What it applies for is the question whether\nor not the rights of this parent can be terminated,\nwhether the parental rights of the parent can be\nterminated. And so -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how does (f) apply?\nIt says \"continued custody.\" That seems to assume that\ncustody exists.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is the other\nside's argument. Our response is that there is a\ndefinitional provision in ICWA that says that a child\ncustody proceeding is one that includes a proceeding\nleading to the termination of parental rights. Parental\nrights are defined to be broadly as the parent-child\nrelationship.\nAnd so we think in context (f) means that\nit's the termination of the parent-child relationship is\nwhat has to be considered.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So your argument is not that\n\"continued\" means something different from the normal\nlanguage; your argument is that \"custody\" means\nsomething different from its normal language.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Our argument is that\n\"custody\" means what Congress said \"child custody\nproceeding\" means, which is termination of the\nparent-child relationship. And so we think that\ncontinuation of a relationship -- the question is under\n(f) would that be harmful for the child? But I should\nquickly say that (f) is only one part of the argument\nhere. As Justices Sotomayor and Scalia began the\ndiscussion with Ms. Blatt, (d) also applies. (D) says\nnothing at all about custody. The question under -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could I go\nback to what you just said about (f)? You think custody\ncovers someone who has never had custody of the child\nbecause it refers to something beyond the accepted\ndefinition?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- again, the\ndefinition of \"child custody proceeding\" in ICWA\nincludes a proceeding leading to the termination of\nparental rights. Parental rights -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But (f) doesn't say\n\"child custody proceeding.\" It says \"continued custody\nof the child.\"\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's true, but I\nthink that has to be interpreted within the context of\nthe definitional provision and what Congress had in mind\nwhen it referred to child custody proceeding.\nBut I think -- you know, (f), as I say, is\nonly a portion of the argument here. And to return to\nwhat Justices -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me why you are\nfighting Justice Breyer? He said: I see -- and your --\nMr. Clement said the same thing -- that \"good cause\"\nunder 1958 is a variant of best interests of the child\nor factors that are considered. I see (f) as doing the\nsame thing, allotting however a burden of proof that may\nor may not be higher than other States.\nI mean, in -- in -- some States may have\nclear and convincing evidence, some States may have\npreponderance. Some States -- I don't know if any have\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. But it's an allocation of\nburden.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. I -- I think that that's\nright, and I certainly don't intend to fight\nJustice Breyer. I -- I think that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You should if I'm not\nright.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I don't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think Justice\nBreyer is quite wrong because a standard that says\nresults in serious emotional or physical damage to the\nchild is far from a best interest standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It sure is. And do you\nknow of any State that -- that applies best interest of\nthe child standard to termination of parental rights as\nopposed to adoption?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely not. And I -- and\nI think I -- I will try to agree with both\nJustice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia\nand say that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not me, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROTHFELD: And Justice Sotomayor. And\nalways -- always the Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You might just have to\ntake -\nMR. ROTHFELD: Which gets me to five, so.\nBut I think -- I think the crucial point is\nwhat -- what we're talking about the determination of\nparental rights under -- under (f) is whether or not, as\nJustice Scalia says, the rights of a biological parent\ncan be terminated, which is not sort of the ordinary\nbest interest determination when you're choosing between\ntwo people who are strangers to the child. So -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not -- (f)\nis not about terminating parental rights. It's about\nwhat -- I mean, it's about custody, right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, no. I think (f) is\nabout -- both (d) and (f) are about terminating parental\nrights. Parental rights cannot be terminated unless\nthese determinations have been made. Unless it's been\nshown that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In what proceeding,\nthe adoption proceeding or custody determination?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Any proceeding which is aimed\nat the termination of parental rights. The adoption\nproceeding here cannot go forward, all concede, unless\nparental rights are terminated. And so if parental\nrights cannot be terminated under either (d) or (f),\nthis adoption cannot go forward and we are in a\ndifferent place.\nI think that's what -- exactly what the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court said. It said, we're going\nto apply -- we're going to look to ICWA to see can we\nterminate the parental rights of this natural father.\nAnd as Justice Scalia says, that is central. There is a\nnatural parent here who wants custody. Can his -- can\nhis claim for custody be denied and can his parental\nrights be terminated? To determine that, Congress has\nput Federal standards in place in ICWA, in (d) and (f),\nand we have to say both of those have been satisfied\nhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if you had a\ntribe, is there at all a threshold before you can call,\nunder the statute, a child an \"Indian child\"? 3/256ths?\nAnd what if the tribe -- what if you had a tribe with a\nzero percent blood requirement; they're open for, you\nknow, people who want to apply, who think culturally\nthey're a Cherokee or -- or any number of fundamentally\naccepted conversions.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, is it -\nis -- would that child be considered an Indian child, so\na father who had renounced any interest in her until he\nfound out about the adoption would have all these\nrights?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that would be a\ndifferent question. What we have here is a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. That's why\nI asked it. It's a different question.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well -- and the answer would,\nI think, be as a threshold matter, as this Court has\nsaid consistently, it is fundamental -- fundamental\nbasis of tribal sovereignty that -- that a tribe get to\ndetermine the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the definition\nof an Indian child is just straight out of the statute.\nAn Indian child is someone who is either a member of a\ntribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a\nmember of an Indian tribe.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So return to what is\na hypothetical question and not what the statute\nprovides: Under your argument, a tribe that did not\nrequire any blood requirement, but simply enrollment,\ncould be considered an Indian child.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the -- the child would\nhave to be a -- would have to be biological parents -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you have\nsomebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my\nhypothetical tribe, has a biological child. That child\nwould be an Indian child and the father would be\nentitled to the protections you're arguing for.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's true\nin theory. But of course, A, that is not our case. B,\nif that were to occur and whether or not that would be\nsort of a legitimate basis for determining membership of\na -- in an Indian tribe I think would be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that is a problem.\nBecause, look, I mean, as it appears in this case is he\nhad three Cherokee ancestors at the time of George\nWashington's father. All right? Now, you say, oh,\nwell, that's a different issue.\nBut I don't see how to decide that case\nwithout thinking about this issue, because if your view\nis taken and you accept that definition, a woman who is\na rape victim who has never seen the father could,\nwould, in fact, be at risk under this statute that the\nchild would be taken and given to the father who has\nnever seen it and probably just got out of prison, all\nright? And you don't know that this beyond reasonable\ndoubt standard would satisfy that.\nNow, that's obviously something I find\ndisturbing, as a person and also as a judge, because\nwe're trying to interpret the statute to avoid results\nthat would be very far out, at least. And -- and that's\nwhat I want you to tell me. How do I prevent that kind\nof risk through an interpretation of the statute?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me answer both that\nquestion and the Chief Justice's question which I think\nhave similar responses. As to the rape victim, I am\nconfident that an application of Section 1912(f) would\nlead to termination of that father's parental rights,\nand so he would never be in the picture as a possible -\nwell, the question whether or not custody of someone who\nhas engaged in such conduct could lead to serious\nphysical or emotional damage to the child, I think there\nwill be no difficulty in reaching that conclusion.\nBut on the question of could a tribe\nestablish some manipulative type of -- of membership\ncriteria, it's significant that that is not this case\nbecause -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there Federal\ndefinitions of approvals of tribes? Not every group of\nnative Americans who get together can call themselves a\ntribe.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is quite right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't one of the\nconditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not\nof voluntary membership?\nMR. ROTHFELD: As I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm quite sure that's\nright. So I think the hypothetical is -- is a null set.\nI don't think it ever exists.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -\nMR. ROTHFELD: -- that's what I was trying\nto get to -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just wondering\nis 3/256ths close -- close to zero? I mean, that's -\nthat's the question in terms to me, that if you have a\ndefinition, is it one drop of blood that triggers all\nthese extraordinary rights?\nMR. ROTHFELD: But it has always been the\nCherokee membership criterion that if someone who can\ntrace their lineal ancestry to some -- to a person who\nis on the Dawes Rolls is a member. No one has ever\nquestioned that that is a legitimate basis for\nestablishing tribal citizenship. And so -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if a tribe makes\neligibility available for anybody who, as a result of a\nDNA test, can establish any Indian ancestry, no matter\nhow slight?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that that would lead\nto the question posed by Justice Scalia. Whether or not\nthat would be a legitimate basis for establishing -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, it's different from his.\nHe says it's -- it has to be based on blood. This would\nbe based on blood.\nMR. ROTHFELD: But I -- I think it leads to\nhis question that there is a Federal element to\nrecognition of an Indian tribe. And I think whether or\nnot tribal membership criteria so far depart from the\ntraditional understanding of what constitutes a tribe as\nto be acceptable for those purposes, that would be a\nquestion to be resolved by the United States, by the\npolitical branches.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are two\nforms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family\ndoctrine. One applies directly to this case; what's the\nstatus of an unwed father, and they seem, under that\ndoctrine, to apply the definition that a parent who\nhasn't been involved in the care during pregnancy is not\na father.\nBut the other side of the doctrine is the\none that addresses, I think, the Chief's concern, which\nis you don't only have Indian blood, but you've been a\nfather who's actually been a member of an Indian tribe,\nan active member.\nWe don't have to reach that separate issue\nhere, that EIFD -- that part of the EIFD doctrine.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I guess I'll give you\ntwo answers to that. First, in this case, there has\nbeen a finding by the family court that this father has\nsignificant ties to the Cherokee Nation. And so, if one\ncould think that that was part of the test under ICWA,\nit is certainly satisfied here.\nI -- I would go further than that and say\nthat I think the vast majority of State courts have\ncorrectly rejected that theory, because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree.\nMR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would be sort of\nbeyond the judicial competence to determine whether or\nnot a particular person is Indian enough to qualify for\ntreatment as a father of an Indian child under -- under\nICWA.\nJust to nail this down, as to the particular\nmembership criteria of the Cherokee Nation, no one has\never suggested, our opponents here do not suggest that\nthat is, in any sense, illegitimate or not a traditional\nbasis for establishing membership in an Indian tribe.\nSo if one can imagine wild hypotheticals of\nthe sort that Justice Alito and the Chief Justice have\nsuggested, they are not present here, and those would\npresent political questions to be addressed by Congress\nor addressed by the executive branch.\nIn this case, again, the Sate courts found\nthat ICWA should be applied to allow a natural father to\nraise his child. Those courts found that s in the best\ninterests of the child to be raised by their natural\nparent because that parent was a fit, was a loving, was\na devoted parent in the words of -- of the lower courts.\nThose conclusions were quite clearly correct.\nAnd if I can turn to something which\nattracted some attention from Justice Scalia and Justice\nSotomayor in their exchanges with Ms. Blatt, the\napplication of Section 1912(d) and whether or not the\nparental rights of this -- this father, who\nunquestionably satisfies the definition of parent in\nICWA, Section 1912(d) says that parental rights cannot\nbe terminated unless remedial efforts have been made,\nrehabilitative efforts have been made to fix a family\nthat is broken in some respect.\nAnd Ms. Blatt suggests that that does not\napply here because there was no Indian family. I think\nwhat Justice Scalia said was absolutely right. There\nunquestionably was a family here in the ordinary sense.\nThere was a mother, there was a father, there was their\nlittle girl, there were grandparents who very much\nwanted to be involved in the life of this child, who\nknit socks for her. There's no question -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is my recollection correct\nthat -- that he had offered to -- to marry the mother,\nand she rejected that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is quite\ncorrect. I think that the genesis of this case, they -\nthey were an engaged couple and the mother broke the\nengagement. The father wanted, very much wanted to\nmarry the mother, wanted to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there's\nsome ambiguity there, because one reason why he wanted\nto marry was that he would get more pay and allowances.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there are\ndisputed facts as to what was going on, and so I don't\nwant to hinge a lot on this. But I think it is quite\nclear the father -- they were engaged, the father wanted\nto marry the mother.\nThe father's testimony -- and the family\ncourt found, so we're not talking about simply, you\nknow, assertions here. The family court found that the\nfather was excited by the pregnancy, was looking forward\nto the birth of the child, that he wanted to marry the\nmother so that she would qualify for military health\nbenefits. The father at the time -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was excited, but\nthere is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy\nand nothing at the time of the birth, right, to support\nthe child or the mother?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is true. But\nI -- I am -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he was excited by\nit; he just didn't want to take any responsibility.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that was\nafter she had rejected his offer to marry her, no?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes. I mean -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, these -- these\nconsiderations are why domestic relations pose the\nhardest problems for judges. Our domestic relations\njudges all by themselves every day have these difficult\nproblems. If we could appoint King Solomon, who was the\nfirst domestic relations judge, as special master, we\ncould do it. But we can't do it.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that -- that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY. But what we have -- what\nwe have here is a question of a Federal statute which,\nas I must understand it, displaces the ordinary best\ninterest determinations of the State courts. Would you\nagree with that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I would agree that\nCongress indicated that part of the best interest\ninquiry for an Indian child concerns -- takes account of\ntheir status as an Indian child, and Congress made a\nfactual determination -- the fact that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you make\nthat concession. I mean, your client has been deprived\nof parental rights. I do not know that -- that it is\ntraditional to decide whether a parent will be deprived\nof parental rights by assessing what is in the best\ninterest of the child.\nThat seems to me quite -\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is quite -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- extraordinary, not\nnormal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But is -- is that true\nunder South Carolina law?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes, that is. I -- with\nrespect to that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under South Carolina law\nin this adoption proceeding, the -- if it had not been\nfor the statute, the best interest of the child standard\nwould not have applied?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think there are three\nthings that are going on here.\nHad ICWA not applied here at all, then the\nfather would have had no right to object to the\nadoption, so the adoption would have gone forward had it\nnot been for ICWA.\nHowever, as Justice Scalia says correctly,\nwhen a natural parent is involved, and the natural\nparent has rights that have not yet been terminated, as\nthis parent's have not, then ordinarily a best interest\ninquiry -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He would be out under\nSouth Carolina law because he didn't support the child\nduring the pregnancy.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I have to disagree with\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. The family court judge found\nthat his parental rights could not be terminated as a\nmatter of South Carolina law, as well as a matter of\nICWA law. And so we think it is quite clear that this\nfather's right would not be terminated.\nAs Justice Scalia says, in the ordinary\ncourse, while we're not engaged in a free-floating best\ninterest inquiry, one would say whether or not a -- a\nprofound showing of parental neglect or insufficiency\nhas been made to terminate those rights. If it cannot,\nthen that father should get custody.\nIn response to what Justice Kennedy asked\nabout -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Termination of parental\nrights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent,\nwhich is quite -\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely\nright, and no such showing has been made or could be\nmade in this case.\nAnd if I may just finish -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have an extra -\nyou have an extra minute.\nMR. ROTHFELD: The -- both of the State\ncourts in this case carefully looked at the -- at the\nsituation here and found that this father, far from\nbeing an unfit father, was a fit, loving, devoted father\nwho had created a safe, satisfactory and -- and loving\nenvironment for the child.\nUnder ordinary South Carolina standards,\nonce one gets past ICWA, parental rights cannot be\nterminated in a situation of this sort, the parental\nrights, as Justice Scalia says, of a natural parent, who\nhad -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if this case would\nhave come out the same way under purely South Carolina\nlaw, then why are we here?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The -- the only reason that\nICWA comes into play is because South Carolina law did\nnot give this father a right to object to the adoption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you very much, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS BIRTH FATHER, ET AL.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start with the definition of\n\"parent\" under the Act because I think a lot flows from\nthat. The Act provides that a parent -- a parent of an\nIndian child is the -- is the biological parent, except\nwhere the child -- or where the parent -- paternity has\nnot been established or acknowledged.\nHere, the -- the father's paternity was\nacknowledged and established, both courts below found.\nAs a consequence, he has not simply a biological\nrelationship to the child; he has a legal relationship\nto the child, created under Federal law.\nThen -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- did you -\nat your -- when you began, do you use \"paternity\" in the\nbiological sense?\nMR. KNEEDLER: \"Paternity\" itself is in a\nbiological sense, but when -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As -- as you -- as you\ninterpret the statute, \"paternity is the biological\nsense,\" not -- not an -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not an existing\nparental relationship.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, a biological sense. But\nthe establishment of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says that, doesn't it?\nA parent is -- is the -- the biological parent.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what it says.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. But what I'm saying is,\nonce -- in the unwed father situation, once the father\nestablishes or acknowledges paternity, the father has a\nlegal relationship, not just the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, family law is\ntraditionally a State province, but your argument is\nthat Federal law can take a traditional family law term\nlike \"parent\" and perhaps others and give it a meaning\nthat is very different from its traditional meaning or\nits meaning under State law?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things about\nthat.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Strike the \"traditional\nmeaning: But its meaning under State law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things about\nthat. First, there are States -- the Casey amicus brief\nin footnote 7 identifies a number of States which\nrecognize parental rights for a parent who has\nestablished or acknowledged citizenship. So the State\nlaw varies on that.\nAnd this was the -- one of the very problems\nCongress was concerned about with respect to Indian\nchildren, because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I didn't understand.\nCitizenship, who has acknowledged citizenship?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. I meant to say\npaternity. Sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I understand now.\nMR. KNEEDLER: What you have here are people\nwho are citizens of two separate sovereigns. An Indian\ntribe is a sovereign and a State. Congress tried to\naccommodate those competing interests by leaving the\ncases in State court, letting them be subject to State\nlaw, but subject to minimum standards to protect the\npeople who are citizens -- or eligible for citizenship\nin the Indian tribe.\nThat is a classic implementation of\nCongress's plenary responsibility in the Federal trust\nand guardianship for Indians, and nothing could be more\nat the core of tribal self-determination and tribal\nsurvival than the determination of tribal membership and\nthe care about what happens to Indian children.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, let's say\nyou're right that this man is a parent under the terms\nof the Act, so not just a biological father but also he\nhas a legal status as parent under this Act. And then\n1912 says, well, this is how you go about terminating\nparental rights, right?\nBut then your argument suggests that one of\nthese clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't,\neven though he's a parent. But you're saying he only\ngets some of the protections, that there are really two\nclasses of parents, custodial parents and non.\nSo where does that come from?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it's not two classes\nof parents. It comes from the text of (f) itself, which\ntalks about continued custody, which we think means that\n(f) applies -- it presupposes that there is custody to\ncontinue. And that's just a condition on the\ntermination of parental rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a very strange way\nto put it. I mean, just -- just in passing in the\nsentence, that \"the continued custody.\" I mean, you\nwould think if that's what they meant, they would say,\n\"where the child\" is -- \"is within the custody of a\nparent, comma, no termination of parental rights may be\nordered, in the absence of a determination,\" blah, blah,\nblah, blah, blah.\nIt doesn't say that. It says, \"No\ntermination may be ordered in absence of a\ndetermination, including testimony of a qualified\nexpert, that the continued custody of the child by the\nparent or Indian custodian is likely to result in\nserious emotional.\"\nWhen it's -- when it's framed that way, I\nam -- I am inclined to believe that the \"continued\ncustody\" means looks to the future, the continuing\ncustody by this person in the future. To read into it\nthe fact that -- that the whole provision only applies\nto someone who is then in custody of the child, that's\nvery strange. That's -- that's not the way somebody\nwould write a provision like that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I grant you it is\nsomewhat awkwardly written, but we think the sense of it\nis -- is that, because this is -- as this court noted in\nthe Santosky decision, this is a very unusual statutory\nprovision with respect to the burden of proof.\nAnd there is some logic for Congress\napplying this -- this -- where there is a custodial -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But doesn't it happen, in\nyour interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an\ninterpretation I can understand, that -- remember my\nhypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic. We\ncan think of a whole range of things short of that where\nthe father has seen the mother never, perhaps, or sperm\ndonors for very short periods of time, and under your\ninterpretation where there is an ongoing relationship,\neven a short one, at least they can't give the child to\nthe father where it would be very harmful to the -- to\nthe child.\nBut under your interpretation, the one\ncategory of people who is exempt from that are the\ncategory of fathers who've never seen the mother.\nWho've seen the mother a very short time. Who may be in\n-- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's\nvery harmful to the child.\nSo I just -- am I right about your\ninterpretation having that effect? And if it does have\nthat effect, what's the justification for it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- there's\nseveral -- several things about that with respect to the\nrapist and the sperm donor. In the 35-year history of\nthis statute -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you can say,\noh, there's no such thing as a parent, a father who only\nsees the mother -\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, no, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Okay. All\nright.\nNow, let's suppose there is such a thing.\nAs long as there is such a thing, the anomaly that I\nmention seems to me to exist. And am I wrong or right\nabout that? And if it exists, what's the basis for your\ncreating an interpretation of the statute that would\nproduce it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's -- it's not as anomalous\nas you're suggesting because state law standards still\napply, and under state law standard under Santosky,\nthere has to be clear and convincing evidence to\nterminate -- to apply the State termination of parental\nrights provisions, which is what the family court did in\nthis case.\nThis is -- this is a Federal overlay, an\nadditional requirement.\nIf I could, though, move on to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But as a Federal overlay,\nMr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of\nsplit apart (d) and (f) in this way? Because (d) is the\ncuring provision that says you have to take steps to try\nto cure this parent and, you know, to try to make him or\nher a better parent. And then (f) says here's the\nstandard for terminating parental rights if those\ncurative efforts have failed. Right?\nSo to -- to use -- to have the curative\nprovision but not the standard just seems to -- to make\na -- a mess of the statute.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, with respect, I don't\nthink so, because custody is in the one and -- and not\nin the other. (D) speaks of breakup of -- of the family\nrelationship. And I think there, the family\nrelationship, because it -- it speaks of termination of\nparental rights, which is in turn defined in the Act as\nanything that terminates the parent-child relationship,\nwhich -- which can be much broader than -- than whether\nthe parent actually has custody, which is the word\nthat -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the whole thrust of\nit, you -- this is directed to providing remedial\nservices, which it -- it seems that it fits a situation\nwhere someone has custody but is having problems getting\nhis or her act together so needs the help of a social\nworker, but it makes no sense to talk about remedial\nservices for someone who has never had custody.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Not -- with -- with respect,\nJustice Ginsburg, I don't agree. Remedial services here\nwould entail -- the remedial services have to be tied to\nwhatever the problem is. And here the problem was the\nfather had not shown sufficient interest in the child.\nRemedial services would have been efforts to interest\nthe father in the child.\nHere that wasn't necessary because as soon\nas the father found out about the adoption proceeding,\nhe acknowledged and established his paternity and said,\nI want that child.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he didn't want\nanything to do with the child if the mother had kept the\nchild in her care. It was only when she wanted to put\nit up for adoption that he had developed this interest\nin the child.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that's -- that is\nprecisely the point when ICWA kicks in. ICWA does not\ntry to regulate the relationship between the mother and\nthe father. That is -- that is left to State law or\ntribal law. ICWA kicks in only when there's going to be\nan adoption or a termination of rights and the child is\ngoing to be placed outside of -- of the relationship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's -- is -\nis -- are the would-be adoptive parents required to\nprovide remedial services and rehabilitative programs\nunder (d)?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, their burden is to\ndemonstrate that that has happened. The remedial -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that it's a\ntribe -- if the tribe wants to defeat the adoption, all\nthey have to do is do nothing with respect to the\nfather's -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think the -- the\nfamily court could direct that remedial service -\nthis -- this happens, I think, frequently in family\ncourt, is the remedial services -- this is not an\nunusual provision. Much State family law provides for\nthis. The State court can oversee the -- the remedial\nservices and that could have been done in this -- in\nthis case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMs. Blatt, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIf you affirm below, you're basically\nbanning the interracial adoption of abandoned Indian\nchildren. There's not a single adoptive parent in their\nright mind who is going to do what the court below said,\nwhich is go through these Kafkaesque hoops of making\nsure an absentee father's desire to be a parent has been\nstimulated.\nThis is private adoption. This is absurd\nthat an adoptive parent would beg the family court to go\nprovide parenting classes. And I wanted to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this Act, in\nterms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by\nparents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent\nuntil the court does the adoption decree. It gives the\nmother the right -- or father -- to rescind the\nvoluntary adoption till the very last minute. Has that\nstopped voluntary adoptions?\nMS. BLATT: No, but this -- first of all --\nI mean, I love that about this case, the irony here. He\nhad no -- we didn't need his consent under State law, so\nthe application of 1913, which allowed this withdrawal\nof consent, mandates the return of the child.\nWell, there was no way to return this child\nto anybody other than the mother. And I want you to\nkeep in mind about this case, is your decision is going\nto apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York\nCity where a tribal member impregnates someone who's\nAfrican-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that\nview, even though the father is a completely absentee\nfather, you are rendering these women second-class\ncitizens with inferior rights to direct their\nreproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.\nYou are relegating adopted parents to go to\nthe back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt.\nAnd you're basically relegating the child, the child to\na piece of property with a sign that says, \"Indian, keep\noff. Do not disturb.\"\nThis case is going to affect any interracial\nadoption of children.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was its intent.\nMS. BLATT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that that's\nwhat its intent was?\nMS. BLATT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It only applies to children\nof -- to tribal children. And -- and the purpose was to\nestablish much more difficult standards for the adoption\nof -- of a child -\nMS. BLATT: No, no, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, maybe you -- you\ndisagree with that policy, but that's clearly a policy\nbehind the law.\nMS. BLATT: No, I think the policy is\nfantastic. It was talking about Indian families who\nwere being ripped away because of cultural biases and\ninsensitivity. This case didn't involve cultural\nbiases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say that. It -\nits definition of -\nMS. BLATT: There's 30,000 pages of\nlegislative history that's talking about the removal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That might is what\nprovoked the Act that Indian children were being removed\nfrom their families, but the Act is written in much\nbroader terms.\nMS. BLATT: I agree. 1915 is extraordinary,\nif you read it the way the tribe does, which is -- and\nthe Government does.\nAnd a little bit about the membership\ncriteria. The tribe's view is any child born Indian is\nautomatically a member. So even if the parents withdrew\ntheir tribal membership, this child would be covered.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
