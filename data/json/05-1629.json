        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in case 05-1629 Gonzales versus\nDuenas-Alvarez.\nMr. Himelfarb.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the term theft\noffense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and\nNationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting.\nThat holding is incorrect. Indeed, it is so clearly\nincorrect that even respondent does not defend it.\nRespondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his\nviolation of the California vehicle theft statute is not\na theft offense under the INA, not because the\nCalifornia statute covers aiding and abetting and the\ntheft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but\nbecause the California statute covers a certain kind of\naiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable\nconsequences rule, and a theft offense does not.\nThat theory is slightly narrower than the\nNinth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same\nreasons. One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's\nholding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit\nthe number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated\nfelons based on a conviction obtained in any\njurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes\nbetween principals and aiders and abetters and it is\nordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a\nparticular case was not convicted as an aider and\nabettor. Respondent's theory would have the same effect\nwhen a conviction was obtained in any jurisdiction that\nobtains the natural and probable consequences rule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Will you help me out on one\nmechanical point? As you probably know from your brief,\nI don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and\nI'm just not used to it. I had thought -- and I guess\nI'm wrong -- that if the natural and probable\nconsequences theory were used to prove, let's say,\nultimately the offense of assault, in what started out\nas a theft case, that there would have to be a separate\ncharge of assault but that the theory of proof would be\nthe natural and consequences extension of aiding and\nabetting so that there would at least be on the record a\ncharge of assault.\nAnd I take it that's not the case.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I -- I don't think it is.\nI --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Otherwise, you wouldn't\nhave this problem.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it is the case that\nthe aider and abettor has to intend to aid and abet what\nis sometimes called the target crime. It also has to be\nthe case that the principal has to then go on to commit\nsome other crime, a subsequent crime. The issue then\narises whether the aider and abettor who intended to\nassist the target crime is held liable for the\nsubsequent crime.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in any case in my\nexample of -- of theft, and the further offense under\nnatural and probable consequences being assault, the\nonly charge against the defendant who aided and abetted\nwould be a charge of theft; is that correct?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It could be. It could be.\nBut in the course of proving the aider and abettor\nguilty of the subsequent crime on this natural and\nprobable consequences theory, there would have to be\nproof that bore upon the target crime to show what his\nintent was with respect to the target crime and also\nwhether the subsequent crime was a foreseeable\nconsequence of the initial crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand it. How\ncan he be convicted of -- of the consequential crime if\nhe is never charged with the consequential crime? You\ncharge him with the -- with the theft and convict him of\nassault?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Scalia. He\nwould have to be charged with the subsequent crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, well I thought you --\nI thought you answered --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Me too.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I didn't mean to say that.\nI meant to say he didn't have to be charged with the\ninitial crime. In fact, even the principal wouldn't\nhave to be charged with the initial crime or for that\nmatter, any crime. The aider and abettor could be\ncharged only with a consequent crime but in the course\nof proving that under the natural and probable\nconsequences rule, there would have to be proof with\nrespect to the target crime, because the elements of the\nnatural and probable consequences rule depend upon what\nhappened.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The theory being that\nanybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which\nnaturally leads to another crime intended the other\ncrime as well.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's the basic principle.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Himmelfarb, does the\ngovernment urge that we consider the point that you're\nnow arguing and the other points? You started out by\nsaying everyone agrees that the rationale of the Ninth\nCircuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we\nare deciding the question as a matter of first view\ninstead of review.\nDoes the government urge that we dispose of\nthose issues anyway, even though they were not disposed\nof by the Ninth Circuit?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We think that the aiding\nand betting argument that respondent raises is fairly\nincluded within the question presented and that it\nshould be resolved. We don't think the other two issues\nare fairly included within the question presented.\nWe think that this issue is fairly presented\nwithin the -- fairly included within the question\npresented and should resolve --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't discussed\nby the Ninth Circuit, was it?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It wasn't,\nJustice Ginsburg, but it bears upon the question of what\nit means to say that an aggravated felony encompasses\naiding and abetting. If the Court simply holds contrary\nto the Ninth Circuit's holding that aiding and abetting\nis included in an aggravated felony, it will leave open\na very important question which we think the Court\nshould provide guidance to the lower courts on. It\nwould leave open the question of whether that means that\nthere is some general Federal immigration law definition\nof aiding and abetting with which the law of aiding and\nabetting in the jurisdiction of conviction would have to\nbe compared in every single removal case, at least\npotentially, or rather as we would submit, that Congress\nintended to cover the entire range of aiding and\nabetting under whatever formulation was used in any\njurisdiction at the time the aiding and abetting\nprovision was added to the Immigration and Nationality\nAct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what about the\nremaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth\nCircuit?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, certainly the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we remand for those or\nwhat?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Yes. It's open to -- it\nwould be open to the Ninth Circuit. Assuming the Ninth\nCircuit were of the view that they were fairly raised in\nthe Ninth Circuit, and also that they were fairly raised\nin the agency, it would be open to the Ninth Circuit to\nresolve those questions in the first instance. Let me\njust add that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would it have to be\nraised in the Ninth Circuit? I thought this case was\ncontrolled by a prior decision of the Ninth Circuit.\nTherefore, there was nothing more that was needed to\ntake care of this case.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true. The Ninth\nCircuit didn't pass upon any issue except the question\nwhether aiding and abetting as a general matter is\nincluded in a theft offense. Relying on a prior\ndecision, it held that it wasn't, and sent the case back\nto the Board of Immigration Appeals. But there, I think\nit would still be fair for the government to argue that\na particular theory that may be raised here in defense\nof the judgment wasn't properly raised either in the\nNinth Circuit by respondent, or before the agency, such\nthat that claim was not properly exhausted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Himelfarb, you point\nout these last two issues are not, and probably\ncorrectly, that they are not fairly included within the\nquestion presented. Well, that would be disabling if\nindeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise\nthose two additional issues. But here it is the\nrespondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if\nwe want to.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Of course. Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The respondent can seek to\nuphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we can reach those other\nissues if we wish.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It's ultimately a matter of\nthe Court's discretion. Our submission is that the\nwiser exercise of the Court's discretion would not --\nwould be not to address the issue, particularly the last\nissue raised in respondent's brief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the only thing\nthat the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a\ntheft offense in California is broader than the generic\ndefinition of theft. All of these arguments that are\nbeing discussed are ways in which that particular ruling\nis supported. I don't know why they wouldn't be\nconsidered subsumed under the Ninth Circuit's decision.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we\ndon't read the Ninth Circuit's order that way. We think\nthe Ninth Circuit simply reversed on the strength of its\nprior decision in Penuliar. And in Penuliar, the Ninth\nCircuit clearly held the reason this California statute\nwas not a theft offense was that conviction under it is\npossible under an aiding and betting liability theory.\nSo insofar as the order relied on Penuliar, it was\nsaying nothing more and nothing less than that\nrespondent's conviction was not a theft offense because\nit is theoretically possible he was convicted as an\naider and abettor and the definition of theft offense\nunder the INA does not include aiding and abetting.\nNow as I was saying, I think it's important\nfor the Court to make clear what it means to say, that\naiding and abetting is included in the aggravated felony\ndefinition. And this -- the type of argument that\nrespondent raises here, I think is important to keep in\nmind, is not limited to the particular aspect of aiding\nand abetting law on which he relies.\nThere are a great many different\nformulations of the basic requirements of aiding and\nbetting. Not only that they -- they vary not only from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction but even within\njurisdictions. So in the next case, you could imagine\nan alien or removal case arguing that because some other\nrequirement of aiding and abetting law in the\njurisdiction in which he was convicted is broader than\nthe more typical formulation, that even though he was\nclearly convicted of, for example, murder, and even\nthough the elements of murder in that jurisdiction\nperfectly match up with the federal definition of murder\nin the immigration statute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you're\nahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question,\nbut I take it your rationale for not reaching these\nother grounds would also apply to your argument that\nwhatever the categorical definition, that this defendant\nwas convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the\ncharging documents. That wasn't a basis for the Ninth\nCircuit's decision either.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Our main submission is that the Ninth Circuit\nrelied on an issue of aiding and abetting. We\npetitioned on that question and the Court granted\ncertiorari on that question.\nThe three grounds on which respondent relies\non defense of the judgment, even though they all vary in\nsome sense from the Ninth Circuit's ground, two of them\nsimply have nothing to do with aiding and abetting. The\nfirst ground is an aiding and abetting argument. It's\nslightly different from the one, slightly narrower than\nthe one on which the Ninth Circuit relied, but we think\nit's fairly included and we think the Court should\naddress it. We think the Court should reject it for the\nreasons I am attempting to articulate now.\nIf you have a jurisdiction with a law of\naiding and abetting that is broader, it can be\ncharacterized as broader in some sense than what might\nbe thought to be the general notion of aiding and\nabetting, under the premise of respondent's theory, you\ncould conceivably have this kind of argument in any\nremoval case --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if a particular\njurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally\ndifferent theory of aiding and abetting? Is it simply\nsufficient that it is labeled aiding and abetting?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Alito, we\nthink it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to\nleave open the question that if at some point in the\nfuture, some entirely novel radical far-reaching theory\nof aiding and abetting were adopted, that would not be\nsufficient. I don't think as the law currently stands\nthere is any such theory in any jurisdiction; and I\nthink that Congress should be presumed when it enacted\nthe aggravated felony provision, to be covering the\nfield of possibilities. But if at some point in the\nfuture some jurisdiction decided that, you know,\nsomebody could be strictly liable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Himmelfarb, what about\naccessory after the fact, do your comments apply to that\nargument as well?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think that that's\nnot fairly included within the question presented. We\nthink that's just a -- accessory after the fact is a\nseparate crime\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it may not be fairly\nincluded but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument\nasserted to defend the judgment.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. We think\nthat the Court could resolve that issue along the lines\nwe've suggested in our reply brief. Respondent's basic\nsubmission on that point is that the term -- the phrase\nin the California statute, any person who is a party or\nan accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or\nunauthorized taking or stealing, that in that phrase the\nterm accessory means accessory after the fact. An\naccessory after the fact is not included in the\ndefinition of the theft offense. Therefore, the\nCalifornia statute is broader than a theft offense.\nIt's our submission that the Court can assume that he's\nright about that but still rule for the government on\nthe accessory after the fact issue, because whatever the\nstatute might say, he was charged as a principal. And\nthe law is clear that somebody charged as a principal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know that? I\nwas looking at, what is it, 13-A? How do we know that\nthat charge is as a principal? In the appendix to the\npetition.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it\ntracks the language of the statute up to the point where\nthe statute uses the phrase I just read.\nSo it's principal language. It's\ntheoretically possible that he was convicted as an aider\nand abettor because the law in California, as it is\nelsewhere, is that somebody charged as a principal can\nbe convicted as an aider and abettor; but the law in\nCalifornia, as it is elsewhere, is that somebody charged\nas a principal cannot be convicted as an accessory after\nthe fact. There is no language in the charging\ninstrument to suggest that respondent was charged as an\naccessory after the fact.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But to accept your answer,\nwe've got to look into a question of California pleading\nlaw which hasn't been passed on below.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right.\nRespondent raises a number of arguments in response\nessentially to the argument I just made. We think\nthey're all entirely insubstantial and could be rejected\nquite easily. But it may well be that the Court would\nthink that the better course is not to address the\naccessory after the fact issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't the better\ncourse be also not to decide the principal question you\nwant us to decide on the broad ground that you want us\nto take, which is that if there are minor differences\nbetween what you might call the general law of aiding\nand abetting, it doesn't matter. Why wouldn't it be\nwiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind\nof consequential liability is part of the general law of\naiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief?\nSo that would be the narrower ground.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That would be narrower\nground. That is certainly our fallback position and we\nwould not be at all unhappy if the case were resolved on\nthat ground.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though that position\nhas been widely criticized, I think. Is it the\nALI Model Penal Code, which thinks it's a bad rule?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: There has been some\ncriticism of the rule, Justice Ginsburg, but it is\napplied in criminal cases in Federal courts; and\nwhatever criticism there might be in the academic\nliterature, even in some state decisions, we think it is\njust inconceivable that Congress would have intended\nthat somebody could be convicted under this theory under\nthe Federal criminal law and be subject to the same\ncriminal penalties as a principal, and yet under the\nfederal immigration law could not be subject to the same\nimmigration consequences as a principal. So whatever\ngrounds there are for criticizing it, it is the law in\nmost places. And most importantly, we think, it is the\nlaw in Federal courts.\nTaking account of minor variations in\nformulation of aiding and abetting standards among\njurisdictions would not only have the consequence of\ndrastically limiting the number of aliens who could be\nfound to be aggravated felons, because of the difficulty\nof establishing that someone was convicted as a\nprincipal rather than an aider and abettor. It would\nalso complicate removal cases enormously, as I\nmentioned.\nThe premise of respondent's aiding and\nabetting theory would suggest that in any case, it would\nbe necessary for the immigration judge, board of\nimmigration appeals and the reviewing court, to engage\nnot only in an analysis of whether the principal offense\nof conviction matches some Federal definition, which\nitself can be a quite complex enterprise, but having\ndone that, it would then have to go on and compare the\naiding and abetting law of the state of conviction with\nsome Federal aiding and abetting law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In that former question as\nto whether California theft is general theft, do you\npropose the same rule? That even if California has some\nminor variations -- not just in aiding and abetting but\nin what constitutes theft -- minor variations from what\nthe general national rule is, they should be\ndisregarded? And if not, why not?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think that -- we\ndon't, first of all.\nAnd I think no court would say that and we\ncertainly wouldn't. But there's a very important\ndifference insofar as that type of comparison was\nconcerned between on the one hand a principal offense\nand on the other hand aiding and abetting. The two\nimportant differences are if you have a general\ndefinition of the principal offense, whether it's a\ntheft offense or burglary, any reasonable framework\nwould contemplate that in a great many cases you would\nbe able to tell whether the alien before the court was\nconvicted of that offense, of the Federal definition of\nthat offense, simply by looking at the State statute of\nconviction; and if it matches it, that's the end of the\nanalysis. If it's broader, in most cases you'd be able\nto look at the charging instrument and see whether that\nperson was charged with something narrower than the\nwhole range of conduct that's covered by the statute.\nUnder respondent's theory, if you were\nto apply that same approach to aiding and abetting you\nwould never be able to look at the statute to see\nwhether somebody was convicted under an aiding and\nabetting theory that matches the Federal definition\nbecause every statute includes aiding and abetting, so\nit's impossible to tell from the statute whether\nsomebody was convicted as a principal or an aider and\nabettor.\nThen if you look at the charging\ninstrument, that won't suffice either because the law\neverywhere as far as I'm aware is that somebody charged\nas a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor.\nSo the only cases in which you'd be able to establish\nthat somebody was not convicted as an aider and abettor\nare the unusual cases where there happens to be\nsomething in the files of the criminal case that will\nexplain in some admissible fashion whether the defendant\nwas convicted as a principal or an aider and abettor.\nThat's the first important distinction. The second --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you would limit your\nrule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor\nvariations, just minor variations in the aiding and\nabetting definition?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. I mean, our\nsubmission is that Congress's intent in enacting an\naggravated felony provision that captures aiders and\nabettors was that minor variations in formulation\nwouldn't matter for the reasons I'm giving. So it's\nultimately a matter of Congressional intent.\nThe second reason why this is important is\nbecause if you were to apply that rule to aiding and\nabetting you would be saying, in effect, that in any\njurisdiction that applies a broader rule of aiding and\nabetting every single crime in the criminal code would\nnot qualify for aggravated felony status, because an\naiding and betting statute runs with the entirety of the\ncriminal code and is a potential theory of liability for\nevery substantive criminal offense. So that would mean\nthat in those, those broader aiding and abetting\njurisdictions, nothing could ever be an aggravated\nfelony unless the government could somehow search\nthrough the criminal files and find something to prove\nthat in fact the defendant was not convicted under an\naiding and abetting theory.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Himmelfarb, before\nyour time runs out, there's something curious about this\nCalifornia statute. This one is in the Motor Vehicle\nCode, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called\ncar theft. Do you know what the difference between\nthose two and what would move a prosecutor to charge\nunder the Penal Code as opposed to the Vehicle Code?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the theft offense\nthat covers cars under than this one in California that\nI'm aware of, Justice Ginsburg, is just a grand theft\nstatute, which is just general theft as applied to\nparticular circumstances, one of which is the theft of a\ncar.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's mentioned in what,\n487(d)?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. That's\nright. And as I understand it, that is essentially a\nlarceny statute, which encompasses a common law larceny\nrule, which is that there has to be an intent to steal\nor, stated differently, that there has to be an intent\nto deprive the owner of the car, of the car permanently,\nwhereas the California vehicle theft statute at issue\nhere is a broader statute in that it doesn't require any\nintent to steal. It doesn't even require a taking. A\ndriving is sufficient. So it would capture the receipt\nof stolen property. And it doesn't require an intent to\ndeprive the owner of the car permanently. It would be\nsufficient if there was an intent to deprive the owner\nof the car temporarily.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It covers joyriding?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it would cover -- it\nwould cover what is colloquially known as joyriding if\nit fell within the terms of the statute. That is, if\nthere was an intent to deprive the owner of the\nproperty. And on the subject of joyriding, let me --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Temporarily.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: At least temporarily.\nRespondent makes much of the fact that on\nour reading of the statute, on our understanding, that a\ntheft offense would cover the California vehicle theft\nstatute here. That would mean that joyriding would be\nincluded. But I think it's critical to keep in mind\nthat there are two very important limitations in the\nFederal definition of theft offense. The first is that,\nas interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals, it\ndoes require an intent to deprive the owner of property,\nand a great many unauthorized use of vehicle statutes in\nthe State don't have that element. That's one important\nlimitation.\nThe other is that many of these statutes are\nmisdemeanor statutes, so somebody convicted of it would\nnot be sentenced to more than a year in prison. By the\nterms of the theft offense provision of the aggravated\nfelony provision in the INA you have to be sentenced to\nat least a year in prison in order to be treated as an\naggravated felon. So we think the vast majority of what\nis colloquially known as joyriding cases would not fall\nwithin this particular aggravated felony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in California they\nwould? Or is there a separate joyriding --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. Joyriding in\nCalifornia would be prosecuted under this statute. But\nunless there was an intent to deprive, there could be no\nconviction, and unless the sentence was at least a year\nit would not be treated as an aggravated felony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the sentence given or\nthe sentence prescribed for the crime?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: The sentence given, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Given.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I'd like to reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nMr. Meade.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to pick up on the point made by\nJustice Ginsburg. This case does not involve a\nconviction under California's car theft statute, which\nis Penal Code 487(d), which requires an intent to steal.\nRather, it involves a conviction under California's\nVehicle Code, which covers varied and less serious\nconduct including liability with or without the intent\nto steal and also expressly reaching accessories after\nthe fact, which the Government concedes would make it\nbroader than the generic definition of theft.\nThe question is whether a conviction under\nthis statute is a theft offense and therefore an\naggravated felony triggering the extremely serious\nconsequences of automatic deportation from the United\nStates, a permanent bar from the United States, and in\nthe sentencing context a sentencing enhancement from 2\nto 20 years for illegal reentry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend began\nhis argument by saying you don't defend the decision of\nthe Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting. Is that\ncorrect?\nMR. MEADE: We do defend the judgment of the\nNinth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know the judgment,\nbut you focused at least primarily on other grounds than\nthe one on which the Ninth Circuit relied.\nIs he correct that you concede that merely\nbecause the statute extends to aiders and abettors that\nis not sufficient to take it out of the categorical\ntreatment?\nMR. MEADE: As an abstract general matter\ndivorced from the facts of this case and divorced from\nCalifornia law, we agree that aiding and abetting\nliability is part of a generic definition of any crime,\nincluding the theft offense here.\nHowever, that's not what the Ninth Circuit\nstated in either this case or in Penuliar. In Penuliar\nthe Ninth Circuit stressed the extremely broad nature of\nCalifornia's aiding and abetting liability. It cited a\ncase, People v. Beeman, which refers to the specific\nnatural and probable consequences doctrine under\nCalifornia law.\nSo the Ninth Circuit was talking about the\nbroad sweep of aiding and abetting liability under\nCalifornia law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask a factual\nquestion? I'm just curious. If the Government's\nstatement of the facts here is correct, your client, a\nPeruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and\nconvicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994,\nand nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in\n1998. How does that happen? Is that a mistake or --\nhow do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent\nresident?\nMR. MEADE: I don't know the answer to the\nquestion except to state that those two, those\nconvictions did happen in the years that you state and\nhe did become a lawful permanent resident in 1998.\nI believe it was through a waiver provision\nunder the INA that that's how he became a lawful\npermanent resident.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's not a joyrider anyway.\nMR. MEADE: I would disagree with that. All\nwe know in this case from the record is that he was not\ncharged with 487(d) car theft, which requires an intent\nto steal. He was rather charged under a conviction\nwhich covers joyriding.\nIn my reading of the Government's brief, the\nGovernment doesn't contest that joyriding would put a\nstatute outside the generic definition of theft offense.\nEven in the Government's presentation today, the\nGovernment suggested that in most States joyriding would\nbe outside the generic definition of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then the Ninth Circuit\nwas wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft\nas the taking or exercising control over property\nwithout consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of\nrights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent\nor total? They're wrong in your opinion?\nMR. MEADE: No, I don't think they're wrong.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, I don't see\nhow you make --\nMR. MEADE: Sure. I'd be happy to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that\ninconsistent with what you just said?\nMR. MEADE: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. MEADE: No, it's not inconsistent. We\ndon't take the position that a permanent deprivation is\nrequired, is required. A less than permanent\nis sufficient, as the Ninth Circuit stated in\nCorona-Sanchez. The Ninth Circuit has subsequently held\nthat a joyriding offense is outside that definition\nbecause it includes a brief taking with an intent to\nreturn, and the last footnote of the Government's brief,\nnote 8, cites that Ninth Circuit case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand how that\ncould be right, though. I mean, when you joyride it's\nless than personal. In other words, their definition is\nif you take somebody else's property for an hour that\nthat isn't theft, but if you take it for a day it is?\nMR. MEADE: The question has to do with how\nlong of the taking. And at common law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to -- is\nthere a common law, because they're trying to report --\nis under the common law there a rule or any generic rule\nthat says if you take somebody else's property for a\ncouple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for\nseveral hours or several days it is theft?\nMR. MEADE: There is a generic rule on this,\nand there is a consensus among the vast majority of\nStates. I point to both Professor LeFave as well as the\nModel Penal Code. And what these rules say -- and this\nis true in the vast majority of States, 42 States by our\ncount -- is that if you take either permanently or for\nan unreasonable amount of time such that it would\ndeprive the owner of the significant portion of the\neconomic value, then that constitute a theft offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You shouldn't steal it for\nan unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable\namount of time?\nMR. MEADE: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand the\nconcept of stealing something for a reasonable amount of\ntime.\nMR. MEADE: Well, I mean, that goes to the\nexact point, Justice Scalia, because we're not -- the\nquestion is what is stealing. The question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that the rule\nis something is theft only if you take it long enough to\ndeprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?\nMR. MEADE: Or a reasonable time, or to\nplace --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Wait. I want\nto know where that comes from, because I would think I\nhave a Volvo. It lasts for about 30 years, apparently.\nSo I guess if you took my car for a year, that that then\nwould not be a theft, or maybe it would be. Where is\nthe source of the rule you just cited?\nMR. MEADE: The source is the generic\ndefinition as applied in all of the States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I want a book. I\nwant a book that will tell me that if they take my car\nfor a month it isn't theft, but if they take it for a\nyear it is. What book, or where do I look to verify\nthat this is common law? I'm not denying what you're\nsaying. I just want to know where to look.\nMR. MEADE: Sure. Two sources. One would\nbe Professor LeFave in his discussion of what the intent\nrequired for the different theft offenses; and the\nsecond source would be the Model Penal Code when it sets\nforth the requisite mens rea for theft offenses.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was the third\nreference to the Model Penal Code, so I have to ask. No\none's enacted the Model Penal Code, have they?\nMR. MEADE: No. But in Taylor and in\nSeidler this Court used the Model Penal Code as a\nshorthand for the generic definition of a certain crime.\nBut we don't rely on the Model Penal Code.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe\nthe Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or\naspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence\nof general law?\nMR. MEADE: I would say that the Model Penal\nCode is consistent with the majority view. On this\nquestion of intent to steal, as we set forth in our\nbrief, 42 States hold what we say the law is, that an\nintent to steal -- a theft offense requires a mens rea\nmore than taking with an intent to give back.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You assert, you assert it's\nconsistent with the majority view on this issue, not on\neverything. What does it say about the death penalty?\nMR. MEADE: I'm not sure what it says about\nthe death penalty. On this issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that what\njoyriding is? That when you're done with your joy ride,\nyou return the car where you picked it up? I thought\nthey just abandoned it wherever you happen to be.\nMR. MEADE: If you abandon the car wherever\nyou happen to be that's not joy riding. That's covered\nby traditional larceny principles. In the, the case of\nState v. Davis from 1875 involves that exact principle.\nThat is larceny in that case. But however, if someone\ntakes a car, a teenager, a neighbor takes a car, drives\nit around the block, brings it back to the same place,\nthat is joyriding. That is covered by 108.51.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the joy in\nthat?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The joy apparently is you\ndon't get convicted of theft.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MEADE: But what we have here is statute\nthat criminalized conduct less serious than car theft.\nThis is -- 108.51 is the only statute in California that\ncovers joyriding. There's a whole different provision\nthat deals with car theft. In cases where that's the\nappropriate charge, prosecutors will charge the person\nwith car theft and meet the burden of proof. Here we're\ndealing with a less serious crime, a less serious\nstatute and the question is whether this statute that\nrequire a very minimal mens rea, with or without intent\nto steal, is sufficient to lead to the very serious\nconsequences of being an aggravated felony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you understand\nthat point to be what the Ninth Circuit relied on?\nMR. MEADE: No. Absolutely not. The Ninth\nCircuit didn't rely on that. It was presented to the\nNinth Circuit but the Ninth Circuit did not rely on\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we decided on\nthe question, the aiding and abetting question, they did\ndecide this would available to you to argue on remand?\nMR. MEADE: Uh, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because you\npresented it to the Ninth Circuit below.\nMR. MEADE: Yes, it would.\nI would like to also to address the question\nof accessory liability under California law.\n108.51 expressly covers accessories. The\nGovernment concedes that if that term means accessory\nafter the fact, then this statute is outside the generic\ndefinition of a theft offense. Under California law,\naccessory has only one meaning, and that one meaning is\naccessory after the fact. On that ground alone, this\nstatute is broader than a generic definition of theft\noffense and would provide a -- an alternate ground of\naffirmance in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Meade, the Government\nsays that definition holds for penal code offenses, but\nit's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal\ncode would carry over to the vehicle code.\nMR. MEADE: I have two responses,\nJustice Ginsburg. First, there's a similar provision to\n108.51 covering the taking or operating of an airplane.\nIt is in the penal code. It is 499(b). It exactly\nmirrors the language of 108.51. So presumably the\nGovernment would agree that the definition of accessory\nunder California law in the penal code would cover\n499(b) for the same reasons it would cover under 108.51.\nMoreover, accessory under California law only has one\nmeaning. In 1872 the California legislature passed the\nprovision at issue, Section 32 and said accessory is\ndefined to be accessory after the fact. At the same\ntime, the legislature passed other provisions which also\nused accessory in that consistent way.\nThe California Supreme Court as early as\n1898 stated that accessory means accessory after the\nfact and relatedly, accessory before the fact, the only\nother plausible meaning of the term, has no meaning\nunder California law.\nSo with all due respect to the Government,\naccessory in 108.51 means accessory after the fact and\nthat alone makes a broad and generic definition of theft\noffense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So wouldn't it odd for this\nCourt to decide that issue of California law?\nMR. MEADE: I wouldn't think it would be\nodd, Justice Alito, because it is so clear. It has to\ndo with a statutory term. It has to do with a statutory\nterm that's defined under the California statute.\nMoreover, under a Taylor inquiry, Federal courts are\noften required to look at state law to figure out\nwhether a particular provision is within or outside a\ngeneric definition of a crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course if you're right\nabout this it would mean the statute is broader, but it\nwould still be available to find out whether your client\nwas in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.\nMR. MEADE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now is that -- is it\npossible? Or is that out of the question in this case?\nMR. MEADE: I'm sorry. Is what possible?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it possible from\npleading documents, from the charge, to determine\nwhether he was convicted as an accessory or not? And if\nit's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our\nsometime in arguing this point, aren't we?\nMR. MEADE: I disagree. Because as an\ninitial matter, this case in our view is about the\ncategorical approach. But as to your question about\nwhat these documents show, no, the documents in this\ncase do show that he was an accessory after the fact or\na principal, but the Government has failed to meet its\nburden one way or the other.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they say you\ncannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are\ncharged as such, and that the documents show he was\ncharged as a principal.\nMR. MEADE: We disagree with that\ncharacterization of the Government as we set forth in\nour brief. California law does not require someone to\nbe charged with that specific -- level of specificity.\nAnd that's something we set forth in our brief.\nMoreover --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well how about how -- how\nthe defendant was charged in this very case?\nMr. Himelfarb thought that it was plain from that\ncharge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a\nprincipal. And you must take the view that this charge,\nthis information was inadequate to identify him as\nprincipal.\nMR. MEADE: This charge is ambiguous as to\nwhether he was charged as a driver and taker, as the\nprincipal, or as an accessory after the fact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. It says, \"who\nat the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and\nunlawfully drive or take a vehicle.\" I mean, he is --\nhe's charged with being the person who took the vehicle,\nnot, not some subsequent accessory.\nMR. MEADE: Well, this is a question of\nCalifornia law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not a question of Cal\n-- it is a question of English.\nMR. MEADE: No, I disagree, Your Honor. I\nmean, it's a question of California law what needs to be\ncharged in a California charging document.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not saying about what\nneeds to be charged. We're talking about what was\ncharged. And it seems to me there's no question what\nwas charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully\ndrive or take a vehicle. There is no way you can\nconsider that an accessory.\nMR. MEADE: Well, I disagree. Because under\nCalifornia law you need to charge generally under the\nstatute, and the statute says drive or take. That's how\nhe was charged. Moreover, though, under California law,\nthe charging document does not necessarily control the\nconviction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're -- you're\nsaying then despite the fact that the, the indictment in\nthis case said he willfully et cetera did this, it would\nbe open to California to prove that in fact he didn't do\nany of those things, but was merely an accessory after\nthe fact? That -- that's your position? That's what\nCalifornia pleading law allows?\nMR. MEADE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS? Do you have any case on\nthat?\nMR. MEADE: Yes. People v West and People v\nToro.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Both West and Toro.\nMR. MEADE: Yes. W-e-s-t, and People v\nToro. There's also the case of Sandoval which is also\ncited in our brief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does any of those cases\nsquarely hold that he could be convicted of being an\naccessory after the fact on a general indictment like\nthis?\nMR. MEADE: No, none of them do. They talk\nabout the general principle under California law, about\nthat a charging document does not necessarily control\nthe ultimate conviction and sets forth the test that\nneeds to be applied. But on this question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Government\n-- it is not only that. The Government has authority\ngoing the other way. People versus Prado, \"in the\nabsence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must\nbe indicted and convicted as such.\" If you look at this\ninformation, it's clear that he's not being indicted as\nan accessory after the fact.\nMR. MEADE: Well, we think People v Prado\nsupports our view which is a statute specifically that\nallows for accessory liability on its face. So,\ntherefore, a person need not be charged under the\ndifferent accessory statute.\nHowever, to the extent this Court finds the\ncharging documents or ultimate conviction ambiguous,\nwhich it sounds like some members of the Court may\nbelieve it is, this is a question of California law, as\na first point; but moreover, the question here is\nwhether the Government has met its burden under Taylor\nand Shepard. And under Taylor and Shepard the inquiry\nis whether it can necessarily be shown that someone was\nconvicted of a generic definition; and here, given the\nambiguity under California law, it can't be said that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what do we do about\nthat? No, you have no interest in answering my\nquestion, but the question, it seems to me under the\nlaw, here is what I do -- and I'm a good deference\nlawyer, as you are. I simply look at the statute. And\nI imagine some very weird case that the statute could\ncover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or\nit wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing.\nThere's no possibility in the world that applied to my\nclient. But most charges are simply stated in the\nwording of the statute. And most judgments simply say\nguilty.\nSo I say \"see, you see, it is theoretically\npossible.\" And now when you decide what really\nhappened, Court, you're supposed to look only to the\ncharging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it\ndidn't. So the whole congressional scheme is basically\nput to the side.\nNow what's the answer to that problem,\ninsofar as you want to answer it?\nMR. MEADE: Of course, I'd be happy to. I\ndon't think it puts the whole scheme aside. Remember,\nthe Government gets two bites at the apple here. They\nget a first bite on the categoric approach where all\nthey need to show is that all the elements are within\nthe generic definition of the crime. We'd be dealing\nwith a different case if the person was charged under\nthe penal code which doesn't require -- which requires\nintent to steal and which does not cover accessories\nafter the fact. So the Government gets a free pass on\nround one.\nOn round two, on the modified categorical\napproach as we're discussing here, the Government gets a\nsecond chance to -- based on actual documents in the\nrecord to establish whether there's enough there.\nHere the Government relies on the charging\ndocument in an abstractive judgment, but the Government\ndoes not put in a plea colloquy, it does not put in plea\nallocution, it does not put in any other documents that\nwould establish under Shepard that someone was\nnecessarily convicted of the crime. So what -- the\nGovernment here is asking to be relieved of its burden\nof proof which it has in this case. I would like to\nnote that on the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the charging document\nyou acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California\nlaw that in order to convict as an accessory you have to\ncharge as an accessory? You would acknowledge this?\nMR. MEADE: Yes. I would acknowledge the\ncharging document unto itself, but not taking into\naccount the fact that the charging document and the\nconviction not match.\nI would note, though, that the Court need\nnot go to the modified categorical approach, and I would\nsay should not. This is something that the board -- the\nagency has been able to deal with for 60 years or so,\ndealing with the actual documents, trying to figure out\na whether particular charging document is or is not\nenough. In Shepard itself, which actually dealt with\nthe question of which documents could or could not be\nconsidered, the Court did not go further and look at the\nnext step and decide whether those particular documents\ndid or did not meet the definition in that case.\nI'd also like to note to the extent that\nthis Court finds California charging law ambiguous or\nhard to understand, under the principle of Jett v Dallas\nIndependent School District, the circuit courts are in a\nbetter position to consider a matter of California State\nlaw in the first instance.\nSo our accessory argument is that the Court\nshould decide the categorical approach alone on the\naccessory after the fact ground and remand to the agency\nfor consideration under the modified approach.\nI'd like to also stress that if the Court\nwere to affirm on that ground it would be a very narrow\nholding. There's only two other statutes in California\nthat expressly include accessories after the fact.\nCalifornia's car theft statute does not include\naccessories after the fact.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In order to agree with you\non the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide\ntwo disputed issues of California law? Whether\naccessory here in this statute means accessory after the\nfact, and whether if somebody is charged under that\nstatute as an accessory, that has to be alleged\nspecifically in the indictment, or whether it is just\nsufficient to charge the person with the offense.\nMR. MEADE: The Court would only need to\ndecide that first question, not the second question.\nThe first question is what is the meaning of accessory\nunder California law. That is sufficiently clear in our\nview that the Court need not send it back to the Court\nof Appeals. The second question under the modified\napproach is outside the core of what this case is about,\nand we suggest that that should be remanded to the Ninth\nCircuit or the agency.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has anyone ever been\nprosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?\nMR. MEADE: I do not know one way or the\nother, Your Honor. But I also note that we don't know\nwhether anyone has been prosecuted under 108.51 on that\nground, we also do not know whether someone has been\nprosecuted under Section 32, which is the accessory\nafter the fact provision, or more generally on that\nground.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if no one has\never been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for\njoyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to\nconstrue this charging document which charges him as a\nprincipal as actually meaning to charge him as an\naccessory after the fact, wouldn't we?\nMR. MEADE: Not necessarily, because what we\nhave is a statutory provision that clearly covers\naccessories after the fact. We do not have an example\nof someone who was charged under 108.51, but there are\nmany reasons why that may not show up, partly because\nthe charging documents don't need to so provide, in our\nview. So figuring out who was and who was not an\naccessory after the fact or a principal under 108.51 is\nnot so easy to distill.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you been able to think\nof any examples where a person could have been,\nconvicted of this statute, under the statute would he\nactually have been some kind of accessory to another\nperson committing another crime, and the natural and\nprobable consequence was that that other person would\nviolate this statute?\nMR. MEADE: So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you been able to think\nof one?\nMR. MEADE: Sure. So you're switching to\nthe natural and probable consequences?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I am.\nMR. MEADE: Yes, and I thank you for that\nquestion. Someone who, say, could aid and abet, or have\nthe intent to aid and abet purchasing alcohol for a\nminor, a natural and probable consequence of that could\nbe joyriding.\nI would also like to -- turning to the\nquestion of the natural and probable consequences\ndoctrine, the government is incorrect when it states\nthat the majority view accepts the natural and probable\nconsequences.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are there cases that hold\nthat the natural and probably consequences of purchasing\nalcohol for a minor could be joyriding?\nMR. MEADE: We have not found a case on\nthat. However --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Or anything else that\nsomebody might do after getting intoxicated?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Partying maybe I would\nunderstand. I don't know about joyriding.\nMR. MEADE: The natural and probable\nconsequences theory cuts across a wide variety of\ncrimes, as the government points out. So it would also\ncover the different provisions under the INA such as\nburglary, theft, and other provisions as well. The\ngovernment, though, is incorrect in stating that the\nnatural and probable consequences is a majority view.\nEven in its brief, the government only sets forth 22\nstates that it says apply that analysis.\nThose 22 states that the government cites,\nmany of them do not support the proposition that it is a\nmajority view or even applied in those states. For\nexample, just to give a couple of examples, the\ngovernment cites Missouri as a state that applies the\nnatural and probable consequences doctrine. However in\nMissouri, in the very case cited by the government,\nPeople v. Evans, the court rejects the use of the\nnatural and probable consequences doctrine and says,\n\"The use of the natural and probable consequences\ndoctrine was error as a matter of law.\"\nThe same is true -- and that's on the same\npage the government cites. The same is true with\nrespect to Maryland, where the same footnote that the\ngovernment cites rejects the natural and probable\nconsequences doctrine in favor of a narrower theory.\nIt's also true in Idaho, Louisiana, Georgia and Texas,\nalso do not apply the natural and probable consequences\ndoctrine.\nSo what, the government here is seeking to\nhold someone guilty of a theft offense as an aggravated\nfelony without the requisite mens rea, and something\nthat's a minority view of the states.\nJust to put this into context, under the\nnatural and probable consequences doctrine, it's as if\nCalifornia passed a statute saying that in some cases\nsomeone can be guilty of burglary without the mens rea\nof burglary, or saying that one can be guilty of theft\nwithout the mens rea of theft.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument isn't\nlimited to theft offenses, correct? That would cut\nacross all of these areas in which the federal law\nrefers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?\nMR. MEADE: Yes, it would. So it would not\nnecessarily apply to the non-Taylor provisions such as\nthe one --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would mean we\ncould not rely on the categorical approach in almost any\nof those cases?\nMR. MEADE: As -- on the first step, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, the\ncategorical approach.\nMR. MEADE: It does mean that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, what's an\nexample of where you're held guilty on the ground that\nyou aided and abetted natural and probable -- somebody\ndid X and the natural and probable consequence was\nY. Because after all, you are properly held guilty when\nyou do an act and a known consequence is Y. So what's an\nexample of that?\nMR. MEADE: Sure. I'd be happy to give a\nnumber of examples.\nJUSTICE BREYER: One would be good enough.\nThe best one.\nMR. MEADE: If you intend to aid and abet\nrobbery, you intend to aid and abet robbery, you can be\nheld liable for an unintended rape of another. If you\naid and abet --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a known and probable\nconsequence? That's a probable consequence?\nMR. MEADE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, maybe the\nproblem is that they don't define natural and probable\nconsequence properly.\nMR. MEADE: Well, this is how it's applied\nunder California law. To give another example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. That's a\nreal case?\nMR. MEADE: That's a real case, and I'll\ngive you the cite. People v. Banks, 2002 Westlaw 192,\n720. There's another case cited in our brief, aid and\nabet robbery, natural probable consequence, sex\noffenses, that's the People v. Nguyen case. Another\nexample, a person who has the intention to aid and abet\nbattery, beating someone up, can be held guilty for an\nunintended robbery.\nAnd to show how stark this is, this is in\nCalifornia, it's broader than even the common law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like the doctrine\nof unnatural improbable consequences.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're asking us to say\nthat not only do the states have to have the same rule,\nbut they have to interpret the rule the same way. This\nwould make the application of the categorical approach\nimpossible. You'd have to look not only to the\nexpression of the rule of law by the state courts, but\nto its application by the state courts in every\njurisdiction. I mean, that just makes the whole\nenterprise infeasible, it seems to me.\nMR. MEADE: What the Taylor analysis looks\nto is what's in the heartland of a certain crime, and\nhere what's in the heartland of aiding and abetting.\nAnd what we have here is an aberrant doctrine of\nCalifornia law that is outside the mainstream.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me tell you, what's\naberrant is the California interpretation of the\nstandard doctrine that is used in many states, which is\nyou intend the natural and probable consequences of what\nyou do. And if California has, some California courts\nhave come up with weird notions of that, I don't know\nthat that destroys the uniformity among the states.\nMR. MEADE: Just to briefly respond?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, sir.\nMR. MEADE: The rule that you state is that\none intends the natural and probable consequences of\none's own acts. We do not dispute this rule. The\nquestion is as applied to aiding and abetting liability,\nand California is one of a handful of states that\napplies the natural and probable consequences doctrine\nto aiding and abetting liability, which has the novel\nand aberrant consequences of holding people liable even\nif they don't have the requisite mens rea for the\noffense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Meade.\nMr. Himelfarb, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be completely\ninconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to\nsay that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of\npotential liability such as proposed by the respondent,\nwhich would exonerate him from application of this\nstatute, that he has the burden to show that that's what\nhappened?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would Taylor allow us to\ndo that sort of burden shifting?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well ultimately,\nJustice Kennedy, we don't think that Taylor controls on\nthe question of what Congress's intent was under the\nINA. Ultimately Taylor was a question about Congress's\nintent in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, and\nevery aspect of that decision was tied in some way to\nCongress's intent there.\nWe think Congress's intent in enacting the\naggravated felony provision of the INA has to be that it\ndidn't intend that you would have these highly arcane\ncomparisons of some general definition of aiding and\nabetting, which either would or wouldn't include the\ninfinite variety of formulations of aiding and abetting.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so your general rule\nto accomplish your objective would be?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It's the one I suggested\nwhen I was up here earlier, which is a holding by this\nCourt that Congress intended to include aiding and\nabetting liability in the aggravated felony provision,\nand intended to cover whatever formulations were extant\nin 1988 when the provision was enacted. The Court can\nleave open the possibility that if in some future case,\nsome jurisdiction were to enact an extraordinarily far\nreaching theretofore unheard of formulation, for\nexample, anybody who intentionally insists -- assists --\nwithout regard to whether the person even knew about the\nprinciples of criminal conduct, could be held liable as\nan aider and abettor. In that circumstance, it might\nwell be the case that a state, by adopting such a far\nreaching theory of aiding and abetting, would in effect\nforfeit the right to have any of the subsequent\nprovisions in its criminal code treated as aggravated\nfelonies unless the government in the immigration case\ncould somehow prove that the alien wasn't convicted as\nan aider and abettor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think that, the problem I\nguess that I have with your argument, is that the theory\nof Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that\nthere was a concept of a generic offense. And when\naiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural\nand probable consequences theory, we face the fact that\nregardless of what the actual count is, even on your\ncount, there isn't even a majority of states that do it.\nAnd I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore,\nform an element of a generic offense when it is -- or a\ngeneric concept of the offense -- when it is a minority\nview.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, even under our\nfallback position, Justice Souter, under which you would\nhave to come up with some general definition of aiding\nand abetting and then make a comparison with the law of\naiding and abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction.\nAnd even if it's, you know, 20-20 or 18-18 among the\nstates on this particular wrinkle in the law of aiding\nand abetting, we think it is frankly dispositive in this\ncase, that it is the Federal rule, and my friend\nMr. Meade has not disputed that.\nWe think it's just inconceivable that\nCongress would have intended that in a Federal criminal\ncase if you're charged with murder, you can be convicted\nunder a natural and probable consequences theory such\nthat you could conceivably spend life in prison the same\nway a principal would, and yet you would not be subject\nto the same immigration consequences as somebody\nconvicted of the principal offense of murder, and\nindeed, that you wouldn't even be able -- the government\nwouldn't be able to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why didn't we simply take\nthe closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I -- in Taylor?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that one of the\nproblems in Taylor was that there really is no Federal\ndefinition of burglary. That's part of it. The other\npart of it is to some extent, the Court did rely on the\nFederal definition in Taylor. The original version, the\noriginal version of the office statute defined burglary,\nand it defined it in a generic way which was broader\nthan the common law rule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was Taylor an immigration\ncase?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, it wasn't. It was a\ncriminal case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you are in effect, you\nwould say that the rule should be, or the modified\nTaylor rule for application here should be that it's\neither got to fall within the concept of the Federal\noffense, or in default of there being a comparable\nFederal offense, a generic offense defined by reference\nto state practice?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: May I answer the question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Our primary submission is\nthat in the context of aiding and abetting, there\nshouldn't be any generic definition beyond what the\nstates apply, whatever the formulation. Our fallback\nposition is essentially what you just described, and we\nthink we should prevail under it because we think we\nhave the Federal rule. We think we have the majority\nrule in the states. And we have the common law rule as\nwell.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
