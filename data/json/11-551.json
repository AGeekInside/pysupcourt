        "content": "(10:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in Case 11-551, Salazar, Secretary of the\nInterior v. Ramah Navajo Chapter.\nMr. Freeman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREEMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe funding dispute in the -- in this case\nis the result of two distinctive features of the ISDA's\nstatutory scheme. On the one hand, Congress has\nrequired the Secretary of the Interior to accept every\nself-determination contract proposed by an Indian tribe,\nprovided that the contract meets the requirements of the\nAct, without regard to the total number of contracts\ninto which the Secretary must enter.\nOn the other hand, in every fiscal year\nsince 1994, Congress has enacted an explicit statutory\ncap on the amount of money that the Secretary may use to\npay contract support costs under the ISDA and under\nthose contracts.\nNow, we think under the circumstances,\nCongress intended the Secretary to resolve these -- the\nrelationship between these provisions in exactly the way\nthat the Secretary has.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, but could the\nSecretary have done anything else?\nMR. FREEMAN: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the Secretary have\ndone anything else? There's an allegation that the\nSecretary in fact pays some contractors more than their\npro rata share, that it pays some nothing --\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- so that it's in\neffect acting -- I don't want to use the word\n\"arbitrarily\" -- but acting in whatever its best\ninterest is. So what protects the contracting party\nfrom that -- from that conduct, assuming it were to be\ncorrect?\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes, Your Honor. Well, the\nSecretary has promulgated a formal nationwide policy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It says it has a policy.\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the allegation is,\nis that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay\npeople some more than others.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right. And let me address\nthat. The allegation is, I think, at page 9 to 10 of\nRespondents' brief. Those allegations are, as a factual\nmatter, false. For example, they've given a couple of\nexamples where 0 percent contract support costs were\npaid. One of those examples is a contract where it had\nbeen entered into in that particular year. New\ncontracts are paid under a different appropriation.\nAnother example is they give a case of a tribe that was\npaid 352 percent of its contract support costs.\nAnd let me explain, I think it's\nimportant to understand how --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that --\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was my understanding\nthat that system that has been described as arbitrary\nwas not the one that was applicable to the years in\nquestion.\nMR. FREEMAN: That's right. At -- at the\ntime of the district court's ruling in this case, from\n1994 to about 2006, the Secretary followed a uniform pro\nrata distribution methodology according to the needs of\neach of the individual tribes. Now, that's what we\nthought the tribes wanted. We thought that was the\nfairest way to do it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All within the -- all\nwithin the dollar amount that was specified by the\nCongress in the \"not to exceed\" language.\nMR. FREEMAN: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor. Yes. So each tribe has an amount of need. This\nis the amount that is estimated. It's a negotiated\nfigure between the Secretary and each tribe. And it is\nundisputed that the amounts that Congress has been --\nhas appropriated have never been enough to pay 100\npercent of each of those figures for each member of the\nRespondent class.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't we have similar\nlanguage in Cherokee Nation? Didn't we say that that\nlanguage in Cherokee Nation, which was in the general\nappropriations statute, although not in each contract,\ndidn't mean that the Secretary could refuse to pay?\nMR. FREEMAN: No, Your Honor. We did not\nhave similar language in Cherokee, if you mean the\nAppropriations Act. It was under the same --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't mean the\nAppropriations Act. I mean -- I mean the general\nstatute that governed this program.\nMR. FREEMAN: No, that's right. And maybe\nit would be helpful if I could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why does it mean one\nthing there and mean something else when -- in the\nAppropriations Act?\nMR. FREEMAN: Well -- I may not be\nunderstanding Your Honor's question, but I -- I think it\nmight be helpful if I explain what was at issue in\nCherokee. In Cherokee, the government was not in this\nCourt making Appropriations Clause arguments. We were\nhere making a very different argument. It was\nundisputed in Cherokee that Congress had appropriated\nenough money for the unobligated available funds,\nlawfully available funds, for the Secretary to pay all\nof the contracts that were at issue.\nOur argument -- and to be sure, we thought\nwe were right -- our argument was that Congress had in\nother provisions of the Act allowed us to set aside a\ncertain amount of money that, albeit lawfully available\nto pay the contracts, we thought we could use to fund\nthe agency's inherent Federal operations. And the Court\nsaid: No, no, no. These are contracts. The money was\nlawfully available for you to pay, and there was no\nstatutory restriction against you paying it, so you had\nto pay it.\nAnd this case involves the circumstance\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how -- what was\nour reference in acceptance of the Ferris doctrine? And\nthe Ferris doctrine was almost identical to this\nsituation, where Congress allotted a certain amount to\nthe building of a particular dam, and the same -- we\napplied the Ferris principle and said even though they\ngave it to one type of contract, the dam, they were\npaying 1 percent less than others.\nMR. FREEMAN: No -- no, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where they had an\nallotment adequate enough to cover that individual.\nMR. FREEMAN: No. I think that's not quite\nan accurate characterization of Ferris. And it's\nimportant to understand what Ferris --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know what the Federal\nCircuit said. I don't think the Federal Circuit's\nright. If you read Ferris, that there was an\nappropriation for the dam.\nMR. FREEMAN: Ferris was an appropriation\nfor -- I think it was 40-some thousand dollars for\nimprovements to the Delaware River. And the government,\nthe Army Corps of Engineers, let out a contract for\n$37,000 to dredge the river. Then after the contract\nhad been let out -- and this is critical. If you stop\nthe movie at the time the contract was issued, there was\nsufficient funds to pay that contract. They were\nlawfully available. We obligated them to the -- to the\ncontractor.\nAnd then what happened in Ferris was, after\nthat lawful binding agreement was entered, agency\nofficials decided in their discretion that they'd prefer\nnot to spend the money on that, and they instead built a\nwharf or something.\nAnd what the Court said in Ferris -- and\nthis is -- we're not -- we have no quarrel with this\nprinciple -- is that when the funds are lawfully\navailable and you obligate them to a contractor without\nsome contingency, then you can't just decide to spend it\non something else. That's a breach. And it's not a\ndefense to the breach that at the end of the -- that at\nthe end, once you've breached the contract, there isn't\nenough money left in the appropriation to go back and\npay them what you should have.\nThat's different from this case, that there\nis not enough lawfully available money to pay every\nRespondent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but there wasn't\nin Ferris either. I mean, that was the problem. If the\nappropriations had been enough to cover that plus the\nlater expenditures, there would have been no problem.\nMR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, I think Ferris is\ncorrectly understood -- particularly given this Court's\nsubsequent decisions in Sutton, in Bradley, Leiter, and\nother cases, -- Ferris is correctly understood as\nsaying -- and this is the proposition, incidentally, for\nwhich the Court cited Ferris in Cherokee. Ferris is\nunderstood as saying if you've got a binding obligation\nin which you promised to pay money that is lawfully\navailable, Congress gave it to you, then if you, agency\nofficials, do something in your executive discretion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Lawfully available subject\nto appropriations. I mean, it was subject to\nappropriations.\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, in Ferris, there were --\nin fact, the contract was not made subject to\nappropriations. And one of the things the Federal\nCircuit pointed out was that the \"subject to the\navailability of appropriations\" language that is now\nubiquitous in government contracts was developed in part\nto make sure that the Ferris situation didn't later\narise.\nBut I want to underscore, if we know one\nthing in this case, we know that Congress intended for\nthe Secretary not to pay any more than the amounts in\nthe statutory caps.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Freeman, could I try a\nhypothetical on you? And it's -- it really is going to\nthis question of what Ferris means. So suppose that\nthere's a government program, and it's to purchase\nairplanes. And it's -- the authorization language says\nthis is subject to appropriations, in the same way that\nthis language does. And the government, under this\nprogram, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars\neach to buy 10 airplanes. But then it turns out that\nCongress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million.\nSo my question is: Now there are 10\ncontractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million\ndollars --\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- do those contractors have\ncontractual rights under Ferris?\nMR. FREEMAN: I -- Your Honor, it's going to\ndepend on a couple of things. And let me -- let me\nexplain. I think, because by hypothesis in your\nhypothetical we're entering into the contracts in\nadvance of appropriations, there is no right to be paid\nuntil the appropriations are made.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. So the appropriation\nhas been made. It's a $9 million appropriation.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right. And in that\ncircumstance, the agency cannot pay more than\n$9 million, and there is no binding obligation,\ncontractual obligation, on the government to pay more.\nLet me add something, though, in response --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So -- so either one of these\nairplane manufacturers is going to not have what he\ncontracted for, or all of them are not going to have\nwhat they contracted for, because everybody is going\nto -- their contract is going to be sliced.\nMR. FREEMAN: And, Your Honor, the reason\nwhy this is not a problem in real life is that there are\nother provisions in your ordinary procurement contracts,\nunder the ordinary kind of contracts that this case is\nnot, that take care of that.\nAnd the principal one is --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: My understanding,\nMr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that\nFerris said in that situation where it turns out that\nthere's a shortfall but where there are contractual\ncommitments, that -- that the government is bound to\nlive up to those contractual commitments. And if\nthere's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment\nFund.\nMR. FREEMAN: No. Your Honor, it -- there\nare a couple of things there. But let me first explain\nwhy as a practical matter that doesn't happen in\ncircumstances that are -- are not like this scheme where\nwe're required to enter into every contract. In your\nordinary government procurement scheme, there are\ntermination for convenience provisions.\nAnd, in fact, what happens in the\ncircumstances in which Your Honor posits is the\ngovernment terminates for convenience enough of the\ncontracts to make sure that we have the money to pay.\nAnd if we didn't do that, it would be a violation of the\nAntideficiency Act. And this Court has said many\ntimes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do the tribes have\nthe right to stop providing the services --\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that they've\ncontracted to?\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do they know that\nuntil they know what they're getting?\nMR. FREEMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning they don't know\nwhat they're getting.\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, they do know.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They signed a contract\nthat says you're going to pay them for their services to\ntheir members and for their administrative costs. They\nincur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the\ngovernment now says to them you've honored your part,\nbut we're not going to honor ours.\nMR. FREEMAN: No -- no, Your Honor.\nThat's -- that's not correct, and let me explain why.\nFirst, every contract that the -- every\nmember of the Respondent class signed in this case says\nthat the contractor's obligation to perform the services\nthat are at issue is subject to the availability of\nappropriated funds. That's Section (1)(c)(iii) of the\nmodel agreement that is read into every ISDA contract.\nThey further have the availability under\nSection (1)(b)(v) of that model agreement to stop at any\npoint if they're worried that there's not going to be\nenough money, and seek assurances from the Secretary\nthat there will be.\nNow, as to whether they know and when they\nknow how much money they're going to get, that was the\npoint of the 2006 distribution policy that the Secretary\nadopted. Under the pro rata system that we used for the\nfirst many years, the tribes said, look, we don't know\nhow pro rata is going to work out. So, in consultation\nwith the tribes, and, indeed, with the aid of several of\nthe counsel for the Respondent class, we drafted a\npolicy that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does the system do\nto the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici\nbrief, points to that are similar to these? Does this\nnow mean that moving forward, that every government\ncontractor who has a \"subject to appropriations\"\nlanguage takes the risk that at some point in the middle\nof the contract, the government's going to dishonor its\nobligation and pay it less than it said it would?\nMR. FREEMAN: No. No, Your Honor. And this\nis my --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do -- how do we\ndifferentiate those 50 other contracts?\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, I think they were citing\na number of different statutes in which the statutes\nprovide that funding is subject to the availability of\nappropriations.\nNow, it's important to underscore, that's\nwhy I started with this point. I don't believe in any\nof those statutory schemes is the government obligated\nto enter into every contract that comes in the door.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but that's partly why\nI asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort\nof wanted to see whether you would distinguish the\nhypothetical on that basis -\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- but you didn't. You said\nno, it really doesn't matter. Even if the government is\nnot obligated to enter into contracts, if the government\nhas entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those\nadditional appropriations.\nMR. FREEMAN: And, Your Honor, it is -- the\nunique features of this statutory scheme are absolutely\nimportant, but I want to -- I took Your Honor's question\nto be under the general appropriations principles that\nwe are describing, what would the result be? And I\nthink I'm right, but I should also add, as I said\nbefore, there are very strict fiscal controls in 31\nU.S.C. 1501, et sequitur, that make clear and prevent\nthe circumstance that Your Honor describes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, I'm not clear on\nwhat this hypothetical is. I thought her\nhypothetical -- Justice Kagan's -- was a situation where\nthe statute says, Mr. Secretary, you can spend no money\nbeyond what is appropriated.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the contract doesn't\nmention it. That's Ferris.\nI thought that the -- the real world is, in\ncontracting, you typically have both a statute that says\ndon't pay more than is appropriated --\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and in the contract, it\nsays, \"subject to appropriation,\" putting the\ncontracting party on notice.\nMR. FREEMAN: That's right. And -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So which were you\nanswering?\nMR. FREEMAN: I -- with respect to\nJustice Kagan, I believe we had a colloquy in which I\nsaid that because in her hypothetical we were entering\ninto the contracts in advance of appropriations, they\nwould have to be made express -- the contracts\nthemselves would have to be subject to the availability\nof appropriations in the contracts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The words in the contract\nare \"subject to appropriations.\"\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes. And without that, it\nwould be a violation of the Antideficiency Act --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FREEMAN: -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So in that world --\nnow we get to the question -- in that world, what\nhappens when 15 people each enter into such a contract\nfor $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be\ntoo small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay\nsome?\nMR. FREEMAN: Because, Your Honor, what I was\ntrying to answer is that, in your ordinary contractual\nscheme, the government solves that problem in a very\nstraightforward way. We terminate for convenience the\ncontracts -- enough of those contracts to ensure that we\nhave no obligations beyond the available appropriations.\nNow, we can't do that here, which is why\nthis is ultimately a question of congressional intent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we let\nCongress fix it? There are so many ways that\nCongress could fix this problem directly. By doing a\nline item allocation, it could take away the obligation\nto enter into these contracts and fully fund. It could\nbe much more direct --\nMR. FREEMAN: Your --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- than it's being,\ngiven the interpretation that you're advancing.\nMR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, I think it's\nimportant to understand what -- and maybe it would help\nif I took a minute to explain this -- what Congress was\ntrying to do in this statutory scheme.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was trying -- it was\ntrying to tell the tribes, we're honoring our obligation\nby paying you the costs, but we're really not going to\ndo it because we're going to let the government give you\nless?\nMR. FREEMAN: No. Look, Congress could --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have to assume\nCongress intends what it says. It intends to obligate\nyou to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make\nyou commit to paying their costs, correct?\nMR. FREEMAN: Not with -- yes. But\n450j-1(b) says, \"notwithstanding any provision of this\nAct, all funding under this Act is subject to the\navailability of appropriations.\"\nAnd let me explain why Congress would\nhave wanted to enact this statute that has some unusual\nfeatures. Congress, of course, could have said, we want\nto give every tribe the opportunity to enter -- to\nprovide services in its own name to its own people, but\nwe're going to do this on a regular contract basis,\nmeaning we'll just give us -- some to the Secretary.\nThe Secretary signs contracts as they come in until he\ndoesn't have any money left. And then any tribe after\nthat who asks for a -- for a contract, the Secretary\nsays no, we don't have the money to do it.\nBut Congress chose a -- a different\napproach. Congress wanted, as a matter of\nself-determination, to require the Secretary to give\nevery tribe who wants the ability to do this the\nopportunity to do it. But if it didn't then say all\nfunding is subject to the availability of\nappropriations, the result would be that the government\nwould be exposed to a liability that Congress could not\nestimate, because the ability of these tribes to pay for\noverhead costs and whatever varies tremendously from\ntribe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To what extent do you --\ndo you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up until now,\nbut Congress, in these appropriations, said \"not in\nexcess of.\"\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't just a general\n\"subject to appropriations.\" It was a specific amount,\nthe Secretary shall not pay in excess of a certain\ndollar amount for these costs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had exactly the same\nquestion. The \"not to exceed\" language, which I think\nis the word, \"not to exceed,\" hasn't been mentioned by\nyou yet because -- maybe you haven't had time.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREEMAN: That would be it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I thought that\nwas what Judge Dyk said --\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- was the critical -- the\ndifference between this and even the Cherokee case.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so my question is --\nis the same as Justice Ginsburg's. Isn't a principal\npart of your argument that this contract said not to\nexceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but\nlet's say $95 million?\nMR. FREEMAN: That -- that's exactly right,\nYour Honor.\nI mean -- and what I -- what I tried to\nanswer to a question earlier, it is absolutely clear\nwhat Congress was trying to do here. Congress said not\nto exceed a specific sum from year to year --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When the Congressional\nBudget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out\nwhether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do\nthey look at \"not to exceed,\" and do they take that\namount seriously? Or --\nMR. FREEMAN: Oh, oh, absolutely,\nYour Honor. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the\nposition of the Respondents is that it makes no\ndifference.\nMR. FREEMAN: No difference at all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So Congress is saying nothing\nat all.\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It really --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the consequence\non the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this\nmoney, and I figure out that this is going to cost me\n$80,000 --\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I sign a contract\nand say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I\nknow there isn't going to be $100,000. There's only\ngoing to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right?\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, in fact, it can't work\nthat way, Your Honor, because the amounts are limited by\nstatute to the reasonable and allowable costs that are\nnot duplicative of the principal program funds, the\nfunds to run the program --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but it's --\nwell, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that\nis to ask for 100?\nMR. FREEMAN: Right. And if a tribe thinks\nthat we haven't put in to the -- we haven't offered them\nenough money for their contract support costs, they are\nallowed to decline the offer that we make. And they\ncan -- unusually, for government contractors, they can\nfile a separate lawsuit before entering into the\ncontract to litigate whether the terms are sufficient.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freeman, where did\nthese caps come from? Did the agency initiate them?\nOr, there's a chart -- perhaps I don't understand it\ncorrectly. It's on page 210 of the joint appendix. It\ndoes -- it does seem to indicate that it was the BIA\nthat proposed the cutback.\nMR. FREEMAN: The caps come from Congress,\nYour Honor. Respondents have make -- have made an\nargument at the end of their brief that the government\nshould be liable here notwithstanding the caps because\nthe BIA hasn't requested sufficient funding from\nCongress -- or, rather, the President hasn't requested\nsufficient funding from Congress.\nThat argument, we think, is baseless for a\nnumber of reasons. And just as a factual matter, the\nGAO has done some studies of this. There are reports in\nthe joint appendix explaining why BIA has not in every\nyear asked for what turned out to be enough money.\nAnd that's because these -- this funding is\ndone on a prospective estimated basis. And because\nwe're required to take into -- we are required to accept\nevery contract that comes in the door, BIA may estimate\nand make its best available estimate, and OMB and the\nPresident may accept that if he chooses, but it still\nmay turn out not to be enough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not really relevant\nhere anyway, is it?\nMR. FREEMAN: No, it is not. It is not\nrelevant, Your Honor. No. That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't understand is\nwhy the language \"not to exceed\" is any different from\nCongress appropriating $900,000. You mean the world\nchanges if -- if Congress, instead of just appropriating\n$900,000, authorizes the Secretary to expend not to\nexceed $900,000? Why --\nMR. FREEMAN: I don't think in that\ncircumstance there would be any difference. Here, the\nreason why it's different is that this is ultimately a\nquestion of what Congress was trying to do. There's no\nconstitutional argument that Congress can't enact these\nkind of caps, and we know from the \"not to exceed\"\nlanguage that Congress was being as emphatic as it\ncould.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I would think\n$900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you\nappropriate.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right. And just -- it's just\nthis is the way, as an ordinary matter, that in\nappropriations Congress expresses an internal cap. It\nsaid --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that runs you right into\nFerris. Then you're saying that there's no difference\nbetween the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is\njust an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation,\nwhich is up to or not to exceed that amount of money.\nMR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, Ferris we think is\ninapplicable just to this type of statutory scheme where\nwe're required to enter into the contracts, and there's\na limited sum available. That's Judge Dyk's reasoning\nin the Federal Circuit. But let me put that aside for\nthe moment and address Ferris directly.\nAs I said before, Ferris is about the\ncircumstance in which there are enough available funds\nin the first instance to pay the contractual\nobligations.\nNow, Ferris does not and cannot stand for\nthe proposition that an executive officer, looking at\nthe amount Congress made available in the first\ninstance, can bind the Treasury to pay more than\nCongress has expressly stated he may bind it to. This\nCourt has said many, many times --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it the Respondents'\nposition is that the contracting officer says, now, this\nis going to go over the not to exceed amount, but not to\nworry, just sue us under the Judgment -- just sue us\nunder the Judgment Act.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right. And there is no reason\nto think that Congress contemplated such a scheme, which\nwould amount to essentially giving full contract support\ncost funding, but only for the tribes who have the\nresources and sophistication to sue, minus litigation\ncosts. That makes no sense at all. When Congress says\n\"not to exceed,\" a certain amount of money may come out\nof the Treasury --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It makes sense if\nyou're looking at the reality of the budgeting process\nbecause in one case, that line item appears on the\nDepartment of Interior budget; and in the other case, it\nappears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget. And\nthey can say it's not our fault. The Judgment Fund --\nthe Court made us do it --\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, I don't think so,\nYour Honor. The Judgment Fund is not a new thing. The\nJudgment Fund is available only to pay judgments validly\nentered against the United States.\nNow, we don't dispute that it's available to\npay breach of contract damages. But of course, a breach\nof contract requires a violation of -- a violation, a\nfailure to perform a binding contractual promise.\nNow, we think we've performed our promise\nhere because our -- our promise was to pay the sums that\nCongress made lawfully available. And we think that, to\nthe extent Respondents think we promised to pay more\nthan Congress explicitly said could be available, the\nSecretary had no authority to enter into that promise.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's true of every\ncontract. That's where I'm getting stuck on what your\ntheory is. The Antideficiency Act says you can't spend\nmore than you're given.\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So every single\ncontractor, under your logic, should know that when they\nsign a contract, the government can break it because if\nit doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay.\nMR. FREEMAN: And, Your Honor, that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- so there's no\nreal logic to your argument, other than to say we\ncan't -- we're -- if the contract says \"subject to\nappropriations,\" let's do away with Ferris, let's do\naway with Cherokee Nation, and --\nMR. FREEMAN: No, no --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- it just means that we\npay you what we can.\nMR. FREEMAN: No. That -- that is\nemphatically not true. As -- as an initial matter, as\nI've tried to explain before, there are very strict\nrequirements in the government's contracting processes,\nsuch as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that limit\nthe ability of the government to make promises it\ncan't keep, particularly with regard to funding.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you're saying\nis you make two promises on the ISDA. We're going to\npay you your support costs, your administrative costs,\nin full, and we're going to retain the right to break\nthat promise. That's really what you're saying the ISDA\nsays.\nMR. FREEMAN: No. That's not right,\nYour Honor. And I -- I'll answer this, and then I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nThe ISDA says our promise is to pay you what\nCongress lets us pay you. It's not breaking our promise\nto limit it to appropriation. It is keeping our\npromise.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you ignore all the\nlanguage where it says we're going to pay you X amount,\nall the law that says you have to be reimbursed -- the\ntribes have to be reimbursed for all their costs.\nAll of that is going to be ignored.\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, it's not that it's\nignored, it's that section 450j-1(b) says,\n\"notwithstanding any other provision of this Act,\" and\nwe think that's fairly clear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI guess I'd like to start on the Ferris\ndoctrine, because it seems to me that is the fundamental\nissue in this case.\nAnd the principle of Ferris -- and it's\ninteresting to me that counsel for the government never\nonce makes any reference to the Comptroller General's\ninterpretation of the Ferris doctrine, which in the\nRedbook says, as plain as day, that in circumstances\nlike this one, where the government has more contractors\nthan it had -- than one, and those contractors are\nsubject to an appropriation, and it cannot exceed that\nappropriation -- I think all of that language, frankly,\nis implied anyway -- the contract --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think now -- you\nsay you don't want us to mention \"not to exceed\" in our\nopinion --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. This --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- other than to say that\nit's irrelevant?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. \"Not to exceed\" has a\nvery significant role to play, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Redbook talk\nabout \"not to exceed\" as being any different from\ngeneral appropriations?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The place where \"not to\nexceed,\" I think, carries particular significance is\nthat in the ordinary situation, we would be entitled to\nseek injunctive relief to take money from other sources\nwithin -- within the budget and get an injunction. And\nthat's very unique to the -- to this context.\nOrdinarily, government contractors cannot seek\ninjunctive relief. This \"not to exceed\" language --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Redbook --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- deprives us of that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Redbook refer to\n\"not to exceed\" -- the \"not to exceed\" language?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Redbook have --\nrefer to the \"not to exceed\" language?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The Redbook doesn't -- well,\nactually, the Redbook does say that all of these phrases\nare essentially the same, which is that they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I saw -- I read the\nRedbook. I might have missed the part that you're about\nto cite to, because I'd like you to tell me where in the\nRedbook it says that a contractor who has a contract\nthat says \"subject to appropriations\" and is then\ndealing with the law of Congress which says the\nappropriation will not exceed X million is then entitled\nto be paid on a contract where he and like contracts do\nexceed X million. Where does it say that in the\nRedbook?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The Redbook --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I couldn't find it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the Redbook talks about\nsubject to appropriations. It talks about up through --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I did read it. I just\nwould like to know what page you want me to read again.\nI read the Chamber of Commerce brief. The\nChamber of Commerce brief says everybody knows that the\ncontractors are paid in this situation. So I looked up\nthe authorities that they cited. Okay?\nI read the Redbook. I read my other case of\nCherokee. I read Ferris. I read Sutton. I can't say\nI'm perfect at reading --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but I couldn't find it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I would appreciate your\nreferring me to those citations.\nMR. PHILLIPS: 2 GAO Redbook 6-44 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have it in front of me,\nby coincidence.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here it is.\nMR. PHILLIPS: This is -- this is in our\nbrief at page --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I have\nthe Redbook 6-44.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What page, for those\nof us who don't have it in front of us?\nMR. PHILLIPS: In my brief, it's on page 31.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying it isn't\nthere. I just read through these pretty quickly. I\njust need a little refresher.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. If you look at -- I'm\nsorry -- 2 GAO -- well, I think you can use either of\nthese: 2 GAO Redbook 6-28 to -29 talks --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I don't have that one.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- talks about \"for\" followed\nby a purpose and an amount has the, quote, \"same effect\nas\" -- quote -- \"words like 'not more than' or 'not to\nexceed.'\"\nSo, I mean, what they're saying is that\nall of this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you give me that\ncite again?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry. I apologize, Your\nHonor.\n2 GAO Redbook 6-28 to -29. And I think the\nsame --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. That isn't quite my\nquestion. My question was: I would like the authority\nfor the proposition that when you have a set of\ncontractors, and they read their contract, and it says\n\"subject to appropriation,\" and then you read the law,\nand it says they will not be paid, it shall not exceed\n$4 million, and then you discover that the amount of the\ncontracts of the same kind in this category are more\nthan $4 million, I want to know where in the Redbook it\nsays that they get paid more than $4 million.\nThat's all. That's fairly simple.\nAnd if that's -- if that's normal practice,\nit must be there's a lot of authority for it. So I -- I\njust want to know what to read.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, here, 6-45 says, \"if a\ncontract is but one activity under a larger\nappropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the\ncontractor to know how much of that\nappropriation remains available.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they aren't talking\nabout there where it says specifically in the contract\n\"subject to appropriations.\" At least I think they're\nnot.\nNow, I would like you right now to tell me,\nno, you're wrong; it does say that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it says, if Congress\nappropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular\ncontract --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're distinguishing\nSutton from Ferris.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to use that\nto distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with,\nwell, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is\nBrandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a\nline appropriation. And I thought that just refers to\nthe fact that because there's a line appropriation, the\ncontractor's on notice.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly.\nAnd when you do business with the government\nover a period of years, and it says \"subject to\nappropriation,\" not necessarily you but your lawyer,\nwho's a good lawyer, should look up and see what the\nappropriation is or whether it was made. And that's\nwhat I gather --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, as a matter\nof policy -- you know, if Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not as a matter of\npolicy. I'm putting it as a question because that was\nmy first reaction. And I expect you to say, no, Justice\nBreyer --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, clearly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you're wrong, and that\nisn't the practice, and here is what I read to show that\nisn't the practice. That's all I'm asking.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I guess I don't\nunderstand exactly how to answer that question, Justice\nBreyer, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: By showing me where in the\nlaw it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question\nfor the third time, but it says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would. I've\nlost the question.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here sometimes not\neveryone pays sufficient attention to these very clear\nquestions.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm doing my best,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where -- look,\nhypothetical. Four people, four identical contracts,\nthe words appear, \"subject to appropriation.\"\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Each is for a million\ndollars.\nThen you read the appropriation that was\nlater made, and in that statute, it says, we hereby\nappropriate $3 million, and -- it is, the payments are\nnot to exceed $3 million.\nOkay? Something like that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All I want is the authority\nthat says each of those four people can come in and get\nthe $1 million, totaling $4 million. I want the\nauthority that says that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, I would read Ferris\nas if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Ferris -- it did not say\nanything about it in the contract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, Ferris has a\nlimitation. The -- the government has already told us\nthat \"subject to appropriation\" is implicit in every --\nin every agreement anyway, so there's nothing special\nabout putting in the words \"subject to appropriation.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, there certainly is.\nPutting in the words gives the lawyer notice.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, the only notice\nit gives is that there has to be enough money when you\nlook at the appropriation to cover your contract.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ferris did not say, as I\nrecall, that you can't expect the contractor to have\nnotice that appropriations have been limited. It said\nyou can't expect them to have notice as to how much of\nthe expenditures under that appropriated act have been\nspent. Isn't that the only thing it required notice of?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think, if you sign\na contract, you better be sure that there are\nappropriations for it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Clearly. And that -- I mean,\nand, Justice Breyer, the Court's opinion in Cherokee\nsaid that the primary purpose of the subject to\navailability clause is to deal with the situation where\nyou enter into the agreement ahead of the fiscal year,\nand so everybody knows that if Congress, for whatever\nreason, decides not to appropriate any money, there's no\ndeal, and nothing happens.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in your view, if the\ntribe comes to the government, and they say, look, we've\nbeen looking at what you've done with the other tribes,\nyou've appropriated $95 million, and the appropriation\nsays \"not to exceed $95 million,\" but go ahead and make\nthis contract with us anyway, no one cares. And you\nsay, go ahead and make it. Right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, it seems to me\nit's the government's problem to sort out.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's your -- that's your\nposition, isn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But, again, put it in\nthe context, Justice Kennedy, of the individual tribe.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You can't get it from\nCherokee. I mean, yes, there's Ferris, and then\nCherokee --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is relying on Ferris.\nBut Cherokee was very careful to point out that there\nwere funds to cover the cost --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No question about it, Justice\nGinsburg. I don't think this case is controlled by\nCherokee.\nI do think Cherokee answers the question of\nhow far can you carry the \"subject to availability\"\nlanguage. I don't think it gets the government anywhere\nnear home.\nAnd then the question is, what do you do\nwith the \"not to exceed\" language. And what I would suggest\nthere is that, that's no different, frankly, from Ferris\nor any other situation, because what the -- Congress\noperates against the backdrop of Ferris, which is a\n120-plus-year-old doctrine that has been allowed to stay\nin place by Congress for that entire time. And as the\nChamber of Commerce tells us, this is a rule that every\ncontractor takes as an article of faith in dealing with\nthe United States Government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, am I correct that\nwhat the government is arguing is that the fact that\nthis limitation was included in the particular contract\nmakes it different from Ferris?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's hard to make that\nargument because the -- the \"not to exceed\" language, at\nleast, that comes out of the -- that's in the\nappropriations provision. That's not in the contract\nitself. The contract itself simply says \"subject to\nappropriations.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which Ferris did not. Did\nthe Ferris contract say that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's -- Ferris doesn't have\nthe \"subject to appropriation,\" but the Ferris contract\nsays the appropriation limit is X.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does? Where do you\nget -- I couldn't find the contract. The language in\nFerris is, \"a contractor who is one of several persons\nto be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable\nwith knowledge of its administration.\" True.\nNow, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one\ndifference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the\ncontract, saying you're subject to appropriation to\nget to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge.\nAnd the second thing in Ferris is that it\nwas an individual who went off on his own in the\nadministration and paid money that he shouldn't have\npaid. It should have been over here for the contract.\nIn this case, it is an instance where\nCongress itself required the money to be paid, as it was\npaid, and didn't provide enough. Okay.\nSo that's where I am with Ferris, which is a\nbig question mark. And I guess you could talk about\nthat, but all I wanted to know is what is well\nestablished in this field.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to write\nsomething that suddenly upsets what is well established.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Okay. Well, I take this,\nthen, straight from the Redbook again. \"It is settled\nthat contractors paid from a general appropriation are\nnot barred from recovering for breach of contract, even\nthough the appropriation is exhausted.\"\nAnd so even though -- and there's\nnothing in -- there's no limitation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that is that as it\nsays in the contract, you are barred, you are barred\nfrom recovering if we don't appropriate enough money.\nShould it say that wouldn't matter? Is that right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it would say that if\nyou don't appropriate enough money for the specific\ncontract, yes. I think that's clearly what Sutton\nholds. Is that if -- if Justice Scalia and I have an\nagreement, and the -- the appropriation goes to $100 for\nour agreement, and the contract says $500, I'm out of\nluck for the extra $400.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, this is an\nunusual situation with the tribes, because in the normal\nnot to exceed appropriation by Congress, the government\nrightly says we have the power to not contract. And in\nmilitary contracts and others, we have a for convenience\ncancellation. We have all sorts of things that protect\nus from the deficiency.\nBut this is a unique situation because the\ngovernment, on the one hand, despite their protestations\nto the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And on the other hand,\nCongress is saying, don't pay more on them. We're\ntelling you to accept more payment than we're going to\ngive you.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Should we create a\nspecial rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a\nspecial rule for this unique situation?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because essentially what\nyou're doing is putting the backs of this problem --\nputting the burden of this problem on the backs of -- of\ninnocent contractors who --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Who entered into in good\nfaith these agreements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is it just a\nquestion of our creating a new rule, or rather, is the\nproposition whether the tribes, when they entered into\nthis, should have realized that because of the\npeculiarity of these contracts that they had to be\nentered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply\ndoes not apply? It ought to be a question of\nexpectation of the tribe, should it not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would -- I would\nsuggest a couple things about that. I mean, I think in\ngeneral it's reasonable to look for the -- obviously,\nthe intent of the parties and the expectations of the\nparties.\nThis case went off on summary judgment that\nwe lost. I mean, even on a -- so we didn't have an\nopportunity for any analysis of this. So the reality\nis, is that from the tribe's perspective, they\nrecognize, because of Ferris, and because of the way the\nComptroller General has interpreted Ferris, that they\nare under a duty to make sure that there is an\nappropriation that covers this contract, that the\namount, purpose, time requirements are all satisfied\nwith enough money to accomplish that.\nAnd then, of course, we have the obligation\nto perform, which, of course, that's the other half of\nthe equation here.\nAnd, Justice Sotomayor, that's why I\nwouldn't say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't -- you\ndon't have the obligation to perform. I mean -- right?\nIn a term of the contract, that their lack of\nsufficient appropriations, performance by either party\nis excused.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that -- yes,\nJustice Ginsburg. But the problem is, we don't know the\nanswer to that until after the year of performance is\ndone, or at least months into the performance. And\nsometimes, literally after we've already performed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you did know.\nSuppose the tribe knew that the 95 million -- let's\nassume that that's the not to exceed amount -- had\nalready been obligated. Could the tribe then go ahead\nand make the government -- a contract with the\ngovernment, and would the government have to make that\ncontract, in your view?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, that -- that is the\nSouthern Ute case. And I -- and certainly, you can make\nan argument to that. The government has an argument on\nthe other side.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your argument that\nthe answer to that is yes?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The argument is, it appears\nthat Congress intended to require them to enter into\nthat agreement. You know, the idea of Congress\nrequiring the -- an official to enter into an agreement\nthat violates a criminal statute is at least a -- a\ndifficult concept to sort of wrap your mind around.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't this more specific\nlanguage than the general language? Doesn't this\nspecific language, \"not to exceed,\" supersede the\ngeneral obligation to make the contract? Otherwise,\nit's meaningless. The \"not to exceed language\" is\nmeaningless.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say it's meaningless.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Kennedy. I told\nyou what the meaning of the \"not to exceed\" language is.\nThe \"not to exceed\" language ensures that we\ncannot turn to the BIA or anyone else at the Interior\nand say, give us money from another source in order to\npay for our contract. And we can't use the injunctive\nrelief that's otherwise available to us for that\npurpose.\nSo that language has very significant\nimportance in limiting what our options are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- in a circumstance where we\nare not being paid enough under the -- the agreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- do I understand your\nposition to be that, yes, the cap has meaning, because\nin order to exceed the cap, the tribe has to sue? So,\nany tribe that sues, for any tribe that sues, the cap is\nmeaningless? It's only for the ones who are not\nsophisticated enough to sue. They're just stuck with\nwhat Congress said.\nSo it seems to me that would be a very\nbizarre scheme to set up that, that you have a cap, but the\ncap is meaningless if you bring a lawsuit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I -- I mean, I -- it\nseems to me that we can't -- I mean, aside from bringing\na lawsuit, I mean, we -- we could go to the Secretary\nand say, we don't have enough money to satisfy our\ncontract, would you take money from some other source in\norder to accomplish that.\nBecause, in the ordinary course, that's not\nuncommon to re -- re-jigger the -- the appropriation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it protects\nthese -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know\nenough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that -- yes, there\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that make their\nsituation better somehow?\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, that would not\nmake our situation any better, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is whether\nthe cap was meaningless. And I think your answer is,\nyes, for anyone who sues, the cap is meaningless.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. No. It -- I don't -- I\ndon't think it does that. It -- it places inherent\nlimitations -- I mean, it says specifically that the\nSecretary is not authorized to shift money around in\norder to take care of this particular problem in this\nparticular year that otherwise would be available to us.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You just go to the\nJudgment Fund --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE PHILLIPS: You just go to the\nJudgment Fund --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course. Then, we --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which makes it\nmeaningless.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, ultimately, it means\nthat the burden of it will not fall on the tribes. It\nis -- it does mean that.\nBut -- and let's be clear about this. The\nJudgment Fund -- this is not simply going to the\nJudgment Fund and asking for our contract support costs\nto be paid. Our argument here is that there has been a\nbreach of contract, and we're entitled to the damages\nfor the breach of contract, whether those are reliance\ndamages or restitutionary damages, whether we -- whether\nwe're supposed to get what we expected out of the deal,\nor put back in the position we would have been in --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, if you look at\nthis situation, it seems pretty clear that Congress did\nwant to do something, which was to limit the amount of\nmoney that was going to the tribes under these\ncontracts.\nDo you think that there's a way that\nCongress can do that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- consistent with this\nscheme that's set up by the statute?\nHow could Congress do that? You know, if --\nif -- if they can't do it this way, how could they?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the easy way would be\nto impose specific limitations in -- in every one of the\ncontracts, which -- which, frankly, if you read\nappropriations bills, which I hate to say I have\noccasionally done --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: When you say \"specific\nlimitations,\" what would that look like?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It would look like -- for the\nagreement between the United States and Ramah Navajo\nfor -- for contract support costs in this\nparticular -- for taking over the police department, the\ncontract support costs shall not exceed $150,000,\nperiod. That's the total appropriation.\nAnd if we look at our contract -- and\nthere's a specific number in the contract -- and that\ncontract number says $174,000, then we know that we're\nout of luck for the $24,000. We've been put on specific\nnotice --\nJUSTICE ALITO: For any particular year, are\nthey all entered into it at about the same time?\nMR. PHILLIPS: What's that, Justice Alito?\nJUSTICE ALITO: For any particular fiscal\nyear, are all of these contracts entered into by a\nparticular date?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Nothing is all that\neasy, obviously. Some of them enter into it on a fiscal\nyear basis. Some of them enter into it on a -- on\na -- on a calendar year basis.\nAnd, frankly, the -- part of the problem is\nwhen does the government get around to signing these\nagreements.\nAnd, also, there are 12 regions. I mean,\npart of the reason -- I would like to spend a second\ntalking about the comment that, you know, we have this\nfair and equitable scheme in place in which we're\nallocating moneys out, when the reality is, is that\nthere is substantial evidence in the record, even though\nwe have not had an opportunity to make a full record,\nthat the -- that the -- that the Bureau makes mistakes\nin 40 percent of these contractual arrangements.\nAnd I know my -- my colleague's going to\ndispute that, but the truth is we've known that for\nyears. They just make mistakes, and people get\nimpaired -- their contract rights are impaired on that\nbasis.\nThis is not some kind of an equitable scheme\nthat's operating here. There are 12 different regions\noperating in 12 different ways. Some people get money,\nsome people get 300 percent of theirs, some people get\n0 percent of theirs.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, how does\nCongress do this without upsetting the entire\nscheme? Knowing that these contracts are not all signed\non one day, that there are 12 regions, that the\nnegotiations go over time, how could Congress achieve\nthe scheme that the government wants now? How would it\nwrite this contract?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the easy way\nwould be to take away the requirement that the\ngovernment has to enter into all of these contracts at\nthe request of the tribe. And -- and -- and that's\nclearly available. If they want to go down that path,\nthey can do that in a heartbeat. And then they have all\nof the discretion they want -- they want to apply under\nthese circumstances.\nSo, I mean, there's -- obviously, there is a\nbit of, as we said in the brief, schizophrenia. And I\nhave -- I have some misgivings about describing Congress\nthat way, but there is some schizophrenia in how they\napproach this problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have to solve it\ncontract by contract? Couldn't there be a -- a\nprovision in the -- in the law which -- which says that,\nwhere appropriated funds are inadequate to cover the\ntotality of -- of costs under this statute, it will be\napportioned as follows?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Congress could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or the Secretary will\napportion it? That's all it would take. You wouldn't\neven have to do it contract by contract. Right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I -- I mean, I think\nthat would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would prefer contract\nby contract for your clients.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I just think it's been\nnoted --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, absolutely --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- but, you know, I don't\ndisagree with that.\nLook, and as we argued in our brief, there\nare three or four different ways that Congress can fix\nthis problem going forward. But -- and that's -- and\nthat's the message, I thought, from Justice Sotomayor,\nis why don't we let Congress fix the problem and allow\nthe background principles of Ferris, as interpreted by\nthe Comptroller General, to apply in this case in order\nto resolve the contract dispute that's properly,\nobviously, before the Court at this point.\nI'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- I think\nthis may have been asked, and I'm not sure of the -- I\nunderstood the answer.\nThis is -- is this on an ongoing,\nforward-looking basis? In other words, you enter into\nthe contracts, and then you wait and see whether there\nare appropriations?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Typically what happens\nis you enter into the agreement sometime just before the\nappropriation comes down. It's -- it's usually pretty\nclose, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so doesn't it\nmake -- I mean, doesn't the system that the government\nis operating under make a lot of sense? Because let's\nsay the tribe says, look, we need a million dollars.\nThe Secretary agrees to it. And then I assume the two\nof them get together and say, well, we'll try to get the\nappropriation for it. You know, you understand we may\nnot get it, but this is how much you need, we'll go back\nand get it. If you get it, that's great. If you don't,\nwell, then that's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And again -- and, Mr. Chief\nJustice, if they did that on a -- on a tribe-by-tribe,\ncontract-by-contract basis, I -- I wouldn't have any\nproblem with that, because then you're on notice.\nBut when they say to you, okay, fine,\nhere's -- you know, this is -- here is your contract\nsupport cost provision, there's a specific number in\nthere, 1.3.78 dollars and 63 cents, that's what you\nought to get, and we get an appropriation that comes\nback in that says the government will -- that, you know,\nwe have appropriated $100 million for contract support\ncosts.\nThere are 330 other tribes out there\npotentially with contracts that are involved here. It\nis -- and -- and just to put it in context, we are\ntalking about -- you know, many of these tribes are in\nincredibly remote situations. They don't have access to\nall the other information about what's going on. And\nthe real question is, should you impose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you\nsuggesting that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that on the tribes?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you suggesting\nthat Congress has to go through each of those contracts\nand say, this is how much we're going to appropriate,\nthis is how much -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that's -- I actually\nthink that would be the fairer way to do it. And I\ndon't think it would be as burdensome as -- as your\nquestion implies, because, again, what else does staff\nhave better to do than to sit down and put all those\nappropriations together?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the question\nis whether it's the staff in Congress that's going to do\nit or the staff at the Department of the Interior?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose\nCongress can reasonably determine that the people at\nInterior know better about how to do it than we do.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But then -- then they\ncould do it by -- by -- expressly by reference.\nI mean, if, in fact, Interior has set it out\nthat way and has it all done, then they can just\nincorporate it into the statute anyway.\nI mean, there are simple ways to do it.\nThere are broader ways to do it. And as I said to\nJustice Sotomayor, clearly Congress could simply, you\nknow, absolve the government of its responsibility to\nenter into any contract that a -- that a -- when an\nIndian tribe shows up at their doorstep.\nAll of those seem to me preferable than\nsaying to the tribes, after they have fully performed\ntheir side of the deal, okay, I'm sorry, we're not going\nto pay you.\nThe -- the other thing that's odd about\nthis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You keep\nsaying that, but I thought in your earlier answer, you\nsaid that the contracts are generally signed by the time\nof the appropriation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is that in the\ncycle of performance? Is that at the beginning of\nperformance?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's at the beginning of\nperformance. But -- but what we find out about the\nnotices that we are -- that we have later receive is at\nsome point, we're sending you 75 percent in some\nsituations, or we're going to send you exactly the same\namount of money you got last year, even though that\nwon't cover it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the tribes -- even\nwhen the appropriation comes out, they don't know how\nmuch the Department has contracted with other tribes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. We haven't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they're performing\nuntil they get that notice later on.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly. And, candidly,\nassume that -- either one of two things will happen.\nEither we will ultimately be paid in full, which has\nhappened -- I mean, the last year, they were in fact\npaid in full. Or alternatively, that they will have\naccess to the Judgment Fund in order to -- to get the\nrecovery they are otherwise entitled to.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, do you\nthink -- and the long question here is what did Congress\nwant. And what -- one answer might be Congress wanted\nexactly what the government says it wanted. But another\nanswer might be something different, that actually,\nCongress wanted there to be unlimited funds for these\ntribes, but that it wanted to shift the costs of some of\nthose funds to the Judgment Fund outside of the Interior\nbudget.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -- I mean, do you\ncontest the government's view of what Congress wanted\nhere? And if so, how?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the question is\nit's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case,\nand therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme\nin a way that is most favorable to the tribes. And if\nthat means that the scheme operates so as to protect the\nintegrity of the appropriations process and the spending\nprocess for a particular year, and prevents us from\nbeing able to seek relief outside of this contract\nsupport cost appropriation limitation, that makes\nperfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the\navailability of the Judgment Fund at the end of the day\nso that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full\nburden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as\nopposed to anyone else.\nI mean, that's -- again, we do\nprovide -- we've performed the services. We don't know.\nWe do it in good faith. Under those circumstances, it\nseems to me that's the classic situation in which we\nshould receive full compensation.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips.\nMr. Freeman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREEMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you dispute\nMr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how\nmuch they're getting until some point further into the\nperformance cycle?\nMR. FREEMAN: In part, Your Honor. Let me\nexplain. As I mentioned earlier, for the first many\nyears in this scheme, we did a uniform pro rata\ndistribution methodology. The tribes came to us and\nsaid, look, that's a problem for us because we don't\nhave any budget transparency; we can't see how much\nwe're going to get. So we adopted this policy in 2006.\nAnd one of the principal elements of that policy is that\nit guarantees that, if -- as long as Congress\nappropriates as much money as it did in the previous\nfiscal year, which it generally has, the tribe will get\nimmediately, like within 2 weeks, the exact amount of\nmoney that it received in the previous year. And that\nmoney comes immediately. They can use it however they\nwant. It's not subject to apportionment. Unlike most\nFederal agencies, we don't dole it out. They get it\nright away.\nNow, the question then becomes what to do\nwith any additional money that Congress has\nappropriated, and the policy provides for distribution\nof that money on what we call a bottoms-up basis. We\ngive it to the tribes that are the farthest away from\n100 percent of funding. That resolution was negotiated\nwith the tribes and, indeed, with some counsel for\nRespondents. It's, we think -- and I might be wrong\nabout this -- but we think that that's the solution that\nthe tribes want, if the caps have any effect. There\nare --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess what I don't\nunderstand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman,\nis exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes\nbecome. I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a\ncontract, and we've held that it's a contract, and\nusually contracting parties have rights to something.\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So what do they have a right\nto, in your view?\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, first of all, let's make\nclear -- let's make sure that we're not --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That was -- that was a\nstraightforward question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREEMAN: Well, they have a right, Your\nHonor, in the first instance to the principal promise\nthat's under any ISDA contract, which is we give the\namount of money that the Secretary would have provided\nfor the program funds, for operational --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, but what do they have a\nright to with respect to these additional overhead\ncosts?\nMR. FREEMAN: Contract support costs. They\nhave a right as a class to the distribution of every\ndollar that Congress appropriates, and for every\ncontractor --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What does each individual\ntribe have a right to?\nMR. FREEMAN: A proportionate share based on\nthe Secretary's policy for the distribution of these in\nlight of the caps. Let me --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So you think they do have a\nright to a pro rata share?\nMR. FREEMAN: We think that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, the\nSecretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have\nbeen doing a better job, so we'll give it to them; or\nthese tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them.\nYou think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata\nshare.\nMR. FREEMAN: We think there's a contractual\nright to -- and, in fact, the contracts often reference\nthese policies directly. For example, page 123 of the\njoint appendix, one of the contracts in this case says\nyou'll be paid according to the distribution policy as\nadopted by the Secretary. So in that case, yes, we\nbound ourselves --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I didn't\nthink that was responsive. Does the Secretary --\nJustice Kagan can defend her own question -- but does\nthe Secretary have the discretion to adopt something\nother than a pro rata distribution when there are not\nsufficient appropriations?\nMR. FREEMAN: We think within a range of\nreasonable solutions after consultation with the tribes,\nyes. We don't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You must answer that\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The system that's in\nplace does not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You must answer that\nquestion \"yes\" --\nMR. FREEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because that's exactly\nwhat the Secretary did.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- claimed that it\nwas pro rata.\nMR. FREEMAN: That's right. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then this is a\nvery -- this is a very strange kind of contractual\nright. The -- the contracting tribe has a right to have\nthe Secretary use discretion to decide how much the\ncontracting tribe gets.\nWhat kind of contract is that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREEMAN: Respectfully -- respectfully,\nYour Honor, that is an exaggeration. Congress has\nappropriated since 1994 more than $2.3 billion in\ncontract support cost funds. We've distributed all of\nthat money to the tribes. All of the tribes here have\ngotten substantial sums.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, I'm not contesting -- I\nmean, clearly you think and the Secretary thinks that\nthere's an obligation to distribute all that money.\nMR. FREEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and I don't think\nanybody disagrees with that. The question is what each\nindividual tribe has a contractual right to.\nMR. FREEMAN: May I answer the question,\nYour Honor?\nYour Honor, once it is clear that the caps\ncontrol the total amount of money that the Secretary may\nspend, every further question is a question of\nallocation. We think we have the policy that's right -\nit was negotiated with the tribes and counsel for\nRespondents -- but if we're wrong about that, we can\nhave that fight another day. The question here is\nwhether the caps define the maximum amount of money that\nthe Secretary may spend, and we think they do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
