        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 99-1823, Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission v. Waffle House, Inc.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent Waffle House and Eric Baker agreed to\narbitrate rather than litigate disputes between them.\nThat agreement precludes Waffle House and Baker from\nhaving an action take place between them in court. But\nthe EEOC was not a party to that agreement. Accordingly,\nthe agreement does not preclude the EEOC's ability to\nbring a public enforcement action against Waffle House,\nnor does it limit the remedies available to the EEOC in\nsuch an action.\nTitle VII gives the EEOC a public enforcement\naction that's independent of and, in many respects,\nsuperior to the individual employee's cause of action.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, suppose the individual\nemployee had settled with the employer, not just an\nagreement to arbitrate, but there had been a complete\nsettlement. They said, you know, in exchange for so much\nmoney, I waive any cause of action I had. Would the\nGovernment still has -- have a cause of action for\ndamages?\nMR. CLEMENT: We believe the Government would\nstill have a cause of action in that case, though we admit\nit would be a much more difficult case.\nQUESTION: Wow.\nMR. CLEMENT: Because in the case of settlement,\nof course, judicial or arbitral resources have already\nbeen expended. There's an agreement of the parties that\nspecifically extinguishes the individual's right --\nQUESTION: What are the damages? The Government\ngets damages that have already been paid to the individual\nto -- I don't understand. And these damages go to the\nindividual?\nMR. CLEMENT: The -- the damages could go to the\nindividual. I think, to give you an example of the kind\nof case --\nQUESTION: So, if he'd settle and get the\ndamages, and then -- and then he'd get additional damages\nrecovered for him by the EEOC.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right. But let me give you\nan example of the kind of case we have in mind, and it may\nhelp illustrate why the Government thinks it still may\nhave a cause of action in that situation.\nIf you can imagine a case where an employer has\nretaliated against an employee and -- simply for filing a\ncharge with the EEOC, and then that employee settles that\nretaliation claim for a nominal amount of money, without\nany judicial supervision, let's say, it may be that in\nthat kind of case, the EEOC has a legitimate public\ninterest in, nonetheless, bringing an action, getting some\nadditional amount of damages to really take the\nemployer --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's -- that's a separate\nwrong. I don't know if that's a really fair answer to\nJustice Scalia's question. If there's retaliation, I -- I\nwould think that's a separate component.\nBut just suppose a case with no retaliation.\nThe -- the employee recovers $10,000 and then the EEOC can\nrecover $20,000 more?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in a case like that, I'm\nsure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOC\nwould not bring that case.\nQUESTION: Well, let's say the prosecutor\ndoesn't exercise his discretion that way that day.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in that case I think they\nwould have cause of action.\nBut again, I want to make clear that we think\nthat's --\nQUESTION: And what -- and what happens --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- a much more difficult case.\nQUESTION: What would happen -- what would\nhappen if the employee recovered $10,000 in the\narbitration, then only $5,000 in the litigation? Does he\nhave to give $5,000 back?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think that would follow.\nBut again, I want to make clear that's a much\nmore difficult case because there there's been --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but we're asking what\nthe -- what the logical consequences of -- of your\nposition are, and that's why we're putting the more\ndifficult case so we can test the general proposition.\nAnd the general proposition, it seems to me, has to\nwithstand some analysis under these more difficult\ninstances.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, let me do -- let me make two\nresponses. One, let me try one more time to defend the\ngeneral principle, which is simply that Congress in Title\nVII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the\nextinguishment of the individual employee's cause of\naction shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause\nof action.\nBut let me hone in on why I think that's so much\nmore of a difficult case because in that case, the\nindividuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to\ndamages in an arbitration proceeding. And so, it might\nmake some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to\ndamages in a litigation proceeding.\nWhat is so anomalous about the decision below\nand the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it\nseeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific\nremedies in court even though those victim-specific\nremedies are available to the employee in the arbitration.\nAll of the cases that respondent cites --\nQUESTION: Well, here we have a case where the\nemployee did not settle, but we were really discussing\nwith you the possibility not presented in this case of a\nfull settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of\nthe victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should\nEEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-\nspecific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to\naddress the overall problem.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I guess I do think there are\ntwo reasons why they would still have a cause of action in\nthat situation. One is that Title VII does give the EEOC\nan independent cause of action. It's quite a remarkable\nstatute in that respect. It's unlike statutes this Court\nhas analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case\nwhere it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the\nrare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of\naction to the individual.\nThe second reason, though, is that generally, as\na matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason\nthat you hold one party in --in -- to a judgment that they\ndidn't participate in to the consequences of that is\nbecause the party in the first action adequately\nrepresented the interests of the party that wasn't\npresent. I --\nQUESTION: Well, why did the EEOC decide to get\ninto this case? Is there some sort of a pattern or\npractice involved that goes beyond this individual\nestablishment?\nMR. CLEMENT: My understanding is that the EEOC\npicked this case because this case -- the events here took\nplace in 1994. So, the ADA was still quite new at the\ntime that this -- that this case took place, and I think\nthe EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of\nwhat their obligations under the ADA were. So, they\npicked this case to litigate to help establish what\nemployers' obligations were under the EEOC --\nQUESTION: This is -- this is not any broad\npattern or practice. This is simply honing in on an\nindividual case?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's fair enough. But again,\nCongress has specifically allowed the EEOC to use its\nmodest litigation resources to vindicate the public\ninterest both in pattern and practice cases or cases that\nseek injunctive relief and victim-specific cases where\nthere's some aspect of the case that helps illustrate an\nimportant principle of law.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, may I ask you to back up\non how we would get to the point of having a settlement\nafter -- or an arbitral determination? I thought when the\nEEOC sues, then the individual has no right to come to\ncourt, that EEOC would be the exclusive litigator. And\nso, I think it's clear that the -- the individual employee\ncouldn't bring a suit, a rival suit, in -- in court.\nDoesn't that extend to arbitration as well? I\nthought that the -- giving the primacy to the EEOC meant\nit would control this entire claim in all of its aspects,\nbut you answered the question as though, even though the\nEEOC had filed, the employee could go on on a separate\ntrack.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I had taken the import of\nthe hypothetical as being that the individual had already\nsued and settled and then, only after that had taken\nplace, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative\naction.\nBut your question certainly highlights the\nanomaly of having this predispute arbitration agreement --\nQUESTION: Can the individual bring a suit? I\nmean, is the -- within the 180 days, doesn't EEOC have\ntotal control?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's absolutely right. The\nstatute gives the EEOC the exclusive right to initiate a\ncause of action for the first 180 days and then, for an\nextended period, until a right to sue letter issues.\nAnd that's why in light of the -- the\ncongressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only\na different action, but one that took primacy, that they\nhad the right to initiate the action once they found that\nthere was a determination that the suit would serve the\npublic interest, it seems particularly --\nQUESTION: Once they -- once they do initiate\nthe action, though, the individual cannot also bring an\naction. Right? So, what you're saying is that the --\nthat the EEOC suit is independent of the individuals, but\nsomehow the individual suit is not independent of the\nEEOC's.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, allow -- allow me to make\ntwo responses. One is it's clear that under the ADA and\nTitle VII, it's not that the EEOC's filing of a suit\nsimply extinguishes the individual's cause of action\nentirely. They -- the individual has a absolute right to\nintervene in the EEOC's action. So, if those actions were\n100 percent duplicative, there would be no need to allow\nthe individual to intervene in the suit.\nQUESTION: Exactly. I -- I don't know why you\nthink that cuts in your favor rather than against you. It\nseems to me the whole structure of the thing indicates\nthat there's one cause of action. It can be brought by\nthe EEC or by the individual, but not by both.\nMR. CLEMENT: I mean --\nQUESTION: Not by both successfully, anyway.\nMR. CLEMENT: I respectfully disagree because,\nunlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the\nexclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or\nany basis to get into court for the individual. They can\nstill intervene in the EEOC's action.\nQUESTION: So, you're saying that if the EEOC\nbrings an action in circumstances such as this, an\nindividual who has agreed to arbitrate the claim can\nintervene and not be bound? The individual is not bound\nby the arbitration agreement?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, we do not take that position.\nTo the contrary, we think that the arbitration agreement\ndoes preclude in this case Mr. Baker from intervening in\nthe EEOC's action. And I think that's quite a persuasive\nanswer to the argument that the other side has made that\nsomehow allowing the EEOC to sue in these circumstances\nrenders the arbitration agreement a dead letter. It\ndoesn't.\nQUESTION: It's a very strange use of the\nArticle III courts to have litigation proceeding in which\none of the real parties in interest is not permitted to\nintervene. That --\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that strikes me as a -- a\ndistortion of the whole case in controversy rule.\nMR. CLEMENT: It may be, but I think that is the\nconsequence of the arbitration agreement and the\nimplication of the FAA.\nQUESTION: Well, if it is a distortion of the\ncase in controversy rule, then we're in real trouble,\naren't we?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, even if you disagree with me\non -- on that particular point and you say that the FAA\ndoes not prevent Baker from intervening on this action,\nit's still true that the arbitration agreement is -- has a\nmeaningful benefit to Waffle House because before Waffle\nHouse entered that arbitration agreement with Baker, it\nwas subject to a suit in court by either the EEOC or\nBaker. The agreement with Baker limited Baker to an\narbitral forum. But absent a similar agreement with the\nEEOC, Waffle House has simply no expectation and no basis\nto keep the EEOC out of court or to limit its remedies in\ncourt.\nQUESTION: Do you think it is -- do you think it\nis going to be very comfort to Waffle House to know that,\nyes, it can't be sued in court by the individual, but the\nentire prosecutorial power of the United States can be\nbrought to bear on it in -- in a suit in court? What\nWaffle House wants to do is to stay out of court, and\nthat's what they're getting at when they talk about\nundercutting the -- the -- in effect, the arbitration\nagreement.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, if Waffle\nHouse wants to stay out of court, then it needs to reach\nan agreement with every party that has a statutory right\nto get them into court. And as a practical matter, I\nstill think --\nQUESTION: Unless one statutory right is\nderivative of the other. I mean, that's the -- that's the\nwhole issue in the case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes, and we think there are\ngood --\nQUESTION: And you -- you keep saying the\nGovernment has an independent right to sue, but you know,\nthat begs the question. That -- that's the whole issue.\nIt is given a right to sue, but is -- is that right to sue\nderivative of the individual's right so that it disappears\nwhen the individual's does?\nMR. CLEMENT: And I do not think it is. And\nit's -- and I think in fact the text of Title VII is quite\nclear.\nQUESTION: Then I think your answer has got to\nbe that the settlement clearly does not bind the\nGovernment.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, and that's\n-- that's a well-established principle. I mean, look at\n-- look at Firefighters Local No. 93 against -- against\nthe City of Cleveland. The Court says it's a fundamental\nprinciple that a settlement cannot bind non-parties to the\nlitigation.\nQUESTION: How does this compare with the Fair\nLabor Standards Act where the Secretary of Labor could sue\nor the individual could sue, say, for a wage and hour\nviolation? Or let's take a violation of the Equal Pay\nAct. How -- how does that work when the Secretary brings\na suit?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think in all of those cases, the\nstatutory scheme works effectively the same. There are\nindependent causes of action given to the Government\nentity and to the individual. And this Court held in the\nTony and Susan Alamo Foundation case that just because the\nindividual forswears a cause of action or right to sue\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act, that does not preclude\nthe Secretary of Labor from bringing their own independent\naction.\nQUESTION: Of course, the -- the cause of action\nfor -- that EEOC has could be vindicated by an equitable\nremedy.\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't think that's\nnecessarily true. It's certainly not going to be true in\nevery case. And Congress specifically made all forms of\nrelief available to the EEOC in its public enforcement\naction. The court below drew a distinction between\nequitable relief on the one hand and victim-specific\nrelief on the other hand to avoid a perceived conflict\nwith the FAA. But with respect, I don't think there is\nany conflict.\nQUESTION: But in this case then you say EEOC\ncan go into court and that Baker can probably not -- not\nintervene, but the EEOC could get whatever he could have\ngotten and give it to him.\nMR. CLEMENT: That is true, but I don't think\nthat is particularly anomalous or limited to this area of\nlaw.\nTake, for example -- I mean, this Court has held\nthat an individual can agree to arbitrate his or her civil\nRICO claim. I wouldn't think, though, that that agreement\nto arbitrate the civil RICO claim would in any way prevent\nthe Government from bringing a criminal RICO action or\nprevent the Government from getting a restitution order\nthat agreed to give restitution directly to the victim.\nQUESTION: Who had already recovered?\nMR. CLEMENT: No. Let's -- let's take this --\nlet's make it parallel to this case where the\nindividual --\nQUESTION: No. I'm assuming a RICO victim who's\nalready been -- been compensated, and you think the\nGovernment can bring a RICO action in which it gets not\njust criminal sanctions but also requires the -- the RICO\ndefendant to pay again what's already been paid.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, actually they could get the\norder, and then there are specific provisions in the\nFederal restitution statute that allow a set-off for\namounts that have already been paid or that will be paid.\nQUESTION: Oh, well, that's quite different.\nMR. CLEMENT: But I don't think it --\nQUESTION: Okay. Then let's go back -- then\nlet's simply go back to the damages case. You said a\nsecond ago in -- in response or you -- you agreed with the\nsuggestion of mine that in fact the Government can\nperfectly well sue independently.\nMy question then is, why do you concede that the\nsettlement case in which the individual settles for -- for\nmoney in lieu of damages is a harder case? Why don't you\nsay no? It's just as easy as this is. And -- and in\nneither case is the agreement between the individual and\nthe defendant binding or affecting in any way what the\nGovernment can do.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, we don't think the\nagreement is binding, but let me give you three reasons --\nQUESTION: But why -- but --\nMR. CLEMENT: Let me give you three reasons why\nI think it's a harder case.\nQUESTION: -- you did say earlier that you\nthought the settlement case more difficult. So, I guess I\nwant you to explain why you think it is.\nMR. CLEMENT: Okay. Let me give you three\nreasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult.\nFirst, there's already been some expenditure of\nresources in that case, either -- likely, either judicial\nor arbitral.\nSecond, Title VII seems to place particular\nimportance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate\nthe action and consider the early stages of litigation.\nIf, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where\nsomebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has\nalready been filled.\nThe third reason is another particularly\nimportant function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act\nas a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is\nnot willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of\nretaliation or something, in a particular case that\nvindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability\nto step in and fill that gap. If there's already been a\nsettlement --\nQUESTION: Well, but in each of the -- in each\nof the cases that you posit, even the third one, the --\nthe essence of the objection to your position is that an\nagreement has been made between the individual and the\ndefendant. And in the case of the arbitration agreement,\nan agreement has been made between the individual and the\ndefendant. And I don't see why the one class -- the one\nkind of agreement should be treated any differently from\nthe other kind of agreement in determining whether the\nGovernment really is in an autonomous position.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I actually think there is a\nreason to treat that one agreement different, which is the\nagreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to\nrelief. An arbitration agreement does not. It's simply a\nforum selection provision. And the anomaly of the Fourth\nCircuit's ruling is they take an agreement that limits\nBaker's access to a judicial forum, but does not limit his\nremedies and somehow transmogrify it into a rule that\nlimits the EEOC's available remedies but not their access\nto a judicial forum.\nQUESTION: Then your objection is the\ntransmogrification, not to the -- not to the recognition\nof the agreement as such.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, we have no -- absolutely no\nobjection to having the agreement bind the parties to the\nagreement.\nQUESTION: But you do say that the employee\ncould not proceed even in the arbitral forum once the EEOC\nstarts. It's clear in the statute that that's true as to\na court action, but you I thought agreed with me that the\nemployee, once the EEOC starts, can't go into the arbitral\nforum either.\nMR. CLEMENT: Actually the EEOC is of the\nopinion that the -- that the individual could bring an\narbitration action at that point. That is a consequence,\nthough, of the view that they cannot intervene in the\nEEOC's enforcement action. I think -- I think they --\nQUESTION: So, then the EEOC --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- they have to have one action or\nthe other.\nQUESTION: -- says we can have this -- we can\nhave this -- you've just told us that the substantive law\nis the same. And I think you're quite right about that,\nand -- and it's just a question of which forum. But now\nyou're saying it can be both forums simultaneously. The\nindividual can go forward in the arbitration; the EEOC can\ngo forward in the court with all the problems that\nduplicative litigation can have of potentially conflicting\nresults.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's equally, of course -- I\nmean, I -- I agree that there is that problem. That is\nequally a problem with the Fourth Circuit's rule, of\ncourse, because they said that the EEOC could be in court\nseeking general injunctive relief while the individual is\narbitrating his claim for victim-specific relief.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. CLEMENT: But -- but I think --\nQUESTION: -- that doesn't strike me as so\nterrible. I mean, that -- that's entirely understandable.\nYou have two different types of relief being sought in two\ndifferent forums.\nMR. CLEMENT: And -- and --\nQUESTION: What Justice Ginsburg points out is\n-- is the anomaly of -- of the same relief being sought in\ntwo different forums.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, and -- and I think that -- I\nmean, that may be a product of -- that happens when you\nhave an arbitration agreement that limits some parties but\nnot others. That seems to be the case in -- in Moses\nCone.\nQUESTION: Only if we adopt your view of the\nthing, that the two -- that the two are independent. If\n-- if the two are dependent, as the statute makes very\nclear they are when -- when the Government brings --\nbrings the suit first, barring -- barring the individual\nfrom bringing a separate suit, if the two are -- are\ndependent, then you don't face any of these problems.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, fair enough. But in this\ncase, the Government did bring suit first. Baker has\nnever arbitrated. So, that position would lead you to the\nconclusion that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that the\nEEOC can pursue this case, seek victim-specific relief and\ngeneral injunctive relief, and that it's up to you to\ndetermine whether or not Baker gets to intervene in that\naction. But that is -- that is certainly a result that\nthe Government is quite happy with.\nIt seems to me what's really sort of\nindefensible about the Fourth Circuit's reasoning is they\ntake this forum selection provision and turn it into a\nrestriction on remedies. The -- the ADA and Title VII\nhave concurrent jurisdiction.\nSuppose that an employer and an employee agreed\nto litigate their case in State court, not Federal court.\nIt wouldn't seem to me that that forum selection clause\nwould bar the EEOC and bind the EEOC and limit them from\nbringing their public enforcement action in Federal court.\nIt certainly wouldn't seem to me that that agreement to\nlitigate in State court would somehow prevent the EEOC\nfrom getting victim-specific damages in Federal court if\nin fact there was no State court action. But -- but in\nprinciple, there's no difference between the arbitration\nagreement and that forum selection clause agreement that\npicks the State court.\nQUESTION: Except there's a Federal Arbitration\nAct, and we've said it's designed to encourage arbitration\nof disputes.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in fairness, I don't think\nthat the FAA embodies a self-executing preference for\narbitration. The --\nQUESTION: No, but -- a -- a favoring where the\n-- where an arbitration agreement has been entered into,\nas it was here.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, that's true. But I think\nthe purpose of the FAA, as I understand it, was to put\narbitration contracts on an equal footing with other\ncontracts, not to give them some special private place.\nAnd we think that that forum selection clause that picked\nthe State forum would be enforceable between the parties,\nbut we just don't think it makes any sense to say that\nthat agreement between the parties somehow leaps out and\nbars the EEOC from bringing a Federal enforcement action,\nor even more puzzlingly I think, restricting the remedies\navailable to the EEOC in that public enforcement action.\nIt seems to me that at -- at bottom Title VII\ngives the EEOC a right to bring a public enforcement\naction.\nQUESTION: The trouble is it's not a public\nenforcement action to the extent that it is seeking\ndamages for this individual. To that extent, it -- it's\nan action that seeks to compensate this individual for the\ndamage he has suffered. Now, that -- that has some public\nbenefit I -- I assume, just as his own suit, should he\nrecover, would have such -- some public benefit. But to\ncall it a public enforcement action seems to me quite\nunrealistic.\nMR. CLEMENT: With fairness, I think that's a\nposition that Congress rejected in Title VII itself. If\nCongress wanted to say that the only time that the EEOC\nvindicates the public interest is when it seeks general\ninjunctive relief, it would have been quite easy for\nCongress to limit the EEOC to general injunctive relief or\nlimit it to bringing pattern and practice cases. Instead,\nit gave it the right --\nQUESTION: Why? That would have been very\nfoolish. Why -- why require two separate suits: one --\none by the private individual, the other by the -- by the\nagency? If the agency is going to be in there, it may as\nwell go for the whole ball.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: But -- but to say that the portion of\nit that compensates the individual is essentially, you\nknow, a vindication of the public doesn't seem to me --\ndoesn't seem to me reasonable. And -- and that is\ndemonstrated by the fact that if the agency brings the\nsuit, the individual can't because he's going to be\ngetting his individual relief.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, with all respect, I\ndisagree. I think restitution statutes reflect and\nvindicate the public interest, even though the restitution\ngoes to the victim, and not the Government. It's the fact\nthat the --\nQUESTION: If the model -- if the model is the\nFair Labor Standards Act, which antedated these\ndiscrimination acts by many years, where the Secretary can\nsue for the money to go into the pocket of the employee, I\nthought that those were characterized as public interest\nactions.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's absolutely right. I mean,\nevery time a wrongdoer pays money, the payment of that\nmoney serves a public interest that's independent of the\ndestination of the payment, whether it goes to the\nindividual who was wronged or some sort of public\nenforcement action.\nAnd again, I suggest the example of a\nretaliation action. In a retaliation action, when an\nemployer has retaliated against an employee for filing a\ncharge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the\npublic interest when it files suit to take the employer to\ntask for the retaliation. And that's true even if the\nretaliation and the most effective remedies are victim-\nspecific. In a case like that, you really need the\nvictim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear\nas day from Title VII itself that an employer can't\nretaliate against an employee for filing a charge. So, to\nsimply get an injunction that says that is of somewhat\nlimited utility. On the other hand, to get back pay,\ncompensatory and capped punitive damages I think does\nvindicate the public interest.\nQUESTION: Well, what are your best authorities\nfor the proposition that when litigation has been\nconcluded, another party can recommence the litigation\nalleging its own injury?\nMR. CLEMENT: I guess I would point --\nQUESTION: -- some other areas. You cited the\nFirefighters case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes. I would -- I would direct\nyou to Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland. There's a\nstatement in that case that I think was just meant to\nreflect a general principle that parties to a litigation\ncan't, through a settlement, bind a non-party to the\nlitigation.\nQUESTION: Well, but that was because the other\nparties had their own injury of a pecuniary nature, as I\nrecall the case. I -- I don't see the case cited.\nQUESTION: As a practical matter, how often does\nthe EEOC seek victim-specific relief in the form of\nmonetary damages after there's been a settlement between\nthe victim and the other side?\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm actually aware of no case\nwhere that's happened.\nQUESTION: This is all a hypothetical.\nMR. CLEMENT: This is all hypothetical. And\nwhat we're concerned about is a case like this one where\nthere is an arbitration agreement, but the individual has\nnever even sought to arbitrate. I think that's a much\neasier case.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Gordon, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. GORDON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe answer to the question presented today is\nfound in the broad terms and policies of the Federal\nArbitration Act. The question, of course, is what effect\ndoes Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC's\nlitigation remedies.\nThe Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOC\ncould bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctive\nrelief and declaratory relief. However, because Mr. Baker\nhad agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seek\nrelief in court specifically for Mr. Baker.\nNow, I -- I listened carefully to Mr. Clement's\nargument about the issue of settlement of a claim, and I\nmust respectfully disagree with the authority and line of\ncases that he's citing. As a matter of fact, the\nposition, as I understand it from Mr. Clement, is that an\nindividual can settle a claim and then the EEOC can later\nsue on behalf of that individual and recover relief for\nthat individual. And that particular principle, if that\nis what the EEOC is espousing today, contradicts their own\npolicy guidance --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gordon, if I understood him\ncorrectly, he did take that position, but he said you\ndon't have to take that position to prevail in this case.\nIs that right?\nMR. GORDON: Well, perhaps I perceived it\ndifferently, Your Honor.\nBut I -- I do think that from our position it's\nvery important for the Court to understand that the cases\nare almost uniform for the proposition that if an\nindividual settles a case --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gordon, but that's so highly\nhypothetical because the likelihood that the employee\nwould have proceeded -- if the EEOC in the beginning is\nthe only one who can bring an action in court, EEOC brings\nan action. Now, even if it's limited only to injunctive\nrelief, isn't it clear that the basic finding of fact, was\nthere discrimination, has to be made for any kind of\nrelief. And are you going to permit a viable set of\nproceedings to determine that question?\nOnce the EEOC brings in -- the case in court,\nmustn't its suit be given primacy to determine the basic\nquestion, was there discrimination in violation of the\nact?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, we do not believe it\nshould be given primacy when an individual has signed an\narbitration agreement in which he says I agree that all\nclaims arising out of my employment shall be resolved in\narbitration. We don't see any reason why that case needs\nto wait for the EEOC to --\nQUESTION: Well, because one of them has power\nto bind the other. Does it not? I mean, suppose the EEOC\nproceeds and there is a finding that discrimination,\nunlawful under the statute, occurred. That would be\nbinding on the employer in any other forum, wouldn't it\nbe?\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, it should be, but\nthe EEOC doesn't take that position, as I understand it.\nAs I understand their position, whatever happens in their\ncourt proceeding is an independent action and that Mr.\nBaker really doesn't have any control over. And they're\ndoing their own thing in court.\nQUESTION: But we're not talking about Mr.\nBaker. We're talking about the employer who has been\nfound to have been a discriminator. That would have issue\npreclusive effect against the employer in any other forum.\nWe're not talking about the individual now, but we're\ntalking about the employer who has been found to be a\ndiscriminator in a Federal district court.\nMR. GORDON: It would, Your Honor, if there were\nfindings of fact that were common to the other proceeding.\nQUESTION: But the other way around, if the\narbitrator, say, finds no discrimination in that\narbitration forum, couldn't bind the EEOC because the EEOC\nwasn't party to that litigation. Am I right about that?\nMR. GORDON: Well, I would have to disagree with\nyou on that because I believe that in the arbitration, if\nthere were -- an adjudication was made as to Mr. Baker and\nin -- as in this particular case -- if I may use this case\nas the example, in this particular case, Mr. Baker is the\nonly game in town here. The EEOC is seeking relief solely\non behalf of Mr. Baker. All damages will go to Mr. Baker.\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's cut out the relief\naspect of it and again concentrate on the issue, was there\ndiscrimination or not, as to which there might be\ninjunctive remedies. If Mr. -- Mr. Baker loses on that,\nthat can't preclude the EEOC from getting the\ndetermination, was there discrimination.\nSo, the only point I'm making is when you've got\none show that will be binding and the other that can't\npreclude the EEOC from litigating that basic question,\nwhatever remedies would attach to it, doesn't it follow\nthat the EEOC's suit must be allowed to go forward and\nhave the question of discrimination determined in that\nforum?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, I -- I still believe\nthat there's no reason to wait in this case, that the\narbitration can go forward to resolve Mr. Baker's\nindividual claims, that the EEOC, under the Fourth Circuit\nrule, can go forward and have the claims for broad-based\ninjunctive relief heard there.\nAnd I -- I must say that there may be separate\nissues being litigated in that EEOC court proceeding\nbecause --\nQUESTION: But isn't it true that for any\nrelief, there must be a finding that the employer has\nviolated the act?\nMR. GORDON: There must be, but in the court\nproceeding, there's going to be a broader finding, that\nthere is some pattern or practice of discrimination going\non that may or -- may or may not apply to Mr. Baker. If\nit does apply to Mr. Baker, I would agree with you. Then\nthat particular ruling would have some collateral estoppel\neffect in the arbitration.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what is your position\n-- maybe you've answered this. What is your position if\nthe employer and the employee arbitrate and there's a\nfinding of no liability, no wrong on -- no wrong committed\nby the employer? The EEOC then sues. Is the EEOC not\nbound by the liability finding?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, in that particular\ncase, if the arbitrator makes a ruling that there was some\npractice --\nQUESTION: No. My hypothetical is the\narbitrator rules for the employer. No discrimination.\nThere was no firing in violation of the ADA. The employer\nwas taking -- the employee was taking money or something.\nThat -- that was the reason. Can the EEOC then re-\nlitigate the issue of liability?\nMR. GORDON: Not that particular very issue of\nliability, but what I'm -- what I'm anticipating --\nQUESTION: And why -- and why is that?\nMR. GORDON: What I -- what I'm anticipating --\nQUESTION: Why is it that the employer cannot --\nthat the EEOC cannot re-litigate the raw finding of\nliability?\nMR. GORDON: I am anticipating from your\nhypothetical that a specific finding is being made about\nMr. Baker being discriminated against based on the facts\nand circumstances of his case. What I am anticipating\ngoing in the court proceeding is some claim for broad-\nbased injunctive relief that may -- may involve Mr. Baker\nand may not.\nQUESTION: I just want to make it clear what\nyour position is. Is it your position that when the EEOC\nsues in -- in the Federal court and there has been a\nprevious finding of -- of non-liability on the part of the\nemployer, that the employer did not discriminate against\nthis person, is the EEOC bound in court by that finding?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, the EEOC, to the extent\nthat it's bringing a public enforcement action, something\ninvolving a pattern or practice of discrimination,\nsomething --\nQUESTION: Suppose it's not. Suppose it's just\ninterested in this --\nMR. GORDON: Just --\nQUESTION: -- employee and it's going to base\nthe injunction on the wrong that the employer allegedly\ncommitted against this employee, but the arbitrator has\nfound that there is no such violation.\nMR. GORDON: If it -- if the injunction is\nsolely based on relief specific to Mr. Baker and the facts\nof his case, yes, it would be binding.\nQUESTION: And what's your authority for that\nproposition?\nMR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nauthority would be that based on general principles of\ncollateral estoppel where there's been -- these issues\nhave been litigated and --\nQUESTION: Against a particular person. I\nthought the basic principle of preclusion was that someone\nwho has not litigated cannot be bound. You would have to\nestablish that there was some kind of privity between the\nemployee and the EEOC, but I think that would be certainly\nunprecedented. The main rule is you have a right to a day\nin court, not two days in court, and if the EEOC has not\nbeen a party in the arbitral forum, I don't see how it can\nbe bound, unless you're making up some new preclusion\nrule.\nMR. GORDON: No, Your Honor, I'm not making --\nQUESTION: Or unless you say the statutory\nscheme necessarily finds that there is privity because the\nEEOC's interests in this case, where there's no broad\npattern or practice, are allied solely with those of the\n-- of the employee. But it's -- it's a little odd to say\nthat a party in privity is -- is bound if that party\ncannot intervene in those proceedings when it's a public\nagency. But it seems to me that that has to be your --\nyour proposition.\nMR. GORDON: Well, it is and it runs throughout\nour brief, Your Honor, and it runs throughout what I'm --\nwhat I'm going to say to the Court is that basically what\n-- what is happening here, in the -- in the terms of\nseeking individual relief, is that the EEOC is acting on\nbehalf of Mr. Baker.\nQUESTION: Why -- why --\nQUESTION: The EEOC is -- is effectively a party\nto the earlier proceeding since its right in the later\nproceeding is purely derivative of the right of -- of the\nindividual employee. That's essentially what you're\nurging.\nMR. GORDON: It is, Your Honor, and -- and\nessentially the EEOC is standing in the shoes of Mr. Baker\nwhen you look at this case because it is -- if you look at\nthe joint appendix, page 51 and 52, the interrogatory\nresponses from the EEOC, you see that they acknowledge\nthey are seeking -- when asked what -- what damages are\nyou seeking in this case, we are seeking relief on behalf\nof Mr. Baker.\nQUESTION: That -- that happens to be in this\ncase. They might have said that.\nDoesn't the EEOC also pursue a public interest?\nI mean, can't the EEOC -- imagine individuals who don't\nwant to bring suits. They don't care. They're cowed or\nthey just don't care. And the EEOC says, I don't care\nwhether you want to bring a suit or not; we're bringing\nit. Now, isn't that part of the EEOC's job to see that\nemployers don't discriminate? And isn't there a public\ninterest in that, as well as the private interest?\nMR. GORDON: There is, Your Honor. There's a\npublic interest in a case such as that, and there's also a\npublic interest in any claim that an individual brings to\nvindicate the anti-discrimination --\nQUESTION: But isn't there a public interest?\nDidn't Congress set this statute up so that it is more is\ninvolved than a simple tort action or a simple contract\naction? There's a public policy in the United States\nagainst this kind of discrimination embodied in many laws,\nand this is one of those laws.\nMR. GORDON: True, Your Honor, but that public\ninterest can be vindicated just as effectively in\narbitration.\nQUESTION: That's the question. If a person\nthen in your view says to the EEOC, my employer\ndiscriminated against me because I'm black or because of\ngender or whatever, no doubt, but I like peace; I don't\nwant to bother him; I'm a little worried about it; okay,\ndrop it, if the EEOC says, I don't want to drop it, do\nthey not have that right?\nMR. GORDON: They can continue to pursue that\nclaim for broad-based injunctive relief involved. But --\nbut here's the rub.\nQUESTION: I'm talking about can they not get\nappropriate relief. That's what the statute says.\nMR. GORDON: It does say that, and the relief\nwould not be appropriate where an individual has signed an\nagreement to arbitrate.\nQUESTION: I'm not -- I'm asking you my\nquestion, not your question. I, at the moment, have an\nindividual who doesn't care, doesn't really want the suit\nbrought, says to the EEOC drop it, forget it. The EEOC\nsays, we don't want to forget it. There's -- I'm just\nrepeating myself. So, what's the answer to my case?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORDON: Well -- well, the answer to your\ncase I think is found in the Federal Arbitration Act\nbecause this individual agreed to arbitrate --\nQUESTION: I'm not -- there is no arbitration\nagreement in my case. It's a person. You're quite right.\nAs soon as you answer my question, I'm then going to ask\nyou why does it matter that there's an arbitration\nagreement.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But I'd like you to start with my\ncase.\nMR. GORDON: All right. Your Honor, if -- may I\nask you to again assert your proposition?\nQUESTION: The person is lazy, frightened, or\nwhatever and says to the EEOC, I don't want you to bring\nthis action to get me reinstated. Forget it. Drop it.\nI'm indifferent. Does the EEOC have the legal power to\nsay we don't care? We have a public interest here. We\nwant to bring this suit anyway because we don't think it's\nright for the employer to discriminate against you. We\nwant to make an example of him. Okay?\nMR. GORDON: Yes.\nQUESTION: They can do that.\nMR. GORDON: They can do that.\nQUESTION: Fine. Now, my question is, when they\ncan do that, why does it matter if there's an arbitration\nagreement since once you -- all right. Go ahead. Why\ndoes it matter?\nMR. GORDON: Well, there is, of course, the --\nthe strong Federal policy favoring arbitration, the text\nof the Federal Arbitration Act that says, we're going to\nenforce agreements.\nQUESTION: And, of course, my example is\ndesigned to show that all those interests have to do with\nthe private interest of the individual perhaps.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gordon --\nQUESTION: Not the other. That's why I asked --\nQUESTION: -- I think -- I think it is your\nposition, is it not, that the -- that the agency would not\nbe able to bring such a suit if the individual had already\nsued and had been compensated, or indeed, if the -- if the\nindividual had already settled?\nMR. GORDON: True.\nQUESTION: Isn't that your position?\nMR. GORDON: True.\nQUESTION: And -- and your further position is\nthat the -- that the conclusion of an arbitration\nagreement is similar to a settlement, that the agency's\nability to bring the later suit depends on what the\nindividual, on whose behalf it sues, has given away.\nMR. GORDON: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Good. That's perfect. That's just\nmy question. Why is this arbitration agreement more like\nthe settlement than it is like the instance we both\nagreed, the indifferent employee?\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, the EEOC in these cases\n-- and I hope I can be responsive to your question. The\nEEOC in these cases takes its employee as it finds it, and\nin this particular case, the employee has an arbitration\nagreement. And individual conduct can limit the ability\nof the EEOC to seek remedies in a case. It happens in a\nnumber of different contexts.\nQUESTION: But the remedy -- I think we've\nagreed that what we're not talking about here is the\nsubstantive law -- the substantive right and the remedy.\nIt is simply a choice of forum clause. And if you have\ntwo parties that have a substantive right, who can assert\nthe substantive right, one of them is bound by a choice of\nforum clause. That's where that party must go. And the\nother one is not so bound. Then how do you stop the EEOC\nfrom choosing its forum?\nThe same question with respect to suppose it had\nbeen a State human rights commission that is going into\nthe State court, and the employer says, no, State human\nrights commission, you can't do that because this employee\nhas signed an agreement to arbitrate.\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, the -- the notion of\nthe importance of the Federal Arbitration Act is that\nthese agreements have to be put on the same footing as\nother contracts, and we must give force to an arbitration\nagreement such as this. And to allow parties to come up\nwith ways to get around these agreements completely\nundercuts the Federal Arbitration Act.\nAnd I -- I would disagree with your premise, if\nI -- if I may, respectfully, that arbitration is a forum\nselection clause. It's a lot more than that. It is a --\nit is a method of resolving employment disputes.\nQUESTION: But do you -- procedural mode, but do\nyou -- you don't contest, do you, that Title VII or the\ndisability act or the -- whatever Federal law is the law\nthat the arbitrator is to apply so that the substantive\nlaw to be applied, whether you're in court or in\narbitration, is the same? It would be Title VII. It\nwould be the Disabilities Act. You're not suggesting that\nthe arbitrator can apply some other brand of Federal law\nthan the Federal court would apply, are you?\nMR. GORDON: No, I'm not. But --\nQUESTION: So, we're talking about the forum and\nforums have rules of procedure, which can be different,\nbut the substantive law is the same. It is Title VII or\nthe Disabilities Act.\nMR. GORDON: That's true, Your Honor, but -- but\nstill if we -- if we go forward with the rule that's\nproposed by the EEOC, in -- in my view we will be flying\nin the face of the Court's decisions in Gilmer, the\nCourt's decision in Circuit City, the plain text of the\nFederal Arbitration Act. We will be discouraging rather\nthan encouraging arbitration, and --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Gordon, I assume that\ngiving up the whole cause of action is the greater and\ngiving up the forum is the lesser. Isn't your response\nthat if -- if the EEOC is bound by a settlement agreement,\na fortiori it should be bound by an agreement only to\nbring the suit in a particular forum, if indeed its action\nis derivative of the individual's action. The greater\nincludes the lesser, and surely giving up the whole cause\nof action, if that binds the EEOC, is greater than giving\nup simply the forum in which the cause of action can be\nbrought.\nMR. GORDON: True, and if you take a step back\n-- and let's -- let's take the more general -- general\nexample where there -- there hasn't been a claim filed and\nwhere an individual is having a dispute with his employer.\nAnd the employer says, I will give you $300 in exchange\nfor a -- a settlement agreement, a release of all claims.\nIt doesn't involve where an EEOC charge has been filed or\nwhere there's a court case going on. The EEOC and the\ncourts take the position that that particular scenario\nwould preclude it from later seeking relief on behalf of\nthat individual in court.\nQUESTION: Why is this greater? You agreed that\nthis is a -- this is the greater, the arbitration.\nThe way I'm seeing it, which you can correct, is\nthat the word in the statute is appropriate relief, and\nthat there's a spectrum. On the one hand, we have the\nindifferent employee. Next is the one with an arbitration\nagreement who doesn't enforce it. Next is the one who is\nin the middle of arbitration. Next is the one who has\nbeen through arbitration and gotten some money, and\nfinally, at the far end we have a settlement. And whether\neach of those is appropriate, circumstances for the EEOC\nto proceed might differ one from the other. But certainly\nthe arbitration case is in the middle. It's not way over\nat the extreme. So, what -- what is your response?\nMR. GORDON: I can't accept the spectrum\nanalysis, if -- if I may. I have to revert to the fact\nthat -- that the individual signed the agreement to\narbitrate. Once signing that agreement to arbitrate, then\nhe must pursue his individual claims in that forum and he\ncannot hand off the ball to the EEOC and have the EEOC do\nfor him what he cannot do for himself, which is get\nindividual relief in court. That was the bargain that\nWaffle House made with this employee.\nQUESTION: Would that carry over to, say, wage\nand hour claims? Equal pay -- I guess the Equal Pay Act\nis the closest.\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Could the Secretary of Labor also be\nin privity with the individual employee who hasn't -- who\nhas been denied equal pay?\nMR. GORDON: Under the -- under the wage/hour\nlaws --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GORDON: -- there -- there are different\ninterests there. For example, the -- the Department of\nLabor has to approve a settlement of a wage/hour claim\nbecause of the public policy involved in making sure that\nthe lowest wage earners in our society get a particular\nwage.\nIt's different on an ADA claim, for example.\nThe EEOC does not have to approve the settlement of a\nclaim.\nQUESTION: How about an Equal Pay Act claim?\nMR. GORDON: Equal Play Act claim, Your Honor, I\nbelieve would be covered under the Department of Labor\nscenario.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gordon, may I just ask you a\nquestion sort of about the other end of this case? Let's\nassume that -- well, let's assume that there are parallel\nproceedings going on and that the EEOC suit comes to\nresolution first.\nNow, you -- you are -- you at least agree that\nthe -- that the EEOC can get what I think you have\ndescribed as sort of generalized equitable remedies on --\non -- in -- in the public interest. Would those remedies\n-- let's -- let's assume a case in which the EEOC sues on\nbehalf of the individual who is subject to the particular\narbitration agreement, say, in this case, but also brings\nin a -- in effect, a -- a class-wide claim and said, you\nknow, there are -- we'll prove that there are hundreds of\nother individuals who have suffered the same -- what is it\n-- Title I violation that this individual suffered. Can\nthe -- and let's assume that in -- in the -- the EEOC\nsuit, that they prove that. Can the EEOC get generally\nclass-wide remedy as -- as part of its general equitable\nrelief?\nMR. GORDON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Would that include back pay?\nMR. GORDON: No, it would not where there's\nbeen --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. GORDON: When there's been an arbitration\nagreement.\nQUESTION: Well, not back pay for this\nindividual. Back pay for everybody in the class except\nthis individual. This is just -- I just want to know what\nyour position is.\nMR. GORDON: Our position would be, Your Honor,\nthat for those individuals who have signed arbitration\nagreements, then any relief specific to them must be\nawarded in arbitration. For those individuals who have\nnot signed arbitration agreements, then that EEOC class-\nwide relief action could encompass their claim for relief\nin court. But to give force to the arbitration agreements\nthat have been signed by the individuals, the -- the\ngeneral --\nQUESTION: Okay, but then -- then I -- is it\nalso your position that the -- that the general equitable\nrelief could not include an injunction to rehire all of\nthose who were improperly fired?\nMR. GORDON: The -- the equitable relief\nspecific to the individual -- specific to the\nindividual --\nQUESTION: Well, the injunction is just a\ngeneral injunction. It says, rehire the people in this\nclass whom you unlawfully fired in -- in violation of this\ntitle. Can -- can they get that relief on your theory?\nCan the EEOC get that relief on your theory?\nMR. GORDON: It could if the relief was broad-\nbased and not --\nQUESTION: Well, in my example, it's broad-\nbased in the sense that it applies to everyone in the\nclass, but in order to enforce it, it will have to be\nenforced against specific individuals. Somebody quite\napart from this proceeding will come forward and say, I'm\none of them. You've got to rehire me. Can the injunction\nbe -- be enforced in that case?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, it could, but --\nQUESTION: Then why can't back pay be enforced\nin that case?\nMR. GORDON: But -- but -- well, it would be\nenforced in arbitration. The relief specific to the\nindividual would be enforced in arbitration.\nQUESTION: No. You -- if I -- if I understood\nwhat you just said -- maybe I didn't -- the -- the\ninjunction to rehire those who were improperly fired could\nbe enforced in -- in court. In other words, there's an\ninjunction and a court that issued the injunction can\nenforce it. Is that correct?\nMR. GORDON: The determination would be in\ncourt.\nQUESTION: All right. Then why -- why would not\na similar determination and a similar power effect a back\npay -- generalized back pay order? Give back pay to all\nof those -- not this guy, but to all of those in the class\ngenerally who were improperly fired.\nMR. GORDON: Well, it could, Your Honor. In\ncourt a determination such as that could be made that\nthese individuals have been discriminated against and\ntherefore remedies are available to them. But the actual\ndetermination of the remedies must be made in arbitration\nfor those individuals who signed arbitration --\nQUESTION: I can understand why you say that,\nbut I don't understand why you say that a -- a general\nequitable order to rehire could be enforced in court and\nwould not have to be remitted to an arbitral forum.\nMR. GORDON: The determination could be made in\ncourt, but the determination of what specific equitable\nrelief, whether this person should be reinstated or -- or\nthis person should not, that should be made in\narbitration.\nQUESTION: So, in -- the only thing that on your\ntheory then that is totally within the control of the\ncourt would be totally prospective relief, e.g., an order,\ndon't do this again for anybody. That would be\nenforceable in court.\nMR. GORDON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And purely in court.\nMR. GORDON: That would be.\nQUESTION: And let's say -- let's say a claim is\nmade then later on that that order has been violated, that\nthe title has been violated again, and the injunction\nagainst violating the title has been -- has been violated.\nAnd let's assume that the employee who claims that -- that\nhe is the subject of that violation has also signed an\narbitration agreement. Does it have to go to arbitration?\nMR. GORDON: Well, in that particular case, Your\nHonor, I believe there would be contempt --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GORDON: -- of the injunction. The contempt\nwould be enforced in court.\nQUESTION: But why isn't your -- why isn't your\nclaim to the vindication of the arbitration agreement the\nsame in the future case as it was in the past case?\nMR. GORDON: Because the relief that is awarded\nto a particular individual is awarded in arbitration.\nAssuming that relief was awarded, then that would probably\nend the participation of the arbitrator at that point.\nQUESTION: The contempt action wouldn't be\nbrought by either the EEOC or -- or the individual, I\nassume. It would be brought by the United States attorney\nor, as we have said, some attorney appointed by the court.\nMR. GORDON: Your Honor, the Court -- the Court\nshould not allow -- and I think this is the central --\ncentral theme of -- of our argument here. The Court\nshould not allow the EEOC and its charging party who comes\nto it with an arbitration agreement to frustrate the\npurposes of the Federal Arbitration Act by making this end\nrun around the agreement. Mr. Baker entered into a\nprivate agreement with Waffle House to resolve any\ndisputes he has arising out of his employment. The\nCourt --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gordon, in -- in the history of\nthe anti-discrimination acts, there was legislative\nhistory that said the EEOC should be the main player; that\nis, they should be the main enforcer of these anti-\ndiscrimination laws. Now, that model, which would have\ntaken a lot more money than Congress has appropriated to\ncarry out -- but that model simply could not be realized\nunder your view of things because the Federal Arbitration\nAct would always take primacy, I think you -- you put it.\nBut the notion that the EEOC ought to be running\nthese discrimination actions -- they are the main show,\nand then the individual actions can supplement that. But\n-- but you couldn't have that model effected under your\nview of it because the arbitration agreement could always\ncome in and interfere with it.\nMR. GORDON: Well, I think we should -- should\ntake account of what the EEO still is able to do under the\nFourth Circuit's rule. The EEOC is still able to\neffectuate the public interest by seeking broad-based\ninjunctive relief. The EEOC is still able to get an\ninjunction telling an employer that you are to certain\nthings with the way you run your business. The EEOC still\nhas the opportunity to tell an employer that you must\nreport back to us on a regular basis to tell us how you're\ncomplying with the employment discrimination laws.\nInjunctive relief is not a toothless remedy.\nBut I will -- I will say one other thing.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Does it have to wait for\nthe -- for the arbitration to be completed before it\nbrings such a suit?\nMR. GORDON: Before the EEOC brings a public --\nQUESTION: Before it brings such a suit based\nupon the violation against an employee who has signed an\narbitration agreement.\nMR. GORDON: No, Your Honor. It could -- it\ncould file its own action for broad-based injunctive\nrelief if it wished.\nQUESTION: And -- and injunctive relief based\nupon the violation that is the same subject as the\narbitration proceeding.\nMR. GORDON: It could if there is a pattern and\npractice involved in that scenario.\nQUESTION: I don't know what you mean.\nMR. GORDON: Well, if there is a policy, for\nexample, that is the root cause of --\nQUESTION: Well, that's fine. It says that\npolicy is reflected in this one instance, and -- and it's\nthe same instance that's -- that's before arbitration.\nWhat happens?\nMR. GORDON: Well, in that case, Your Honor, if\nthe only -- if I'm -- if the only game in town is that Mr.\nBaker was discriminated against, and that's it, and there\nare no general -- general -- there's no general relief\nbeing sought, we're just mad about the employment decision\ndirected toward him, then if the EEOC was in court just on\nthat theory and was unable to show any broader\napplication, then that -- the court should dismiss that\ncase.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gordon.\nMr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to first pick up on Justice Souter's\nhypothetical about the contempt proceeding. It seems to\nme that if that were enforced by civil compensatory\ncontempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought\nby the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the same\nproblem at the end of the day.\nRespondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC\nhas to take the victim as we find him. The problem with\nthat is that principle applies with respect to damages\nproblems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the\nindividual employee whether or not he arbitrates or\nlitigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement\naction and to the individual claim.\nWhat's so unique about this is that respondent\nis attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict\nBaker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration\nproceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies\navailable to the EEOC in its action.\nThe problem is, this is not, at bottom, a\nrestriction on damages or a problem with remedies. It is\na forum selection clause. And you have a statutory\nstructure that allows two people to initiate an action.\nWhen one of those parties has signed a forum selection\nclause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that\neven in the general case there would be no reason to\nrestrict the other party's access to forums or their\nremedies. That would seem to be a fortiori true for a\nstatute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of\nfirst refusal over the initiation of the action.\nAnother point I'd like to emphasize is that, as\nJustice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits\npending against employers in a situation where there has\nbeen a previous settlement. In fact, there are only 450\nsuits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and\nI think that puts this case in perspective. In the\nliterally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration\nagreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that\nwill be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration.\nIn the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where\nthere's some important public principle at stake or\nthere's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public\nenforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that\nallows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting\nin public judicial proceedings.\nThe third and final point I'd like to make is\nthat whatever the answer is in the settlement context,\nthere's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that\nonly restricts the available forum and not the remedies\nand turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the\nforum. Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to\nthe results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC\nfrom seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any\narbitration proceeding initiated at all.\nFor those reasons, we ask you to reverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\n"
