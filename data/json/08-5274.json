        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-5274, Dean v. United States.\nMr. Forster.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FORSTER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThe issue before the Court in this case is\nwhether the discharge provision of 924(c) carries with\nit some requirement of intent. We believe that the\nanswer to this question is yes. And to that end we\nwould cite to the leg -- to the text of the statute\nitself as well as the history involved, the presumption\nof mens rea that is inherent in all statutes such as\nthis Court's case law has been clear on as well as the\nprinciple of the rule of lenity, if we get to that\npoint, and if the Court deems that there is some type of\nambiguity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Forster, there are\nthree levels under this: Possession, brandishing, and\nif the gun is discharged. You don't quarrel with the\nnotion that Dean at least brandished this gun?\nMR. FORSTER: We -- we do not dispute that,\nYour Honor. No, he clearly intentionally brandished the\nweapon.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're talking about a\nthree-year difference between brandishing and if the gun\nis discharged?\nMR. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor, that's\nexactly right. And the statute in 924 requires that the\nuse of the firearm be during and in relation to the\nunderlying crime of violence, which in this case is a\nbank robbery. And we believe that the proper reading of\nthe statute would require that the discharge also be\ndone during and in relation to the underlying crime of\nviolence. Otherwise, the statute simply would not make\nany sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think one of the\nstronger arguments against you is the use of the passive\nvoice. It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm.\nIt says a firearm is discharged. And that seems to me\nto take it away from the element of intent that you're\ntrying to focus on.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I think that it's\na transitive verb the way it's used. By definition it\nwould have some object. Someone would have had to have\ndischarged the weapon. And so I think that the Court's\ncases on mens rea and so forth would continue to apply,\neven given the way that it's phrased in the statute. I\ndon't think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's\ndifferent -- I don't remember the grammar too well. You\nthink \"if firearm is discharged\" is different than\n\"firearm discharges;\" is that your point?\nMR. FORSTER: I'm not sure it would make a\ndifference in this case, Your Honor, because I don't\nthink there's any -- I think that by definition the\nCourt would have to ask itself who discharged the\nweapon. I don't think you can just use the word\n\"discharge\" in a vacuum. It has to be during --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure\nthat's right. I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries\nto flee and the security guard is forced to use his\nfirearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the\nbank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as\nwell.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthe statute would, because the individual who would be\ncharged with it would not himself have \"during\" or \"and\nin relation to\" the underlying crime of violence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't say -- it\nsays, \"if the gun is discharged.\" And I think on the\ngovernment's reading it would cover the police officer\nwho is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun.\nMR. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor, I think under\nthe government's theory that would be true. But I think\nthat would open up --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what --\nI guess I'm not following this. You say it would be\ntrue that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his\nown gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that\nwould come within this?\nMR. FORSTER: No, Justice Scalia, not under\nour reading. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say under the\ngovernment's it would? I don't think it would under the\ngovernment's either. Do you?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have to use or carry\nthe firearm before -- before section 2 even applies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's the police\nofficer who snatches the gun.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, that's different, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's different.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's using the\nrobber's gun, but by the police officer who is\napprehending him. In other words, as I understand the\ngovernment's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the\npolice officer. It has to be the gun of the robber, but\nit doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police\nofficer who discharges it.\nMR. FORSTER: That's true, ma'am.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess it's also the\ngovernment's view -- this is even weirder -- that it\ndoesn't matter who brandishes the gun. The -- the bank\nguard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that\nalso gets additional time served for the bank robber.\nIt doesn't seem fair.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthat the -- that the hypothetical of the guard waving\nthe gun around, I don't think that would meet the\ndefinition of \"brandish\" the way 924 defines it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has very specific --\nwhat are the words that define what is brandishing?\nMR. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, \"brandish\"\nis defined under the statute a couple of different ways.\nThe -- the dictionary definition of \"brandish,\" which is\nto grab something and wave it around, is certainly\ncontained in that.\nBut the definition goes further. The\ndefinition also says that if I, for example, make known\nthat I have a gun, if I pass a note saying I have a gun,\nthat would also be brandishing under the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't think the\ngovernment or anybody was reading the definition of\nbrandishing to include a police officer.\nMR. FORSTER: The way the government's brief\n-- well, with regards to brandish, Your Honor, I don't\nknow that the government goes that far.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it runs into the\nproblem, which is also a different problem for you, and\nthat is the brandishing must be for the purposes -- for\nthe purpose of intimidating.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that's probably going to\neliminate the case in which the officer grabs the\nfelon's gun. So the problem that it seems to me that it\ncreates for you is that \"brandish\" is specifically\ndefined to have that particular intentional element.\nThere is, however, no definition of -- of the -- of the\nterm in question here, which suggests that they did not\nhave any discharge -- that they did not have any --\nany -- any intent to impose an intent requirement. When\nthey do it, they know how to do it. In this case they\ndidn't do it.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I would disagree\nwith that simply for this reason. This Court's case law\nis clear that if Congress wants to do away with the mens\nrea element, they must affirmatively do so. And I don't\nthink that it's proper to say that because there's a\nspecific definition of \"brandish,\" therefore they meant\ndischarge to be basically strict liability.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it improper? I\nmean, it may not be conclusive, but it seems to me\nevidence that points in that direction.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I think that that\nwould be disregarding the presumption of mens rea that\nexists pursuant to this Court's case law as well as the\nrequirement --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We have -- we have lots of\ncases in which it makes sense to disregard that\npresumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I\nmean, accomplice liability being an example.\nThere are -- there are -- there are lots of\nState crimes in which it is dispensed with, reckless\ndriving, death resulting. And in all of those cases\nwhat in effect the rationale is that the -- that the\nindividual who is being charged has created a risk, no\none can control that risk, including himself. But he\nbears the responsibility for, if you will, bad luck if\nthe risk is realized. And that is the rationale for --\nfor holding him liable for discharge here without any\nparticular knowing or -- or intentional act in making\nthe discharge.\nSo why doesn't that make sense and why is\nthat not an answer to the usual presumption that there\nwill be a specific state of mind required?\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't think this\nstatute is driven by consequence. And as I understand\nYour Honor's hypothetical --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why? Why?\nMR. FORSTER: Because the words that the\nstatute uses are directly focused to the -- to the\nconduct of the defendant: \"Possess, use, brandish,\ndischarge,\" as opposed to, for example, carjacking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is conduct. I\nmean, it isn't just bad luck. This is -- what we have\nhere is a negligent bank robber. I mean, he has left\nthe safety off, okay, and -- and trips the gun. I mean,\nbank robbing is bad enough, but negligent bank robbing\nis something --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is something that should\nbe punished more severely.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, certainly under\nthe statute the Court has far more authority than the\nten years it imposed, and I think Congress is clear that\nthey -- they allowed for substantially larger sentences\nin such a case. This case obviously just discusses the\napplication of the mandatory minimum.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your\nargument would give rise to very serious problems of\nproof. Every time a gun goes off, the bank robber would\nbe able to say it was an accident. I mean, we had a\nparticularly klutzy robber here that everybody agrees it\nwas an accident, but, you know, in many cases it won't\nbe clear.\nYes, I was pointing the gun at the person,\nbut I didn't mean to fire it. It just went off. And\nhe's sad about it just as everyone else is. And that\nwould get to the jury in every case.\nJust because it was easy here doesn't mean\nit's going to be easy every time to draw a line. And it\ngets back to Justice Souter's point. If you pose the\nrisk that the gun is going to go off, that's\nadditionally punishable conduct.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, obviously -- I\nmean, the risk certainly does go up. But as I -- as I\nthink the statute is written, it's not driven by what\nthe risk is. As I say, as opposed to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not my\nquestion, really. The question is the problem of proof.\nYours is an easy case. Most cases it's not going to be.\nMost cases when the gun goes off, the robber will be\nable to say, I didn't intend that it discharged. It\nwas -- it was an accident.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe a\njury would be -- would make that decision, because under\nthis Court's authority in Harris, that would be for the\njudge; and -- and obviously criminals would make these\nclaims, and it would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me? That would be\nfor the judge?\nMR. FORSTER: Under this Court's authority\nin Harris, Your Honor, brandish and discharge are not\nelements of the offense that must be indicted and proved\nto a jury. They are sentencing elements or enhancement,\nif you will, that -- that would be up to the judge, and\nthat's this Court's Harris ruling.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that undermine your\nargument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has\nto apply, because this is just a sentencing element?\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't believe\nso. This Court has never said that merely because it is\na sentencing enhancement rather than an element of the\noffense that somehow the statutory rules of construction\ncease to apply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it part of the\nbackground here that it was proposed at the time these\nenhancements came into the law, it was proposed that\nthere be a specific state of mind requirement for the\ndischarge of the gun, and that was not enacted?\nMR. FORSTER: I didn't hear the -- I'm\nsorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that part of\nthe legislative history was that there were proposals --\nI mean, there is a rather sharp difference between\n\"possess\" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent\nelement -- \"brandishing,\" very clear, for purposes of\nintimidation -- then \"discharge\" has no -- it's just\nthat the gun is discharged.\nWeren't there proposals to include something\nlike what was included for the other two, that is, that\nthere be an intent requirement?\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, there were various\ndrafts in the House and the Senate that -- that\nspecifically provided the intent requirement. The\ncompromise that came out was basically a disagreement\nover the penalty, and the language that the Congress\nused, \"during and in relation to,\" necessarily implies\nsome type of an intent element. I think the circuits\nare clear on that; it has to be knowing, otherwise it's\nnot during and in relation to.\nAnd so I believe that the choice of language\nthat Congress uses -- there has to be the connection, we\nbelieve, between the use -- during in relation to and\nthe discharge. Otherwise the statute makes no sense,\nbecause it wouldn't be triggered by anything.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? I can't get anywhere\nwith the language, to tell you the truth. I could read\nit either way. It -- the House language is the same.\nThe person \"discharges,\" yeah, but what if he discharges\nit accidentally? Is the accidental case or unintended\ncase meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?\nMR. FORSTER: We don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you don't get anywhere\n-- I just can't get anywhere with the language. The\nreason they put the \"is discharged\" is probably for\nparallelism. It was a drafting section in the Senate,\nand they do their job in a stylistic way. I found\nnothing that suggests anything other than that.\nSo -- so where am I? Sometimes a person who\ndischarges the weapon accidentally is really much worse\nthan the one who does it purposely. Purposely, he\nshoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person\ndead; okay? So I mean, I can't get too far with that.\nSo where -- so there we are. Is there\nanything else -- there is the post problem that the\nChief Justice mentioned. Is there anything else you can\nsay to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the\nother way in this statute?\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you say, look, this\nis why you win?\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, in the committee\nreports and so forth I think it's pretty clear that they\ndid not intend an unintentional or an accidental\ndischarge to be covered.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why do you think\nthat? I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who\nis a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it,\nand it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a\ntremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally\nhas been thought meriting a higher sentence.\nAnd it is also true that he doesn't have the\nsame state of mind as the one who does it purposely.\nThat is true, too. Both are true. And so now what\nshould I do? I know what you want me to do, but why?\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, the requirement --\nwe think that the discharge again must be during and in\nrelation to. There has to be that connection. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- it's during the\nbank robbery.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's in relation to the --\nI mean, you know, in a sense it is, in a sense it isn't;\nsame problem.\nMR. FORSTER: I don't think this case --\nthis Court's case law would support a finding that an\naccidental use would have been in relation to. That's\nthis Court's ruling in Smith.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there's accidents\nand accidents. And couldn't one say, looking at this\nthat, well, we will -- the State will find that the\nculpability that we will attribute to this statute is\nreckless? If recklessness were the requirement\ncertainly the facts in this case would fit, would they\nnot?\nMR. FORSTER: I think that the evidence\nwould suggest that he was reckless --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You accept that --\nMR. FORSTER: -- but I don't believe that it\nwas knowing. And then I think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You say reckless is not\nenough, it has to be knowing. This is not a mere\naccident. It's -- this -- the gun was loaded, it wasn't\nlocked, and he's raking in money with one hand, holding\nthe gun with the other. The teller is crouching down.\nI mean, there was -- there was a pretty substantial risk\nof something going wrong, right?\nMR. FORSTER: Absolutely, there was. But I\nthink this Court's authority in Smith talks about the --\nthe intent element that is inherent in this. It has to\nbe purposeful, it has -- it cannot be by accident, and\nthat's what this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? You place a lot of\nreliance on this: During and in relation to any crime\nof violence or drug trafficking crime. But that --\nthat's in the prologue, and it applies only to the\nmatter covered in the prologue -- to wit, \"During and in\nrelation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking\ncrime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court\nof the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in\nfurtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm.\"\nThat -- that's what all that language\n\"during and relation to\" applies to. And then it\ncontinues: \"Shall,\" if that \"in relation to\" exists,\n\"in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:\"\nOne, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less\nthan five\"; two; and number three, what we're dealing\nwith here, \"if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced\nto a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years.\"\nI don't see how that language during and in\nrelation to any crime of violence applies to anything,\nexcept the use or carrying of a firearm.\nMR. FORSTER: Justice Scalia, sir, we\nbelieve that the proper -- that the better reading would\nbe some connection between those two, between the\ndischarge and the underlying, the during and relation\nto.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? How could you\n-- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer\nthan by ending the first, the introduction with a dash,\nand then putting 1, 2, and 3? I mean, it seems to me\nthat it applies to the portion before the dash.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, if that were the\n-- if that were the interpretation, then it would lead\nto what we consider to be some of the absurdities as far\nas the results go. If there is no connection between\n\"during and in relation to\" -- I will refer to it as the\nconnection. In absence of that connection, any number\nof different things could occur, and that connection is\nwhat makes this statute make sense.\nAnd I believe that the government basically\nacknowledges that in their brief, that there has to be\n-- if there's not some connection -- I think it's page\n29 of the government's brief. When we discussed the\nabsurd results that might flow from a statute where\nthere is no such connection, what the government says --\nI believe it's on page 29 -- is that to avoid these\nabsurd results, this connection does exist. But then\nthe next sentence they say: But it doesn't mean there\nis a mens rea.\nAnd it seems to me that what the government\nwants in that case is the \"during and relation to \"has\nto apply to discharge to avoid the absurd results, but\nyet they don't want Smith to go along with it. And\nSmith said that during and relation to is purposeful,\nhas to have an effect, and it can't be done by accident.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How would -- how would a\ndischarge not be during and in relation to? Give me an\nexample of -- of what you're worried about.\nMR. FORSTER: Any discharge any other time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He sees a duck fly by the\nwindow and he's a hunter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- excuse me.\nThat's not -- that's not covered. Number 3 only applies\nto someone who has already been guilty of what's set\nforth in the prologue.\nMR. FORSTER: That's the connection that we\nbelieve is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the only\nconnection that's necessary. You have to have done what\nwas set forth in the prologue, and it has -- has to be\nin the course of doing that. But \"the course of doing\nthat\" means just in the course of using a firearm in\nconnection with the bank robbery.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I don't think\nthat's the -- the best way to read it. I think it has\nto be during and in relation to the bank robbery.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the \"use or carry\"\ncertainly has to be in relation -- during and in\nrelation to, but that's step one. So he already is\nusing and carrying or carrying in relation to the bank\nrobbery. And then -- so that's the starting premise.\nThat excludes all your things about years before or\nyears after he carried -- he carried a gun. You -- step\none narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun\nin connection with a bank robbery.\nMR. FORSTER: And -- and I would agree with\nthat, and then when you take this Court's authority in\nSmith to say that that type use during and in relation\nto cannot be accidental. And so I go back to the\noriginal question Your Honor asked me, did he\nintentionally brandish it? Clearly. And so we believe\nthat if -- if this case we are here about is fit into\nSmith, he's on the hook for the seven years under\nbrandish, but because the discharge was accidental, it\ncannot constitute use under this Court's authority in\nSmith.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a question\nabout that. I thought that \"or possesses\" was separate\nfrom the \"uses or carries.\" Is possession an example of\nusing or carrying or is it as it says -- \"or who in\nfurtherance of such crime possesses\"? Is that a\nseparate -- separate enhancement?\nMR. FORSTER: I don't know that I would use\nthe word \"enhancement,\" Your Honor. The principal body\nof 924 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. FORSTER: -- \"carries\" with \"uses\" as in\nthis case as well as later on in the statute\n\"possesses.\" So it says both.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But merely possessing is\nenough to get the first enhancement of five years.\nMR. FORSTER: If it is in furtherance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or relation to.\nMR. FORSTER: If it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The \"uses or carries\"\ndoesn't -- doesn't necessarily apply to the possession.\nMR. FORSTER: The -- I believe, under the\nreading of the statute, Your Honor, they're separate.\nHe could have been charged arguably with possession --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. FORSTER: -- in furtherance of, but he\nwasn't. He was charged with using during and in\nrelation to the underlying crime of violence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we have to find that\nthe phrase \"if a firearm is brandished\" and the later\nphrase \"if a firearm is discharged\" require intentional\nbrandishing and intentional discharging? Why can't we\nlimit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the\nfirearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon\nor if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite\nundetermined whether it has to be intentionally\ndischarged, or even intentionally brandished for that\nmatter.\nMR. FORSTER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The definition of\nbrandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put\nanother person in fear.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, I think that you\nwould then have to turn to this Court's -- well, first\nof all, I think it's the best reading of the statute.\nIt doesn't make sense any other way to say that you can\nhave the gun discharged but not be during and in\nrelation to the underlying crime of violence. It\ndoesn't make sense.\nSecond, I believe that this Court's\nstatutory rules of construction would say that if\nCongress wanted to do away with the mens rea element in\nthis case, they would have had to have done so\nexpressly. And we don't believe that they did.\nNow, every circuit that has discussed the\nrequirement \"during and in relation to\" has found a\nknowledge requirement that you can't not know the gun is\nthere, for example. There has to be the knowledge\nrequirement. And this Court's authority in Smith\nsuggests or says clearly that it cannot be used\naccidentally.\nSo now the question becomes this: If the\nCourt decides that during -- that the discharge must be\nduring and in relation to, and when the Court does that\nit takes its own authority in Smith to say that it has\nto be purposeful, it has to have the effect of the\ncommission of the crime, now is -- would the use in this\ncase be subject to Smith? And Smith is clear that\naccidental discharge simply -- or accidental use, rather\n-- it didn't talk about discharge exactly -- but that\naccidental use would never be because it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- you say that this\nbackground -- that there has to be a state of mind\nelement. And we can accept that that's a general\nprinciple, but here we have a provision that does\nrequire a state of mind -- specifically requires a state\nof mind for the possession, for the brandishing, intent\nto intimidate, but here is this other one that suddenly\ndoesn't. So wouldn't the text of this statute say --\nthe third one, discharging a gun, they didn't mean to\nhave any element because -- any element of mens rea --\nbecause they had it in number 1 and 2, and 3 leaves it\nout.\nMR. FORSTER: Your Honor, if -- I believe\nsuch an interpretation would basically mean that that\nsilence would be interpreted as a strict liability, that\nsilence with regards to the specific intent requirement\nwould mean the Congress meant that no intent was\nnecessary. And that's simply never what these cases\nfrom this Court have held. There's the presumption that\nCongress operates against, and if they wish to eliminate\nthe mens rea element, they must do so expressly. And we\nsimply do not believe that it -- that it happened in\nthis case.\nOne last point is, we believe there's\nnothing else that Congress would have had to have done\nto establish a general intent, and if that's true, then\nI think the very least that could be said about our\ninterpretation is that it would be a reasonable one, in\nwhich case lenity principles would then come into play.\nMr. Chief Justice, if there's no other\nquestions I would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FORSTER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBy its terms, the sentencing factor in\nsection 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no mens rea\nrequirement. Rather, it requires a certain fact to be\npresent in the course of the section 924(c) offense,\nnamely that the firearm is discharged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it require that the\ndischarge be during and in relation to the crime? I\nmean, suppose the bank robber, you know, he sees -- son\nof a gun, he sees among the customers a man that ran off\nwith his wife a year ago, and he is just overcome with\nanger, and he -- you know, he takes a shot at this guy.\nIt's not in relation to the bank robbery. Would --\nwould that discharge be covered?\nMS. MAYNARD: As long as the discharge\noccurs while the 924(c) offense is going on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- yes, Justice Scalia, it\nwould -- it would apply. The \"during and in relation\nto\" language from the principal paragraph is part of the\noffense, but it does not carry down to the separate\nsentencing factors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\npolice come in and say, \"Drop it\"; he says, \"Oh, my\nrobbery's over\"; he drops it, and it goes off?\nMS. MAYNARD: That case might present a\nquestion about whether or not, once he drops it in\ncompliance with a lawful order to do so, he is still\ncommitting the section 924(c) offense. If the section\n924(c) offense is deemed to be over at that point, then,\nno, the firearm would not -- the fact would not have\nbeen present while the course of the section 924(c) --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's the line\nbetween is it going on. But assuming the offense is --\nthe bank robbery is still going on, like he's got\nconfederates gathering up the money or something, does\nthat fall under your theory that the gun is discharged?\nMS. MAYNARD: In our -- under our theory,\nthe -- there must be a temporal connection between the\noffense for which the defendant is being sentenced,\nwhich is a section 924(c) offense, the using or carrying\nthe firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery\nin your hypothetical or possessing it in furtherance of\nthe bank robbery in your hypothetical.\nIf one concluded that because the bank\nrobbery continued, even though he was no longer using or\ncarrying the firearm or no longer possessing it, that\nthe 924(c) offense also continued, and the firearm\ndischarges when he drops it, then, yes, the firearm is\ndischarged while the section 924(c) offense is ongoing,\nand, yes, the mandatory minimum would apply.\nBut -- but that hypothetical presents\nquestions about the beginning and end of the section\n924(c) itself, not questions about whether or not the\ndischarge was intentional or accidental.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that --\nregardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do\nyou think he has to discharge it or that he has to\nbrandish it? It is the passive voice. Does it mean if\nanybody discharges it or brandishes it?\nMS. MAYNARD: Two -- at least two points\nabout that, Your Honor. The passive voice makes clear\nthat Congress cared about the fact of the discharge,\nthat Congress was indifferent as to who discharged the\nweapon. Because the \"is brandished\" is also stated in\nthe passive voice, we think Congress was also\nindifferent as to who brandished the firearm, although\nthere is a separate provision giving content to what it\nmeans to brandish, and brandish must be done in order to\nintimidate. So -- but if a confederate, for example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Grabs it out of his hand\nand brandishes it.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- and brandishes in order to\nintimidate the victims in the bank, then yes, both of\nthem would be subject to the brand -- to the brandishing\nenhancement. And even if one thought that the language\nin the -- in the sentencing factor, \"if the firearm is\ndischarged,\" applied only to the defendant's conduct,\nwhich -- that's not our position, and we think that\nclearly -- it clearly encompasses others -- ordinary\nliability rules under Pinkerton and aiding and abetting\nprinciples would hold a confederate liable for discharge\nby another.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if the\npolice officer -- the police officer disarms the robber\nand ten minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes\noff.\nMS. MAYNARD: Again, I think that would\npresent questions about whether or not the section\n924(c) offense was still continuing, if the law\nenforcement officer has the weapon.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, assuming it\nis. I mean, he has got the one guy neutralized but the\nothers are still, you know, under the teller's window,\nand that isn't over. So then the guy who is captured\nalready gets an extra three years because the officer\nmishandled the gun?\nMS. MAYNARD: If the section 924(c) offense\nis -- is -- is ongoing and if the firearm is discharged,\nthe mandatory minimum sentence applies. One might\nconclude that if third parties take the weapon and\ndischarge it -- and, by the way, I do believe these are\npurely hypotheticals. They point to no case where\nthat's actually been the case -- but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there probably\naren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such\nklutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes\noff, either.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true, there may not be\nvery many accidental discharges. But there's no reason\nto believe Congress wanted courts to engage in the\ninquiry about whether or not the defendant accidentally\ndischarged the weapon. If this Court were to her -- to\nhold that accident -- accidental discharges are not\ncovered by the sentencing factor, I think that we would\nsee more claims of accidental discharge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I interrupted your\nanswer.\nMS. MAYNARD: About the third -- if one is\nconcerned about the actions of third parties who are not\nconfederates in any way taking the weapon -- and we do\nbelieve it does under the statute's language need to be\nthe firearm that is the basis of the section 924(c)\noffense, and not someone else's firearm. But if -- if\n-- in other words, not the security guard's firearm. If\nthe firearm is discharged by third party causes you\nconcern, one could conclude that that is not the manner\nin which the defendant committed the offense; and that\nthis Court's decision in Harris described this type of\nsentencing factor, these very sentencing factors, as the\nkind of factor that one looks at: Is a fact present in\nthe manner in which the defendant committed the offense?\nAnd so one might conclude that if the law\nenforcement officer disarms the robber and then later\ndischarges the weapon, that that fact of a discharge is\nnot part of the manner in which the defendant committed\nthe offense. We don't think that's compelled, by the\nway.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be the same --\nyou would give the same answer if the teller grabbed the\ngun from the robber and it went off?\nMS. MAYNARD: If the teller grabs the gun\nfrom the robber and it discharges, as long as the\nsection 924(c) offense is continuing, then the firearm\nis discharged.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your alternate\nposition would apply to the teller as well as the police\nofficer?\nMS. MAYNARD: One could reasonably conclude\nthat if the teller discharges it, it is in fact the\nmanner in which the defendant committed the offense.\nBut I do think there's reason to believe Congress may\nhave been concerned about the fact of the discharge by\nanyone. I mean, what you're talking about is someone\nwho's engaging in inherently dangerous activity. They\nbrought an armed weapon to commit a crime of violence or\na drug trafficking crime, and they've handled it in such\na way that either it is discharged --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is another --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't really have to\ndecide all this stuff, do we? We just have to decide\nwhether if he discharges it the discharge has to be\nintentional.\nMS. MAYNARD: There is no question here,\nYour Honor, but that it was the robber that discharged\nthe weapon. And in fact the Petitioner testified that:\n\"I pulled the trigger when I was switching the gun from\none hand to the other.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's also uncontested\nit was accidental, I think.\nMS. MAYNARD: We have not challenged that it\nwas accidental. But I think that it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you say to your\nopponent's argument -- I don't know if it's right or not\n-- but that there's sort of a background rule that\ngenerally we assume when Congress prohibits conduct, it\nmeans intentional conduct; and normally if they don't\nmean that, they make it rather clear in the statute.\nIs that a correct -- is his background\nprinciple correct?\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Justice\nStevens, with respect to sentencing factors. I think\nthere's no case in which this Court has indicated -- and\nno common law principles --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What's the difference\nbetween a sentencing factor that adds five years to a\nsentence and an element of the crime? There are a lot\nof us that think that -- you've read Harris and\nApprendi. You know there is some debate about whether\nthat really makes all that much difference.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, in Harris, which was --\nin which this Court was interpreting these very\nsentencing factors here, the Court note -- noted that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me -- let me rephrase\nthe question.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it were an element of\nthe crime, would you then agree with his background\nrule?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, because if it\nwere an element --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then the fact that the\nsentencing factor is an element really isn't\nsignificant.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think it might be a harder\ncase for us if it were an element of the crime, but it\nwouldn't be an element that would be necessary.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why would it be a\nharder case for you?\nMS. MAYNARD: Why would it be a harder case\nfor us? Because if it were a harbor -- hard -- if it\nwere an element of the crime, then it would be an\naggravated offense, and then one could debate whether or\nnot the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in that situation\nwould there be a background rule that we normally think\nCongress intends to punish intentional conduct?\nMS. MAYNARD: I think there is a background\nrule with respect to the definition of criminal offenses\nthat Congress intends some mens rea.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you really then are\nrelying on the difference between an element of the\ncrime and a sentencing factor?\nMS. MAYNARD: Not -- no, Your Honor, not in\nthis way, because it -- it would -- it would be a more\ndifficult caper -- case for us, I can see, but that you\nwould still be talking about somebody who was engaged in\nwrongful conduct. There would be no danger.\nI mean, one of the reasons the Court assumes\na mens rea requirement or reads in a mens rea\nrequirement when one's not there, is because of the fear\nof capturing innocent conduct; but what you would be\ntalking about is someone who has taken a loaded weapon\nto commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking\ncrime and used it during in relation to that crime or to\npossess it in furtherance of that crime, and is already\nguilty. They are engaged in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's entirely\nfortuitous; you have two bank robbers, they both do\nexactly the same thing, in one case the gun goes off and\nthe other it doesn't. Does that -- does it seem -- does\nit seem fair to add three years onto the sentence of the\none whose gun happens to go off but not on the sentence\nof the one whose doesn't?\nMS. MAYNARD: They both engaged in\ninherently dangerous activity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they both did.\nThat's my point, they both did exactly the same thing.\nMS. MAYNARD: And it's common in criminal\nlaw to hold criminals responsible for their unintended\nconsequences of their criminal acts, and that's -- in\nyour hypothetical it wouldn't be unusual at all to hold\nsomeone liable for the accidental discharge when they've\ntaken a loaded weapon to commit a violent crime, here a\nbank robbery, and handled it in such a way that it goes\noff. It's completely reasonable for Congress to\nconclude --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You get three extra\nyears for having bad luck?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, no, well they're -- just\nto be clear, they're both subject to life imprisonment\nfor taking the gun and committing -- and using it to\ncommit the bank robbery. So it's not tacking on three\nyears; it's increasing the minimum; and that is a\nsignificant difference, Justice Stevens that this Court\nhas recognized with respect to these various factors in\nHarris itself, that the -- whether or not there was a\ndischarge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is this guy\nlikely to get life for a bank robbery, the gun\naccidentally goes off? I don't know whether it's his\nfirst offense or not.\nMS. MAYNARD: As a practical matter, no,\nYour Honor. However, had the accidental discharge\ncaused a death, then he would have committed a more\nserious offense, and that may have been the penalty.\nBut the point is that one is often subject to higher\npenalties than one might have expected by the unintended\nconsequences of one's criminal act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What would you think -- to\ngo back to Justice Stevens' question, I would start with\nthe assumption that, normally, not always, where you\nhave a criminal statute and the crime has elements, that\nCongress intends that the elements be carried out with a\nguilty state of mind; I would start with that\nassumption.\nNow I would agree with you that sentencing\nis different, and the reason that it's different is\nbecause sentencing often goes up or down depending upon\nwhether the harm that is foreseen does or does not\noccur, irrespective of the state of mind. So we\ncouldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think that's correct, Your\nHonor, and that's our view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, having done\nthat I wonder if the background rule should come into\nplay once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at\nstake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there\nare many ways in which the sentence will go up. If this\nperson had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder\nin the course of a felony. There are all kinds of other\nstatutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't\napply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give\nhim the higher sentence, if he warrants it.\nBut if you apply the mandatory minimum where\nthe judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to\ntake people who the judge and others think fall into the\nminimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and\nforce them to have a higher sentence. Now, that would\nbe a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum\nsentencing matters.\nMS. MAYNARD: But that would be a\nreconceptualization of the rule of lenity, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it would. It would.\nMS. MAYNARD: And what, it would be a -- as\nyou said for this Court, in Muscarello, the rule of\nlenity has never been a rule where the defendant always\nprevails; and it would be an odd notion to have a more\nmuscular rule of the rule of lenity in the sentencing\nenhancement context than you have with respect to the\ncrime itself.\nThe whole point of having the mandatory\nminimum is to take away discretion from judges. What --\nand the language of the statute here in our view is\nclear. It says \"if the firearm is discharged,\" and I\nthink it's the present tense that gets you the -- the\ntemporal connection to the crime here. If it is\ndischarged while you are using or carrying it or\npossessing it, in the offense in the principal\nparagraph, Congress wanted you to have ten years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I can't -- I can't --\nthe trouble is I can't find anything in the history of\nthis that really says why they use \"is discharged\" or\nused \"as opposed to discharges.\" And I find those very\nmetaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see\neither something in the history or some functional\nconsideration.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, in the blue brief they\nlay out the House's final version, and we have the\nHouse's final version in one of our footnotes. And then\nthey lay out the Senate's final version.\nAnd one important distinction, Justice\nBreyer, between those two versions is that the House's\nversion would have made it active voice, but not only\nactive. But it would have been amenable to the argument\nthat during and in relation to -- discharges, because\nit's structured different.\nBut the House would have set the penalty for\na discharge at 20 years. Okay. That's -- you can infer\nfrom that that the House thought an intentional\ndischarge should subject you to 20 years.\nThe Senate's version, which put it in the\npassive voice, said if the firearm is discharged and set\na mandatory minimum of 10 years. And I think you can\ninfer from that, Justice Breyer, the -- the current\nstructure allows what you're positing, which is more\nculpable defendants who intend to discharge the firearm\nto receive a higher sentence. And one could infer, I\nthink, that the House thinks that should be 20 years.\nSo I think the -- the current structure does\nallow judges to take into consideration. It just sets\nthe floor. And Congress is entitled to do that, and I\nthink they have clearly done that and then to take out\nof the realm of debate whether or not the defendant\nintended to discharge the firearm or didn't mean to\ndischarge the firearm.\nI would like to -- to say one factual point,\nwhich is in the -- in the indictment Petitioner actually\nwas charged with use or carrying. It just seems -- if I\ncould explain, the \"use or carry during or in relation\nto,\" is one prong, one way in which to commit the\nprincipal offense.\n\"Possessing in furtherance\" is another way\nto commit the principal offense. The \"use or carry\" is\nnot modified by \"possession in furtherance of,\" and\n\"possess\" is not modified by -- by \"during or in\nrelation to,\" which is another reason it makes no sense\nto -- to trail the \"during or in relation to\" down to\nthe generally applicable sentencing factors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a difference, a\npractical difference, between the two formulations?\nMS. MAYNARD: The legislative -- well, the\nwords are actually different; the text is different; and\nthe legislative history suggests that Congress wanted a\nbeefed-up \"in relation to\" requirement for possession in\norder to make sure that incidental possession during --\nyou know, incidental possession while one is also\ncommitting a crime wasn't captured. So the \"in\nfurtherance of\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What you're saying, to\nmake sure I understand, is that the \"in relation to\"\nlanguage modifies both \"use\" and \"possession\"?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, sir. The \"in relation to\"\n-- the \"during or in relation to\" modifier modifies only\n\"use or carry.\" And if one is charged with a \"use or\ncarry\" offense, then the government must show that you\n\"used or carried during or in relation to\" in the way\nthose words have been given meaning by this Court.\nIf you're charged with possession, the\ngovernment must show that you possessed the firearm in\nfurtherance of. Now, the -- the \"in furtherance of\" and\nthe \"in relation to\" prong have been given similar\nmeanings by the courts, although generally it's thought\nthat the \"in furtherance of,\" like I say, is a sort of\nbeefed up \"in relation to\" requirement because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Carries,\" what about\n\"carries\"? If a person is carrying the gun in his\npocket but he doesn't know it, which could happen, does\nthat fall within \"carries\" or not?\nMS. MAYNARD: He would be carrying, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is he guilty of the\nfirst; do we know?\nMS. MAYNARD: He would be carrying -- if I\nunderstood you, he would be carrying. And if he was\nalso committing a crime, he would be carrying -- if he\nwas also committing a crime of violence, he would be\ncarrying it during the crime of violence. But under\nthis Court's decision in Smith, if it were --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The carrying has to be --\nalthough the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the\ncarrying has to be in relation to the crime.\nMS. MAYNARD: The statute does say that\ncarrying has to be in relation to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it just said \"who\nin furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: I am sorry. I thought you\nwere asking me a \"carry\" hypothetical. If you are\nasking me a \"possession\" hypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it's a \"carrying.\" My\n-- my interest is the -- whoever, blah, blah, blah, for\nwhich the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a\nfirearm, or who in furtherance of any such crime\npossesses a firearm. So I thought that the \"in\nfurtherance\" does not modify \"carry\".\nMS. MAYNARD: It doesn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: You are right. Okay. I am\nsorry. I answered --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, you know, what happens\nif the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the\nfirearm in his pocket and doesn't know it? He picked it\nup from the tailor, and now is -- is there an intent\nrequirement there? Do we know? Did Smith talk about\nthat? Do we know? I mean is there, you know, a state\nof mind requirement?\nMS. MAYNARD: It's hard to see how one could\nmeet this Court's definition in Smith for -- for \"in\nrelation to,\" which was to have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Smith says \"in relation to\"\nand so the carrying has to be in relation to. And since\nthe carrying has to be in relation to, that pretty much\n--\nMS. MAYNARD: The underlying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- covers the state of\nmind.\nMS. MAYNARD: The carrying had to be in\nrelation to the underlying drug crime or crime of\nviolence. This Court gave content to \"in relation to\"\nin Smith to mean have some purpose or effect, facilitate\nor further the underlying crime, not be by accident or\ncoincidence.\nThe gist of Petitioner's argument here is\nthey want to read that \"accident or coincidence\"\nlanguage down to modify \"discharge.\" And structurally\nthat -- that just doesn't work. And if -- if I can make\none more point about why it's clear it isn't that, which\nis that the -- the \"in possession in furtherance of\nrequirement\" -- I mean one of the things they say in\nresponse to our argument is that we are willing to put a\ntemporal limitation on the sentencing factors, but not\nan \"in relation to\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just make sure I\nunderstand your position? \"During and in relation to\"\nmodifies the first words it follows. \"In furtherance\nto\" modifies \"possession.\" Now, do either \"in relation\nto\" or \"in furtherance\" to it modify the three\nsubsequent subparagraphs?\nMS. MAYNARD: Definitely not, no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So neither of them\napplies. So it doesn't have to be \"in furtherance of\"\nor \"in relation to\"?\nMS. MAYNARD: The -- the sentencing factors\nare set out separately. And you don't get to them --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: None of the sentencing\nfactors require that that factor be in -- either in\nrelation to the crime or in furtherance of the crime?\nIt could be just walking down the street, you happen to\nhave a gun?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, you have to be guilty of\nthe principal offense, Justice Stevens, before you get\nto sentencing factors. So you have to have either --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Sentencing factors need\nnot be in relation to the crime nor in furtherance of\nthe crime.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right. The definitive --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be during the\ncrime.\nMS. MAYNARD: It has to be during and -- but\nthere -- but it's not because the word \"during\" appears\nin the principal offense, which is how they would have\nour argument be. The -- the -- it has to -- the\nsentencing factor has to occur. First you have to\ncommit the principal -- let me just back up. You have\nto commit the principal offense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why does it have to be\n\"during\"? It -- it doesn't in the statute?\nMS. MAYNARD: It has to be \"during\" for\nthree reasons. One, the -- the language of the\nsentencing factor says if the firearm is discharged.\nIt's in the present tense. So the present tense of the\n\"is discharged\" language -- it has to be while you're\nusing, carrying -- \"uses, carries, or possesses\" is also\nin the act.\nThe \"is discharged\" has to happen while\nyou're using, carrying, or possessing. That takes out\nhypotheticals about, well, it was discharged at the\nfactory before I got it, and law enforcement discharged\nit well after they took it from me to test the\nballistics on it. Those aren't covered because it's not\n\"is discharged\" while you're using, carrying or\npossessing.\nSecondly, this Court in Harris recognized\nthat these are the types of sentencing factors that one\nconsiders when deciding whether a certain fact is\npresent in the manner in which an offense is committed.\nSo the fact has to be present in the commission of the\noffense. That's just the way this type of sentencing\nfactor operates, and the courts so interpreted these\nparticular sentencing factors in Harris.\nAnd we know that it's not because of the\n\"during\" in the principal paragraph, Justice Stevens,\nbecause there is no \"during\" element to the \"possession\"\nprong. Nevertheless, the sentencing factors apply to\nthat prong, and we would apply temporal in cases that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There is an \"in\nfurtherance.\" There is an \"in furtherance of the\ncrime.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor, and if you\npossess a firearm --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I want to make sure I\nunderstand. You are saying it need not be \"during\" or\n-- you said it has to be \"during\" but not because the\nstatute includes the word \"during.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what does -- where\ndoes the \"during\" come from then?\nMS. MAYNARD: The \"during\" comes from the\nfact that the sentencing factor is in the present tense,\nand says \"is discharged.\" That means that the \"is\ndischarged\" must occur while the offense is -- is\noccurring. So the temporal limitation comes from, and\nis from, the nature of these types of sentencing\nfactors, which ask: Is this factor present? That's\nwhat Congress cared about.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say it can't come\nfrom the prologue, because if it came from the prologue,\nit wouldn't apply to the mere possession.\nMS. MAYNARD: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the possession could be\nat any time, before the crime, after the crime,\nwhatever.\nMS. MAYNARD: Possession -- it would just\nhave to be possession that was in furtherance of an\nunderlying crime. Once you're guilty of that, if the\nfirearm was discharged while you were guilty of that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to import some\n-- some contemporaneous -- contemporaneous requirement\ninto the 1, 2, and 3.\nMS. MAYNARD: Some temporal limitation, and\nthe limitation is what -- is that it must be discharged\nwhile you're committing the offense for which you're\nbeing sentenced when we're looking at sentencing\nfactors, which is set forth in 924(c).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's committed when\nthe guy is trying to escape, and the gun goes off\naccidentally? Is that in -- I mean is that during the\ncrime?\nMS. MAYNARD: Again, it would turn on -- on\n-- it wouldn't turn on whether accidental or intentional\ndischarge, Justice Stevens. That would present a\ndifficult hypothetical about whether or not the 924(c)\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Two hours later when he got\nhome -- he carried the gun in -- IN furtherance of the\ncrime. He still had it with him all the way through,\nand the gun went off after he left the bank.\nMS. MAYNARD: If -- if it were determined\nthat the -- the 924(c) offense, which is the possession\nin furtherance of crime, were still going on at that\npoint -- in other words he was still possessing it in\nfurtherance of the underlying crime of violence, and it\ndischarges -- then, yes, the sentencing factor, by its\nplain terms, applies.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then you're telling me\nthat it need not be during as long as it's in\nfurtherance of. So the \"in furtherance of\" is also\nincorporated implicitly in the sentencing factors.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the -- no, the \"in\nfurtherance of,\" it -- the inquiry we would be making at\nsentencing, Justice Stevens, is not was the discharge in\nfurtherance of. You would -- you would -- all you would\nbe asking is, were you still possessing the firearm in\nfurtherance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This must be during?\nMS. MAYNARD: The discharge must be\ntemporally related to the principal offense, yes,\nbecause the discharge is discharged while you're in the\ncourse of the principal offense, that's the way these\ntypes of sentencing factors --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think I got everybody\nmixed up, because the first sentence of the statute is\non the preceding page. And if I start at the beginning,\nI would discover -- of my memo -- if -- it says, if --\nin -- who -- any person who during and in relation --\nduring and in relation to any crime of violence or drug\ntrafficking crime, blah, blah, blah, of a certain kind\nuses or carries a firearm.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there it is right there,\nor who in furtherance of such a crime possesses shall be\nsentenced. Okay. So we've got the during and in\nrelation to covering the whole bunch. Then we have to\nread that into little (ii) and little (iii).\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I mean, just\nto make sure I understand what you're say. The \"during\nand in relation to\" only modifies the verb \"uses or\ncarries\"?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, exactly.\nMS. MAYNARD: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then we have to read that\nby implication where it says if the firearm is\nbrandished during or -- you have to imply that.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's their argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, that's not your\nargument?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Forget it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not your argument\nbecause if that was the only -- if that was the source\nof the contemporaneous requirement, there would be no\ncontemporaneous requirement for the in furtherance?\nMS. MAYNARD: That's right. And also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The provision -- the in\nfurtherance provision.\nMS. MAYNARD: The reason we don't believe\nthat's the correct reading is because, as this Court\nindicated in Harris, the principal offense -- the\nprincipal paragraph sets forth the complete crime, and\nit ends with \"shall.\" So once you do the things in the\nprincipals for crime, you're guilty. And then the only\nquestion is, what shall your sentence be?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, some of\nthese difficult hypotheticals such as the one that\nJustice Stevens put about the gun going off while the --\nwhile the individual is escaping, that's going to be a\nproblem whether you adopt your interpretation or the --\nor the petitioner's interpretation, even if you assume\nthat it has to be during and in relation to it's still\ngoing to be a problem. Is this -- is this during and in\nrelation to the crime.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, just to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it occurs, you know,\nfive hours later while he's escaping, I don't know.\nMS. MAYNARD: Just to be clear about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to decide\nthat.\nMS. MAYNARD: It wouldn't have anything to\ndo with whether it intentionally goes off, Justice\nStevens. Your hypothetical could still raise a\nquestion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The strange thing about\nthis case is we're talking about a category of crimes in\nwhich somebody person mistakenly fires the gun, that\ndoesn't happen very often. The whole -- the whole\ndispute is about really a trivial set of crimes.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think it's important\nto recognize, though, that Congress didn't want to open\nthe door to claims that -- that the firearm was\ndischarged accidentally.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Sure, when the\ndefendant -- and says I didn't really mean to shoot the\nguy?\nMS. MAYNARD: Right. I mean, the -- the\nfact of a discharge is what Congress is clearly\nconcerned about, and you can tell that from the text.\nWhat it did want to say is that in the indictment here\nhe was actually charged with uses, carries, and\npossesses. The indictment is not perfectly worded. It\nonly has the \"during and in relation to,\" and it -- but\nthe -- the instructions were proper and there were no --\nthe jury instructions in trial were proper and there\nwere no objection to the instructions, but I did want to\ncorrect one point about that.\nAnd if there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nFour minutes, Mr. Forster.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FORSTER: This Court in U.S. Gypsum was\nvery clear when it said that far more than the simple\nomission of the appropriate phrase of a statutory\ndefinition is necessary to justify dispensing with the\nintent requirement.\nAnd our argument is simply this, merely\nbecause this might be a sentencing enhancement rather\nthan an element of the offense, this Court never says\nthat the normal rules of statutory construction cease to\napply under those circumstances, which means that the\nmens rea presumption is appropriate in this case, and\njust like this Court said in the passage I just cited.\nIf Congress wants to dispense with that\nrequirement, they must do so clearly, and they simply\ndid not do that in this case. If they wanted to do\nthat, they could insert the words \"intentionally\" or\n\"unintentionally discharge,\" in which case that would be\nclear. And that simply is not the way this statute\nreads.\nThe best reading of the statute, I believe,\nand this is what Your Honor was headed toward, is to\nread the discharge to require during and in relation to.\nI just think that's the best --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that helping? I mean,\nthis did take place during, and you would have thought\nwhen something goes off accidentally it's in relation\nto. I mean, you know, I can imagine an argument to the\ncontrary, but it isn't obvious. It just is --\nMR. FORSTER: But, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They have during, in\nrelation to and in furtherance of, so their in\nfurtherance of doesn't carry over. The first two do.\nAn accidental discharge is it not in relation to the\ncrime?\nMR. FORSTER: Not under this Court's\nauthority in Smith. I think Smith is clear, the purpose\nand effect and not be used by accident.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What was the case you\ncited when you started your rebuttal?\nMR. FORSTER: U.S. Gypsum.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that the antitrust\ncase? You caught me by surprise.\nMR. FORSTER: I believe it is. I believe it\nis, Your Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, if there are no other\nquestions, I thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\nthe case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m.,
