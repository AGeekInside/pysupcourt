        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-9335, Alleyne v. United\nStates.\nMs. Maguire?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY E. MAGUIRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MAGUIRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about who gets to decide the\nfacts that trigger a mandatory minimum sentence. Any\nfact that entitles a prosecution by law to a sentence\nmore severe than a judge could otherwise impose must be\nfound by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\nUnder Harris, the government is entitled --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could you\naddress an issue that's very important to me, the one of\nstare decisis. And so that -- hone in on that.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. I do\nnot believe that stare decisis poses a problem for the\nCourt in this case because Harris was a plurality\nopinion. And while four of the Justices found that --\nI'm sorry, five of the Justices voted to uphold\nMcMillan, only four of the Justices found that McMillan\nwas consistent with Apprendi.\nAnd so we have a plurality opinion, and, for\nour constitutional position, we do not believe that\nHarris --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the problem is,\nwhether you're right or wrong -- and you're absolutely\nright, it was a plurality opinion -- your adversary says\nStates have passed laws relying on it, the Federal\nsystem is now structured around it, why isn't the damage\nas great as they claim -- potential damage, I should\nsay.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, first of all, I would\njust note that, even though McMillan was decided in\n1986, there is nothing in the legislative history that\nindicates that Congress referred on McMillan when it\npassed 924(c).\nIn addition, 924(c) is silent as to who\nshould be the fact-finder that triggers the mandatory\nminimum. And, finally, in the McMillan case, that was\nnot really a Sixth Amendment case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Address, please, the\npractical consequences.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Certainly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many -- how many\nFederal courts are you aware are already charging the\n924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact\nthat it's not required?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Yes, I -- I would say that\nthere is little to no practical effect, if the Court is\nto adopt a rule, because the majority of the Federal\ncourts are already -- and Federal prosecutors are\nalready -- alleging these facts in the indictment and\nproving them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. And I\nthink that this case is the exact example of that.\nIt was alleged in the indictment. It went\nto the jury, the jury got a special verdict form, so\nthere is no difficulty in implementing this rule --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't your position that\na decision of this Court is not entitled to stare\ndecisis protection, if there isn't a majority opinion in\nthat case?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Yes, Your Honor. I do not\nbelieve that Harris has precedential value because it is\na plurality opinion. In our --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I can think of some\npretty important decisions of this Court that were not\nthe result of a majority opinion. Do you want us to\nadopt that as a blanket rule?\nMS. MAGUIRE: No, Your Honor, but I would\nnote that, in constitutional questions like this one,\nstare decisis is at its weakness -- weakest. I would\nalso --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Constitutional\ndecisions of this Court not decided with the majority\nopinion, no stare decisis effect. That's your argument?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, and also, Your Honor,\nwhat I think is significant in this case, in terms of\nthe issue of stare decisis, is that McMillan was not a\nSixth Amendment case. McMillan was decided more on due\nprocess grounds. And the only discussion of the Sixth\nAmendment in McMillan comes in the last paragraph, when\nit talks to the fact that the defendant has no right to\njury sentencing.\nAnd so, for those reasons, we do not believe\nthat stare decisis poses a problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't distinguished\nMcMillan. You've distinguished Harris. How do you\ndistinguish McMillan? Your -- your only grounds for\ndistinguishing that is it was not a\nSixth Amendment case, even though the opinion refers to\nthe Sixth Amendment?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, Your Honor, it does, in\nfact, refer to the Sixth Amendment in the very last\nparagraph. But what McMillan was mostly concerned about\nwas a due process claim --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care about\n\"mostly.\" The issue is whether McMillan was a\nSixth Amendment case, in part or in whole. And I don't\nknow how you can say it wasn't. We -- we don't decide\ncases on -- on what a case mostly says. We decide on\nwhat it says.\nMS. MAGUIRE: That's absolutely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Maguire, you don't --\nyou don't have to take the position that there's no\nstare decisis effect. In a unanimous -- a recent\nunanimous decision of this Court, obviously, would carry\nmore weight than one that has a plurality opinion, so\nyou don't have to say -- it isn't a question of yes or\nno, it's a question of the degree of respect that we\nwould give to our former decision.\nMS. MAGUIRE: I think that that is exactly\nright, Justice Ginsburg. And, in fact, the other\nfactors that the Court considers when looking at stare\ndecisis is what were the margins of vote on the previous\ncases, and McMillan was decided on a 5-4 decision,\nwhereas Harris, as we've noted, was a plurality\ndecision.\nBoth opinions were found over spirited\ndissents. They have been criticized by this Court and\nthe lower courts, and, in all of those instances, we\nbelieve that stare decisis is at its weakest --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think it's important\nfor this Court to have a consistent doctrine of stare\ndecisis. The doctrine can't be, \"We will overrule\ndecisions that we don't like, but we will stick with\ndecisions that the majority does like.\" So I'm still\nlooking for your understanding of what stare decisis\nmeans in constitutional cases.\nNow, with the suggestion of\nJustice Ginsburg, I gather that your position is, if\nit's a narrow decision, then it's -- stare decisis has\nless weight; is that it? Now, what other factors? So\nit has less weight. Why isn't it controlling, though?\nWhy does it have insufficient weight here?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Because, Justice Alito,\nanother thing that you look -- look to, when you are\nconsidering stare decisis, is whether or not the rule is\nworkable, whether or not the prior decision was badly\nreasoned, and those are other factors that the Court can\nconsider.\nAnd, if you look at this Court's Sixth\nAmendment jurisprudence, as it has developed since\nApprendi, then in Booker, then in Blakely, then in\nCunningham, what we are asking for today is a logical --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why is this not\nworkable? I mean, you can -- you can argue about\nwhether it was right or wrong. You can argue about\nwhether it has created some incongruity in the system.\nBut haven't the last number of years\nsuggested that it's perfectly workable? Everybody knows\nwhat they are supposed to do; everybody does it. Why --\nwhy is this not workable?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, the Harris rule is not\nworkable on a practical level because what happens under\nthe Harris rule is the government is entitled to a fact\nthat drives a more severe punishment that never goes to\nthe jury. If -- if -- and what we are asking here is\nthat the court find that, where there is a fact that\ntriggers a mandatory minimum, that that fact be found by\nthe jury.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now I understand --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds like --\nthat sounds like an argument that it's wrong, and that\nis, of course, the first step in -- in the stare decisis\nanalysis. It doesn't sound, to me, responsive to\nJustice Kagan's question is, in what sense is it\nunworkable?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, I think it becomes\nunworkable in the drug cases, Your Honor, and in the\n9841 statute because what you have there is you have, in\nsome circuits, people alleging drug weight, but, in\nother circuits, you have they called this mixing and\nmatching. And, as long as the statutory maximum does\nnot exceed 20 years, the prosecutors are not alleging\nthe drug weights in the indictment.\nAnd that becomes unworkable and quite\nconfusing to the courts. And the lower courts have\ncriticized the Harris rule, primarily in cases like\nKrieger and others that we -- are cited in our amicus\nbrief, that the rule is somewhat unworkable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that be a\nproblem if -- if the question had to be decided by the\njury? Why does -- why does requiring it to be decided\nby the jury eliminate that -- that problem of the -- of\nthe mixing or not mixing?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, asking it to be found by\na jury solves the problem because it -- it allows the\nfact to go to the jury, the jury finds it. And we have\na long history in this country that jury verdicts drive\npunishment. And so the idea is that the punishment that\nsomebody is open to should be driven by the jury\nverdict.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned drug\nweight. Let's -- so you're making -- your argument\nwould mean that drug weight also has to be found by the\njury because that can -- the length of the sentence can\ndepend on the -- the drug weight.\nMS. MAGUIRE: If the drug weight is going to\ntrigger a mandatory minimum, Your Honor, yes, we would\nsay that, under our rule, that that would have to be\nalleged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond\na reasonable doubt, which, as our amicus briefs point\nout, is being done already in the majority of circuits\nthroughout the country.\nAnd so this is not going to put -- put any\nadditional burden on the prosecutors to be doing this.\nAnd, fundamentally, what it does is that it levels the\nplaying field because what it does in trial situations\nis it allows a defendant to know exactly what it is that\nthe government is going to prove.\nThe government then has to bring in those\nwitnesses at the time of trial, so that they can be\ncross-examined on this fact that is going to trigger the\nmandatory minimum in their case. And so it helps level\nthe playing field in that regard.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, if you were defending a\ncase involving drug weight and your client maintained\nthat he or she had nothing to do with these drugs, how\nwould you proceed? Your argument would be: They're not\nmy drugs, but if they were my drugs, they weren't --\nthey didn't weigh more than one kilo.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, Justice Alito, those are\nstrategical questions that come up in every trial case\nthat we have. And you have to decide, as a trial\nlawyer, what your theory of the defense is going to be.\nIt's simply going to be, I wasn't there; or you may\ndecide to challenge the drug weight.\nBut those -- those strategic decisions exist\nwhether or not the Court adopts this rule or doesn't\nadopt the rule --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the question was\nwhat -- what strategic decision do you think the lawyer\nshould make?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, any strategic decision a\nlawyer makes is going to depend on the individual facts\nof the case. For example --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- but -- but\nJustice Alito has a real problem. What -- don't you put\nthe defense in a very difficult position?\nMS. MAGUIRE: You don't put the defense in a\nvery difficult position because, in fact, if you adopt\nour rule, we believe that you are protecting the\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury because this\nis a fact that is going to be triggering a mandatory\nminimum.\nAnd, if the government has to prove it, they\nthen have to bring in the witness to the trial, who is\nthen subject to cross-examination, which is a far\nmore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but isn't it\ndifficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the\ndrugs, plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain\namount?\nMS. MAGUIRE: I don't believe that that is\ndifficult, and I believe that those are decisions that\nyou make in every case. For example, in the case -- in\nthis case -- in Mr. Alleyne's case, our theory --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that I am hearing\nthat, in every case, you are going to want witnesses --\nyou are going to insist on a jury determination of the\namount. That's kind of what I'm hearing.\nMS. MAGUIRE: That is the rule,\nJustice Kennedy, that we are asking the Court to adopt,\nthat if there's a fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Alito says why\ndoesn't that put defense counsel in a very difficult\nposition?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, it doesn't put defense\ncounsel in a difficult position at all because those are\nthe same decisions that you make, whether or not you\nadopt this rule or you don't adopt this rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're not getting\nfar with this. But one answer you could say is that, in\norder to preserve the constitutional right, you want us\nto have a bifurcated trial. I thought you were -- might\nsay that.\nMS. MAGUIRE: No, we are not -- we are not\nasking for a bifurcated trial. We are just asking that\nif there's one --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's good because that's\nan extra problem.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Maguire, could I take\nyou to a different kind of question?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Certainly.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Let's assume that there were\na statute, and it said carrying a gun is an offense and\nthat the range is 5 to 10 years. I realize it goes up\nfurther in the real word, but let's just say 5 to 10\nyears. And Congress said, in setting the penalty within\nthat range, the judge shall consider whether the\ndefendant brandished the gun and whether the defendant\ndischarged the gun. Now -- and that's all the statute\nsaid.\nThat would be constitutional; is that not\nright?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Yes, Justice Kagan, that would\nbe constitutional because it doesn't have the mandatory\neffect.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So it's\nconstitutional for the judge to say, seven years because\nyou brandished, nine years because you discharged.\nSo what makes it unconstitutional, what\nmakes it a violation of the Sixth Amendment, when, now,\nCongress just provides something extra in the statute?\nIt says not just you shall consider brandishing and\ndischarging, but, if you find brandishing, you get 7; if\nyou find discharging, you get 9.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Okay. What makes that\nunconstitutional is because you are stripping the judge\nof all authority, and, by operation of law, you are\ntelling that judge that you must impose this sentence.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that seems right as a\ndefinitional matter, as a descriptive matter. But I\nguess the question I'm having difficulty with is why\ndoes that matter for purposes of the Sixth Amendment?\nThe jury is doing the exact same thing, which is the\njury isn't doing anything in either of my examples.\nSo the only difference between example\nnumber one, which you said was constitutional, and\nexample number two is that, now, Congress is giving\nfurther instruction to the judge, but nothing more is\nbeing taken away from the jury; is it?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, yes, it is because, in\nyour second hypothetical, where it is the mandatory\nminimum, which is exactly what we have in this case,\nthis notion that somehow Congress is channelling\ndiscretion is a fiction because what it does is it tells\nthe judge, you must impose seven years, and you cannot\neven consider what is authorized by the jury verdict in\nthis case.\nAnd the jury verdict in this case authorized\na range of five years as the bottom. And so what\nhappens is, when you have Congress coming in and saying\nthat, if you find this fact on a mere preponderance\nstandard, you must impose seven years, then you are\nstripping the defendant of the benefit of the full jury\nverdict in this case, which authorized a range that had\na lower floor than that called for by the Federal\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Maguire, could -- could\nyou repeat the first sentence you uttered in this\nargument? I -- I hesitated to jump in so early, but\ncould you repeat it verbatim? Maybe you had committed\nit to memory. Good -- good counsel often does that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAGUIRE: Thank you, Justice Scalia.\nIt's -- my very first sentence was, \"This case is about\nwho gets to decide the facts that trigger a mandatory\nminimum sentence.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, that wasn't it.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It started,\n\"Mr. Chief Justice.\"\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you said was\nwho has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be\nsubject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be\nsubject to? And the fact is that, in the case of a\nmandatory minimum, the defendant could have been given\nthat mandatory minimum. It was up to the judge.\nSo this mandatory minimum does not increase\nthe penalty to which the defendant is subject. He's\nsubject, in Justice Kagan's example, to any penalty\nbetween one years -- one year and 10. The judge, even\nwithout the statute that she mentioned, could have given\nhim seven years because he -- he brandished a gun.\nThere -- there is really no -- no increase in the\npenalty to which he is exposed.\nAnd I thought that is what Apprendi\naddressed, any increase in the penalty to which you are\nexposed, so that when you decide, I'm going to rob a\nbank -- you know -- you know, when you go in, you are\ngoing to get between one and 10 years, and, with a\nmandatory minimum, you get between one and 10 years.\nSo what's the complaint, as far as Apprendi\nis concerned?\nMS. MAGUIRE: The complaint is that -- and\nwhy we believe that the rule we are asking the Court to\nadopt, Justice Scalia, is a natural -- it follows the\nlogic of Apprendi, is because, in both cases, you have\njudicial factfinding that's leading to a more harsh\nsentence. In your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't leading to a more\nharsh -- more harsh sentence. That's the whole point of\nApprendi. Does it lead to a sentence which is greater\nthan the judge would otherwise be authorized to impose?\nAnd, in the case of a mandatory minimum, it never is.\nThe judge could impose that, if he was a hanging judge.\nYou know, you have some hanging judges; you have some\nbleeding heart judges.\nAnd -- and what a mandatory minimum simply\nsays is -- you know, we don't care what kind of a judge\nyou are, at least this much. But it doesn't expose the\ndefendant to any greater penalty. He's -- he's at risk\nbetween one and 10 years.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well -- and I think,\nJustice Scalia, that's -- that's a false presumption. I\nthink that's the position of the government, that,\nsomehow, mandatory minimums channel discretion within a\nrange. That is a fiction because a judge is being\ntold, you must impose this, you have no choice, you\ncannot go below this. That is the whole nature of a\nmandatory minimum. And so this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any\nstatistics, on at least 924(c), of how often the greater\nis the sentence than the absolute minimum required by\nlaw?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, Justice Sotomayor, this\nCourt found in O'Brien -- and I think that it's also\ncited in the Lucas briefs and Dorsey briefs that this\nCourt is holding, that the majority of all defendants\nconvicted under 924(c) are, in fact, sentenced at the\nmandatory minimum.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, in fact, your\nargument is that fixing a sentence is different than\ngiving a judge discretion because it ignores the fact\nthat a judge might have given you less?\nMS. MAGUIRE: That is exactly right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's depriving you of\nthe constitutional right to have a jury decide what your\nsentence could be?\nMS. MAGUIRE: That is exactly right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of having a judge decide\nwhat your sentence could be?\nMS. MAGUIRE: That is exactly right. And\nit's further depriving you -- it is depriving the\ndefendant of liberty interests. It is imposing a\nstigma, and it is entitling the prosecutor to a greater\nand more severe punishment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's -- I'm not\nsure that that's -- you've emphasized several times that\nit takes away the discretion of the judge. That seems,\nto me, to be a matter between Congress and the Judiciary\nand not a Sixth Amendment question.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nactually, the language of this Court in Apprendi said\nthat it is unconstitutional for the legislature to\nremove from the jury the assessment of facts that\nincrease the prescribed range of penalties to which a\ncriminal defendant is exposed.\nAnd that is exactly what's happening in this\ncontext because --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Apprendi, thought, did it\nboth ways. I mean, that's the best sentence for you in\nApprendi, but there are other sentences in Apprendi\nwhich more go towards what Justice Scalia suggested,\nthat the question was increasing it above the maximum\nthat the jury authorized.\nSo I'm not sure that we can get from the\nlanguage of Apprendi -- and I guess the question is, as\na matter of principle, why I -- I completely understand\nwhy a defendant would care about this. The question is\ndoes it -- does it create a Sixth Amendment violation,\nwhich is -- you know, the jury has to do this, when --\nwhen Congress is decreasing the judge's discretion, but\nit's -- either way, the jury isn't deciding this.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, Justice Kagan, we do\nbelieve the Sixth Amendment is implicated because we\nthink the history of the Sixth Amendment in this country\nshows that the role of the jury is the buffer between\nthe citizen meant to protect and the government.\nAnd mandatory minimums give the prosecution\nfar much power. And, in fact, if you do not adopt our\nrule and -- and make the government have to prove it\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, what happens is then the\naverage citizen does not get the benefit of a jury\nverdict, and his sentence is not driven wholly by the\njury verdict because, in this case, we had a jury\nverdict, the government alleged the fact, we had a\nspecial verdict form, the jury failed to find that fact.\nAs a result of that, then, the range to --\nthat Mr. Alleyne should have been exposed was a\nfive-year mandatory minimum and for the constitutional\nargument assuming a maximum of life. Here, what\nhappened and at the sentencing hearing was on a mere\npreponderance, the judge had to impose seven. And so we\nbelieve that is where you have the Sixth Amendment\nproblem because the defendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you quoted\nApprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide\nany fact which increases the sentence to which the\ndefendant is exposed. That's the language you quoted,\nand it's accurate.\nWhy does a mandatory minimum increase the\nsentence to which the defendant is exposed? He could\nget the mandatory minimum sentence, even if there were\nno mandatory minimum prescribed. He is exposed to a\nsentence of one to 10 years. A mandatory minimum says,\nyou must impose seven years if he brandishes.\nBut the sentence to which he is exposed is\none to 10 years. And the mandatory minimum does not\nchange that at all. He is at risk for one to 10 years.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, I understand that that\nmay not change the exposure. What it does, on a\npractical level, is it prevents the judge from even\nconsidering anything less than the seven years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.\nMS. MAGUIRE: And that becomes the problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. But you must\nacknowledge that that's not the theory of Apprendi.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, I think the theory of\nApprendi if you -- if you take it out to its logical\nstep, is that, if you have judicial factfinding that is\nresulting in a more harsh sentence being imposed, then,\nin fact, you have a Sixth Amendment problem.\nAnd so what happens on the mandatory\nminimums is that, if a judge finds the mandatory\nminimum, a more harsh sentence is being imposed because,\nas an example, in this case, the judge could not even\nconsider giving the five-year year floor as a mandatory\nminimum, which we've already noted is, in fact, how most\ncriminal defendants are sentenced under the 924(c)\nstatute at the mandatory minimum level.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the logic of\nApprendi is that the jury has to decide it if it\nincreases the sentence to which the defendant is\nexposed, not if it eliminates some discretion of the --\nof the Court. He's exposed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about Booker? What\ndid Booker do --\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to the logic of\nApprendi?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Justice Sotomayor, what I\nbelieve that Booker did is that Booker indicated that\nwhen you have a fact that drives -- a finding of fact\nthat drives a mandatory sentence to be imposed, that,\nobviously, that was the Sixth Amendment problem.\nNow, I understand and appreciate --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even when the statutes\nhad a higher maximum?\nMS. MAGUIRE: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because the jury was --\nbecause the judge was constrained within a different\nmaximum?\nMS. MAGUIRE: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that your argument\nhere?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Yes. And so what I believe is\nthat what Booker indicates is that it is this mandatory\neffect which may -- and that is why this Court found --\nextending Apprendi in the Booker case, that, in fact,\nthe guidelines then had to become advisory. It is the\nmandatory effect of the factfinding that is essential in\nthese cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't a mandatory\nminimum case. Booker was a case in which the maximum\nwas increased on the basis of judge finding of fact.\nThe maximum was increased. So, under the situation in\nBooker, the -- the exposure of the defendant was,\nindeed, increased on the basis of judge factfinding.\nInstead of one to 10, the statute in -- in Booker said,\nif you brandish a gun, you can get 15.\nThat's a -- that's a quite different\nsituation from saying, yes, you are still on the hook\nfor one to 10, but, if you brandish, you got to get 7.\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nthe concern in Booker was the mandatory nature of the\nguidelines. And while I would agree with you, that this\nCourt, in its constitutional part of the Booker\ndecision, did, in fact, look to the increase in the\nmaximums, it is the same problem. You have judge --\njudicial factfinding that is mandating a particular\nsentence.\nAnd that is where you have the Sixth--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is Booker -- why is\nBooker entitled to greater stare decisis weight than\nHarris and McMillan?\nMS. MAGUIRE: Well, I believe that Booker\nis -- is entitled to greater weight because it was more\nrecently decided by this Court, and I also believe that\nit is a more recent interpretation of this Court of the\nprinciples held in Apprendi.\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court should adhere to its decision in\nHarris v. United States, which reaffirmed\nMcMillan v. Pennsylvania because those decisions\nproperly respected the fact that a mandatory minimum\ndivests the defendant of the right to judicial leniency.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I go back to a\nsimple question on the stare decisis, the practicality\nquestion?\nWhat is so impractical about letting a jury\ndecide an issue that sets a mandatory sentence of any\nkind? Why -- why are juries incapable of figuring out\nwhether a gun was carried or brandished? Why are they\nincapable of figuring out how many -- how much drugs\nwere sold or whether someone was driven by any of the\nfactors that States want to commit to judges, but the\nSixth Amendment might require them to submit to juries?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, the\ngovernment's argument here is not that juries are\nincapable of finding facts under the Federal statutes\nthat involve mandatory minimums. It's that Congress has\nsound reasons for wishing to allocate that factfinding\nto the sentencing process and that it is not\nunconstitutional for Congress to do so.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have\nto do with the needs -- the constitutional need to make\nsure that juries are driving a fixed sentence of any\nkind?\nMR. DREEBEN: The -- the constitutional\nquestion, in my view, Justice Sotomayor, turns on\nwhether there is a right to the mercy of a tenderhearted\njudge. That is what a defendant loses when a judge\nfinds a mandatory minimum fact.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it isn't quite. I\nmean, the -- the linguistic difference -- I agree with\nJustice Scalia, and I agree with you. It turns on the\nword \"exposed.\" I mean, if you state Apprendi's holding\nas it was just stated, this is a different case because\nyou could, in fact, if you were the defendant, have been\nsentenced to that anyway. That's your argument.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, let's put it\ndifferently. There is a fact in the world. There's a\ngun, or there wasn't a gun. In the Apprendi case, if\nthe fact turns out to be gun, you could get two more\nyears. All right? We have to go to the jury. Now,\nhere there's a fact in the world, gun or not gun.\nIf it turns out not gun, you get a lower\nsentence, you could. And, if it turns out to be the\nfact, gun, you can't -- the judge cannot put you in that\nbox. He has to put you in a worse box. He has to put\nyou in a worse box. He has to give you more than --\nmore than the three years, two years, or one year. He\nhas to. Okay?\nNow, from the point of view of the\ndefendant, worse or not -- at least as bad. From the\npoint of view of Congress, same. They drew some lines,\nwant a judge to administer them, and they turn on facts.\nAnd the sentence very often will turn on those facts.\nFrom the point of view of the judge, same.\nIt's the jury decides or he decides. In the one case,\nhis discretion is cut off to give a lower sentence. In\nthe other case, his discretion is granted to give a\nhigher sentence.\nNow, I see tremendous similarities, though I\ngrant you the words are different, but can you -- can\nyou just explain --\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- why the difference in\nthe words should overcome the fact that I can't think of\na -- of a difference, other than those words that\nhappened to be used in Apprendi?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, we have\na chart in our brief that I think is addressed\nexplicitly to the question that you are asking, and it's\non page 36 of our brief. And it illustrates the\ndifference between an Apprendi situation and a\nHarris-McMillan situation. So the government's gray\nbrief.\nAnd the point of the chart is this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What page? What page?\nMR. DREEBEN: This is page 36 of the\ngovernment's brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm afraid the other side\nwas upside down, and I saw what you meant.\nMR. DREEBEN: Okay. The point of Apprendi\nis a jury cannot be reduced to low-level gatekeeping.\nCongress cannot pass a statute that says it is a crime\nto assault someone, and that's punishable by one year in\nprison. But if the crime involves rape, then it's\npunishable by 10 years in prison. Or if the crime\ninvolves attempted murder, then it's punishable by up to\nlife.\nCongress can't do that because it would\ndiminish the role of the jury in finding the critical\nfacts that constitute the crime that sets the\ndefendant's maximum exposure. Apprendi protects against\nthat.\nIn a Harris situation, the defendant is\nalready exposed to the maximum penalty that the\ndefendant incurs under the statute, and that's what the\nsecond column illustrates. The defendant who commits a\nSection 924(c) crime knows that the defendant faces up\nto life in prison.\nWhen the mandatory minimum comes along, it\ndoesn't increase the defendant's exposure to the most\nsevere punishment he can get. It divests the defendant\nof a degree of judicial discretion. But the Sixth\nAmendment does not protect a right to judicial\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know, but that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the -- that's the --\nyou've used all the words, which do make the difference,\nin your mind. But my question --\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not just in my mind,\nJustice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is why should those\nwords make a difference?\nLook, in the one case -- I'll be repeating\nmyself, but I want you to see it. In the one case,\npresence of a fact or not means the defendant goes into\na higher sentencing box. In the other case, presence of\na fact or not means that he cannot go into the low\nsentencing box.\nMR. DREEBEN: And when he cannot --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the one case, he cannot\ngo into the low sentencing box; in the other case, he\ncan't go into the high sentencing box. I got that\ndifference.\nMy only problem is why does it make a\ndifference.\nMR. DREEBEN: It matters because the Sixth\nAmendment protects a right to a jury trial; it does not\nprotect a right to judicial leniency.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it's not -- well, you\ncan call it judicial leniency, but you could call the\nother judicial harshness. I mean, what is, in fact,\nturning out --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, because, in -- in the\nother situation, it protects the right of the jury to\ndetermine the ingredients of the crime that Congress has\ndetermined exposed the defendant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, here, we have the\ningredients of a crime that Congress has determined that\nyou have to get the five years.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, we know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, in the one case,\nyou can say all that Apprendi did. It never should have\nbeen decided -- I mean, some of us thought that --\nbecause, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wonder who -- I wonder\nwho that could have been.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All you're talking about\nthere is that you are stopping the judge from exhibiting\nhis otherwise discretion towards harshness, and that's a\nmatter for judges. I've heard all these arguments\nbefore, you see.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I've just heard them in\nthe context of harshness, and, now, I don't know why\nchanging it to leniency makes them somehow more\nrelevant. They weren't apparently relevant in the first\nsituation; so why are they relevant in this one?\nMR. DREEBEN: They weren't relevant\nin the first situation because, if there is no cap from\nthe maximum that a judge could impose based on judicial\nfactfinding, the role of a jury can be shrunk to what\nthe Court has called low-level gatekeeping. That can\nnever happen under a statute that increases only the\nmandatory minimum.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is that --\nMr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great\nquestion. Is the jury functioning as a low-level\ngatekeeper under the Harris rule? Because I could make\nthe argument that, in fact, it is -- you know, you take\na statute, and it says, five and up for carrying, and\nseven and up for brandishing, right? And this isn't\neven a hypothetical. This is pretty close to this case.\nIt goes to the jury. The jury says, we\nthink he was carrying, we do not think that he was\nbrandishing, all right? And then it goes to the judge.\nAnd, now, the judge says, you know what, if I had my\ndruthers, I would only give five years. If I had my\ndruthers, I absolutely would defer to the jury verdict,\nbut I can't defer to the jury verdict because Congress\nhas said I have to make this special factfinding, and\nthe truth of the matter is I think he did brandish, and\nso I have to give seven years.\nSo the judge is not deferring to the jury,\nand he's not deferring to the jury when he would prefer\nto do so. I guess the question is isn't that, in every\npractical sense -- doesn't the mandatory minimum\neffectively increase the maximum punishment that the --\nthat the defendant otherwise would get?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it certainly doesn't\nincrease the maximum punishment that's authorized under\nthe statute. And it doesn't prevent the judge from\nmaking the exact same finding by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the jury did not make beyond a reasonable\ndoubt and giving seven years, even if there were no\nmandatory minimums.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. But what I'm\nsuggesting is that in the world of judges -- you know,\nthis -- the graph you wrote has this very little\ndifference in the Harris situation between five and\nseven. But, in fact, most judges want to give five. I\nmean, that's the truth of the matter, that -- you know,\nnobody's giving a 97-year sentence.\nSo -- so the action in the criminal justice\nsystem is at this lower range. And, at this lower\nrange, what the mandatory minimums do is effectively\ntell a judge that they cannot defer to a jury verdict.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it's, first of all, not\nentirely accurate that judges do not give higher\nsentences than the minimum. There are plenty of cases\nin which they do so. If the 920 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's say --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I know there are plenty of\ncases. All I'm saying is it's not the unusual case to\nfind ourselves in exactly this position, where the judge\nwants to give five, the jury wants to give five, the\njudge can't defer to the jury's verdict that it should\nbe five.\nMR. DREEBEN: But taking away judicial\ndiscretion to treat a fact within the range differently\nthan what Congress wants doesn't infringe the jury trial\nright.\nThe jury can find facts by a -- beyond a\nreasonable doubt, but, when the judge is at sentencing,\nhe is not operating under that burden, so the\nfactfinding role of the jury --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you could say that\nwith reference to the -- to the maximum. Everything you\nsaid could be applied to the maximum, and Apprendi says\nyou can't say that.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it's quite\ntrue that everything that I said applies to the maximum,\nJustice Kennedy, because, as the plurality opinion in\nHarris explained, once the court has been confronted\nwith a defendant who's convicted, the judge's discretion\nextends up to the statutory maximum. He can't use his\nfactfinding ability to increase the defendant's exposure\nto criminal punishment. Mandatory minimums can never do\nthat.\nThe defendant is already exposed to the\nsentence that the judge could give. And I grant you,\nJustice Kagan, that some judges might choose to give a\nlower sentence. But the fact that they might choose to\nreflects judicial leniency, tenderheartedness, something\nthat the Sixth Amendment does not speak to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about in deference to\nthe jury's finding? I mean, in this -- this -- this\nvery case, wasn't it so that the judge said, I could\njust say seven years because it's within the range, but\nit would be dishonest of me to do that, wouldn't it? I\nhave to say seven because it's the mandatory minimum.\nI think this is a case where the effect\nis -- is shown graphically, that the judge says, I'm\nstuck with the seven; I would prefer five. That's what\nthe jury would lead me to do, but I'm -- my hands are\ntied, I cannot respect the jury's finding.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat the judge said he would be intellectually honest\nand not ignore the fact that the -- the finding of\nbrandishing did trigger the mandatory minimum. He did\nnot say, I otherwise would have given five. And I think\nthat this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But is it the usual case\nthat a judge, when faced with this decision, has before\nhim a jury finding? I -- that --\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not the usual case,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Petitioner is asking\nthese cases to be thrown out, even if there has been no\njury finding.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the judge says -- you\nknow, I have to decide whether he brandished or not; I\nthink he brandished. But I -- you know, the Petitioner\nhere wants to say, the judge cannot consider himself\nbound by a mandatory minimum. It seems to me the\nunusual case in which you have a jury finding, that the\njudge must ignore in -- in -- he actually doesn't ignore\nit, he goes along with it.\nThe jury may well be right, that it's\nimpossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that --\nthat the felon brandished a gun, but it's -- it -- it's\nquite easy to say that it's very likely he branded a\ngun -- brandished a gun, which is what the judge has to\nfind. So he -- he's not even ignoring the jury finding.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, there is no inconsistency\nbetween -- and I think, if you look at the way this case\nevolves, it's not even clear that the jury rejected\nbrandishing. What's very interesting about this case is\nit's possibly the best illustration of the unfairness\nproblem that Justice Alito alluded to and that\nJustice Breyer has written about in his opinions. The\nissue at trial in this case was identity.\nWas the defendant actually the person\nsitting in the car, while his accomplice walked up to\nthe victim and -- and put a revolver into his neck and\nasked for money? That was the issue at trial. There\nwas no discussion of brandishing whatsoever.\nNobody focused on it, and it allowed the\ndefendant, after the jury rejected his identity\nargument, to go to the judge and say, even though the\njury has now found that my guy did it, he could not have\nforeseen that a gun would have been used.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben, can I go\nback to a point you made earlier? You talked about a\nlegislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role\non the maximum. You don't see the same danger -- we\nstarted out in a country where almost all sentencing was\nin the discretion of the judge; whatever crime you\ncommitted, the judge could decide where to sentence you.\nAs Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid\nout, these sentencing changes that have come into\nexistence have really come into existence the latter\nhalf of the last century.\nWhat -- don't you fear that, at some point,\nthe legislature will go back to the old system of\nsupplanting the jury by just saying what it said in\n924(c)? Every single crime has a maximum of life.\nAnd all the -- and every single fact that's\ngoing to set a real sentence for the defendant, a\nminimum, we're going to let the judge decide by a\npreponderance of the evidence.\nThe bottom line of my question is, when\nApprendi was decided, what should be the driving force\nof protecting the jury system? The deprivation of\ndiscretion, whether that's permissible or not, or\nwhether a sentence is fixed in a range, whatever it\nmight be, by a jury?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the better rule\nto keep both extremes from happening?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Sotomayor,\nthat the Court recognized, in Apprendi, that its rule\nwas limited and to certain extent could be evaded by\nlegislatures, if they were inclined to do so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, I think that\nhistory is wrong. In fact, the way the country started,\nthere was no judicial discretion. There were simply\nfixed penalties for crimes. If you stole a horse, you\nwere guilty of a felony, and you would be hanged.\nThat's where we started.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I would think that the\nrisk involved is whether, if we come out the way that\nthe Petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will\nconsider going back to -- to where we started from and\nsimply saying, if you brandish, you get seven years,\nperiod, with no discretion in the judge.\nThat, it seems to me, is the greater risk.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I agree\nin part with both you and Justice Sotomayor on history.\nIn fact, if you look at the 1790 Crimes Act that the\nFirst Congress passed, many of the set sentences are\ndeterminant sentences.\nOthers of the sentences were -- were\nprescribed up to a certain amount of years. And, within\nthat, it was well understood that judges would find\nfacts to graduate the penalties according to the gravity\nof the crime.\nAnd what the legislatures have done in the\n20th Century innovation of mandatory minimums within an\notherwise authorized range, as you have with 924(c), is\nsay, we would prefer that judges take into account\nbrandishing and discharging, as under Justice Kagan's\nhypothetical statute, but we would like to -- to do that\nin a uniform manner.\nWe know that they can find, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that brandishing exists.\nWe know that many, if not most, judges would consider\nthat worse than simple possession of a firearm in a\ncrime of violence, and we want judges to behave\nconsistently.\nBy proscribing consistency, they are acting\nin accord with the historical tradition of having\ndeterminate sentences, a tradition that this Court held\nin Chapman v. --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, the\nhistorical -- you said, earlier, that most of the\nhistorical evidence was that determinate sentences would\nbe decided by juries; they found facts, and a\ndeterminate sentence was given.\nMR. DREEBEN: And there was no judicial\ndiscretion, which I think makes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the judicial\ndiscretion now? You find by a preponderance of the\nevidence, and a mandatory minimum makes you give seven.\nSo where is the judicial discretion?\nMR. DREEBEN: The judicial discretion is\nwhat the defendant is losing. He is not losing the\nright to a jury trial because the very same verdict\nauthorizes the judge to find brandishing and impose\nseven years.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think, for a\ndefendant in a constitutional right, that they are\nmore -- that it's constitutional to have a determinate\nsentence at seven and still constitutional -- and make\nthe jury find it by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt and\nthat it's still constitutional to have a determinative\nsentence of seven years, but have the jury find it by a\npreponderance of the evidence?\nMR. DREEBEN: To have the jury find it by a\npreponderance of the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are equal? Those\nare -- those are equal?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not just my position that\nit's constitutional for a -- a judge to find mandatory\nminimum triggering facts by a preponderance. I'm sure\nthat a legislature could allocate that to a jury, if it\nwishes to.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I know we said it in\nHarris.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The question here before\nus today is --\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. And I think that -- that\nnot only does it not contradict any decision of this\nCourt to allow the judge to make those findings, it\ndoesn't contradict the principle behind the jury trial\nright or the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, look, here's another\nway of putting the same point: With the mandatory\nminimum, the judge can't go below the five years, okay?\nBut you say, well, he could have gone below\nthe five years anyway, couldn't he have? I mean, you --\nhe could have given you the five years anyway -- sorry.\nHe could have given you the five years anyway. That's\nyour point.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. He could have\ngiven you the five years -- he could have given you the\nfive years if you'd been -- if you had been convicted of\na different crime.\nMR. DREEBEN: And that's the difference\nbetween this and Apprendi.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why does that make a\ndifference? The best way I thought of putting it is the\nheading on page 6 of their reply brief is almost right,\nI think.\nI mean, I -- it says it's -- it's permitting\njudges to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat compels sentences higher than a set of those\npermitted by the jury's verdict.\nThat's exactly what's going on here.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and I -- I want to\nknow, what is it? And the trouble is --\nMR. DREEBEN: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're just going to say,\nwell, he could have given the same sentence anyway. And\nI'm going to say, well, so what, why does that matter?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's descriptively accurate,\nbut it says nothing about the constitutionality of the\nprocedure. And I think that it's very important to\nfocus not only on the fact that stare decisis is in\nplay, but that Apprendi has been a very history-driven\narea of the law. Last term, when the Court extended\nApprendi to fines, it has found an ample historical basis\nfor doing so.\nIn this case, by comparison, there is no\nhistorical showing that would justify extending Apprendi\nto fines. Not only is there no direct analogy to a\n924(c) type statute, but the three pillars of their\nhistorical argument are extremely weak and strained\nanalogies.\nThe first one is simply that, to get a\nstatutory crime that was parallel to a common law crime,\nbut differed, the prosecutor had to charge all of the\nelements of the statutory crime in the indictment. That\nsays nothing about mandatory minimum sentencing.\nThe sentence -- second pillar of their\nhistorical argument is the procedure called benefit of\nclergy, which was a form of what Blackstone called a\nstatute pardon, that allowed a defendant to avoid a\ncapital sentence.\nIn the First Crimes Act, in Section 31, in\n1790, Congress said, \"Benefit of clergy shall not exist\nin the United States for any crime punishable by a\ncapital sentence.\" Benefit of clergy has never been\npart of this -- this country's Sixth Amendment heritage.\nIt was abolished before the Sixth Amendment was even\nratified.\nAnd the third pillar of their historical\nargument are three late 19th Century cases, Jones,\nGarcia, and Lacy, each of which involve statutes that\nboth raised the maximum and the minimum, not a single\none of them spoke about the Constitution. None of them\npurported to define what a legislature could do if it\nwanted to raise only the minimum, and that's it.\nAnd I would suggest to the Court that this\nkind of Gertrude Stein history, where there's really no\n\"there\" there, is not sufficient to overturn the\nlegislative prerogative to make uniform the findings of\nfact within a range --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, could I take\nyou back to the principles involved? Let's suppose\nthat, instead of this statute, which is 579, you had a\nstatute which was five for carrying, five up to life, and\nthen, for brandishing, 40. All right? And maybe if\nwe're discharging, 60. All right. So a very large gap.\nIs your argument still the same?\nMR. DREEBEN: The constitutional argument is\nthe same. I think this Court's decision in O'Brien\nsuggests that, unless the legislature were absolutely\nclear about it, the Court would conclude that those\nwould be deemed elements.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But suppose the\nlegislature --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I didn't hear\nyour last word. Those would be?\nMR. DREEBEN: \"Deemed elements.\" Under the\ndecision in O'Brien, where the machine gun finding\nraised the minimum to 30 years, the Court held that it\nshould be deemed to be an element, but --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But suppose -- suppose that\nCongress is absolutely clear about it, and you say --\nand I think that you're right, you've got to be right\nabout this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the\nsame, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what\nyou said our inquiry ought to be, is that, in a world\nlike that, the jury is, in fact, functioning only as a\nlow-level gatekeeper; isn't that right?\nMR. DREEBEN: No.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And that the only reason we\nsee it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly is\nbecause the numbers are a bit more dramatic.\nMR. DREEBEN: I wouldn't suggest that the\njury is being a low-level gatekeeper in that situation\nbecause the jury's verdict alone -- and this is a\nserious crime -- exposes the defendant to a life\nsentence. This is a crime that involves either a\npredicate Federal crime of violence or a Federal drug\ntrafficking crime, plus the use of the gun in it.\nAnd I think Congress could reasonably expect\nthat the worse the use of the gun, the more extreme, the\nhigher the corresponding penalty. And, indeed, if a\n924(c) violation is charged by itself, and a defendant\nis an armed career criminal, then his sentencing range\ngoes up to 360 months to life --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, there's something\ndeeply incongruous, isn't there, where you have an\nApprendi rule which says if the maximum is -- you know,\nif it's five to seven, and then the -- the judge says\nseven years and a day, we're going to take that out, but\nas a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five\nto 40 doesn't get the same result?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not incongruous if you\nlook at it from the point of view of the fact that the\njury verdict itself allows a life sentence. And if the\ndefendant draws the proverbial hanging judge who, in his\ndiscretion -- or her discretion, wants to give that life\nsentence, the defendant knew, from day one, when he\ncommitted the crime, that, if the jury finds him guilty\nof it, he's exposed to a life sentence.\nAnd the Court, in Apprendi, said structural\ndemocratic constraints will preclude legislatures -- or\nat least discourage them from assigning maximum\nsentences to crimes that are higher than what the\nlegislature deemed --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how about in O'Brien,\nif the legislature had said 40 years for a machine gun?\nWould we -- how do we justify saying, no, that has to\nremain an element? Under your theory, the democratic\nprocess didn't work.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I think that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how -- what would we\ndo in that situation?\nMR. DREEBEN: In that situation, the\ndemocratic process would have concluded that firearms\nbrandishing, discharge, or use of a machine gun is an\nextremely serious component of this crime. We know\njudges will take that into account in sentencing. We\nsimply want them to take that into account in the same\nparticularly harsh way.\nAnd in -- in trying to achieve uniformity\namong judicial actors, when finding facts at sentencing,\nwhich everybody knows that they will do, does not\ndeprive the defendant of a right to a jury trial on the\nelements of the crime; it deprives him of the right to a\njudge who might show mercy under a particular set of\nfacts.\nAnd that simply is not the right that's\nembodied in the Sixth Amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's -- I don't\nknow if you can add anything to this, but, remember, I\nagree with you about the history, but I just apply it to\nApprendi, too. So the one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is so bad he wants to\nextend it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought -- are you sure\nit was Gertrude Stein and not Dorothy Parker? But I\nthink you're probably right about that.\nBut the -- the -- I'm thinking of this as,\nwell, Apprendi, I see what they're thinking. They're\nthinking that, once you have to add the extra fact to\nget above the otherwise ceiling, it's like a new crime.\nIt isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime.\nOkay. But then I can say, well, once you\nhave to really cut off that five years and less and\nreally send him to jail for five years, hey, that's just\nlike a new crime. It isn't really a new crime, but it's\nlike a new crime.\nSo why can't I say everything that we said\nabout Apprendi here, except I can't deny what you say,\nthe judge could have given the sentence anyway. That's\nabsolutely right. But all the other things, I can say.\nIs that true?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I agree that you can say\nthem, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, are they true?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Respectfully, no.\nWe -- the critical point about Apprendi is,\nby assigning the role of constitutional element status\nto a fact that increases the maximum, the Court has\npreserved the jury trial right against its reduction to,\nessentially, a formality on a particular subset of\nelements. And the relationship of a crime that's\ncovered by Apprendi and the so-called base crime is like\na greater included offense and a lesser included\noffense.\nWhereas, in the mandatory minimum situation,\nwe know that the judge will be engaged in sentencing.\nWe know that the judge will find facts that extend\nbeyond the elements of the crime to inform himself about\nhow the basic crime is committed. We also know that\ndifferent judges may treat those facts differently after\nfinding them by the preponderance of the evidence.\nThe mandatory minimum changes only one\nthing. It says, Judge, if you find this fact,\nbrandishing or discharge, you will impose the same\nsentence as your neighboring judge down the hall, not a\ndifferent one based on your different perception of\nsentencing philosophy.\nSo it allows the legislature to intervene\nafter having defined a sufficiently serious enough crime\nand determine how the judges will treat those facts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is the legislature\nbeing deprived of that right, if they give it to the\njury?\nMR. DREEBEN: The legislature --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, it seems to me\nthat, whether you give it to a jury or a judge, the\nlegislature protects itself by declaring a minimum\nsentence.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are many ways --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It determines the\nsentence, really.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are many ways that a\nlegislature could achieve a goal that allows the judge's\nfactfinding to carry more weight. For one thing, it\ncould extend the maximum punishments and convert\neverything into an affirmative defense, which this Court\nsaid last week is constitutional.\nThe point is whether the defendant has\nreally been divested of a jury trial right when he loses\nthe right to the mercy of a judge.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMs. Maguire, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY E. MAGUIRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MAGUIRE: It is the effect of the\nfactfinding that is important, not what it is called. A\nmandatory minimum does, in fact, increase the exposure\nthat a defendant is -- is exposed to because his range\nthen goes from five to life, which was wholly authorized\nby the jury's verdict in this case, to seven to life,\nand that is an increase.\nAnd we are not talking about a right to\nleniency, but a right for the judge to consider the full\nrange that the jury authorized. And I would note the\nlanguage in Apprendi did, in fact, address this issue of\nrange when it said, \"One need only look to the kind,\ndegree, or range of punishment to which the prosecution\nis, by law, entitled for a given set of facts.\"\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
