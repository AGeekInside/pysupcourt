McCOLGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McCOLGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nFBI agents delayed presenting Mr. Corley to\na Federal magistrate judge in order to obtain his two\nconfessions. The admissibility of these two confessions\ndepends on an issue of statutory interpretation: The\ninterpretation of 3501(c), together with the\nMcNabb-Mallory rule and the right of prompt presentment.\nNow, there's two critical issues I would\nlike to address. The first is that 3501(c) as it's\nwritten by Congress leaves the McNabb-Mallory rule in\nplace outside the six-hour time limitation. And the\nsecond is that the Government's interpretation, under\nwhich 3501(c) is merely a voluntariness safe harbor, is\nunfaithful to the text and the structure of the statute.\nTurning to the first point, subsection (c)\nmodifies McNabb-Mallory, but does not eliminate it. The\nexact text of the statute here is crucial. And for the\nCourt's convenience, on page 7 of the yellow brief the\noperative language of the text of the statute is set\nout.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we -- before we\nget to the statute, McNabb-Mallory are exercises of this\nCourt's supervisory authority over the lower courts?\nMR. McCOLGIN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they were both\npre-Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of\nhis right to remain silent. Whatever Congress put in\n1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, McNabb-Mallory\nare no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.\nMR. McCOLGIN: This Court could, but for\nseveral prudential reasons this Court should not,\noverturn McNabb and Mallory and should not find them to\nbe no longer valid considerations. First of all -- or\nno longer valid precedents.\nFirst of all, the Solicitor General's Office\nhas not asked that McNabb and Mallory be overturned.\nSecond of all, the parties have not briefed\nthat issue. It has been briefed instead as a statutory\ninterpretation issue.\nThirdly, Congress through 3501(c) structured\nthe statute on the existing precedent of McNabb and\nMallory, and at this point for the Court to pull McNabb\nand Mallory out from underneath that structure would\ncause that structure to basically collapse. It depends,\nthe six-hour time limitation, depends on the existence\nof McNabb-Mallory outside that six-hour time period.\nCongress can revisit this issue at any time.\nTheir hands are not tied. Congress could choose to\nchange 3501(c) so that it no longer provides for McNabb-\nMallory outside the six-hour time period. But that's a\ndecision for Congress and this Court, I would suggest\nrespectfully, should respect the prerogatives and the\npolicy choice that Congress has already made.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you arguing that the\nlanguage in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory\nrule?\nMR. McCOLGIN: I am arguing that the exact\nlanguage, whether it is \"codification\" or \"leaves\nintact,\" doesn't matter. What it does is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There is a very big\ndifference, isn't there, between saying we are codifying\nthis rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and\nsaying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was\nadopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we are\ncreating an exception to it? Which of those two things\ndoes subsection (c) do?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, it does the\nlatter. It leaves McNabb-Mallory in place. However,\nthe language of the statute uses the phrase \"time\nlimitation\" in the proviso. \"Time limitation\" implies\nmore than we're just not just touching McNabb-Mallory\nfor the time being. It depends -- the statute depends\non McNabb-Mallory to create the time limitation, because\nwithout McNabb-Mallory there is no limitation. After\nthe six hours nothing else happens unless McNabb-Mallory\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would be\nconsistent with the second purpose that you gave to say\nthat there's a six-hour safe harbor, whatever term you\nwant to call it, and beyond six hours the Court is free\nto reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what\nCongress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Well, but again, the language\nof the statute is \"time limitation.\" That's strong\nlanguage for Congress to use and it indicates that\nCongress intended to limit the taking of confessions to\nthose first six hours. There is no limitation without\nMcNabb-Mallory in effect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It is a little bit odd to\nsay that Congress has built a statute around a\nsupervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this\nCourt to reexamine the supervisory rule.\nMR. McCOLGIN: I am not actually saying that\nCongress has taken away the authority of the Court. I\nam saying as a prudential manner, since Congress can\naddress this on its own and since it structured the\nstatute on the foundation of McNabb-Mallory, it would be\nbest for this Court to leave up to Congress that policy\nchoice.\nCongress chose in 1968 to leave of\nMcNabb-Mallory protection against presentment delay in\nplace after six hours. It was a compromise, and it was\nthe appropriate compromise, because what it did was it\ncut out the first six hours during which there had been\nthe most problems with the application of\nMcNabb-Mallory. The six-hour time limitation\neffectively lowers the social cost of this rule of this\nrule of inadmissibility while maintaining the deterrent\neffect of McNabb-Mallory outside the six hours.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you were trying to\nget to page 7 of your yellow brief?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. On page 7 I\nset out the operative language of the statute. And what\nthe statute actually provides is that a confession shall\nnot be inadmissible solely because of delay if such\nconfession is found by the trial judge to have been made\nvoluntarily and made within six hours of arrest. Now,\nthe phrase \"inadmissible solely because of delay\" is\nclearly a reference to the McNabb-Mallory rule because\nthat is exactly what McNabb-Mallory does. It renders\nthe confession inadmissible solely because of delay if\nthe delay in presentment was unreasonable.\nSo what the statute is providing on its face\nis that a confession shall not be subject to the\nMcNabb-Mallory rule if it is voluntarily given and made\nwithin six hours. The six-hour provision means that\nMcNabb-Mallory is in effect outside of the six hours.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or it may just mean\nthat the confessions beyond six hours may be excluded\nsolely because of delay. In other words, if the judge\nsays, look, I don't want to hear about all this other\nstuff, it's just too long, he can't do that beyond the\nsix hours, but he can within the six hours.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Within the six hours he\ncannot exclude solely because of delay, even a voluntary\nstatement. That is the McNabb-Mallory principle,\ninadmissible solely because of delay. So what it's\nsaying is that McNabb-Mallory does not apply within the\nsix hours.\nNow the government's interpretation is that\nthis is simply a voluntariness safe harbor, and what\nthey do is they read the word \"inadmissible\" as being\nsynonymous with the word \"involuntary.\" But the text of\nthe statute shows that those two terms are not\nsynonymous, because the text of the statute says that in\norder for a confession to be admissible it must be\nvoluntary and made within six hours.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they have that textual\nproblem, but you have at least an equally big textual\nproblem, because you want to read the first sentence of\nsubsection (a) completely out of the statute based on\nsome supposition about what Congress was intending to\ndo. So really, if you live by the text you die by the\ntext. I don't see how you are going to succeed with a\nsubsection (c) textual analysis if you're going to\ndisregard the text of subsection (a).\nMR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, we don't\ndisregard the text of subsection (a). Instead, we just\napply the principle that a general provision, if it\nconflicts with a specific provision, the specific\ncontrols over the general. What we have in subsection\n(a) is a general statement that voluntary statements are\nadmissible. But if we read that the way the government\ndoes, as making admissible every voluntary statement,\nthen that would make subsection (c) completely\nsuperfluous.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if you read subsection\n(c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean\nsomething quite different from what it says literally.\nMR. McCOLGIN: No, it simply establishes an\nexception in the area of delay. This is the way\nstatutes work. When there is a conflict between a\ngeneral provision and a specific one, the specific must\ncontrol over the general. If it worked the other way\naround, it would render the specific superfluous. So\nthis has happened in statutes in numerous case. In 1983\nversus 2254, it was held that 2254 as a specific\nprovision controls over 1983. So this is an accepted\nprinciple of statutory interpretation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What you're -- you are not\narguing that there is a specific provision that controls\na general provision. You are arguing that an arguable\nnegative inference from an arguably more specific\nprovision reads new language into the text of a specific\nprovision. That's what you are arguing, isn't it?\nMR. McCOLGIN: With respect, no, Your Honor.\nWe are not making the negative inference argument that\nthe government suggests we are making in the first part\nof their brief. Instead, we are making the argument\nthat subsection (c) was constructed on the existing\nprecedent of McNabb and Mallory, which already\nestablished a rule of inadmissibility. Subsection (c)\nthen just carves out the first six hours from that. So\nit's not creating a rule of inadmissibility by negative\ninference. Rather it's just recognizing that a rule of\ninadmissibility already exists in the case law and the\npurpose of this statute was to simply carve out from the\nfirst six hours the McNabb-Mallory rule.\nThe government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't you argue that\nwhat happens when you are not within the safe harbor is\nsimply that the time period cannot alone govern, all\nright, but it can still be part of the list of things\nthat can be taken into account in determining\nvoluntariness under (b). Why doesn't that reconcile the\ntwo provisions?\nMR. McCOLGIN: That, again, is the\ngovernment's interpretation. But it requires a\nrewriting. It requires reading \"inadmissible\" as\n\"involuntary\" to interpret all of subsection(c) as a\nvoluntariness safe harbor. But Congress used the word\ninadmissible deliberately. That's a reference to the\nMcNabb-Mallory rule. McNabb-Mallory did not render\nconfessions voluntary or involuntary based on delay. It\nrendered them inadmissible. So that language is\ncrucial. This cannot be read as a voluntariness safe\nharbor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But admissibility is\ndefined in 3501 itself. (A) says that it shall be\nadmissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given; and\n(b) says what factors will be taken into account in\ndetermining whether it's voluntarily given.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. And (c)\nmakes clear that, at least for purposes of subsection\n(c), voluntariness is not enough for admissibility,\nbecause it says on its face that in order --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that. It is\nnot alone enough.\nMR. McCOLGIN: So the two terms --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if you are outside of\nthat safe harbor you cannot rely upon the time alone.\nBut why can't you rely on the time plus the other\nfactors?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, because the\neffect is again to allow for a confession to be\ninadmissible solely based on delay if it's outside of\nthe six hours.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not being admissible\nsolely on the basis -- I'm sorry. Delay is not the only\nfactor being considered in making the inadmissibility\ncall. Delay is one of the things; whereas, within the\nsafe harbor delay can't be taken into account at all.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Well, what the Congress said\nwas that delay alone cannot be a basis for\ninadmissibility within six hours.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. McCOLGIN: That leaves in place\nMcNabb-Mallory, under which delay alone is a basis for\ninadmissibility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It -- it leaves it in\neffect only if you ignore (a) and (b). (A) says that\nit's admissible if it's voluntary --\nMR. McCOLGIN: But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and (b) says it's\nvoluntary if you take into account the five factors, one\nof which is the period of time before arraignment.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, that depends.\nThe premise of that depends on the argument that\n\"inadmissibility\" is synonymous with \"involuntariness\"\nfor purposes of subsection (c), and \"admissibility\" is\nsynonymous with \"voluntariness,\" but they are not\nsynonymous as used in subsection (c).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are synonymous as\nused in (a).\nMR. McCOLGIN: Well, subsection -- as used\nin subsection --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (A) says that if it's --\nit's admissible if it's voluntary.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. However, as\nused in subsection (c), that should control, because the\nword \"inadmissibility\" is being used in that very same\nsentence. Since the very same sentence makes clear that\nvoluntariness is not enough for admissibility, it's\nclear that those two terms are not synonymous.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it your position\nthat the McNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than\nto ensure the voluntariness of the statement?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, it protects --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's what you're\ntrying to reach here?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor. It protects\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if that's true, then\nwhy is it that we would suppress the confession if it's\ncompletely voluntary? I mean, what's the link between\nsome other end that's being served by McNabb-Mallory --\nMR. McCOLGIN: It's protecting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- something other than\nvoluntariness and suppressing the confession?\nMR. McCOLGIN: It's protecting the right of\nprompt presentment. McNabb-Mallory was meant to prevent\nthe exploitation of delay in presentment as a means of\nobtaining a confession.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why do we want to\navoid delay in presentment? What reason do we give?\nAnd I assume there are reasons that -- to contact family\nand so forth -- other than voluntariness.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Well, voluntariness is\ncertainly a part of it. But it's in addition, because\nthere's rights that attach at presentment that allow a\ndefendant to make a much more informed decision as to\nwhether --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do those rights have\nto do with a confession that is conceded, for our\nanalytic purposes, to be voluntary?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Because the confession itself\nwas obtained through exploitation of the delay. During\na period of custody -- before presentment the defendant\nwas just in the hands of the zealous police officers who\nhave actually arrested him. It's a fundamental\nprinciple of our justice system that that period should\nbe as short as reasonably possible because during that\nperiod, as time goes on, the effect of the delay is to\nincrease the inherently coercive power of that uncertain\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you need fundamental\nprinciples when you have got Rule 5 of the Rules of\nCriminal Procedure? Don't they say that an arrestee\nshall be taken before a magistrate without unreasonable\ndelay?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Exactly, Your Honor. It's\nthe right under 5(a) to prompt presentment that is being\nprotected.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But all you are doing is\ntrying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the\nwholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if\nit's voluntary. If it's not voluntary, of course, it's\nrelated.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Well, the purpose of\nMcNabb-Mallory was actually to cut the line a bit short\nof having to actually make a voluntariness\ndetermination. It's a recognition that, even if the\nstatement is voluntary, that still there are inherent\ncoercive pressures that develop during a period of\npresentment -- of presentment delay, and that that\nperiod of time should be as short as possible so that\nthat coercive nature, the coercive nature of the\ninterrogation, doesn't cause the person to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you are saying a\nconfession can be coercive and still voluntary?\nMR. McCOLGIN: It's -- yes, Your Honor. Not\nin the sense that it's a coerced confession. I'm not\narguing that this was involuntary. Instead, I'm arguing\nthat McNabb-Mallory intends to avoid the voluntariness\nrequirement by establishing a prophylactic rule, so that\na presentment needs to be made as soon as reasonably\npossible after the arrest so that that delay cannot be\nexploited as a means of obtaining a confession. It both\nprotects the right to prompt presentment and it also --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this: What\nother remedy, other than suppression of the confession\nmade after six hours, is there available to the\ndefendants to enforce the interest in prompt\npresentment?\nMR. McCOLGIN: There is no other remedy\navailable. In fact, the message that an affirmance in\nthis case would send to law enforcement is that delay\nfor the purpose of interrogation is permissible and that\nthe right of prompt presentment is unenforceable.\nWithout McNabb-Mallory, this becomes an empty right.\nThere is no other remedy. And that's why particularly\nwhere the delay is purposeful, as we have in this case\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would that be the case?\nThe confession could still be suppressed on grounds of\ninvoluntariness?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is you don't\ntrust district judges to make accurate determinations as\nto whether the confession is voluntary or not. You need\n-- you need a rule that takes that out of their hands.\nMR. McCOLGIN: It's not that we don't trust\nthem. It's that delay for the purpose of interrogation\nshould not be pushed to that limit; that delay for the\npurpose of interrogation should not be permitted. The\ndelay, particularly where it's for that express purpose,\neven if the defendant cannot show that it rose to the\nlevel of involuntariness, still it's exploitation of\ndelay. It's a violation of the right to prompt\npresentment, and that violation of the right to prompt\npresentment under McNabb-Mallory renders that confession\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the purpose of the\nrequirement of prompt presentment?\nMR. McCOLGIN: The purpose of the right of\nprompt presentment is several-fold.\nFirst of all, it's because there are\ninherent coercive characteristics that develop during a\nperiod of custody, and a person, once arrested, should\nbe presented to a neutral magistrate so that the neutral\nmagistrate can both assign counsel, give an opportunity\nfor consultation with counsel, and can also inform the\nperson of his rights, address bail, and issues such as\nthat. So the right of prompt presentment is considered\nfundamental. It's considered a basic right, a basic\nstatutory right in our system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McColgin, what do you\ndo with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay\nlonger than six hours nondestructive of the\nadmissibility of the confession if the delay beyond six\nhours \"is found by the trial judge to be reasonable\nconsidering the means of transportation and the distance\nto be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge\nor other officer.\"\nI can think of a lot of reasons why you\ncan't do it within six hours other than the means of\ntransportation and the distance to be traveled.\nMR. McCOLGIN: We have to remember, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You see, if you take the\ngovernment's position that it really doesn't matter, it\ngets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those\nfactors into account, and the ultimate question is\nwhether the confession was reasonable.\nBut if you take your position, the defendant\nautomatically walks, or at least his confession is\nautomatically thrown out, and the only exception made is\nif the means of transportation and the distance to be\ntraveled made six hours impracticable.\nMR. McCOLGIN: No, Your Honor, that's not\nour position. Our position is that the first question\nis did the confession fall within that six-hour time\nperiod?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Or longer, depending on\ntransportation, means of transportation. For that\ndetermination of whether it falls within the exclusion\nperiod, only means of transportation or distance is\nconsidered, but once the confession is outside that\nperiod, then McNabb-Mallory applies and the confession\nmay still be admissible if the delay was necessary. And\nfor those purposes, once we are determining whether\nMcNabb-Mallory requires inadmissibility, the court can\nconsider, for example, emergency hospital treatment or\nunavailability of the magistrate. So all of those\nfactors can and do get considered once we get into the\ndetermination of whether McNabb-Mallory requires\nexclusion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that certainly is a\nvery back-door way of doing it, isn't it?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Not at all, Your Honor,\nbecause once we look at the structure of the statute\nwhat it's doing is carving out the first six hours from\nMcNabb-Mallory. So the determination of whether we are\nin that carve-out period is limited to transportation\nand distance, but once we are outside of it, we just\napply McNabb-Mallory, and that's McNabb-Mallory as it\nhas developed in the case law, which includes all of\nthese other considerations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why -- why was it\nappropriate to have a special rule for transportation?\nIn other words, everything that is covered by the\ntransportation proviso would, on your theory would on\nyour theory have been subject to consideration under\nMcNabb-Mallory anyway. So why did they simply have a\nsix-hour rule and leave any exceptions, transportation,\nunavailability of magistrate, medical emergency,\nwhatever, to -- to the leeway that McNabb-Mallory\nallows?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Because the first question,\nagain, is just whether to exclude the confession\naltogether from the McNabb-Mallory determination. And\nfor those purposes, they -- some Senators from larger\nStates where there's greater distances to travel wanted\nto make sure that there was an exception for\ntransportation and distance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So basically -- I don't\nmean this disparagingly, but basically the answer is\npolitics. Somebody from a State thought of it and\nnobody else said, well, gee, let's pile on some other\nprovisos. It's as simple as that in your view?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Exactly, Your Honor. There\nwas very little comment on it added at the -- at the\nlast minute. The Scott Amendment had just included the\nsix-hour provision, but then the proviso was added on\nthe floor at the very last minute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I see.\nMR. McCOLGIN: Your Honor, the government\nalso relies on 402 as a basis for arguing that\nMcNabb-Mallory has been basically overturned by\nCongress. Rule 402, however, clearly does not apply\nhere. The advisory notes -- the advisory committee\nnotes make clear that Rule 402 was never intended to\noverturn McNabb-Mallory. In fact, the advisory\ncommittee identified McNabb-Mallory as a rule of\ninadmissibility that was meant to stay in place even\nafter the implementation of Rule 402.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At least one time limit\nthat has been complied with -- and that's the Fourth\nAmendment, how long you can keep somebody seized without\ntaking them before a magistrate -- there is no violation\nof that time period, is there?\nMR. McCOLGIN: That's correct, Your Honor,\nthe McLaughlin principle that less than 48 hours is\npresumptively reasonable. However, Congress in -- in\n3501(c) chose to set a six-hour time period for the\ntaking of confessions and to leave McNabb-Mallory in\nplace outside that time period.\nI would suggest that Congress struck an\nappropriate balance at that time, keeping McNabb-Mallory\nin place for the more extreme types of delay, but\neliminating it from the shorter periods of delay. And,\nin doing so, Congress struck an appropriate balance, and\nI would suggest that this Court should respect the\nbalance that Congress has struck. Unless there is any\nfurther questions, I would ask that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just have one question.\nDo you think the -- that the D.C. Circuit -- the statute\npertaining to the District of Columbia is relevant?\nMR. McCOLGIN: As legislative history, yes,\nYour Honor, because the 3501(c) was modeled on the D.C.\nlegislation, which established clearly a three-hour time\nperiod. And the legislative history for that was very\nclear that they intended to leave McNabb-Mallory in\neffect outside that time period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. McCOLGIN: No further questions? Thank\nyou, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's important in this case to go back and\nlook at the original Rule of Exclusion that this Court\ndeveloped in the McNabb case in 1943 and then reiterated\nin the Mallory case in 1957. Both of those cases\nconsidered a pre-Miranda regime in which there was no\nconstitutional law that required that a suspect be\nadvised of his rights.\nUnder Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure and under statutes that preceded it\nthat were in effect at the time of McNabb, the only way\nto ensure that a suspect was informed of his rights to\nsilence and counsel was to bring him before a\nmagistrate, and the magistrate would advise him of those\nrights. This Court in McNabb and Mallory thus fashioned\na judicial rule of evidence, an exclusionary rule under\nthe Court's supervisory power not as an effectuation of\nsomething that Congress specifically intended but of its\nown force as a way to backstop the Rule 5 requirement.\nIn the government's view, two acts that came\nsubsequently to McNabb and Mallory, section 3501 and\nRule 402 of the Federal Rules --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask before you\nget to those, Mr. Dreeben: Other than the McNabb-\nMallory Rule, what was available as a sanction for\nviolations of the rule of prompt presentment?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, I am not sure\nthat there is any evidentiary sanction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, not -- apart from an\nevidentiary sanction.\nMR. DREEBEN: None has risen in the case law\nthat I can point Your Honor to. I think the primary\nsafeguard of the enforcement of Rule 5 is the obligation\nthat is placed on the government and on government\nagents to comply with rules of criminal procedure that\nare valid.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So at the time that\nMallory and McNabb were decided the Court thought that\nan extra rule was necessary to give the government an\nincentive to comply with prompt-presentment\nrequirements. The very same factors are still at work\ntoday, aren't they?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think that they\nare, Justice Stevens, because the -- the critical thing\nthat the Court was doing in Mallory and McNabb was\ntrying to come up with a way to ensure that suspects\nwere advised of their rights to protect against abuses\nin the interrogation process. And the Court's ultimate\nconstitutional solution to that lay years in the future.\nIt came in the form of Miranda.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I am not -- we are\nnot talking about a constitutional problem but a rule\nproblem encouraging compliance with the -- the -- with\nthe rule that requires prompt presentment.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that what the Court\nwas after-\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I say that to the extent\n-- to the extent that was a motivating factor in McNabb,\nit seems to me that it would be precisely the same\nmotivating factor in McNabb.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that it was not\nthe sole motivating factor in McNabb.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Not the sole, but it was a\nmotivating factor. And it would have equal strength\ntoday as then.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I would not agree that it\nwould have equal strength.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, wouldn't --\nwouldn't you still have this disincentive which --\nwouldn't you still have this disincentive, which is\nconsiderable? If you -- if you exceed the time limit,\nit may be taken into account in determining that the\nconfession was involuntary.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, certainly, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that enough of a\ndisincentive? If you delay too long, that delay is one\nof the factors to be taken into account in deciding\nwhether the confession was voluntary.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, excessive delay can be a\n-- it is by statute a factor that will be taken into\naccount in determining --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about Rule 5?\nAnd Rule 5 doesn't say a word about voluntary. It says\nunnecessary delay -- shall be brought before a\nmagistrate without unnecessary delay. So whatever the\nbalancing there may be in 3501, I think what you're\nsaying is that Rule 5(a), which just says bring\ntheoretically before a magistrate without unreasonable\ndelay, that that has no teeth; that that is effectively\nunenforceable.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it is unenforceable by\nthe exclusion of a confession that results from what a\ncourt concludes is unnecessary delay. And I think that\nthat is true for two reasons, by virtue of congressional\naction and rulemaking action. And I think that as an\nadditional actor this Court, which struck that\nsupervisory powered balance in a pre-Miranda era, would\ndo well to consider whether the factors that motivated\nit to suppress confessions in McNabb and Mallory should\nstill be evaluated the same way today.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But isn't your -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 5 is about\nunnecessary delay, and here we have a case, if I\nremember the facts right, where the officer said, yes,\nthe reason we didn't bring him before a magistrate\nsooner is because we wanted to get a confession from\nhim.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, what\nhappened in this case is that the suspect was given his\nMiranda rights and waived them and agreed to give a\nconfession. There are three circuits and the D.C. local\ncourt which all have concluded that a waiver of Miranda\nrights waives the right to prompt presentment. So the\nquestion of whether there was in fact unnecessary delay\nthat would constitute a violation of Rule 5 has not been\nlitigated in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must be losing the thread\nof the argument. It seems to me that McNabb and Mallory\nonly provide punishment for excessive delay where there\nhas been a confession. Isn't that right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so long as the length\nof the -- the delay can still be considered as one of\nthe elements in determining that the confession -- that\nthe confession is involuntary, there is still a degree\nof incentive based upon only the confession. Now, it --\nit may not be as high a degree -- that it is\nautomatically excluded -- but the police are going to\nhave to consider that any confession they may get within\nthat period of excessive delay may be challengeable.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is certainly challengeable\non voluntariness grounds. Now, the Court's motive-\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is still true they have\neverything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to\ninterrogate.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, they do have something\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If they don't get the\nconfession within six hours, they haven't got it. So if\nthey continue on, their only purpose is to try to get a\nvoluntary confession.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, to the\nextent that it is correct that a waiver of Miranda\nrights waives the prompt presentment right and prevents\nan objection based on whatever survives of\nMcNabb-Mallory, the officers are doing nothing wrong if\nthey obtain a valid Miranda waiver; and this was just\nnot a factor that the Court had on the horizon when it\ndecided McNabb and Mallory.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't there a -- a new\nfactor now that the Court has decided Miranda? And\nyou've argued that we should regard this in the\npost-Miranda light, but I think there is at least one\nway of doing that that cuts against the government's\nargument and I would like your response to that.\nThat is that in the post-Miranda world in\npractical terms, if a -- if a court in considering a\nsuppression motion finds that the Miranda warnings were\ngiven and that after they were given this individual\nsaid, okay, I'll talk, that is in practical terms the\nend of the issue. The notion that there is a -- an\nindependent voluntariness concern is pretty much theory,\nnot practice.\nGiven what I think is the, kind of the\nreal-world effect of Miranda -- say the magic words, get\nthe defendant to say, I'll talk, that's it -- doesn't it\nmake sense to have a further safeguard in something like\nthe six-hour rule understood as preserving\nMcNabb-Mallory after the six hours?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter, I think\nthat is purely a question of policy of whether there\nshould be such a strong exclusionary rule that mandates\nthe barring from admission into evidence of a purely\nvoluntary confession where there's no dispute about its\nvoluntariness because the officers delayed beyond six\nhours.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I agree with you; it\nis an issue of policy. But I thought your whole\nargument for considering this as a post-Miranda case was\nin effect a -- a policy context in which you wanted us\nto decide this.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's a policy context that I\nthink Congress has decided in two different enactments,\nand I think that if this Court were to reach it as a\nmatter of policy, it should revisit the balance that it\nreached in McNabb-Mallory because of the changed legal\ncontext. But this is a case about section 3501 and\nabout Federal Rule of Evidence 402.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I knew you were going to\nget to 3501 eventually.\nMR. DREEBEN: I am glad that I have finally\nreached it.\n(Laughter)\nMR. DREEBEN: Section 3501 on its face says\nnothing about excluding any evidence. What it says is\nthat in section (a) voluntary confessions are\nadmissible. In section (b) it says that in determining\nvoluntariness, a court will consider a variety of\nfactors under the totality of the circumstances,\nincluding prearraignment delay. Then in subsection (c),\nit attacks more directly the McNabb-Mallory rule. And\nas originally formulated it would have wiped out\nMcNabb-Mallory altogether; there is no dispute about\nthat. After the bill was introduced there was a\nmodification of it on the floor of the Senate in which a\nsix-hour limitation was put in.\nNow, the effect of that six hours is to say\nthat within six hours after the arrest delay by itself\ncan never be an exclusive grounds for suppression; it\njust can't. And to that extent it overrules\nMcNabb-Mallory to the extent that McNabb-Mallory would\nhave allowed less than six hours of delay to serve as a\nbasis for suppressing evidence. Outside of six hours,\nit does not say that evidence is suppressed. It simply\nleaves that determination to other sources of law.\nIn the government's view, the primary source\nof law that controls the answer to that question is\nsubsection (a), which says that voluntary confessions\nare admissible, and I believe that, as Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that is the answer, why\ndo we need (c) -- I mean, why did Congress need (c) at\nall?\nMR. DREEBEN: Congress never needed (c); (c)\nin the government's view was always superfluous, even at\nthe time when it directly said delays shall never be the\ngrounds for suppressing a confession. There was already\na provision in (a) that said voluntary confessions are\nadmissible and it was well understood that\nMcNabb-Mallory -- and this Court was very explicit on\nthe point -- excluded totally voluntary confessions.\nSo if this Court has nothing before it but\nthe text of the statute, subsection (a) makes voluntary\nconfessions admissible, and the only way that Petitioner\ncan get around that is to say that section 3501(c)\ncarved something out of subsection (a).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if it doesn't, Mr.\nDreeben, what do the words \"time limitation\" mean in the\nproviso?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's the limitation on a --\nthe period during which a court cannot rely exclusively\non delay within the meaning of the statute. It simply\n-- it carves out six hours from McNabb-Mallory plus\nreasonable transportation delays, and it leaves the\nsix-hour -- after the six-hour period to other sources\nof law.\nNow, one source of law -- and this is where\nPetitioner looks -- would be McNabb-Mallory. But\nMcNabb-Mallory is not a constitutional rule of decision.\nThis Court has been clear, most recently in the\nSanchez-Llamas decision, that it is a rule of\nsupervisory power created by this Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are really asking the\nCourt to overrule McNabb-Mallory, because you say\nCongress provided six hours, no McNabb-Mallory, but\nafter six hours the test is voluntariness -- only\nvoluntariness. So there's nothing left under the\ngovernment's view of McNabb-Mallory.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct, but the\nmodification, Justice Ginsburg, is that I think Congress\nhas displaced McNabb-Mallory. It obviously cannot\noverrule a decision of this Court, but it can prescribe\na rule of law that takes precedence over a decision of\nthis Court that rests on its supervisory power.\nPetitioner does not contend that\nMcNabb-Mallory was an interpretation of Rule 5 of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and I don't think\nthat he could do that. This Court was explicit that the\npredecessor statute that existed before Rule 5 and\nprovided the prompt presentment requirement did not\naddress the issue of remedy.\nAnd it's notable I think that in the\npreliminary draft of the Rules of Criminal Procedure a\nrule of exclusion was explicitly provided. The rule\nwould have said: \"No statement made by a defendant in\nresponse to interrogation by an officer or agent of the\ngovernment shall be admissible in evidence against him\nif the interrogation occurs while the defendant was held\nin custody in violation of this rule.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what if the\nother reasons apply? I take it the words\n\"self-incriminating statement\" in (e) means any adverse\nevidence?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that's right,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, there are a lot\nof reasons we exclude evidence. You know, I mean -- it\nmight, for example, might not in the circumstance be\nworth the confusion. It might not in the circumstance\nbe worth the time. It might violate -- I don't know,\nthere is like a whole -- there are many reasons.\nSo in your opinion, does section (a) mean to\nset aside all the reasons? In other words, if for some\nother reason this particular piece of self-incriminating\nevidence, adverse evidence obtained after 30 hours,\nviolated the admission, violated some totally different\nrule of evidence, as your opinion does (a) mean, judge,\nit doesn't matter if it's triple hearsay or it doesn't\nmatter if it violates some authentication requirement,\nit doesn't matter if it violates, you know, it has to be\nrelevant, pertinent, not a waste of time -- it doesn't\nmatter; admit it?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, of course it doesn't\nmean that.\nMR. DREEBEN: If the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if it doesn't mean that,\nthen why does it mean that we should ignore this other\nrule of evidence contained in Rule 5 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's precisely my\npoint, Justice Breyer. The other rules that might\npermit exclusion of a voluntary confession in the Rules\nof Evidence are explicit, or they are there because the\ncourts interpreted that rule to require it. That's not\nwhat happened in McNabb-Mallory, and I don't think\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are -- there\nare, in other words, as you have heard, a number of\nthings that can happen when you hold a person, let's say\nfor 40 hours for 29. I mean, one thing that happens is\nhe doesn't learn how he gets out on bail. Another thing\nhe happens, he doesn't learn exactly what the charge is\nagainst him. Another thing -- they are all listed in,\nin Rule 5.\nAnd -- and when you have an exclusionary\nrule, you enforce not only what you are talking about,\nwhich I understand, which is the voluntariness part, but\nyou also enforce all these other things that happen when\nyou bring a person before a magistrate and don't keep\nhim for 70 hours or something.\nSo why should we interpret (a) as setting\nthose other things aside and requiring us to overturn\nMcNabb and Mallory?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, McNabb and Mallory are\nnot constitutional decisions of this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not.\nMR. DREEBEN: They were attempts to\neffectuate a particular policy choice. That policy\nchoice was one that Congress was free to revisit, and I\nsubmit it did revisit in two different provisions, one\nin 3501(a) and the other in Federal Rule of Evidence\n402.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did it say anything in the\nlegislative history, which interests me, that the\npurpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and McNabb?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Breyer, and I will\nconcede to you the legislative history on the point that\nsection (a) was considered to overrule Miranda and\nsubsection (c) was addressed to McNabb-Mallory.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer\nsuggested that there are rules of evidence other than\nthose based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that\nmight result in the exclusion of a confession. Maybe\nthere are such rules, but I'm trying to think of them.\nI can't think of what they might be. Certainly it's not\nhearsay. Is it ever going to be ruled to be irrelevant?\nIs it common for a confession to be excluded under Rule\n403? Are there rules that would --\nMR. DREEBEN: I think in theory Rule 403 is\nsuch a rule. Rule 16, which requires discovery\nobligations, contains its own authorization for an\nexclusionary rule. And my answer to Justice Breyer on\nthose rules is that they are explicitly provided by\nCongress. The difference in a Rule 5 --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you familiar with cases\nin which a defendant's confession has been excluded\nunder -- under 403?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wasn't focusing on the\nword \"confession.\" I was focusing on the words in (e),\nwhich were \"any self-incriminating statement.\" And\nthat's why I asked you if you interpreted that to\ninclude anything that the individual said after, say,\n29 hours that might turn out to be adverse to that\ndefendant's interests. And your answer to that was yes.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think you are right.\nI think we agree on that.\nSo, if the defendant said, if you look under\nthe rock you will find the writing such-and-such, it\nmight not be authenticated for that particular writing.\nThere are many reasons. It might be triple hearsay,\nwhat he says. I mean, you know, there are a variety of\nthings, aren't there? Maybe I am wrong.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the general principle\nis what the Court ought to be focused on here. And the\ngeneral principle is, yes, if there is some specific\nprovision that should be together with subsection (a) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason I brought that\nup is not to be technical. The reason I brought it up\nis to point out that there are many, many words that a\nperson could utter in confinement under 30 hours, which\nin a variety of ways could stab him in the back without\nit having anything to do with Miranda, without it having\nanything to do with coerced confession.\nAnd similarly, there are many reasons for\nbringing him forward that have nothing to do with\neither. And therefore, I wonder if all those reasons\ncould support retaining McNabb-Mallory, a matter about\nwhich Congress said nothing.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it would be quite\nextraordinary for the Court to decide to revive its\nsupervisory power decisions in McNabb and Mallory. They\nclearly were aimed at the problem of incommunicado\ndetention with a suspect who did not know his Miranda\nrights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, I tend to\nthink that what we should be focusing on is the language\nof 3501. Can I bring you back to that? What I do not\nunderstand about your argument is the following: The\nsix -- the six-hour safe harbor applies only when the\nconfession is made voluntarily, right?\nI would think that the proviso likewise\nassumes voluntariness. That is, the time limitation\ncontained in this subsection, it's a time limitation\napplicable to voluntary confessions. And it says that\ntime limitation shall not apply in any case in which the\ndelay in bringing the person is beyond six hours is\nfound by the trial judge to be reasonable.\nI think you have already voluntariness\nassumed in the proviso, but you want us to go back and\nre -- reconsider voluntariness under (a). I just don't\nthink that's -- that's a fair way to read it.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the statute, as we\nread it, contains some overlap in voluntariness\nrequirement, and we interpret the voluntariness\nreference in subsection (c) to really mean otherwise\nvoluntary; in other words, not to be deemed involuntary\nsolely on the basis of delay, but otherwise voluntary.\nAnd in that sense section 3501(c) does\ncontain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I am reading it that\nway, too. Otherwise voluntary is in the safe harbor.\nMR. DREEBEN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then when you have a\nproviso, which refers to the time limitation contained\nin this subsection, it's a time limitation upon\nvoluntary confessions.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's a -- it's a limitation on\nthe time during which a judge may not rely on delay\nalone to find a confession inadmissible. That's all\nsubsection (c) does. It says, judge, you may not find\nthe confession to be inadmissible solely because of\ndelay if it's within six hours plus reasonable\ntransportation delays.\nAnd our interpretation of that language is\nthat the inadmissibility as you mentioned,\nJustice Scalia, refers back to subsection (a), which\nspeaks about confessions that are admissible if they are\nvoluntarily given.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't the statute\nsay, instead of saying inadmissible, shall not be found\ninvoluntary solely by reasons of delay. Because it\nseems to me that your argument twain the two.\nMR. DREEBEN: It is, and I think the reason\nthat it was written that way, Justice Souter, is it was\na direct attempt to make clear that McNabb-Mallory shall\nnot operate in the six-hour period after arrests and\nbefore presentment.\nIt was an attempt to displace McNabb-Mallory\nexplicitly. Originally it was to displace it\naltogether. As it ended up being written, it displaced\nit for six hours. And our submission is that you read\nthe rest of the statute to determine what happens to\nconfessions that are taken outside of six hours. And I\nwould recognize that this makes subsection (c) in\ncertain respects unnecessary to achieve the result that\nvoluntariness controls.\nBut the most that Petitioner argues and he\nmade it very clear today, the most that he argues is\nthat section 3501(c) leaves McNabb-Mallory to live\nanother day for confessions outside of six hours. And\nif that is true, then the government's position is that\nCongress, in 1975 in Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence provided the bases on which relevant evidence\ncan be excluded. And it listed four sources and they\nare the Constitution, an act of Congress, a rule of\nevidence, or -- and this is the relevant one -- other\nrules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to\nstatutory authority.\nAnd what Congress meant by that were rules\nthat this Court promulgates pursuant to Rules Enabling\nAct authority. It did not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's Rule 5.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. Rule 5 it certainly\nprescribed pursuant to Rules Enabling Act authority,\nalthough it was originally enacted by Congress. But\nRule 5 contains no exclusionary rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And as you have said\nwithout the exclusionary rule, Rule 5(a) has no teeth at\nall. And I agree with that. It says -- it's a straight\nout command, no unnecessary delay. And isn't the reason\nfor 5(a) exactly what happened here? This was a case\nwhere the police officers were trying to admit that the\nsole reason that they didn't bring Corley before a\nmagistrate properly was to extract a confession.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's exactly what\nMcNabb-Mallory was trying to --\nMR. DREEBEN: There is a crucial difference\nbetween this Court deciding that there is a command in\nthe Rules of Criminal Procedure and we as a court are\ngoing to back it up by an enforcement mechanism, which\nis the supervisory power route, and Congress saying what\nwe intend is that a violation of this rule produced\ninadmissibility of a confession. Congress has never\nsaid the latter. This Court, in promulgating rules of\nevidence, have never said the latter.\nAnd what that leaves the Court with is the\noption of persisting in McNabb-Mallory as a supervisory\npowers decision or following the text of Rule 402 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, which says that there isn't\nany authority to say that relevant evidence is out of\nthe case simply because of the Court's views on\nsupervisory powers --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, do you think\nthe Rule 402 argument is strong enough to prevail even\nsection -- the statute that has never been enacted?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The statute was really\nunnecessary to overrule McNabb-Mallory, in your view?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Congress focused on the\nproblem of confessions in section 3501 and it dealt with\nMcNabb-Mallory in section 3501(c). We submit that the\ntext of the statute provides an answer to McNabb-Mallory\nin section 3501(a).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is superfluous and\nunnecessary answer if your interpretation of the rules\nis correct?\nMR. DREEBEN: It came many years before,\nJustice Stevens. In 1968 when Congress reacted to this\nCourt's Miranda decision and to McNabb-Mallory, it\npassed section 3501. Rule 402 is a very general rule\nthat says the policy of the federal courts is that we\nare not going to have evidence rules made any more by\ncase-by-case decision by the Supreme Court. We are\ngoing to have them promulgated in a code of Federal\nrules, and if the Court wants to change them, it can do\nthat through the revisory committee process, and it\nwould be open to Congress at any point, which has\nsuperior ability to gather facts and to survey the\nimpact of whether there is a pattern of violations of\nrule 5 that warrants the very strong --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We could never acknowledge\nor recognize a new privilege, then, for example --\nMR. DREEBEN: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- psychiatrists or\nsomething like that?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I think the Court did that\nand quite properly did it, Justice Stevens, because rule\n502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- 501 or 502 says\nthat principles of privilege shall be developed in light\nof reason and experience, and so it was a specific grant\nto this Court of the authority to do that.\nBut beyond that Congress did not intend that\nthe Court use supervisory powers to exclude relevant\nevidence. There is a rulemaking process; if the bench\nand bar want to get together and conclude as they did\nnot conclude in 1943 -- this is the point I was trying\nto make to Justice Breyer -- in 1943 after this Court's\ndecision in McNabb, there was explicit consideration of\nan exclusionary rule provision in rule 5; it engendered\nenormous controversy; it was rejected; it was taken out\nof the rule and it was never promulgated.\nSo McNabb-Mallory exists not by virtue of\nthe rulemaking process but by virtue of a supervisory\ndecision of this Court more than half a century ago in\nan entirely different legal climate, in a climate where\nthe costs of excluding a reliable, probative confession\nwere not balanced against the benefits, if any, to be\nachieved by enforcing of a prompt present requirement\nthrough exclusion.\nSince that time this Court's Miranda\njurisprudence has made it far more inappropriate for the\nCourt to conclude that the enforcement of a rule-based\nmechanism which serves as a prophylactic to protect\nvoluntariness should now result in exclusion of a\nconfession when rule 501 says voluntary confessions come\nin and section -- and rule 402 says that relevant\nevidence comes in unless excluded by four sources --\nnot-\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any indication\nof the rules advisory committee, any of their notes,\nthat 402 was meant to overturn McNabb-Mallory?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I -- Justice Ginsburg, the\nrules advisory committee notes I think reflect an\nexpectation that McNabb-Mallory was the law. Our\nsubmission is that the text of 402 is simply\ninconsistent with that, because it is quite explicit in\nlimiting the sources of rules that can bar the admission\nof admissible evidence; and the phrase that is in 402,\nwhich is on page 29 of our brief, is \"rules prescribed\nby the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.\"\nNow the advisory committee drafters may have\nthought that that subsumed rule 5, but I think that is a\nlegal question for this Court, and the correct answer to\nthat is McNabb-Mallory is a rule of supervisory power,\nnot a rule promulgated by this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McColgin, you\nhave four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. McCOLGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McCOLGIN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nRule 402 as it was enacted clearly was not\nintended to overturn existing rules of inadmissibility\nsuch as McNabb-Mallory. We know that because the\nadvisory committee notes specifically identify it as a\nrule of inadmissibility that would survive after rule\n402. It was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may not\nhave been intended to do that but doesn't its language\non its face cover that?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Not at all, because it was\nstatutorily based and it was viewed as being statutorily\nbased, because it was it was based on the existing\nstatutes at the time of McNabb which were seen as\nprecluding presentment delay. And then after the\nenactment of -- of rule 5, it was seen as based on that\nas well.\nAfter -- in 1968 Mallory was also seen as\nbeing incorporated into 3501(c) which is clear from the\ncitation in the advisory note to both Mallory and\n3501(c). So it was viewed when it was enacted as\nleaving in place McNabb-Mallory, because McNabb-Mallory\nwas viewed as being pursuant to statutory authority --\npursuant to statutory authority because it was enforcing\nstatutory rights.\nSo rule 402 clearly does not in any way\noverturn McNabb-Mallory.\nI would like to address very quickly the\nMiranda issue and note that you know, certainly,\nalthough Miranda came into effect after McNabb-Mallory,\nMiranda itself in rule 32 notes that the existence of\nthe Miranda warnings should not be seen as a basis for\ndisregarding the rights under McNabb and Mallory and the\nimportance of that exclusionary rule. So Miranda itself\nrecognized that it was still important to have a\nprotection against presentment delay, and I think the\nfacts of this case illustrate that very well.\nWe have in this case a flagrant and\ndeliberate violation of the right of prompt presentment,\nwhere the agents admitted freely that they delayed the\npresentment in order to obtain the confession. If --\nagain, if the Third Circuit were to be affirmed in this\ncase, it would be telling law enforcement around the\ncountry that that sort of flagrant conduct is\npermissible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that --\nthat sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if\nit had been done within six hours, right? Assuming it\nwas a voluntary confession?\nMR. McCOLGIN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The purpose of the\nlaw enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is\nirrelevant under six hours.\nMR. McCOLGIN: As long as it is under six\nhours, that's correct, there is no problem; and that's\nbecause within six hours there is no delay. Congress\nhas determined that anything less than six hours is not\nwithin --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't it\nseem odd that the focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as\nbeing as important as you are emphasizing, but not --\nbut totally irrelevant at 5:59?\nMR. McCOLGIN: There has to be line-drawing\nin this sort of case, so when you get close to the line,\nyou may have results that are dramatically different.\nIn this case we are far outside the line. The second\nconfession was 26 and a half hours after the arrest; and\nas I have noted and as this Court has noted, it was a\ndeliberate delay for the purpose of obtaining the\nconfessions.\nWhere we have such purposeful delay,\nCongress left McNabb-Mallory in place to address\nprecisely such flagrant conduct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you waive the right, the\n5(a) right?\nMR. McCOLGIN: Yes, Your Honor, as long as\nit is waived within the six-hour time period, and as\nlong as it is an expressed waiver of a right to prompt\npresentment, it can be waived. In this case, of course,\nthere was no waiver; there wasn't even a Miranda waiver\nuntil well -- well after the six hours.\nIf there is no further questions, thank you,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
