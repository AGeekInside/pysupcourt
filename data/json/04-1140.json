        "content": "[10:09 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument first this morning in Martin versus\nFranklin Capital Corporation.\nMr. Heldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. HELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. HELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSection 1447(c) provides for fee -- for a\nfee award -- allows a fee award when a case is\nremanded to State court. There is, by contrast, no\nstatute providing for a fee award to a defendant who\nremoves, and successfully defends against, a motion\nto remand. There is no statute providing for a fee\naward against a plaintiff who wrongly invokes the\noriginal jurisdiction in Federal District courts.\nThis indication that there is something\npeculiarly troublesome and problematic about an\nincorrect removal is borne out in the case law of\nthis Court and other courts and in the experience, I\nsubmit, of every practicing lawyer, that incorrect\nremovals have detrimental effects, both private and\nsystemic, yet Respondents would read section 1447(c)\nin a way that would leave it essentially without\npractical effect in the world of litigation. It\nwould give no -- it would not effect litigation\nbehavior to any perceptible degree. But both the\ntext of the statute, when read in context, and in\nlight of the legal landscape, and the large\nobjectives and equitable considerations at stake\nhere, weigh in favor of a standard that would, as\nthe Seventh Circuit put it, make fee awards the norm\nin cases of improper removal.\nTurning, first, to the text of the\nstatute, the statute is notable, in that, unlike\nmany fee-shifting statutes, it runs only in one\ndirection. That is to say, it allows for fees only\nwhen the case is remanded. This is a good textual\nindicium of remanding, for two reasons. First of\nall, it shows that the concern was with the\nincorrect removals, and the problems they cause in\ndeterring them, rather than a more general concern\nabout mitigation about questions of jurisdiction.\nThat is, a defendant cannot get a fee award even if\nthe plaintiff's motion to remand was not very\nstrong.\nThe second thing that the one-way nature\ntells us is that this, the statute, would be\npractically meaningless if read as the Solicitor\nGeneral suggests, and as Respondents suggest, in all\nbut a little sliver, to allow fees only when the\nremoval is unreasonable. If that would not be a\nprecise duplicate of Rule 11, it would at least be\nclose enough to a precise duplicate of Rule 11.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Rule 11 is about\nfrivolous arguments and motions, is it not?\nMR. HELDMAN: It is -- yes, Your Honor,\nthat's the shorthand of Rule 11.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. And\nChristiansburg Garment is about unreasonable\narguments. I suppose that not every unreasonable\nargument could be deemed to be a frivolous one.\nMR. HELDMAN: I would -- I agree with you,\nYour Honor, there is that -- there is a possible\nsliver of a distinction, but I -- and, I submit, any\nlawyer advising a client and any lawyer advising\nhimself or herself -- would have a hard time\ndifferentiating between the two standards, in\npractice, so as actually --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Don't you think you\nknow it when you see it?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. HELDMAN: I try to avoid all of them,\nYour Honor, the frivolous and the unreasonable,\nboth. And I think we all do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, when Congress\npassed this language, the scope of Rule 11 was not\nas well defined and understood as it is now. So,\nthe overlap argument you're making may not really go\nto what Congress had in mind.\nMR. HELDMAN: The overlap may not have\nbeen perfect, at least, among other things, in the\nsense that some courts were still under the\nmisimpression that there was a subjective element to\nRule 11, as well. So, the Solicitor General is\ncorrect in saying that there is that logically\npossible reason for the enactment of the statute, in\nthat there is not a perfect overlay. We submit\nthat, in light of the other available textual\nindicia and the policy reasons, that logically\npossible hypothesis is not the most reasonable\nhypothesis. We have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you talk\nabout the text, though -- and I understand that the\n\"may\" language here has been read by the Court in\nvery different ways, depending upon the statute --\nbut you have a statute that literally alternates\nsentences between \"shall/may,\" \"shall/may,\" and it\nseems to me that if your rule is closer to \"shall\"\nthan \"may,\" it seems that it was an odd choice of\nwords for Congress to employ.\nMR. HELDMAN: I think the reason why I\nwould disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor,\nis, we are not suggesting that it means \"shall\" in\nall instances in which a case is remanded. The rule\nwe are -- or standard we are advocating for deals\nwith that set of cases in which a plaintiff has\nsuccessfully sought remand. Now, that may\nconstitute most of the cases that are remanded, but\nthere is still the -- a separate category of cases,\nat least one -- the case is remanded sua sponte. I\ncould well envision that those would not be governed\nby a \"shall\" rule for an award of expenses and fees.\nThe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- it could be\nremanded sua sponte for any number of reasons, so --\nso, you're saying not that there is some wiggle room\nto allow \"may\" to operate, you're simply saying it\ndepends on the party that initiates the remand. And\nI guess my question is, Could you give us an\nexample, or examples, of a remand on a party's\nmotion, on a plaintiff's motion, in which the fees\nwould not be allowed?\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor. I think\nthe classic example would be if a plaintiff's\ncomplaint, for whatever reasons of negligence or\nerror, misalleges the plaintiff's State of\nresidence; thus, making the defendant reasonably\nbelieve that there is complete diversity, defendant\nremoves, plaintiff then submits affidavits and\nproperty records and everything showing it really\nwas a mistake. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\nplaintiff who waits over a year to move for remand\nwhen it appears as though the case is going in the\ndefendant's favor? Doesn't \"may\" give a district\ncourt discretion to say, \"I'm not going to reward a\nplaintiff, who wants to go back to State court only\nwhen he was on the brink of losing in Federal court,\nwith fees.\"\nMR. HELDMAN: I think, even in that\nhypothetical case, which I will say, next, is not\nthis case -- even in that hypothetical case, it is\nstill the plaintiff who has the cleanest hands of\nall. The plaintiff's hands are cleaner than those\nof the defendant --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just -- you say that\nyour presumptive fees are included would cover that\ncase. It, in part, is -- resembles your case,\nbecause you didn't move to remand until the case was\npending in the Federal District court for over a\nyear.\nMR. HELDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd if the Court would like, I could explain a\nlittle bit more about why that occurred.\nWhen the case was removed -- the\nplaintiffs in this case, unlike plaintiffs in many\ncases, did not have a preference for State court.\nThere was no attempt to plead around removal. And\nthe case was removed, and it was an arguably correct\nremoval. And plaintiffs' counsel were then in the\nposition, unfortunately, due to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, indeed, wasn't\nthere a change in the law after the case was\nremoved?\nMR. HELDMAN: There were relevant changes\nin law in some circuits, Your Honor. There was -- I\ndon't believe any dispositive change in Tenth\nCircuit law --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the Tenth\nCircuit, I thought, held that the district court was\nwithin its discretion to deny the award, because, at\nthe time of the removal, the defendants had\nobjectively reasonable grounds to believe that\nremoval was proper.\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor. And we do\nnot dispute that standard, because there were out-\nof-circuit cases, though later overruled by those\nown circuits. We've suggested that punitive damages\ncould be aggregated. And that was the -- that was\none of the bases for removal, but not the only one.\nSo, when plaintiffs removed the case,\nplaintiffs had no incentive, by virtue of 1447(c),\nin the way it had been interpreted in the Tenth\nCircuit, to make remand their first order of\nbusiness, given plaintiffs' experience that these\nbattles can be long and hard and unrewarding. And\nthe removal was arguably correct.\nNow, by a year later, that had changed.\nThat calculus of the plaintiffs' counsel had changed\nwhen defendant -- one of the defendants -- put in an\naffidavit suggesting that the named plaintiffs had\nno damages. At this point, the plaintiffs' calculus\nchanged, because there was, at this point, a very\nreal risk that if plaintiffs ignored the problem now\nand proceeded to a victory in the district court,\nthen that victory could be vacated at the\ndefendant's interest -- instance, by claiming a lack\nof jurisdiction. And this, then, was a risk that\nthe plaintiffs could not take at that point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you stated, at the\noutset -- and, I think, properly so -- that we're\ninterested in what incentives --\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- are put in place by\nwhatever rule we adopt. I'm not sure about the\nincentives in -- on the facts of this case, or in\nother cases, based on your rule. The defendant has\nonly 30 days to decide whether to remove. That's a\nFederal right that should be given some due\nconsideration. You, in effect, want to make the\nremoving defendant an insurer against improper\nremoval. And I just don't know why that should be\nthe policy.\nMR. HELDMAN: I -- my basic answer as to\nwhy that would be the policy, Your Honor, are,\nagain, the textual reasons and the large objective\nreasons. Let me go back to the -- finishing up the\ntextual reasons, if that is satisfactory.\nThe statute previously had said -- had\nincluded the word \"improvidently.\" Back when only\ncosts could be awarded, and not fees, the statute\nhad used the word \"improvidently.\" Now, many courts -\n- and I don't vouch for this interpretation, but I\nnote that it was prevalent -- many courts then said\ncosts may be awarded, or should be awarded, only\nwhen the removal was improvident, in the sense of\nbeing worse than merely incorrect. And the Congress\ndeleted that word, \"improvident\" -- \"improvidently.\"\nNow, this, I submit, is a good indication\nthat the Congress did not mean for there to be a\nstandard of \"worse than incorrectness.\" Had\nCongress meant for that to be the standard, then\nCongress would not have deleted the word that had\ngotten many courts there, or Congress would have put\nin some other textual reason.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it a big issue when\nthe provision did not provide for counsel fees?\nMR. HELDMAN: I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When it --\nMR. HELDMAN: -- Your Honor, I didn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- when the statute\nprovided for costs --\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- which, in our\nsystem, do not include counsel fees, was it a big\nissue when all that was included was costs?\nMR. HELDMAN: It was a big enough issue to\nbe the subject of comment among many courts over the\ndecades. It was a big enough issue to be covered in\nthe treatises -- the expense was not great, but it\nwas a recurring mitigated issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question? I\nnever had one of these problems when I was in\npractice, so it's all new to me. But, \"an order\nremanding the case may require payment of just costs\nand any actual expenses, including attorneys fees,\nincurred as a result of the removal,\" does that mean\nthat if, after the removal there are substantial\nproceedings in the trial court, in an appeal, and so\non, and then you suddenly discover that the -- there\nwas a mistake and you remand -- you can get fees for\nall the litigation work that took place in the\ninterim? It could be a very large sum of money,\ncouldn't it? It's not just fees incident to the\nfight over whether removal was proper.\nMR. HELDMAN: I believe that's correct,\nYour Honor. I believe that -- to me, the most\nnatural reading of that language is that the\ndistrict court, at least in the first instance, will\nhave fact-finding authority as to what fees and other\nexpenses were --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that --\nMR. HELDMAN: -- incurred as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that would --\nMR. HELDMAN: -- a result of the removal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- conceivably, could\ninclude all sorts of discovery and arguments on\nmotions and so forth that might actually save time\nin the subsequent proceeding, if it goes back to the\nState court.\nMR. HELDMAN: My anticipation would be\nthat most courts would use their factfinding\nauthority to try to figure out what work would have\nto be reduplicated in the State court, to\ncompensate that work, or the work that only arose by\nvirtue of it being in Federal court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, the judge's\ndiscretion includes both whether or not to include\nany fees, and he also has quite a bit of discretion\non what to include in the fee award, I suppose.\nMR. HELDMAN: I think that's right, Your\nHonor. Whether you call it \"discretion\" or\n\"factfinding authority,\" I think that's right. That\nis a separate question from what we have here. But\nI think the district court would have the first-line\nauthority and the main --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --\nMR. HELDMAN: -- authority.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- shouldn't we know\nwhat the rule is with reference to the extensive\nfees Justice Stevens requires? Shouldn't we know\nthat, as part of the background for what we're going\nto do in this case? And if you say -- and you seem\nto indicate, \"Well, it's going to be up to the\ndiscretion of the judge.\" Well, if we know what the\nrule is, then it's not part of the discretion.\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor. I've proposed\nwhat I suggest would be the standard, which is,\ngoing back to the text, \"what expenses were incurred\nas a result of,\" and I think that naturally means\n\"what were in -- what costs and fees were incurred\nthat would not have been recur -- incurred, or would\nnot have been incurred again, had the case been left\nin State court.\" Now I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why doesn't -- why\ndoesn't that also go for counsel fees? I mean,\nthere are expenses in discovery, but there --\nthere's counsel time in discovery. So, wouldn't the\nsame rule apply?\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor, that is --\nthat is what I'm suggesting, that the same rule\nwould apply. Now, I would add --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know what it is\nyou're arguing for. That is, I -- when I get\nthrough all these words in the attorneys-fees cases,\nI've got it in my mind that, like the civil rights\nstatute, they say, \"You normally get fees, unless\nyou shouldn't.\" All right? That means you're\nnormally gonna to get them.\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The plaintiff, anyway.\nAll right? Then we have a case with a copyright.\nThe copyright says it's all the way up to the\ndistrict court, really, which means a grab-bag, and\nwhat the particular judge thinks is fair in the\ninstance. And I guess you could have a rule saying,\n\"You hardly ever get fees.\" So, in my mind, I got\nit, \"Well, who knows?\" and, \"No, you almost always\ndo,\" or, \"No, you almost always don't.\" Now, is\nthat a good characterization? And what -- which one\nof those three are you arguing for?\nMR. HELDMAN: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you're not arguing\nfor \"You always don't.\"\n[Laughter.]\nMR. HELDMAN: I think that is a good\ncharacterization, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then, which\none do you want? Do you want the thing --\nMR. HELDMAN: Of those three --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HELDMAN: -- Your Honor, we would\nprefer the \"almost always.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if you\nwant \"you always get them,\" in the civil liberties\ncases there is a good policy reason, according to\nthe court, underlying that judgment of how Congress\nwanted to give this to people to vindicate civil\nliberties. I've never heard of a policy of closing\nthe Federal court door, because if, in fact, you\nwere to have that rule in this case, it would simply\ndiscourage people from removing it in cases where\nthey think they have a good claim to remove it,\nbecause they'd have to pay huge costs if they were\nwrong. So, I'm not aware of any closing doors of\nFederal court policy.\nMR. HELDMAN: First of all, Your Honor, I\nwould suggest that it is not we who would close the\ndoors of Federal court. It is, by definition in\nthese cases, the Congress that has closed the doors\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now I --\nMR. HELDMAN: -- Federal court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- unfortunately, I\nguess, from your position, I don't know what\nCongress meant here.\nMR. HELDMAN: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Therefore, I'm trying to\nfigure it out in terms of the policy --\nMR. HELDMAN: Yes, Your Honor. I'm --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- as well as the\nlanguage. Okay, in terms of the policy, I'm simply\nsaying that I don't know why you have a better claim\nthan a copyright plaintiff, and I can think of why\nyou don't have as good a claim as a civil rights\nplaintiff, the reason I said. So, what is your\nresponse to that?\nMR. HELDMAN: First of all, Your Honor, I\napologize for not being clear enough. When I say it\nis not we, but the Congress, that has closed the\ndoors of the Federal court, I mean on the\nsubstantive question of whether the case was\nremovable. We are dealing here, only by definition,\nwith the cases that were incorrectly removed. So,\nthe real question, I think, when we get down to the\npolicies, is, there is some concern that defendants,\nunder the rule I propose, would have an incentive to\nremove somewhat fewer cases. They would reserve the\nquestionable removals only for the cases in which\nthey could convince themselves and their clients\nthat the argument was good enough, and the stakes\nhigh enough, to justify the cost.\nNow, I submit to you, that's exactly the\nsame sort of situation we have now. It is merely\nthat, now, when making that cost-benefit analysis,\nthe defendant is thinking only of its own fees that\nit will incur. But, still, that is a cost. And the\nCongress, notably, has not seen fit to alleviate\nthat cost at all. So, some questionable removals\nare already deterred by expense under the rule I\npropose; some, more would be. On the same -- by the\nsame token, the rule I propose would give good\nincentives to the plaintiffs' lawyers to be aware of\nthe jurisdictional issues, to mitigate them, and\nmitigate them well.\nNow, why do I suggest to you that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Under your rule,\nthere's a presumption. I thought that the rule\nyou're asking us to approve is the one that's\napplicable in the Seventh Circuit, which is that you\npresume there will be counsel fees when a case is\nremanded to the State court, unless there are\nextraordinary circumstances that would overcome the\npresumption. Now, that's what you're -- that's the\nrule you're asking for?\nMR. HELDMAN: I don't know, Your Honor,\nwhether the Seventh Circuit would follow up its\npresumption language by saying the presumption can\nonly be overcome in extraordinary circumstances.\nThat is, I don't know whether the Seventh Circuit\nsees its standard as the Piggie Park standard or as\nsomething slightly towards the middle from the\nPiggie Park standard. I think, in this case, we\nwould win either way, but I would suggest that there\nis a systemic benefit from not having a multiplicity\nof standards, from having at least most attorneys-\nfee-shifting disputes be resolvable by, is it\n\"almost always,\" is it \"who knows,\" or is it \"never,\nunless unreasonable\"?\nI think there's a benefit to having\nnessatavite litigation over --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's such a\ndifferent in the context. The Title VII plaintiff\ngets fees after a defendant has been found a law-\nviolator. And, here, a defendant has a right to\naccess to a Federal court. And the statute -- you\nare emphasizing text. If one looks at the Omnibus\nAct out of which this provision came, we see two\nremoval-friendly pieces in it, right? Because, no\nlonger do you have to verify a removal petition; you\njust do a simple notice. And that's one. And there\nwas another. Oh, yes. Yes, you don't have to put up\na bond anymore if you want to remove.\nMR. HELDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nRather than characterizing those as \"removal-\nfriendly,\" I would characterize them as \"resource-\nfriendly.\" I think all of this can be -- can be\nunderstood as a congressional effort, overall, to\nreduce the amount of resources that are put into\njurisdictional issues. And the rule we're proposing\nwould further that goal; that is, by somewhat\ndeterring the, by definition, incorrect removal.\nNow, on -- every incorrect removal not\nonly harms the plaintiff -- harms the plaintiff a\ngood bit -- the delay, the expense -- And there's\nbeen some concern I've heard voiced about the great\nexpense that this might impose on defendants -- it\nimposes a great expense on defendants only precisely\nin as much as the defendant has imposed a great\nexpense on the plaintiff by its incorrect action.\nNow, it is true that fees --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's a\ngeneral -- you're -- you seem to be arguing more\ngenerally for the British rule, rather than the\nAmerican rule. And I read our decision in Fogerty\nto say that when we're confronted with language like\nthis, \"may,\" you don't assume that Congress intended\nto overrule the basic American rule and apply the\nBritish one.\nMR. HELDMAN: In that aspect of Fogerty,\nYour Honor, the Court had already gotten to the\npoint of saying, \"The standard is the same for\nprevailing plaintiff and prevailing defendant.\" And\nthen, in the -- in the passage we're talking about,\nthe Court was looking at the \"one size\" argument.\nOkay. And that same standard for both should be\n\"usually\" or \"nearly always.\" And it was in that\ncontext, in which there would be a \"shall\" or\n\"nearly always,\" running both ways, that the Court\nsaid, \"That would be a rare bird in American law,\"\nthe \"both ways\" British rule that -- which is my\nunderstanding of the British rule -- \"That's such a\nrare bird, we would want to see some clearer\nindication of that.\"\nIn this case, I submit, we don't have a\nrare bird at all. It is not unusual to have a -- to\nhave \"may\" interpreted in a statute as meaning\n\"usually should,\" in some class of cases. Piggie\nPark did it. Many cases in other contexts,\nfollowing Piggie Park. So, it's not such a rare\nbird.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those were all\nthe, you know, private attorneys-general-type cases,\nwhere you're -- where the view is that the plaintiff\nis carrying out a mission of ferreting out and\nenforcing the law. But that's -- this is a quite\ndifferent context.\nMR. HELDMAN: I don't think so, Your\nHonor, because, first of all, it is true that\nusually you're awarding fees against a violator of\nFederal law. But that is because most fee statutes\ninvolve Federal causes of action. This is unusual\nand notable, in that it is a fee-shifting statute\nfor a procedural violation. Therefore, to say,\n\"Yes, but they didn't violate Federal law,\" proves\ntoo much, I think. And so, we shouldn't make such a\ndistinction between the private attorney-general\ncases and this case, because the plaintiff -- every\nplaintiff who successfully seeks remand is\nfurthering systemic values, as well as the\nplaintiff's own values, is furthering the value of\ncomity, federalism, State sovereignty, the Federal\ndocket load, and helping to avoid the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Every party who\nprevails on a motion to admit evidence or to exclude\nevidence is promoting the policies and the rules of\nevidence, but we don't think that those motions\nshould result in a -- in fee shifting.\nMR. HELDMAN: That is largely because,\nYour Honor, the Congress does not pass statutes\nallowing for fee shifting. And, second, removal is\ndifferent. Removal has federalism concerns, as this\nCourt has noted, going back into the '40s. Removal\n-- jurisdiction being an unwaivable thing, these\ncases -- wrong removal possibly leading to the\ndisaster in which the case goes to trial in Federal\ncourt, judgment is entered, and it has to be vacated\non appeal and done all over again, because nobody\nrecognized the jurisdictional issue. By encouraging\nplaintiffs to challenge these more effectively, and\nby encouraging defendants to reserve their\nquestionable efforts only for the cases that really\ndeserve it, I think we would be -- we would be\nserving public ends, as well as private ones.\nNow, I would love to reserve the remainder\nof my time, unless there are further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nHeldman.\nMR. HELDMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Chilton, we'll\nhear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN T. CHILTON\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. CHILTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSince the first Judiciary Act of 1789,\nCongress has given defendants the right to remove\ncases to Federal court. Respondents did so properly\nin this case, and there's no dispute about that.\nThe -- both lower courts found that we had\nreasonable grounds for removal, on two bases --\nbased on the only circuit court decisions then\nextant on aggregating punitive damages and attorneys\nfees. Petitioners conceded that fact here this\nmorning and also in the trial court, district court,\nbefore they moved to remand, a year after removal\nand after the district court in the same hearing had\nindicated its tentative decision to rule against\nthem on the merits of a dismissal motion.\nSo, the issue before the Court today is\nwhether 1447(c) requires a district court to impose\na substantial penalty in the form of attorneys fees\non Respondents for what is concededly in this case a\nreasonable, but ultimately unsuccessful, exercise of\ntheir statutory right to remove.\nAnd we think the answer to that answer to\nthat question is clearly no, for two reasons. The\nfirst is that Section 1447(c) is not a fee-shifting\nstatute at all. Like its predecessor, Section 5 of\nthe Act of March 3, 1875, Section 1447(c) just\nconfirms the district court's power to award fees,\nas well as costs, when it lacks subject-matter\njurisdiction and, therefore, must remand the case.\nThere was a prior contrary common-law rule, and the\nAct of March 3, 1875 abrogated it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that it\nallows Rule 11 fees to be imposed --\nMR. CHILTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which otherwise\nwouldn't be imposable. It seems to me that what\ncuts against that interpretation is the fact that it\ndoes try to set some standard. It says, \"An order\nremanding the case may require payment of just cause\n-- just costs and any actual expenses, including\nattorneys fees.\" Especially the \"just costs,\"\nthat's a standard. It's not saying, \"You can use\nRule 11 and apply whatever standard Rule 11\ncontains.\" What's your response to that?\nMR. CHILTON: My response would be that,\nas the questioning already today in the Court has\nrevealed, there are two questions on a fee motion.\nOne is entitlement, the other is amount. \"Just\ncosts\" refers to amount, not entitlement.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But I'm -- I don't --\nI'm not sure that I agree with you that Rule 11\napplies. It really deals with frivolous actions.\nAnd here, we're talking about the imposition of\nreasonable costs, are we not? Just costs.\nMR. CHILTON: Just costs and expenses,\nincluding attorneys fees, yes. It is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I think the standard is\ndifferent than that, under Rule 11.\nMR. CHILTON: Well, if the Court\ninterprets --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, why --\nMR. CHILTON: You --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- is it in your\ninterest to ask us to apply Rule 11? You're hoping\nthat, in future cases, it will be less likely that\nthese are awarded?\nMR. CHILTON: Well, we're proposing our\nfirst argument, because we think it's textually\ncorrect and historically correct. It leads to the\nsame result, in our case, a point I was about to\nmake. Our second argument is that, even if you\nconstrue this statute as a fee-shifting statute, the\nstandard under the fee-shifting statute should be\nthe one that Your Honor just mentioned, which is,\nit's a multifactor test, but the primary factor is\nwhether the ground for removal is objectively\nreasonable. And under that standard, we win.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, the Solicitor\nGeneral, I guess, suggests that the Christiansburg\nGarment standard is the appropriate one.\nMR. CHILTON: That is true, he does.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do you disagree\nwith that?\nMR. CHILTON: Well, our two standards, I\nbelieve, are relatively close. We both focus on the\nobjective reasonableness of the removal. Now, the\nSolicitor General, I believe, is a little bit less -\n- leaves a little bit less discretion to the\ndistrict court than we would. We believe that\nCongress, in using the word \"may,\" in using, if you\nwanted to look at this as a fee-shifting statute,\nthe word \"just,\" meant to leave district courts with\nconsiderable range of discretion to deal with cases\nthat come up that are unusual in the way a party can\n\"game the system,\" if you will, in respect to\nremoval. For example, in this case, waiting as long\nas the plaintiff did before seeking a remand.\nObviously a plaintiff --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but there had\nbeen case-law changes, hadn't there?\nMR. CHILTON: There had been, but that was\nnot the reason for their delayed motion for remand.\nAs they explained in the trial court, the reason\nthey suddenly became aware, supposedly, of the right\nto remand was this declaration saying that they, the\nplaintiffs, hadn't paid any money for collateral\nprotection insurance, a fact of which they must have\nbeen aware at the time they filed their complaint.\nFurthermore, in the Tenth Circuit, you cannot look\nto any document, other than the complaint or notice\nof removal, to establish the facts for removal\njurisdiction. Therefore, the declaration could not\npossibly have justified a motion to remand.\nBut, in any case, my more general point,\napart from the facts of this case, is that there are\ncases in which one party or the other uses remand to\nbasically avoid a -- an adverse decision on the\nsubstance, and when that party does, whether it's\nthe defendant or the plaintiff, we feel that the\ndistrict court ought to have discretion to award\nfees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought a\ncomparative advantage of the Solicitor General's\napproach, and, by the same token, of the\nPetitioner's contrary approach, is that it avoids a\nlot of litigation over a collateral issue, like\nwhich court you ought to be in. As soon as you get\ninto a multifactor analysis, then you get briefs on\nboth sides arguing their factors and the other\nside's factors, and the judge has to decide. If\nthere's a presumption that applies in most cases,\nyou don't waste time over jurisdictional squabbles\nlike this.\nMR. CHILTON: Well, first you have the\njurisdictional dispute, of course, resolved. It's\nonly when there's a remand that you get to the fee\nissue. But, your more general point is, yes,\nobviously a categorical rule will have less\nlitigation than a multifactor test. The question\nis, What did Congress want? -- not, What will reduce\nlitigation costs? And we believe Congress would\nhave wanted, in this situation, and did want, to\nallow for discretion to be exercised. Now, it's a\nlimited discretion under our test, because if -- in\ngeneral, if the removal is objectively reasonable,\nas ours was, we believe Congress would not have\nallowed an award of fees, except in those\ncircumstances, as I've mentioned, where the system\nis being gamed by one party or another.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's hard to have three\ndifferent kinds of standards with attorneys-fees\nstatutes. I mean, there are quite a few of them,\nand -- I can understand saying some of those\nstatutes mean you almost always should get it,\nbecause of special policies reflected in the history\nof the statute, et cetera. That's Christianson.\nAnd I can imagine Fogerty, where you say, \"As to an\nordinary one, it's ordinary.\" \"Ordinary\" means it's\nup to the discretion of the district judge. And\nthere may be many reasons. Do we want a third one,\nwhere --\nMR. CHILTON: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- let's say they pass\nthis -- and it's \"unusual\"? I mean, we're going to\nget several categorizations and shadings of\nstatutes. I don't have an answer. I'm not\nsuggesting a point of view on this. I'm curious\nwhat you think.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I --\nMR. CHILTON: No --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- think we do have\nthree, if you count Fogerty, because you have the\nChristianson, which is the most defendant-friendly.\nAnd then you have Piggie Park, which is the most\nplaintiff-friendly. And then you have Fogerty,\nwhich is been -- has been called the multifactor --\nMR. CHILTON: You're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- test.\nMR. CHILTON: -- quite correct, in our\nview, Justice Ginsburg. We believe Petitioners are\nrequesting the Piggie Park standard. We believe the\nSolicitor General is proposing the Christiansburg\nGarment standard. And we think we're smack in the\nmiddle, with Fogerty. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, it would really\nimprove the dignity of this Court if we referred to\n\"Piggie Park\" as \"Newman.\"\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CHILTON: I have no response to that\nremark, Your Honor.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CHILTON: To pick up the train of my\nargument --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CHILTON: -- we believe that\ndiscretion is not only the better part of valor, but\nwhat Congress enacted in this statute. And that's\nwhat Fogerty said -- \"may\" means \"may,\" it doesn't\nmean \"must\" -- it connotes discretion -- and that an\nautomatic rule for the award of fees on remand, or\neven the contrary rule, would pretermit that\ndiscretion, so that when, as in this case, there are\nnot overriding public-policy -- public policies that\nare enforced by one party -- for example, in the\ncivil rights cases, where it is the plaintiff who is\nthe private attorney general enforcing what this\nCourt has said, or Congress's most important\npolicies -- when that's not present, as in this\ncase, then \"may\" means \"may.\" Particularly, that's\nso when, as in this case, the defendant is not a\nviolator of Federal law, has done nothing that\nimpinges or removes rights from the defendant -- or,\nexcuse me, the plaintiff -- but, in fact, serves\nFederal interest in seeking removal. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that one could\nassume that to be the congressional intent, if\nCongress often has such an intent for such\nsubstantial imposition of financial liability. Do\nyou have any other examples of where Congress has\nessentially left it up to the district judge, with a\nbroad, virtually nonreviewable -- I guess it's\nreviewable, but -- to some extent -- but multifactor\ntest, whatever the district judge considers\nimportant?\nMR. CHILTON: Yes, Your Honor, I do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are --\nMR. CHILTON: -- as a matter of fact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what are some other\nexamples where Congress has allowed this degree of\nfinancial liability to be subjected to the\ndiscretion of a district judge?\nMR. CHILTON: The Freedom of Information\nAct, Your Honor, which was passed in 1974, which,\ninterestingly, I think, undermines the Petitioner's\nargument that, in using the word \"may,\" Congress\nsomehow incorporated the \"Newman\" standard.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CHILTON: The -- in 1974, in adopting\nthe Freedom of Information Act, Congress\nspecifically considered adopting -- and it was in\nthe Senate bill -- a four-factor test. It was\nremoved from the bill, and the -- both conference\nreports on that bill explained that it was removed\nnot to require a district court to award fees\nautomatically in any case, but, rather, because the\nexisting law was following, in fact, a multifactor\nanalysis, and Congress wished to preserve it and\nfelt that the four-factor test, which had been in\nthe Senate bill, was too restrictive.\nNow, there is another example, as well, in\nthe -- in ERISA. The cases under ERISA -- other\nthan the special case of trust funds seeking\ndelinquent contributions from employers; those are\ntreated differently -- but for cases simply of\nsuits by trustees against beneficiaries,\nbeneficiaries against employers, beneficiaries\nagainst trustees, the courts have, in fact, employed\na multifactor test.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this is liability for\nwhat? In -- for --\nMR. CHILTON: Denying benefits, for\nexample.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't Fogerty an\nexample. Isn't the -- what is the standard that\nFogerty announces? It rejects the British rule, and\nthat it rejects the one favoring -- one party over\nthe other? What is the standard you get out of\nFogerty, other than pure discretion of the district\ncourt?\nMR. CHILTON: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nit's not pure discretion. The footnote at the end\nof the opinion says that district courts may follow\nthe Third Circuit standard, looking first at whether\nthe argument of the losing party was frivolous,\nunreasonable, et cetera, and then looking at other\nfactors that are indicated by the particular\nconcerns of the Copyright Act. And, yes, I quite --\nyou're, of course, right that the -- Fogerty did\nadopt the multifactor test under the Copyright Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as it was just\nmentioned, \"multifactor,\" in a footnote, it said it\nwould be neutral. I think the big point in Fogerty\nwas that it was going to apply in both directions,\nbe neutral as between plaintiff and defendant.\nMR. CHILTON: That much is true, but the\nfootnote does say that, in applying the neutral\nstandard, the district courts are free to follow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You've given us, in\nyour multifactor test, you said, \"objectively\nreasonable basis to remove.\" And another factor\nmight be that the plaintiff delayed in moving to\nremand. What other factors, besides the\n\"objectively reasonable basis to remove\" and the\nplaintiff's delay?\nMR. CHILTON: Well, we outlined several in\nour brief, Your Honor, at page -- let me see -- page\n41. In addition, I think the case of Gardner versus\nAllstate Indemnity, 147 F.2d 1257 indicates another.\nThere, the defendant moved successfully to remand\nafter receiving a -- an adverse decision on the\nmerits. It may have had an objectively reasonable\nground for removal. In that case, it actually\ndidn't, but, I mean, you can conceive of a situation\nin which they would have had one. And, obviously,\nafter the merits decision went against it, it wanted\na second chance. Now, in that situation, I believe\na district court might, despite the objectively\nreasonable basis for removal, decide that the\ndefendant should pay costs and fees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your\nposition on what fees we're talking about. Do you\nagree with your friend that money that's spent,\nthat's going to have to be spent anyway in the State\ncourt proceeding, though, is not wasted, that that's\nnot recoverable?\nMR. CHILTON: I absolutely do not agree,\nYour Honor. I think that \"incurred by reason of the\nremoval\" refers to fees and costs that are\nspecifically directed to the jurisdictional issue,\nand that only; no other fees or costs in the\nlitigation at all. Of course, that question isn't\npresented here, because we had no -- or the lower\ncourts decided that -- the Petitioner is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have the lower courts\naddressed that issue?\nMR. CHILTON: Not to my knowledge, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there -- are there\ninstances, under your view of the statute, in --\nunder the standard you propose, where costs would be\nawarded, but not fees?\nMR. CHILTON: Well, if you view 1447(c) as\nan -- a power-enabling bill, not a fee-shifting\nstatute, the answer is yes. I believe if the -- if\nit's viewed as a fee-shifting statute, the answer\nwould be no, although, of course, the court has\ndiscretion to decide how much to award, and, in that\nsense, could award either no fees and all costs, or\nsome --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And, once --\nMR. CHILTON: -- combination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- again, can you advise\nus of their practice or lower-court opinions\naddressing that issue?\nMR. CHILTON: I cannot, but there\ncertainly are lower-court decisions that allow fees\non remand in very small amounts that could not\npossibly have been sufficient to compensate for the\nwork done.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because we think of\ncosts as really a matter of course. As Justice\nScalia points out, it says \"just costs,\" which -- I\ntake it \"just\" modifies just the cost and not the\nactual --\nMR. CHILTON: Well, as the statute is\nwritten, that's true.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I return to Fogerty\nfor a minute? As I read the footnote at the end of\nthe opinion, which you - because say referred to the\nThird Circuit rule, it talks about, \"nonexclusive\nfactors are permissible.\" It doesn't say the factors\nused by the Third Circuit are the -- you know, set any\nparticular standard. As I read it, it leaves the\ndiscretion entirely up to the district court to\napply whatever reasonable and appropriate factors\nseem correct in the particular case.\nMR. CHILTON: Well, that may be, Your\nHonor. I read the decision, and perhaps --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're --\nMR. CHILTON: -- incorrectly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but you're --\nMR. CHILTON: -- as steer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the part of the\ndecision on which you rely is the footnote at the\nend of the opinion, is that right?\nMR. CHILTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the -- the broader\ndiscretion we give to the district court, the less\nlitigation there is likely to be on this subject.\nMR. CHILTON: That is certainly true.\nFewer appeals, at any rate. And as long as we're\ntalking about litigation expense, I think, to bring\nus back to one of Petitioner's arguments, they\ncontend that their standard would reduce the amount\nof costs invested in jurisdictional issues. But, in\nthe same breath, they also say that the standard\nthat they propose would encourage plaintiffs to move\nfor remand. The two cannot coexist. If -- not\nevery remand motion is meritorious. So, by\nencouraging plaintiffs to move for remands, you're,\nin fact, increasing the amount of jurisdictional\nlitigation and the amount of costs incurred at --\nover jurisdictional issues.\nI wanted, if I could, to answer one\nquestion that Justice Ginsburg asked in the\nbeginning about the Omnibus Act. Justice Ginsburg\nmentioned that it contained removal-friendly\nprovisions. And it does. They're not only the two\nthat were mentioned -- lack of -- or abolition of\nthe verification doctrine and deletion of the\nremoval bond -- but much more significant expansions\nof removal jurisdiction. The -- for us from\nCalifornia, in particular, the 1988 Act said that\nyou could disregard the citizenship of \"Doe,\" or\nfictitiously named, defendants in deciding whether\nthere was diversity -- complete diversity in a case.\nThat was huge for us in California, because\nvirtually every State court complaint in California\ncontains \"Doe\" defendants. And prior to that\namendment, their citizen -- you had to guess at\ntheir citizenship, and it prevented removal of\nvirtually all State court complaints, on diversity\ngrounds. So, to say that this 1988 Act was designed\nto discourage removals plainly goes against the text\nof the Act.\nFurthermore, removal furthers not only the\nprivate interest of the defendant, but the\nGovernment's interest, the Federal interest, the\ninterest of the people of the United States, in many\ncases. And that's precisely why Congress has given\nus the right to remove in a whole series of areas,\nnot only in diversity, but, of course, in Federal\nquestion. An interesting example, because it arose\nfor the first time in 1875, in the same Act of March\n3, 1875, from which this cost provision comes, an\nAct that was passed by the lame-duck radical\nRepublicans at the same time they passed the Civil\nRights Act of 1875, for the purpose of allowing\nFederal courts to enforce the new Federal rights\nthat Congress felt were not being adequately\naddressed in State courts. So, the State courts,\nparticularly the South, were thought to be hostile\nto the new Federal rights.\nSimilarly, just this year, in the Class\nAction Fairness Act, Congress allowed defendants to\nremove multi-State class actions, not for the\nbenefit of the defendants, but for the benefit of\nthe entire Nation. It -- the Senate report, at page\n9, specifically points out that it is those cases\nwhich most affect the interstate commerce of this\nNation, and, for that reason, they belong in Federal\ncourt. Now, why would Congress choose to discourage\ndefendants from removing those very cases by\nadopting a plaintiff-friendly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not\nthose very cases. By definition, this issue only\ncomes up when the case should not have been removed.\nMR. CHILTON: The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's not the\ncases that Congress wanted to be removed that we're\ntalking about.\nMR. CHILTON: But, as this Court explained\nin Piggie -- no, excuse me, Christiansburg Garment,\nYour Honor-- the imposition of fees discourages\nactivity when it's a Federal right that's being\nenforced, saying that fees are imposed whenever\nthere's a near miss, a reasonable case that's\nbrought to enforce the Federal right. You\ndiscourage the very thing that Congress intended\npeople to enforce. That's my point here.\nYes, it's true, fees would only be awarded\nin those cases where the defendant is unsuccessful\nand the case is remanded. But, for example, in the\nClass Action Fairness Act, that can happen even when\nthere's a perfectly, not just reasonable, but\nexactly proper ground of removal, because the Class\nAction Fairness Act, among other things, says that\nwhen there's more than one-third, and less than two-\nthirds, the citizens in the State in which the\ncomplaint was originally filed, they're in the\nclass, then the district court has discretion to\nremand the case, even if it's properly brought in\nFederal court, removed to Federal court.\nSo, my general point is that Congress has\nenacted these removal statutes to promote Federal\npolicy, and that it would be counter to that policy\nto discourage defendants from removing cases,\nparticularly if the amount of fees that could be\nawarded would include all the fees incurred in\nFederal court. I mean, we're talking about very\nsubstantial fee awards, in that event. And they\nwould be a significant deterrent from exercising the\nvery rights that Congress has said defendants should\nhave for the benefit of the public.\nFurthermore, as already pointed out, State\ncourt plaintiffs never enforce congressional policy;\notherwise, they'd be in Federal court, under\nFederal-question jurisdiction. The defendant has\nnot violated Federal law, so neither of the\nexceptional circumstances --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I wonder if that's a\ncorrect statement. It seems to me there are a lot\nof cases in State courts. In 1983, cases are\nsubject to State court jurisdiction, where the\nplaintiffs are trying to enforce a Federal right.\nMR. CHILTON: Yes, but those can be\nremoved, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, I just thought you said\nthe State court would never be enforcing a Federal -\n- I may --\nMR. CHILTON: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I may have\nmisunderstood your point --\nMR. CHILTON: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I'm sorry.\nMR. CHILTON: -- I, perhaps, was\novergeneralizing. What I meant to say was, in cases\nthat are remanded because of lack of Federal\njurisdiction, it is never the case that the\nplaintiff is enforcing a Federal right, because, if\nhe were, there would be Federal-question\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, it was\nan improperly removed case.\nMR. CHILTON: That's right.\nIn any event, if the Court has no further\nquestions, I am through.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nCounsel.\nMr. Heldman, you have four and a half\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. HELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. HELDMAN: First, regarding the\ncontinued insinuation of some manipulative intent by\nthe timing of the -- of the removal, there was, in\nthis case, no finding by the district court, no\nsuggestion by the district court, that there was any\nsuch intent, or that that was a reason to deny fees,\nno suggestion by either of the lower courts to that\neffect. Absent that, I think it might be that a\ndelay in removal could, in an appropriate case, be\nsomething that went into the calculus of what\nexpenses and fees were incurred as a result of the\nremoval. That may well go into the \"amount\"\nquestion. But, absent a manipulative intent, it is\nstill the case that it is the plaintiff who\nsuccessfully sought remand, whenever it happened,\nthat has the cleanest hands in the courtroom.\nSecond, Respondents describe their\nproposal as a middle ground. There is no middle\nground in this case, unless it is, \"Eh, who knows?\"\nTheir proposal is not middle ground, because their\nproposal says, \"There shall be no award of fees, in\ngeneral,\" as the most important factor, where there\nwas a reasonable basis for removal. That cannot be\ndescribed as a middle ground. That tilts it in one\nway. We tilt it in the other way. And, as I say, a\nmiddle ground only gets you perhaps to Fogerty. And\nit -- and, as we show on page 30 of our blue brief,\nin the footnote, the district -- there has been a\nlot of litigation, after Fogerty, still trying to\nfigure out what the standard is -- not only district\ncourt litigation, but appellate litigation, and the\ncircuits are all over the map as to even what the\ncopyrights standard is. I urge the Court, for the\nbenefit of the practicing bar, as well as the bench,\nnot to go down that road.\nNow, the road made some sense in Fogerty,\nand multifactor tests makes some sense in the --\nFOIA and ERISA, because, in those instances, there\nare very weighty public interests on both sides of\nthe litigation. When an ERISA claimant sues the\nERISA fund, it's not a -- it's not that one is the\nparticular favorite of the law; they are both\nfavorites ---\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --\nMR. HELDMAN: -- of the law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not, then, just say\n\"objectively reasonable basis to remove\"? That's a\none -- one standard.\nMR. HELDMAN: That standard is\nappropriate, as in Christiansburg, Your Honor, where\nthe party who is potentially subject to the award is\nthe favorite of the law in question. That is, where\nthere is a special reason not to seek to over-deter\nthat person, to encourage that person to litigate\ncreatively and aggressively the reasonable, though\nultimately wrong, propositions. And so, I think the\ncase reduces, in a large sense, to: Does Federal\nlaw encourage the creative aggressive litigation of\nquestionable removals? And among the ways we know\nthat it does not is that this Court has said, for\n60-something years, that removal is strictly\nconstrued, as every circuit has understood that to\nmean. That means doubts are resolved in favor of\nremand. If Congress wanted to encourage the removal\nof questionable cases and get it all hashed out and\nmake the defendants -- they would, first of all,\nabrogate that rule, and, second, they would remove\nthe rule in Section 1447(d) precluding reviews of\nremand orders. Because as we have it now, except\nfor special cases where the Congress decides\notherwise, like the recent Class Action Act, where\nwe have, otherwise, the substantive law is bent\ntowards remand, bent against the creative and\naggressive advocacy of perfectly reasonable, but\nwrong, propositions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law was so anti-\nremoval, then one would expect there would be some\nkind of threshold check once you get to district\ncourt. But the removal process is: you file your\nnotice that you're removing. That's it. There it\ngoes. And the district court doesn't do any kind of\ninitial screening to let it in. It just gets there\n--\nMR. HELDMAN: My experience --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- by rapid transit.\nMR. HELDMAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. My\nexperience in the district courts is that they do do\nan initial screening, as they should, in order to\nlimit themselves on their own motion to their own\nproper jurisdiction. This court, unfortunately --\nthe district court -- did not. But my experience in\nthe district courts is that some of them do, but a\nlot of -- at least a substantial number of cases\nslip through the cracks.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nCounsel.\nMR. HELDMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n[Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
