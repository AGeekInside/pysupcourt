        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 00-853, Porter v. Nussle.\nGeneral Blumenthal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case is about the meaning of the term,\nprison conditions, and the reason it is here is because\nthe Second Circuit misinterpreted that term contrary to\nthe purposes of Congress and the meaning given that term\nby this Court.\nIn fact, Congress adopted this Court's language\nwhen it passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996\nand adopted the meaning of that term given to it by this\nCourt in a line of cases, Preiser v. Rodriguez, the\nBronson case, McCarthy v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter,\nthat very clearly include single episode and excessive\nforce cases, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals\nexcluded in its decision. It interpreted the term, prison\nconditions, to exclude those kinds of single episode and\nexcessive forces instances of misconduct by prison\nofficials.\nQUESTION: What's the universe of conditions and\nnonconditions that you would suggest? There was\nconsiderable discussion in the brief about the distinction\nbetween 1983 suits and habeas corpus suits. You would not\ndraw the line there, would you, or would you?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Preiser v. Rodriguez draws\nthe line between habeas corpus petitions on the one hand\nchallenging the fact or duration of confinement and the on\nthe other hand conditions of prison life, or conditions of\nhis prison life, as it refers to the petitions that we\nthink are the universe that would be included in 1983\nactions. Virtually any conditions of prison life ought to\nbe regarded as conditions of confinement cases.\nQUESTION: Well, can you give me an example,\nunder your theory, of a case that is not covered by habeas\ncorpus, but that also are not a condition of prison life\nwhich is a 1983 suit? When could a 1983 suit lie under\nyour theory?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Our position would be that\nall of those 183 lawsuits ought to be subject, are subject\nto the exhaustion requirement. There are no exclusions,\nwhether it's --\nQUESTION: You can't think of any suit brought\nby a prisoner that is not controlled by the term,\nconditions, unless it's a habeas corpus suit?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Well, if it were completely\nunrelated to prison life -- an example might be, for\nexample, a lawsuit against a State tax commissioner, for\nexample, just to take one that seems relevant in light of\nthe earlier argument today, where the prisoner is claiming\nthat he's been denied a refund to which he's properly\nentitled, and --\nQUESTION: You're saying that all Eighth\nAmendment claims under 1983, which is what most of the\nprison cases are.\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: All --\nQUESTION: They claim that they've been deprived\nof a constitutional right because they have been sentenced\nto prison and the conditions of that prison, whether it's\nan isolated beating by a guard or anything else, are\nunduly -- are cruel and unusual?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Yes, Justice Scalia. All\nEighth Amendment constitutional claims, indeed all\nconstitutional claims under 1983, this Court has never\nestablished a hierarchy among such claims regarding\nexcessive force claims as deserving greater priority, so\nthat they ought to be spared the exhaustion requirement.\nIn fact, it is specifically said in Wilson v.\nGarcia that, for example, on statute of limitations\nquestions there ought to be uniformity, and certainty, so\nas to avoid the kind of litigation that also was the\npurpose of Congress in passing the PLRA, and that is\nreally one of the key points here.\nQUESTION: That's an easier line. What you're\nsaying is that the minute you begin defining a universe of\nconditions which is smaller than the 1983 suits --\ngenerally we have a whole jurisprudence that has to be\ntested and create satellite litigation, et cetera, and I\nunderstand that. I'm just wondering if your definition is\nprevailing, Congress would have used those words,\nconditions. It would have just said all 1983 suits\ninvolving prisoners, period.\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Justice Kennedy, Congress\nused that term because it was used by this Court to\ndescribe a category of the universe as set forth in\nPreiser and again in McCarthy v. Bronson, where the court\nfaced a similar issue under the Magistrates Act, the\nnonconsensual referral of petitions to magistrates, and\nsaid that all of these cases, 1983 cases are, indeed,\nconditions of confinement cases, and Congress wanted to\nuse that language and that meaning given by this term so\nas to avoid corollary or, as you put it quite well,\nsatellite litigation that, in fact -- in fact has been\nspawned in the Second Circuit by the Nussle case, and we\nsee it, for example, in Royster v. United States, which is\nbefore this Court on cert, where excessive force is no\nlonger even involved.\nIt's a particularized instance, as the court of\nappeals referred to it, of denial of the documents, legal\ndocuments that the prisoner claims he is entitled to\nreceive, and courts then and now would have to decide what\nkinds of cases are excessive force, if they are mixed with\nother cases that may not be excessive force, if they seem\nto involve in some respect ongoing conditions --\nQUESTION: You can certainly find some Eighth\nAmendment claims that have nothing to do with excessive\nforce, I think. A case comes to mind that we decided\nearlier this term, a case called Molesco, which came from\nthe Second Circuit. It didn't come here under the Prison\nLitigation Act, but what happened there was that the\nprisoner had a heart condition, he ordinarily was allowed\nto use the elevator to go up to the sixth floor cell, this\nday the prison attendant said no, you can't use the\nelevator, so he walked up the stairs and had a heart\nattack.\nNow, that case was brought under the Eighth\nAmendment. I take it under your view that if it were a\nprison litigation action he should have to exhaust\nadministrative remedies.\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.\nHe ought to be required to exhaust because in that case,\nfor example, the prison administrator could and might well\nmake adjustments to the facilities, might do retraining,\ndifferent decisions on hiring, in fact, disciplining --\nQUESTION: General Blumenthal, on the other side\nof that is the argument that Nussle makes that he said\nthat the guards told me if I report what they did they\nwould kill me, so are there assurances -- you said the\nvalue of -- no risk to the prisoners, this is going on, so\nthat they can cure it. He says, if I told they said they\nwere going to kill me. Are there assurances in the system\nthat there isn't going to be retaliation of someone who\nmakes an internal complaint?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Certainly in Connecticut's\nsystem, Justice Ginsburg, there are such assurances, and\nin the joint appendix at 11 and at other places there are\nrequirements for confidentiality, for example. There is a\nrequirement for an informal contact or request.\nIn the Connecticut system, the commissioner\nentertains, personally reads, is on the floor and, indeed,\nthere is the requirement that the lieutenant make two\nrounds every day, that a captain make one round, that he\nbe or she be accessible in those circumstances, and that\nprotection be provided, and that is, as a matter of fact,\none of the advantages of exhausting, because it assures\ntimely, prompt attention.\nQUESTION: General Blumenthal, I don't really\nunderstand this. Was the threat that the guards made, if\nyou tell somebody through an administrative internal\nprocedure we're going to kill you, but it's perfectly okay\nto go to a court directly. We just really want you to\nexhaust administrative remedies. We'll kill you if you\nexhaust administrative remedies.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But if you go right to the court,\nthat's okay. Is that realistically what the threat was?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Justice Scalia, the --\nQUESTION: So this problem, you have it no\nmatter what, don't you?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You can't --\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: The threat of retaliation\nwas more general.\nQUESTION: I would think so.\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: And it was never verified,\nof course.\nQUESTION: Prison guards don't --\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: It was a claim.\nQUESTION: -- administrative law generally, in\nmy experience.\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Well, they're learning,\nJustice Scalia, and part of the claim here was one of\nretaliation, but it --\nQUESTION: Was he still in prison when he\nbrought this case?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: He was in prison when he\nbrought this lawsuit. He waited for 3 years. He waited\nuntil literally 3 to 5 days, depending on whether you look\nat the complaint or whatever, until the statute of\nlimitations was about to expire, and then he went to\ncourt.\nIt was not a timely, emergent, exigent plea for\nhelp, and if there had been a real threat physically to\nhim, the prison administration would have afforded a far\nmore effective means of protection than going to Federal\ncourt and seeking some remedy -- and by the way, he sought\nmoney damages. He didn't seek any protection or\ninjunctive relief -- than going to Federal court and\nseeking some remedy far in the future.\nThe excessive force claim -- and I want to be\nvery frank about it -- is intertwined with the single\nepisode contention on which the court of appeals also\nrelied, and in our view the excessive force claim, the\nthreat of physical harm, is a more difficult one because\nit's raised in this Court's cases, in Hudson v. McMillian,\nand Farmer v. Brennan, which deal with the element of\nproof, the elements of proof that have to be provided to\nmake out a claim, with the standard of intent that has to\nbe shown.\nQUESTION: You acknowledge they do draw this\ndistinction between prison conditions and excessive force\ncases?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: They do, Justice Kennedy,\nbut only for the purpose of the standard of proof or\nintent, and this Court has made that distinction very\nclear in Crawford-El v. Britton, which is cited in the\nbriefs at 523 U.S. 574, and particularly at 585 the Court\ndraws the distinction, because in Crawford-El it is saying\nthat a heightened standard of intent need not be shown,\nshould not be required in order to protect prison\nofficials from frivolous lawsuits or from discovery.\nAnd the Court says we have a law that will do\nthat, we have the PLRA, and it says about the PLRA, most\nsignificantly, and I'm quoting from 585, most\nsignificantly the statute draws no distinction between\nconstitutional claims that require proof of an improper\nmotive and those that do not, so the Court there -- and it\ngoes on to say, if there is a compelling need to frame new\nrules of law based on such a distinction, presumably\nCongress either would have dealt with the problem in the\nreform act, or will respond to it in future legislation.\nWhat the Court is doing there is saying, and it\ndoes so after a footnote that cites Farmer, and refers to\nthe Eighth Amendment, that is to say, footnote 7, we don't\nmean that prison conditions should exclude the excessive\nforce claims simply because we have said in Farmer and\nHudson v. McMillian that under the questions presented\nthere they would do so, so the Court I think as answer --\nthis Court has answered that question, and --\nQUESTION: Is this the citation to Crawford-El?\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Crawford-El is 523 United\nStates 574, and I have been quoting from 585.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: And 597. The quote was\nfrom 597, but I want to make clear, in fairness, that\nquotation is not central to the holding of the case, which\nI mentioned earlier. It is a distinction that the Court\ndraws so as to in effect provide reassurance that the\nPrisoner Litigation Reform Act will do the job of\neliminating frivolous litigation as, indeed, it did in\n1997a(c), where it provided for dismissal of actions that\nare frivolous, malicious, or seek monetary damage from an\nofficial who is immune, and it uses the term, prison\nconditions.\nIn fact, prison conditions is also a term used\nin 1997e(f), where there's a reference to the pretrial\nproceedings that can occur by means of video, or\ntelephone, or other telephone communications technology.\nThere is no reason that the term, prison conditions, in\nthose sections of the statute, ought to exclude excessive\nforce cases or single episode instances of misconduct and,\nindeed, it would do violence, it would be directly\ncontradictory to the purposes of Congress, which were to\nreduce the volume of litigation, particularly frivolous\nlitigation, to give prison administrators a chance to\ncorrect errors or mistakes and to reduce the interference\nof Federal courts in prison administration, and to provide\na better record if there is going to be resort to the\nFederal courts.\nWith the Court's permission, if there are no\nfurther questions I'd like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Blumenthal.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor four reasons, actions that challenge\nparticular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive\nforce are actions with respect to prison conditions that\nmust be exhausted under the PLRA.\nFirst, in three cases, this Court has used the\nterms, prison conditions, or conditions of confinement, to\nrefer to particular instances of unlawful conduct and, in\none of those cases, McCrary v. Bronson, it applied the\nterm to a single episode of excessive force. There's no\nreason to think that Congress intended any narrower\nmeaning here.\nSecond, the purposes of the exhaustion provision\nare to give prison officials an opportunity to resolve\nproblems within the prison by themselves, and to reduce\nthe enormous volume of prison litigation in Federal\ncourts. In terms of those two purposes, there's\nabsolutely no reason to distinguish between actions that\nchallenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as\nexcessive force and any other sort of prisoner complaint.\nPrison authorities in fact have a particularly strong\ninterest in resolving complaints about staff misconduct on\ntheir own, and grievance procedures are fully effective to\ndo that without any need for significant Federal court\nlitigation.\nThird, as this Court has recognized, it is\nextremely difficult to administer a line between isolated\nepisodes or particular instances and more systematic\npractices, or actions undertaken pursuant to a policy.\nAny effort to do that would generate substantial\nadditional litigation on a threshold collateral issue when\nCongress' goal was to reduce the amount of judicial\nresources devoted to prisoner complaints.\nAnd finally, creating an exception for\nparticular instances of unlawful conduct has the potential\nto create an enormous loophole in the exhaustion\nrequirement. Already, that exception has been applied by\nthe Second Circuit to retaliation claims, to confiscation\nof property claims, and it has the potential and\ncapability to be applied to a wide variety of prisoner\ncomplaints that are directed at the actions of individual\nofficers.\nIt is very unlikely that the Congress amended\nthis exhaustion provision for the express purpose of\nmaking sure that a dramatically increased number of cases\nwould have to go through the exhaustion process, would\nhave simultaneously cut out that large category of claims\nthat could benefit from the exhaustion process.\nQUESTION: Could you tell me on your point 1,\nyou cited the case where excessive force applied to --\nprison conditions applied to a single incident. What was\nthat case?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: McCrary v. Bronson.\nQUESTION: And was that pre or post enactment of\nthe litigation reform act?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's preenactment.\nQUESTION: Preenactment.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And in that case was a\nconstruction of the Magistrates Act that had nonconsensual\nreferral in cases involving conditions of confinement, and\nthe Court interpreted the phrase, Conditions of\nconfinement, to embrace single incidents, including\nexcessive force, and rejected an alternative construction\nthat is similar to the one adopted by the Second Circuit\nhere that prison conditions refers to systematic\npractices, and it did so for the same reasons, really,\nthat you should reach the same conclusion here.\nThe Court said that the purpose of that act was\nto reduce the workload of Federal courts, and that would\nfurther that purpose, and it said that trying to draw that\ndistinction between individual actions and systematic\npractices would provoke -- generate a whole new round of\nlitigation, when what we're trying to deal with here is\nsomething that's trying to save time.\nQUESTION: What about Hudson and Farmer?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Hudson and Farmer show that the\nterm, prison conditions, can be used in a narrower sense,\nand that context matters, but here the context was in\ndefining the substantive elements for proving a particular\nkind of Eighth Amendment violation, and the substantive\nstandards for proving a claim really have nothing to do\nwith whether a claim should be exhausted.\nThe context we have here is an exhaustion\nprovision, and the purposes of exhaustion, as I have said,\nare to give prison officials a chance to act first to\nsolve a problem and to reduce the volume of litigation\nand, in light of those purposes, it simply makes no sense\nto adopt a narrower meaning. Instead, the Court should\nadopt a broader meaning that comes from Preiser v.\nRodriguez, and McCrary v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter.\nQUESTION: Of course, still in all, even in\nHudson, I guess, drawing a distinction between continuing\nprison conditions and single incident prison conditions,\nor single incidents that aren't prison conditions, still\ninvolves you in the same problem of satellite litigation\nthat you say would be one of the horrible effects of\nadopting the same interpretation in the present case. I\nmean, that didn't stop us from coming out that way in\nHudson. Maybe it should have, but it didn't.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, two responses to\nthat. One is that the line that was actually drawn in\nHudson as I read it is not between single instances and\nsystematic practices, it's between excessive force claims\nand everything else, which is -- does still have its\ndifficulties in administration, but maybe not quite as\nchallenging as single instances versus systematic\npractices.\nThe other difference is, we're talking about\napplying something at the liability stage to make a\ndetermination on whether there has been liability enough,\nas opposed to, what do we do right at the outset of\nlitigation when somebody comes in with a complaint, it's a\nthreshold question, and generating additional litigation\nabout that on a threshold question on a collateral issue\nit seems to me is something that you would want to\ngenerate less litigation about, generally speaking.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Williams.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WILLIAMS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nWhen Congress enacted the Prison Litigation\nReform Act, it did so on the heels of at least three\ndecisions by this Court which clearly defined the term,\nprison conditions, to exclude excessive force cases and\nthose cases start, of course, with Wilson v. Seiter, which\nexpressly held, and I will quote, the very high state of\nmind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison\nconditions cases.\nQUESTION: What was at issue in Wilson v.\nSeiter?\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, of course, that was a\nmedical indifference case, deliberate indifference case\ninvolving the distinction between a single incident and\nmultiple incidents, and to the extent that the Second\nCircuit, post Nussle, has gone on to attempt to draw a\ndistinction of that kind, we do not defend it. The\ndistinction which I think is applicable here in defining\nthe term, prison conditions, is excessive force cases\nversus all other types of cases, other than --\nQUESTION: So on the other side of the line so\nfar as you're concerned would be a number of single\nincident types of thing that did not involve excessive\nforce?\nMR. WILLIAMS: Yes, indeed. I think the\ndistinction is one that this Court has made it absolutely\nclear the distinction is between -- has to do with the\nmens rea that's required. If the mens rea is a malicious,\nsadistic, intending to cause pain, that's not a prison\ncondition. If it is, however, deliberate indifference,\nthat is a prison condition.\nQUESTION: But why would Congress have made that\ndistinction and said that one -- the kind of cases you're\nrefer -- shouldn't exhaust administrative remedies whereas\nthe other one should. It doesn't -- I can see -- you can\ncertainly draw a definitional line, but why would Congress\nhave said case A exhaust, case B don't?\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, excessive force cases are\ndifferent. They've always been different under this\nCourt's jurisprudence. There are many protections that\nare already built in to avoid frivolous litigation in the\nexcessive force context.\nFor example, the standard itself, cruel,\nmalicious, sadistic, is a very tough one to meet. Second,\nLeatherman, of course, did not remove or excuse getting\naway with just notice pleading. It required fact\npleading, so that when you combine the requirement of fact\npleading with the high standard that has to be met there's\na very -- it's a very rare case that will pass a 12(b)(6)\nmotion if it's an excessive force case in the first place.\nQUESTION: Isn't the answer to your argument,\nthough, the answer that Mr. Gornstein gave a moment ago\nwhen he referred to the significance of context? If the\nissue before the Court involves a distinction among\ndifferent kinds of prison cases, then we can certainly\nunderstand the distinction when we say conditions are\ndifferent from particular incidents, and if you refer only\nconditions, you're meaning to exclude particular\nincidents.\nBut if we're trying to draw a distinction\nbetween prison cases and all kinds of -- all other kinds\nof 1983 cases, which was the case when Congress passed\nthis statute, then I suppose it does make good sense to\nuse prison conditions in a much broader sense to cover\neverything that might come out of prison litigation to\ndistinguish it from other kinds of 1983 cases, and isn't\nthat the answer to your argument based on our use of the\nterm in certain cases?\nMR. WILLIAMS: I think that's more a policy\nissue than a statutory construction issue, and I think\nthat this is just a simple case of statutory construction.\nQUESTION: But the -- I mean, Mr. Gornstein's\nargument is kind of a compared-to-what argument. He's\nsaying, when you use the phrase, conditions, what are you\ncomparing the conditions against? Are you comparing them\nagainst other kinds of things that happen in a prison, or\nare you comparing them against other kinds of cases that\nmight be brought under 1983, and the answer is possibly\ngoing to be quite different, depending on which context\nyou're in.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, I think the context in\nwhich this Court has used it, and therefore in which\nCongress is presumed to have used it, is the latter.\nQUESTION: The cases that, including the one you\ncite, the Government cites for the opposite proposition.\nMR. WILLIAMS: I think --\nQUESTION: The cases say, and they have loads of\nlanguage there which seem to say it, that Wilson v. Seiter\nand three other cases did focus on the issue of single\nincident versus affecting several people. They all\ndecided that single incident is within the meaning of\nprison conditions or the like.\nSenator Biden on the floor says, if you pass\nthis law, you are going to sweep within it excessive force\ncases, and nobody denies it, all of which from the most --\nand the language, the language admits of Justice Souter's\nsuggestion, and he provides a purpose.\nSo taking all those things together, why isn't\nthe law in this case precisely along the lines he\nsuggested?\nMR. WILLIAMS: There's no doubt that the cases\ninvolved do not see a principal distinction between single\nincident and multiple incident cases. That, I think, is\nwhere the Second Circuit in the post Nussle cases has gone\nwrong. I don't defend that. I think that the distinction\nis the one that this Court has always drawn, which is\nbetween the excessive force mens rea, which is cruel,\nmalicious, sadistic, intending to cause pain and nothing\nelse, on the one hand --\nQUESTION: That's only excessive force?\nQUESTION: That's only excessive force?\nQUESTION: I see somebody in dire need of\nmedical attention and I sit there smiling cruelly --\nplease, get me a doctor.\nMR. WILLIAMS: That is exactly --\nQUESTION: You call that excessive force?\nMR. WILLIAMS: That's -- no. That's deliberate\nindifference. This Court has often said that. That's\nexactly what we're talking about.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. WILLIAMS: There -- it's -- indeed --\nQUESTION: It has nothing to do with the things\nyou were saying, then, cruelty, and savagery, whatever.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, the term is --\nQUESTION: You can be just as cruel and savage\nwithout applying excessive force, if you do it right.\nMR. WILLIAMS: The -- we can have words mean\nwhatever we want them to mean, but this Court has made it\nclear what it means when it refers to excessive force, and\nthat is the mens rea that we were just talking about\nwhich, after all, comes from Judge Friendly's seminal\nopinion in Johnson v. Glick.\nThat, however, is not what we mean when we talk\nabout prison conditions, and this Court has made that\nclear, and made it clear at the time Congress enacted the\nPLRA, and I think that the important distinction between\nthe PLRA and the Magistrates Act is that when the\nMagistrates Act was passed, all they had -- and that's\nwhat this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson, all they had\nto guide them on the meaning of the term was Preiser, and\nso following Preiser, of course, that's what it meant, and\nthat's why they used it that way in the Magistrates Act.\nBut after this Court decided McCarthy and\nBrennan, this Court then went on to address the issue,\nfocus on the language, and explain this very distinction\nthat I'm arguing for here, and it was after this Court had\ndone so in three cases, one after the other, that Congress\nthen passed the PLRA.\nQUESTION: That's what I don't understand. Now,\nI didn't realize this. You're conceding, I take it, that\nan individual incident is a prison condition, as long as\nit isn't an excessive force incident, and at that point,\nalthough maybe there are three cases that say this -- I'll\nread them -- why would anybody want to say that a single\nincident refusing to feed a prisoner, a single incident\nrefusing to give him medical assistance, a single incident\nrefusing to let him take exercise in fact is a prison\ncondition, but a single incident of hitting him is not?\nMR. WILLIAMS: I can't speak for Congress'\nintention, but I can speak for the meaning of the words as\nthey've been defined by the Court, and there is an obvious\ndistinction under this Court's cases. That's what we're\ntalking about when we talk about statutory construction,\nand that's why I say that this is not a grand policy case.\nThis is a traditional --\nQUESTION: Well, but we're also talking about\nreaching a sensible result.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, the sensible result is the\nresult that this Court has often reached in the past,\nwhich is to say to Congress, if this is what you want to\ndo, do it in the way that you're supposed to do it.\nQUESTION: But it really isn't quite that clear\nwhat Congress wanted to do as between these two views.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, of course, if Congress is\nambiguous, then we go back to the default position, and\nthe default position is, we go back to dictionary meaning,\nand this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson that if you\njust look to the dictionary definition of the term, prison\nconditions, you're not talking about excessive force\ncases, and in McCarthy this Court said, however, we don't\nuse the dictionary definition because when the Magistrates\nAct was passed Congress is presumed to have been looking\nto Preiser, but once Congress gets mushy, as they really\nare in the PLRA, because some sections use the term prison\nconditions, some sections don't, and that's even true in\nthe title 42 amendment, so --\nQUESTION: Mr. Williams, there's a case that has\ncome up in various forms where violence, random violence\nis what characterizes the prison system. There was the\nlitigation in Alabama, where the State Attorney General\nsaid, this, the atmosphere in this prison is jungle-like,\nand this Court said it in Dosset v. Rawlinson. Where do\nyou put those cases? Those are excessive force cases, but\nit's pervasive in the prison, not just one beating by a\nguard. Would those cases come outside the prison\nLitigation Reform Act, even though you're talking about\nthe kind of conduct that pervades the entire institution?\nMR. WILLIAMS: I'm not sure that this Court has\never told us exactly what the mens rea is that must be met\nin such a case, and I think that will be the answer to the\nquestion when that case arises. If this Court says that\nin any given pervasive violence situation, then the\nnecessary mens rea remains the Johnson v. Glick one, then\nthat's an excessive force case and it's not a prison\nconditions case.\nOn the other hand, if this Court says that the\nnecessary mens rea is simply deliberate indifference, then\nit is a prison conditions case.\nQUESTION: Well, it's hard to say it's\ndeliberate indifference when you're beating up on someone.\nMR. WILLIAMS: If you're suing the individual\nguard, of course, you're dealing with an instance of\nbrutality. What I was thinking of is the more interesting\nquestion of where the warden issues a decree.\nQUESTION: The warden knows that this is going\non. It's not deliberate indifference, because it's a\njungle-like atmosphere.\nMR. WILLIAMS: If the warden is aware of it and\nis tolerating it, then it becomes policy, and then this\nCourt is going to have to say, well, what's the standard\nof liability for the warden? Is it deliberate\nindifference or is it the Johnson v. Glick? I don't know.\nI don't believe this Court has told us.\nQUESTION: I would think that just the usage,\nordinary English, what the words mean, when a condition\npervades a prison, then it's a prison condition.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, I think that that gets off\ninto the single incident versus multiple incident issue,\nand I prefer to think of it in terms of the mens rea, and\nI can conceive that an argument might well be made, and in\nfact I would be happy to make it, that where it is so\npervasive that the warden is charged with actual knowledge\nof -- there's the municipal liability cases under 1983 --\nthat he's charged with knowledge of it, then I would say\nthat the Johnson v. Glick standard applies, and it's not a\nprison condition, but you could make the other argument\njust as well.\nIn any event, it's an easy line to draw so that\nwe will know, the district courts will know in any given\ncase where it falls on the line of --\nQUESTION: Why in the world would Congress --\nyou can give us no inkling of why Congress would sit down\nand say, whether there has to be exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies ought to depend upon what state of\nmind the actor is going to be held to? Why is there any\nconceivable connection between those two issues, and\nthat's what you're saying they did, that they left it up\nto the future law of this Court as to what mens rea will\nbe required, and if on the one hand the mens rea is going\nto be, you know, just deliberate indifference, then you\nhave to exhaust, and if it's intentional cruelty you don't\nhave to exhaust.\nMR. WILLIAMS: I would think that the reason for\nthat, if Congress had a reason, is that Congress knew that\nbecause of the very high bar this Court has a record in\nexcessive force cases, combined with the fact pleading\nrequirement, that the concerns Congress had about\nfrivolous litigation and undue meddling of the district\ncourts in their business are already met by existing law,\nand therefore the PLRA need not be concerned with it and\nindeed, I think just about everybody agrees that the\nconcerns of Congress in enacting the PLRA was precisely\nthose two things, neither of which readily fits the\nexcessive force model.\nQUESTION: But if you have a guard who is\nsadistically beating people, certainly that seems to be\nthe sort of thing that might easily be corrected, at least\nfor the future, by exhaustion.\nMR. WILLIAMS: But that, again, is a policy\nquestion, Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, it is, but when we're trying to\nfigure out what Congress really intended here, I think one\nshies away from a distinction which is perfectly\ntechnically sound but doesn't seem to have anything to do\nwith what people thinking about the desirability of\nexhaustion would have thought about.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, when you look at the entire\nPLRA, and I was a little dismayed in preparing for oral\nargument to realize that the entire PLRA isn't in the\njoint appendix to our briefs, but when you look at it in\nits entirety, the presence or absence of that phrase,\nprison conditions, is quite interesting.\nFor instance, in title 42, prison conditions do\nnot apply to the attorney fee cap. Rather, that relates\nto prisoner suits, and similarly the distinction that\nthere can be no monetary award for emotional distress\nunless it's accompanied by physical injury, those are\nprisoner suits, not prison conditions cases.\nWhen you look further, section 807, the lien\nprovisions under the act, again, there's no prison\nconditions limitation, so clearly Congress had in mind\nthat there are some kinds of suits by prisoners where it\nwants to impose more stringent limitations and others\nwhere it wants to impose some limitations but not the\nwhole panoply of limitations.\nQUESTION: But here the prisoner suits, it\nhappens to be the caption for the provision. They use in\nthe text prison conditions but the caption is prison\nsuits, isn't it?\nMR. WILLIAMS: Yes, it is, and then in the\ncontext of the section they go on and draw the\ndistinction. Sometimes it's all prisoner suits, sometimes\nit's just prisoner suits about prison conditions, so I\nthink we really get no place in particular from the fact\nof the caption.\nQUESTION: What would we do with a case where\nthe prisoner said, these guards are beating up on me, and\nthe reason they are is that this prison doesn't give\nguards any training, doesn't supervise them, so my 1983\nsuit is against the guards that beat me up, but they're\nalso against the officials in the prison who are\nresponsible for training and for monitoring? Those have\nto go to --\nMR. WILLIAMS: They go two different directions\nand, of course, as we know, that is common place in\nprisoner's suits, that they have multiple counts, multiple\nclaims, and some of them are dismissed early on, some of\nthem go a little bit farther, and so forth. That is the\nnature of prison litigation in this particular case, the\nsuit against the guard for beating him up would not\nrequire exhaustion and would go forward. Prison\nconditions claims obviously would have to be exhausted,\nhad they not already been exhausted.\nQUESTION: Suppose I believe that policy was\nrelevant, would I then be right to think that the isolated\nbeating case is perhaps the strongest case where you\nshould require exhaustion, for the reason that the prison\ndoesn't want such a person on its payroll, and if the\nprisoner is right, they'll find out about it fast and get\nrid of him\nMR. WILLIAMS: No, actually, the difficulties of\nremoving a civil servant who has --\nQUESTION: Oh, but I'll take action.\nMR. WILLIAMS: When you combine all of his\nLaudermill rights with all of his rights under the\ncollective bargaining agreement, moving that guard or\ntaking meaningful disciplinary action against him is not\ngoing to be necessarily that fast.\nOf course, what you can do quickly is move the\nprisoner to another unit, but then you deal with what we\nknow to be the reality of the prison guard grapevine, so\nthat there's not an easy solution.\nQUESTION: You say that a prison guard who\nmaliciously beats up on people is just there to stay, so\nto speak?\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, one would hope not.\nQUESTION: One would.\nMR. WILLIAMS: But the fact of the matter is\nthat, like all public employees, they enjoy a number of\ndue process protections and, like most public employees,\nthey also enjoy union protection.\nQUESTION: Many of them are not public employees\nany more.\nMR. WILLIAMS: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Many of them are not public employees\nany more. That's one reason some States have moved to\nhaving private companies manage prisons.\nMR. WILLIAMS: I agree. I agree. That is true.\nQUESTION: In those cases there wouldn't be a\nproblem in getting rid of a guard.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Well, there's probably still a\npretty effective union contract. The guards' union is a\npretty powerful force and, indeed, in this case that was\npresent. There were the references to the fact that the\nguards' union was involved in a big dispute with the\nGovernor of Connecticut, who happened to be a friend of\nMr. Nussle, so that that was present.\nThe attempt by the State to take the title 18\ndefinition and move it over to title 42 I think is equally\nunsuccessful. The fact that it's in a different part of\nthe code is one reason why Congress certainly wouldn't\nhave attempted to adopt it. Indeed, it's in a part of the\ncode, title 18, that deals with different issues from\nthose which Congress was dealing with in its title 42\namendments.\nMost importantly, of course, it is explicitly\nlimited by its terms to section 802, that is, title 18,\nand is not applicable elsewhere and, as this Court held in\nthe Vermont Agency of National Resources case, that at\nleast suggests that it is inapplicable to title 42.\nAlso of great interest, and I think not\naddressed in the briefs, is that section 803 has its own\ndefinition section, just as section 802 does, but in the\nsection 803 definition the term, prison conditions, or\nconditions of confinement, is not defined, but\ninterestingly, in section 802 and in section 803 there is\na definition of the word, prisoner. The words aren't\nprecisely the same, but the words appear to have the same\nmeaning.\nNow, why would Congress find it necessary to\ndefine prisoner in section 803 when they'd already done so\nin 802, unless it was because they took seriously the\nlimitation in 802, that the definitions there were limited\nto section 802?\nSo I think that the attempt by the petitioners\nto borrow the section 802 language and incorporate that\ninto section 803 simply won't work, and what we are left\nto fall back on is the statutory construction arguments\nwhich I have previously made.\nI hate to say it, but I think I'm out of time.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: You're not out of time, but you're\nwelcome to sit down.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Out of ideas.\nQUESTION: Yes, okay.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Williams.\nMr. Blumenthal, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nI am not completely out of ideas. A few brief\nones: First, to expand, perhaps, on the point raised by\nJustice Breyer, I can't speak for all the State prison\nsystems throughout the United States, but a prison guard\nwho did what Mr. Nussle claimed he or they did would be\ntransferred, disciplined, perhaps fired by this\ncommissioner. I am certain of that fact, because we have\nassisted in that process.\nIndeed, some of those guards have been\ncriminally investigated, not guards involving this\nincident, but some who have committed the kinds of acts\nthat Mr. Nussle might complain of. There are speedy,\neffective administrative remedies that can be applied to\nprotect prisoners, and it is in the interests, may I\nrespectfully suggest, of the State to do so to eliminate\nor at least reduce prison unrest, to make sure that it\nisn't held liable in more serious incidents, if they are\nbad guards.\nThe administrators of modern prison systems have\na very powerful and compelling self-interest in using the\ngrievance system as a management tool. Now, that may not\nhave been on Congress' mind. Congress undoubtedly was\nconcerned, as the legislative history clearly shows, with\nthe fact that there were 40,000 of these lawsuits pending,\nprisoner petitions, constituting one-quarter of the entire\nFederal case load. Congress wanted to streamline the\nsystem and force all of these prison petitions to go\nthrough the exhaustion process, and there is no evidence,\nabsolutely no evidence in the legislative history or\nelsewhere it intended to carve out or make an exception\nfor single incident excessive force cases and, indeed, the\nevidence is all to the contrary.\nMcCarthy v. Bronson was a single incident,\nsingle episode of excessive force, but this Court said\nthat it was included in the term, conditions of\nconfinement, for purposes of the Magistrate Referral Act.\nThat is the term that Congress understood it to be.\nCrawford-El confirms at 597, where I quoted it. It's in\nour view conclusive on this point, but we would submit\nthat the interests of the statute are best served,\nCongress' purposes are best served. The distinction that\nis suggested by the respondents is unsupported in\nprinciple and unworkable in practice for many of the same\nreasons that this Court said in Wilson v. Seiter that the\nsingle incident versus continuing practice distinction was\nsimply illogical and impractical.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I have\nnothing further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\n"
