        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis.\nMr. Schnapper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe first sentence of Section 7703(b)(2)\nprovides that district courts have jurisdiction over all\nmixed cases, and that provision is largely dispositive\nhere.\nThe second sentence of 7703(b)(2) on which\nthe Government relies is a statute of limitations, and\nit doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts.\nThat subsection is set out at pages 16a to\n17a of the Government's brief. The first sentence\nprovides that for a described category of cases, they\nare to be, quote, \"filed under one of the listed Federal\nantidiscrimination statutes.\"\nAs this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of\nthose are statutes which authorize jurisdiction\nand claims in district courts. Indeed, in Title VII and\nthe ADEA, that is the only Federal court which is\nauthorized to hear the cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, could you\nclarify what the district court, as you see it, does?\nDoes it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does\nit deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: With regard to the -- when\nthe case gets to district court, there may be two\nsubstantive claims, a discrimination claim and a CSRA\nclaim. Your question, I take it, is about the former.\nOur view is that the claim is filed and\npled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a\ndiscrimination case; in this case, under several\ndifferent statutes. And the complaint here reads very\nmuch like an ordinary discrimination complaint.\nThe Government may raise the -- that sort of\nprocedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would\nbe free to do so here. And that -- that happens on a\nnumber of occasions.\nFor example, if there were a case in which\nthe Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations,\nappealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt\nof the agency decision, the Government could move to\ndismiss that claim on what the lower courts call\nexhaustion grounds. And the lower courts have\nrepeatedly sustained those motions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schnapper --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- but that's a\ndeterminative defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the critical\npoint, I gather, is what standard of review the district\ncourt will apply to that exhaustion question, or the\nbar question, right?\nI assume you think that the standard review\nin the district court is going to be more favorable to\nyour client than the standard -- the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard that would be applicable in the\nFederal circuit?\nI guess --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: When it's come up,\nYour Honor, it has generally been a question of law,\nlike whether the 30-day rule had applied. If you had\nsomething that was -- if it were a factual issue, our\ncontention is then those Section 7703(c) factual issues\nhave to be decided de novo.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't we take this --\nthis very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the\nclaim was time barred, so the Government would raise it\nas an affirmative defense.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: And the first question would\nbe whether it's an affirmative defense at all, and our\nposition would be that it is not. Not everything that\ncould go awry in the internal procedure is an\naffirmative defense.\nOne of the central principles of the\n1972 amendments to Title VII was to create an exhaustion\nregime which is precise, simple and short. And if --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I back\nyou up a minute to join the two questions that my\ncolleague posed to you?\nLet's assume there's a merits-based decision\non the CSRA and one on the discrimination. In the\nnormal course, assuming you are not barred by being\nuntimely, you could go to the district court, and the\ndistrict court presumably would have jurisdiction, if\none is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both\nquestions.\nWhat's the standard of review that a court\nwould apply to each of those claims independently or\ntogether? I mean --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: They're there --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that that's --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- it's -- yeah, I totally\nunderstand the question.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can then fight about\nwhether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and\nexhaustion should be subject to one or the other\nstandard of review, but what are the standards of\nreview?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: They -- they are\ndifferent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the discrimination\nclaim is dealt with de novo. The intent of Congress\nwas that it would generally be treated like a private\ndiscrimination claim.\nHowever, the CSRA claim is dealt with under\nthe same standard that would apply in the Federal\ncircuit. And that's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you tell me\nwhat --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- well established.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to\ninterrupt you.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's what the lower courts\nhave been doing. And we don't -- we think that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you finish your prior\nanswer? You -- you started to say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you started to say that\nthe Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental\nchange?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. I was\ntalking about the amendments to the 19 -- to Title VII\nin 1972.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Prior to that, courts were\napplying the -- judicially fashioned exhaustion\nrequirements. And the -- Congress made a decision to\nreplace that.\nAs this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown\nv. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the\nCourt's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary\nto exhaust were not clear.\nSo the regime established by Section 717 of\nTitle VII, which was adopted in 1972, sets up an\nexhaustion requirement which is clear, simple and\nlimited in time. It requires the plaintiff to file a\ncomplaint, wait at that point 180 days, and at that\npoint, the plaintiff was done and could go to district\ncourt.\nPlaintiff also had the option at that point\nof going to the Civil Service Commission, waiting\n180 days. But as long as a timely complaint was filed,\nthat was all that was required of the plaintiff. And\nthat was a fundamental change in the way this had been\ndealt with.\nThe ADEA regime, which was adopted in 1974,\nwas actually even simpler, although it's been changed a\nlittle bit since. The plaintiff to exhaust had to do\nonly one of two things, either file a complaint with the\nEEOC, period, or give the EEOC notice that the plaintiff\nwas going to sue and wait 30 days.\nAs the Government pointed out in its brief\nin Stevens, the exhaustion regime under the ADEA hadn't\n-- didn't in any way address what happened after the\ncomplaint was filed. It simply said, file the\ncomplaint.\nThat is the fundamental principle that's\nanimated the Title VII exhaustion requirement in Title\nVII and the ADEA, and we don't think the CSRA was\nwritten to change that.\nIndeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it\ndoesn't do so expressly -- it incorporates by reference\nthose statutes; it expressly reiterates the de novo\nexhaustion requirement. It actually shortened the\nperiod of time that plaintiff has to wait for these\ncases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- you're talking\nabout the discrimination claim. In your view, could the\nplaintiff now in the district court say, I'll forget\nthe CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to\nhear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I\nneed? And so I'm not -- I'm abandoning my CSRA.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor. The Plaintiff\ncan do that. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then that would take\ncare of the whole thing you discussed before about the\naffirmative defense and the Government. It would be the\nplaintiff's choice, I want my Title VII case and that's\nit.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. The\naffirmative defenses could still be raised. It's just\nthat the CSRA claim under Section 7703(c) would -- would\nbe abandoned. And that's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what provision --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- that's what happened\nhere. It's not uncommon.\nThe CSRA claim involves a right that is much\nmore valuable to the plaintiff in the administrative\nprocess.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What provision authorizes\nthe filing of anything other than a discrimination claim\nin district court? I don't see it.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The statute says \"Cases of\ndiscrimination subject to\" -\nJUSTICE ALITO: \"Cases of discrimination\" --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: \"Cases of discrimination\nsubject to 7702.\" And 7702 --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. It says, \"shall be\nfiled under Title VII.\"\nSo you are saying that a nondiscrimination\nclaim can be filed under Title VII?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. The way the courts have\nread this, and I think correctly, is this: If -- so\nthis is just one case. It's a little bit like\nsupplemental jurisdiction. So long as the plaintiff is\nasserting a discrimination claim, the CSRA claim comes\nalong with it.\nIf the plaintiff were to abandon the\ndiscrimination claim, then the case would have to go to\nthe Federal Circuit. That's the way the courts have\ninterpreted that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that a\nlot of courts have read it that way. I find it\ndifficult to see how it fits in the statutory language.\nAnd in particular, since the second sentence of\nsubsection (2) there has its own filing deadline, it\nseems strange to have a district court review the\ntimeliness of the filing before the MSPB.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the second point you\nmake is really separate from the first, because even if\nonly a discrimination claim is filed, the Government can\ninsert an affirmative defense, and one possible\naffirmative defense which the Government has repeatedly\nasserted successfully is that the appeal to the MSPB was\nuntimely. So that happens either way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you give up\nyour CSRA claim, they can assert that defense?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes. It's because --\nbecause the discrimination statutes themselves have two\nrequirements. You have to have filed the complaint or\nan appeal, depending on where you are in the process.\nYou have to wait a certain amount of time if you don't\nhave a decision.\nThe statutes themselves don't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't understand why\nyou're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't\nsee any provision that says that -- that specifies what\nthe standard of review in the district court is for a\nnondiscrimination claim.\n(C) sets out the standard of review in the\nFederal Circuit for a nondiscrimination claim, but it\npointedly says nothing about the district court.\nDoesn't that suggest that that claim doesn't go to the\ndistrict court?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that question,\nof course, isn't here because we haven't asserted a CSRA\nclaim. And if you have doubts about it, I think I would\nreserve that for another case. But, we think the -- the\ncourts have treated this as -- the statute doesn't say\nclaims of discrimination subject to 7702. It says\n\"cases of discrimination.\"\nAnd if you look at section 7702, which is\nset out at page 8(a) of the Government's brief, it\ndescribes the cases involved as cases which contain\nthese two elements. They are treated as one case in the\nadministrative process. And it would be highly peculiar\nfor the Government -- for the statute to take one\nadministrative proceeding and then split it in half.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the\nCivil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about\n-- about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age\nDiscrimination and Employment Act and so forth. What\nwould the situation be? Wouldn't you have a right to go\nto district court?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Title VII and all the\nstatutes authorize that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, to prevent you from\ngoing to district court under those statutes, you have\nto find a repealer contained somewhere -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: In that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the Civil Service\nReform Act, correct?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's exactly right. And\nwe think this is a classic example of -- for application\nof the rule that implied repeals are disfavored. This\n-- this statute is quite precise when -- when it's\nchanging something, it's very specific. The second\nsection, section 7703(b)(2), begins with the words\n\"notwithstanding,\" because it is changing the statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise apply. It's changing\nit from 90 days in Title VII to 30 days.\nSo when Congress wanted to change something,\nit was very specific. But the whole thrust of this\nstatute is to leave in place, except where very\nspecifically it does otherwise, the regime that existed\nunder Title VII in the ADEA.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I\nunderstand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper. When\nyou talk about the affirmative defenses that the\nGovernment can raise, that is -- those are exhaustion\ndefenses under the applicable anti-discrimination\nstatute, right? It's whatever exhaustion requirements\nTitle VII sets out or whatever exhaustion requirements\nthe ADEA sets out; is that correct?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Not -- that's not entirely\ncorrect, Your Honor. There are -- there are exhaustion\npremises in the statute, but these statutes do not\ncontain a time period within which a charge or a\ncomplaint must be filed with the agency, and they don't\ncontain a time period within which an appeal must be\ntaken. Those time periods are in the regulations.\nThe lower courts have taken the position\nthat those time periods also have to be complied with,\nand we think that's correct.\nIn the case of --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Those time periods relevant\nto the MSPB?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: And there are also time\nperiods relevant to filing a -- complaint at the agency\nlevel. It's an -- in the case of a private\ndiscrimination claim, that time period is specified by\nTitle VII.\nBut Section 717 about Federal employees is\nsimply silent. Congress didn't deal with it. But it\ndid authorize the EEOC and the MSPB to write\nregulations. They have both written regulations that --\nwith regard to the agency, it is the EEOC regulations\nwhich set up the time period within which a complaint\nmust be filed. With regard to appeals to the MSPB, both\nthe EEOC and the MSPB have regulations which are the\nsame.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a\nrepealer of what would otherwise be the law under all\nthese civil rights statutes? Why isn't that a repealer\nof what would otherwise be their right to go to district\ncourt?\nYou are saying, no, you can't go to district\ncourt because of these time limits, not even established\nby statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by\nregulation. You think that that's -- that's an\neffective repealer of the right to go to district court?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: We don't -- we think not,\nYour Honor.\nAgain, this doesn't go to subject matter\njurisdiction, which is specified in the statute. The\nstatute creates a regime. It doesn't set up time\nperiods.\nWe think Congress -- the statute should be\nread to -- to mean that the authority of the Government,\nof the agencies to write regulations, includes\nregulations setting up time periods. It's just\ninconceivable that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And would that --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- Congress contemplated you\nwould have forever to do these things.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And would that put the\nemployee who has a mixed case in the same position as an\nemployee who has a straight anti-discrimination case?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Non-mixed case. Yes. Yes.\nThere are regulations governing both.\nThe non-mixed case claim would only be\ngoverned by the EEOC regulation. The mixed case claim\nis governed as well by the time limit in the MSPB\nregulation, but that is the same as the time limit in\nthe EEOC regulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I've probably led a\ncharmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until\nthis matter came before us. And I was -- I suppose you\nhave to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say\n\"cases,\" \"cases of discrimination,\" which is what this\nis.\nWe don't usually think of cases that we call\na discrimination case based on whether or not it\ncontains other issues. It's a case.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, the -- you\nhave led a charmed life.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I think that helps\nyou.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I'm not sure how that\naffects it. The phrase mixed case is in the\nregulations, both of the EEOC. It also was in currency\nprior to 1978. When Congress was working on this\nproblem, it was already calling these kinds of cases\nmixed cases.\nAnd, of course, we haven't touched on this.\nA mixed case is a case which involves -- has two\nelements. First, it involves what's called, under the\nCivil Service Reform Act, an appealable issue. That is\nan issue which can be appealed to the MSPB, not --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can't an employee take a\nmixed case appeal to the Federal circuit?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: You could not take that case\nto the Federal circuit without waiving your\nantidiscrimination claim. That is what the -- that's\nthe way we read the law and that is the way the MSPB\nreads the law. The MSPB regulation expressly provides\nthat if you want to go to the Federal circuit you must\nwaive that right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, can you\nexplain something about the MSPB's role? That is, once\nyou have a final decision from the agency, you could go\nright to court. You don't -- on the discrimination\nclaim, right? You don't need to go to the MSPB. You\ndon't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get\nyour discrimination claim. So, how does the M -- the\npossibility of going to the MSPB make the discrimination\nclaim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be\nif you stopped at the agency level?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's our view that\nonce you appeal to the MSPB, and putting aside the\nunusual situation of people who withdraw the appeal, you\nthen must wait, under the statute, 120 days or until you\nhave a decision. So you are ready, all set, and you\ncould go to court after the district court decision, but\nif you appeal to the MSPB, you then have to wait until\n120 days have passed or you have a decision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are -- what are your\nadvantages? You are deciding -- you have the final\nagency decision, you could go right to court on the\ndiscrimination claim. What do you gain by invoking the\nMSPB's authority?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: What you gain are the rights\nin Section 7701(c), which are set out on page 3(a) of\nthe Government's brief. In the appeal to the MSPB with\nregard to the Civil -- the CSRA claim, the burden is on\nthe Government to establish by a preponderance of the\nevidence that its decision was correct. If you bypass\nthe MSPB and go to district court, then your claim is\nonly a claim under section 7703(c), which requires the\nplaintiff to establish that there wasn't even\nsubstantial evidence to support the decision. So,\nplaintiff --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose -- I'm\nsorry.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The CSRA claim is much more\nvaluable at the MSPB. In terms of discrimination claim,\nin the real world that's probably not why people go to\nthe MSPB. The MSPB, according to the only study I've\nbeen able to find, out of 2,000 mixed cases the MSPB\nactually only found discrimination in four. But a much\nhigher percentage of CSRA claims are successful there.\nSo that's why people go there.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose if you\nsay, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency\nsays, no, you were fired because you were incompetent,\nyou could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and\nif you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent,\nthey shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and\nyou don't need to proceed with the discrimination --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Sure. And that's why people\ngo there. That's why people go there.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You argued that you were\nexceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction\nshould go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only\ninvoking the exception that procedural dismissals should\nbe permitted to go to the district court or authorized\nto go. Are you still standing by that distinction?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, no, that was not our\ndistinction. That was the distinction that I think in\nthe Tenth Circuit in Harms--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, but when you argued\nit below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the\njurisdictional rule. Are you abandoning that\ndistinction?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Our view is that all\nmixed cases go to the district court. That is the view\nof the MSPB and of the EEOC and the regulations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not the view of\nthe circuit courts, even the courts --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's not the view of the\ncircuit courts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even the courts whose\nexception you --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That is not their view and\nwe think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every circuit court\nunanimously holds that jurisdictional dismissals\nshould go only to the Federal circuit.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Right. We think that that's\nwrong and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry -- go ahead. I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Should you be arguing\nthis before us?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, you don't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this a distinction\nyou should abandon here?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or at least ask us not\nto address?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: You don't need to address\nit, but we think those decisions are wrong. The\nstatutory arguments that we're making treat -- draw no\ndistinction between procedural and jurisdictional --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually the 7512\nargument has more legs, I think. The point is that\nyou're only permitted to go to district court on issues\nof discrimination that are within the Board's\njurisdiction. So if --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's somewhat stronger, but\nthere are a couple of reasons why we think this\ndistinction doesn't make sense. The first one is if\njurisdictional issues went to the Federal circuit you\nwould have an -- a really bizarre problem of -- of\nsplitting the claim, and here's why: If, under the EEOC\nregulations which the Government has referred to, if the\nMSPB holds that it didn't have jurisdiction in a mixed\ncase, the discrimination claim doesn't die. Under the\nregulations it goes back to the agency, which then\nprocesses it as a non-mixed case. But the plaintiff is\nstill free to challenge the decision of the MSPB that it\nhad no jurisdiction. In the Government's view, that\nwould go to the Federal circuit. So the case would then\nbe pending in two different places. And if the\nplaintiff came to the end of the line in the -- at the\nagency level and lost, the plaintiff clearly would go to\ndistrict court. So the case would then be pending in\ntwo different places. On our view, everything goes to\nthe district court.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree\nwith everything that you just said, I can still rule for\nyou in this case, right?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: You can, and you don't need\nto address what I just said.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Because there does seem to\nbe a good deal of difference between the question, what\nhappens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and\nalternatively, the question of whether something is a\nmixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about\nan action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB.\nAnd one could think that questions about what can be\nappealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit\nunder this statutory language in a way that questions\nthat are involved in this case do not.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, you don't need\nto rule for that -- me on that, but if I could identify\nanother problem before my time runs out. There is --\nand it comes up in two ways. Sometimes whether a case\nis appealable depends on whether there was\ndiscrimination. There is a district court decision in\nBarrow v. Louisiana in which that problem arose. I will\nspare you --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that just makes the\nnext case very complicated but it has nothing to do with\nthis case; is that correct?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Right. But that's why I\nthink if you have doubts about it, you should stay away\nfrom it because that's very bad. In addition, in a\nconstructive discharge case based on sexual harassment,\nwhether there's jurisdiction, the MSPB in deciding\nwhether there is jurisdiction has to decide whether\nthere was sexual harassment. It seems to me you would\nnot want that going to the Federal circuit.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Harrington.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI would like to start if I could with\nJustice Scalia's -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you abandoning the\njurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your\nbrief? Are you telling us to rule either completely for\nyou or against you?\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's always been our\nposition, Justice Sotomayor. Our position has\nconsistently been that the only decisions of the MSPB\nthat can get review in a district court are decisions on\nthe issue of discrimination.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are prepared on\nbehalf of the Government to say that if we rule that\nprocedural dismissals can go to the district court, then\nyou -- then the Government will concede that\njurisdictional dismissal should as well?\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under 7512.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Again, we don't think any\nof them should and --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have to reach\nthat question in this case, but your brief seemed to\nmake the argument that there was no basis for the\ndistinction between procedural and jurisdictional.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I agree that there is no\nbasis for the distinction and part of that is because,\nas my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC\nregulation providing that when the board dismisses a\ncase on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to\nthe agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final\ndecision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district\ncourt. So if the whole point is to find a way for an\nemployee to get into district court on her\ndiscrimination claim, we've already had that taken care\nof in jurisdictional dismissal cases. So the action\nreally here is with procedural dismissals.\nAnd if -- I would like to start with\nJustice Scalia's line of questions about whether there\nhas been a repeal of the right to go to district court\non discrimination claims. And I think our starting\npoint is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is\n28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB\ndecisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit. This\ncourt is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in\nvarious cases over of the last 25 years has seen that\nthat is an exclusive grant of judicial review of\njurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final\ndecisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the\nonly exception to that is for the subset of final board\ndecisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2). And if you\nlook at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board\ndecision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's\nbrief is to judicially reviewable actions under section\n7702. Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase\njudicially reviewable action and the reason we do that\nis because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase\nis only ever used either in or in reference to section\n7702.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, does that mean\nthat it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is\nthrown out on a procedural ground.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It means that it's not a\njudicially reviewable action under 7702.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I\nmean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural\nobjections all the time and we think of those as\njudicially reviewable. It's -- it's a real stretch to\nsay simply because it says \"judicially reviewable\" it\nmeans judicially reviewable on the merits.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, in our view, again,\nbecause it uses the phrase \"judicially reviewable\naction\" under 7702 and that phrase \"judicially\nreviewable action\" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever\nused when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our\nview that's the signal that that's a term of art in this\ncontext.\nSo although dismissal on procedural grounds\nis a board action subject to judicial review, in our\nview it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702.\nAnd so you need to look at 7702 to see how --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you say that\nagain?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little more\nslowly.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes. A procedural\ndismissal by the board is a final board action that's\nsubject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's subject\nto judicial review.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, the next -\nMS. HARRINGTON: But it does not fall within\nthe term of art \"judicially reviewable action\" under\n7702.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So I thought\nthat your argument in the brief reduced to the question\nthat an action subject to judicial review in one section\nis not judicially reviewable in another. That's right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Say it again? I'm sorry?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HARRINGTON: This is going to happen a\nlot.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More slowly.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I\nthought I heard you to say, and this is what I\nunderstood your brief to say, that an action that is\nsubject to judicial review is not judicially reviewable\nunder 7703(b)(2).\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's right. It does not\nfall within --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. HARRINGTON: -- the exception to\nexclusive --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a tough\nargument.\nMS. HARRINGTON: -- review.\nIt's a tough statute. In our view, our\nargument is the best reading of the overall statute.\nAnd again, because we think \"judicially reviewable\naction\" under 7702 is sort of the linchpin phrase in\n7703(b)(2), we want to look to 7702 to how the phrase\n\"judicially reviewable action\" is used by Congress in\nthat statute, and the relevant pages here are page 8a\nand 9a in the statutory appendix to the Government's\nbrief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a couple\nquestions?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the Federal Circuit\nwas created, this language preexisted its creation,\ncorrect?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you tell me how\nwhen Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the\nsystem that you are advocating when it had no idea that\nit would ever create the Federal Circuit?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, I have two answers.\nThe first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases\nwhere this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl\nand Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has\ninterpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it\nexists today directs review of board decisions to the\nFederal Circuit.\nBut the second answer is, even for that\nbrief window after the CSRA was enacted before the\nFederal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken\naway jurisdiction from district courts over board\ndecisions and had directed them to the courts of\nappeals. And this Court recognized in Fausto that that\n-- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted\nthe CSRA. It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction\nin all the district courts throughout the country over\nFederal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a\nlayer of review and direct them to fewer courts. Now --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That still doesn't\nanswer my question, which is: Assuming there is no\nFederal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists\nin 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable\njudicial review, used not in the manner that you're\ndescribing.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I disagree, Your Honor. I\nmean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would\nindicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB\nfinal decisions reviewed in district court. And again,\nwe don't need to assume that the Federal Circuit doesn't\nexist today because it does, and that's how this Court\nhas construed the statute for the last 25 years, ever\nsince the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Harrington, go back\nto the question that the Chief Justice asked you,\nbecause the question was: Should we read \"judicially\nreviewable action\" as something different from action\nsubject to judicial review, which is how you would\nnormally read that language, as something different from\njust final agency action that you can take to a court.\nNot saying which court, that you can just take to a\ncourt.\nAnd you're asking us -- you said it's a term\nof art. So I guess the next question is: How do you\nget the definition of the term of art that you say\nexists in this statute?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, you look at 7702, and\nlet me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's\na term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that\nit has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702.\nThat's in the text of 7703(b)(2).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, it has to be an action\nthat -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a\ncertain number of days to take it to a court. So that's\nthe normal way you would read that language.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you say no, it really,\nyou know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not\nother kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that\nit's really a switch as to which court you get to take\nthe action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to\nread this language.\nSo I guess I'm asking you: Where do you\nfind the definition of the term of art? And I think\nwhat your answer is going to be is this notion the board\nshall decide the issue of discrimination and the\napplicable action; is that correct.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Can I just take you\nback one sentence to say, the point is not just that\nthe board is done, the point is that the board is done\nunder 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702,\nand so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that\nprovision Congress specifies various points at which a\nfinal board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially\nreviewable action.\nThe one that's relevant in this case is in\nsubsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of\nthe page there. It says: \"Any decision of the board\nunder paragraph (1)\" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- \"of this\nsubsection shall be a judicially reviewable action,\neither when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek\nEEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case.\"\nSo in our view there are two indications in\n(a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the\nissue of discrimination in order to be a judicially\nreviewable action -- action under section 7702.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't the language\nthat Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the\nboard within 120 days decide both the issue of\ndiscrimination and the appealable action, mean that the\nboard has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination\nand the appealable action, not that it must actually\nadjudicate those two issues?\nWhat if you have a threshold, you have a\nthreshold timeliness issue that is completely\ndispositive? You're saying that this language means the\nboard nevertheless has to decide the merits of the\ndiscrimination issue?\nMS. HARRINGTON: No. I'm glad you asked\nthat question. The directive in section -- that you're\nreferring to is at the bottom of page 8a. The directive\nis that the board shall decide both the issue of\ndiscrimination and the appealable action in accordance\nwith the board's appellate procedures.\nIn this case the board complied with that\ndirective by not deciding the issue of discrimination\nbecause the appeal was untimely. And I know that sounds\na little strange when I first say it, so let me give you\nan analogous example. Imagine a State law that directed\nthe DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in\naccordance -- in accordance with the procedures\ngoverning such applications. If the DMV required that\ndriver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit\nto an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have\nto issue a license to someone who refused to comply with\nthose requirements. In that case the DMV would comply\nwith the directive that it issue a license in accordance\nwith its procedures by not issuing a license at all.\nAnd it's the same thing here. Here the\nboard complied with the directive that it decide the\nissue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate\nprocedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination\nand therefore not issuing a decision under 7703.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to read it\nthat way, do you? I mean, look, it says in (a), it\nsays, let's take an employee who is affected adversely,\nand then it says \"alleges that the basis for the action\nwas discrimination,\" okay. In that case the board shall\nwithin 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination\nand the appealable action. So they decided it. They\ndecided it was out of time. They decided it was barred.\nThey decided da, da, da.\nI mean, there are a lot of decisions on an\nissue that a person raises in court and we don't\nnormally say they didn't decide the issue, the court.\nIt decided it. It decided it was untimely.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But I think normally when a\ncourt dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't\nthink of it as deciding the issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, I see. The\nissue. They shall decide the issue of discrimination.\nI mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide\nthe merits or you could read it as saying, there could\nbe several claims that went on below. Heard them,\ndecide the discrimination one. Now, you decide the\ndiscrimination one. And I agree they used the word\n\"issue\" instead of saying decide the discrimination\nclaim, that it says here, he alleges. They could have\nsaid, decide the allegation. They could have said,\ndecide that part of the case.\nBut, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14\nhurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word\nissue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a\nnew jurisprudence arising.\nIs the dismissal on the ground that it was an\nallegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to\nreally make out discrimination? It was partial summary\njudgment. It was a dismissal on the basis of the\nstatement in the complaint. It was -- I mean, we can\nthink of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to\nbe hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural,\njurisdictional or on the merits.\nAnd why do we want to get courts into that, when\nthe simplest thing is the person says, I allege\ndiscrimination. There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of\nhis paper. The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on\nthat particular one, and now we go to the district\ncourt. That's just so simple.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That would certainly be\nsimpler. And if it were up to us to make up the rules,\nmaybe that's what we would decide.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. All we're\ndoing is interpreting what you've said is the word\nissue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on\nthe merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're\ninterpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he\nhas raised that he was discriminated against.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But what we're trying to do\nis figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted\nto create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's\nexclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions.\nIn our view, its choice of the word issue is\nimportant, because it's not just deciding the case that\nalleges discrimination. It's the issue of\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nThere's another hint in paragraph (a)(3),\nand let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the\ndirection to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3),\nanother hint that Congress was really talking about\ncases where the board decides the issue of\ndiscrimination.\nIn paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a),\nCongress provides that a judicially reviewable action\nbecomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when\nthe employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or\nwhen the EEOC decides not to take the case.\nNow, the only types of decisions from the\nboard that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach\nan issue of discrimination. And so it would be strange\nto be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC\ncould review if you're talking about decisions that\ndon't involve the issue of discrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Harrington, may I\njust clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB,\nand the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit\nagrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed,\nthat's the end of the case, the discrimination claim\nwould never be heard then.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I mean, the plaintiffs\ncould then file a suit in district court and seek\nequitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file\nfrom the date of the final agency decision.\nAnd, in fact, that was one of the\nalternative bases for jurisdiction that was asserted in\nthe district court below in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the Plaintiff then\ngoes to the district court, then what position does the\nGovernment take?\nMS. HARRINGTON: It depends on the case. In\nthis case, we argued against equitable tolling because,\nin our view, she had missed the deadlines through her\nown fault. But if there was some reason to think that\nit wasn't really her fault for missing the deadlines for\nappealing and -- so that even though her appeal to the\nMSPB was, in fact, untimely, it wasn't really her fault,\nthen we might not resist equitable tolling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper told us in\nhis brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the\nMSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the\nstatute, that they think that the so-called mixed case\ngoes to the district court.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I don't think that's\ncorrect. I didn't hear him say that; but, if he said\nthat, I don't think -- I mean, I know it's not correct\nthat the EEOC and MSPB disagree with --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, didn't -- in the\nBallentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that\nit didn't go to the Federal circuit?\nMS. HARRINGTON: That was our position, you\nknow, I think it was 30 years ago now. And since the\nBallentine decision, the Government has had the other --\nhas had the position that we're asserting today, which\nis that the only --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so you -- are you --\nare you telling us that the position you're representing\non behalf of the Government is the position that the\nMSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC\nwould take today?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Yes. Our brief is\nfiled on behalf of all the agencies in the United States\nthat are affected by this.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, getting\nback to judicially reviewable -\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Excellent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even if I accept\nyour argument that that's not the same as subject to\njudicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get\nto your position?\nThis is not something about -- a provision\nabout what's judicially reviewable and what's not. It's\na notice provision. It says these actions have to be\nfiled within 30 days after notice of judicial review.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, but some --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then you say\nthat judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that\nbases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence\nabout notice.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But it's in a provision\nthat's describing the exception to the general rule\nthat's set out in 7703.\nSo the general rule in 7703 is that when\nyou're talking about final board decisions, judicial\nreview of those decisions is in the Federal circuit.\nAnd this is at 16(a) and 17(a) in the Government's\nbrief. It says, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2).\nSo when you're looking to (b)(2), you're\nwondering -- you're asking what subset of final board\nactions -- that's -- final order or decision -- that's\ntheir language used in (a)(1) -- what subset of final\norders or decisions of the Merit Systems Protection\nBoard fall within (b)(2).\nNow, in (b)(2), the only types of final\norders that are described there is at the end of the\nsection, judicially reviewable action under section\n7702.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yes, that's\nwhere the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way\nto establish that that is the critical element that\ntells you which provisions you can take forward when it\njust says your time is 30 days after you get notice of\njudicial review.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Under --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And here the\nGovernment says, aha, judicial review, we think that\ndoes not mean subject to judicial review. Judicially\nreviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review.\nMS. HARRINGTON: So even if you throw out\nthe term of art --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. HARRINGTON: -- part of our argument, and all\nyou look at is the last two words of that sentence,\nwhich is Section 7702, you still have to look at 7702\nand figure out when Congress told you that a final board\ndecision could be subject to judicial review.\nAnd the relevant place for this case where\nit did that is in section (a)(3), which is on page 9a.\nAnd there again, it points at (a)(1), which directs that\nthe Board decide the issue of discrimination. So it\nsays a decision under (a)(1) is -- is judicially\nreviewable. If a decision does not reach the issue of\ndiscrimination, it is not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As of. See, it\nshall be reviewable action as of. Again, it's just\ngoing to the timeliness.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Right. But again -- but\nthe two time triggers would only come into play if a\ndecision reached an issue of discrimination, because the\nEEOC can't review issues -- can't review dismissals on\njurisdictional or procedural grounds. It can only --\nthe EEOC's review of the board's -- of a board decision\nis limited to its review of the board's interpretation\nof an anti-discrimination law or its application of\nthose laws to a particular case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, would you\nagree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress\ntrying to accomplish this objective? I mean, if\nCongress were really saying we don't want procedural\ndeterminations to go to the district court, that's a\nvery easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send\nyou -- you know, involve six different cross-references\nand unnatural reading of statutory language.\nAnd, you know, in the end, your argument\njust is based on this notion that Congress used the word\ndecide rather than dispose of in this single provision.\nThe argument would completely collapse if that were not\nthe case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what\nyou say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in\nthis extremely complicated and backhanded way.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I'm not going to\nresist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated. I\nmean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they\nhave remarked about how it is a complex statutory\nscheme.\nBut I think Congress did accomplish in a\npretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing\nthat procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal\ncircuit, and it did that by making that the background\nrule.\nIn 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final\ndecisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal\ncircuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2).\nAnd then the question is, well, which of those decisions\nfall within (b)(2).\nIn our view, you should not read that\nexception more broadly than necessary to accommodate\nemployees' rights to have their discrimination claims\ndetermined de novo in district court.\nHere, the board decision, it decided two\nthings. First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board\ntimely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her\nuntimeliness. There is no reason to think that Congress\nwould have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed\nanywhere other than the Federal circuit. The whole\npoint of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified\nbody of law governing certain things in the country that\nCongress really thought should be directed to one place,\nand that included board decisions.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not -- the\nFederal circuit didn't exist at the time that these\nstatutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it\nwould have been taken to the various courts of appeals,\nand you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Right, but you would have\nhad more uniformity than you would have had if the cases\nhad continued to go to the district court, which is\nwhat -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and\nCongress specifically wanted to stop that process.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't have a quarrel\nwith your opposing counsel's position that once the\nBoard decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination\nclaim, the district court reviews both?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Alito was\nquestioning that, but you don't quarrel with that.\nMS. HARRINGTON: We don't quarrel with it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the lack of\nuniformity is inherent in this structure. You just want\nto carve out one piece of it that --\nMS. HARRINGTON: No --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you say deserves\nmore uniformity.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It is -- it is true that a\nsmall range of procedural issues governing the board's\nprocedures might be heard in district court, but it is\ntruly a very small universe of issues bordering on\nnon-existent, and let me explain why. As suggested\nhere, the only reason -- the only way it would come up\nis as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a\ndefense of exhaustion. But then generally speaking it\nwould have to be a procedural issue that the Government,\nthat the agency raised before the board and the board\nrejected.\nNow, the board's own regulations allow the\nboard to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory\nrequirements, including timeliness, for good cause. And\nso the Government would have to argue in the district\ncourt that essentially the board abused its discretion\nby not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very\nhigh hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very\nmany cases in which that's going to come up, where the\nGovernment's going to make that kind of argument. So\nalthough there's -- there's potential, there's a\npotential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under\nour view, it is really a small universe of issues that\ncould go to district court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything you want\nto say on the question of which is worse? That is to\nsay, I get your point on the word \"issue,\" and I think\nyou can read the word \"issue\" to say there is a\ncontested point as to whether there was discrimination\nor to say there is a contested point between the parties\nas to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a --\nhas a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower --\nthe agency reversed on the issue of discrimination.\nThe latter way favors your opponent, the\nformer favors you; okay. So we could do either, I\nguess.\nThe one way, if you win, there will be a\nbody of law about what counts as procedural and what\ndoesn't. That sounds confusing to me. If you lose, I\nquite agree with you that there will then be different\ncourts deciding different procedural matters, where\nyou'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit.\nOkay. Do you have anything to say about which of those\ntwo evils is worse? Is there any reason --\nMS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have we any way of knowing?\nMS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think Congress\nmade the determination.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- going back to the\nlanguage, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think\nthe language at best might be read, that word \"issue,\"\nthe way you say, but need not be.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But I think you can resolve\nthe ambiguity in the use of the word \"issue\" by looking\nat the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision\nunder (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC. I don't\nthink there is any dispute that the EEOC can only review\nboard decisions that involve an issue of discrimination,\neither an interpretation of an antidiscrimination law or\nan application of such a law to the facts of the case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a problem,\nbecause to accept your reading is to say that judicially\nreviewable action differs between 7702 and the escape\nhatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work,\nit, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the\nprovisions you are relying on do. Under your reading\nboth should be given identical meaning, because they\nboth cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no,\nwe shouldn't have that absurd result.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But not because --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that if\nyou concede that there is an absurd result in applying\nyour interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition,\nyour meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, so just to be clear,\nwe think the phrase \"judicially reviewable action\"\nshould be given the same meaning in section (e) that it\nis given elsewhere in 7702.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the board --\nMS. HARRINGTON: Our view is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when does the time\nframes of the escape hatch commence --\nMS. HARRINGTON: So --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if the board hasn't\nrendered any decision on anything?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Exactly. If the -- if the\nappeal is still pending before the board, that's when\nthe escape hatch of (e) comes in, because it's just\nintended to prevent employees from being held hostage by\nboard inaction.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right, but Justice Sotomayor\nis right, that when you define \"judicially reviewable\naction\" in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes\nnonsensical and you have to save it by inserting\nadditional language, by saying, you know, \"and other\" --\n\"and other kinds of action.\"\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, it only becomes\nnonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that\nare no longer pending before the board under section\n7702. In our view, once the board issued a decision --\nthe decision in this case, it issued a decision under\nsection 7701 which is the general provision governing\nboard decisions, and then the case was no longer pending\nunder section 7702. And so it wouldn't make sense to\napply the escape hatch to cases in that situation.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it wouldn't make\nsense, but it's what the language would command if\n\"judicially reviewable action\" means what you say\n\"judicially reviewable action\" means.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It is true that our\ncommonsense gloss on the statute is not found in the\ntext of the statute. But I think once the -- once the\ncase has been decided under section 7701 on procedural\ngrounds, it's no longer a 7702 case before the board.\nAnd so there is just no reason to think that subsection\n(e) would apply in the -- in that situation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still have an\nexhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to\nthe district court?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, we raised that\nexhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the\ndistrict court. The district court construed this case\nas seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking\nreview of the agency's decision. Petitioner did not\nchallenge that district court holding before the eighth\ncircuit in her opening brief. She didn't flag that as\nissue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although\nnow she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case --\nthis Court maybe should really just decide whether she's\nseeking review of the agency decision instead of the\nboard decision, in our view that's not really a question\nthat is presented in -- in the case any longer. In our\nview she is seeking review over the board decision, the\nboard decision decided that her appeal was untimely,\nthat there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness.\nThere is no indication anywhere in the statute that\nCongress would have wanted that kind of board decision\nto be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal Circuit.\nAnd so in our view it does not fall within -- in the\nexception to exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction\nprovided in (b)(2) because it does not decide the issue\nof discrimination.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nHarrington.\nMr. Schnapper you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI would like to answer the question that the\nChief Justice asked yesterday morning in Lozman. You --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better remind\nme.\n(Laughter).\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I -- I am happy to do so,\nYour Honor. You pointed out that -- that where subject\nmatter jurisdiction is concerned, is it important that\nrules be clear? And you asked counsel for Respondent,\nwhy was Respondent's rule clearer than the Petitioner's\nrule?\nIn this case our rule is demonstrably\nclearer. The question is which mixed-cases go to the\ndistrict court? Our answer is all. The Government's\nanswer, the rule that is derived from Ballentine, has\nconfounded the lower courts since Ballentine and those\nproblems are reflected in the divergent accounts of the\nrule in the Government's brief. There are more than\nhalf a dozen of these problems.\nFirst, the courts are divided below, as is\nthe Government's brief, about whether the Government's\nrule applies to all procedural issues or only to\nprocedural issues that arise before the court reaches\nthe merits. For example, in -- in Hopkins v. MSPB,\nafter the court had resolved the merits, there was a\ndispute about counsel fees and an argument that the\ncounsel fee application was untimely. The Government\ntook the position that that timeliness issue belonged in\nthe district court.\nSecondly, the lower courts are divided as is\nthe Government's brief about whether a procedural issue\nthat is related to or intertwined with the merits goes\nto the district court or the court of appeals. There is\na line of cases holding that a -- a -- when the MSPB\nholds there is no jurisdiction because the\ndiscrimination claim is frivolous, that's a procedural\njurisdiction issue, it's not a merits issue. And if you\nlook at the opinion in Hill v. Department of the Air\nForce, you see a lengthy description of Title VII law,\nin McDonnell Douglas v. Green, in the course of a\ndecision by the Federal Circuit holding there is no\njurisdiction.\nThird, it is unclear what constitutes the\nline between a merits decision and a procedural decision\nissue. Some things are really neither. For example,\nthere are recurring disputes about whether a settlement\nwas voluntary. Well, it's not the merits of the\ndiscrimination case, but it's not procedural in any\nnormal sense of the word.\nFourth, there are cases which involve\nseveral claims resolved on several different bases. We\nnoted some of them in our reply brief. One -- one claim\nwas rejected on jurisdictional grounds; one claim was\nrejected on res judicata and one claim was decided by\nthe board on the merits. It's unclear how that would\ngo.\nThere are also situations in which two cases\nget filed, one of which -- and they are related cases,\nand they go to the same judge, and one -- one involved\nan MSPB decision on procedural grounds, one on the\nmerits. The court in that case just thought it ought to\njust keep them both. It's not clear how that comes out.\nFourth -- some, sorry, fifth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Fifth.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Sometimes within the MSPB --\nyou have the point. I don't mean to belabor. Thank\nyou, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I -- I just\n--\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Oh, that was -- I didn't\nmean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He was just keeping score.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I\nthink -- I think we are at six.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Checking them off.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The MS -- the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are on number\nfive.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Okay. The -- the -- an\nMSPB, ALJ, or the board itself could resolve a claim on\nalternative grounds, as judges do all the time, and say,\nwell, we think this is time barred, but we also find\nthat it lacks the merits. I know where that goes.\nThere is also a problem, which the briefs\naddress, about factual disputes that arise with regard\nto jurisdiction or procedure. The -- 7703(c) says,\n\"Questions of fact get decided de novo.\" What does that\nmean?\nIf there -- let's take, for example, a case\nin which the claim is that a charge wasn't filed on time\nwith the agency. That's a question of fact. The agency\nmight find that it was timely -- there could be a\ndispute of fact about when the violation occurred which\ntriggers the limitation period. The agency would make a\nfinding of fact. The MSPB might affirm that finding.\nThe Government tells us they would affirm whatever the\nagency did. The statute seems to say that's got to be\ndecided de novo, the Federal circuit can't do that.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
