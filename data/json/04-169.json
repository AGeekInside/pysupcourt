        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Graham County Soil & Water Conservation District\nv. the United States.\nMr. Browning.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether Congress\nexpressly provided for a limitations period for\nretaliatory discharge action under the Federal False\nClaims Act.\nThe 6-year limitation period set out in section\n3731(b) of the act is tied to a violation of section 3729,\nthat is, the submission of a fraudulent claim to the\nGovernment. The triggering event to start the statute of\nlimitations running under section 3731(b) is a violation\nof section 3729. Because a violation of section 3729 is\nnot an element of the cause of action for retaliatory\ndischarge, Congress did not intend to provide a\nlimitations period in section 3731(b) for a retaliatory\ndischarge action.\nThe Government in its amicus brief argues that\nCongress must have intended a uniform limitation period so\nthat all three actions created by the False Claims Act\ncould be brought in the same proceeding. The -- the\nGovernment's argument undermines the very purpose of the\nFederal False Claims Act and the retaliatory discharge\nprovision.\nThe retaliatory discharge provision, section\n3730(h) of the False Claims Act, not only protects people\nwho blow the whistle, the initial whistleblower, but it\nexpressly protects people who testify at trial. And we\nhave seen time and again in many of these cases the\nGovernment will keep a case under seal for 5, 6, 7 years.\nWe've seen repeatedly situations, because of the\ncomplexity of the underlying violation of the false claim,\nthat it might take a decade from when the complaint is\nfiled to when the case actually is put before a jury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Browning, this argument\nthat you're making, where you seem to be having great\nsolicitude for the -- for the whistleblowers, for the\npeople who might be retaliated against -- the respondent\nand the Solicitor General answer your argument by saying\nin all the years that 3730(h) retaliation claims have been\navailable, there has been no instance of qui tam plaintiff\nbarred because the retaliation occurred outside the 6-\nyear limitation. Yes, one could hypothesize these cases,\nbut are there any actual cases where the retaliation in\nfact fell outside the 6-year, dated from the submission of\nthe false claim?\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, I cannot cite\nto a specific situation where that has occurred, and the\nGovernment, you're right, makes very much of the argument\nthat this is simply hypothetical. But it is a very real\nand concrete problem when you have cases that go to trial,\nthat it takes so long to go to trial, and those people who\nare testifying at trial have no protection because it's\nmore than 6 years from the violation of section 3729. I\n-- I would --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe they don't get\nretaliated against if they testify at trial.\nMR. BROWNING: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if the question is\nwhether there is a problem out there in the real world on\n-- for people whose interest is certainly not identical to\nyours.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I recognize that, but\nyou have to look at the statute as a whole to construe it\nin its proper context. And there are many situations\nwhere there -- a number of years pass from -- from when\nthe complaint is filed to when the testimony takes place\nat trial. And -- and as the amicus brief of the National\nWork Right Institute points out, an organization that's\ndesigned to protect the human rights of employees, an\norganization that's a spin-off of the American Civil\nLiberties Union, that organization clearly views the\ninterpretation advocated by the respondents and adopted by\nthe Fourth Circuit as detrimental by employees.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. All that's true,\nbut the question that I think Justice Ginsburg asked was\nyou have on your side the whole National Defense\nIndustrial Association. You have the Equal Employment\nAdvisory Council that represents dozens and dozens, I take\nit, of businesses. We have your own client. We have you\nin the firm. Everybody. I imagine you all racked your\nbrains to say has there ever been such an example, and I\ntake the answer is no, never. Not all of you could even\nfind one instance where this happened. Now, am I right?\nBecause that's what I think unless you provide the\nexample.\nMR. BROWNING: I cannot cite a specific example.\nJustice Breyer, I would direct your attention to the case\nin the Eleventh Circuit, Childray v. UAPGA, in which 4-\nand-a-half years had passed between when the initial\nallegation of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So -- so what would be\nso unreasonable about a Member of Congress concluding the\nfollowing? We want these things to end after 6 years, you\nknow? And there's never been an example of this horrible\nthat you think of, and so we are going to end them all\nafter 6 years from the time the thing took place, the\ncheat took place. And that's it. And if there's some\nother problem of the kind you're worried about that comes\nup, we will worry about that later through amendment,\ntolling, et cetera. Why is that an -- we don't want 30-\nday statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of\nlimitations. We want 6 years. That helps most people.\nAnd if there's an odd case that doesn't, we'll worry about\nit. What's the answer to that?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, if Congress had\nsaid that, they certainly could have made that decision,\nbut it would run completely contrary to almost 200 years\nof precedent from this Court that as a general rule, the\nlimitations period does not begin to run before your cause\nof action even comes into existence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's true, it would be.\nAnd the reason we're doing it is because there's a period\nof time when somebody lies to the Government and we don't\nwant actions that are related to that. We'll have to go\ninto that proof to take place more than 6 years later.\nNow, that would be the reason, and I agree it would be\ncontrary. But the difficulty for me is the language seems\nto point to that reason.\nMR. BROWNING: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I can't find that reason\nidiotic.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't\nthink the language points to that because the language of\nthe limitations period, 3731(b), which is set out in the\nappendix to the cert petition at page 135a -- the language\nof the statute is a civil action under section 3730 may\nnot be brought more than 6 years after the date of the\nviolation of section 3729.\nThere are two material aspects of -- of the\nstatutory language: the violation of section 3729, which\nis not an element of the cause of action --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I -- I don't mean to\ninterrupt, but it is true that this is a civil action\nthat's brought under 3730(h), is it not?\nMR. BROWNING: The -- the action is brought\nunder 3730(h), and Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it is literally within the\nplain language of the statute.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, it is and it isn't. It is\nclearly in 3730(h), but when you look at the False Claims\nAct, Congress has used the phrase, an action under 3730,\nto mean different things in various portions throughout\nthe False Claims Act. Congress has used that phrase on\nsix different occasions, and I would particularly direct\nthe Court's attention to 3731(c). In -- in that\nprovision, Congress has provided that in an action brought\nunder section 3730, the United States must prove the\nelements of the cause of action by a preponderance of the\nevidence. The respondent and the Government say you must\nhave this literal reading of section -- the phrase, an\naction under 3730, and it means all three causes of action\nin 3731(b), but that -- but when you turn to 3731(c), that\nvirtually identical phrase appears and you have to read\nthat statutory provision in context, and read in\ncontext --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems -- it seems if you\nread a provision like this, it says what the United States\nwould be required to prove. Implicit in -- in that is in\nany action brought by the United States under 3730. I\nthink -- think (c) is clearly talking about cases in which\nthe United States is bringing the action.\nMR. BROWNING: Exactly, Justice Ginsburg. You\nhave to read it in context, and I think when you read\n3731(b) in context and that limitations period is tied to\na violation of section 3729, it is clear that Congress did\nnot intend the phrase, an action under 3730, to -- to\ninclude a retaliatory discharge action in which a\nviolation of section --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't think that's at\nall as clear as that (c) is directed to cases brought by\nthe United States for the reason that Justice Breyer just\nexplained. Congress might want to have one 6-year\nlimitation and say, well, maybe there would be this\nhypothetical case that you're worried about, but for the\nmost part, 6 years will take care of everybody.\nMR. BROWNING: And, Justice Ginsburg, my point\nis just as section 3731(c) is not intended to cover all of\nthe causes of action under the False Claims Act, 3731(b)\nis not intended to cover all of the actions under the\nFalse Claims Act as well, that it's only intended to cover\nthe causes of action in which a violation of section 3729\nis an element of the cause of action.\nThe -- the Government makes the argument that\nyou need a uniform limitations period so these actions can\nbe tried together, but the Government ignores the fact\nthat a qui tam action or an action brought by the\nGovernment is a completely different cause of action than\nan action for retaliatory discharge action. They involve\ndifferent substantive claims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's true, but is it also\nnot true that some of the people who get retaliated\nagainst may be the same people who bring the qui tam\naction?\nMR. BROWNING: In some cases, that is -- is the\ncase, Justice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if they don't get the --\nrecover as being the victim of retaliation, they may still\nget a very handsome reward for what happened to them.\nMR. BROWNING: That is the case, but -- but I\nalso want to point out that in many cases, the person who\nbrings the qui tam action is a completely different\nplaintiff than the person who brings the retaliatory\ndischarge action. The example of someone who is\nretaliated against for testifying at trial -- in that\nsituation, it's clearly going to be a different plaintiff\nthan the plaintiff who brought the original qui tam\naction.\nIt can also be a different defendant. Section\n3730(h) is intended to preclude an industry from\nblacklisting an employee. So if an employee brings a qui\ntam action while at one employer and subsequently leaves\nand go to -- goes to work for a second employer, when the\nsecond employer recognizes or -- or learns that this\nemployee had previously been involved in an investigation\nunder the False Claims Act, that second employer is\nprecluded from retaliating against the -- the employee.\nSo --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In the real world, do we have\nsuch cases?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. I cannot cite\nto a specific case, but I'm aware that that is very much a\nissue that practitioners face day in and day out.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Another real-world question.\nDo we -- do we have any -- do you have any experience that\nyou can rely on either to show that in fact these\nsubsection (h) claims are brought customarily with the\nmain qui tam action or, conversely, that they are brought\nseparately? Do we know what's going on?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. It is a real\nmix, that on many cases you will see a retaliatory\ndischarge action brought independently, and in other cases\nyou'll see the qui tam action and the retaliation action\nbrought simultaneously.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In connection with what's\nincluded and what isn't included, the -- in that same 3731\nprovision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so\nexcludes (h). And if Congress had meant that with respect\nto the 6-year period, they could have said the same thing,\nthat it relates to (a) and (b) and not (h).\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I would recognize\nthat there is different language that Congress could have\n-- have chosen to state this in a different way, but --\nand you're right, that in section 3731(d), Congress did\nspecifically reference section 3730(a) and 3730(b), but\nCongress did not use that precision in drafting throughout\nthe Federal False Claims Act. Just -- there are a number\nof ambiguities that exist throughout the Federal False\nClaims Act. Congress even referred to the General\nAccounting Office as the Government Accounting Office.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They could have done the same\nin 3731(c) also. Instead of just saying any action\nbrought under section 3730, they could have said any\naction brought under -- which one? (a) of -- of -- which\nis the one that allows the Government suit?\nMR. BROWNING: 3730(a), Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (a). They could have said (a),\nand they didn't. They said all of 3730.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes. So -- so all you can really\ntake from the statute is that the phrase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sloppy --\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is what you can take.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. That you have\nto look at the context. You have to look at the meaning,\nand when you're dealing with a statute that is drafted in\na way that's sloppy, you have to look at what Congress\nreally intended, and when Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask you a\nquestion about the alternative? If we don't follow this\nstatute, you -- you refer to State law for the correct\ncause -- statute of limitations I guess.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I imagine because there\nare different forms of retaliation -- sometimes it's a\ndischarge, sometimes it might be slander by defaming the\nperson for his next employer, it might be a tort, they\nbeat him up or something, there could be a lot of\ndifferent kinds of retaliation -- each of which would give\nrise to a different statute of limitations under State\nlaw. Does that seem reasonable?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, this Court has\nfaced that situation with 1983 in a variety of contexts,\nand there are a number of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We had to make up a rule to\nfill a gap.\nMR. BROWNING: And -- and in North Carolina it's\neasy. It is basically a 3-year statute of limitations for\neverything. And for a retaliatory discharge action, you\nlook at the -- in North Carolina, you look at the\nlimitations period for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what about Wisconsin,\nMichigan, Illinois, and -- and Florida? Maybe they all\nhave different statutes and they have different kinds of\ncauses of action that may be relevant in the retaliation\ncase.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, that is certainly an\nissue. With respect to the parties in this case, that is\na matter that is clear and simple because North Carolina\nyou look to a retaliatory discharge action --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in our construction of\nthe statute, we have to think about its application\nthroughout the United States, not just in North -- North\nCarolina.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, and a rule that would apply\nthe residual limitation period for personal injury would\ncertainly be appropriate for a situation like this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it a necessary\nelement of a successful action for retaliatory discharge\nthat -- that the action under the False Claims Act have\nsucceeded?\nMR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor. The courts have\nrepeatedly held that for a retaliatory discharge action,\nit is not necessary to have a violation of section 3729.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does the Government\ncontend is to be done under (b)(1) when no violation of\nsection 3729 is committed?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, the way I read the\nGovernment's brief is they want to modify the language of\nsection 3731(b) by inserting the phrase alleged before the\nphrase, violation of section 3729.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But don't we have to do that\nanyway when -- when in fact a person brings an ordinary\nclaim? I mean, Joe Smith brings a claim that XYZ company\ncheated the Government. Now, that doesn't mean it was\ncommitted. It just means he says it was committed. After\nall, he might lose.\nMR. BROWNING: But -- but, Justice Breyer, when\nthe jury renders its verdict, if there is a violation of\nsection 3729 that's proven to exist, but that -- that\nproven violation is beyond the 6-year period, the\ndefendant would be entitled to judgment based upon the\naffirmative action --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean if in fact the\nplaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant\nin the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed\non statute of limitations grounds.\nMR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor. What I'm\nsaying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not because --\nbecause the word is committed there refers to the claim of\na plaintiff. Doesn't it?\nMR. BROWNING: What I'm -- what I'm saying is\nyou have to look at the facts that are ultimately proven\nat trial, and if the fact of the violation is more than 6\nyears from the filing of the cause of action, clearly\nthat's going to be barred by the limitations period. The\nword alleged does not appear in the statute, and the\nGovernment tries to -- they essentially confuse the issue\nby saying, well, you -- you could never -- a defendant\ncould never prevail on a motion to dismiss because you\nhave to look at the allegations for a motion to dismiss.\nBut that's the very nature --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it seems to me that if\n-- if there's no violation, then there's no triggering\nevent to start the statute of limitations running.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. That -- that's\nthe real problem, that even under the Government's\nreading, that there is not a triggering event. So when\nyou look at 3731(b) as a whole, when you try to discern\ncongressional intent, Congress intended a -- the\ntriggering event to be a violation of section 3729 which\ndoesn't apply to a retaliatory discharge action.\nYour Honor, the -- the statute here is worded in\nsuch a way that throughout the Federal False Claims Act,\nthere are a variety of ambiguities, but when you look at\nthe statute as a whole, when you look at the stated\npurpose that Congress had of protecting people who testify\nat trial, there is only one way to read the statute in a\nway that's harmonious, and that's to read it so that\n3731(b) only applies to section 3730(a) and 3730(b) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Browning, is it proper to\nconsider in the calculus that if you use 6 years from the\ndate the -- that the false claim was made or was alleged\nto be made, then you don't have to get into the question\nwhich State's statute of limitations, the choice of law\nquestion, and then when you identify that State, which\nlimitation period within that State? I mean, those are\ntwo inquiries which can sometimes be rather complicated.\nThey are obviated entirely if we take the 6 years from the\nFederal statute.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, you're\nabsolutely right, that if the respondents' and the Fourth\nCircuit's reading of the statute is correct, that Congress\ndid intend this bizarre result to take place for all three\ncauses of action, then you don't have to look to a State\nlaw cause of action to fill the gap.\nBut there are many circumstances where this\nCourt has recognized that you do -- when Congress has not\nexpressly provided a limitations period, the most\nappropriate vehicle is to look to the most closely\nanalogous State law cause of action. As a matter of fact,\none of the comparable situations here is ERISA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've done it for several\nhundred years, haven't we --\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for all Federal causes of\naction? We've -- we've looked to State --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When there is no statute of\nlimitations.\nMR. BROWNING: When -- when --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is Federal\nstatute. Is there one? And my question is deciding is\nthere one -- this is not something drawn from thin air.\nThere is a 6-year period right in the statute.\nMR. BROWNING: There -- there is a 6-year period\nand if that is applied by this Court to a retaliatory\ndischarge action, there will still be difficulties because\nyou will have situations where there is no violation of\nsection 3729. So when do you start the limitations period\nrunning?\nThe respondent would argue in their brief that\nyou start it running from when they believed that the\nviolation took place. So your -- the respondent is\narguing you're looking to the mental impression of the\nlitigant that would be the triggering device for the\nlimitations period.\nYour Honor, if there are no further questions,\nI'd reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nBrowning.\nMr. Hurt, we'll hear -- we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK HURT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HURT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe text of this statute could not be more clear\non this issue. A retaliation claim is a civil action\nunder section 3730, and a civil action under 3730 is\nsubject to a 6-year limitations period.\nPetitioners argue, in effect, that the Court\nshould disregard the plain language here and claim that\nCongress really meant that only two of the three causes of\naction under section 3730, should be subject to the 6-\nyear limitations period, those brought under sections (a)\nand (b), and that Congress told us this indirectly by\nchanging the limitations trigger -- this simply makes no\nsense for two reasons.\nFirst, there is no reason why Congress would\nhave limited the scope of the limitations period in such a\ncryptic manner. In paragraph (d) as Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sloppiness. Sloppiness. How\nabout that as a reason, sloppiness that appears throughout\nthe rest of this -- of this piece of legislation?\nMR. HURT: Well, I -- I would propose that if\nCongress really wanted this trigger, wanted that uniform\nlimitations period, they really couldn't have done this\nparticular provision, (b)(1), in a more clear way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do you know of -- of\nany other situation in which a -- a time limit is imposed\nthat has nothing whatever to do with the -- with the act\nthat the individual is complaining about, nothing whatever\nto do with the act --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and where the time\nlimit begins to run even before the act occurs?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before the act occurs.\nMR. HURT: The answer is no, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the time limit could have\nexpired before the act occurs. Right? So you get free\nretaliation after 6 years. Is that right?\nMR. HURT: Sometimes equitable doctrines might\napply, but the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, wait. What kind of an\nequitable doctrine?\nMR. HURT: For instance, if the employer\ndeliberately waited to retaliate until the 6 years has\npast, that could be an instance.\nBut the important thing is the retaliation\nprovision in the False Claims Act is unique because it's\ndesigned to be a companion or an add-on action to the qui\ntam action. That's -- if you look at the reported cases,\nthe vast majority of those cases show the two actions\nbrought together.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that one of the major\nthings they were concerned about was retaliation against\nwitnesses in the qui tam action, and that will always\noccur after. I mean, the -- the suit for retaliation will\nthen always occur after the qui tam action.\nMR. HURT: I believe the core concern is to\nincentivize the whistleblower. But take that particular\nsituation, the witness, and that concern. There are other\nlaws and other causes of actions that will protect the\nwitness in that situation. For instance, section 1985.\nThis Court in Hadel v. Harrison ruled that a witness who\nis retaliated against at a Federal trial does have a\nsection 1985 action.\nHere, Congress was focusing on the\nwhistleblower, encouraging him to bring this qui tam\naction. In fact, he's only protected for activities that\nare -- the -- the statute says, in furtherance of an\naction under this section. That is pointing to the qui\ntam action.\nAnd there's all kinds of problems that arise if\nthese two actions are not brought together if the\nretaliation action must be brought first.\nFirst, if you accept the petitioner's view,\nyou're going to have situations where as little as 180\ndays -- they have 180 days like in Florida to bring this\nretaliation action. Once that's gone, the -- the\nwhistleblower has possibly 6 years to bring this qui tam\naction, but no incentive from the retaliation action,\nwhich was one of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hurt, can you -- can you\ngo back a few steps? Because there was a difference\nbetween an answer that you gave and one that Mr. Browning\ngave. He said it's a mixed bag, the litigation of whether\nit's brought in one action and the whistleblower is making\nboth claims or whether the retaliation claim is saved out\nand brought in a separate action. You said the vast\nmajority of the cases involve the whistleblower asserting\nboth claims in a single action. Which characterization is\nright? Mixed bag or vast majority?\nMR. HURT: Well, the SG's office informed us\nthat they did a search of the reported cases. In the\nmajority of those cases, the -- the claims were brought\ntogether. The SG, I think, can give you the details on\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: All right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're now saying majority, not\nvast majority.\nMR. HURT: Okay. I think it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait for the SG.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HURT: But they point out -- they realized,\nI think, petitioners, that this is a problem that -- that\nthis is a unique act, and they -- and they point out --\nthey make the claim that the Major Fraud Act somehow\nrenders this not unique. That's a criminal statute and it\ndoesn't have a qui tam action.\nEvery retaliation claim is going to be based in\npart on an alleged violation of section 3729.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're reading alleged into\n-- into (b)(1). Right? Sure, it will always be based on\nan alleged violation. So it doesn't have to be a\nviolation.\nMR. HURT: Well, no. I think that ignores how\nstatute of limitations are actually construed by courts.\nYou can write a statute basically two ways. You can put\nthe violation as the trigger or you can put the act,\nalleged to be a violation. Courts apply those\nidentically.\nAnd for instance, if you have a summary judgment\nmotion by a qui tam -- qui tam defendant, which we always\nagree that this statute (b)(1) applies, all the defendant\nhas to do is point out the act alleged to be a false claim\nfalls outside of the 6-year period, and he wins. He\ndoesn't have -- no one has to show whether the actual\nclaim itself was false or not. So I think, you know, as\nJustice Breyer points out, this is the way you universally\nconstrue statute of limitations.\nHaving the same trigger for all three 3730\nactions means the limitations period starts for all three\nat the same time. This makes it easier for the\nwhistleblower to bring both their qui tam and retaliation\nactions together. If she's forced to bring the\nretaliation action first, then if she misses that, then\nshe's got no incentive to then go on and bring the qui tam\naction from the -- the incentive from this whistleblower\naction, which is the key purpose of it.\nAlso, if she has to bring the -- the retaliation\naction first before the qui tam action, then what will\nhappen, if she's not ready to bring the qui tam action --\nthese can be very complicated allegations, complicated\ndefense contract -- then what will happen is she will most\nlikely have to split her claim. And that exposes the\nwhistleblower to all kinds of -- of pitfalls. For\ninstance --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hurt, what -- what about\nthe argument that unlike most retaliation situations, here\nif you take that 6-year period, which is much longer than\nthe general run of retaliation statutes take it, then you\nwould have a qui tam plaintiff who waits while the back\npay is mounting, and so you can have an exorbitant\napplication both with respect to the amount of back pay\nand the claim for reinstatement. 5 years down the road --\nI haven't worked with this company now -- I'm going to\ninsist they take me back, be reinstated. That -- that\nconcern, that on your reading there is the potential for\nmuch larger damages and much more disruptive reinstatement\nthan is usually the case.\nMR. HURT: I think that that type of situation\nis just so highly unlikely. It doesn't really comport\nwith the realities of what whistleblowers are thinking\nabout. For instance, in this case, Ms. Wilson didn't come\nforward until she saw no one else would come forward and\nremedy what she saw as theft from the U.S. Government.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't Justice\nGinsburg's question raised by your very argument, that you\ndon't want whistleblowers having to bring their\nwhistleblower actions before they are ready to bring their\nmain actions? And if it's going to take -- you've just\nsaid how difficult it may be to prepare one of these qui\ntam cases. If in fact you're right and it may take a\ncouple of years from the time the employer gets wind that\nsomething is going on and fires or does whatever, then in\nexactly that situation, the -- the whistleblower damages\nare going to be mounting during that period of 1 or 2 or\nwhatever years it may be before the qui tam action starts.\nSo on your hypothesis, it seems to me, you're going to get\njust the situation that Justice Ginsburg raised.\nMR. HURT: I think that -- I think there's a\nsplit in the lower courts about how the mitigation will\napply.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's -- let's first see\nabout your argument. Isn't that what your argument\nimplies?\nMR. HURT: I think that -- that that is a\npossible case, but I think that that's -- the priorities\nfor the Government and -- and Congress in drafting this\nlaw was to get money back for the Government. That's\ntheir number one concern here and to incentivize that\nwhistleblower. If it so happens that the whistleblower\ntakes much -- takes a long time to prepare his qui tam and\nbrings his -- his retaliation action at the same time and\nends up getting some more damages, I -- I think that ranks\nlow on the list of Congress' priorities in drafting this\nretaliation provision. It's the -- getting the\nGovernment's money back, giving the whistleblower\nprotection and an incentive to bring that qui tam claim is\nreally Congress' core concern here.\nAnd I think these other issues about damages\nmounting can be readily addressed with the mitigation\ndefense and -- and dealing with that that will take care\nof double damages so -- so if the whistleblower is just\nsitting around waiting for that, then the mitigation\ndefense would take care of that.\nAlso, I think the petitioner raised the idea\nthat this is some kind of -- the -- the retaliator can\nbring some kind of nebulous fraud allegation if it doesn't\n-- isn't really tied to a specific false claim. I think\nthat the courts are not interpreting it that way because\nthis is a False Claims Act retaliation claim, not just a\ngeneralized fraud claim. So in a typical case, there will\nbe a claim that -- that the whistleblower will -- will be\nable to point to and say I think that this claim is false.\nI have a good faith belief that it is false, and then it\n-- and that's what the trigger would be based on.\nI mean, in summary, if there's no further\nquestions, I'd like to just summarize.\nI think this Court should uphold the plain\nlanguage of the statute. While the limitations trigger is\nunusual, it is the one that Congress set forth in the\nstatute. It makes sense. It reflects the unique\nconsiderations of encouraging -- the goal of encouraging a\nwhistleblower to bring his qui tam claim with his\nretaliation claim.\n19 years of experience have shown that the plain\nlanguage works in the typical cases that arise, and that\nnone of the reasons given by the petitioners come close to\nproviding a justification for this Court to discard the\nplain language of the statute. None of the reasons --\nthis statute does not rise to the level of absurdity that\nwould justify this Court disregarding the plain language.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Hurt.\nMr. Driemeier, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nSection 3731(b) provides the statute of\nlimitations for, quote, a civil action under section 3730.\nThere is no question that Ms. Wilson's claim of\nretaliation is a claim under section 3730. Petitioner\nasks the Court to construe section 3731(b) to include an\nimplicit limitation to claims under subsections (a) or\n(b) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What he's saying is it should\nbe read to include only those causes of action under 3730\nthat the rest of (b) makes sense as applied to, just as in\n(c) the phrase, brought under section 3730, should be\ninterpreted to -- to include only those causes of action\nthat the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those\n-- those actions under 3730 that involve the United\nStates. I mean, that's -- that's a perfectly\nreasonable --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Section 3731(c) does\nnot require, in its application, the Court to construe a\ncivil action under section 3730 to mean anything other\nthan what its words import because it only relates to the\nUnited States' burden of proof.\nThe petitioner suggested that it implicitly was\nlimited to an action under 3730(a). Well, that's\ncertainly not true because if -- if an action is brought\nunder 3730(b) and the United States intervenes, section\n3731(c) establishes the standard of proof. If Congress\nwere to amend section 3730(h) to allow the United States\nto bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was\nretaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms,\nestablish the burden of proof that the United States would\nhave to meet. So there is no inconsistency there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- do you think\nCongress is more likely to amend 3731(b) to say clearly\nand non-sloppily what it means if we find for the\nGovernment here or if we find for the -- I mean, for --\nfor the side that the Government supports or if we find\nfor the other side?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\nthink that 3731(b) is capable of application exactly as\nwritten, and in fact, as we say in our brief, that that is\nthe statute of limitations which most serves the purposes\nof the statute unlike the alternative the petitioner --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about this as a\ngeneral -- as a general principle of construction? A\ncourt should not, unless there is no reasonable\nalternative, construe a statute of limitations provision\nin such fashion that the statute can expire before the\ncause of action arises?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a reasonable\nproposition?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There are any --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me reasonable to\nme.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Many States have\nadopted statutes of repose, and they apply to a cause of\naction that under State law accrues for purposes of\nstatute of limitations upon the discovery of the injury.\nBut a statute of repose can come in and instead tied to\nthe act, say, for instance, in which the date that a\nproduct was first sold into the market. And so the cause\nof action, for purposes of statute of limitations, will\nnot arise in many instances until after the statute of\nlimitations has run because of a statute of repose. So\nthat it's certainly not unheard of in the law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was the point that\nthe Seventh Circuit made clear in -- in its --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- statute of repose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about an action of\nejectment, an action of ejectment that arises only after\nthe adverse possession statute of limitations have run?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. There --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure it is right.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- there other examples\nof -- of cases in which the time in which a claim can be\nbrought may have expired before the cause of action\naccrues.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't run forward to\ncreate situations like that, do we?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My -- my point isn't that it\ncouldn't exist. I just said you should not interpret a\nstatute of limitations if it is reasonably possible to\navoid it in that fashion.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, in the Bay Area\nLaundry case and in the Reiter case, the Court has\nacknowledged that there is a general rule that statutes of\nlimitations start to run when the cause of action accrues.\nBut in each of those case -- cases, the Court was very\nclear that that was the rule that applied in the absence\nof contrary indication by Congress. And here we have a\nvery explicit contrary indication by Congress, that the\nstatute of limitations for any civil action under section\n3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section\n3729 was committed.\nIn other words, Congress has opted here to\nestablish a single uniform statute of limitations for all\nclaims that might arise under the False Claims Act. And\nas I said before, that serves the purposes of the False\nClaims Act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's\nalternative.\nAs we have pointed out, many State statutes of\nlimitations, assuming that one can determine which one\napplies of the many that might be offered, are much\nshorter than the statute provided for bringing the qui tam\naction. As a practical matter, then an employee might be\nforced to split their claims. If they split their claims,\nany number of adverse consequences follow.\nFirst, they could find themselves barred from\nbringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the\nUnited States by the public disclosure bar of the False\nClaims Act. The Eleventh Circuit has a rule that says\nthat the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata.\nSo in the Eleventh Circuit, apparently they could be\nbarred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action.\nThe disclosures in the course of the wrongful\ntermination of retaliation claim action would, of course,\nalert the defendant to the scope and extent of any\nGovernment investigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's already alerted to\nthe extent that he's taking retaliatory action as true.\nHe may not whole -- know the -- the whole extent of -- of\nwhat the employee knows, but he's already been tipped off.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as a practical\nmatter, oftentimes the employer fires the employee as soon\nas the employer has a sense that the employee is on to\nsomething. He doesn't have a full knowledge of what the\nemployee knows and certainly doesn't know that the\nemployee might have told the Government and that the\nGovernment is investigating. And that's the purpose of\nthe under seal requirement of the False Claims Act, to\nallow the Government to conduct a full investigation of\nthe claim, talk to other employees about what was going\non. Sometimes the employee really has identified fraud,\nbut may only have identified a portion of the larger\nscheme of fraud that's going on. And the Government gets\nto investigate that while the claim is under seal.\nBut in the course of discovery in any wrongful\ntermination suit or retaliation suit, all of that\ninformation would become available to the employer. And\nso the sealed provisions of the FCA would be defeated in\nlarge extent.\nThere's also the fact of just the litigation\nefficiencies of litigating the two claims together.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- will be the same.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you another textual\nquestion? You -- you want us to say that (b)(1) must\napply to all civil actions under section 3730. Must\n(b)(2) apply to all civil actions under 3730 as well?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- the most close\nreading of the text would be that any civil action under\n3730 can be brought within 3 years of when the official of\nthe United States -- now, we differ from the Ninth Circuit\non this. We believe that is only a Government official,\nin particular a Department of Justice official -- knows of\nthe facts relevant to bringing a cause of action that the\nUnited States could bring, i.e., the cause of action under\n3730(a). But we think that 3 years from that date in the\naction under 3730 could be brought, including the qui tam\naction or including a retaliation action.\nBut that reading is not essential to the\nposition that we advocate here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that -- that could exclude\neven a retaliation action by an individual who -- who\ndoesn't -- who doesn't know when the -- when the\nindividual -- the official of the United States found out\nabout those facts. That -- that doesn't seem to me very\nreasonable.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, of course --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That provision is very -- very\nreasonable as applied to qui tam actions. It doesn't seem\nto me to make any sense as applied to a retaliation\naction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, it --\nit does make sense applying it to a retaliation action\nbecause it could be, for instance, the employee who was\nthe individual who informed the Government official\ncharged with responsibility to act of the facts that would\nwarrant the United States in filing an action under\n3730(a).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might be, but maybe the\nUnited States found out before -- before that individual\ncame forward. Maybe there was an official in the United\nStates.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's\npossible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And so he's -- you know, he's\n-- he's out of -- out of time before he even knows about\nit.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, there may be\nevents that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Strange.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There may be instances\nwhere the employee would not know that they could take\nadvantage of that provision.\nBut in the Bay Area Laundry case, the Court\nconsidered and rejected a virtually identical argument.\nThat case -- the statute of limitations also was stated in\nthe alternative, and the second one was 3 years after the\ninformation necessary to the claim had arrived. And the\nparty who was opposed to the position the Court ultimately\nadopted said that the Court's interpretation of the first\nof the two alternatives would render the second\nsuperfluous. And the Court said, it may be superfluous to\nthis category of claims, but it's not superfluous to other\ncategories of claims, and so that does not prevent us from\nconstruing the first provision in the way that we are.\nSo likewise, even if the Court were to conclude\nthat 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a retaliation claim or\nunavailable to a qui tam claim, as some courts of appeals\nhave held, it would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is\nunavailable, just as holding that 3731(b)(2) is\nunavailable to a qui tam relator would not mean that\n3731(b)(1) is unavailable to a qui tam relator.\nA couple of Justices, Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it -- but it would mean\nthat just as 3731(b)(2) can be selectively applied to some\ncategories and not to others, so also, by parity of\nreasoning, (b)(1) can selectively be applied to some\ncategories of violation and not to others.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, again, we believe\nthat the best, most faithful reading of the text is that\n(b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730.\nThe -- Justice Souter asked a question about\nstatistics and the frequency with which the claims are\nlitigated together. In a review of court of appeals\ndecisions, there were 51 court of appeals decisions\nactually involving a 3730(h) claim. Of those, in 32 the\nqui tam -- a qui tam claim and a retaliation claim were\npaired. They were litigated together. In only 5 were\nboth a qui tam action and retaliation claim brought, but\nbrought in separate litigation. So 32 to 5 is the\nrelevant comparison there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the rest?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In -- in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- 14 claims an\nindividual brought a retaliation claim but never brought a\nqui tam suit. It may be that the Government had sought this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would county that as\nbeing brought separate. I think you should add that with\nthe other 5.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, in --\nin fact, if we -- if we look more closely at those 14\ncases, 5 of them were dismissed because the plaintiff was\nnot even involved in protected conduct under the statute.\nSo the closer you get to the core of what Congress had in\nmind, when it enacted the statute, of -- of pulling out\nemployees who have the information that only they have\nthat the Government needs in order to recover fraud, the\ncloser you get to that core, the more likely it is that\nthe claims that are going to be litigated together. And\nthat's the way the Court ought to apply the statute. It's\nthe way Congress wrote the statute, to serve those\npurposes.\nThe -- I -- I think that the alternative of\napplying State statutes of limitations raises -- North\nCarolina does not dispute that, for example, in Florida\nthe -- the analogous statute of limitations under Florida\nlaw -- it's the Florida State False Claims Act which has a\nretaliation provision -- would be 180 days. 180 days is\nfar too short to put together the complicated qui tam\ncomplaint that is called for under the False Claims Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, apparently\nFlorida didn't think so.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me, sir?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Apparently Florida\ndidn't think it was too short.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Florida may have\nmade an alternative policy decision in terms of wanting\nthe claims to be litigated together or apart. The\nCongress has established a single uniform statute of\nlimitations which allows the claims to be litigated\ntogether, and as I've said, that is in fact the practice\nthat when someone is going to bring a qui tam action, they\nalmost invariably -- there -- there are 5 exceptions --\nbring the cases together.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nDriemeier.\nMr. Browning, you have 8 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BROWNING: Thank you.\nThe Government argues that there will be\nproblems that will arise from splitting the qui tam action\nand the retaliatory discharge action. And one of the\nexamples that the Government use -- uses is the public\ndisclosure doctrine which is set out in section\n3730(e)(4)(A) of the False Claims Act. The public\ndisclosure doctrine, however, is a red herring here\nbecause the public disclosure doctrine is designed to keep\n-- to avoid parasitic lawsuits where information is in the\n-- the public domain, somebody taking that information,\nand then filing a -- a qui tam lawsuit.\nThe -- the public disclosure doctrine,\n3730(e)(4)(A), also provides that when someone is the\noriginal source of the information, even if the basis for\nthe lawsuit has been made public through a congressional\nhearing or elsewhere, that person can still bring an\naction if they're an original source. So it's a complete\nred herring here.\nThe other red herring that was put forth is a\nstatement that there's a rule in the Eleventh Circuit\nrelating to claims splitting. And forgive me, I cannot\nrecall the name of the case that the Government is\nreferring to, but it is a decision by James C. Hill. And\nthat specific case involved a situation where the qui tam\naction was brought, a settlement was reached, and then\nwell after the fact, the plaintiff said, oh, and I have\nthis retaliation claim. It makes perfect sense in that\nsituation to -- to apply principles of res judicata.\nWhat the Government is ignoring is there are no\nreported decisions anywhere where a retaliatory discharge\naction was brought and then res judicata was used to bar\nthe qui tam action filed at a later date. And there's a\nperfectly logical reason for that because they are\ndifferent causes of action, and they involve different\nparties. A retaliation claim is personal to the individual.\nA qui tam action is an action brought on behalf of the\nGovernment.\nOne final point that I'd like to make is the\nrespondent takes the position that the False Claims Act is\nunique. Well, it's not unique. It's not unique in that\nwhen you look at the Major Fraud Act, there is a\nretaliatory discharge provision that is virtually\nidentical to the False Claims Act, and in the Major Frauds\nAct -- with respect to the Major Fraud Act, Congress made\na -- a conscious decision not to include an express\nlimitations period.\nIt's not -- the False Claim Act is also not\nunique when you compare it to ERISA. ERISA --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just go back to what you\nsaid. In -- in the Major -- whatever it is -- is there\nany limitation at all, or just the limitation on the qui\ntam and as here, as you contend is so here?\nMR. BROWNING: The Major Fraud Act is a criminal\nprovision that provides a retaliatory discharge provision\nfor anyone who assists the Government in bringing the\ncriminal prosecution. There -- there -- in the Major\nFraud Act, there is a specific limitations period of 7\nyears in which the prosecution has to be brought by the\nUnited States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, that's -- that's a\ncriminal proceeding.\nMR. BROWNING: But -- but there is -- it -- but\nthe criminal statute provides for a civil remedy for a\nretaliatory discharge, and with respect to that\nretaliatory discharge provision in the Major Fraud Act,\nthere is no limitations provision.\nOne other point that I want to make is that the\nFalse Claims Act is not -- not unique when you compare it\nto ERISA. ERISA is a statute that has essentially a\nretaliatory discharge provision as well in section 510 of\nERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1140. And courts -- the Federal courts\nhave consistently held that there is no express\nlimitations period for section 510, so we have to look to\nthe limitations period under the most closely analogous\nState law cause of action.\nOn the other hand, ERISA has numerous\nprovisions, numerous other aspects of the statute, that do\nhave a limitations period. The limitations period for an\naction for breach of fiduciary duty is a 6-year period\nwith a 3-year tolling provision. So ERISA is a prime\nexample of a statute where Congress has made a decision\nthat when you have a retaliatory discharge provision, not\nto apply the statute of limitations period, that you look\nto State law, even though that Federal statute in other\naspects has other limitations provisions.\nIf there are no further questions, we would rely\nupon our briefs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nBrowning.\n"
