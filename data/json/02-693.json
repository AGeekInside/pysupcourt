        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in No. 02-693, John Lamie v. the United\nStates Trustee.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe parties to this case agree on one thing, and\nthat is that section 330(a) of the Bankruptcy Code\ncontains a mistake of some kind. Now, we disagree about\nwhat the mistake is, but there clearly is one.\nThe United States Trustee, for all of its\nrhetoric about the statute's plain text, actually says\nthat the statute contains two errors in two different\nplaces, but the list of compensable providers\ninadvertently includes a reference to the attorney and\nthat the statute's so-called payees' list inadvertently\nomits the necessary conjunction or.\nWe say there was a different mistake, that the\npayees' list inadvertently omits the reference to the\ndebtor's attorney, and our reading of the two is the\nsuperior one. It is the one that's most consistent with\nthe -- the structure of the statute as a whole, with the\npast bankruptcy practice, with the legislative history,\nand frankly, with common sense.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, who's covered by fees\navailable for a professional person employed under section\n327 or 1103?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be an attorney who's\nretained by a trustee, and according to the U.S. Trustee,\nit would also be an attorney retained by a debtor in\npossession in a chapter 11 case.\nThe --\nQUESTION: But not chapter 7.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. The reason --\nand let me take you through the statutory scheme, and\nperhaps I should take you -- everyone to the text, and\nit's in the blue brief at page 2a of the appendix.\nQUESTION: That's, obviously, of critical\nimportance. One piece of background information please.\nCould the chapter 11 court have authorized the debtor's\nattorney to do this work? I mean, how does that work? I\n-- and I -- I do agree that the chapter 7 -- the -- the\ndebtor's attorney really is often required to do some very\nimportant things to get the chapter 7 filed. But if the\n-- if it's an 11 first, as this one was, could the chapter\n11 court have authorized the work to be done?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: According to the U.S. Trustee,\nno. Let me, if I could, just step back and put this in\ncontext. This is a converted case, just like, for\nexample, the Hartford Underwriters case this Court had a\nfew terms ago. And so I take it the question might be,\nlook, if they were a debtor's attorney at one point -- and\nwe all agree that for the chapter 11 proceedings, they\nclearly were authorized to be paid under 330(a) -- could\nthat authorization have continued? And I think the answer\nis no because at some point there will be a fee\napplication and the fee application will be under 330(a),\nand what will happen is exactly what happened in this\ncase. The U.S. Trustee or the objector will say, look,\nfor the period that it was a chapter 7, there's a -- a gap\nin the statute.\nQUESTION: Even if you tell the court in the\nchapter 11 proceeding, we're going to go to 7 and we need\nthe debtor to do some work, the -- the court just has no\npower to authorize that work I guess is your position.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, no, no, no. Our position is\nto the contrary. The U.S. Trustee's position is that it\n-- they're without power. I think it's an important\npoint.\nWe view the structure of the statute to operate\njust as it has for -- the Bankruptcy Code has for 100\nyears, and that is, that the bankruptcy court is a\ngatekeeper. It has to decide, in what are now the literal\nterms of the statute, whether the services of the debtor's\nattorney are both necessary and beneficial to the estate.\nThe position of the U.S. Trustee is that even\nwhen the services are both necessary and beneficial to the\nestate -- that is to say, even when they produce more\nmoney for the creditors, which is the whole point, after\nall -- you still can't perform the services and be\ncompensable --\nQUESTION: Well, why can't the -- I mean, their\nargument is the trustee can do it. The trustee's object\nis the maximize the -- the value for the estate and so on,\nand -- and therefore there's no built-in conflict there.\nWhy isn't that a way out of this drafting mess?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because there are things that\nthe Bankruptcy Code assigns as responsibility to the\ndebtor, not the trustee. And second, the provision that\n-- and so let me -- let me separate --\nQUESTION: No, but is there any conflict in the\ntrustee saying, look, you can do these things for the\ndebtor and I'll pay you?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Let me take you to the\nrelevant statutory provision. This one is in the gray\nbrief in the appendix. That's 327(e). There is a passing\nsuggestion in the Government's brief -- and, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that is at 1a of the gray brief. It's at the\nbottom. There is a suggestion by the U.S. Trustee that if\nthe debtor's attorney really needs to do something, the\ntrustee's lawyer will hire the debtor's lawyer, and so it\nall will work out in the end, and I take it that's a point\nyou're picking up.\nThe statute is much more limited than that. It\nsays the trustee, with the court's approval, may employ\nfor a specified special purpose, other than to represent\nthe trustee, and it goes on to say, an attorney that has\nrepresented the debtor.\nThe way this works -- and we have tried very\nhard to find out how often this happens. Mr. Lamie's\nfirm, for example, has been doing bankruptcy for 23 years\nand has represented the debtor in more than 4,000 cases.\nIn that entire time, the trustee has hired the debtor's\ncounsel two times.\nQUESTION: Maybe -- not to -- not to be cute\nabout it, but maybe those are the only times he should\nhave.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we know that that's not\nthe case, Justice Souter, because the Bankruptcy Code\ndoes, as Justice Kennedy has suggested, give important\nresponsibilities to the debtor qua debtor, not that are\ndistinct from the duties of the trustee. And let me give\nyou an example of that. And so those are jobs that can't\nbe handled by the trustee. They're the responsibility of\nthe debtor.\nQUESTION: But is there any conflict -- any\nconflict of -- of -- you know, ethical or quasi-ethical\nconflict if the -- if the trustee says, look, these\nresponsibility -- you've got to shoulder these\nresponsibilities. It's very difficult for somebody who's\nnot a lawyer to do it. Okay, I -- I will employ a lawyer\nto help you. Is there -- is there any conflict between\nthe trustee and the lawyer there?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, actually there is. The --\nthe problem is that the debtor and the trustee sometimes\nhave divergent interests. That's why the legislative\nhistory to 327(e) says we want to limit the times that the\ntrustee will hire the debtor's lawyer. But --\nQUESTION: Would you give me -- just give me an\nexample, a garden variety example --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: An exemption fight.\nQUESTION: -- of a conflict situation?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: An exemption fight.\nQUESTION: Yes, okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: When you're trying to -- to\ndecide whether or not the debtor gets to claim an\nexemption.\nAnd so let me give you a couple more examples\njust about how this operates.\nQUESTION: Before you do, Mr. Goldstein, is it\ntrue that in most chapter 7's, this is an academic\nquestion because there's not any money to pay even the --\nany -- the administrative creditors?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, but the fact that in\nrelative terms, in terms of the percentage of chapter 7's,\nit's not that big a deal does not mean in absolute terms\nit's not. We know, for example, that there are at least\n40,000 asset cases. In particular, we have complicated\nbusiness cases. Hartford Underwriters, which you all had\nas a case, is an example.\nQUESTION: These end up as chapter 7 cases?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. There\nare a lot of converted business cases. Generally when we\nbelieve there's going to be an asset, they are pursued as\na 11's, but lots of times the ability to keep up with the\ncreditors breaks down and they can get converted to 7's.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, you know, Congress had\nthis problem brought to its attention a number of times\nand -- and has chosen not to enact something, putting that\nlanguage back in. That I find somewhat persuasive.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In all candor, Justice O'Connor,\nI think that's a point in their favor. It's just not one\nthat's going to overcome the other indications of\nCongress' intent. So let me speak to that and then what\nthe other --\nQUESTION: Before you get to the intent of\nCongress, I'm rather stuck with the language. I mean,\nwhat we'd have to do, in order to come out your way, is to\nread the words, the court may award to a trustee, an\nexaminer, a professional person employed under 327 or\n1103, and the lawyer. Is there one case that you've found\n-- I'm sure you've looked because you're very thorough --\nin the history of the world --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- where -- I couldn't find any, but\nI don't know all the cases in the history of the world --\nwhere -- where, in fact, a court, when faced with a\ndefinite list like this and unable to say, and other such\npersons or -- fool with the language. Maybe you'll think\nof some way of doing it -- where a court is simply stuck\nin words of insignificance that weren't there because they\nthought the legislature had made a mistake. Can you give\nme a list of the most relevant such cases, if there are\nsuch?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, and then I will come back\nto Justice O'Connor.\nThe point here is that there are a number of\ncases -- and we cite these in our brief -- that the\nexpressio unius canon, on which you're -- to which you're\nadverting --\nQUESTION: No. I'm not adverting to any canon.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well --\nQUESTION: I am adverting to the fact that the\nwords aren't there.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, let me explain\nto why I think you are, and then you can tell me why I'm\nmisguided, I'm sure.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No. All I want is the name of a case\nwhere a court --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: United States v. Wilson.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: United States v. Wilson, and\nthen I'll come back to why I think their argument is an\nexpressio unius one, and then I'll explain to you U.S. v.\nWilson. It's on page 10 of the yellow brief that we\ndiscuss it.\nThe statute says that the court may award to a\ntrustee, an examiner, or professional person employed\nunder section 327. I'm back on 2a of the blue brief. It\nhas a list. It doesn't say only, and there are many\ncases. There are legions of cases in which a list is not\nregarded as exclusive when -- I think there's a\npresumption of exclusivity, but when the contrary\nindications in the text or the history of the drafting or\nsomething else tells you that Congress didn't intend the\nlist to be exclusive, and this is such a case.\nThe reason I cite U.S. v. Wilson to you is\nthat's a case in which the statute referred specifically\nto the Attorney General. The Attorney General, before the\nstatute was revised, was supposed to compute the amount of\ntime that is given as credit from pretrial detention.\nCongress, as it did with section 330, rewrote the statute\nentirely, and this Court said, look, we admit that the\nreference to the Attorney General is gone, but it looks\nlike it just got lost in the shuffle if we look at the\nother indications of Congress' intent.\nNow, let me just make one other important --\nQUESTION: Well, you think this just got lost in\nthe shuffle?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's why I'm asking you a question\nthat I hope --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- you'll be allowed to answer --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- about what about Congress'\nopportunity to correct it --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- which they didn't --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, this Court has never\nreally taken that view of subsequent legislative history,\nJustice O'Connor, but let me turn to the events.\nIn 1997, there were two bills that were proposed\nin the Congress that were a part of general correction\nlegislation that had a variety of different provisions,\nincluding one fix for this one. I think the important\npoint is that at that time, the only case in the circuits\ninterpreting the statute as it then stood went our way.\nIt was the 1996 decision of the Second Circuit in Ames.\nAnd so I don't think you can infer from the fact that\nCongress didn't change the statute to confirm the rule in\nthe circuits means that they intended to reject it.\nQUESTION: Isn't there a current -- isn't there\na current correction -- bankruptcy technical correction\nbill pending, and isn't this absent from it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is, but Justice Ginsburg --\nso now we have not just the failure to enact legislation\nexists, but the U.S. Trustee is relying on the failure to\nenact legislation that doesn't even exist.\nThe point, I think, is that, look, if you read\nthe statute, if you look at it right now, it's simply\nambiguous. There's a reference to the attorney that's in\nthere, and a reference to the attorney that's missing.\nThis is not a case -- and this is absolutely\ncritical -- in which there was a reference to the\nattorney, there was only one, and it disappeared, and\nwe're asking you to read it back in. Our position is that\nthe statute, as written, stands essentially in equipoise.\nThe two references to the attorney in the 1978 version of\nthe statute were inextricably intertwined, and so if you\nlook at the text right now, the fact that Congress hasn't\nchanged it doesn't tell you anything about whether or not\nthey intend it to be in there or not to be in there\nbecause the split is almost even. There's one --\nQUESTION: But now it has been called to their\nattention and it isn't in the bill making other technical\ncorrections.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, I agree, and I\n-- I'm obviously not making this point well enough. What\nI'm saying is that the inference that would be normally\ndrawn from the failure to fix a statutory error doesn't\ncut in either direction here because, as I began in the\nintroduction, both sides believes there -- believes that\nthere's an error. But we both think there's a mistake in\nthe statute. The fact that Congress hasn't corrected the\nmistake doesn't tell us anything about what the mistake\nwas.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Goldstein, you're\noverlooking one -- one other argument I think. Before\nthis statute was enacted, the Association of Bankruptcy --\nwhatever the name of it is -- called their attention to\nthis drafting error and said we think it's a drafting\nerror.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- yes.\nQUESTION: And nothing was done.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, let me put that\nseries of events in slightly more context, and that is\nthat in the House, when the bill was not pending there,\nthere was a hearing, and there is one line in a 718-page\nrecord of just written materials submitted that says there\nis an inadvertent omission.\nThe -- the one canon of construction that runs\nthrough this Court's bankruptcy cases --\nQUESTION: Let me just add one thought. They\nsaid this appears to have been some minor drafting errors,\nincluding the apparently inadvertent removal of debtors'\nattorneys from the list of professionals whose\ncompensation awards are covered by 330(a). NACBA does not\noppose this provision since it contains language and so\nforth and so on. So they -- it's -- one can read that as\nsaying even with the error, we don't -- we don't oppose\nthe provision.\nQUESTION: Right. We actually -- that\nreference, we do not oppose this provision, we believe, in\nthe context of those remarks, to be referring to the\naddition of section (a)(4)(B). Congress in 1994 added a\nprovision that's much debated in the briefs about chapter\n12 and 13 bankruptcies. Remember, this is the National\nAssociation of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, and what\nthey were not objecting to is the addition of a provision\nthat relates to consumer bankruptcies.\nBut let's be perfectly clear. The -- the\nUnited States has scoured the legislative record of this\nchange and has found one sentence in one House hearing,\nand it says that it was a mistake. The principle in\nbankruptcy is if there's a statutory change and it's not\nclear on the text or at least in the legislative history,\nit's presumed not to change --\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't it possible also\nto read this as saying, yes, you made a mistake, but even\nso, it's still a good bill and we think even with the\nmistake, we're in favor of it, and then -- and then\nCongress looks at it and says, yes, we did make a mistake,\nbut -- but the -- our -- we'll stick to that decision\nbecause the United States' position now is that that's a\nwise -- the provision is a wise one?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is important to note, of\ncourse, that when the Department of Justice and the U.S.\nTrustee commented on the bill at the time, they did not\nsay that this would be the result of the statute or that\nthey proposed it.\nBut I don't -- Justice Stevens, I don't think\nthat when someone says there's a mistaken omission -- and\nremember, it's of course at the time when the U.S. Trustee\nsays language is mistakenly included at the same time.\nWhen someone says there's a mistake, that's a very\ndifferent thing from Congress -- let's engage in all of\nthe false assumptions that people actually read this thing\nin the Senate and people paid attention -- that Congress\nactually acknowledged, yes, we're changing bankruptcy\npolicy. The standards for changing bankruptcy policy,\nparticularly a policy as settled as this one, are much\nhigher --\nQUESTION: Well, are the standards for changing\nbankruptcy policy in Congress different from the standards\nof changing other kinds of policy?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nindications in this Court's precedents -- the answer to\nthat question is yes.\nQUESTION: And what -- what precedents are\nthose?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Those would be principally the\nline of cases that begin with Midatlantic. We cite\nseveral of them, Hartford Underwriters, Ron Pair, that\nsort of thing. The Court has recognized, going back to\nwell before the '78 code and subsequent to the '78 --\nQUESTION: Well, but some of the -- the\nMidatlantic, for example, was shortly after the Bankruptcy\nCode was adopted succeeding the 1898 act, and there, there\nwas probably a good reason for saying when you have that\nsort of a comprehensive revision, the presumption is that\nif something -- it's not clear where something was\nchanged, we meant to retain the old. But this wasn't that\nsort of thing.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but I think that the relevant answer would be\nthat Cohen v. de la Cruz, which deals with a much more\nminor revision of the Bankruptcy Code than even this one,\nthe 1984 revision applies the same principle and that is\nthis Court has recognized that the provisions of the\nBankruptcy Code are incredibly interrelated. There's a\nlongstanding practice that has built up over time, and\nthat Congress doesn't lightly change it.\nAnd let me talk about why this would have to be\nthe --\nQUESTION: At some point, will you go back to my\nfirst question?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: I just -- you have just a few --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, why -- because I looked at\nUnited States v. Wilson. It doesn't seem like this at\nall. The statute there said a defendant shall be given\ncredit towards his sentence for time previously spent in\nprison. It's in the passive voice. It doesn't say\nwhether it shall be given credit by the AG or also by a\ndistrict court. Well, obviously, you could read the\nlanguage either way.\nWhat I'm having problems here with is that I\ndon't see any way to read this language so that it comes\nout with your favor without putting in three words that\naren't there. And I haven't heard from Justinian -- the\ntime of Justinian, a court ever having done that, and if\nthere is a court that did it, it wasn't Wilson.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. I think I'm responding\nto --\nQUESTION: You can have --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I think -- I think we have\na new thread. Perhaps the best answer to your point is\nGreen v. the Bach Laundry, which is not a case that's\ndiscussed in the -- in the briefs, but I will explain how\nthis arises. And that is, Federal Rule of Evidence 609\nsaid, look, if there's going to be -- if you're going to\nimpeach a defendant, you get to use prior convictions, and\nthe Court looked at it and said, really, it says\ndefendants, and we acknowledge it means all -- you know,\nthe plain language of that is all defendants, and the\nCourt inserted the word criminal and said from the --\nQUESTION: Inserted the word what?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Inserted the word criminal. It\nsaid that rule 609 would only apply to criminal\ndefendants.\nQUESTION: But that's -- you're not missing --\nyou're missing my point. There are millions of ways --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- to read language in a statute --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- so that it has a limited scope or\na scope over here or only applies there. That's so common\nevery day of the week, and very often I look at the policy\nand I see if the statute is possibly construed in that way\nthrough that kind of limitation. What I've never seen is\na statute which you just can't word by -- read by limiting\nthe scope or saying other things like this, et cetera.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nQUESTION: I've never seen a court just take\nthree words out of the blue and insert them in that way in\na statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Justice Breyer, I\nthink that I probably am not going to have a case that\nsatisfies you, but I think that I can dispute successfully\nthe premise, and that is, I do believe that your premise\nis that expressio unius applies. I promised I would come\nback to that point. And the text says, the court may\naward to a trustee, an examiner, or professional person.\nIt doesn't say to only those people. What I'm telling you\nis that the other -- the remaining indications of\nCongress' intent indicate that Congress did not intend to\nlimit the payment to go to those people.\nAnd second, this is not a case in which only we\nhave a textual problem. Remember that the U.S. Trustee,\njust as you say we have to read in a -- a word, they have\nto read out a word.\nQUESTION: Well, they don't have to read it out.\nThey just say the word is superfluous. There's -- there's\nno explanation for why it's there. But, you know, there\nare a lot of statutes that have superfluous words, and\nthat does a lot less violence certainly to the statute to\nleave in a word that doesn't have to be there than -- than\nto insert a phrase, which is what you're asking us to do.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think you and Justice Breyer\nmay be making a similar point here, and that is, look, if\nwe had the text and all we had was the text, it would do\nless violence you say, and I think I can concede it would\ndo less violence to read in the -- the word rather than to\nrender the other one superfluous or read it out. But I\ndon't think that's the question before you because you\ndon't just have the text. If you -- this was all that\nthere was, you could apply a canon like that one. It\nwould do less harm, you know, the principle of sort of do\nno harm.\nBut what I'm telling you is that there is an\nambiguity in the statute, that the provisions of the\npayees' and the providers' lists are inextricably\nintertwined, that the trustee can be paid for the services\nof the trustee, the examiner for services of the examiner,\nthe professional person for services of the professional\nperson. And then there's this gap for services of the\nattorney. There's an ambiguity. And so just like any\nother case in which you have to resolve a statutory\nambiguity, you look to other things.\nQUESTION: Why don't you just say the first\ncorrection, which is -- or the first, in -- in your view,\nslip is the elimination of four words? That's really what\nthey wanted to do because that's the lead provision, and\nthen in the subsidiary provision, there's only one word\nthat they left in. So if you -- just looking at the\nstatute, I assume you would say the lead provision is the\nmain one and the other, the subsidiary provision, four\nwords in one case, one word in the other.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that we have to\nget down to the number of words or syllables or anything\nlike that. I think perhaps a more fair -- if we're --\nagain, in the world of tie-breakers looking only at the\ntext, it's that the U.S. Trustee's position requires you\nto conclude that there are mistakes in two different\nplaces, in both the payees' list, the missing conjunction\nor, and the providers' list, the inadvertent --\nQUESTION: But there were umpteen illustrations\nof missing or's. I mean, we really can't put much weight\non that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nthink there's any greater canon that says we find errors\npresumptively in second provisions rather than first ones.\nThere are much greater indications of Congress' intent\nthan that. We have a lot more to work with.\nI do think I need to make two points. The first\nis Justice O'Connor has, to some extent, focused on what\nhappened here, you know, what did Congress know. I think\nit's important to recognize, as I started to say, this\nwould be a change without any consideration by Congress at\nall. This statute started --\nQUESTION: But how can you say that if this\nmaterial I called to your attention was called to the\nattention at least of the staff of the committee? Surely\nthe staff would have recognized that because I presume\nthey read it, and presumably they would have discussed it\nwith the Congressmen and said, do you think we ought to\nmake a change, and somebody said no.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right, Justice Stevens, let me\ndistinguish two different periods of time. I was about to\ntalk about -- and we'll come back to when this -- the\nwords got dropped out. You're focusing later, and so let\nme answer your question with -- try and answer it in a\nsomewhat different way, and that is, the only thing that\nwas pointed out to them was that there was a mistake. And\nif you look at the text, you don't know what Congress'\nintent was. Was it to leave the language in or to delete\nit? Because there are two parallel, intertwined\nreferences to the attorney.\nI had said that I would come back to the '84 --\nthe '94 change. This is what the Fourth Circuit thought\nwas so important. That is, it mistakenly thought --\nQUESTION: May I just get one other thought out?\nWhat is the parallel provision that you say remains in?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the reference in -- I'm\non 2a of the blue brief, 11 U.S.C. 330(a), subsection\n(1)(A), what we've called the providers' list. And this\nproviders' list parallels the one in section 331.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Reasonable compensation for\nactual, necessary services rendered by the trustee,\nexaminer, professional person, or attorney. So what\nhappened is that --\nQUESTION: Why -- why couldn't that refer to an\nattorney appointed by the trustee?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, it -- as has been\nsuggested, literally it could. You could render it\nsurplusage or you could say it's the attorney of the\ntrustee. But a few things about that.\nWe know it really is surplusage because there's\nalready a reference to the attorney of the trustee.\nThat's the professional person. This was one of the first\nquestions --\nQUESTION: No, but it -- not -- the -- the --\nthere's another possibility: any attorney employed by the\ntrustee. And that's not surplusage. You have given me a\nreason why there may be a conflict involved if the trustee\ndoes employ an attorney for the debtor, but whatever it\nis, it's not surplusage.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is, Justice Souter. The\nreference in this line to a professional person is the\nprofessional person employed under section 327. That's\nthe trustee's attorney. The -- and the United States\ndoesn't dispute this. It acknowledges that it is\nsurplusage.\nQUESTION: No, but if the trustee appoints an\nattorney not for himself, but for the debtor --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Ah.\nQUESTION: -- then it's not surplusage.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize. The trustee is not\nempowered to -- I -- I think I may have confused you back\nat the beginning of this. The trustee is not empowered to\nhire a person to represent the debtor.\nQUESTION: I -- let me -- let's assume I\nmisspoke. The trustee may very well be empowered to pay\nthe person employed by the debtor.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nQUESTION: That's a way of reading these two\nsections together.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. If so, we win.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And there will be an explanation\nto follow.\nQUESTION: I did not expect that answer.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We all should assume that all --\nthe answer to all the questions, if so, we win, because\nwhat would happen is that, remember, literally the\ndebtor's attorney may be -- provides compensable services,\nand then the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has focused on\nand then you have is that we have the question of, okay,\nwho -- who gets the money. Does it go to the trustee, the\nexaminer, or the professional person? So if the trustee\ngets paid for the services of the debtor's attorney --\nremember, this is a case in which Mr. Lamie acted at the\nrequest of the trustee -- then the trustee has to turn the\nmoney over. The money actually belongs to Mr. Lamie. He\nprovided the services. That's how it would all work\ntogether. And that is, in a case like this one, where the\ndebtor's attorney acts at the request of the trustee --\nthis case is your hypothetical. The money goes to the\ntrustee who then obviously has to turn it over the\nattorney. That's who would have the equitable interest in\nit.\nIf I could retain the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Goldstein.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Bankruptcy Code contains no authority to use\nestate funds that are held for the benefit of creditors to\ncompensate the chapter 7 debtor's attorney. Before 1994,\nthe code authorized estate funds to be used to compensate\nall debtors' attorneys, but the 1994 amendments\nunambiguously deleted the chapter 7 debtors' attorneys\nfrom the class of persons eligible to receive compensation\nunder the statute.\nQUESTION: It eliminated them unambiguously I\nguess from the class of persons entitled to be paid\ndirectly, but did it eliminate them from the class of\npersons who might ultimately be compensated, i.e., the\nclass in -- in -- what is it? Subsection (a).\nMS. BLATT: Yes. Only the -- if -- an attorney,\nincluding the debtor's attorney, can still be compensated,\nbut he has to be appointed by the court under section 327\nand then he stands as a professional person that's\nretained under 327, but that has to be retained under 327.\nQUESTION: So -- so the -- so the reference is\nsurplusage in (a).\nMS. BLATT: It's superfluous in this sense. Our\nreading of the statute is the same regardless because the\nattorney is nothing more than a subset of professional\npersons.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: But Congress may -- it may have\nfailed to make a conforming change, but it's also possible\nthat Congress specifically left the word in because\nCongress often uses overlapping terms to accomplish its\nobjectives. And it was doing no harm there, and it would\nat least remove any doubt that even the debtor's attorney\ncould be paid as long as he qualified as a professional\nperson that was retained under 327.\nQUESTION: But the word attorney in 330 would\nthen have a different meaning after the amendment than it\nhad before because before the amendment, it clearly\nreferred to the debtor's attorney, did it not?\nMS. BLATT: That's correct, but there's no\nquestion that the -- the code, as it now stands, has --\nomits the debtor's attorney from one of the authorized\npeople. And what petitioner is basically seeking, Justice\nStevens, is a substantive enlargement of the code because\nhe wants to do something, that is, receive a --\nQUESTION: Well, he's arguing the word attorney\nmeans the same thing it always meant. In other words, in\n330.\nMS. BLATT: That's fine. The debtor's --\nQUESTION: And you're saying it means something\ndifferent.\nMS. BLATT: It could still mean the debtor's\nattorney, but there's no question in this case petitioner\nwas not authorized to be retained by the trustee under\nsection 327. The debtor's attorney is unambiguously not\none of the list of people in 330(a) who is authorized to\nreceive compensation, just like a creditor's attorney is\nnot on that list or a debtor's spouse is not on that list.\nQUESTION: Why does it make any sense,\nconsidering that the code does give obligations, duties\nthat must be done by the chapter 7 debtor? And some of\nthem are pretty complex.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think it reflects the\nfundamental distinction between chapter 7 and all other\ncodes. That's chapters 11, 12, and 13. In a chapter 7\ncase, the bulk of the work is done pre-petition. It's\nadvising the debtor about which chapter to file, filling\nout the schedules, telling the debtor what property is\nexempt, and so forth. And in chapters 11, 12, and 13, the\nwhole game is in doing a plan which is all post-petition,\nand the trustee and the debtor, the -- excuse me -- the\ndebtor and the creditors work together to figure out a\nplan.\nQUESTION: But -- but why doesn't that help the\npetitioner? As Justice Ginsburg is indicating, before the\npetition is filed, a chapter 7 debtor has to comply with\nsome rather complex forms, plus be advised of -- of his\nduties and liabilities. Don't take assets out the back\ndoor and so forth. So there's a chronological problem\nhere that -- the -- the trustee can't appoint the attorney\nuntil the proceeding is filed, but the attorney is really\nrequired to do some advance work.\nMS. BLATT: Justice Kennedy, there's no question\nthat both before and after the 1994 amendments, chapter 7\ndebtors retained counsel, but they do so in the\noverwhelming majority of cases with a pre-petition flat\nfee, usually $750-$850. They pay their lawyer pre-\npetition.\nQUESTION: And that can be paid.\nMS. BLATT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: That is paid the lawyer --\nQUESTION: Is it established that's not\navoidable preference?\nMS. BLATT: Absolutely. It's in the ordinary\ncourse of --\nQUESTION: For current services?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. This is done day in and day\nout. The United States Trustees have supervised the\nliquidation of a million cases each year.\nQUESTION: It would be avoidable preference if\nit's too high, wouldn't it?\nMS. BLATT: If it's too high, but I'm talking\nabout the standard, routine fee of under $1,000 if\nsomebody walks in because they've been overwhelmed by\ncredit card debts or gambling debts or had a divorce, they\nneed representation on how to fill out the schedules, what\ntypes of property are exempt, and they retain counsel, the\ncounsel takes that money, gets the standard flat fee, that\n-- and all the services are earned pre-petition with one\nexception.\nQUESTION: What if the -- what if the check\nbounced and there's now been a conversion to 7 and the --\nand the lawyer says, I ought to be paid for my 11 work?\nOn your theory, does he get paid?\nMS. BLATT: Not out of estate funds. He should\nprobably clear -- have the check cleared before he\nperforms the services.\nQUESTION: He clears the check.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: Bankruptcy counsel do this --\nQUESTION: So you're saying at this point,\nregardless of chapter 11 work, chapter 7 work, no payment\nout of the -- the estate funds.\nMS. BLATT: Not out of estate funds, but it's --\nit's critical to understand that in chapter 7, unlike all\nother chapters, the -- the estate is frozen at the time of\npetition. 98 percent of all chapter 7 debtors are\nindividuals. If they have a job or any post-petition\nincome or there are exempt assets, they can use that money\nto pay the -- pay counsel to assist them in completing\nbankruptcy.\nAnd I want to -- do want to address one very --\none class of very important services that came up that I\nthink, Justice Souter, you raised, and that is when the\ndebtor and the trustee or creditors are fighting over\nobjections to exemption. They could also be fighting over\nobjections to discharge. These are serious matters where\noften the debtor is accused of misconduct and the debtor\nwill need a lawyer. There's no question that even before\nthe 1994 amendments, the overwhelming majority of courts\nwould have held that those are services that benefit the\npersonal -- that go to the personal benefit of the debtor\nand not the estate. And they would not have been\ncompensable even before 1994, and if this -- if this Court\nis going to take the extraordinary step of writing it back\nin, it will not affect those cases. And so --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you about --\nMS. BLATT: Sure.\nQUESTION: -- a provision of the statute you\ndidn't include in your brief, or at least in the appendix.\nSection 329 --\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- specifically authorizes the\ndebtor's attorney to receive a retainer, as I understand\nit.\nMS. BLATT: That's for the code as it -- what --\nthis is a -- a pro-creditor provision that recognizes that\ndebtors will often go to counsel before they file\nbankruptcy, and anyone, whether or not you seek\ncompensation under the statute, any lawyer for any debtor\nwho ultimately files for bankruptcy has to disclose their\nfee arrangement, and the court can order the cancellation\nof it or return of the fee if it's excessive or\nunreasonable.\nQUESTION: But -- but if the court does not\norder a cancellation of it, it seems to me that provision\ncontemplates a payment to the debtor's attorney for his\nservices to the debtor.\nMS. BLATT: Pre-petition. This is for a -- any\ntype of fee arrangement that's pre-petition whether or not\nyou apply for compensation. There are many cases where\nthe chapter -- excuse me -- the debtor's counsel will, in\nfact, be paid under 12, under 13, under 11, and those --\nQUESTION: This refers to 7. I think 329\napplies to chapter 7 cases.\nMS. BLATT: Right. Any -- any debtor. Even if\nthere was an express prohibition for money for the estate\nto be paid, section 329 would still independently operate\nto require the counsel to disclose his fee agreement. It\napplies whether or not compensation is ever sought under\n330.\nQUESTION: Well, in section (b), it authorizes\nthe court to cancel it -- cancel the agreement if it's\nunreasonable compensation. So it seems to me it applies\nthat if the compensation was reasonable, they could\napprove it.\nMS. BLATT: Right, but that's -- that's pre-\npetition.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand, but the money has\nto be paid pre-petition. Here, of course, it was, but he\nkept it in escrow instead of putting it in his pocket.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. So it remained the\nfunds of the estate and it had to be paid under 330 and it\nwas -- it was not a question of 329.\nBut the other -- other point I want to get back\non why this serves reasonable policy objectives, not only\ndoes the individual debtor have the ability to pay counsel\nwith either his exempt assets, his post-petition income,\nor a pre-petition flat fee, but chapter 7, unlike all\nother cases, it is the trustee and not the debtor who\nmanages, represents, and liquidates the estate. And the\ncode gives the trustee the explicit authority under\nsection 327 of the code to retain counsel, including the\ndebtor's counsel, to take actions that further the benefit\n-- the best interests of the estate.\nQUESTION: But not that would assist the debtor\nin the exemption example.\nMS. BLATT: No. That's exactly right. If the\n-- if for some reason the trustee could not read an\naccounting form and the debtor's counsel couldn't answer\nit, the trustee can go retain a professional person like\nan accountant, and if the trustee needs a lawyer to take\nactions to further the best interests of the estate, it is\ntrue that that lawyer represent the -- represents the\nestate, but there's no reason he can't meet with the\ndebtor and help him explain something.\nBut 96 percent of all chapter 7 cases, there are\nno assets in the estate to begin with. These are the kind\nof cases I was talking about, where they are covered by a\nroutine flat fee that covers --\nQUESTION: I really don't understand that\nargument because this case just involves the other 4\npercent, and there are a lot of cases in the 4 percent,\naren't there? Several thousand.\nMS. BLATT: That's true, and in those cases --\nQUESTION: So what difference does it make that\n96 percent -- it doesn't make any difference. I don't\nunderstand that argument.\nMS. BLATT: I think it goes to the idea that\ngiven that there's a plain absence of any statutory\nauthority to do this, the question is, is this some sort\nof absurd result that Congress could not have plausibly\nintended? And in the 4 percent of categories where there\nare assets, Justice Stevens, the trustee represents the\nestate. He manages it and he liquidates it. And if\nthere's money to be paid to -- for counsel and the\ncounsel's services are needed, the trustee can use that\nmoney and retain counsel. At the same time, the chapter 7\ndebtor --\nQUESTION: Has retained counsel to do work to\nbenefit the estate, not retained counsel to represent the\ndebtor.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. And at the same time,\nthere is --\nQUESTION: Which he could have done before 1996.\nMS. BLATT: Right. And there's nothing in the\n1994 amendments that prevents the debtor from taking his\npost-petition salary, his exempt assets --\nQUESTION: Not if he's a company, as in this\ncase.\nMS. BLATT: Right. In a -- in a company, Your\nHonor, it's important, Justice Ginsburg, to keep in mind\neverything like objections to discharge, exempt assets --\nnone of that applies to corporations. Corporations,\nunlike individuals, do not survive bankruptcy, and so they\ndon't have issues like exempt assets and objections to\ndischarge. You have a defunct corporation that's\nliquidating.\nAnd we think this case is a perfect illustration\nof what happens when you have a case with marginal assets\nin chapter 7, and that's usually where the -- the\nbusinesses with no assets or marginal assets go, is\nchapter 7. The trustee had ample authority to retain\npetitioner's counsel, and in fact, what happened\nultimately in this case is what -- the bulk of what\npetitioner's counsel was doing was representing the estate\nin a fight with a creditor and --\nQUESTION: Well, he didn't have ample authority\nto do it before the chapter 7 was filed, did he?\nMS. BLATT: No. When the case is in chapter 11,\nthe debtor is the debtor in possession with all the powers\nand duties of the trustee, and it's solely the debtor.\nThere is no trustee. The debtor has to take actions to\nrepresent the estate. All that changes when it converts\nto a 7. Then it's the trustee. The keys have to be\nturned over to the trustee and the trustee runs the show.\nQUESTION: But -- but I thought you indicated\nthat the trustee had ample authority to hire the debtor's\nattorney, and I -- in the chapter 7 proceeding, and I\nsaid, true, but does he have the authority to hire the\ndebtor's attorney before the chapter 7 is filed? That's\nwhat we're talking about. He doesn't have that authority.\nMS. BLATT: This -- I mean, I'll try to take you\nchronologically. The case started out an 11, and then the\npetitioner was -- was retained under section 327, had a\nspecific order, and therefore was entitled to be paid from\nthe estate. Once the case --\nQUESTION: For work done from that time forward.\nMS. BLATT: Work done just while it was an 11.\nOnce it's in a 7, all those duties ceased. There was\nnothing for the corporation to do except liquidate and\ncooperate with the trustee, who had the statutory\nresponsibility to represent and manage and liquidate the\nestate.\nQUESTION: Well, there's no trustee until\nchapter 7, is there?\nMS. BLATT: That's right. Right. Once -- once\nit converts to chapter 7, then it's the trustee's job to\ntake over. And the trustee eventually did take over the\nadversary proceeding and bring the -- continue the case\nagainst the creditor.\nQUESTION: And he can hire the -- and he can\nhire the debtor's attorney to do work in the chapter 7,\nbut that doesn't compensate for what -- the work that was\ndone before chapter 7.\nMS. BLATT: That's right.\nQUESTION: The work that was done before chapter\n7 was compensated in this case.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, it was paid. There was $2,000\nof fees in this case and $3 in expenses, and $1,000 has\nbeen paid for all the work in 11. And what will happen,\nif the Court affirms the Fourth Circuit, is when cases\nconvert, the debtor's counsel will cease performing work\nunless the trustee actually gets a court order approving\ntheir retention. The trustee can hire its own lawyer to\nassist with its -- with -- with his or her duties and can\nhire the debtor's counsel for a special purpose. And that\nwould have been like this case where there's an adversary\nproceeding either by or against the debtor.\nUnited States Trustees have supervised and\noverseen the liquidation of millions of chapter 7 cases in\nthe 9 years since the 1994 amendments, and it has been\ntheir experience that the statute, as written, has not\ninterfered with the smooth functioning of chapter 7 cases.\nQUESTION: Are all trustees in chapter 7 cases\nUnited States Trustees? They're not, are they?\nMS. BLATT: None of them are. The United States\nTrustees supervise and oversee the administration of all\ncases under 7, 11, 12, and 13, and one of their specific\nduties is to supervise trustees, private trustees, who --\nwho perform their -- their jobs and duties as trustees.\nQUESTION: Even if the Government isn't involved\nin the case.\nMS. BLATT: Right. There's always a -- there's\nalways a private trustee appointed except in 11 cases, but\nthe United States Trustees supervises and oversees, serves\nas a watch dog, looks at things to make sure there's no\nwaste, fraud, or abuse, reviews all fee applications for\nthe -- by the trustee, the examiner, the debtor's counsel\nin chapter 11 cases, and --\nQUESTION: The bankruptcy judge appoints the\ntrustee.\nMS. BLATT: I don't know if -- Justice Ginsburg,\nI'm not sure whether it's the -- the bankruptcy court does\nappoint the trustee. That's right. But the United States\nTrustees within the Department of Justice manages a pool\nof available trustees who can serve to be appointed by\nbankruptcy courts. And so we oversee trustees and make\nsure they're fulfilling their duties.\nQUESTION: Does the bankruptcy court appoint a\nU.S. Trustee in every single case?\nMS. BLATT: No, no. There are -- no. There are\n21 United States Trustees that oversee all the regions of\nthis country, with the exception of North Carolina and\nAlabama, and they just overview and supervise the\nadministration of the cases in the sense of make sure that\nthe cases are actually proceeding through the court, make\nsure that cases that need to be converted --\nQUESTION: They -- they do that without any\nappointment by the bankruptcy court then I take it.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. Under 28 U.S.C. 586,\nit's -- it's a laundry list of specific statutory duties\nthat the United States Trustees have to comply with.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Code itself, in 11 U.S.C. 307, it\nsays that the United States Trustees may be -- may raise\nor be heard on any matter in any bankruptcy case, and\nthat's why they've been in all of these cases involving\nfee applications because in their view, given the -- that\nthere's just complete absence of any statutory authority\nto pay chapter 7 debtor's counsel, they've been objecting\nto fee requests.\nThe one thing I just want to get back to on the\nstatute is petitioner says that the statute is ambiguous,\nand we could not disagree more. There is no language in\nthe code that authorizes the chapter 7 to be paid. What\npetitioner has relied on is a missing or and this\noverlapping or redundant reference to attorney. But it's\ncritical to understand that nothing about the missing or\nor the reference to attorney in (a)(1)(A) affects the\nsubstantive meaning of the statute or in any way prohibits\nthe Court from applying the literal language of the code\nor requires the code to do -- requires the Court to do\nsomething the code prohibits.\nBy contrast, what petitioner is seeking is a\nsubstantive enlargement, and as far as we can tell, there\nis no case of this Court's jurisprudence where the Court\nhas added back language in a statute and where -- in a\nsubstantive way that Congress has specifically taken out\nwhen there's no language that will bear that\ninterpretation.\nIf there --\nQUESTION: If you're through, let me just --\nMS. BLATT: Sure.\nQUESTION: Maybe this is a little repetitious,\nbut I want to read you two sentences from Collier on\nBankruptcy, the treatise that most of us rely on perhaps\ntoo much in this area.\nAfter describing the Government's position in\nthis, it would represent a fundamental change in the law.\nThe treatise goes on. Section 329 of the code permits the\ndebtor's attorney to receive a reasonable retainer for\nservices rendered in contemplation of or to be rendered in\nconnection with a case under the Bankruptcy Code. Such a\nprovision would be superfluous if the deletion in section\n330(a) is construed as excepting debtor's counsel for\ncompensation under section 330.\nWhat's your response to that again? You've\npartly responded, but I want to be sure you cover it all.\nMS. BLATT: This is the reference to attorney,\nthe reference to attorney in (a)(1)(A).\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: Your Honor, it's -- the -- the short\nanswer it's -- it's in the wrong place. The critical\noperative list that provides the type of people who can\nreceive compensation is in (a)(1), and the reference to\nattorney just describes the type of compensable services,\nwhich also includes paralegals, para-professionals.\nQUESTION: No. They -- they rely on section\n329, which talks about --\nMS. BLATT: Oh, I'm -- 329.\nQUESTION: -- that that's -- they say section\n329 permits all this, and they say that provision would be\nsuperfluous if your reading of 330(a) is correct.\nMS. BLATT: Collier is just wrong. The\nprovision is --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: -- on this point -- is that it\noperates independently and requires a disclosure of all\nfee agreements whether or not there's compensation, and\nmaybe another way of putting it is is whether or not the\nCourt rewrites the code, 329 is going to apply as -- as it\nalways has and require a disclosure of -- of pre-petition\nfees.\nQUESTION: What was the -- the fees that were\nattributed to the chapter 11 phase, when approval was\nsought, wasn't that under 329 when -- there -- there was\nthe -- the lump sum $6,000, and something over $1,000 was\nattributed to the pre-petition chapter 11 time. Wasn't\nthe approval of that under this section 329?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, by both the\nbankruptcy court and the district court because they\nproceeded on the erroneous assumption, as found by the\nFourth Circuit, that this was money that belonged to the\nlawyer instead of the estate. And if it had been -- and\nthis was an 11 case. You don't see in chapter 7 large\npre-petition retainers like this because the chapter 11\nusually contemplates ongoing work after bankruptcy.\nBut in this case, they did what most lawyers do,\nis put the money in the trust account, and it wasn't\nearned -- it wasn't earned by the lawyer until the\nservices were performed. But the bankruptcy court and the\ntrial court proceeded on the assumption the money belonged\nto the lawyer, and so if the -- if the pre-petition money\nis money of the lawyers, then it's reviewed under 329.\nBut then the Fourth Circuit said, well, no, this\nis actually money of the estate and it has to be -- it's\nestate funds. Those are held for the benefit of creditors\nand there's no statutory authority to use estate funds to\npay the chapter 7 debtor's attorney.\nIf there are no questions, we'd ask the Court to\naffirm the Fourth Circuit's --\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Goldstein, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the reason\nthat the U.S. Trustees are not finding that this ambiguity\ncreates a problem is that there has been a shift in\npractice in those courts like the Fourth Circuit that hold\nthat you can't be compensated as a chapter 7 debtor's\nattorney under 330, and that is people in bigger cases are\ngetting bigger and bigger retainers. What's happening is\nthe scenario that Justice Stevens described, and that is,\npeople are saying I'm not going to be paid on an ongoing\nbasis, so I've got to get more money up front. That can't\nbe a result that Congress contemplated under the U.S.\nTrustees' vision of what Congress was up to --\nQUESTION: But can't that be checked by the\ncourt under 329 and say that's too much?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Precisely, precisely. But\nthat's my point. What results is the 329 fees are subject\nto a Lessing standard. They just have to be reasonable.\nThey aren't subjected to all the laundry list of 330. So\nthe result of this change, if there was a change, would\nonly have been to decrease judicial oversight. Retainers\nare subject to less judicial scrutiny.\nThe second point I should make is that don't\ncome away from the argument that this -- believing that\nthis case is limited to chapter 7. It applies equally to\nchapter 11 debtor out of possession cases and chapter 12\nand 13 cases for services that are beneficial to the\nestate, but not the debtor. The U.S. Trustee has always\npitched this as somehow a case limited to chapter 7, but\nthat's not accurate. And the Pro-Snax case from the Fifth\nCircuit, for example, is a chapter 11 debtor out of\npossession case.\nThird, Justice Souter, I still don't understand\nwhat the answer is to your reading of the statute.\nJustice Breyer, Justice Souter said, okay, there\nare a list of three people who can get the check: the\ntrustee, the examiner, the professional person. Fine.\nBut we also know, as Justice Stevens has said, that the\nstatute's reference to the attorney has always been to the\nattorney, the same reference to the attorney in 331 is a\nreference to the attorney. 321 says a chapter 7 attorney\ncan get a retainer. Justice Souter has said isn't the\nliteral language, if we're going to follow the literal\nlanguage, that the money can go to the trustee, to which I\nsaid, and that's -- you know, the trustee directed Mr.\nLamie to do these things, and therefore the trustee just\nowes the money back to the debtor's attorney. That\nrationalizes all of the text.\nThe important thing then in deciding whether to\nfollow the literal text is, is there anything to support?\nIs there a whit -- a whit -- of indication in the history\nof the statute that Congress intended to do what the U.S.\nTrustee has hypothesized? Is there a word that from 1898\nto 1994 Congress decided to make this choice to eliminate\nfees that are both necessary and beneficial? Those are\nthe only fees we're talking about, those that benefit the\ncreditors. Did Congress intend to eliminate them? Is\nthere any indication of that? And the answer to that\nquestion is no.\nAnd that's important because the U.S. Trustee is\nnot correct to say that when a chapter 7 is initiated or\nif the case is converted, that the debtor and the debtor's\nattorney leaves the field. There are ongoing duties.\nThere's the 341 hearing, the meeting with the creditors.\nThere is the duty of the debtor's attorney to transfer the\nmaterials to the trustee, to cooperate with the trustee.\nHere, there was an adversary proceeding. The trustee\nwasn't substituted as counsel for 8 months, and somebody\nhad to tell the trustee about that. There are real\nresponsibilities. And we're not talking about, in any\nparticular case, a ton of money, but it is important.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldstein.\n"
