        "content": "(10:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-403, the Federal Election Commission v.\nChristine Beaumont.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court's campaign finance cases consistently\nemphasize the fundamental distinction between\ncontributions and expenditures. Direct transfers of cash\nto a candidate pose unique risks of the appearance of\ncorruption or the threat of actual corruption while, at\nthe same time, imposing less significant interference with\nFirst Amendment values. And so this Court's jurisprudence\nconsistently recognizes that there is less rigorous\nscrutiny on limitations on contributions relative to\nlimitations on expenditures.\nThe court below lost sight of that fundamental\ndichotomy. It held that corporations of the type that\nthis Court exempted from the general limitations on\ncorporate expenditures in Massachusetts Citizens for Life\nwere equally exempt from the broad prohibitions on\ncorporate contributions to candidates. That reasoning\nignores this Court's decision in Massachusetts Citizens\nfor Life itself, which specifically distinguished between\nthe expenditures and contributions of nonprofit\ncorporations.\nMore fundamentally, the decision below ignores\nthis Court's decision in National Right to Work Committee.\nThere this Court held that the broad limitations on\ncorporate contributions and the specific limitations on\nsolicitation embedded in that broad prohibition were\nconstitutional against a First Amendment challenge.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, the Government does --\ndoes not challenge the exemption of this not-for-profit\ncorporation from expenditure limitations?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Scalia. The\ncourt below addressed both an expenditure issue and a\nprohibition issue with respect to contributions, and the\nGovernment only took up the prohibition on contributions.\nSo that is the only issue before the Court.\nI think it's important, though, to understand\nthat that is a distinction that the court below placed\ninsufficient emphasis on because that is a distinction\nbetween contributions and expenditures that underlies the\nlast quarter century of this Court's campaign finance\njurisprudence.\nAnd in National Right to Work Committee itself,\nthis Court recognized that the broad prohibitions on\ncontributions applied to all corporations, including those\nlike National Right to Work Committee itself that were\nwithout great financial resources.\nNonetheless, in the particular context of\ncorporate contributions to candidates, this Court held\nthat it would not second guess Congress' decision that a\nbroad, prophylactic approach was necessary when corruption\nwas the evil feared.\nQUESTION: Do you think after the decision in\nMassachusetts -- the Massachusetts case, the NRWC would\nhave a right to make independent expenditures?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it would, Chief\nJustice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to\nfirst is your dissent in that case because in that case in\nyour dissent, you made the argument that National Right to\nWork Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life. And the majority, in responding to\nthat argument, didn't draw any particular distinction\nbetween National Right to Work Committee and Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life, but rather drew a firm distinction\nbetween the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations\non contributions and the level of scrutiny that applies to\nlimitations on expenditures.\nSo I would read that decision as saying that the\ncritical distinction is not the differences among the\ntypes of corporations with respect to contribution bans,\nbut is the fact that contribution bans are much more\nreadily approved under First Amendment analysis than\nexpenditure bans.\nAnd National Right to Work Committee obviously\nwasn't the last word on that subject. This Court\nreaffirmed the validity of a broad, prophylactic approach\nto corporate contributions both in National Conservative\nPolitical Action Committee and in Massachusetts Citizens\nfor Life itself. Particularly, in light of Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life, a ban on corporate contributions by\nnonprofits does not impose significant burdens on First\nAmendment interests.\nIn the particular context of this type of\ncorporation, the corporation is free to engage in\nunlimited spending on elections through the corporate\nform, and the individual respondents are free to give\nunlimited contributions to North Carolina Right to Life.\nIn addition and equally important, the individual members\nof North Carolina Right to Life are free to give\ncontributions to the candidates of their choice up to the\nconstitutionally valid contribution limits.\nAccordingly, this case doesn't involve the right\nto associate together or the right to associate with\ncandidates of someone's individual choosing, but only the\nright to assemble together collectively to give money to\ncandidates of an organization's collective choosing. And\neven that rather attenuated First Amendment interest is\nonly affected to the extent that a corporation must direct\nits contributions through a separate segregated fund with\nenhanced disclosure and reporting and bookkeeping\nrequirements.\nQUESTION: Why -- why is that an attenuated\nFirst Amendment right? Isn't that the right that enables\nthe formation of political parties, people forming\ntogether in order to collectively give money to particular\ncandidates?\nMR. CLEMENT:\npoint, parties are subject to a different type of\nregulation under the campaign finance laws.\nBut secondly --\nQUESTION: Well, it may well be, but -- but I --\nI wouldn't shrug off as inconsequential the importance of\nindividuals being able to band together to support\nindividual candidates. That's the whole basis for our --\nour party system.\nMR. CLEMENT: And -- and I don't want to suggest\nthat there's no First Amendment interest on the other side\nof -- of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to\nsuggest is that interest is less significant than the\ninterest in individuals banding together to make\nexpenditures that they might otherwise not be able to\nmake.\nAnd I think even in the party context, this\nCourt recognized that distinction in the Colorado\nRepublican cases where it held that limitations on what\nthe -- the party can spend to support a candidate are not\nsubject to limitation, but what -- but there -- but there\nare valid limitations on what the party can contribute to\na candidate of its choosing.\nNow, in contrast to the rather minimal First\nAmendment interests that are interfered with by section\n441b, it plays an important role in safeguarding the\nintegrity of the election process. This Court in -- in\nNational Right to Work Committee already has recognized\nthat corporate contributions pose a risk of the reality\nand appearance of corruption and that a broad,\nprophylactic limitation on all corporations, including\nthose without great financial resources, is an appropriate\nresponse to that threat.\nAll corporations, regardless of their size, also\npose risks of circumvention and of undermining the\nworkability of candidate disclosure requirements.\nAs this Court recognized in Cedric Kushner\nPromotions against King, the whole point of a corporation,\nits basic purpose and fundamental reason for -- for\nexisting is to create legal separateness between the\nindividuals that form and run the corporation and the\nartificial corporate entity itself.\nGiving such an artificial entity the right to\ncontribute in its own name, independent of the individuals\nthat underlie the corporation, obviously poses a distinct\nrisk to a campaign finance system that is based largely on\nindividual contribution limits. Section 441b addresses\nthat risk by requiring that those contributions be made\nthrough a segregated fund subject to enhanced bookkeeping\nand disclosure requirements.\nThose bookkeeping and disclosure requirements,\nin turn, make the campaign disclosure forms that\nindividual candidates have to file work in a meaningful\nfashion. If those candidate disclosure forms simply\nrevealed that the candidate received money from an\nartificial entity with either an ambiguous name or what\nthis Court in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley\ntermed a seductive name that tends to conceal the true\nidentity and true source of the funds, then those campaign\nfinance forms -- or disclosure forms will not provide\nmeaningful information.\nIf, on the other hand, 441b makes the underlying\ncorporations use a segregated fund that discloses the\nindividual sources of the contributions, then the\ndisclosure forms can work in a meaningful fashion.\nI think it bears emphasis, as this Court\nrecognized in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the\ndistinction between contributions and expenditures applies\nwith full force in the context of nonprofit organizations.\nA limitation on expenditures can prevent an organization's\nmembers, who might otherwise not have the resources to\nreach a certain audience, to pool their resources together\nto reach that audience.\nThere is no comparable function or benefit from\nthe pooling of individual candidate contributions. The\nindividual candidates themselves can perform that pooling\nfunction by assembling together candidate contributions of\nwhatever size in order to reach an audience or to engage\nin political speech.\nThe intermediate pooling function that the\nnonprofit corporation serves can only benefit by either\ncircumventing the individual contribution requirements or\nassembling an aggregate contribution of a sufficient size\nto potentially capture the attention of a candidate for\npurposes of a quid pro quo. To be sure, the same\nprovisions of the campaign finance laws allow corporations\nto assemble funds in -- in aggregate amounts through a\nsegregated fund, but only with the additional safeguards\nthat are imposed, including enhanced disclosure\nrequirements.\nCongress, in adopting section 441b, drew an\nimportant distinction between corporations and their\nability to contribute and individuals. In the expenditure\ncontext, the limitations on corporate expenditures stand\nin stark contrast to the general right of individuals to\nengage in unlimited independent expenditures.\nBut no one has a right to engage in unlimited\ncorporate -- in unlimited contributions to candidates.\nCongress addresses the threat of individual contributions\nthrough dollar amounts. It addresses the distinct risks\nof corporate contributions through the requirement of a\nsegregated fund, higher limits, and enhanced disclosure\nrequirements.\nRespondents effectively ask this Court to\ndisregard and second guess Congress' decision to treat\ncorporations differently from individuals for purposes of\ncandidate contributions. With respect, I think\nessentially respondents ask this Court to treat North\nCarolina Right --\nQUESTION: Can you summarize briefly what the\nenhanced disclosure requirements are?\nMR. CLEMENT: Certainly, Chief Justice\nRehnquist. The -- the main difference is that in the\ncontext of a segregated fund, all -- both all incoming\ncontributions to the segregated fund and all disbursements\nmust be disclosed.\nQUESTION: You're talking about PACs. Right?\nMR. CLEMENT: PACs. I mean, the PACs generally\n-- there are segregated funds in the particular context of\ncorporations and labor unions.\nQUESTION: And the donor is listed.\nMR. CLEMENT: The donor is listed. There are\nspecific provisions for very small donations where the\nname only goes to the FEC and is not publicly disclosed.\nBut there's a -- but really, everything that comes in and\ncomes out of the segregated fund is traceable either by\nthe FEC or through the public in disclosure requirements.\nIn the context of the corporation generally,\nonly -- only donations that are given over $200 and for\nthe express purpose of -- of political activity have to be\ndisclosed. And that does create a significant loophole.\nIn the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, is this -- is this\nsection 441b related or affected in any way by the McCain-\nFeingold legislation?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, it really isn't,\nat least as this case comes to this Court. The\nprohibitions on corporate contributions have been in the\nlaw since 1907 and have been left completely unaffected by\nthe Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.\nIt is true that certain limitations on\nelectioneering activity, which is a new term introduced\ninto the law by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform\nAct, do apply to corporations. So in considering\nchallenges to the McCain-Feingold legislation, this Court\nmay have to consider the restrictions on corporations\nengaged in expenditures and these new electioneering\nactivities, but not --\nQUESTION: But at least the issue here in this\ncase is unaffected by that.\nMR. CLEMENT:\ncontributions is miraculously unaffected by the many\nreforms that are put in place by the Bipartisan Campaign\nReform Act.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: In the end --\nQUESTION: What is the -- what is the limitation\nof the PAC? How much can they contribute, say, to a\nSenator?\nMR. CLEMENT: A -- a political action committee\nor any segregated fund can give $5,000.\nQUESTION: This -- this -- you're saying that\nthis particular kind of organization can't contribute\ndirectly, but it could set up a -- what you call a\nsegregated fund, which I was thinking of as a PAC. And so\nif that segregated fund now wants to make a contribution\nto Senator Smith for his reelection campaign, is there a\nlimit as to how much they can give? I'd think so.\nMR. CLEMENT: There is indeed, Justice Breyer.\nIt's $5,000.\nQUESTION: $5,000.\nMR. CLEMENT: And two points of emphasis just on\nthat question. One is that respondents here don't just\nhave the right to set up a segregated fund, but they've\nactually already done that. They've already set up a\nsegregated fund.\nMassachusetts Citizens for Life emphasized that there are\nunique restrictions and burdens on setting up a segregated\nfund, and I think that's true in the context of\nexpenditures.\nBut I do think it's easy to exaggerate the\nburdens that are imposed in setting up a segregated fund.\nAlthough a segregated fund is like a PAC, there's no\nrequirement that they have separate offices or separate\nofficers. They have to have a distinct leadership and --\nand -- but it can be the same leadership as the\ncorporation itself.\nQUESTION: I mean, could they have two members?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't know of any particular\nlimit on -- on the members.\nBut the point is all that's really required is\nsegregation of funds and keeping it separate. It's not an\nonerous requirement. And I think it's no accident that in\nthe four cases that this Court has had that involved a\nnonprofit corporation, National Right to Work Committee,\nMassachusetts Citizens for Life, Austin against Michigan\nChamber of Commerce, and this case, all four of those\nnonprofits had already set up segregated funds before the\ncase got to this Court. So I don't think, at least in the\ncontribution context, that those are onerous requirements.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: In Massachusetts Citizens for Life,\nthere was a separate PAC?\nMR. CLEMENT: There was. This Court in footnote\n8 suggested that that wasn't dispositive of its reasoning\nbecause other -- other entities could set -- be in a\nposition that were similar to Massachusetts Citizens for\nLife, might not be able to afford those burdens. But\nMassachusetts Citizens --\nQUESTION: But the Court did say for that type\nof -- for that type of corporation, not a commercial\ncorporation, that was burdensome and unnecessary because\nthe risk of corruption for that kind of corporation was\nsignificantly less than for commercial corporations. And\nthat would apply here as well. If the -- if the evil is\ncorruption, I'm buying the candidate by my dollars, then\nthat risk is less for an advocacy organization. Is that\n-- isn't --\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't want to suggest that the\n-- that it may not be true that the risks are slightly\nless in the context of a nonprofit advocacy corporation\nthan in the context of something like General Motors.\nBut I think in the particular context of\ncandidate contributions by corporations, this Court has\nrepeatedly decided that it's willing to accept a broad,\nprophylactic approach and to limit all corporate\ncontributions, including contributions by corporations\nwithout great financial resources. The Court said as much\nin National Right to Work Committee. It repeated that\nagain in National Conservative Political Action Committee,\nbut I think most tellingly, it said that in Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life itself.\nAnd in particular, if you look at footnote 13 of\nthe Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision, the Court\nthere specifically said that it understood that\nMassachusetts Citizens for Life would continue to be\nsubjected to the National Right to Work Committee regime\nfor purposes of its contributions, and it was talking\nabout the fact that it didn't have -- that Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life, for example, didn't have shareholders.\nBut it was quick to -- to reinforce that that didn't mean\nthat it didn't have members for purposes of National Right\nto Work Committee that it could solicit, subject of course\nto the overall limit that it could not give direct\ncontributions to candidates.\nQUESTION: That was an assumption in the case.\nYou don't -- you don't -- you don't assert that it was a\nholding of the case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it's\nnecessarily the holding of the case because, obviously,\nthat case involved expenditures.\nthis Court distinguishes a prior precedent of the Court,\nthat that's not a part of the opinion that a lower court\nis free to ignore. I think that part of the opinion is\ncritical to the reasoning of the Court and should be given\nstare decisis effect. And I don't think there's any\nreason that's been brought to bear here to revisit this\nCourt's distinction in Massachusetts Citizens for Life\nbetween contributions and expenditures, which after all,\nis the fundamental building block of this Court's campaign\nfinance jurisprudence.\nQUESTION: You think whenever we distinguish a\nprior case in one of our opinions, that -- that\ndistinguishing has stare decisis effect.\nMR. CLEMENT: I would think that in many\nrespects that's the most important part of the opinion.\nIt's not to say that the Court can't subsequently revisit\nthat part of the opinion. I mean, that's certainly what\nthis Court can do, but I think for purposes of a lower\ncourt, anyway, if -- if this Court distinguishes two cases\non the ground that the prior case involved a corporation\nthat had less than $10,000 and a subsequent case comes\nalong where there's $9,999 involved, I would think the\nlower court would be well served to heed the distinction\nthat this Court drew. And I think in this particular\ncontext, obviously, this Court is free to reconsider its\nprior precedents, but I don't think there's any reason to\ndo so.\nThe distinction between contributions and\nexpenditures has proved workable particularly in the\ncontext of nonprofit corporations. As I say, this isn't\nsome abstract application of the contribution/expenditure\ndichotomy that this Court has never considered.\nMassachusetts Citizens for Life involved a nonprofit\ncorporation and this Court was at pains, pretty much at\nevery step in the Court's reasoning, to distinguish\nbetween contributions and expenditures.\nIn the end, I think respondents ask this Court\neffectively to disregard Congress' decision to treat\ncorporate contributions distinctly from individual\ncontributions. They effectively ask this Court to treat\nNorth Carolina Right to Life Incorporated as if it were\nnot incorporated, but there's no reason to disregard\neither respondents' decision to incorporate or Congress'\ndecision to subject all corporations to the same regime,\nsegregated funds, distinct disclosure requirements, and\nhigher limits, in fact, on their contributions.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe rest of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Bopp, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BOPP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nExpressive associations play a vital role in our\ndemocratic republic. Because they attract financial\nsupport due to their political ideas, not their prowess in\nthe economic marketplace, their participation in our\npolitical process poses no threat of corruption, as long\nas they do not serve as a conduit for business corporation\ncontributions.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't understand that. If --\nif I bribe somebody, a Senator, out of -- out of political\nmotivation because I'm an environmentalist or whatever,\nthat's not corruption? It's only -- it's only if I have\nsome economic motive that it's corruption?\nMR. BOPP: Well, that's classic quid pro quo\ncorruption which is dealt with by contribution limits,\nnow --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, I -- it may well be,\nbut I don't see that the distinction between whether it's\nan economic actor or a political actor has anything to do\nwith whether there's corruption or not.\nMR. BOPP: Well, there has been some controversy\non this Court on -- on whether or not the -- the decisions\nof this Court in Mass. Citizens and on Austin were in\naccordance with the Constitution, but in both cases the\nCourt distinguished between the types of corruption that\nare entailed by the corporate form, which is the potential\nfor unfair employment of wealth for political purposes.\nThis applies to economic corporations, that -- that is,\nthose that are not, as Mass. Citizens or North Carolina\nRight to Life, formed to advance political ideas.\nQUESTION: Well, but you can have an immense\ncorporation formed to advance political ideas. I -- I\ndon't -- this one happens to be a small one, but --\nMR. BOPP: Yes. And --\nQUESTION: -- if you attract enough people, you\ncan have an immense organization. What's the organization\nfor -- American Association of Retired Persons. I mean,\nthat's an immense organization with -- with a large amount\nof available money.\nMR. BOPP: That's right and the size of the\norganization is not the issue. The issue in this Court's\njurisprudence is whether -- is the nature of the\norganization itself and not the corporate form per se. If\nthe nature of --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Bopp, would you say that\nthe AARP, which was referred to by Justice Scalia, the\nNational Right to Work Committee, which was involved in\nthat opinion, and Massachusetts Citizens for Life are all\nin the same boat?\nMR. BOPP: I don't believe so, Your Honor. I\nthink we do --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. BOPP: Well, the -- the Court in Mass.\nCitizens established some criteria to determine whether or\nnot an organization, a corporation, benefitted from the\nMCFL exemption. And those include whether or not there\nare incentives to disassociate -- lack of incentives to\ndisassociate by, for instance, having insurance plans and\nother benefits of membership that are economically\nrelated.\nSecondly, you would look to the amount of\ncorporate -- business corporation contributions or\nbusiness activities. If those are too much or those are\nnot insignificant, in -- in comparison with the total sums\nraised, then again they would not qualify.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, on that point I thought\nthat Massachusetts Citizens for Life went further. It\nsaid having a policy against accepting corporate\ncontributions, which is one difference between your\norganization and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. They\nsaid they would take no money from corporations. You\naccept money from corporations.\nbusiness corporations, but you don't have a policy of\nturning them away.\nMR. BOPP: That's correct, Your Honor. And the\n-- all the circuits that have considered this, which have\nbeen four of the circuits, all agree that the features\nexplained and -- and characterizing Mass. Citizens in --\nin the Supreme Court's decision were not constitutional\nrequirements, but descriptions of the organization before\nit. And all of them have agreed that -- that not-for-\nprofit ideological corporations can still qualify for the\n-- for the Massachusetts Citizens exemption.\nQUESTION: Well, would you call AARP an\nideological organization?\nMR. BOPP: I think they have a mixture of\npolitical and nonpolitical purposes and are, therefore,\nmore like Austin -- the -- the Michigan Chamber of\nCommerce and Austin that had a mixture of political and\nnonpolitical purposes and therefore did not qualify for\nthe MCFL exemption.\nAnd to complete my answer --\nQUESTION: I'll bet the members also get\nbenefits --\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and -- and that criterion would --\nwould make it different from --\nMR. BOPP: There were also incentives that were\neconomic in nature that would cause people to be reluctant\nto disassociate with Michigan Chamber of Commerce if it --\nif it proved to be that they disagreed with their\npolitical ideas or the advancement of their political\nideas.\nAnd the four circuits that have considered the\nquestion of the amount of business corporation\ncontributions have all said that as long as they are\ninsignificant, in comparison with the total revenue of the\norganization, they still -- they do not serve as a conduit\nfor business corporation contributions and still qualify\nfor the exemption.\nQUESTION: But they could serve as a conduit for\na very large donor, a very wealthy person, who wants to\navoid the personal limitations on how much that individual\ncould give.\nMR. BOPP: Well, it is true that there are no\ncontribution limits to not-for-profit corporations.\nHowever, the intent of a donor to circumvent those limits\nwould be -- contributing to a not-for-profit would be a\nhighly inefficient and ineffective way of doing so because\nthe political activities of not-for-profit corporations,\nboth because of the major purpose test that would cause an\norganization to become a PAC if political activity became\ntheir major purpose, and the Internal Revenue Service's\nlimitations on the activities of 501(c)(4) organizations,\nwhich is what the regulations require you to be qualified\nas in -- in order to quality for the MCFL exemption, all\n-- all mean that a very small percentage of any\ncontribution to a not-for-profit corporation could ever be\nused for political activity.\nFurthermore, contributing to a not-for-profit\nversus a PAC and a -- or a political party is also an\nunfavorable prospect for a donor. I mean, after all, the\n-- a not-for-profit under the 441a contribution limits is\nlimited to a $2,000 contribution, where a PAC can give\n$5,000 and political parties can give much more.\nFurthermore, all of the money that PACs or\npolitical parties receive in their hard money accounts can\nbe used for political activity, whereas I've mentioned for\nnot-for-profits it's really a very small percentage in\norder to continue to qualify under the MCFL exemption and\ncontinue to not be deemed a PAC for -- for the purposes of\nthe Federal Election Campaign Act.\nNow, the disclosure interest that there -- that\nthere is for contributions can be readily and in a\nnarrowly tailored way dealt with by simply requiring that\nany contribution to a not-for-profit that is to be used\nfor or is intended to be used for contributions to\ncandidates must be reported and is -- and is thereby\nsubject to the aggregate contribution limits. This is a\nmuch more narrowly tailored way to deal with disclosure\nand the aggregate contribution limits than prohibiting the\norganization completely from making any contribution.\nQUESTION: What you do then -- this is what I\nunderstand you to be saying. The -- one of their\njustifications that has been advanced for this restriction\non contributions I've interpreted as the following. We\nhave five people. These five people each write a check to\nCandidate Smith for $2,000. They get annoyed. They think\nthey should be able to give $4,000, which the law forbids.\nSo they form a committee, a nonprofit corporation, called\nthe $4,000 for Smith Corporation.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And now each of them writes another\ncheck for $2,000, gives it to the corporation, and the\ncorporation gives it to Smith. And I think the Government\nsays, well, Congress wanted to stop that. It's not\nactually going to limit them to zero. They're going to be\nlimited to $5,000 as a group provided they jump through\ncertain hoops.\nAll right. Now, what's --\nMR. BOPP: Well, if they're a PAC --\nQUESTION:\nMR. BOPP: Well, if they're -- if they're a PAC,\nthen they can give $5,000 out of the -- out of the $10,000\nthat you posit. If they're a not-for-profit corporation,\nthe most they can give --\nQUESTION: I know, but do you see what I'm\nsaying? I'm saying Congress doesn't want to have groups\ncalled the $4,000 for Smith group even if they call\nthemselves something different.\nMR. BOPP: I agree.\nQUESTION: They want to limit each of those\nmembers to $2,000.\nMR. BOPP: Agreed.\nQUESTION: And that's what they do, though for a\nvariety of other reasons, not directly relevant to my\nquestion, they've allowed those people to get together,\njump through various hoops called the PAC hoops, and give\nup to $5,000 extra. So if Congress wanted to, they might\nsay none.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, that's their --\nthat's basically the argument, and I want to get a\nstraight, you know, direct reply to it.\nMR. BOPP: Well, the -- the desire of subjecting\nthe aggregate contribution limit or a contribution in\nexcess of $2,000, one direct and one through another\nsource, is dealt with two ways and can be.\nOne is if the contribution made to this group\nthat you posit is earmarked, then that contribution is\nconsidered to be a contribution not just to the group but\nalso to the candidate him or herself. So that earmarked\ncontribution is subject to the $2,000 limit, and the\ncontribution used for that would be in violation of the\nact currently.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. So now -- is that --\nMR. BOPP: That is current law. And -- and so\nthat prospect is prohibited and appropriately so.\nSecondly, as the Federal Election Campaign Act\npreviously required, that anyone contributing to a\norganization, not a PAC, that contributes money for an\nindependent expenditure, that that contribution must be\nreported by the group that does the independent\nexpenditure. Congress could require the same thing here.\nThey could require money given more generally, not\nearmarked, but more generally for candidates to be\nreported by the -- the group and thereby subject to the\naggregate contribution limits.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, isn't it also the case that\nthe -- that the corporation that Justice Breyer posits\nwould not qualify as -- as a 501 exempt organization if\nthe only thing it's using its money for is to make\ncontributions to political candidates?\nMR. BOPP: That would also be true. They --\nQUESTION: I'm just trying --\nQUESTION: It has to be -- it has to be a\nrelatively insignificant part of its overall activity.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. The Internal Revenue Service\nwould treat the organization that he described as a\npolitical organization --\nQUESTION: So these five people would had to --\nhave to get together with maybe 100,000 other people so\nthat their -- their little portion is so watered down that\nit's not a significant part of the corporation's business.\nMR. BOPP: That's exactly --\nQUESTION: I didn't think there was a numerical\nlimit. And my question which tried to eliminate\nextraneous points I think you understood perfectly well\nthere. I mean a 503(c) corporation but -- et cetera.\nBut I want to go back to your answer. The --\nthe -- because I'm trying to get clear about this. And\nthe -- what you're saying is that Congress could take my\ngroup, with whatever else they have to do to qualify them\n-- they could take my group and you're saying Congress\ncould just say, very well, we will limit the corporation\nso that it can only give money from these five people\ninsofar as they haven't met their $2,000 individual limit.\nMR. BOPP: That would be an effect of what I\nsaid, yes.\nQUESTION: And -- and moreover, it could require\nreporting so we know who they are.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, is that a less\nrestrictive alternative than what Congress has actually\ndone, which is to say, proceed through a segregated fund?\nMR. BOPP: Yes, much less restrictive.\nQUESTION: Because? Because?\nMR. BOPP: Well, because this Court held in\nMass. Citizens and Austin that the PAC requirements, both\nadministrative, including record keeping, appointment of a\ntreasurer, filing regular reports, et cetera, and the\nlimits that are imposed upon PACs -- there's a $5,000\ncontribution limit to PACs, et cetera -- all impose an --\na constitutionally burden -- a burden on constitutionally\nexercised rights that did not -- that did not pass\nconstitutional muster. So -- so while it is true that you\ncan do it under a PAC, that imposes an unconstitutional\nburden on the First Amendment activities.\nAnd that, of course, all goes back to, you know,\nis there a justification for this. In other words, we\nhave a prohibited source --\nQUESTION: Well, just before you go on, I don't\nsee why your proposal doesn't have all of the same\nadministrative inconveniences.\nMR. BOPP: Well, there's a one-page report.\nThere are organizations that can do independent\nexpenditures that are not PACs. There's a one -- one-\npage report to file, and that -- and that report would say\nhow much is being spent on the independent expenditure and\nhow much has been donated to the organization for the\npurpose of that independent expenditure.\nSimilarly, a report like that could be filed for\ncontributions so that we could capture those people who\nare trying to circumvent the limits to -- to make\nundisclosed or excessive contributions. We would capture\nthem because then the only choice left to the donor would\nbe a completely undifferentiated, unearmarked contribution\nthat is going to be used by the organization 95, 98\npercent for other purposes, for lobbying, for education,\nfor other charitable activity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, the Court basically decided\nthis issue in National Right to Work Committee case,\ndidn't it? You just want us to distinguish your type of\nnonprofit corporation.\nMR. BOPP: Well, we are asking you to\ndistinguish the Massachusetts Citizens for Life type --\nQUESTION: I think that's very hard to do. I\nmean, we dealt with this precise issue in that case.\nMR. BOPP: But there was no issue in that case\nabout whether or not the organization itself should not be\nviewed as a prohibited source of -- of making independent\nexpenditures or making contributions in that case.\nQUESTION: But the organization opted for the\ncorporate form --\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- knowing about these limitations.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, but this Court has -- was clear\nin Mass. Citizens that it's not the corporate form per se,\nbut the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for\npolitical purposes and held that these types of\norganizations pose no threat, no threat whatsoever.\nQUESTION: Well, it couldn't have been a holding\nin -- in the Massachusetts case because there you were\ntalking about independent expenditures rather than\ncontributions.\nMR. BOPP: Well, but -- but --\nQUESTION: Certainly the Massachusetts case\ndoesn't control the outcome here.\nMR. BOPP: Well, we -- we believe that it --\nthat the holding of the Court in Mass. Citizens -- that\nthis organization serves no potential for corruption of\nthe democratic process, was essential for the Court to\nhold that no independent -- that independent expenditures\nwould be allowed because, after all --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, at least three times in the\ntext of the Court's opinion in Massachusetts Citizens for\nLife, at least three times, it distinguishes direct\ncontributions to candidates from expenditures, and each\ntime it explains why it reached the result it did. It\nmakes that distinction.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I think that -- that that's so\ncentral to Massachusetts Citizens for Life. So if -- if\nwe just had this opinion shorn of all but however,\nremember that this is not a contribution to a candidate\nand then citing back to the -- the earlier decision that\nJustice O'Connor mentioned, the National Right to Work\nCommittee, to distinguish it from this case, but it just\nseems so all over Massachusetts Citizens for Life that it\nis drawing this bright line between contributions to\ncandidates and independent expenditures.\nMR. BOPP: But in -- but in Right to Work, it\nwasn't a prohibition on contributions. It was a -- a\nlimit on the amount of contributions. And we agree that\nlimits on amounts --\nQUESTION:\nMassachusetts Citizens for Life and the line that Justice\nBrennan drew in the Massachusetts Citizens for Life\nbetween contributions to candidates. Every time he talks\nabout the holding in this case, he said, remember, this is\nnot contributions to candidates.\nMR. BOPP: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.\nThat's what you said. But the -- the case did not involve\n-- neither Mass. Citizens nor Right to Work involved a\nlimit on the amount of contributions, that is, like a\n$2,000 limit. We have not challenged that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, do you challenge the\ndistinction for First Amendment purposes between\nrestricting contributions and restricting expenditures?\nMR. BOPP: Only as to a prohibition on them.\nThat is, this Court in Buckley and reaffirmed in Shrink\nsaid that there were both speech and association aspects\nof making a contribution. That is, it's a -- as far as\nspeech is concerned, this is a general expression of\nsupport that is found in the undifferentiated act of\ncontributing.\nWell, here they are prohibited from\ncontributing. They cannot -- these organizations cannot\ngive one cent. Therefore, that's --\nQUESTION: So -- so you're -- you're saying\nthere is a distinction --\nMR. BOPP: Yes, as to a prohibition.\nQUESTION: -- for -- for valid First Amendment\npurposes between the -- the contribution limit and the --\nand the expenditure limit, but that distinction is not\nstrong enough to forbid an entire prohibition.\nMR. BOPP: That's correct because both the\nspeech aspects and association aspects of contributing\nthat are -- that remain after limits on the amounts are\nimposed because the speech aspect is a general expression\nof support and the association aspect is to serve to\naffiliate a person with the candidate. You have your name\nnow through the -- the method of the contribution\naffiliated with the candidate.\nWhen you have a zero contribution limit, then\nthere is no speech and no association that is allowed\nthrough the act of contributing. Therefore --\nQUESTION: But you can say -- you can --\nQUESTION: I don't think any of our cases have\nsliced the onion quite that fine to get into these nuances\nthat there's a difference between prohibiting a\ncontribution and limiting it. I think our distinctions\nhave been primarily that contributions may be quite\nsubstantially regulated, independent expenditures cannot\nbe.\nMR. BOPP:\ncorrect characterization of your jurisprudence, but you\nhave to examine why. Why is it that contributions are\nsubject to a lower level of scrutiny? And the -- the why\nis is that the speech and association aspects of giving a\nsmaller contribution remain, but if you can't give any\ncontribution, then both that speech and association\naspect --\nQUESTION: But when you say can't give any, you\nare overlooking or saying the PAC doesn't count.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: It isn't an absolute no contribution.\nIt is, if you do it, you have to do it through this arm\nthat you create, this segregated fund, this 501 -- of the\n501(c)(4) organization. You can -- you can do it but you\nhave to do it in a rather cumbersome way.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: So it isn't you cannot make any\ncontributions.\nMR. BOPP: Well, not only is it cumbersome, but\nit's constitutionally -- it's an unconstitutional burden\nthis Court has held in Mass. Citizens and in Austin to\nrequire First Amendment political activity to be done\nthrough a PAC. So --\nQUESTION: Not First Amendment activity in -- in\nthe Massachusetts case itself, as I just said. I don't\nwant to repeat that except that Justice Brennan did repeat\nit at least three times.\nMR. BOPP: Yes. And I'm aware of that, but I'm\njust asking this Court to -- to consider not -- not to\napply what is dicta in Mass. Citizens since it did not\ninvolve contributions -- to -- to just apply that, but to\nconsider the rationale.\nAnd in North -- in -- in National Right to Work,\nthe Court was considering not a prohibition on soliciting\ncontributions from members to its PAC, it was considering\na limit on what is considered to be a member. So once\nagain, that case involved contribution limits, not\nprohibition.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, that -- that First\nAmendment right that you talk about as the associational\ninterest, the -- the ability to give at least a dollar\nwill identify you with a -- with the candidate, is that\nreally a First Amendment interest that applies to the\nassociation, or does it apply to the members of the\nassociation? And as Mr. Clement pointed out, the\nindividual members of the association remain free to give\na dollar, indeed up to $2,000, to the particular\ncandidate.\nAll you're really talking about here is -- is\nnot the ability of individuals to identify themselves with\na candidate, but the ability of individuals by pooling\ntheir resources to help a candidate significantly. It\nseems to me that that's the only interest at -- at issue\nhere.\nMR. BOPP: Well, there's valid reasons unlike\nthe representation -- or the argument of the Government\nfor people to want to pool their resources in an\nassociation. That those valid reasons are, in fact, why\npeople already contribute to PACs and the political party\n--\nQUESTION: But among those reasons is not in\norder to identify myself with that candidate.\nMR. BOPP: Well, but the --\nQUESTION: To -- to do that, all you have to do\nis reach in your pocket and give them a dollar.\nMR. BOPP: That is true, but many people choose\nto pool their resources because they want the group, which\nhas a separate existence and has a political purpose,\nunlike them as an individual -- you know, they are not as\nidentified with a particular point of view or political\nidea like a group would be, like -- like NARAL would be.\nSo if -- so they choose then to pool their resources with\nthe group in order to make the much more powerful\nstatement about the political ideas that they are\nattempting to support and they want candidates to be\nassociated with.\nNow, in addition, the fact that the group can\naggregate these small contributions and then make a large\ncontribution to a particular candidate enhances the -- the\ncontribution that the individual would otherwise made --\nbe made because it is being done by the group and in an\naggregate. So there are justifiable reasons why people\nwant to associate.\nAnd then further, the association --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bopp, it seems to me that your\nargument really would go just the same way to an amount\nlimitation as to a total prohibition.\nMR. BOPP: No, because amount limitations do\nnot --\nQUESTION: Everybody can just contribute $10.\nWouldn't that -- would that be okay with you?\nMR. BOPP: You mean the -- the amount that --\nQUESTION: Say the amount limitation was very\nlow. As I understand it, you're trying to draw a\ncategorical distinction between total prohibition and\namount limitation.\nMR. BOPP: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I don't know -- I don't see that\nyour argument really is directed to that.\nMR. BOPP:\nof the rights, the First Amendment rights, that are\nimplicated by a -- by an amount limitation as opposed to a\nprohibition.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me an amount\nlimitation that's very, very low would have the same vice\nunder your argument as a total prohibition.\nMR. BOPP: Well, potentially, but that would be\na case to be a decided at that point. And -- now, this\nCourt has upheld the $5,000 limit, for instance, to\npolitical action committees. And -- but you would have to\nconsider -- if it got too low, I mean, there's certainly a\npotential for contributions that are too low -- as\nJustices Breyer and Ginsburg explained in Shrink, there is\ncertainly a potential if they're too low to be\nunconstitutional.\nBut here we're not talking about and have not\nchallenged the -- the $2,000 limit. We accept that. We\njust don't accept the proposition that because the\norganization poses no threat of corruption to the\npolitical process, that they should be completely\nprohibited from making a contribution.\nSo -- so we view this then as a source\nlimitation, not as an amount limitation, and as a result,\nthe -- the contribution jurisprudence of this Court that\nhave accepted greater regulation of contributions is not\napplicable.\nIf there are no other questions, thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.\nMr. Clement, you have 11 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nLet me begin with the distinction that\nrespondents rely on between limits on contributions and\nprohibitions on contributions. Even if there is something\nto that distinction -- and I rather doubt there is for\nsome of the reasons unearthed by Justice Stevens' colloquy\nwith -- with counsel for respondent. Even if that were a\nvalid distinction, this case does not involve an absolute\nprohibition.\nThis Court, both in Massachusetts Citizens for\nLife and Austin, and in fact, much earlier in Pipefitters,\nmade clear that the limitations on corporate and labor\nunion contributions in section 441b are not a, quote,\nabsolute prohibition, but rather just a limitation on\ncontributions. The availability of the segregated funds\nto make the contributions is another way of making this a\nlimitation, a particular limitation designed for the\nunique risks of artificial entities like corporations and\nlabor unions.\nAnd I think any effort to distinguish the\ndiscussion in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and its\ndistinguished -- distinctions between contributions and\nexpenditures on the grounds that a prohibition might be\ndifferent just doesn't work because both Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee\ninvolved this very provision, section 441b. So whatever\nthere might be in the case of an absolute prohibition on\nsomebody's right to make contributions, 441b either isn't\nthat or isn't that in -- in a constitutionally relevant\nway after this Court's decisions in Massachusetts Citizens\nfor Life and National Right to Work Committee.\nSome discussion was had about fine distinctions\nthat potentially could be drawn between the American\nAssociation of Retired Persons, National Right to Work\nCommittee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, and North\nCarolina Citizens Right to Life. The point of section\n441b in the contribution context is that Congress has not\nfound a need to draw those kind of fine distinctions.\nMCFL itself, of course, drew some of those\ndistinctions in the contribution context -- in the\nexpenditure context, rather, but drew a distinction\nbetween contributions in light of the inherently greater\nrisk of corruption from contributions.\nAnother suggestion was made that perhaps there\nis a seemingly less restrictive alternative. As with\nindependent expenditures made by nonprofit associations,\nperhaps contributions that are made to the association\nwith the purpose of them being used for contributions to\ncandidates could be disclosed.\nQUESTION: Have we actually held, Mr. Clement,\nthat in regulating contributions, the Government must find\nthe least restrictive means?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, and to the contrary. This\nCourt has not held that. It did not apply a least\nrestrictive alternative analysis in National Right to Work\nCommittee. In the California Medical Association case, a\nplurality of the Court, in fact, affirmatively held that\nthe least restrictive alternative was not required in the\ncontext of contributions. So I don't think there is that\nrequirement.\nBut I want to address the -- the supposed less\nrestrictive alternative precisely because I believe that\nless restrictive alternative is illusory because the\nsuggestion is that -- that individuals could say -- could\ndisclose when they give a contribution to a nonprofit\norganization for the purpose of a contribution. Well, if\nthat's going to have the effect of avoiding the\ncircumvention rationale, I wonder whether people are\nreally going to volunteer the information that the\ncontribution to the nonprofit is for that purpose.\nAnd additionally, even if that is a permissible\nway and would be enforceable in the real political world,\nthat really doesn't give you much of a different result\nthan what Congress has specifically provided for with the\nsegregated fund.\nAnd indeed, the segregated fund actually is\nresponsive to the kind of First Amendment associational\ninterests that underlie this Court's concerns in Buckley\nand even going back to NAACP against Button. The concern\nis that disclosure requirements imposed on organizations\ncould be a backhanded way to get at membership lists. The\nsegregated fund prevents that by keeping the membership\nlists and the organization itself separate from the\npolitical activity of the organization. Indeed, if\nCongress hadn't provided for segregated funds as a\nrequirement for all corporations, but simply made that\navailable, I would think that many nonprofit corporations\nwould avail themselves of that option precisely to avoid\nthe interference with associational interests as in cases\nlike NAACP against Button.\nThe last point I'd like to talk about is simply\nthis idea that again underlies much of respondents'\narguments that because there is no threat from\nexpenditures to these types of corporations, there is\ntherefore no threat to these type of corporations engaging\nin corporate contributions. If that analysis were applied\nacross the board, it would undermine the entirety of this\nCourt's campaign finance jurisprudence which is based on\nthe fundamental recognition that contributions involve\ngreater risks than expenditures, and -- and expenditures,\ntherefore, are largely unregulated because they are --\npresumably do not pose as great a risk as contributions.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like the\ncourt below reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\n"
