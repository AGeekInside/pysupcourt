        "content": "(10:58 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nBrown against Payton.\nMs. Cortina.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA N. CORTINA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CORTINA: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn this case, the Ninth Circuit violated AEDPA\nby reversing the California Supreme Court's decision\naffirming Payton's 1982 death sentence. The California\nSupreme Court applied the exact right case, namely Boyde\nv. California, in the very manner contemplated that -- by\nthat decision when assessing Payton's claim that his jury\nmisunderstood the court's instructions and, in particular,\nfactor (k) so as to unconstitutionally preclude\nconsideration of his mitigating evidence.\nThe California Supreme Court's application of\nBoyde is precisely the type of good faith application of\nFederal constitutional law to which AEDPA demands\ndeference. It is manifestly not objectively unreasonable,\nand this can be demonstrated in three aspects of the\ndecision.\nThe first is that the California Supreme Court\nrecognized Boyde's specific holding that factor (k)\nfacially comported with the Eighth Amendment.\nThe second is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought the holding was\nthat factor (k), standing alone, does -- does not raise a\n-- does -- does not, standing alone, raise a question of\nreasonable probability of -- of misunderstanding or\nmisapplication of the law. And that's not what they're\nclaiming here.\nThey're claiming here that there was something\nmuch more than (k) standing alone. As I understand it,\nthey're claiming that the difference between this and\nBoyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is\nthat the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that\nwas in fact wrong and -- and continued to do so even after\nthe court interrupted the argument and that the court\nnever gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous\nstatements of law that the prosecutor had made. So that's\n-- that's why they're -- they're saying this is not a\nBoyde situation.\nMS. CORTINA: Your Honor, Boyde has two specific\ncomponents to its decision, which is, first, what factor\n(k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that\nissue, which California did, in deciding the impact of the\nprosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k). So\nthat, first, you start from the premise, as the California\nSupreme Court did, in following Boyde, that factor (k)\nfacially directed for consideration of Payton's mitigating\nevidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no, no. The -- the\nmitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered\nwithout a -- (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence\nabout the -- the character of the individual prior to or\nat least up to the moment of the crime. So this is --\nthis is different kind of evidence, and I -- I mean, this\nis post-crime evidence. And -- and I don't see that --\nthat Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover\nthis at all. It might be a -- it would be a -- a closer\nquestion if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument\nand the judge's failure to correct it. But even -- even\nwithout those elements, there would be a serious question\nwhether Boyde covered this at all.\nMS. CORTINA: Your Honor, the -- respectfully I\ndisagree. I believe that the California Supreme Court\ncorrectly and -- and reasonably determined that Boyde's\nholding encompassed Payton's character mitigating --\nPayton's mitigating character evidence because the holding\nin Boyde -- or the issue directly presented by Boyde was\nwhether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances\nrelated to the crime or allowed for non-crime related\nmitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do we make of the Chief\nJustice's clear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde?\nThe prosecutor never suggested that background and\ncharacter evidence could not be considered. So mustn't we\ntake Boyde with that qualification when we have a case\nwhere the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this\ninformation could not be taken into consideration as a\nmitigating factor?\nMS. CORTINA: No, Justice Ginsburg. First, you\nmust assess factor (k) facially and that's what Boyde did.\nThen the next question is did the prosecutor's\nmisstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to\nbelieve that they could no longer consider Payton's\nmitigating character evidence. And that would be the\nsecond component of Boyde which is a general test for\nassessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood\nthe instructions in the context of the proceedings. And\nthe particularly relevant and important inquiry in this\ncase is the California Supreme Court's application of\nBoyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the\nproceedings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we take -- do we take\nthe case on the assumption that the trial court erred in\nnot giving a curative instruction and in saying, well,\nthis is a matter for the attorneys to argue? You -- you\ndon't argue about what a statute means. That's a question\nof law. You don't argue that. You can argue the facts,\nthat it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's\nextenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you\ncan interpret a lot of this. But it -- it seems to me\nthat the trial judge does make a mistake when he says,\nwell, well, this is for the -- this is for them to argue\nwhen the -- the point of the objection was that there was\na misinterpretation of the instruction. That's a legal\npoint.\nMS. CORTINA: And that is a fact that was\nexpressly considered by the California Supreme Court in\nappropriately applying Boyde's general test for whether\nthe jury misunderstood the court's instructions and an\ninstruction that facially called for consideration --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not that -- that the jury\nmisunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no\ninstruction. I mean, the -- the picture that's given here\nis the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate.\nThe prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating\nevidence, and he said that several times. And the judge\nsaid, well, you can both argue it, and the judge never\ninstructed the jury. He left it to the prosecutors to\nargue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that\nlegal determination. It -- it seems to me that that --\nthat is surely an error. Now, you could still say, well,\neven so, it was harmless. But -- but I don't think -- can\nthere be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you\nargue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the\nlaw is?\nMS. CORTINA: Yes. There -- there is a\nreasonable likelihood that the jury did not take the\nprosecutor's statements so as to preclude consideration of\nPayton's mitigating evidence because the prosecutor's\nstatements cannot --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, even -- even if -- even\nif that's argument is -- is on point, just taking your --\nyour response on its own terms, where do you get a\nreasonable likelihood?\nMS. CORTINA: Because the prosecutor's\nstatements cannot be construed in a vacuum. You have to\nlook, as Boyde required and as California did, at the\ncontext of the entire proceedings. What we're here --\nwhat the jury was doing in Payton was deciding whether\nPayton should live or die, the sentencing determination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but let's get specific.\nYou -- you said there isn't a reasonable possibility.\nWhy? Get -- get down to facts. Why isn't there a\nreasonable possibility?\nMS. CORTINA: Why there is not a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury misunderstood?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. The prosecutor stands\nthere and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and\nafter the judge interrupts him -- says, you cannot legally\nconsider this evidence. It does not fall within (k), and\nthe judge never corrects it. Why is there not a -- a\nreasonable likelihood of -- of jury mistake?\nMS. CORTINA: One, Your Honor, the judge\nadmonished the jury that the prosecutor's statements were\nthat of an advocate, and that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. Precisely, if I recall --\nand you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the\njudge said was that the prosecutor's statements were --\nwere not evidence. Of course, they're not evidence. The\nissue isn't whether they were evidence. They were\nstatements of the law. The judge didn't say anything\nabout whether they were correct or incorrect statements of\nthe law. It seems to me that the judge's response to the\nobjection was totally beside the point.\nMS. CORTINA: The -- nevertheless, the judge's\nresponse relegated the prosecutor's statements as to his\npersonal opinion as to that of a -- some -- as -- as -- of\n-- of -- to argument, which is a statement of an advocate.\nAnd the jury, from the time it was empanelled, guilt phase,\nand through the penalty phase, and at the concluding\ninstructions was repeatedly instructed that they would be\ngetting the instruction on the law from the court. And\nhere --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the court didn't give them\nan instruction on this contested point.\nMS. CORTINA: I respectfully disagree.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He didn't come out and say,\nyes, you can consider this under (k). He never said that.\nMS. CORTINA: No, but (k) says you can consider\nit under (k).\nJUSTICE SOUTER: (k) says you can consider\nevidence that -- that goes to the gravity of the crime. I\nwill be candid to say I think you're stretching things\nabout as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that --\nthat character evidence pre and up to the time of the crime\ncan be considered reasonably under that factor. But\ncertainly evidence of what an individual did after the\ncrime is committed does not naturally follow within (k) at\nall, and I don't know why any juror would consider it\nunless a judge came out and said flatly you can.\nMS. CORTINA: Your Honor, the California Supreme\nCourt reasonably applied Boyde's holding, that factor (k)\ndid call for consideration of character evidence, and\nthat's precisely what Payton presented --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what if we conclude\nthat there was an error here? Is there a harmless error\nargument that you fall back on?\nMS. CORTINA: Yes, Your Honor, there is a\nharmless error, but before we even get to harmless error,\nthe fact that you disagree with the ultimate conclusion of\nthe California Supreme Court under AEDPA is not\nsufficient.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMS. CORTINA: The California Supreme Court's\ndecision --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question that goes\nsort of to the beginning? What is your position on\nwhether or not the prosecutor correctly stated the law?\nMS. CORTINA: The State concedes, and as the\nCalifornia Supreme Court recognized, the prosecutor\nmisstated the law, but the jury would not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you also concede he did so\ndeliberately? Do you concede there was prosecutorial\nmisconduct is what I'm really asking.\nMS. CORTINA: Absolutely not, Your Honor. The\nprosecutor did not commit misconduct. The prosecutor made\na mistake, and the misconduct analysis, which is similar\nto what Boyde contemplated when they set forth the general\nstandard for assessing whether a jury would misunderstood\n-- misunderstand an instruction is -- is almost the same\nwhen -- when you're analyzing whether the question is\nprosecutorial misconduct. Boyde sets forth the test for\nhow to assess a misstatement by the prosecutor, and Boyde\nsaid that at the first instance, a statement of the\nprosecutor is not to be considered as having the same\nforce as instructions from the court. And that principle\nwas recognized by the California Supreme Court and\nreinforced --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That -- that statement went to\nwhether the jury was apt to accept it, not to the question\nof whether the prosecutor acted improperly.\nMS. CORTINA: I'm sorry, Your Honor. The -- in\nthis case, the prosecutor made a mistake. I don't think\nthat there's any evidence to support the conclusion that\nthe prosecutor committed misconduct in this case,\nparticularly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I can see that a --\na prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k)\nevidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of\nlittle weight. He did say at -- at one -- at one time,\nyou have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and\n-- and that -- that's the troublesome part.\nMS. CORTINA: Your Honor, the -- the State\nconcedes that the -- the prosecutor did make\nmisstatements, but I think that the bulk -- as you pointed\nout, the bulk of the prosecutor's argument went to the\nweight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence,\nand actually most of the argument by the prosecutor\nindicating that Payton's evidence didn't mitigate the\nseriousness of his rape and murder is -- there were\nsimilar arguments that were made by the prosecutor in Boyde\nand which Boyde found were not objectionable.\nBut again, the important scrutiny is that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court evaluated the prosecutor's\nstatements within the correct analytical framework matrix\nestablished by Boyde. They considered all the correct\nprinciples, the -- the effect of argument of counsel.\nThey considered the instructions, and like Boyde, they\nfound that factor (k) facially directed the\nconsideration --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose I were to\ntake the view that it is a violation of clearly\nestablished law for a court to allow a prosecutor\nrepeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about\nwhat the law is on a life or death question without\ncorrecting that misstatement, without saying to the jury,\njury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law\nis. I tell you what the law. If the judge doesn't do\nthat, then that meets any standard of violating clearly\nestablished law about which there should be no doubt that\nwhen the prosecutor makes a misstatement on a life or\ndeath question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury,\nhe is wrong. You take your instruction from me and here's\nmy instruction.\nSuppose that's my view of this case. I don't --\nBoyde and all these other cases -- it just strikes me that\nthat's clearly wrong. What do I do with that?\nMS. CORTINA: Well, you can find that the court\nwas wrong and not like what you did -- what the court did,\nbut the inquiry is whether the jury misunderstood the\ninstructions as a result of the court's conduct. And that\nrequires an analysis of the context of the proceedings,\nand that is precisely what the California Supreme Court\ndid. They --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, now you're getting to\nthe question I think that Justice O'Connor raised a few\nminutes ago about are you urging, yes, this is error, but\nit was harmless?\nMS. CORTINA: No, I am not agreeing that this\nwas error at all. I agree that the prosecutor made a\nmisstatement and that the California Supreme Court\nthoroughly and properly evaluated that statement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but just on that point,\nif the prosecutor makes a misstatement, doesn't the trial\njudge have an obligation to correct it if it's\nsignificant?\nMS. CORTINA: The -- in this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I wrong? Or am I wrong\nabout that? The judge just kind of watches the ship sail\nover the waterfall?\nMS. CORTINA: The -- I mean, the -- the trial\ncourt did correct it. It may not be the sufficient\ncorrection in this Court's eye, but the court did give an\nadmonition that relegated the prosecutor's statements to\nthat of the advocate and not to the instructions of the\ncourt.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what if the prosecutor\nhad said several times to the jury during the course of\nhis arguments that the burden of proof by the State is by\na preponderance, not beyond a reasonable doubt? And the\njudge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that,\nthey're not the law. I'll instruct you. But he never\nsays anything. Is that okay?\nMS. CORTINA: It's not what we'd optimally want\nthe court to do, but that's not the inquiry that's\npresented and answered by Boyde. The question is as a\nresult of what happened. Trials are not error-free. We\nwish that they were, but they're not. The question is how\ndo you respond to when a -- when a prosecutor makes a\nmisstatement of law. And Boyde addresses that question.\nBoyde --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, normally we would think\nthe trial judge would correct a misstatement of the law by\ncounsel. We would normally think that, wouldn't we?\nMS. CORTINA: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it wasn't clearly done\nhere. I mean, the -- the jury was reminded that arguments\nof counsel are just that. But there was no attempt to\ncorrect what appeared to be a misstatement.\nMS. CORTINA: The court's admonition was\nsufficient. But we're -- we -- we have to respond to the\ncase that's before you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what admonition was\nsufficient? The court said something about evidence and\neverybody -- I mean, there's no question what the\nprosecutor said isn't evidence. But he didn't tell them\nhe has misstated the law. We're not talking about --\nevidence is not at issue at all. Neither side suggests\nthat it is. It's a question is what is the law that\ngoverns this controversy, what is the law that the jury\nmust apply to make a life or death decision.\nMS. CORTINA: Right, and what was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and you --\nMS. CORTINA: Sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you said the judge\ncorrected it, and I read this joint appendix. I could not\nfind any correction.\nMS. CORTINA: The court's admonition that the\nprosecutor's argument was not evidence but argument of\ncounsel relegated the statements of the prosecutor to that\nof an advocate and did not take the prosecutor's arguments\nand elevate it in place of the instructions given --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- then it -- then it\nhas another problem with it because then the judge is\nsaying that's an argument. Jury, you've heard arguments\non both sides. You decide. But it isn't for the jury to\ndecide what the law is.\nMS. CORTINA: But the analysis is whether there\nwas a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood the\ncourt's instructions so as to preclude consideration of\nPayton's mitigating evidence, and that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the judge instruct the\njury that you are to consider all of the evidence which\nhas been received during any part of the trial?\nMS. CORTINA: Yes, Your Honor, and actually\nthat's one of the inquiries that Boyde required, is that\nyou look at the instruction itself, the other\ninstructions, and that's an inquiry the California Supreme\nCourt did, in fact, conduct. And that is, the jury was\npresented with -- with a instruction that said, you shall\nconsider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed, and\nnothing out of any of the factors (a) through (k) limited\nthe jury's consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence\nor precluded -- pardon me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, are you taking the\nposition that as a matter of California procedure, the\njury was entitled to consider matters that -- matter that\nwas not within (a) through (k)?\nMS. CORTINA: I think that the instructions\nencompass the jury considering something not specifically\nin (a) through (k) for purposes of mitigating evidence\nbecause the instructions say, you shall consider the\nevidence presented, and that was Payton's evidence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have the California courts\nsaid that?\nMS. CORTINA: That?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have the California courts\nsaid that (a) through (k) are -- is not intended to be\nexhaustive at the pre-Payton -- pardon me. Yes. Have\nthey said that pre-Payton?\nMS. CORTINA: I don't think that that issue has\nbeen presented and decided by the California Supreme Court\nspecifically --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I thought the case was\nbeing argued to us -- correct me if I'm wrong -- on -- on\nthe theory that this was factor (k) evidence.\nMS. CORTINA: It is our position that it -- it\ndoes fall within factor (k) evidence, but in deciding\nwhether the -- whether Payton's jury was\nunconstitutionally precluded from considering the\nevidence, you look to the -- all the instructions. And\nwhen you consider the direction to consider all -- that\nyou shall consider all the evidence and then the\nconcluding instruction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Ms. Cortina, the -- the\nred brief -- maybe it's not accurate. They say the\ninstruction was all the evidence received during any part\nof the trial in this case, except as you may hereafter be\ninstructed, and then that followed what -- the factor (k)\ndiscussion came after that. So would it not have been\npossible that the jury would have thought except for the\nfollowing things? Or is there something more that I\nmissed?\nMS. CORTINA: No. The written instruction\nfollowed the arguments of counsels. And what -- and so\nno, there was no instruction after that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if they misunderstood the\nfactor (k) instruction, they would have thought they could\nnot consider all the evidence.\nMS. CORTINA: There was no reasonable likelihood\nthat they felt that they could not consider Payton's\nevidence under factor (k), and the California Supreme\nCourt --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if they believed the\nprosecutor, they would have thought they couldn't.\nMS. CORTINA: But there -- but as analyzed by\nthe California Supreme Court, it is not reasonably likely\nthat the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first\nfew misstatements. And as I was saying, to do so, the\njury would have had to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But all -- all I'm directing\nmy inquiry to is to the significance of the instruction to\nconsider all the evidence. I think it's they could\nconsider all the evidence, except that which may not be\nadmissible, as I now -- or may not be relevant as I shall\nhereafter instruct you.\nMS. CORTINA: However, nothing in the following\ninstruction says you shall not consider Payton's\nmitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the prosecutor said\nthat if you interpret the last instruction properly, you\nshall not do so.\nMS. CORTINA: He said that it didn't fall within\nfactor (k). However, the -- the jury would -- there is no\nreasonable likelihood and the California Supreme Court was\nnot objectively unreasonable, including -- in concluding\nthat the -- that the jury would have accepted the\nprosecutor's first few misstatements and chosen to\ndisregard Payton's mitigating evidence because the jury\njust sat through eight witnesses testifying to Payton's\npost-crime remorse and rehabilitation. They sat through\nthat without any misstatements by the prosecutor. So they\nrecognized that they had heard this evidence and that it\nwas relevant and that it was subject to consideration.\nThen they heard the arguments of counsel\nconcerning the weight to be attributed to Payton's\nmitigating evidence. And although the prosecutor did make\nthe misstatements, his statements were relegated to that\nof an advocate. And to conclude that the jury would\ndisregard the repeated instructions to follow the -- to\ntake the law from the court and their inevitable, long-\nheld societal beliefs that remorse and rehabilitation are\nrelevant to making an appropriate moral reasoned response\nin deciding the life or death sentence is not a reasonable\nconclusion.\nAnd we know that the fact -- in fact, that the\njury did consider Payton's mitigating evidence by virtue\nof the questions that the juries -- the jury asked the\ncourt during deliberations. The jury asked whether Payton\nwould be eligible for parole and whether any change in the\nlaw could retroactively make him eligible for parole. You\nonly get to a consideration of whether -- what the effect\nis of saving Payton's life, under the California\nsentencing scheme that was -- existed at that time, if you\nbelieve that there's mitigation evidence to consider\nbecause California, at the time of Payton's sentencing,\ninstructed the jury that if the aggravating circumstances\noutweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose\ndeath. Their --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They -- they might not have\nthought that the aggravating circumstances were entitled\nto -- to great weight. I mean, we don't know how they\nevaluated the aggravating circumstances.\nMS. CORTINA: That might be one reasonable\nconclusion, but the other reasonable conclusion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean, that -- that is a\npossible conclusion, and therefore, it doesn't follow from\nthe fact that they raised the question about life without\nparole that they necessarily had found -- that they were\nnecessarily considering the mitigating evidence.\nMS. CORTINA: It's a reasonable inference to be\nmade from the questions asked, and that's what you're\nlooking at.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's -- it's one possibility.\nIsn't that all?\nMS. CORTINA: It's one reasonable inference, and\nthat's what's the important inquiry, is that the trial --\nthe California Supreme Court reasonably considered the\nrelevant, pertinent facts and all the applicable law in\nreaching a decision that Payton's jury was not\nunconstitutionally precluded from considering his\nmitigating character evidence. And I think that -- that\nthe California Supreme Court's decision demonstrates that\nit applied Boyde to the letter faithfully and\nmethodically, and that it -- it considered all the\nrelevant facts and that its decision under these\ncircumstances is manifestly not objectively unreasonable.\nAnd that is the requirement, and that is the inquiry that\nwe're here today to resolve.\nThe -- the Ninth Circuit failed to give the\nappropriate deference to the California Supreme Court's\ndecision in deciding that the penalty should be --\nPayton's penalty should be reversed. And the Ninth\nCircuit instead conflated objectively unreasonable with a\ndetermination that it personally felt that there was\nconstitutional error and doesn't respect the distinction\nrecognized in AEDPA between a incorrect decision -- or a\ncorrect decision, incorrect decision, unreasonable\ndecision, and the higher threshold of objectively\nunreasonable.\nAnd unless this Court has any further questions,\nJustice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of\nmy time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How long did the penalty phase\ntake?\nMS. CORTINA: The penalty phase took about a day\nwith eight witnesses.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Gits.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN R. GITS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GITS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nI'd like to start off, if I may, by addressing\nsome of the points that were brought up just earlier, and\nI'd like to indicate to this Court that the California\nSupreme Court has held that factors (a) through (k) are\nthe exclusive considerations that the jury must encompass\nin deciding whether or not to impose death or life.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Has factor (k) been\nsupplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?\nMR. GITS: It has. In 1983, 2 years after\nPayton's trial, it was supplemented to include all of the\nmitigating evidence that this Court has indicated the jury\nis entitled to consider.\nBut what is important --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. Do they still call\nit factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental\ninstruction that follows factor (k)?\nMR. GITS: It's been a couple of years since\nI've done a death penalty trial, but I think it's still\ncalled factor (k). It's just supplemented and changed\nthat way.\nThe second thing is that this Court has\nindicated some concern over the jury question that was\nraised first in -- in the State's reply argument. And I\nneed to put the Court, I think, in -- in proper context as\nto what occurred in -- in that jury question.\nThe case was given to the jury at 11:55 on the\ndate of -- of the determination, and the jury was told to\nselect a foreman. 5 minutes -- they went into the\ndeliberations room. 5 minutes later they came out and\nwent to lunch. They didn't commence their deliberations\nthereafter until 1 o'clock. At 1:10, they came out with a\n-- the question that is now before the Court. And I want\nto suggest to this Court that it is not reasonable to\nbelieve that during that 10-minute span of time the jury\nconsidered the -- whether or not factor (k) applied.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what was the question?\nMR. GITS: The question -- there were really two\nquestions. One -- and I'm paraphrasing -- is there any\npossibility Mr. Payton could be released on parole if we\ngive him life, and the second one is if the law is\namended, could that be construed to be retroactively\napplicable to Mr. Payton. Those were the two questions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those don't sound as if they\nthought his conversion to Christianity made a difference.\nMR. GITS: I think, Your Honor, what the jury\narticulated is what this Court has seen on many occasions,\nthe jury's concern about does life without possibility\nmean life without.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GITS: They never went beyond that at this\npoint in time. So what I'm suggesting to this Court is\nthat the short span that they had to write that question,\nwhich I agree, given enough time, might permit an\ninference that they did consider factor (k), isn't\napplicable in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, an equal inference is\nthey just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all\ngiven the horrific nature of this -- of this crime.\nMR. GITS: Yes, I agree. And my position isn't\nthat -- that the short span of -- you know, assists our\nposition. Our position is that this won't assist this\nCourt in arriving at a decision about whether the jury\nconsidered it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have to show there's a\nreasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an\nopposite conclusion.\nMR. GITS: Yes. And Boyde teaches that the way\nto do that is to look at the context of the entire case in\nconjunction with the -- the instruction that was given in\nthis case. And I want to start out that I -- I agree with\nthe State that the first thing this Court should do is\nlook at the instruction standing alone. And I want to\nindicate that without reference to the context of the\ncase, the instruction standing alone does not support the\ninference that Payton's post-crime evidence could be\nconsidered.\nNow, I agree that in the context of the case,\nthe context of the case could change that consideration.\nFor instance, if the court, as this -- some member of this\nCourt already indicated, told the jury that factor (k) is\nto encompass Payton's evidence, or even if the prosecutor\nmay have said to the jury during his argument, ladies and\ngentlemen, although it might not seem like Payton's\nevidence could be considered by you under factor (k), in\nfact it can, then we would be left with a situation very\nsimilar to Boyde where there really is no argument among\ncounsel as to whether or not the evidence could be\nsubsumed under (k). And that, in the context of that\ncase, would permit it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- on that point --\nand I -- I recognize it's -- it's not nearly as clean as\nthe hypothetical you present -- he did say -- this is the\nprosecutor. The law in its simplicity is that if the\naggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the\nsentence should be death, and so let's just line these up,\nand then he talks about the -- the conversion. So there\nwere other parts of his argument that indicated by one\ninterpretation this is not mitigating under special (k) --\nunder factor (k). But here he does say that you line that\nup and you weigh one against the other.\nMR. GITS: I -- I would respond to that by\nsaying two things. He does say that, but after he says,\nladies and gentlemen, I want to address some of -- of\nPayton's evidence. I'm not suggesting and I'm -- and I\ndon't believe that it applies under factor (k). But then\nhe went on to discuss that evidence. And I agree he did.\nI certainly can't say he didn't.\nBut -- but the real issue here is what effect\nlikely did that have on the jury, and I -- I'm indicating\nthat -- that given the preliminary -- his preliminary part\nabout it still doesn't apply but I will address it, that\nis unlikely to give the jury any confidence that that\nevidence could be considered. So it's not at all a\nconcession that occurred in this case whatsoever.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why wouldn't the jury\nconclude -- why isn't it the most logical conclusion that,\ngee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and\nlisten to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it,\nso of course we must consider it because otherwise we\nwouldn't have been exposed to all of it?\nMR. GITS: That was a relevant consideration in\nBoyde and I think a powerful consideration in Boyde and in\nCalifornia v. Brown. Because of the context of this case,\nit's not relevant here. Once the judge permits both\ncounsel -- one counsel to argue one way and the other\ncounsel to argue the other way, the jury is now being\nrelegated as the -- the finder of the law. In order to\nevaluate whether or not they could consider that evidence,\nthey had to look at the evidence that was presented.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they -- they always have\nto say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or\nis it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying,\nwell, this really isn't mitigating. And we know as\nlawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is -- that\nis relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it\nthe weight that it chooses. But jurors say, well, you\nknow, this -- this just is not important is what they're\nsaying.\nMR. GITS: Well, when the prosecutor says this\ndoesn't fall under (k) and the defense attorney says it\ndoes fall under (k), all I'm indicating is that the\nargument that this would be viewed as a charade no longer\nhas any effect. It is now a preliminary thing that the\ncourt -- that the jury must look to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a shorthand for\nsaying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so\nlittle weight. Now, that's I think how the jury might\nhave interpreted it.\nMR. GITS: Yes, Your Honor, they might. But the\nissue here is whether or not there's a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury did not consider that, and -- and\nthat's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually that isn't really the\nissue. I think -- I find that easy. The harder issue is\n-- is whether the -- a person who thought about it\ndifferently than me, a judge, would have -- be objectively\nunreasonable. At least for me, that's the hard question.\nThe question you're arguing is not hard.\nMR. GITS: Yes. I don't think I understand Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I would perhaps have\ncome to a different conclusion than California Supreme\nCourt on that question, but we can overturn them only if\nthey're objectively unreasonable. And that's -- that's\nthe hard thing because -- for me.\nMR. GITS: Yes. I -- there is very --\nrelatively little guidance that we have so far on the\nAEDPA. I think the -- the cases that do have some\nrelevance are both Wiggins v. Smith and Taylor v.\nWilliams. Wiggins v. Smith dealt with the failure of the\nState court to actually evaluate evidence that occurred in\nthis case.\nThe California Supreme Court opinion on the\nissue of whether or not the -- the court properly\nconducted itself has one sentence, and the sentence says\n-- and I'm paraphrasing -- something to the effect of the\nfact that the court refused to adorn factor (k) is not in\nitself a -- an error. Well, we all, I think, would --\nwould concur that that's true, but that doesn't address\nwhat happened here. It's a complete failure to address an\nall-encompassing event that happened, something close --\nand I have to be careful here -- something close to\nstructural error where the judge gives over the obligation\nto decide what the law is to the jury. The California\nSupreme Court not once ever considered that, and there is\nno reference to them doing anything other than making that\none --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, but I mean, that's --\nthat's really wrong what the judge did. But -- but the --\nthat -- that's tangential to the question. The question\nis, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that\nthe jury would have considered the evidence that he was\nconverted? But since it did occur, you know, they -- they\ndidn't consider it. Is it reasonably likely they never\nconsidered it? That's -- that's the question.\nAnd then I can imagine, for what reason that\nJustice Ginsburg said, myself sitting in the California\nSupreme Court and saying, well, they heard the evidence\nfor 2 days or a day, six witnesses, eight witnesses.\nThey're not technicians, the jury. And -- and of course,\nthey considered it. I can imagine that and that's why I'm\nhaving -- even though I don't agree with it.\nMR. GITS: Yes. Considered I agree. They\ncertainly considered the evidence, but they also, if they\nwere following their obligation under the law, they\nconsidered whether or not they were entitled to give that\nany weight under factor (k). That was the primary\nfunction that was given to them. So certainly they\ndiscussed the evidence, but then did they arrive -- did\nthey go in that room and arrive at a decision that maybe\nwe can't by law consider this evidence? And I think\nthat's the focal point here and that's the thing this\nCourt doesn't know what happened in that jury room.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Except if they heard so much\nof the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought\nthey couldn't consider what they heard?\nMR. GITS: The more evidence they hear, the more\nlikely it is I think that human beings are going to\nconsider the evidence.\nThe evidence -- the -- the penalty evidence took\nplace over a 2-day period of time, but I want to indicate\nthat it took place over two half-day periods of time, and\nthat if you put the time together, I think it comes to\naround 70 pages, which should be substantially less than a\nhalf-day altogether. Now, it encompassed eight witnesses,\nand there was a lot of evidence brought out about post-\ncrime conduct. But it -- it wasn't a massive amount such\nas there was in Boyde, 400 pages and weeks of testimony.\nSo I think that that's a -- a -- an important\nconsideration too.\nThe -- the Court's concern about whether or not\nthe jury would likely consider that, it seems to me,\nstarts with the -- an examination of -- of factor (k)\nitself. And -- and I want to indicate that Mr. Payton\nreally didn't start out at the same mark as -- as the\nState did in its case. The language of factor (k) just\ndoesn't on its face appear to permit consideration of that\nevidence. And -- and so, therefore, something had to have\nhappened in the trial, we assert, to change that, to make\nthe ambiguous, at least as applied to Payton, evidence of\nfactor (k) applicable so that the jury would reasonably\nlikely consider it.\nThe events that could have happened during the\ncontext of that trial didn't happen. In fact, everything\nhappened against the defendant. He starts off with an\ninstruction that's against him that supports, under any\nnatural reading, the prosecutor's language, and then he's\nbuttressed with a prosecutor that given the plain and\nnatural meaning of the language, is going to have a far\nmore compelling position with the jury about whether or\nnot it could be considered. And the -- and the defense\nattorney's position is really nothing more than an\nassertion, when he looks at the language itself -- an\nassertion that it was awkwardly worded.\nNow -- now, the defense attorney made reference\nto if this was the kind of evidence -- if I was a juror\nand I was considering this, I would think this would be\nimportant evidence. And the answer to that is of course,\nit is important evidence, but that's not the question.\nThe question is whether or not it could be considered\nunder (k). He gives -- he, the defense attorney, gives\nhis position that -- that (k) was meant to be a catchall\nfactor and it was meant to consume and take into effect\nPayton's evidence, but he had nothing to support that. He\nhad no legal position to support it. He was faced with\nthe plain language of the statute that didn't permit him\nto do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it? I mean, it -- it\nsays that -- what's -- what's the exact language of that\nstatute? I just had it here. It's -- it's gravity. It's\nthe --\nMR. GITS: It is any other circumstance which\nextenuates the gravity of the crime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of the crime. You could say\nit. Yes, his -- his later conversion extenuated the\ngravity of the crime, not the -- not the -- when I try to\nthink of this person, who is not me, thinking of that, I\nsay, well, plausible. Plausible, not perhaps the best,\nbut plausible, isn't it?\nMR. GITS: Well, as we pointed out in our brief,\nthis Court in -- in Skipper -- some Justices in -- in that\ndecision indicated that -- well, in fact, the majority\nindicated that the post-crime evidence of rehabilitation\nin prison is, in fact, not anything that relates to\nculpability. Factor (k), however way you look at it --\nand I agree that it's sufficiently ambiguous to where,\ngiven the right context, the right events happening at\ntrial, a jury would reasonably likely look at it as\ncovering that. But not under this case, though, because\nthere wasn't anything that happened in Payton's trial\nwhich permitted a reasonable inference that in fact that\nevidence should be considered.\nAnd as to harmless error, I -- as we pointed out\nin our brief, it -- under the California statute, which in\neffect requires that if the aggravating evidence outweighs\nthe mitigating evidence, the jury shall return a verdict\nof death, if there's no reasonable likelihood that the\njury considered factor (k), then in effect Bill Payton was\nleft without any mitigating evidence to be considered by\nthe jury at all. And that means that the jury had to come\nback with a verdict of death.\nNow, that brings this Court, once the Court --\nif the Court becomes satisfied as to constitutional error,\nthat brings the Court, I think, very closely to -- to this\ncase -- this Court's case in Penry v. Johnson because\nthere the jury will not have had a vehicle in order to\ngive effect to Payton's mitigating evidence.\nIn Penry v. Johnson, in fact, in discussing at\nleast the Eighth Amendment issue, this Court never really\neven discussed harmless error. It was reversed without\nany discussion. Now, I don't want to suggest the Court\ndidn't engage in a harmless error --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I see where you're going,\nand I -- I see that there's some parallel. The problem in\nPenry was that the jury -- the jurors had to actually\nviolate their instructions, and you have to escalate your\nargument a bit before you get to that point.\nMR. GITS: Yes, I -- I agree. It's not exactly\nidentical, but we're very close to -- to that point in\nPenry.\nBeyond that, the prosecutor did argue\nvociferously that the jury should -- in its determination,\nshould be concerned about whether or not Bill Payton is\ngoing to stab the prison guards in the back, in effect,\nargued dangerousness, which was appropriate. But if the\njury -- he also argued that the jury couldn't consider\nevidence which plainly pointed to his lack of\ndangerousness, his good adjustment in prison, his\nconversion to Christianity. So, in effect, the prosecutor\nwas able to argue its side and -- and the jury wasn't\nable, when you get to the harmless error analysis, to\nargue its side. And that's what makes this, it seems to\nme, a very strong showing that -- that harmless error --\nthat the error in this case is not harmless. It had a\nclearly important effect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it relevant at all? This\nhappened 24 years ago. We're sitting here trying to think\nof what a jury would have been thinking in a state of the\nlaw that's a quarter of a century old and facts -- I don't\nknow what to think. I guess that's just irrelevant?\nMR. GITS: Well, it's certainly relevant to Bill\nPayton, and -- and I don't demean the position of the\nCourt.\nIt's not relevant in terms of its impact as to\nfuture cases. There are some cases left that are still\ndealing -- out there, dealing with factor (k). The best\nour knowledge, we've -- we've done a search and we believe\nthere is about 70 cases dealing with the old, unadorned\nfactor (k), but of those 70 cases, none of them from --\nand we haven't reviewed all of them, but of the ones we've\nreviewed, none of them deal both with Payton's pure post-\ncrime evidence, coupled with the prosecutor's unrelenting\nposition to the Government that they cannot consider that\nevidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So all this was at a time\nbefore Penry was decided.\nMR. GITS: It is the time before Penry v.\nJohnson was decided.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GITS: It is not the time before Penry v.\nLynaugh was decided. And when I say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is the Texas -- the Texas\n-- you know, the ones --\nMR. GITS: Both are the Texas case. Both deal\nwith Mr. Penry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, one and two.\nMR. GITS: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that --\nMR. GITS: Yes. And when I say it was not\nbefore that, I'm talking about on the date of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court's decision. At the time of the\njury determination, this Court only had -- or that court\nonly had Lockett to make a determination as to whether the\nevidence could be -- could be considered. And the court\nmade the decision that he thought the -- it could be\nconsidered, but then refused to make any adjustments once\nit became clear that both counsel were going to argue\ntheir respective positions on the law.\nThe -- the Court earlier talked about other\ninstructions as impacting upon the -- the context of the\ncase, and those were important considerations in Boyde,\nespecially the observation that the jury was to consider\nany other evidence presented at either time in the trial.\nBut in the context of this case, Your Honor, it means\nnothing. As I've indicated, the jury was required to\nignore any evidence it heard at either phase of the trial\nunless it fit within factors (a) through (k). If it\ndidn't fit within there, even though they heard that\nevidence, they were instructed to ignore it.\nBeyond that, they were also instructed that the\n-- that they were to consider the arguments of counsel.\nNow, being that there was no clear instruction to the jury\nthat they had to consider factor (k) as being relevant\nevidence, the jury then likely put greater weight on\ncounsel's argument, and that's why it becomes important.\nSo the other instructions, when you put them all\ntogether, rather than putting in proper context what did\noccur in this case, in effect make it even harder for Bill\nPayton's position that the jury should consider factor (k)\nto be relevant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the prosecutor, at the\nvery end of his closing to the jury, did seem, even if\ngrudgingly with it, to recognize that -- that this\nevidence was mitigating. I'm looking at page 76 of the\njoint appendix at the top of the page. He makes the\nstatement, the law is simple. It says aggravating factors\noutweigh mitigating, and then how do those factors line\nup? Well, the facts of the case showing the violence, et\ncetera -- that's on the aggravating side. And then\nagainst that, defendant really has nothing except newborn\nChristianity and the fact that he's 28 years old. So that\n-- in that final word to the jury, the prosecutor seems to\nbe saying, yes, they have mitigating factors, but they're\ninsubstantial, 28 years old and the claim that he's a\nnewborn Christian.\nMR. GITS: It'll be up to this Court to make a\ndetermination as to where the prosecutor was going and\nwhether or not this constitutes a concession that -- that\nthe jury could consider the evidence. I -- our position\nis that viewed as a whole, he did not go to that.\nCertainly he permitted the jury, and he did address the\nissue of if the jury does consider that. He premised it\nby saying, I don't think this is relevant, but if -- and\nI'm paraphrasing here. But if you think it's relevant,\nit's still not entitled to weight.\nIf the issue before this Court is whether or not\nthere's a reasonable likelihood that the jury considered\nthat evidence, then given the context of that statement, I\ndon't think the jury can hardly be satisfied that the\nprosecutor in fact gave in and agreed that Payton's\nevidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do -- do we have a transcript\nof that hearing here?\nMR. GITS: Of what hearing, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the penalty phase. I\nmean --\nMR. GITS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- one way -- if I'm having\ntrouble, I'll just read it.\nMR. GITS: It is in the -- in the joint\nappendix, the entire --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The whole thing.\nMR. GITS: Yes, the entire penalty evidence and\nall argument and the instructions is in there.\nAnd that's -- unless the Court has any\nadditional questions, I have nothing further. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Gits.\nMs. Cortina, you have a little over 5 minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA N. CORTINA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CORTINA: Justice Stevens, the real inquiry\nis whether the California Supreme Court's decision was\nobjectively unreasonable. It is not whether there was a\nreasonable likelihood. And Payton, like the Ninth Circuit\n-- Payton's counsel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you help me on that? I\nthought it was two steps. I thought the question is\nwhether there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury was\nmisled, and then you have to ask whether it was\nunreasonable for the State supreme court to conclude that\nthere was that reasonable likelihood. Or correct me if\nI'm wrong.\nMS. CORTINA: That is one way of approaching the\ncase, but I think under AEDPA, what you'd look at, which\nwould be the more appropriate way, is how the California\nSupreme Court analyzed the claim and not first conduct a\nde novo review about whether there was a reasonable\nlikelihood. I don't think that in the end that there's\nmuch difference --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can't overturn it on\nhabeas unless there's a reasonable likelihood.\nMS. CORTINA: Right. That would be -- right.\nYou would have to find that the -- you would have to find\nan error and one that was objectively -- and then the\nCalifornia Supreme Court objectively unreasonable in not\nfinding the error. This is true. So obviously the\nreasonable likelihood test is a -- is a relevant inquiry,\nbut it is not the inquiry.\nAnd I think that -- that that's what Payton's\nargument demonstrates and the Ninth Circuit's analysis\ndemonstrates, is that they are effectively equating a\ndecision that the California Supreme Court's conclusion\nwas incorrect with their personal -- in their subjective\nopinion with a -- with the standard that the decision must\nbe objectively unreasonable. And in this case, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court's decision was manifesting not\nobjectively unreasonable.\nWe know -- we -- we know that objectively\nunreasonable doesn't have a clear definition. We do have\nan example of what is objectively unreasonable, and that\nwas cited in Payton's brief and that is a failure to\nconsider particular facts or relevant law. And we know\nthat that didn't occur in this case. The very argument\nand facts that Payton insists were not considered by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court in applying Boyde -- if not in\nthe majority opinion -- are found within Justice Kennard's\ndissent. So we have no question that the California\nSupreme Court identified the correct case and the correct\nprinciples within the case and considered all the\nnecessary facts. And that should make this decision\nsubject to deference under AEDPA.\nThis Court last term provided additional\nguidance on how to assess the range of reasonable judgment\nthrough the lens of AEDPA in Yarborough v. Alvarado. And\none of the things that the Ninth Circuit and Payton's\nanalysis keeps overlooking is the -- Boyde's specific\nholding concerning factor (k). And when you analyze the\n-- the range of reasonable judgment of the California\nSupreme Court concerning factor (k), the specific rule of\nfactor (k), the -- the range of reasonable judgment was\nless. The California Supreme Court had little to no\nleeway to conclude otherwise.\nBoyde's holding is broad. Boyde held that\nfactor (k) was a broad, catchall mitigation instruction\nthat allowed for any other circumstance that counseled a\nsentence less than death and specifically found that\nbackground and character fell within the ambit of factor\n(k). And no decision of this Court or the California\nSupreme Court in analyzing character has ever drawn a\ndistinction between post-crime and pre-crime character\nevidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's a footnote in Boyde\nthat seems to draw that distinction.\nMS. CORTINA: The footnote in Boyde actually\nsupports more California's position that factor (k)\nencompasses any other circumstance that would counsel a\nsentence less than death as opposed to the Ninth Circuit\nand Payton's interpretation that factor (k) is limited to\nthe crime.\nIn both the first part of footnote 5, the -- the\n-- Chief Justice Rehnquist rejects the dissent's argument\nthat the gravity of the crime focused the consideration to\nthe circumstances of the crime. Rather, it allowed the\njury to assess the seriousness of what the defendant has\ndone in light of what's the appropriate punishment, and\nthat involves a consideration of the defendant's\nbackground and character.\nAnd then the last part of footnote 5 expressly\nrecognizes that factor (k) allows for consideration of\ngood character evidence, and good character evidence is\nonly relevant to a decision about whether the person\nshould live or die, not to circumstances related to the\ncrime. And good character evidence under Payton and the\nNinth Circuit's interpretation of factor (k) would not and\ncould not, whether it existed pre or post-crime, fall\nunder the meaning of factor (k).\nSo the footnote 5 actually bolsters the ultimate\nbroad interpretation that the California Supreme Court\nadopted when it applied Boyde -- Boyde's specific holding\nconcerning factor (k) to the analysis of Payton's claim.\nAnd although they did, in footnote 5,\ndistinguish the fact that it did not involve post-crime\nevidence in mitigation, it didn't decide the question. It\nwas simply noting a fact that distinguished the case from\nSkipper. And -- and AEDPA requires that we follow the\nholdings of the Court and not dicta.\nSo when we start --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. -- go ahead and\nmake one more sentence.\nMS. CORTINA: The California Supreme Court's\ndecision was a reasonable application of Boyde and the\nNinth Circuit's reversal of it is -- and this Court\nshould --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think we understand you.\nMS. CORTINA: Exactly. Thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:53 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
