CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThrough the Controlled Substances Act, Congress\nhas comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs\nwith the potential for abuse. And with respect to\nSchedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a\nhigh potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical\nuse in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits\ninterstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully\ncontrolled confines of federally approved research\nprograms.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Clement, the -- I\nthink it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very\nbroadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on\nwhether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its\napplication in this context.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nO'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any\ndoubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled\nSubstances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because\nthe decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval,\ncases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases.\nAnd, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy\ndid so, as well.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but in Wickard, of\ncourse, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his\nwheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't\nhave that here. As I understand it, if California's law\napplies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use\nmarijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in\nthe area of something traditionally regulated by states.\nSo how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you\ndistinguish Lopez?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, let me\nfirst say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to\nthink that none of the marijuana that's produced\nconsistent with California law would be diverted into the\nnational market for marijuana. And, of course, the\nControlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every\nstep of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of\nlawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and\nfrom controlled substances under Schedule I into the\nnational market.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in looking at this\nbroad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of\nCalifornia will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out\nthat it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the\ninterstate market, that might be a different thing.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nO'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any\nreason to assume that California is going to have some\nsort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a\nfungible national drug market separate. And I think\nCongress, here, made important findings that you've\nalluded to, not just that there's a national market, not\njust that the intrastate and the interstate markets are\nlinked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because\ndrugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress'\nwords, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that\nhave traveled on interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, General Clement, what if\nwe were to assume -- I'm not saying this is -- that the\nDistrict Court could find that there is a narrow segment\nof the market in which they could prevent diversions, and\nthey had -- say they made such findings. Would we have to\ndisregard them, or say they were irrelevant?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think you would say they were\nirrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then why do you need to\nrely on the possibility of diversion?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, because I think it is a\nreality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question -- I\nthink that in -- obviously, in all of these commerce --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but in my hypothesis,\nit's a nonexistent reality.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in your hypothetical -- and\nif I could turn to that -- I still think the analysis\nwould not turn on whether or not the truth of the\nsupposition that diversion could be prevented, because\nthis Court, in a series of cases, including Darby,\nWickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the\nrelevant focal point for analysis is not the individual\nplaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial\neffect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of\nactivities that Congress has decided to regulate has such\na substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no\nquestion that the overall production, distribution, and\npossession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances\nhas a profound effect on interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not an interstate\ncommerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other\n-- in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to\nfoster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v.\nFilburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in\nmarijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the\nfact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate\ncommerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate\nit. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, no, it doesn't, Justice\nScalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I\nthink it's been clear, at least since the lottery case,\nthat Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce\nincludes the authority to prohibit items traveling in\ninterstate commerce and to declare something contraband in\ninterstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I would suggest that it is a\nperfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to\ntreat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just\nas contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband\nsimpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's quite a different\nrational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me\nyou're not -- you're not appealing to the fact that it has\na substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're\nappealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to\nprohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce\ncannot effectively be implemented without this law.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there's some truth\nto that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think\nwhat I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this\nCourt accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a\ndifferent regulatory regime. Here, Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're applying it to the\nopposite kind of regulatory -- you're applying it to a\nregulatory regime in which the government wants to\nprohibit this subject -- substance from being sold or --\nin interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter\n-- letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into\ninterstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand\nfor marijuana, because it would supply these local users\nand they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nStevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances\nAct, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that\nthere was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I\nsubstances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion\nmarket -- illegal market, albeit -- but market in\nmarijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But to the extent that this\nstatute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the\ninterstate market and confine these to locally grown\nmarijuana.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, first of all, Justice\nStevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion,\nto get back to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then I'm assuming -- my\nhypothetical is that California could pass a law that\nwould prevent diversions from occurring.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in the same way that the\nFederal Government has had trouble stamping out the\nmarijuana market entirely, I think California is going to\nhave parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But just --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose some -- one answer\nto that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.\nMR. CLEMENT: Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy.\nAnd, in that context, what this Court said is, even though\nit was focused on what was going to be an -- both in that\ncase and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did\nnot have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect\non interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the\nentire class of activities. And if I could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, as Justice O'Connor\nbrought out earlier, all those cases -- Wickard, Perez --\nthey all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here,\nwe're told this is different, because nobody is buying\nanything, nobody is selling anything.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nGinsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was\nto extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce\nto activity that the Court described as economic, but not\ncommercial. And I think the production and distribution\nand possession of marijuana is economic in the same way\nthat the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- no, I was going\nto -- your whole point, I take it, is that the two\nparticular patients in this case are simply -- simply\ncannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in\nthe fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think,\ngrowing it themselves or being given it. You're saying,\nyou cannot take that fact as a fact from which to\ngeneralize in deciding this case.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nSouter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this\nCourt's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz\nand Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in\nparticular, only because it, too, involves a non-\ncommercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I do take issue with\nthat. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a\nsmall farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the\ninterstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in\nturn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it\nhimself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard\ncan be distinguished on the facts.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, it could\nbe -- I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts,\nof course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in\nWickard, itself, recognized that the case was -- it was\nonly interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat\ninvolved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The other portion is a matter\nof [inaudible] interstate commerce.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, that's true, Justice\nO'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion,\nJustice Jackson, for the Court, put aside -- to one side\nall of the grain that was going to go in interstate\ncommerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents.\nThis case is only interesting, he said, because it\ninvolves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm.\nAnd he specifically talked about both the wheat that would\nbe fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be\nconsumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended\ndisposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the\nrecord of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that\nit wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding\nthe Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue\nthere. And it's important to recognize that the way the\nAgricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all\nthe wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it\napplied to the wheat that was used by the family for\nconsumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this\nCourt upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation.\nAnd so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of\nthe marijuana that's at issue and covered by the\nControlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state\nlaw, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not,\nis fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- authority.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- this a harder or easier\ncase than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was\nlawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to\nbuy and sell marijuana?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does this make your case\neasier, in a sense, or --\nMR. CLEMENT: I think it does, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause, as I said earlier, in responding to a question\nfrom Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a\ncontext where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit\nsomething in interstate commerce entirely, and has\nexercised that power, so it treats something as\neffectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then\ntakes the complementary step, especially in light of the\nfungibility of the product, and says, \"We're just going to\ntreat this as contraband simpliciter.\" I think that\njudgement by Congress has a very definite link to\ninterstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to\nregulate interstate commerce.\nAnd I do think there's a sense in which when\nCongress is regulating the price of something, there's\ncertainly a temptation to excise out relatively small\nproducers and for Congress to say, \"Well, we can still\nhave effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority\nof production.\" But with respect to something that's\nunlawful to have and is -- and has very significant risks\nprecisely because it's unlawful, any little island of\nlawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for\nexample, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime.\nIt would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal\nin promoting health. And I think the clearest example of\nthat is the fact that, to the extent there is anything\nbeneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has\nbeen isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been\navailable as a Schedule III substance, called --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- Marinol.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but there is, in this\nrecord, a showing that, for at least one of the two\nplaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of\nthem worked. This was the only one that would. And it --\nJustice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The\nlaw can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs.\nBut let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there\nwere to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this\ncase, would there be any defense, if there were to be a\nfederal prosecution?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we\nwould take the position, based on our reading of the\nOakland Cannabis case -- and, obviously, different\njustices on this Court read the opinion differently and\nhad different views on the extent to which the medical-\nnecessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion -- I\nwould imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it\ntook the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the\nfirst place, would be arguing that, on the authority of\nOakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not\navailable.\nBut I think, in any event, what is important, at\nthis point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have\nan affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled\nSubstances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in\nthat context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this\nCourt's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider\nonly the individual's conduct, but the entire class of\nactivities that's at issue.\nI think, in this regard, it's also worth\nemphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's\nargument, that California law is somehow relevant here or\nthe fact that their conduct is lawful under California\nlaw, is that there's a mismatch between what California\nlaw makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for\narguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate\ncommerce. Because the California law makes the possession\nof marijuana for medical use lawful under state law,\nwithout regard to whether that marijuana has been involved\nin a cash transaction or has crossed state lines.\nAnd so, if Respondents are right on their\nCommerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right\nbecause their conduct is lawful under state law or because\ntheir -- that marijuana use is medical. If they're right,\nthen I think their analysis would extend to recreational\nuse of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and\nwould extend to every state in the nation, not just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I think --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- those states that made it\nlawful.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it depend on how you\ndefine the \"relevant class of activities\"? Is it the\nentire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a\nnarrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the\nstatute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular\nvery narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible\nto define the class narrowly to escape a -- the broad\nargument that you make?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think that is\npermissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this\nCourt's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that this\nstatute could never have an unconstitutional application.\nMR. CLEMENT: Under the Commerce Clause, I --\nthat's exactly right, that would be our position. It is\nconstitutional on its face, and it -- and because of that\nline of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought,\nbut the legal test that's applied in the as-applied\nchallenge is one that considers the constitutionality of\nthe statute as a whole --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But, in Morrison, did the\nCourt's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify\nCommerce Cause -- Clause legislation by using a long but-\nfor causal chain from the activity in question to an\nimpact on interstate commerce? I mean, the Court\ncertainly made that statement.\nMR. CLEMENT: Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor,\nbut --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Which cuts against what\nyou're saying.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, I don't think\nso. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in\nMorrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize --\nthought it very important to emphasize two things:\none, that the activity there was non-economic in a way\nthat differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second,\nthe Court also made it clear that the regulation that\nthere -- there was not essential to the effectiveness of\nan overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both\npoints, this case is on the constitutional side of the\nline that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The argument on the other\nside is that this limited exception is a non-economic use\n-- growing for personal use, under prescription --\nMR. CLEMENT: I understand that -- I understand\nthat's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't\nunderstand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that\nWickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is\nnot also covered. You're talking about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Involved economic activity.\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic\nactivity. Because what you're talking about here is the\npossession, the manufacture, the distribution of a\nvaluable commodity for which there is a ready --\nunfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we rule for the Respondents\nin this case, do you think the street price of marijuana\nwould go up or down in California?\nMR. CLEMENT: I would be speculating, Justice\nKennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think\nthat what -- and that, in a sense, is consistent with the\ngovernment's position, which is to say, when the\ngovernment thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to\nprohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is\ngoing to lead to a black market, where the prohibition\nactually would force the price up. And there is a sense\nin which this regulation, although not primarily designed\nas a price regulation -- the Controlled Substance Act, I\nthink, does have the effect of increasing the price for\nmarijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the\n-- and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's\nall consistent with Congress' judgement here.\nAnd if I could return for a second to the point\nabout Marinol, what's important there is that the process\nof manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful\ncomponent, does two things. One, the manufacturing\nprocess allows there to be a safe use for one of the\ncomponents in marijuana. But it also provides an\nunambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce\nClause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to\nget people to use more healthful substances, and not use\nthings like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is\nundermined if Congress can't also address that which is\nmore harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable\nof being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude\nmarijuana is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, the statute is\n-- it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians\nwho prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, in responding to\nthat, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for\npurposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is\nsomething of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government\ntreats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding\nthat, some doctors may make a different judgement about a\nparticular patient; but that's something that this Court,\nI think, has previously understood, that the federal\nregulatory regime does not allow individual patients or\ndoctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's the import of the\nRutherford decision with Laetrile.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there could be\nany state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could\ndisagree with the finding of Congress that there's no\nacceptable medical use? Say they had a -- say there was a\njudicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding.\nWould we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the\ncongressional finding or the judicial finding if that\nhappened?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, it depends on the exact\nhypothetical you have in mind. I think the -- the\njudicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and\nthis Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a\nfinding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case\nwhere there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that\nthe underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule\nis invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go\nafter the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance\nwithout a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a\nsituation in -- and your hypothetical might respond to a\ndifferent statute that raised a harder question, where\nCongress made such a medical finding, and then just left\nit there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for\nchanging realities. But, here, Congress made it clear\nthat a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a\nway that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III.\nAnd I think it's wrong to assume that there's\nany inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I\nmean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from\nSchedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect\nof making it easier to prescribe and more available. But\nI think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try\nto counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for\ndiversion, with these other considerations of getting safe\nmedicine --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- available to patients --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- have there been any\napplications to change the schedule for marijuana to the\nFDA?\nMR. CLEMENT: There have been a number of those\npetitions that have been filed. There was one recently\nrejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999.\nThere was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-\niteration effort to change the rescheduling that\nculminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s.\nSo there's definitely been these efforts. But on the\ncurrent state of the -- of the record, there just is not a\njustification for changing the schedule.\nAnd I think both of the briefs talked a little\nbit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the\nmedical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing\nthat's important to keep in mind that that study comes to\na conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for\nthe individual components in marijuana, that smoked --\nsmoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as\nmedicine, because -- and that's true, I think, for two\nreasons. One, there's something like 400 different\nchemical components in crude marijuana that one would\nsmoke, and it's -- it just, sort of, belies any logic that\nall 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the\nprocess of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude\nmaterial that somebody could grow in their garden, and\nactually have people who do this for a living get involved\nin a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial\ncomponents, and then manufacturing and making that\navailable.\nThe second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't\nhave much of a future as medicine is, as I think people\nunderstand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of\ntobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea\nthat smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery\ndevice for medicine, I think, is also something that\nreally doesn't have any future as medicine.\nWhat does have a future for medicine, of course,\nis an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial\ncomponent. That's been done with Marinol. It is true\nthat some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form\nthat Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing\nresearch to try to figure out different ways to deliver\nthat substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of\na -- and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five\npages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that\nthere's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the\ndownsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it\ntakes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also\none of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that\nMarinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer\nto get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the\ncharacteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused,\nwhich is a very quick delivery time between the taking of\nthe substance and the time that it has an effect on the\nsystem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to your point a\nfew minutes ago about -- it was, sort of, a categoric\npoint -- you, in effect, said, \"If this argument succeeds\nwith respect to medical use of marijuana, the next\nargument is going to be recreational use, and there's no\nreal way to distinguish between them.\" Wouldn't this be a\nway to distinguish between them? That in deciding what\nclass you are going to -- or what subclass you're going to\nconsider from which to generalize, you simply ask the\nquestion, \"What good reasons are there to define a\nsubclass this way?\"\nIn this particular case, the good reasons to\ndefine a subclass of medical usage are the benefits --\nwhether you accept the evidence is another thing -- but\nthe benefits which the doctors say that, under present\ncircumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to\ntaking the synthesized drug.\nThere's no such argument, I would guess, in\nfavor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate\ncategory. And, for that reason, isn't there a -- isn't\nthere a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the\nRespondents are doing here, just medical usage, without\nany risk of generalizing to recreational usage?\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter, I\ndon't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to\nget on a path of starting to second-guess Congress'\njudgement about defining a class of activities --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may -- oh, that may be,\nbut it seems to me that that's a separate argument,\nbecause you're -- you were arguing before that if you\nrecognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing\nthe line against private recreational usage. And I'm\nsuggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that\nline, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you\naccept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to\ncategorize recreational usage separately, and that seems\nto me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-\nCongress argument.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I have no\ndoubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would\nfind it very difficult to police that line over the broad\nvariety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as\nfrustrating as policing the line in Hammer against\nDagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby.\nWith that, I'd like to reserve my time for\nrebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Barnett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDY E. BARNETT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. BARNETT: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI have two points to make. First, the class of\nactivities involved in this case are non-economic and\nwholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of\nthis class of activities it not essential -- is not an\nessential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be\nundercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\nIf you accept the government's contrary\ncontentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v.\nRaich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-\nreaching example of Commerce Clause authority over\nintrastate activity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on your first point,\ncan't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous\nmarket, commercial market, for any given commodity, that\nsimple possession of that commodity is a form of\nparticipation in the market?\nMR. BARNETT: It can be, or it might not be. If\nyou possess an item that came from the market or is going\nto the market, simple possession could easily be a part of\nthe marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item\nthat you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the\nmarket -- it didn't come from the market and it's not\ngoing to the market --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's fungible.\nMR. BARNETT: That -- the fungibility issue is\nin this case, but the -- but a -- the fact that a good is\nfungible does not make it a market good, and it does not\nmake the possession of that good an economic activity. Or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, Congress has\napplied this theory in other contexts. One is the\nprotection of endangered species. Congress has made it\nunlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter\nwhether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers,\nthe mere possession of it, whether you got it through\ninterstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is,\n\"We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce\nor not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our\nability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it,\nperiod.\"\nNow, are those -- are those laws, likewise,\nunconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce\npower?\nMR. BARNETT: Not if they're an essential part\nof a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut,\nunless those activities are reached.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why is that different\nfrom this?\nMR. BARNETT: Because this class of activities\n-- because it's been isolated by the State of California,\nand is policed by the State of California, so that it's\nentirely separated from the market --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isolated and -- I understand\nthat there are some communes that grow marijuana for the\nmedical use of all of the members of the communes.\nMR. BARNETT: That class of activities is not\nbefore the Court. That is actually before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's before the Court\nwhen you -- when you raise the policing of the problem by\nCalifornia, and saying it's not a -- it's not a real\nproblem, you brought it before the Court.\nMR. BARNETT: But that class of activities could\nbe -- could be -- if this Court limits its ruling to the\nclass of activities that is before the Court, that class\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is -- which is what?\nMR. BARNETT: Which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: An individual grower?\nMR. BARNETT: An individual who is growing it\nfor her -- him- or herself, who has -- or has a caregiver\ngrowing it for her --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, what basis --\nMR. BARNETT: -- for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what basis is there to draw\nit that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we -- we could say\npeople whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that\nwould narrow the category, too. But why does -- why does\nthat make any sense?\nMR. BARNETT: Justice Scalia, we believe it\nmakes sense because we are talking about a classification\nof activities that has been identified by the State of\nCalifornia, and which is rational to distinguish from --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but California hasn't\nidentified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far\nas California law is concerned.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, it's not entirely clear\nwhether communes are okay, as far as the California laws\nare concerned.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it be?\nMR. BARNETT: Because if, in fact, commercial\nactivity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking\nplace --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, they're not buying and\nselling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and\nselling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with\nalleged medical needs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't understand. Is\nthere any authority in the commerce cases for -- an X,\nwhich is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't\nmove one way or the other -- now, Congress' power does\nextend to the X if the state doesn't say something about\nthe X. But if the state says something about the X, then\nCongress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me\nto accept, because I don't see -- whether it's commerce or\nnot commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't\naffect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do\nwith whether the state separately regulates it, and I\ncan't find any support at all for that in any case.\nMR. BARNETT: The support would come from the\nexception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is\nurging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach\nnon-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly\nintrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger\nregulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't\nreach it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here, they say -- look, I\ntake it you're using this because I was going to ask you.\nYou know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are\ngoing to have genomes in them that could, at some point,\nlead to tomato children that will eventually affect\nBoston. You know, we can -- oil that's never, in fact,\nbeing used, but we want an inventory of it, federally.\nYou know, I can multiply the examples --\nMR. BARNETT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and you can, too. So you're\ngoing to get around all those examples by saying what?\nMR. BARNETT: By saying that it's all going to\ndepend on the regulatory scheme, what the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. BARNETT: -- purpose of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So now what you're saying is,\nin a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to\nstart to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme\nand see, comparing the federal scheme and the state\nscheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal\nscheme is really necessary to include this. That's a\ntask, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in\nmy question.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I see it very well. Here\nis what they say. They say that, \"By the way, a hundred-\nthousand people using medical marijuana in California will\nlead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And,\nsecond, when we see medical marijuana in California, we\nwon't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is\nmedical.' Certificates will circulate on the black\nmarket. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does\nhave an impact,\" they say. Now, what's your response?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, you've raised at least two\ndifferent practical issues. One is the fact -- the number\nof people who are in the class, and the second is the\nability to identify whether they properly belong in the\nclass.\nAs for the number of people, we are talking\nabout a very small number of people. They say a hundred-\nthousand. They get their figures from the National\nOrganization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures\nin our brief come from the government. The figures show\nit's a very small fraction of persons that would be\ninvolved. And their argument is basically -- and the\nlogic of your hypothetical is premised on -- the more\npeople that go into the illicit market, the better for\nfederal drug policy, because that will drive the price up.\nYou have to -- what we're take -- we're doing is, we're\ntaking people out of the illicit drug market, which then,\nunder your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction -- and\nJustice Kennedy's suggestion -- would lead to a reduction\nin the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite\nwould be, they're -- it's good for federal policy to have\nmore people in the illicit drug market, because that's\ngoing to drive the price up.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, we don't want more\npeople --\nMR. BARNETT: Of course not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in the illicit drug market.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BARNETT: Of course not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And we don't want low prices,\neither.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BARNETT: But the -- but the -- but the\nscheme of -- but the class of activities that have been\nauthorized by the State of California will take people out\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, normally I would have said,\nit's up to Congress to figure out how to -- the way that\n-- you have one going one way, one going the other way,\nand balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's\nwhat we'd normally say.\nMR. BARNETT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you say all that stuff is\nnot for Congress; that's for us.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, within this exception -- the\nthreshold issue -- I do want to make sure that I focus on\nthis -- the threshold issue, which is the issue that has\noccupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity\nhere is economic or non-economic. The government claims\nit's economic, we claim it's non-economic.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it is, is, it's non-\neconomic, and it affects the economic.\nMR. BARNETT: Right. So the threshold issue\nthat is -- that -- upon which Lopez and Morrison terms --\nturns is whether it's economic or non-economic.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I should have thought\nthat regular household chores of -- say, performed in an\nearlier time mostly by women, was classically economic --\nwashing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing\nmarijuana isn't?\nMR. BARNETT: If you accept the government's\ndefinition of economic, then every -- then washing dishes,\ntoday, would be economic, and that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but even --\nMR. BARNETT: -- would be within the -- within\nthe power of Congress to reach.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But even if we accept your\ndefinition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis\nupon which we ought to make a category decision. You say\nit's non-economic because one of these people is a -- is a\nself-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for\nnothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given,\nor any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe\nthat, out of -- now I'm going to assume, for the sake of\nargument, a hundred-thousand potential users -- everybody\nis going to get it from a friend or from plants in the\nbackyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're\ngoing to get it on the street. And once they get it,\nunder California law, it's not a crime for them to have it\nand use it. But they're going to get it in the street.\nWhy isn't that the sensible assumption?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, they have an -- they have a\nvery strong incentive not to get it on the street, because\ngetting it on the street is going to subject them to\ncriminal prosecution, under both California and federal\nlaw, as well as the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but the -- it's also the\ncase that approximately 10 percent of the American\npopulation is doing that every day, if I accept the\nfigures in the government's brief, and they're not getting\nprosecuted.\nMR. BARNETT: But we're talking -- in that case,\nwe're talking about people who are using it for sport, for\nrecreation. We are talking about a class of people here\nwho are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate\nthe law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if I am a sick person, I'm\ngoing to say, \"Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid\nwho buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small\nquantity today, they're not going to prosecute me,\neither.\" I mean, there's not going to be any incentive,\nit seems to me, to avoid the street market.\nMR. BARNETT: The government, in their brief,\nasserts that the -- that the possession statute that\ncurrently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why\nthey -- which is their explanation for why they failed to\nenforce the possession statute that they say is so\nessential to the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If one --\nMR. BARNETT: -- regulatory scheme.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if one takes your view,\nthat this is non-economic activity, so it's outside\nCongress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you\nhave someone similarly situated in a neighboring state,\nsomebody whose doctor says, \"This person needs marijuana\nto live,\" but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use\nAct -- it's just as isolated -- no purchase, no sale,\ngrown at home, good friend grows it -- and yet you say\nCongress could regulate that, if I understand your brief\nproperly.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor,\nbecause there's the -- that's the second step of the\nanalysis. The first step of the analysis is the\neconomic/non-economic. If you don't -- if the Court stops\nthere, then they could also apply in these other states.\nBut then if the Court adopts --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you -- if you buy that\n-- so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument,\nit would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate\nmedical use anywhere.\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: All right. Now you're going\nto have some limiting --\nMR. BARNETT: But a limiting principle is the\none that I -- was identified by the Court in Lopez in\nwhich the government is asserting that if it's an\nessential part of a broader regulation of economic\nactivity to reach this activity, then it may be reached.\nAnd the difference between states in which there is a\nstate law enforcement that's confining the class, and that\nthere is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use,\nis completely different from a practical enforcement\nstandpoint than a state in which there is no\ndifferentiation. Just think of the existence, for\nexample, of identification cards, which the State of\nCalifornia is going to be issuing, like driver's license\ncards.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yeah, but it doesn't right\nnow, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your\nview.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, because -- but this is the\nsort of regulation -- the sort of effectiveness of the\nregulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact --\nI believe the Court should be in the position of trusting\nthe State of California to be able to administer its\nregime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and,\ntherefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that\nactivity, and a lot of other activity in states in which\nthe states are not attempting to pursue the health of\ntheir citizens -- the goal of preserving the health of\ntheir citizens this way, that would fall under the\nexception which this Court suggested in Lopez --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is a new framework, I\ntake it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things\nthat interests me -- I guess, on your framework, Lopez\nshould have come out my way.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BARNETT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's essential to regulate\nguns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory\nscheme.\nMR. BARNETT: Justice Breyer, that's the reason\nwhy that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it\ndoesn't reach your result.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BARNETT: If that exception were treated as\nbroadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent\nin Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will\nswallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited\nto their facts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought we didn't need\nto reach all that here, for the reason that the connection\nhere, which is an enforcement-related connection and a\nmarket-related connection, is actually, I have to confess,\na little more obvious and a little more close than what I\nhad to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the\nconnection between guns, education, communities, and\nbusiness. So I would have thought, given the -- and I\nbelieve that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far\nfurther than this, which is just direct.\nMR. BARNETT: But this case is completely unlike\nthose cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez,\nthat gun probably did come through interstate commerce,\nnot that I believe it should have made any difference, but\nit probably did. Here, we're talking about substances\nthat don't. So there's just no literal connection between\nthis class of activities and this interstate market.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't decide that, in\nLopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in\ninterstate commerce. If the statute in question had\napplied only to guns that had been transported in\ninterstate commerce, the case might have come out\ndifferently.\nMR. BARNETT: I -- no doubt, Your -- I -- and I\nwasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just\nsuggesting that, here, we have -- exactly, that if there\nhad been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case\nmight have come out different. There is no interstate\nconnection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The\nonly way to make it an interstate connection is through\nsome sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in\nwhich somebody who's doing something over here is going to\nhave an affect on somebody else who's doing something over\nthere. There is no connection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sounds like Wickard to me.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, Wickard, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I always used to laugh at\nWickard, but that's -- that's what Wickard said.\nMR. BARNETT: Wickard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Had he not eaten the wheat, it\nwould have been in interstate commerce.\nMR. BARNETT: Had that case been about eating\nwheat, that case would never have arisen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what it was about,\nas far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure,\nthere were a lot of -- there was a lot more use of the\nwheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but\nit seems to me the analysis of the case said, \"You take it\n-- you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it\nyourself, you make it unnecessary for your -- to buy it in\ninterstate commerce.\"\nMR. BARNETT: It's -- the entire analysis -- the\nentire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was\nproof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the\nfarms. And by \"home-consumed,\" it did not mean eating at\nthe family -- at the family table; it meant feeding to\nyour livestock and then putting it -- your livestock --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Strange phrase, to mean\n\"feeding to livestock\"?\nMR. BARNETT: But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Home-consumed\" is feed it to\nyour pig?\nMR. BARNETT: But, yes, that's exactly what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so.\nMR. BARNETT: -- that's exactly what that\ngeneral term -- how that general term was used in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what the Court said, I take\nit -- and I have quoted a lot of the language there -- it\nsays that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown\nwheat, not the part that went in -- quote, \"though it may\nnot be regarded as commerce\" --\nMR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- end quote, still can be\nregulated, quote, \"whatever its nature,\" so long as,\nquote, \"it exerts a substantial economic effect on\ninterstate commerce.\" Now, that's the language, and I\ntake it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought,\nfrom that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown\nwheat, which is not economic, having an effect on\nsomething that is.\nMR. BARNETT: With all respect --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is not commerce. Sorry,\nnot commerce.\nMR. BARNETT: With all respect, what -- that's\n-- I was about to make that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the Commerce Clause\nspeaks in terms of commerce.\nMR. BARNETT: Right. Right. What the Court was\nusing here was the narrower -- the traditional definition\nof \"commerce\" that Justice Thomas has been urging this\nCourt to adopt. And they were saying that, \"We are not\ngoing to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of\n'commerce.'\" It would include, for example, agriculture\nand production. That's all going to be reachable, even\nthough it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But\nwhat we would call it today, and I believe what the Court\ncorrectly called it, in Lopez, was \"economic activity.\"\nProduction is economic activity. Manufacturing is\neconomic activity. But -- it's not commerce, but it's\neconomic activity that can be reached. And that is the\nactivity -- that's not only the activity that Farmer\nFilburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the\nstatute was aimed at. The statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why is this not economic\nactivity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This\nmarijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was\ngrown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't\nhave to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic\nactivity.\nMR. BARNETT: What made it an economic activity\nin Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial\nenterprise, that it was being used on the farm -- not in\ninterstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise\nof the farm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Again, I don't think that's --\nthat faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think\nthe opinion covered -- including the amount that he\nconsumed himself, and his family consumed.\nMR. BARNETT: The -- look, I -- for whatever\nit's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute\nexempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard\ngardens weren't even included within the regulatory\nregime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or\nstopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into\nthe market, or that could have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the opinion make a point of\nthat?\nMR. BARNETT: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the opinion make a point of\nthat?\nMR. BARNETT: It -- it was mentioned in the\nopinion. It was not -- it was not a major point of this\nopinion. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it was a point of\nthe Court's analysis at all.\nMR. BARNETT: This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- could I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask this question.\nWhat is your view with respect to the impact of the\nactivities concerned in this case on the interstate market\nfor marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no\nimpact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or\ndecrease the interstate demand? So there are three\nalternatives. Which is the one we should follow?\nMR. BARNETT: Can I pick \"trivial impact\"?\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if it -- \"trivial\nimpact,\" is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of\nmarijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your\nview?\nMR. BARNETT: The only effect it could have on\nthe price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has\nany effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users\nfrom the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they\nare now in the illicit drug market -- and we don't know\nwhether they are or not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that would reduce demand\nand increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way\naround.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, it would reduce demand and\nreduce prices, I think. But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you reduce demand, you\nreduce prices? Are you sure?\nMR. BARNETT: Yes.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, you're right. You're\nright. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your whole argument for\ntriviality, though, goes -- your whole argument for\ntriviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with\nthe government about how many people are involved, because\nI take it you accept the assumption that the more people\nwho are involved -- if there are millions and millions, it\nis unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be\nwithout an effect on the market. So the whole argument\nboils down to how many people are going to be involved.\nYou don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure.\nLet me ask you a question that would -- that would get to,\nmaybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how\nmany people there are in California who are undergoing\nchemotherapy at any given time?\nMR. BARNETT: I do not know the answer to that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that number going to be\nindicative of the demand for marijuana?\nMR. BARNETT: It could be, Your Honor, but that\nalso illustrates --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you -- if you accept\nthat, then there's nothing implausible about the\ngovernment's hundred-thousand number, is there?\nMR. BARNETT: But whatever -- I don't know,\nbecause I don't know the number of people using\nchemotherapy. But whatever the number --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How many people are there in\nCalifornia? What's the population?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thirty-four million.\nMR. BARNETT: Thank you, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Lots -- lots --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- lots and lots. They -- a\nhundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy\ndoes not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact,\nif that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility\nreflects, among other things, the fact that there is a\ncontroversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is\nenforceable, or not. And the reason -- there is reason to\nassume that -- if we ruled your way, that that number\nwould go up.\nSo, if you accept that line of argument, then\nyour argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is\ngoing to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I\nmissing something?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, two things. First of all,\nwhatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people\nwho are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is\nnot an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example,\nrecreational activity is, where lots of people could just\ndecide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify,\non a physician's recommendation, for this particular\nactivity. That will limit the number.\nBut the amount of the people -- the effect on\ncommerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn\naggregation principle applies to the class of activities\nin this case, and it does not apply to the class of\nactivities in this case if they are non-economic, as we\nassert that they are.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- but that is circular\nreasoning, because the whole -- your whole argument that\nit's non-economic is based on the claim that there are --\nthe numbers are so few -- the number of people involved,\nfrom what you could generalize, are so few that it would\nnot be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If\nthere would be a large market effect, it makes no more\nsense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-\neconomic.\nMR. BARNETT: Lopez and Morrison stand for the\nproposition that activities that simply have an effect on\nthe market are not necessary -- that does not make them\neconomic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just\nbecause an activity has an effect -- an economic effect\nmakes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a\nprinciple that's less than --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Remote, remote, remote economic\neffect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was inference upon inference\nupon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.\nMR. BARNETT: But just -- just have it -- just\n-- whether an activity is economic, you have to look to\nthe activity, itself, and an economic activity is one\nthat's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the\nproduction of things for sale and exchange, barter. This\nwhole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been\npremised on the ability to tell the difference between\neconomic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty,\non the other.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your whole jurisprudence\nin this case is premised on the assumption that we have got\nto identify the entire range of potential effect based on\nthe particular character of two individuals in their -- in\ntheir supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this\nargument is that that does not seem to be a realistic\npremise on which to base constitutional law.\nMR. BARNETT: The premise of our -- the premise\nof our economic claim is the nature of the activity\ninvolved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of\nactivity it is. The idea -- for example, you --\nprostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations\nis not an economic activity. We could be talking about\nvirtually the same act. And there is a market overhang\nfor -- from private sexual relations to prostitution, but\nwe don't say that because there is a market for\nprostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in\nthat market is economic. We look at the activities, and\nwe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to ask you one\nquestion about the activity --\nMR. BARNETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which was brought up before,\nand I just -- I've never understood this. I'm not an\nexpert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about\nit, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true\nthat medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that\npills are not. I really don't know.\nSo I would have thought that the people, like\nyour clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to\nthe FDA, and they would say to the FDA, \"FDA, take this\noff the list. You must take it off the list if it has an\naccepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety.\"\nThe FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it\nsays yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right\ninto court and say, \"That's an abuse of discretion.\"\nThe Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they\nwin. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse\nof discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably\nas a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has\nsome kind of special use.\nSo that would seem to me to be the obvious way\nto get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to\nthe correct characterization. And while the FDA can make\nmistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than\nmedicine by referendum.\nMR. BARNETT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's -- I just want to\nknow why.\nMR. BARNETT: Well, Your Honor, first of all,\nthat whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of\nCongress is to reach this activity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all true, but as long as\nthat hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on\nthe assumption that there is no such thing as medical\nmarijuana that's special and necessary?\nMR. BARNETT: I would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If has been done, maybe I\nshouldn't make it.\nMR. BARNETT: -- I would simply ask Your Honor\nto read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it\ndescribes the government's obstruction of scientific\nresearch that would establish the safety and efficacy of\ncannabis by denying supplies of cannabis -- of medical --\nof cannabis for medical experimentation.\nAnd then I'd ask Your Honor to read the\nInstitute for Medicine's report, that both the government\nand I -- and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has\nbeen no impeachment of this report by the National Academy\nof Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is\nthat the -- that what information we have is that cannabis\ndoes have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis\ndoes carry with it harms associated with it, as the -- as\nGeneral Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with\nit these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and\npeople are suffering and people are dying, they may be\nwilling to run the risk of these long-term harms in order\nto get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that\ncannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just\nask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are prescriptions, under\nCalifornia law, limited only to those people with life-\nthreatening illnesses?\nMR. BARNETT: They are limited to a list of\nillnesses that are in the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Some of the illnesses --\nMR. BARNETT: Some of which are life-threatening\nand some of which are not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In one -- in one plaintiff's\ncase, I think, there isn't a life-threatening --\nMR. BARNETT: That's correct, Your Honor. She\nhas -- she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be\ncontrolled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding\ncitizen. This goes back to the issue of what the --\nincentives there are that are created by this. This is a\nlaw-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the\nillicit-drugs market.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask you one\nprocedural question?\nMR. BARNETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is -- this is a suit\nfor an injunction. And it -- basically an injunction\nagainst a criminal prosecution.\nMR. BARNETT: And seizure --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And --\nMR. BARNETT: -- of these plants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and there's an old saying,\nin equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions.\nSo how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old\nsaying meant that you have to make your defense in the\ncriminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?\nMR. BARNETT: Well, it is -- it is an -- we're\nseeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the\nstatute against these two persons, which includes\nforfeiture, which has already happened in this case.\nWe've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug\nEnforcement Authority. That is not something that we --\nthat we -- that has anything to do with criminal\nprosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of\nmedicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to\nrelieve her suffering.\nI see my time is up. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Barnett.\nGeneral Clement, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAs I understand Respondents' position, it's\neffectively that their clients, and clients like them, in\ntheir use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically\nsealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it\nhas no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on\nthe government's overall regulatory regime. And I\nunderstand that to be true largely because of state law.\nAnd one of the many problems with that mode of\nanalysis is that the state law is not designed only to\ncarve out those transactions that have no effect on\ninterstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory\nregime. Proposition 215 was not passed as an exercise in\ncooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make\nmedical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it\nin interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the\nmarijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether\nyou bought it, whether you grew it yourself. There's a\nfundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I\nthink, undermines their theory.\nNow, there's the question now about what kind of\nimpact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme.\nNow, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from\none of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's\na hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical\nusers, if their position prevails. Now, obviously, this\nis all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation,\nso the numbers may be a bit off. But they suggest that\nour own government numbers are somehow better, and they\ncite them on page 18 of the red brief. But the only\nnumbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in\nthe four counties for which there are data, there was --\n.5 percent of the people use marijuana. Now, if you\nextend that out statewide to the 34 million people in\nCalifornia, that gives you 170,000 people. So their\nnumbers -- using the government numbers actually give you\nmore potentially affected people.\nI think in trying to figure out how many people\nwould be affected, it's worth considering what medical\nconditions are covered. And this responds to Justice\nKennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or\npeople with terminal cancer? And it's not. And if you\nwant to look at what is covered as a serious medical\ncondition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of\nthe red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it\nsuggests that a serious medical condition -- there's a\ncatchall at the end that includes subsection 12 -- \"Any\nother chronic or persistent medical system that, if not\nalleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety\nor physical or mental health.\" Now, I think that is an\nexceedingly broad definition of a serious medical\ncondition for which somebody could be -- get a\nrecommendation for marijuana for medical uses.\nAnother point worth considering, in considering\nthe impact on the federal regulatory regime or the\neffectiveness of California in preventing any diversion,\nis to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief.\nOne is the People against Wright. There's somebody who's\narrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana.\nThey're packaged such that he has one small bag in his\npocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his\nbackpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then\na pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck. And\nyet the Appellate Court in California said that he was\nentitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was\nfor medical use. The fact that he had a scale, and the\nfact that it was packaged the way it was, could be\nexplained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and\nthat he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off.\nI think that shows that it's going to be very hard to\nenforce the regulatory regime.\nThe other case in the reply brief worth\nmentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case\nwhere a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said\nthat it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled\nSubstances Act against a 250-person cooperative. And that\njust shows that this is not something that will be limited\nto one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial\nimpact on the government's ability to enforce the\nControlled Substances Act.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Clement.\n"
