BEDERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, good\nmorning and may it please the Court:\nAt the heart of this appeal is a matter of\nstatutory construction. Respondent received $2.3\nmillion in public funds under the Victims Protection and\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act. TRIA provides, and this\nis at the blue brief, page 11a, that a party electing to\nreceive such funds must relinquish rights with respect\nto enforcement against property that is at issue in\nclaims against the United States before an international\ntribunal or that is the subject of awards by such\ntribunal.\nThe property in question here is the Cubic\njudgment. Respondent renounced rights to attach the\nCubic judgment because in case B/61 before the\nIran-United States Claims Tribunal at the Hague the\nUnited States has demanded that any awards Iran receives\nin its claim against the United States be set off by the\namount of the Cubic judgment. This can only occur if\nthe Cubic judgment is released from Respondent's lien\nand is remitted to Iran's Ministry of Defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they could\nhave agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and\nany amounts would be set off by that. That wouldn't\nmake that bank account at issue with respect to their\nclaim.\nMR. BEDERMAN: No, in that scenario I agree\nwith you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be\nimplicated, because I think the clear import of the\nstatutory language here that Congress is trying to\nachieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the\nstatutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive. It refers\nto claims against the United States -- at issue in\nclaims against the United States before an international\ntribunal, or that is the subject of an award. So I\nthink the disjunctive character of the statute might\nindicate that the at-issue prong includes a broader set\nof property than would be indicated possibly by the\n\"subject of an award.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter\nthat Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off\na judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well\nthey could -- a bank account could be used to set it off\nand that's not sufficient.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, the mutual -- let me be\nclear. The mutual position of Iran and the United\nStates before the Claims Tribunal is that the Cubic\njudgment, because it's related to a claim within the\ntribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that's a key\nlimiting principle here. The United States would not be\nentitled to set off amounts in bank accounts that are\nattributable to other parties or other aspects that are\nnot implicated in claims or defenses before the\ntribunal.\nSo clearly an examination of the tribunal's\njurisdiction and the relevant claims or defenses that\nare before the tribunal is relevant here. Petitioner is\nnot espousing a position before this Court that any\ninchoate property located anywhere in the world would be\nblanketed with immunity under this provision. It's not\nnecessary to reach that conclusion in order to find for\nPetitioner here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The United States at some\nstage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic\njudgment -- and now I'm quoting -- \"has nothing to do\nwith matters before the international tribunal.\"\n\"Nothing to do with.\"\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, that is the language\nused by the United States in a memorial before the\ntribunal. The United States has also indicated, and\nthis is clear in the gray brief at pages 81 in note 32\nand the gray brief at pages 83 to 85, and in the\nlodgment, that if -- if Iran receives an award in case\nB/61 it must be offset or set off, or \"recouped\" is\nsometimes the language used in the correspondence\nbetween the two governments before the tribunal, by the\namount of the Cubic judgment.\nI won't speak for the United States position\nbefore the tribunal. The United States is here to do\nthat, of course, Justice Ginsburg. But the only way I\ncan interpret that remark is to indicate that obviously\nbefore the tribunal is the issue of the United States'\nobligations to Iran under the Algiers Accords. The\nCubic judgment deals, of course, with the private\ndisposition of the contractual relationship between\nIran's Ministry of Defense and the Cubic military\ncontractor.\nNow Respondents take the position that these\ntwo make the matters unrelated. But if you review\ncarefully the tribunal's jurisdiction as encompassing\nboth claims and counterclaims, and according to the\nAlgiers Accords in the claims settlement declaration,\ncounterclaims include that which arises out of the same\ncontract, transaction or occurrence that constitutes the\nsubject matter of the claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no counterclaim\nstated before the tribunal as of this moment.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the\nfirst.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no counterclaim\nin the case before the tribunal.\nMR. BEDERMAN: That's right. The United\nStates did not file a formal counterclaim in case B/61,\nbut it has made a demand for a setoff. And within the\ntribunal rules, a setoff can be the subject of notice\nunder Rule 19-3 or an amendment or certainly comes under\nwaiver of objection provision in Rule 30.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask that\nquestion. In other words, there are cases or at least\nit is contemplated that there will be cases under the\nrules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does\ndetermine that there should or should not be an offset.\nMR. BEDERMAN: There -- there certainly have\nbeen cases, if you are speaking of the tribunal's\nearlier jurisprudence in terms of offsetting claims.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, there has certainly been\nample tribunal precedent which the United States has\nrelied upon in making this demand for a setoff.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But assuming -- assuming\nthe tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy\nhas mentioned, it will start with the assumption that\nthe Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment. It will\nnot look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Of course, the validity of\nthe Cubic judgment does remain on appeal when the Ninth\nCircuit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's an entirely\nseparate proceeding. Assuming the Cubic judgment has\nnot been reversed through the appellate process that it\nis going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic\njudgment as it finds it.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I would assume it would. And\nI assume --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Doesn't it make it\npretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?\nMR. BEDERMAN: No, Justice Souter. If -- if\nwe understand Congress' -- I don't -- I think this\nmatter can be resolved by a straightforward textual\napproach in looking at TRIA section 201(c). Evidently,\nthough, if we are looking at congressional intent here,\nit is to protect the United States' litigation position\nbefore the tribunal. To allow the attachment of the\nCubic judgment would simply be allowing Respondent to\nremove a source of money that would be available --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I think we\nunderstand that. And -- and it's clear that the United\nStates, in effect, is taking the position that that's\nall we need to bear in mind. But it suggests to me that\nthe drafting of the statute did not go as far as it\nmight have gone to protect the interests of the United\nStates.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I won't speak, of course, for\nthe United States' position. The Petitioner's position\nis that where property has been identified to the\ntribunal as being related to a claim or defense within\nits jurisdiction, and the availability of that property\naffects the relief that can be granted by the tribunal,\nit is at issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain to me why it\nwould effect the relief? Because suppose Iran doesn't\nget the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a\ncreditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets\nit. It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's\nbill. Iran owes money to X. Why shouldn't the United\nStates equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment\nin the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor,\nElahi?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, obviously we await the\ntribunal's award in this respect. And I believe, based\non the tribunal's past precedents, the benefit in terms\nof finding a breach of the Algiers Accords as it would\nor it must in this case to find in favor of Iran, would\nindicate that the benefits accruing for certain setoffs\nmust ultimately come back to Iran in order to be\ncredited in the way that you suggest.\nI think it is an improper position to\nsuggest that if a creditor of Iran or Iran's Ministry of\nDefense in this instance can claim or assert the lien so\nthat somehow it's credited to Iran's account, so to\nspeak, in calculating the setoff of the tribunal. That\nhas not been the tribunal's jurisprudence in terms of\nexamining the implications of a breach by the United\nStates under the Algiers Accords. And in a number of\ncases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you -- something\nthat I would just like clarification on. You mentioned\nthat the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth\nCircuit. It has been on appeal since June of '98?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, ma'am.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there are cross\nappeals. What are the positions taken about that\njudgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending\nfor ten years?\nMR. BEDERMAN: That has been a mystery to me\nas well. In fact, there has been a resolution by Cubic\nDefense Systems and Iran's Ministry of Defense and as\nsoon as the Court renders its judgment in this case,\nthat matter will finally move to disposition. It is a\nbit odd that the underlying issue of Cubic's objections\nto the district court's enforcement of the International\nChamber of Commerce or ICC arbitral award has pended for\nso long. I would have thought, logically, it would have\nmade more sense to have disposed of those issues and\nthen allow the disposition of the liens to be resolved\nby the Court.\nEssentially, it is Cubic's appeal\nchallenging aspects of the district court's enforcement\nunder the New York convention of the ICC arbitral award.\nI think to the extent that there is a counterclaim it's\nsimply that there were some bases for support of the\njudgment which Iran's Ministry of Defense would have put\nforward in addition to the district court. That's what\nI understand in terms of the ruling of Judge Brewster\noriginally in the district court on this manner.\nSo, yes, it is unfortunate that the\nunderlying validity of the Cubic judgment still remains\nopen as a matter of appeal.\nBut again to return to your point,\nJustice Ginsburg, in Cases 815 and 821 before the\ntribunal this question of what would be the\nimplications, financial and otherwise, for the United\nStates being found by the tribunal to be in breach of\nthe Algiers Accords because of the failure of not\nallowing the export of Iranian property or repatriation\nof Iranian property to the United States has been\nexplicated. And, in fact, in already one instance the\ntribunal has found the United States to be in breach of\nAlgiers Accords obligations.\nSo again, I can't speak for what a ruling in\nthe tribunal would be. All I can suggest is certainly\nthe Iranian position before the tribunal would be that\nin the instance that if Mr. Elahi or any other lienor\nwere successful in attaching the Cubic judgment that in\nsuch a situation it should not be credited as a setoff\nunder these circumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could -- let's assume\nthat the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic\njudgment. Could it take the proceeds out of the United\nStates, given the 2007 blocking order?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, I mean, the issue of\nthe secretary of state's October 2007 designation, which\nI think is what you are referring to, is a late\ndevelopment in this case. Of course, that occurred\nthree months after the Ninth Circuit's amended opinion.\nMy submission to this Court is that the\nappropriate disposition, assuming the Court well takes\nPetitioner's position that Respondent has actually\nrelinquished its claim under TRIA, is to remand back to\nthe district court, because then we would have two new\nsets of lienors, Mr. Raffi and Mr. Rubin. It would be\nbefore the district court that factual issues like\nwhether the designation of the \"Ministry of Defense and\nArmed Forces Logistics,\" which is what is actually named\nin the blocking order, actually covers the Ministry of\nDefense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, who is your Petitioner today.\nThe issue of whether designations cover\nparticular entities or aliases of entities is an\nintensity factual one; the D.C. Circuit in the National\nCouncil of Resistance case, Chief Justice Roberts, an\nopinion you are well aware of at the D.C. Circuit.\nThese are intensely factual inquiries about whether\naliases of particular organizations are covered by\ndesignations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned -- you\nmentioned that there were other claimants or others --\nothers who would like to execute --\nMR. BEDERMAN: Other lienors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- other lienors -- other\nattachments. And so, you said in the end -- well --\nwell, what would be the effect of those other liens?\nMR. BEDERMAN: My understanding,\nJustice Ginsburg, is in both the cases of Mr. Rubin and\nMr. Raffi, as far as I am aware, they have not made the\nrelinquishment election under TRIA as Dr. Elahi has done\nhere. And because they have not made the relinquishment\nproviso, they would not be subject to the at-issue\nquestion that is now before the Court.\nIran's Ministry of Defense has other\nsubstantive defenses against their liens, which we\nappropriately presented before the district court.\nThe only submission I am making to this\nCourt at this time is that it is not necessary for this\nCourt exercising plenary authority to decide whether\nit's a blocked asset. That is appropriate for remand\nbecause, notwithstanding the U.S. position, I think\nthere are questions of whether your Petitioner is a\ncovered entity under the -- under the designation, and\nwhether in fact it is the beneficial owner, whether\nIran's Air Force is the beneficial owner of this claim.\nAnd there are other substantive defenses that claim\nretroactivity, as well. So, again, I just don't think\nit's appropriate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But going back to the main\nissue, the only reason that this is at issue before the\nIran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the\nevent of judgment in favor of Iran?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes. Whether it is available\nfor setoff. And again, I want to be clear that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the -- that's\nthe only basis for your argument? I thought it was a\nbroader suggestion that these are, to some extent,\nsubstitute assets for the assets that are at issue?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Well, I mean, that may be one\nuseful analytic in thinking about this. I was trying in\nimagining the interest of the Court in understanding the\ntribunal's jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords and\nwhat the tribunal has already ruled, and that's why I\nthink respectful consideration might be appropriate\nhere, inasmuch as the tribunal, in interpreting its\njurisdiction under the Algiers Accords, which is\nessentially its organic instrument, has made a\ndetermination in Case B/66 that the substantive\ncontracts at issue here between Cubic and the Iranian\nAir Force are at issue in case B/61.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- can you\narticulate a general test in a sentence or two about how\nyou decide whether particular assets are at issue?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes. I will repeat the one I\n-- I rendered before because I think it is the most\nuseful analytic, and I -- I take no credit. This is\nessentially Judge Fisher's analysis in the dissent\nbelow. As he indicated, that -- that -- where property\nhas been identified to the Tribunal -- and certainly the\nCubic judgment and the proceedings that have occurred in\nthe Federal district court in -- in Southern California\nand now the Ninth Circuit and now here have been\nidentified to the Tribunal in mutual representations and\nundertakings by the parties. Where this property has\nbeen identified to the Tribunal as being related to a\nclaim or defense within the Tribunal's jurisdiction --\nand I think that is the key limiting principle here.\nThat's -- there is a criticism that an expansive reading\nof TRIA's \"At Issue\" provision will allow Iran and the\nUnited States, as unlikely as it sounds, to mutually\ncollude to cover various properties and assets around\nthe world, I think noting that the -- that the Cubic\njudgment is within the Court's jurisdiction as\nunderstood under the Algiers Accords Claims Settlement\nDeclaration, Article 2, paragraph 3.\nAnd then the second prong is that the\navailability of that property affects the relief that\ncan be granted by the Tribunal. And, again, we are not\nhypothesizing here. The Tribunal has already indicated\nin cases like Owens Corning, Futura Trading and Computer\nServices, that when you have a situation avoiding a\ndouble recovery, that a setoff derived from collateral\nproceedings, even absent privity of contract with the\nsovereign seeking adjustment and with respect to\ndifferent causes of action, a setoff is still\nappropriate within the Tribunal.\nSo it's both an avoidance of a -- of a\ndouble-recovery rule and also a notion that a -- a\ncertain offset is -- is related as within the -- the\njurisdiction of the tribunal as arising again from the\nsame contract transaction or occurrence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"At Issue\" means related to\n-- \"At Issue\" means related to an issue in a separate\ncase.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what it boils down\nto, doesn't it?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Petitioner is not taking the\nsame --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, doesn't it?\nMR. BEDERMAN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry.\nThe Petitioner's position is slightly more modulated\nthan the United States. The United States' position\nhere is all it has to be is relevant. I -- I will leave\nit to the Court to -- to speak with the United States\nabout that in a moment.\nI think a more nuanced understanding of the\nTribunal's jurisdiction is appropriate here. Is -- and\nhere there is no question, based on the materials that\nyou have not only in the joint appendix but also in the\nlodgment, that the Cubic contracts have been identified\nto the Tribunal. And now the Cubic judgment as an\noffset has a setoff -- or \"recoupment\" is sometimes the\nlanguage used in the diplomatic exchanges and filings\nbefore the Tribunal -- has now been identified to the\nTribunal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case that there\nare two other individuals who have attached this\njudgment?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. I think\nI spoke about that a moment ago. That would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And is it the\ncase that Iran's position in respect to those\nattachments is that those attachments, insofar as they\nare valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever\nwe owe Iran or vice-versa?\nMR. BEDERMAN: My understanding, if you are\nspeaking of me characterizing the United States'\nposition --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm saying I take\nit from something I have read in this that Iran believes\nthat if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is\nfrom someone like Cubic --\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- who they thought was\nprevented from delivering planes because of the embargo\n-- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they\nget if they collect on it, should be deducted from other\nmoney the United States owes them.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- unless instead of them\ngetting it, the attacher gets it.\nMR. BEDERMAN: It's the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The attachee gets it.\nMR. BEDERMAN: It's the \"unless,\" I suppose,\nthat, of course, Iran objects to. It is that in order\nfor the setoff to be effective within the Tribunal's\njurisprudence and jurisdiction, Iran's Ministry of\nDefense or -- or the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Has to get the money for\nthe attaching person. That's my point.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so that is at issue\nbefore the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases.\nIf the person who attaches it gets the money rather than\nIran, Iran will say: We do not have to have a setoff.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I agree. If it's at issue --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that right or --\nMR. BEDERMAN: Correct. If it's at --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that is the same\nquestion that you think would be presented through this\nattachment, is that right?\nMR. BEDERMAN: I thought that's what we were\nspeaking of: The status of the Cubic judgment and --\nand Dr. Elahi's attachment of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Dr. Elahi is one of several\npersons, is that right?\nMR. BEDERMAN: That is correct. There is a\nqueue of individuals who have lined up to -- to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to get at\nis Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the\nsame as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments\non the Elahi judgment.\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That if Iran ends up with\nthe money, you can subtract it from other money the\nUnited States owes them. But if the attaching people\nend up with the money, you cannot.\nMR. BEDERMAN: So it's \"At Issue\" -- I am --\nI am sorry for having been so opague. It is \"At Issue\"\nin the sense of \"joinder at issue,\" a legitimate\ndisagreement between the parties. And its also \"At\nIssue,\" I believe -- I think in the sense that Congress\nintended by this provision of saying that the funds are\navailable for a tribunal ruling. And, therefore, to\nallow an attachment under these circumstances would\nfrustrate the United States' litigation position. So\nany way you parse what \"At Issue\" means --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You would take the same\nposition if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran\nby -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a\njudgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran,\nCubic had written them a check, and they had taken the\ncheck and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put\nit in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or\none of the other two people sought to attach the bank\naccount or the house or the grocery store, which they\nmight have also have used. Am I right --\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or wrong?\nMR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Justice Breyer, you are\ncorrect. There is a concern, which is a very natural\nconcern, that the more attenuated you get, can you\nattribute a particular property, whether it's a bank\naccount or a -- or a New York condo --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why either is\nthe slightest a bit more attenuated. In either case\nthey are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.\nMR. BEDERMAN: I would certainly concur;\nand, if I may, I will reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nBederman.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe United States does not appear here today\nin support of Iran, but, rather, in defense of critical\ninterests of the United States before the United States-\nIran Claims Tribunal. In particular, the holding of the\nCourt of Appeals that the United States never unblocked\nIranian military assets after the Algiers accords is\ndirectly contrary to the position of the United States\nbefore the Tribunal, and Iran immediately indicated that\nit would use that holding against the United States and\nin support of its multimillion-dollar --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not saying\nthat. Isn't that -- that issue is moot?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nthere is now a new and independent reason why the asset\nis blocked. And, in fact, Respondent no longer defends\nthe holding of the court of appeals on that basis.\nIt is, we wish to emphasize, essential that\nthis Court vacate that holding and indicate that it is\nno longer legally valid so that it is not -- that\nerroneous holding is not used against us in support of\nIran's two-million-dollar claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we -- if we took\nthe position that you are expressing about what is at\nissue, we would never reach the second question.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, we -- we\nthink that the Court would not. It would vacate the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals. It would be helpful\ncertainly to the United States if the Court emphasized\nthe natural fact that that would mean that the court of\nappeals' erroneous holding was not any longer legally --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not our job\nto help you -- it's not our job to help you in other\ntribunals. If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot.\nWe are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit\nto revise its opinion just because that's helpful to\nyou.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The -- the\nCourt would vacate the decision, certainly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it your\nposition that that -- that is moot?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is our position\nthat the -- because Respondent has relinquished his\nright to attach these assets, the decision of the court\nof appeals should be vacated. And that would have the\naffect of rendering inoperative that erroneous -- the\nother erroneous holding of the court of appeals with\nrespect to blocked assets.\nIt is the position of the United States --\nand we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of\nnow, because of the October, 2007, designation, the\nproperty of Petitioner is blocked and subject to\nattachment under TRIA. And I don't believe there is any\nneed for further proceedings on that.\nThe Secretary of State designated the\nMinistry of Defense of Iran, and the position of\nPetitioner in the court of appeals on remand from this\nCourt was that it is the Ministry of Defense of Iran, a\ncentral core constituent part of the Iranian state, that\nis the entity that was designated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand correctly\nthat that means that because it's a blocked asset, then\nDr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Elahi, Respondent\nElahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his\nrights to attach --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- assets at issue\nbefore the tribunal. As of right now, the asset is\nblocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right\nnow. Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as\nof right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot\nrepatriate it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why isn't the\nconsequence that you are so worried about under the\nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that\nthis is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the\nsame consequence that is going to come from the fact\nthat these assets are blocked?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nagain, the blocking order is the present status of the\nassets. It doesn't mean that they could not later be\nrepatriated to Petitioner; whereas, execution by\nRespondent against the assets would mean that they would\nbe forever denied to Petitioner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why wouldn't the\nUnited States get credit for that, too, on the theory\nthat I suggested before?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, you are\nright, Your Honor, that is the position of the United\nStates. And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the\noral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe\nit was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment\nis -- that the tribunal doesn't have to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with\nmatters before the --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is in the\ncontext of our saying that, whether or not -- in the\nview of the United States, whether or not Petitioner\never collects that money, the United States is entitled\nto an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete\ndefense to Iran's claim.\nOf course, Petitioner's argument -- or\nIran's argument before the tribunal is that it is --\nthat the United States is entitled to a reduction of\nliability only if Iran actual receives the assets. And\nthat's why the language of the statute is written more\nbroadly when the litigation before the tribunal is\nongoing. At that point any property that is at issue\nbefore the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one\nwho has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor\nany other lower court in the United States is supposed\nto pre-judge the merits of those respective positions.\nIran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United\nStates' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless\nreceived by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief\nwhich the United States may be found to owe Iran.\nSo that is Iran's position. That is at\nissue before the tribunal.\nThe Respondent would have the Court believe\nthat the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature\nof an in rem proceeding, that it's a property dispute.\nThey use that term repeatedly in the brief, \"a property\ndispute.\" But that is not the nature of the proceedings\nin the tribunal. Iran has asserted a claim that the\nUnited States violated its obligations under the Algiers\nAccords. The remedy it seeks is , and I quote -- this\nis from -- excuse me -- from the -- let's see -- the\nremedy they seek -- they seek is the value of the Cubic\nsale to Canada. They have said that in the state -- in\nIran's reply in statement -- claim 16 that Respondent\nrelies upon, they say that the remedy they seek is not\nthe asset itself.\nOf course, the asset had been dissipated\nbefore Iran ever filed a statement of claim against the\nUnited States. The remedy is the proceeds of that sale\nto Canada. The proceeds of the sale to Canada, which\nare the subject of Iran's claim against the United\nStates in the tribunal, have been reduced to judgment in\nthe Cubic judgment. That --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess this may be\nthe same question Justice Breyer asked. I mean, where\ndo you cut this off? You've got the proceeds from the\nsale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then\nCubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with\nthose proceeds and then sells it to somebody else. I\nmean, are those still assets at issue in the claims\nbefore the tribunal?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I believe\nthat in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the\nassertions of the parties before the tribunal that\ndefine the property that is at issue before the\ntribunal. That, again, is so that the courts are not\nput in a position of adjudicating, prejudging, the\nmerits of the parties' arguments before the tribunal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of\na -- that's a broad assertion. In other words, so long\nas you and Iran get together and say this asset is at\nissue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not\nsaves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to\nbe a very self-serving legal test.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\ndon't believe that this Court needs to consider what the\nouter reaches are. In this case, this is -- Iran\ncharacterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85\nof the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote\n\"constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in\ncase B/61.\"\nThis isn't an offset or a counterclaim.\nJustice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the\nUnited States did not file a counterclaim. And that's\nbecause this is not some unrelated counterclaim the\nUnited States has against Iran. This is a critical part\nof Iran's claim against the United States. It defeats,\nin the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely.\nAt the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim\nagainst the United States.\nThis isn't somehow unrelated; we're\nasserting, well, we can use this as an offset because\nyou also owe us money from something else. This is in\nIran's own statement, and this is the statement that you\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But how is that affected\n-- how is that affected depending on whether or not the\njudgment is executed or not. Would the Iran tribunal\nhave the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the\njudgment, but to just hold the funds?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I don't know.\nCubic is not before the tribunal. But what we can ask\nis, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively\neasy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that\nsays, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the\nCubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States\nowes Iran nothing. And clearly, in that circumstance,\nthe Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the\ntribunal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know that it's the\nsubject of the award. And it's really not at issue;\nit's just recognizing that there has been some prior\ntransaction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I guess, Your\nHonor, you have to think what does it mean for any\nproperty -- property to be at issue before the tribunal\nor the subject of the award?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It means that at the end of\nthe proceeding one side or the other gets the property.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that is not going to be\nthe -- what one side or the other gets in this\nproceeding is going to be a new judgment. And that new\njudgment may or may not be satisfied by dealing with the\nprior judgment. But that doesn't mean that the prior\njudgment is at issue; it simply means that the prior\njudgment may be used to discharge in an appropriate case\nan obligation which is determined in the later\nproceeding.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If I may respond.\nYour Honor, on that view, even the ACMR is not at issue\nbefore the tribunal, because the tribunal cannot order\nthe United States to hand over the ACMR to Iran. In the\nA/15 judgment to which Petitioner's counsel alluded\nearlier, the tribunal recognized that it is not a\nviolation of the United States' obligations under the\nAlgiers Accords not to issue an export license.\nTherefore, Iran --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So Iran --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- is not entitled\nto the ACMR. It's entitled to its loss, and its loss\nhas been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you, Your\nHonor.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think the previous 25 or so minutes has\ndemonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that\nthere is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to\ninterpret the language of this statute broadly, that it\nwill easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements\nbetween Iran and the United States in ways that\nfundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people\nthat Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire\nstatutory scheme.\nThis is a scheme that was designed to\nprovide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of\nterrorism. And somehow in the scheme of everything that\nwas discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this\nargument, the victims of terrorism are completely\nshunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical\nways of reading it.\nBut if we go back to the language of the\nstatute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it\ntalks about \"enforcement against property that is at\nissue in claims against the United States.\" So the\nnotion that we would focus on the word \"property,\" as it\nrelates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in\nfront of it, is a natural consequence of the language of\nthat provision. And to me, at least, the best way to\nlook at the logic is to review how often the United\nStates has described and Iran has described what was the\nproperty at issue before the claims tribunal and the\nB/61 proceeding? And this is at 65a of the joint -- of\nthe government's brief: \"The property at issue consists\nof one air combat maneuvering range system and all\nnecessary subparts.\" There is no dispute that the\nproperty was within the jurisdiction of the United\nStates. Now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you had\nthese military assets, which are clearly the assets that\nare at issue in Iran's claim --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Cubic is worried\nabout what to do with it and so they sell them to the\nCanadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under\nthe theory that look we may end up owing this to the\nIranians under the tribunal. Under the setoff, this may\nnot be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a\nclaim to these. Would those -- would those escrow funds\nbe assets at issue?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think they would be because\nof the way the Iranians actually pled this. They said\ngive us either back -- give us either the military\nequipment that we bought, or give us the economic value\nof that. But that's -- and that's why --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is that\nvery different from this situation, where you have an\narbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the\nequivalent of what you should have -- what you would\nhave provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the\nrevolution?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two answers\nto that. The first one is remember precisely what the\narbitration award is. The arbitration award is not the\nvalue of the asset. That was asked for; that was\nrejected by the arbitrator. The arbitration award is\nfor the value of a separate contract between Cubic and\nthe Canadian government. You will recall in the award,\nspecifically the arbitrator said with respect to the\nunderlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually\nwalked away from by both parties, and then there was a\nseparate agreement that was entered into between the\nparties, and that was the basis for the arbitration\naward saying the value of breach of that secondary\nagreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award.\nThat it seems to me ought to be regarded at a minimum as\none step too far removed, because that's not the\nproperty that is at issue before the claims tribunal in\nany way that the parties are disputing about it. They\naccept that number. And then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. So what is the --\nit seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either\nway. Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets\nthat we blocked and they get some money, and they did it\nunder their contract, and they got 2 million dollars.\nAnd suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they\npay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account\nor buys the grocery store. All right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now suppose that happened.\nIt makes it simpler. And then what happens is three\npeople, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't\naccept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground\nIran owes us this money.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We want the grocery store.\nAnd suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their\nmoney, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what\nyou owe us. But if we get the money, then you can\nsubtract it. That's their view.\nThe United States' view is different. Who\nwill resolve that question? The tribunal. So they say,\nwhat is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what\nis at issue is the question of whether we get the money\nor you get the money. What money? The money that is\nthe value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in\nwhich case it's identical.\nNow I think in that situation it's easy for\nme to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank\naccount, of course is at issue before the tribunal. For\nthe question is, does Iran get it or does the United\nStates get it, in the situation where the two other\npeople -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it. I\ncan easily read it that way. I can also read it the way\nyou want.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right? So now, which\ndo I do?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you clearly -- and I\nagree with you; there is no question you can read this\nstatute either way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll then add\nthat the strongest argument against you, it seems to me,\nis the whole point of this was not simply to compensate\nvictims of terrorism. That's a worthy goal, and that's\none of the points. But it was to compensate them\nconsistent with the proper running, in the interests of\nthe United States, of the Iranian-American Claims\nTribunal.\nAnd so this is just the kind of issue we\ndon't want to simply take away and let the victim have,\nbecause there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule\nagainst us, and we will have to pay it twice. Okay.\nThat's the argument against you.\nNow, what's the argument for you?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. First of all --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: A significant purpose of this\nentire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the\nvictims of terrorism.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's one, but --\nMR. PHILLIPS: 201(d) is a specific\nstatutory construction provision which seems to suggest\nthat Congress says that if there are doubts about how to\napply this particular provision, you ought to put the\nthumb on the scale in favor of the victim. So you do --\nyou will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA\nif you adopt a position consistent with our position.\nThe reality is that given that there are two\nmore lienholders in line, none of this has anything to\ndo with Iran and with the way the tribunal is going to\nproceed, because even if you were to say that Dr. Elahi\nis not entitled to this, there is no relinquishment\nclaim with respect to the others, so this money is never\ngoing back to Iran, under any set of circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That creates the issue,\nbecause the question is whether money that never goes\nback to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is\nmoney that is or money that is not subtracted from the\namount that the United States owes Iran.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that question is the\nquestion --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is the question that is\nbefore the commission.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the problem with this,\nJustice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment\nprovision. It -- it is saying to us in return for these\nlimited resources, 20 percent of the judgment -- and\nthat is only 20 percent of the compensatory judgment and\ncompletely lose the punitive judgment -- in return for\nthat you have to relinquish certain rights; and it seems\nto me that Congress would not have adopted the a\nprovision that said and the rights you relinquish are\nessentially unknowable under any circumstances and\nextend to the ends of the earth. What I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are totally knowable.\nThey are totally knowable. In order to decide what they\nare all you have to do is to look at the issues before\nthe commission and decide whether those issues concern\nspecific, concrete property; that is, the property that\nyou have an interest in.\nWith my grocery store, with my bank account,\nand with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran\nhas put before the commission the question of whether if\nyou pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get\nit, or we do get it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I gather. Now\nyou can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The parties have been very\nspecific about it, and we cited in a series of\nquotations about what is the property at issue here; and\nthe property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system\nor the economic value of the ACMR system. What is not\nat issue in this case is the value of the Cubic\njudgment. First of all, there was an effort to bring\nthe Cubic judgment specifically before the tribunal, and\nit was rejected as having no jurisdiction, certainly no\njurisdiction over Cubic and then no jurisdiction over\nthe United States' part of the Cubic judgment because\nthat was not a contract between --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are trying to attach\nthe ACMR system.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They did --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are trying to attach\nthe Cubic judgment. The ACMR judgment is in Canada.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that's the whole point of\nthis. The property at issue before the tribunal is the\nACMR system, and indeed in 1981 when this was originally\nbrought what Iran wanted was the ACMR system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's one piece of\nproperty. The other piece of property that is at issue\nis the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it\nthat two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran\nsays because they attach it, you don't subtract it from\nthe ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they\nattach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before\nthe tribunal as well.\nThat's my understanding at the moment, and\nI'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, there is no\nquestion that the fact that there are subsequent\nlienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would\nhave thought it would only affect it in a way that is\npositive for me. Because Iran is saying, look, this\ndoesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran\ntribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality\nis whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other\nlienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get\nthe money, which says to me it's not at issue under any\ntheory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims\ntribunal.\nAnd so that would be my quickest answer to\nthat; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it\nsimply means that there really is nothing at issue\nthere. But it still seems to me that the better way --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? I mean, the\nquestion I raised before, why wouldn't the United States\nbe urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the\nmoney or whether the people who are creditors of Iran\nget the money. In either case, the United States should\nbe able to have --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, the United States\nwould still have that -- would still have that argument,\nbut it's not a claim against the United States, which is\nwhat's required under the statute that we are dealing\nwith here when it's viewed that way.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Iran might say in the\ntribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this\nclaim that we brought against you, the United States,\nimplicates a breach of obligations that you have that\nare un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in\nthe -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment. And then the\nUnited States would say, no, that's not true. So they\nwould have to examine the Cubic judgment. So that means\nit's at issue before the court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think there is\nanybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some\nsense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't\nthink the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will\nunder any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic\njudgment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There might be in the\nsetoff proceedings. There might -- there might be an\nargument that there are two obligations, and there is a\nsetoff or that there is a setoff.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I think there\nis no question these are for two different obligations.\nAnd I think that's why candidly the Court ought to\ndecide that this is not property at issue here, because\nit is so clearly unrelated to the weapons system itself\nor to any monetization of the weapons system. Remember\nthe Cubic judgment comes from an arbitral award that\ndoesn't have anything to do with that arms sale. It has\nto do with a completely separate contractual undertaking\nbetween the Cubic and the Canadian government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think we might get\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and Iran.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- substantial -- a\nsubstantial degree of argument on that point.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know how there could\nbe an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy. If you\nread the opinion of the arbitrator, it is absolutely\nclear that the -- that the underlying agreement between\nIran and Cubic with respect to the arms sale was\nmutually terminated by the parties, and a new agreement\nentered into in order to resell those properties to\nCanada. The opinion is crystalline in that regard.\nAnd it was on the basis of the violation of\nthat separate agreement that the -- that Cubic was then\nheld to be liable to Iran for the $2.8 million.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The agreement\nbetween who -- between who --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Between Iran and Cubic.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Iran, I assume,\nwould say, look, we entered into this agreement to take\nthe place of what was at dispute. Which is what they\nowed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we\npaid for. I don't see that that adds anything to your\nargument.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it just says that you\nmove even further down the road from what are the\nproperties that are, in fact, at issue before the\ntribunal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, so Iran says,\nlook, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever\nit is, you are not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Although they wanted that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were not going\nto give us the money, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And they still want that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And we still have a\ndispute. So, I tell you what, you are going to sell\nthis stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money\nfrom them, and we have got an agreement that that money\nis ours.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, that --\nthat -- they may have been able to make that argument.\nThat is not an argument they have made. The argument\nthey made, which represents the property at issue in the\nclaims, is first, give us back the arms; and then two,\ngive us the value of those arms, not as they have been\nreformulated in a completely separate contract, give us\nthe value of those arms. It seems to me the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would\nCubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money\nif it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed\nthem in the original agreement?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the question was, they\nwere going to try to go forward in these arrangements.\nAnd it was a, you know, complicated problem because you\ncouldn't tell whether or not you would ever be able to\nsend things back to Iran, et cetera. And so, they were\nperfectly happy to enter into an agreement where they\nwould say, look, we will just do the best we can and see\nhow it turns out.\nI mean, in reality, the litigation in front\nof the Ninth Circuit, obviously, on the Cubic judgment,\nCubic is screaming loud and clear that they don't think\nthey owe a nickel as a consequence of this arrangement\nthat there had been no breach of anything under any\ncircumstances, and that there is not a penny that's to\nbe owed. And as counsel said earlier, it's in some ways\nunfortunate that this has moved in this sequence. So,\nwe don't really have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why it\nwas pending for ten years?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it was stayed as a\nconsequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence\nof these proceedings in order to allow, I think in\ngeneral the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at\nleast, some portion of these issues. It would obvious\nbe -- I mean, we have moved -- I mean, we are not a\nparty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the stayed\nbecause it was at issue before the Iranian claims\ntribunal?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I mean, the truth is\njust as the issue was a more important issue for the\nUnited States prior to the new blocking order, you know,\nthe questions that could potentially have arisen were\npotentially more important to the claims tribunal at the\noutset. As the litigation has played out, it turns out\nthat there's no relationship between the two.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the other\nthing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe\nyou have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of\nproperty that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that\nIran didn't get. And because they didn't get it, all\nkinds of things happened with property, and you get more\nof it or you get less of it. And during the interim\nyears all kinds of things happened.\nAnd it could be that those transformations\nat different times are directly before the tribunal,\nirrespective to how much damages you are going to get,\nand how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have\nthree or four hours. But you see where I am going?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I can understand\nCongress in passing this statute having one of two\npossible things: One is say we are just going to cut an\narbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what\nwe will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize\nanything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit\nwithin this. That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a\ncompromise.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it also provides\nprotection for victims, right, and those are the people\nwho are the most --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The other way to look at it\nis to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we\nwill pay these victims something; you know, they are\ngoing to get something right from Congress right now,\nbecause they are hurt. But in return from that, we\ndon't want you taking action that will really affect our\nliability to Iran. And if it's the second, then we\nneeded broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I think the\nHague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to\nunderstand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that\nline of cases all involve efforts to seize consular\nproperties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords,\nand every one of those courts of appeals has concluded\nthat each of those properties is beyond the ability of\nthe courts to attach all of those properties.\nAnd -- and it seems to me that what Congress\nwas concerned about was having inconsistent claims\npotentially arise in both the district -- in federal\ncourt in the United States and in front of the claims\ntribunal.\nSo where you have a situation where the\nclaims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property\nthat belongs to the Iranian government, you should\nreturn it, and have the United States have to show up in\nfront of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but\nunfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property\nunder a federal court order and the embarrassment that\narises from that. That seems to me so clearly what\nCongress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by\nthis and the case law or all the case law up to this\npoint that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in\nfavor of the United States and Iran in that context.\nBut there is no reason to go beyond that context in\norder to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a\nmeaningful remedy.\nAnd I think, Justice Breyer, just to be\nclear about this, we got money back, to be sure. A\nsubstantial portion of the money we got back came from\nthe values of the properties that the United States\nseized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out\nembassies and stuff like that. And that is not property\nthat comes out of the United States' fist.\nSo it's not reasonable to assume, as the\ngovernment does, that simply because these moneys were\npaid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is\nrequired there. It seems to me that it makes much more\nsense for this Court to narrowly construe this.\nI guess the last thing I would say in that\nregard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will\naffect one party -- actually, I guess the other two\nlienholders behind us. But realistically, there are no\ncases in the pipeline. There is no other litigation\nthat is on going out there. This is a singular -- I\nmean, it's kind of unusual for this Court, but this is\nthe only case that we can figure that this applies to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the point\nis, depending on how it comes out, once you give a\nargument to the Iranians that they can raise with the\nclaims tribunal that will affect far more than your one\nsingle case. We -- the argument would be the United\nStates is not living up to the obligations it undertook\nin the Algiers Accords.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And,\nMr. Chief Justice, that -- I understand why the\ngovernment filed in support of Certiorari at the earlier\nstages of this proceeding. But after the intervening\nblocking order that takes the -- I mean, that issue is\noff the table.\nWe are no longer defending the Ninth\nCircuit's view that the United States breached the\noriginal Algiers Accords in the context of this case.\nNothing in the blocking order that is in place now and\nwould prevent Iran from getting this remotely violates\nthe Algiers Accords. And as far as I know, no one is\nmaking that argument at this stage. So all you have is\na relatively clean -- issues. Does the blocking order\napply here in stopping the payment of these funds to\nIran? There the answer seems to me unquestionably yes.\nAnd then the second question is, do we adopt\na rule to the detriment to a single terrorist victim in\na way that deprives him of an opportunity to get back\nfair redress in the absence of some clear indication\nfrom Congress that it intended that result where it\nwould affect no one else and where Congress has said\nspecifically in a rule of construction, put your thumb\non the scale in favor of the victim of terrorism?\nThat's what we are asking the Court to do in this case.\nIt provides no problems to the United States in its\nclaims tribunal litigation. It's only an issue of\nmoney.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What provision --\ncan you cite me the provision where the Congress said\nput your thumb on the scale?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. It's 201(d)(4), the\nPetitioner's brief at 11a.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 11a. And how does\nthat -- the title of the section says statutory\nconstruction. I just don't see what follows as\nstatutory construction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what you have\nto do is give the language some credit. And our way --\nwhat we think Congress intended there was to say, tip\nthe scale in favor of the victims of terrorism, which is\nthe underlying purpose of the statute.\nI will confess, the language is not nearly\nas clear as I would like it to be, but I will also\nrecognize that the -- the Government of Iran's position\nrenders that language as total dead letter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't see any --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- alternative it seems to me\nyou ought to give it -- again, give the tie to the\nvictims under this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't see any\nproblem with Congress telling us how to conduct\nstatutory construction?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think Congress does --\nis entitled to suggest, if it's -- if you have ambiguity\nin our language, which way to come out as a matter of\npolicy. No, I don't think that's -- no, I don't think\nthat's dictating -- that's certainly not dictating a\nresult in this particular case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, one piece\nof -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States\ncould recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims,\nincluding Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million. How\nwould the United States go about recouping from Iran the\nmoney it has paid to the victims of Iran's terrorism?\nMR. PHILLIPS: You mean in the situations\nwhere the United States has subrogate -- right to\nsubrogation?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. How would that\nwork? How would -- how would the United States --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it would almost\ncertainly work as a matter of diplomacy and not as a\nmatter of adjudicated resolution. I think what they\nwill say is, these are rights, these are amounts of\nmoney that we have had to pay. And if we are ever to\nnormalize relations with the Government of Iran, we are\ngoing to expect the Government of Iran to recognize\nthose payments and to make some kind of retribution to\nthe United States under those circumstances.\nAnd again, all it does is it shifts the\nburden of these injuries from the victims, who are in\nthe least best position to deal with them, and put them\nin the United States, which is in a position of at least\nsome hope of being able to resolve them diplomatically\nin a way that the United States can, in fact, be\nrecompensed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said this is a one of\na kind case. Are there no other victims who have\nsuccessfully sued Iran?\nMR. PHILLIPS: There are, but the problem is\nyou have to back into the situation of property that is\nat issue in the claims tribunal. The claims tribunal\nwas created in '81. It's not a lot of that property\naround. We're talking 25 years later. So, they have\npretty much played out their course.\nThere were the Hague noted cases, and the\nElahi case. The others are going to be resolved without\nregard to these provisions. And so, the reality is what\nthe Court says today will affect my client, but as far\nas I can tell no one else. And certainly, the only\ninterest the United States has at this stage in this\nlitigation is its own financial interest. And it would\nseem to me, that's not a basis on which to interpret the\nstatute.\nIf there are no further questions, I urge\nthe Court to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Bederman, you have two minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DAVID J. BEDERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BEDERMAN: If I can make just a few\npoints. In response to Respondent counsel's assertion\nthat in the International Chamber of Commerce arbitral\naward there's been so form of novation here, which makes\nthe connection between the ACMR and the Cubic judgment\nsomehow attenuated. I think that's -- by the\ntribunal's -- the panel's discussion, this is at the\njoint appendix at page 47.\nThe panel makes very clear that under the\nsales contract credit has to be given to Iran for its\nadvance payment. Here you have a breakout of the\nsalvage value of the ACMR. All that the panel was\nindicating was that Iran was not entitled to specific\nperformance here, to make that ruling is not a finding\nof a novation in the sense which would respond to\ncounsel using that phrase. So, I don't see the\nattenuation here.\nSpeaking to the assertion that, again, the\nenormous risk presented by this case of the broad\nconstruction of the congressional intent, I think if you\nlook carefully at the language at the blue brief at 11a\nof the statutory construction provision -- that was part\nof the colloquy between the Chief Justice and\nRespondent's counsel. And if you read this, it\ncompletely reserves, if not begs the question of whether\nthe Cubic judgment is, quote, an asset otherwise\navailable under the section for attachment.\nSo, I think it completely doesn't answer,\none way or the other -- a finger on the scale, as\nRespondent's counsel has evocably said, or some form of\ncommand by Congress to this Court. It simply reserves\nthat question for the Court's analysis.\nIn response to Justice Ginsburg's last\nquestion to Respondent's counsel, the one thing I would\npoint out to you again, is another clue in the statute.\nIf we look at the Victims Protection Act, which was the\npredecessor statute here, section 2002(c), what Congress\nwanted to protect is the right of the United States to,\nquote, pursue these subrogated rights as claims or\noffsets of the United States in appropriate ways.\nSo, again, Congress has contemplated the\nnotion that there will be a process of setoffs either\nbefore the Iran U.S. claims tribunal or in some other\ncontext, which I'm not sure I can imagine beyond what\nresponse counsel has said. So, to suggest that the\nbroad remedial thrust of TRIA, which Petitioner is not\ndenying -- it's not our place to deny that -- is\nnonetheless tempered by these carefully crafted\nprovisions in the statute.\nWe would support, obviously, reversal of the\nlower court's opinion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
