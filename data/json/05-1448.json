MILLER BAKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BAKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAfter filing for bankruptcy, Crown Vantage\ndecided to terminate 12 over-funded pension plans. By\nterminating these pension plans, Crown was able to\nprovide its plan participants with 100 percent of their\naccrued benefits and at the same time recover almost $5\nmillion in surplus plan assets for the benefits of both\nCrown's creditors as well as plan members who made\nindividual contributions to those pension plans.\nAfter Crown made the decision to terminate\nthese pension plans, it received a merger proposal from\nthe PACE union to merge the pension plan into the PACE\nmulti-employer pension plan. Crown rejected that\nproposal. The Ninth Circuit held that Crown breached\nits fiduciary duty by not sufficiently considering that\nmerger proposal.\nThis Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit\nfor two separate and independent reasons. First, merger\nis a nonfiduciary plan sponsor function and Crown could\nnot have had a fiduciary duty to consider the merger\nproposal by PACE. A series of this Court's decisions\nbeginning with Curtiss-Wright and continuing with\nLockheed, Hughes aircraft and Pegram hold that decisions\nto create, to modify, to terminate, or to amend pension\nplans are sponsor functions, settlor functions under\ntrust law, that are not subject to ERISA fiduciary\nduties.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I could understand that\nif the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a\nchange to the multiemployer plan while the business is\nongoing. But in this situation, you, you say if the\nemployer elects to have an annuity, then choosing which\ninsurance company is going to supply the annuity, that\nwould be a fiduciary function. Well, this is, the\ntermination, the merger that's proposed here, is instead\nof having an annuity we'll put the assets into this\nother plan. It's quite different from choosing a form\nfor an ongoing operation and saying, we're out of it and\nwe're now going to try to distribute the assets in the\nway that will best protect the beneficiaries.\nMR. BAKER: Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,\nthat's not correct. The answer to that question is that\na decision to terminate a plan or a decision to merge a\nplan requires that a plan sponsor consider as a\nthreshold matter several factors. First, what will the\nplan form be of the acquiring plan? And PACE's proposal\nwould have required the merger into a multiemployer plan\nas opposed to a single employer plan. That goes to the\nform of the plan. PACE's proposal would have resulted\nin a new plan sponsor and a new plan administrator. It\nwould have resulted in a new dispute resolution\nmechanism. That goes to the content of the plan. And\nfinally, most importantly, the PACE proposal would have\ngone to the level of benefits provided by the plan and\nthe level of benefits, as this Court has repeatedly\nrecognized is a decision that is a plan sponsor\ndecision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well if you're correct and\nthis was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision,\nlet me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is\nwearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to\nterminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the\nbest interests and the security of the employees, number\none, when it picks an insurance company? It can't pick\nsome flaky insurance company if there is a much more\nsolid insurance company, can it?\nMR. BAKER: Justice Kennedy, it depends upon\nthe function at issue. If the function is the selection\nof an insurance company to provide the annuity, that is\na plan administrator function and it is subject to ERISA\nfiduciary duties. But you is to analyze it from --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if have this duty to\nconsider the interest of the employees in selecting the,\nthe insurance company, in selecting the amount of the\nannuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me\nthat that's a fiduciary duty.\nMR. BAKER: It absolutely is, Justice\nKennedy, Kennedy. But it is only in the context of the\nselection of the annuity that the plan sponsor, the plan\nadministrator, must purchase after the plan sponsor has\nmade that threshold decision to terminate the plan.\nThere is that threshold decision. And likewise, merger\nis a threshold decision that goes to the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's I think our\nsticking point. If the, if the plan sponsor decides to\npurchase an annuity, it's accepted I think by you and by\neverybody that there are two decisions being made.\nDecision one is terminate the plan. Decision two,\ndistribute the assets by purchasing an annuity that\ngives the beneficiaries what they should get. And so\non.\nBut when we come to the question of merger,\nyou're saying there's only one decision, and I think\nthat's where I'm having trouble with your argument.\nWhen we come to the question of merger, it seems to me\nthere are two decisions again. The first decision is\nwe're going to terminate the plan that we've got. What\ndo we do with our assets. We have decided to merge --\none possible decision as an alternative to annuities is\nto merge the plan with, with another one. Why aren't\nthere two decisions in the merger case just as there are\ntwo decisions in the annuity case?\nMR. BAKER: There are two decisions in a\nmerger case and the threshold question, Justice Souter,\nis whether to merge. Whether to merge is a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say that's the\nthreshold question? I thought the threshold question is\nwhether to terminate what we've got now.\nMR. BAKER: That's a different question,\nJustice Souter. The question is whether to merge, and a\nquestion whether to merge goes to plan form, it goes to\nthe content of the plan and it also --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If they say, look, we're\nnot ending our plan. Let's assume you have an ongoing\nbusiness and they say, we're just sick of the form that\nit's in now and we can get a good deal by letting\nsomebody else administer this, so we're going to merge.\nI can see that as a single decision. But that's not\nwhat you've got here. As I understand it, the decision\nto terminate was made, it was over and done with. The\nquestion was what are they going to do with these\nassets? It's at that point that PACE arrived and said:\nGive them to us through a merger.\nI don't see how you eliminate the, the\ntermination decision before the merger decision.\nMR. BAKER: Justice Souter, there are two\ndifferent questions. One question is termination, one\nquestion is merger, and they're not the same. And the\nquestion whether to merge is a sponsor decision because\nyou have to make those threshold questions as to what\nwill the form of the plan be, what will the benefits\nprovided be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The form of the plan is\ngoing to be zero. Our plan is over. We are terminating\nour plan. What do we do now? We have two choices\nroughly, maybe three. We can either buy annuities, we\ncan give the assets to the beneficiaries or we can give\nthe assets to PACE in the form of a merger.\nMR. BAKER: It's not a disposition of\nassets, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying you can't\nhave a merger of a plan that has already been\nterminated, so that the merger decision is necessarily a\ndecision that has to be made before the termination --\nbefore a termination decision.\nMR. BAKER: It is -- once a plan decision,\nonce a termination decision has been made, and once that\ndecision has been executed, it's impossible to merge the\nplan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Baker, I thought your\nposition in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not\nmake this reply to this exchange, is that the merger\nwith another plan is not a termination, isn't that your\nbasic position?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I keep\nsuggesting.\nMR. BAKER: Absolutely, it's not a\ntermination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because if it were a\ntermination, in a termination, you must distribute the\nassets to the participants. And here when you merge\nwith somebody else, the assets are not distributed to\nthe participants, but they are thrown into a pot with\nother people.\nMR. BAKER: That's absolutely correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with Justice\nScalia, that that's one answer. On the other hand, you\nhave -- there are two arguments here. And what we are\nexploring now is whether this is a fiduciary obligation\nor a sponsor obligation.\nMR. BAKER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So we will have to assume\nfor that -- if you can't do it by merger, then the whole\ncase goes away anyway. If merger is not permitted under\nthe statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a\nfiduciary response, correct?\nMR. BAKER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So what we're asking in\nthe first part of this argument is whether or not it's a\nfiduciary response. And that's what Justice Souter and\nI are questioning. And it does seem to me, assume that\nthere is a meeting of the board of directors, we think\nwe are going to terminate this plan. At that point,\nchoices are made as to how to terminate it. And it's\ndifficult for me to see why the interests of the\nemployees are not uppermost in -- in your duties, i.e. a\nfiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to\nterminate it.\nMR. BAKER: The answer, Justice Kennedy, is\nthat it is a business decision to decide in what form\nthe benefits are going to be provided. And the very\nchoice between a termination and a merger goes to that\nissue. For example, in a merger, there is no automatic\nvesting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you say it's a\nbusiness decision as to which insurance company you're\ngoing to select. Maybe you do say that.\nMR. BAKER: Because at that point, it's a\nmere execution of the prior policy decision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the way\nyou characterize it. I don't know why it's mere\nexecution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere\nexecution when it's a merger, once the determination\ndecision has been made.\nMR. BAKER: Because the merger decision --\nyou have to ask those threshold questions, Justice\nKennedy, what are the level of benefits that are going\nto be provided in the acquiring plan. In a merger,\nthere is no automatic vesting of accrued benefits as\nthere is in a termination.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just listening to this.\nIt sounds to me as if you're saying, one, the employer\ndecides to terminate, okay? Now that's done. Then we\ngo to the next question. How would we terminate? And\nin respect to that, I think Justice Kennedy was asking,\nas I heard him, don't you have a fiduciary duty when you\ndecide how. And your answer, as I heard it, was yes,\nyou do.\nAnd now there is a third question. Does\nwhat happened in terminating mean that although you have\na fiduciary duty, you couldn't consider a merger,\nbecause that's just not consistent with the basic plan\nof terminating. Is that right? If it's wrong, don't\neven bother to answer it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't like to hear\nthat he is wrong.\nMR. BAKER: None of us do, Justice Scalia.\nThe answer to the third part of that question, Justice\nBreyer, is yes. But where I disagree with you is in the\nsecond predicate, which is that the -- the execution of\nthe termination is necessarily --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why did you answer yes to\nhis question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance\ncompany?\nMR. BAKER: Perhaps I was imprecise. If I\nwas imprecise, I apologize. The answer is, it depends\nupon the function at issue. A broad generalization that\nany decision taken after termination is necessarily a\nplan sponsor function is just wrong. One has to look at\nthe function at issue, and the function in connection\nwith a merger is a plan sponsor decision, because you\ncan't get away from those threshold questions as to the\nform, the content, and the benefits that are to be\nprovided in that plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't exactly the same\npoint true with respect to purchasing annuities?\nMR. BAKER: Because the decision has already\nbeen made, usually it's in the plan document, to provide\nfor annuities. And the only question is providing the\nannuity that is best suited to the interest of the\nprincipals.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the plan document\ndoesn't say anything about what will follow termination.\nThere is nothing in there about annuities. Is the\nannuity -- the decision to purchase annuities a decision\nsubject to fiduciary obligation.\nMR. BAKER: You mean the decision to offer\nannuities? Yes, Justice Souter. The decision to offer\nannuities, that is the provision, the actual selection\nof the annuities -- and I note that the Internal Revenue\nService will require --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The decision to -- to take\nthe option of purchasing annuities or offering annuities\nto the beneficiaries, that is a fiduciary decision.\nMR. BAKER: No, Justice -- the -- if the\nplan is silent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the plan is silent.\nMR. BAKER: If the plan is silent, and the\nplan sponsor -- and the question is, how do we\ndistribute, the mechanism of distribution. That is a\nplan sponsor function in the absence of any provision --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if they say, we will\ndistribute by going to the top of the building and\nthrowing the money out on the street. Fiduciary\nproblem?\nMR. BAKER: Well, that would not be\npermitted by the, by the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right --\nMR. BAKER: By operation of law, Justice\nSouter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nargument was, once you make a decision to terminate,\nthere are various rules that are triggered, you just\ncan't take the money and run with it. You've got to\nmake provision. And that merger was not one of the\npermitted ways of terminating a plan. Is that wrong?\nMR. BAKER: Well, that is a second argument,\nan alternative argument, Chief Justice Roberts, that\nmerger is not a means of termination. But the threshold\nquestion is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it's a simpler\nargument than this first one we've been wrestling with.\nMR. BAKER: Justice Scalia, they may have\ndifferent issues associated with them. But the\nthreshold question here is whether or not this is a plan\nsponsor decision. And a plan sponsor decision is always\na decision that goes to the content and the form of the\nplan, as well as to level of benefits to be provided.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is what's really involved in\nthis, who is going to get the $5 million reversion that\nyou would get if you purchased an annuity? Is that\nwhat's really in dispute?\nMR. BAKER: That's what's really in dispute,\nJustice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, PACE would like it,\nyou would like it. I mean, how would a fiduciary decide\nbetween those two, if it were a fiduciary duty.\nMR. BAKER: Well, it's not a fiduciary duty.\nThis Court's cases are -- the PBGC and the agencies\nrecognize that the decision to terminate in order to\nrecapture a reversion is perfectly permissible, so long\nas the plan sponsor complies with all the relevant\nrequirements of a termination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito's\nquestion, and I have the same question. Let's assume,\nA -- I know this is not your position -- but the merger\nis a permissible option. And B -- and I know this is\nnot your position -- that this is a fiduciary\nobligation. I assume then you would lose, because the\nextra assets must go, the reversion interest, must go to\nthe employees if it's in their benefit.\nMR. BAKER: If we lose on both the issues\nthat we have argued, Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is the\n$5 million is not going to these employees, it's being\nthrown into this vast sea of all these other employees,\nwhose employers have not done as good a job of funding\ntheir plans. This is to the benefit not to the\nbeneficiaries of this plan, but to other union members\nwho don't have the luxury of having an employer who has\noverfunded their plan, and are trying to get that five\nmillion to help them, not your beneficiaries.\nMR. BAKER: Well, that's absolutely correct.\nThe money here would have gone not to the plan members,\nbut to another union.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you say that if\nit's a fiduciary obligation, and the merger is a\npermitted option, that the administrator, A, can, or B,\nmust still give the money back to you.\nMR. BAKER: If it's a fiduciary obligation,\nno. If it's a fiduciary obligation, the plan sponsor,\nplan administrator -- because now we're talking about an\nadministrative function -- the plan administrator has a\nduty to carefully consider that option. It doesn't\nnecessarily result in the money automatically flowing\nover --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The administrator, as a\nfiduciary, can consider the interest of the employer as\nwell as the employees?\nMR. BAKER: No. The plan administrator,\nacting as a fiduciary, can only consider the interest of\nthe employees.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. Reserve your time.\nMR. BAKER: I'd like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn employer does not have a fiduciary duty\nto consider merger as a means of terminating a defined\nbenefit pension plan. First of all, just like the\ndecision to terminate the plan, the decision to merge\nthe plan is a sponsor function, because it's a choice to\nalter the design, composition and structure of the plan.\nAnd because both the decision to terminate and the\ndecision to merge are sponsor functions, the choice\nbetween the two is a sponsor function.\nThe plan administrator has a duty to carry\nout the sponsor's decision to terminate the plan, not to\nrevisit that decision by considering whether to merge\nthe plan instead.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the argument is\nmade very forcefully that the insurance companies with\nthese annuities haven't been doing so well, but there is\nthis multi-employer plan that has been just performing\nso well, and so the -- an appeal is made to the company,\nyou're going out of business, you're not going to be\nrunning a plan anymore. Put those assets, distribute\nthose assets to the place where they will serve the\nemployees best.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that would be not be a\ndistribution of the assets as a means of terminating the\nplan, but the employer as a sponsor could, of course,\ndecide to merge the plan instead of to terminate the\nplan, if the employer made that choice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're making the same\nrigid argument that Mr. Baker made, that whatever the\ntermination, even though the company is going out of\nbusiness, it's bankrupt, it's always -- a merger is\nalways characterized as a sponsor business, not\nfiduciary.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. There are two reasons\nthat I say that. First, even in the case of a sponsor\nof a plan that's going out of business, and that isn't\ngoing to be participating in any merged plan, the merger\nstill is a decision to alter the design and composition\nand structure of the plan, as this case illustrates for\nthe reasons that Mr. Baker said. That it's going to\nchange fundamentally the plan from a single employer\nplan to a multi-employer plan, that it's going to change\nthe -- who is the administrator, that it's going to\nincrease the pool of participants, that it's going to\naffect the benefits, because the assets that were\navailable to pay the benefits are now going to be\navailable to pay benefits of other participants in the,\nin the successor plan, that the PBGC's guarantee of the\nbenefits is going to be lower in a multi-employer plan.\nSo for all those reasons, it's going to\nchange, still change the structure of the plan. But in\naddition to that, the employer of -- the sponsor of this\nplan that would either terminate, or possibly merge, has\na legitimate interest in choosing termination rather\nthan merger, because in a termination, the sponsor can\nobtain a reversion of the surplus assets, and still\nfully provide all the benefits of the employees.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could an administrator\nmake that decision in its fiduciary capacity?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, and that goes\nback to a confusion that I think was -- was present\nbefore, that the decision about the distribution options\nat termination is a sponsor decision that the employer\nmakes in the plan documents, because those distribution\noptions are benefits under the plan.\nAnd while Section 1341(b)(3)(A), in\nisolation, might appear to permit the plan administrator\nto choose which of those distribution options that are\nin the plan to make available, other provisions of ERISA\nand the tax code prohibit the plan from vesting that\ndiscretion in the plan administrator.\nSo in other words, the way it works is when\nthe employer sets up the plan, the employer provides for\nthe forms of distribution that are going to be available\nat termination. And those forms are just forms of\nbenefits, optional ways of providing the accrued\nbenefits to the participants. And then the participants\nget to pick among those options at termination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why are we having this\nargument? Why isn't it simply a question of construing\nthe provision for options in the original plan.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we think that one\nrequirement is that it's consistent with the plan, and\nthe plan didn't provide that here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why isn't --\nMR. ROBERTS: Held it was waived.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why isn't the simple\nargument, you can't merge because the plan didn't\nprovide that as an option.\nMR. ROBERTS: That would certainly be a\nbasis on which the Court of Appeals could have correctly\ndecided this case, other than the way it did.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was that position\npresented, I should have asked you --\nMR. ROBERTS: It was presented. The Court\nof Appeals held that Petitioner had waived the argument,\nbased on the terms of the plan, because Petitioner\nhadn't made that argument in the bankruptcy court, even\nthough the district court had actually addressed the\nterms of the plan, but mistakenly construed the plan to\npermit merger, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So we've got to assume that\nthe plan is silent in the sense that, insofar as the\nplan documents are concerned, merger is at least a\npossibility.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think that you have to\nassume that, Your Honor. I think that because the Court\nof Appeals vacated the district court's decision, you\nknow, there is no decision on it. And if it's necessary\nto -- to resolving the questions presented, I think the\nCourt could address that question. We don't think it's\nnecessary to resolve the questions presented because we\nthink that merger is a, is a sponsor decision as a\nchoice to alter the design, composition and the\nstructure of the plan even if it arises in the context\nof termination.\nAnd in addition, we also think that\nmerger is not a permissible method of plan termination\nunder the statute or PBGC regulations which treat merger\nand termination as distinct procedures. The statute\nrequires that the assets of a terminating plan be\ndistributed by allocating them among the participants of\nthat plan. That just doesn't occur in a merger.\nInstead the assets are transferred to the successor plan\nand in the successor plan they are commingled to fund\nthe benefits of all the participants in that plan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could a plan document\nprovide that upon termination the employer is entitled\nto a refund of any excess funding? And would that then\nbe binding on an administrator in a fiduciary capacity?\nMR. ROBERTS: The plan document could\nprovide for a reversion for the employer and in fact\nthis -- it does. But the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it the\nadministrator would then have the duty to obey that?\nMR. ROBERTS: That. Yes, because that would\nbe consistent with ERISA and the administrator has to\nfollow the plan in accordance with ERISA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why doesn't the\nadministrator here take the position that it's going to\nreserve the five million for itself and merge what's\nleft? If PACE wants a merger with what's left, fine; if\nPACE doesn't, end of problem?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, an employer, not an\nadministrator could, could as a sponsor of the plan\ndecide to do a transfer of assets and liabilities of\nsome portion of the, of the plan assets and retain some\nassets in the plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My question is why -- why\nisn't it an option here to say all right, number one, we\ngot a $5 million surplus. We are going to terminate\nthis plan and we are going to take the five million.\nQuestion number two, should we, should we use what's\nleft to merge into the PACE plan? Is that an option?\nMR. ROBERTS: What the employer would have\nto do would be make a sponsor decision to make a\ntransfer of assets and liabilities to the PACE plan\nbefore terminating the plan. The employer could make\nthat decision but that, that decision and the decision\nafterwards to terminate the remains of the plan would\nboth be sponsor decisions that the employer wouldn't\nmake in a fiduciary capacity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: By doing it in that\nsequence could it reserve the five million for itself?\nMR. ROBERTS: It -- it could conceivably do\nthat, Your Honor, subject to the fact that there are\nguidelines that the agencies have put out, the 1984\njoint guidelines that require in some cases, in order to\nprevent circumvention of the termination requirements,\nthat require the purchase of annuities or the other\ndistribution of the assets, that those guidelines\nrequire that if there is a spinoff or a transfer of\nassets that's followed by the, by the termination of the\nremains of the transferee plan, that in some\ncircumstances annuities have to be purchased for the\naccrued benefits of the participants that are\ntransferred into the other ongoing plan and that are\ngoing to be participants of that plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we assume that, can they\nkeep the five million?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor but that would\nbe a decision that they make as sponsor of the plan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't care how they make\nit; I just want to know under the terms of the plan and\nconsistently with ERISA, could they keep the five\nmillion and in some sequence provide for a merger with\nPACE? And I think you're telling me yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor, subject to\nthe fact that here it's quite possible that the PBGC\nwould consider a transfer of assets and liabilities just\nto leave assets in a plan as a reversion, that they\nwould be subject to that requirement. And so they would\nhave to annuitize the benefits of, of the participants\nin the plan. Because the PBGC would -- would look at\nthat and they would say that looks like an effort just\nto extract assets out of what's really an ongoing plan\nbecause the employer is not going to be participating in\nthat other plan. The -- they are just stripping it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why couldn't the PBGC\nsay, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance\ncompanies work. So we'll buy the annuity and then the\nfive million is an extra guarantee to make sure the\nannuities are paid and that also goes to the insurance\ncompany?\nMR. ROBERTS: If I could answer the\nquestion. The -- the -- they could not -- the plan\nadministrator could decide to give the reversion to the\nemployees and not -- not take a reversion. It could\namend the plan to allow that but the point is it has a\nlegitimate interest in taking the reversion and that\nthat interest encourages plan sponsors to fully fund\ntheir plan, and depriving it of that would prevent them\nfrom that discourage full funding of plans.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Clark.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA P. CLARK,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court. It's notable that neither the\nPetitioner nor the Government in their arguments here\nhas referred at all to the definition of fiduciary in\nERISA. But that is the beginning point of every one of\nthis Court's decisions as to what is a fiduciary\nfunction and what is not. The statute and I'm quoting\nfrom 29 U.S.C., Section 1002(21)(A), it's in the first\npage of the appendix to our brief, is that a person is a\nfiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent that --\nand then it goes on and there are three subparts, two of\nwhich are relevant in this case.\nOne of them and I'm taking them out of order\nbecause I think subpart 3 is the simplest way to resolve\nthis case, \"to the extent that he has any discretionary\nauthority or discretionary responsibility in the\nadministration of the plan.\" The other one that's\nrelevant is subpart 1, which is \"to the extent he\nhas\" -- \"he exercises any authority or control\nrespecting disposition of its assets.\"\nThe reason that the plan administration\nsubpart is the simplest way to resolve this case is that\nCongress in Section 1341 of 29 U.S. Code, and that's\nquoted just immediately below what I was just citing to\nthe Court, specifically assigned to the plan\nadministrator all of the decisions that must be made\nwith respect to implementing the termination of a\npension plan. Throughout that section, everything that\nmust be done is stated specifically to be done by the\nplan administrator.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course this argument\nwould not have any force whatever if indeed,\ntransferring the assets to another plan does not\nconstitute a termination of the plan.\nMS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, that of course\nis the second major issue in the case, and the\nGovernment's attorney admitted that in a two-stage\ntransaction, the assets and liabilities of a plan can be\ntransferred to another plan, and the plan can be\nterminated and assuming the plan provisions are\ncorrectly in place the employer can take the reversion\nof any excess assets. And then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the first step would be\nthe transfer. And at that, at that stage it would not\nbe a termination and therefore it would not be within\nthe authority of the administrator under this provision.\nMS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, the\nimplementation guidelines which the Government attorney\nalso referred to have as their entire focus to make\ncertain that two-part transactions of just the sort that\nyou have referred to are treated as a single whole in\ndetermining whether a plan has been legitimately\nterminated or not. The entire focus of those guidelines\nis, we are not going to permit an employer by separating\nthings out into two parts, first the transfer of assets\nand liabilities, then a termination, to do in form what\nin substance is simply the continuation of the same\nplan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but that still\ndoes not convert the termination decision into, into a,\nan administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's\ndecision.\nMS. CLARK: I agree completely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, you can oversee it\nand make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in\nthe two-step process but the -- but the determination\nwhether to terminate or not is a sponsor's\ndetermination.\nMS. CLARK: I agree completely, Justice\nScalia. There is no question here but that the decision\nto terminate a plan is the plan's sponsor decision. But\nwhen the plan sponsor has made that decision and the\nquestion on the table is how shall we implement that\ndecision to terminate, it does not matter whether that's\ndone through a two-step transaction in which assets are\nfirst transferred to another plan and then the formal\ntermination of what's left remains. The implementation\nguidelines make very clear that you can't tease those\napart and say no, we are only going to look at the final\nstep and that's a termination and nothing else is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they, but they don't\nsay that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly\ntransform the decision whether to, to transfer as -- as\na termination. You transfer that decision from the plan\nsponsor to the administrator.\nMS. CLARK: No, Justice Scalia. The\nimplementation guidelines did not address the question\nof in what capacity these decisions would be made. My\npoint in referring to it is simply to say that it is, it\nis a form over substance argument to say that there is a\ndifference between decision to terminate in which the\nplan administrator then has a choice of implementing it\nby either transferring the assets and liabilities to\nanother plan or purchasing an annuity, versus as the\nGovernment and as the, I mean as the Petitioner would\nhave it, that that's a completely different transaction\nfrom merger as a means of implementing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm puzzled. Can I just\nget myself straightened out a little bit?\nIf there is a decision to terminate you're\nsuggesting, you're suggesting that it's after that\ndecision made, is made, there can be a decision to merge\nwhich would not be a termination?\nMS. CLARK: That is correct, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your, your adversary --\nMS. CLARK: -- that the termination decision\nhas been made.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I disagree with you on\nthat.\nMS. CLARK: I'm sorry; I didn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your adversary takes a\nposition that the merger would be not a termination.\nMS. CLARK: That is what my adversary says.\nAnd if I might focus on the termination section itself,\n29 U.S.C. Section 1341, their position has been that a\nmerger with another plan is completely different from\nthe purchase of annuities to provide those benefits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me that a\nmerger is a continuation rather than a termination. And\nexplain to me why I'm wrong on that.\nMS. CLARK: The Government's regulations on\nsingle employer plan mergers take the very clear\nposition, and we cited them in our brief, it's the\nregulations under Section 414(1), the clear position\nthat any time there is a transfer of assets and\nliabilities from one plan to another, whether a complete\ntransfer or not, that is treated as a spinoff of a plan\nfrom the original plan and a merger of the spun off\nassets and liabilities into the other plan.\nSo that merger is a more flexible concept.\nIt is not just the all-in kind of merger where two plans\nmerge and continue down the road as a single entity.\nMerger also in the Government's own usage describes a\ntransaction in which all or some portion of liabilities\nand all or some portion of assets are separated from the\noriginal plan and transferred to the second plan.\nNow, that being the case, the question\nreally as to whether this is the proposed, the proposal\nof any merger -- and the question presented to the Court\nis in the abstract, is any plan merger an acceptable\nmeans of terminating a plan under Section 1341?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and the\nargument your adversaries make is that termination\nrequires that the plan assets be distributed to the\nbeneficiaries.\nMS. CLARK: Yes, Justice Scalia. That's\nwhat it says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that in the case of a\nmerger the assets are not distributed to the\nbeneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan,\nwhich benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan\nbut the beneficiaries of other plans.\nMS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, we disagree for\nthe following reason. Section 1341 specifically\nprovides that the plan administrator implementing a plan\ntermination may -- and here I'm referring to the\nlanguage that's again in the appendix to our brief; this\nis the last page of that appendix, right at the top --\nplan administrator may purchase irrevocable commitments\nfrom an insurer, that's an insured annuity, to provide\nall benefit liabilities under the plan, or, in\naccordance with provisions of the plan and any\napplicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all\nbenefit liabilities under the plan.\nNow, this Court just last week in James vs.\nUnited States construed a similar statute that had a\nlist of crimes followed by the phrase or otherwise\ninvolves a serious risk of potential harm to persons --\nI'm paraphrasing. I didn't get it exactly right. Both\nthe majority and the dissenting opinion in that case\nagreed that an \"otherwise\" structure of this sort means\nthat what precedes the \"otherwise\" phrase is taken as a\nbaseline against which to judge what follows it, and\nthat it tells you what Congress had in mind as something\nthat satisfies in this case the distribution\nrequirements of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. But now, does\nindeed the transfer here meet the requirement of little\n(i)? Does the transferee plan undertake an irrevocable\ncommitment to provide to these beneficiaries all that\nthey're entitled to, even at the expense of some of the\nother beneficiaries of that plan? In other words, if\nthe plan's investments go south does that plan have the\nauthority to say, oh, you know, our first payments have\nto go to the beneficiaries under this plan that was\ntransferred and the rest of you will get, will get the\nleavings? I don't think that the plan has the authority\nto do that.\nMS. CLARK: Well, Justice Scalia, it does it\nin exactly the same way the purchase of an insurance\npolicy to provide annuities from an insurer does. In\neach case the assets are commingled with the entire\nassets of the financial institution to which these\nliabilities are transferred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought we\njust heard that the PBGC might look at it a little\ndifferently, that they are more comfortable with the\nannuity insuring that these beneficiaries get their\nbenefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries\ninto a pool with your other union members.\nMS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, it's very\nclear that if as we are correct -- I mean, as we argue\nhere, if we're correct that it is a fiduciary\nresponsibility for the plan administrator to select the\noption on the table that is most secure for providing\nthe benefits in the future to the participants, that if\nthe multiemployer plan in question were poorly funded or\nshaky for any other reason and there is a solid\ninsurance company offering an annuity, that the plan\nadministrator would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't this put you\nin an awfully difficult position? I mean, you're\nrepresenting the union, which has other members besides\nthese beneficiaries, and you're saying even though under\ntheir plan the beneficiaries are fully protected with\nirrevocable annuities, we think they're going to be\nbetter off if they're thrown in with our other members\nand we get the $5 million to spread out, not to these\nbeneficiaries but among all these other members. Isn't\nthat an awkward position to be in?\nMS. CLARK: The plan administrator is the\none that ultimately makes the determination. The union\nmay advocate for what it believes to be in the best\ninterest of its members, but the party that makes the\ndecision is the plan administrator wearing a fiduciary\nhat under which it can make no decisions --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would the\nbeneficiaries be better off if there were a merger?\nWhat would their benefit be, as opposed to an annuity?\nMS. CLARK: Probably the single advantage to\nparticipants in a multiemployer plan is portability,\nwhich is to say some of these participants were working\nfor employers that purchased facilities from Crown and\nif their employer participated in the multiemployer plan\nin the future they would be able to add to the benefits\nthat they had accrued and perhaps to reach something\nlike an enhanced benefit at 25 years of service or the\nlike. In terms of advantage to the participant in\ncomparison to an annuity, that would be the major one.\nBut I want to come back to why it is that\nthe multiemployer plan distributes the assets in\nprecisely the same way that the purchase of an annuity\nfrom an insurance company does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it make a commitment,\na commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities\nunder the now deceased plan?\nMS. CLARK: Yes, it does, Justice Scalia.\nThe law requires that. In any plan merger or transfer\nof assets and liabilities from one plan to the other,\nthe fundamental requirement is that all benefits earned\nto the date of the transfer must be protected on both\nsides of the transaction for all participants.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the -- I'm trying to\nwork this out now. Suppose I buy the annuity for these\nemployees from the X insurance company, all right, and\nso the insurance company promises when they retire we'll\npay them a thousand dollars a month. Suppose the\ncompany goes bankrupt. Does the, what is it, the PGPB,\nwhat do you call it, the Pension Guarantee --\nMS. CLARK: PBGC.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Do they pick up any\nof that?\nMS. CLARK: They do not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They do not, okay. So I'm\ntrying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and\nit says: Administrator, you buy the, the annuity from\nan insurance company, for example, or do the same thing,\nget an irrevocable commitment in another permitted form.\nSo one question is when they do that the administrator\ndoesn't have to have any fiduciary thought in his mind.\nThe second position is -- that's their\nposition. The second position is, even if that's so,\nthis is not another permitted form because a merger\nisn't a determination. And the third position is,\nthat's what we were just getting to, is that we don't\nsee any way in which this could help the employee. Now\nyou say, oh yes, there is a way.\nNow suppose we're choosing between two\ninsurance companies. Insurance company A says: We will\npay precisely what is owed, precisely; we're as solid as\na rock. Insurance company B is hungry for business, so\nit says: We'll give those employees exactly what's owed\nand we'll write each of them a check for $500. Now, is\nthat something that means then -- remember, this statute\nsays you have to get what they promised them and not a\npenny more. Is that something that the insurance, the\nadministrator then has to do? He has to take B because\nthe insurance company is promising him a bonus?\nMS. CLARK: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, if not that why\nthis?\nMS. CLARK: No. The Department of Labor has\nmade clear that when making a fiduciary choice among\nannuities that are offered by an insurer, it is the plan\nadministrator's fiduciary duty to look to the security\nof the benefit. That is its sole guiding concern.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And beyond as well?\nI mean, let's say we have 5 million extra dollars here.\nSee, that's what I don't understand. If you're saying\nit's a fiduciary, I mean, how can they make a decision\never to do anything other than just give the five\nmillion to the beneficiaries?\nMS. CLARK: That would depend on the plan,\nMr. Chief Justice. If the plan --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the terms, the\nplans terms here, did not provide for merger in the\nevent of termination, right?\nMS. CLARK: No, we disagree. The district\ncourt determined that they did authorize the merger for\nthis purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other side said that\nthe district court found that the argument was waived,\nor the court of appeals did.\nMS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, it was the court\nof appeals that held that the argument was waived. The\ncourt of appeals said that because this was not\npresented in the bankruptcy court that the argument\nwould not be considered by the court of appeals in\nPetitioner's urging the court of appeals to overturn\nwhat the district court had done.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the\ndistrict court decided it? Usually in a waiver\nsituation it's whether you argued it or whether it was\naddressed by the court.\nMS. CLARK: In this case, I could see a\nreason why that would make sense, because in the\nbankruptcy proceeding both parties presented evidence,\nand the interpretation of a plan document is like\ninterpreting any other contract. You may have the\nopportunity to present evidence on what it means.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're -- if you\nprevail here -- I mean, the reason we have a case is\nbecause the employer overfunded the plan to the tune of\n$5 million. If you prevail and they cannot get that\nback even after fully insuring the benefits for the\nbeneficiaries, employers in the future will be very\ncareful not to put in one penny more than what's\nrequired to fund the plan; isn't that right.\nMS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nbelieve that that's the case, because the funding rules\nof ERISA do encourage employers to fund well at times\nwhen times are good. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you prevail won't\nplan documents or shouldn't plan documents be amended to\nsay that merger is not an option and any reversion goes\nto the employer?\nMS. CLARK: That may well be the case,\nJustice Kennedy. Or they may say whatever the method of\nimplementing the termination that the plan administrator\nchooses, it must provide for a reversion to the\nemployer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What possible\nequitable basis does the union have to claim this extra\n$5 million?\nMS. CLARK: The actual --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not for these\nbeneficiaries. It's for all the others. It's spread\nout among this pool in the multiemployer plan. These\nare the employer excess contributions. What -- looking\nat it as an equitable matter, what claim do they have to\nthe extra money?\nMS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, I could\nanswer that on two levels. One is that the record of\nthis case does not preclude the possibility that this\nwould have been negotiated to leave the reversion for\nthe employer. But that's speculation because, since the\nfiduciary didn't go down that path, we don't know where\nit could have taken it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there a lot of\nplans that look like that, that if there's extra money,\nwe've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not\nback to the company?\nMS. CLARK: It never goes to the union.\nThat would be violation of a different section of\nFederal law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The union plan.\nMS. CLARK: But to a plan. The reason --\nand plans simply don't address this, except for\nauthorize merger --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how could the\nadministrator, how could the administrator negotiate\nwith the employer to give the $5 million back if it's\nwith a fiduciary?\nMS. CLARK: If the employer had said, had\namended the plan to say, whatever you do by way of\nterminating this plan, you must protect our right to the\nreversion, then the plan administrator would have been\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if it\nwould have been amended. But what happens, what happens\nif the employer wants to continue in business, but\nsimply turn the plan over to a multiemployer plan? Is\nthat a fiduciary -- and you have an employer that wears\ntwo hats. The employer is also the administrator. Is\nthat a fiduciary decision?\nMS. CLARK: No, Justice Kennedy, it is not,\nbecause there there really is an impact on the form and\nthe amount of benefits that will be accrued in the\nfuture under an ongoing plan, as well as --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then it's the ongoing\nsignificance of the decision to the employer that\ndetermines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?\nMS. CLARK: No, Justice Kennedy. It's the\nongoing significance to the participants, because then\nwhat you have is truly a plan design decision, which\ndoes not come within plan administration, while in the\ncase of a merger as a means of implementing termination\nthe law fixes those benefits. They are what they are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I can't see why it's a\nfiduciary obligation in case A -- a sponsor obligation\nin case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B. That\njust depends on the sequence of timing.\nMS. CLARK: Again, it's not, it's not the\ntiming. It's the context. In a case like this one,\nwhere the employer is clearly going out of business,\nit's talking termination, it's got annuity quotes on the\ntable, it's, everything is the implementation of the\ntermination of the plan. If instead this employer\nremains in business and is continuing to employ people\nwho are going to be accruing benefits in the future,\nthen that is the question of what are the benefits they\nare going to be accruing in the future.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But what about the\nemployees who are on board at the time the merger\ndecision is made? Are you saying that an, an employer\nwho continues to operate can say, I'm going to merge my\nsound plan, I'm sick of having to worry about it, I'm\ngoing to merge this financially sound plan into plan A\nout here, which is very, very shaky, and I know\nperfectly well that plan A, you know, may very well\ncollapse, but I don't care. I just want to get rid of\nwhat I have. Is that an option for the plan sponsor?\nMS. CLARK: That would be a plan sponsor\ndecision, but the plan sponsor would be subjecting\nitself to obligations for future enhanced funding of the\nplan that it joins.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you go back for just\none second to Justice Alito's question, because that's\nwhat I'm having trouble with, because I think the\nquestion is what, assuming you're right on all the other\npoints for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to\nthe worker here? And the answer I heard you give was\nthe advantage is, well, maybe the worker if he goes and\nworks in the right place will get some more money.\nWell, and I wonder is that relevant. And\nyou told me in respect to the two insurance companies it\nwasn't relevant. So if it isn't relevant in respect to\nthe two insurance companies, how can that be relevant\nhere, and if that isn't relevant here what is the\npossible advantage to the worker?\nMS. CLARK: Justice Breyer, I believe I was\ncut off and didn't finish my answer to your question\nwhen you asked it before. In determining which of two\nannuities on the table are to be chosen, the Department\nof Labor's instructions to employers have clearly said\nif they're equal on the basis of safety and security of\nthe benefits, then it's appropriate for the fiduciary to\ntake other considerations into account. So our position\nhere would be that, by parallel to that, if the\nfiduciary were to conclude that the multiemployer plan\nis of equal safety and security to the participants\nbenefits that they have earned to date, it would then be\nable to take into consideration in the interest of\nparticipants any other difference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then you're saying that\nthe answer -- we have annuity company A and B, they're\nidentical, the worker has a pension that promises them\n$1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says,\nwe'll give you $500 extra. Then in your opinion under\nthe current regs and so forth, the administrator must\nchoose that company; is that right?\nMS. CLARK: Only if the two companies are\nequivalent in terms of their security.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I said they are equivalent\nin terms of -- of the security and so forth; they are\neach good companies and one will write out a check for\n$500, which is what I thought my example was. And now\nyou're saying under the law the fiduciary must choose\nthe first but you're hesitating on that which means I\nthink I don't understand it fully.\nMS. CLARK: I'm trying to make sure that I\nunderstand your question fully, Justice Breyer.\nThe, the choice must be made and the\nDepartment of Labor's instructions to employers are very\nclear on this, in the interest of the security of those\nbenefits which have been accrued, that's the guiding\nprinciple, (i) single to the rights and interests of the\nbeneficiaries. If they are equal, then the Department\nof Labor guidelines permit the fiduciary to take other\nfactors into consideration. So that the first decision\nhas to be made in terms of the security of those\nbenefits that the individual has already earned.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think, I just\ndon't read 1341 the way you do. It seems to me that\nlittle (i) at the top of your page 2a is a safe harbor.\nI don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary\ndecision that he has to, once he has found an insurer\nthat is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the\nbenefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look\nthroughout the rest of the world to see if there is\nanything that might be better for his plan participants.\nI think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an\nirrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that\ninsurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home\nfree. You're saying he is not home free. He has to\nconsider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully\nproviding all benefit liabilities might be better for\nthe plan participants. I -- I think that's, that's\nplacing on him an obligation that I don't see there.\nMS. CLARK: Well, Justice Scalia, a safe\nharbor doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't\nappropriate for the fiduciary to consider other\nalternatives. It would mean I believe if he chooses an\nannuity that is a safe and secure way to provide the\nbenefit and is equally good with anything else, he would\nbe solidly protected from any challenge that a\nparticipant might make.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- excuse me. Excuse\nme. I'm just not sure I understand your answer.\nIf the employer finds the rock solid\ninsurance company under -- pardon me, the administrator\nfinds the rock solid insurance company under Justice\nScalia's hypothetical under (i) he must consider all\nother options under (ii)?\nMS. CLARK: If -- if options have been\nproposed and they are of equal or better security for\nthe participants, yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you're saying in this\ncase, this is sort of the square one question that I\nwant to be clear on. You're saying in this case simply\nthat the employer had to give consideration to PACE's\nproposal rather than cutting off consideration, we\npresume in part, because of the issue of the $5 million.\nIt had to think about it some more. Is that correct?\nMS. CLARK: Yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your little\n(ii) that you're relying on begins by saying in\naccordance with the provisions of the plan, the other\nsolution otherwise provides. Where in the provisions of\nthe plan does it say that they will consider merger?\nMS. CLARK: That was what the district court\nfound, that the provisions of the plan authorized the\nmerger, as an option.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know, is\nthere a particular provision in the plan that says that?\nOr --\nMS. CLARK: The district court cited what it\nwas relying on; I don't have those at my fingertips.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it specific in the\nplan or it just didn't exclude, the plan didn't exclude\nthe possibility of merger?\nMS. CLARK: Well -- the usual reading of a\nterm in accordance with means that it must not violate.\nIt must be consistent with the terms of that plan.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that could be if they\njust didn't say anything so it would be a choice. Just\nlike it doesn't say, may not say anything about a lump\nsum, which would be an alternative. But your point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't read in\naccordance with the way you do. I read in accordance\nwith to mean provided by the plan.\nMS. CLARK: Certainly if the plan has a\nprovision then it must be followed. If the plan is\nsilent, Mr. Chief Justice, your -- your question\nsuggests that there must be an affirmative authorization\nin the plan. The district court found there was\nsufficient authorization here in whatever form that the\ndistrict court found satisfactory. And because that\nissue was not raised in a bankruptcy court there was no\nopportunity to present evidence on that matter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand that your\nposition is twofold? One is you say you -- you put this\non the table, the board was bound to consider it with\ntheir fiduciary hat. So it's not just that they were to\nconsider it. But they had to consider it as a fiduciary\nand not as a sponsor?\nMS. CLARK: Precisely, Justice Ginsburg.\nNow, I have -- my time is up. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Ms. Clark.\nMr. Baker, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BAKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'm going to turn -- cover a couple points on function\nand then turn to the statutory question.\nFirst, I would like to return the Court to\nthe factual context of this case. In this case, PACE\nmade not a two-step proposal, PACE proposed an outright\nmerger in which all assets and liabilities would be\ntransferred to the PACE union. That's in the record.\nIt's Plaintiff's trial Exhibit 25. And what's\nsignificant about the merger proposal that PACE sent to\nCrown is that this is PACE's merger proposal. It had\nCrown signing the merger in Crown's planned sponsor\ncapacity not as a, not as an administrator but as a plan\nsponsor. That's what PACE proposed, recognizing that\nthe decision whether to merge the plan was a plan\nsponsor function.\nI'd like to turn now to the question of the,\nalso the second stage issue here. Even, even if this\nwas a two-stage transaction, which was not proposed,\neach stage of that transaction is a plan sponsor\ndecision. A plan sponsor has to make the decision\nwhether to transfer assets and then a plan sponsor has\nto make the decision whether or not to then terminate\nthe plan. Each separate stage is a plan sponsor\nfunction.\nIn terms of the plan sponsor function\nchanging because the company is going out of business,\nthat simply cannot be. A plan sponsor function depends\nupon what the function is, and it doesn't matter whether\nthe business is going out of business or whether the\nbusiness is an ongoing concern. If anything, because\nit's going out of business, it's important to protect\nthe, the discretion of a plan sponsor.\nIn terms of the contextual argument it's\nvery important to note that nowhere -- that Section 1341\nwhich governs standard termination does not\ncross-reference mergers and the Section 1412 governing\nmergers does not apply to terminations. In fact the\nonly place in the statute where the two words appear\ntogether is in Section 1058, in which the two procedures\nare actually compared to each other.\nThere are some significant differences\nbetween termination and merger. In a termination, there\nis a reversion to the company. There is also reversion\nto employees based upon their individual contributions.\nThere is no similar reversion in a merger. That is why\na merger simply cannot be a method of termination. The\ntwo are different. You might have a two-stage\ntransaction but they are two separate transactions each\nof which is a plan sponsor function.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I understand\nwhat you mean by a reversion to the employees who have\nmade contributions. They get their cash back?\nMR. BAKER: Yes. If employees, under 1334,\nif employees have made individual contributions to the\nplan, it's not merely paid for by the employer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BAKER: -- the employee has a right to a\npro rata percentage of the surplus plan assets in the\nevent of termination. There is no similar right of\nreversion to the employee in the event of a merger.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the plan, the plan\nprovides that in the event of a merger there will in\nfact be a reversion to the employees, if they've paid in\ntoo much or to, or to the sponsor if the sponsor has\noverfunded, and there will be no merger except on those\nterms? Is that enforceable?\nMR. BAKER: I'm not sure I -- I understand\nyour question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the plan document says\nlook, if we decide to merge, anybody who has paid in\nmore than he has to, employee or employer, gets the\nmoney back or there's no merger. In other words it's\ngoing to be the terms of the merger that there is a\nreversion. Can a plan provide for that?\nMR. BAKER: A plan cannot provide for that\nbecause it would be contrary to ERISA, Justice Souter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
