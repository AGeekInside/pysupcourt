        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-1371, Missouri v. Seibert.\nMs. Mitchell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN K. MITCHELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MITCHELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMiranda's core ruling is that an unwarned\nstatement may not be used in the prosecution's case in\nchief to prove guilt. In this case, the prosecution did\nnot seek to admit an unwarned statement, rather the\nstatement that was offered was preceded by a meticulous\nrecitation of Miranda warnings, an express waiver of\nrights, and was the product of non-coercive questioning.\nA fully warned and otherwise voluntary statement\nis not tainted by the existence of a prior unwarned\nstatement even if the officer intentionally initiated\nquestioning without warning and that is true for two\nreasons.\nFirst, because an officer's intent does not\nrender the unwarned statement actually involuntary. The\nunwarned statement is merely presumptively compelled, and\nonce warnings are administered, that presumption ends and\nthe suspect has the information necessary to make a\nknowing and intelligent decision about waiver.\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt? You say the\nsecond warning removes the presumption as to the earlier\nunwarned statement. Why?\nMS. MITCHELL: Going forward, Your Honor, yes.\nQUESTION: Going forward, but not going\nbackward.\nMS. MITCHELL: No. No, Your Honor. Only going\n-- it -- it ends the presumption at that --\nQUESTION: So that you still have the\npresumption that the earlier statement was involuntary.\nMS. MITCHELL: Yes, Your Honor. It ends the\npresumption that that -- at that point going forward\nbecause it provides the --\nQUESTION: And is that true if the -- if the\nconversation after the warnings includes interrogation\nabout what he said before?\nMS. MITCHELL: It would depend on how that\nhappened, but under the facts of this case, yes, it would\nstill remain true.\nThere are essentially -- under Miranda, there\nare two elements that we have to look at in determining\nwhether a statement is admissible, and that is whether you\nhave a knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver and whether\nthe statement is in fact voluntary. If there is a\nreference back, as there was in this case to the previous\nstatement, it could be a problem if that is part of the\nwaiver element. And I believe that's what this Court\nindicated in Elstad itself. If the officer used that in a\nway that affected the knowing nature then of what the --\nthe information that was imparted and made the waiver\ntherefore defective, it may be problematic. However, as\nin this case, where there's simply a reference back during\nthe -- the questioning, after there is a waiver and a\ndecision to go forward, that alone does not affect the\nvoluntariness of that subsequent statement.\nQUESTION: Would it -- would it affect it if the\nofficer said, now, an hour ago you told me X? Were you\ncorrect in saying that or not? Would that be permissible?\nMS. MITCHELL: I think so. After the decision\nhas been made to waive and the individual has decided to\nproceed forward and talk, I believe that's correct, Your\nHonor, because --\nQUESTION: No, please finish.\nMS. MITCHELL: -- because it does not -- it is\nnot sufficient to overbore the individual's will, which is\nthe question at that point because we're at the voluntary\nanalysis at that point.\nQUESTION: The difficulty I have with the\nargument is the premise that you state -- is in accepting\nthe premise that you state, and that is that a second\ninterrogation that falls on the heels of the first --\nhere, I think there was a 20-minute break -- can really be\nseparated as a matter of simple psychology. I -- I have\ndifficulty in accepting the plausibility of a conclusion\nthat the -- that the ostensible waiver in the second case\nis really a free waiver as distinct from sort of throwing\nup one's hands and saying it's too late to say no now.\nIt's the -- it -- there's a basic implausibility in your\ncase. What -- what can you offer on that point?\nMS. MITCHELL: Well, first, Elstad addressed\nthat exact issue and came to the opposite conclusion.\nQUESTION: But -- but Elstad -- I mean, let me\n-- and maybe that's the way I should have focused the\ncase. In -- in Elstad, you did not have a -- let's say, a\n-- a systematic questioning of the -- of the sort that\nwent on here. Here the -- the police did, indeed, engage\nin a kind of first-round interrogation, and the -- the\nintensity of their pressure to get answers in this case\nseems to me qualitatively different from Elstad.\nMS. MITCHELL: It is different, Your Honor.\nThere clearly is a continuum. But the appropriate\nquestion is whether the first statement was involuntary or\nnot. If in fact that questioning and that pressure had\nbeen great enough to make that first statement\ninvoluntary, then absolutely it would create the kind of\ntaint that could carry forward even after subsequent\nwarnings were given. I think that is the lesson of\nElstad.\nBut Elstad draws that distinction between actual\ncoercion and presumptive coercion, and where it is merely\npresumptive -- it does not rise to the level of actual --\nthen that does not carry forward.\nQUESTION: But that's -- comparatively speaking,\nI -- I think maybe that was -- that was relatively easy to\ntell in Elstad. Here, it's going to be a serious issue,\nand it seems to me that in order to litigate this issue as\nthe threshold issue to determining whether the second\nwaiver or as part of the litigation as to whether the --\nthe ostensible waiver really is a waiver and the second\nstatement really is voluntary, we're right back in the\nmorass of litigation, which is one of the principal\nobjects of Miranda to avoid in the first place. We -- we\nsaid, look, this -- this litigation is very difficult.\nIt's difficult to engage in this litigation and produce a\n-- a clear and reliable answer. It seems to me that --\nthat the position you take forces us right back into that\nlitigation position that we tried to get away from in\nMiranda itself.\nMS. MITCHELL: Well, two observations on that,\nYour Honor.\nFirst, the Court has not really ever gotten away\nfrom the totality of the circumstances analysis. The\nCourt has continued to employ it as the primary\nanalysis --\nQUESTION: But you want us to wade deeper.\nYou're -- you're absolutely right. There's -- there's no\n-- there's no easy way. But your way would make it more\ndifficult. Your -- your way would promote litigation,\nwouldn't it?\nMS. MITCHELL: I -- I don't know that I agree\nwith that because I don't see this as different from where\nyou are in Harris where you still have to do a full-blown\nanalysis of voluntariness. It is somewhat different than\nthe two-prong analysis that is done in every case where\nvoluntariness is at issue because you have the warnings\nand then, arguably, the totality of the circumstances\nanalysis is somewhat easier. But, nevertheless, in a\nsituation such as Harris, where you're making on the front\nend a determination on voluntariness, I think it is very,\nvery similar to what -- what we are suggesting here.\nQUESTION: Ms. Mitchell, do you take the\nposition that we have to conduct a voluntariness inquiry\nin -- as to the second statement --\nMS. MITCHELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- after the warnings were given?\nMS. MITCHELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: You agree with that.\nMS. MITCHELL: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And in doing that, do you think that\nthe officer's use of the initial confession to get the\ndefendant to admit what went on is irrelevant to that\nvoluntariness inquiry --\nMS. MITCHELL: I would not --\nQUESTION: -- or just that it isn't sufficient\nto determine the outcome?\nMS. MITCHELL: I think it --\nQUESTION: What -- what is your position\nexactly?\nMS. MITCHELL: I think it is not sufficient to\ndetermine the outcome. I would not say it is irrelevant.\nQUESTION: But it is relevant in the inquiry.\nMS. MITCHELL: I would not say it's irrelevant\nbecause I think, as the Court has looked at totality of\nthe circumstances and what is necessary to show coercion,\nbasically the Court has looked, I believe, at two\nelements: the conduct of the officer and if it is\ncoercive, and the effect on the individual considering\ntheir personality, character traits, and so forth. In\nElstad, when -- in talking about the effect of the cat out\nof the bag on the individual, the Court talked about some\nsubjective disadvantage that the individual might have,\nand so I suppose that type of analysis could lump that\nwithin the characteristics of the individual that the\nCourt would look at in determining a totality of the\ncircumstances analysis.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't -- I don't understand\nyour -- your position on that point. It -- it seems to me\nthat if there has been no coercion in the first\nconfession, how could -- how could it possibly be relevant\nto whether the second confession is voluntary, whether\nthere had been a prior admission?\nMS. MITCHELL: I don't think it can control,\nYour Honor, and I don't --\nQUESTION: I didn't say control. How could it\npossibly be relevant? Unless you're saying what is\nrelevant is whether Miranda was observed, which has\nnothing to do with whether it was necessarily involuntary.\nMS. MITCHELL: And I suppose I would draw the\ndistinction between the questioning and the answer, which\nI think is a distinction this Court drew in Elstad as\nwell. I don't think the questioning is relevant at all to\nthe subsequent statement, and certainly I would agree with\nwhat you're saying. When there's no coercion, it should\nnot -- there's no taint that carries forward.\nBut if it is to be considered at all -- and\nperhaps it shouldn't be, but in a totality of the\ncircumstances analysis, if there is a reference back and\nthe Court wants to consider that as part of the totality,\nit seems to me the Court might look at from the\nperspective of whether it in some way affects the\nindividual.\nQUESTION: What -- what you're inviting courts\nto do is to say, well, he wouldn't have made the second\nconfession had he not made the first one which was\nunwarned under Miranda and therefore the second one is\nalso presumptively -- that's what you're inviting.\nMS. MITCHELL: I don't think so. That -- that\nfact alone could never carry the day, and I think that was\nmade very, very clear in Elstad where that was --\nQUESTION: Of course, it can't carry the day,\nbut it's -- it's one of the totality of the circumstances.\nRight?\nMS. MITCHELL: Correct. But just the reference\nback I don't believe makes it any -- really affects it or\nmakes it any -- any different than the fact that the cat\nhas already been let out of the bag --\nQUESTION: May I ask you just a broader\nquestion? Is there anything -- if your submission is\ncorrect, is there any reason why a police department\nshould not adopt a policy that said, never give Miranda\nwarnings until a suspect confesses?\nMS. MITCHELL: I think -- I think there are lots\nof reasons why -- why police departments would not do\nthat.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMS. MITCHELL: There is a risk associated with\ntaking this type of an approach, and as our officer\nindicated here, he was rolling the dice. He did not\nindicate that he did this in every single interrogation\nhe -- he --\nQUESTION: So what has he got to lose is what I\nhave to understand. Because if the -- if he doesn't\nconfess anyway, you haven't lost anything. He wouldn't\nhave confessed with the Miranda warning. If he does\nconfess, then you've got a shot at getting it in after\ngiving him the Miranda warning.\nMS. MITCHELL: What --\nQUESTION: Why would you not -- why would you\nnot always adopt that policy?\nMS. MITCHELL: Well, what officers want when\nthey do an interrogation generally is an admissible\nstatement for all purposes, not for some limited purpose.\nAnd so what they are looking for is to maximize that\npossibility, and they know that -- that the vast majority\nof people, according to studies, percentage-wise do in\nfact waive and give a statement. What they risk then is,\nby not giving the warnings on the front end, is that that\nalone will become a factor in the analysis in determining\nwhether or not that first statement was voluntary. If\nthe --\nQUESTION: But not if you get the rule that --\nthat you're asking for here, other than this factor.\nAnd then that gets back to the question I want\nto ask and I think it bears on what you're telling Justice\nStevens. Can you tell me what relevance, what weight,\nwhat significance do we attach to an earlier unwarned\nstatement?\nMS. MITCHELL: In and of --\nQUESTION: It is a factor in the totality of the\ncircumstances? Is that -- is that what you're telling us?\nMS. MITCHELL: No. What I'm saying is in this\n-- as in this case, where there is a reference back, I\nthink the Court could look at that as one factor when it's\ndetermining totality of the circumstances and whether the\nstatement is voluntary or not. Just the fact that there\nhad been previous interrogation or previous questioning\nwithout warnings in and of itself I do not believe, under\nany circumstances, could carry forward.\nQUESTION: When you say reference back, Ms.\nMitchell, you mean the interrogator refers back to the --\nMS. MITCHELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- earlier statement.\nMS. MITCHELL: As occurred in this case.\nQUESTION: And the reference back could cause it\n-- could cause the later statement to be involuntary\nbecause?\nMS. MITCHELL: Well, I don't think it would\ncause the -- the statement to be involuntary in and of\nitself, but --\nQUESTION: I know not in and of itself, but it\n-- it tends to show that the prior statement -- that the\nlater statement is involuntary. Unless it tends to show\nthat, it's irrelevant. Now, why is it that it tends to\nshow that?\nMS. MITCHELL: I think if the Court were to\nconsider that, it would be one factor bearing on how the\nother circumstances or other parts of the police conduct\naffected that individual because in the analysis in\nElstad, the Court looked at this question of the effect on\nthe individual of having spoken before. So it would not\nbe the -- the previous questioning because that --\nQUESTION: The -- the only way it could have any\nbearing, it seems to me, is that the person would have\nsaid, what the heck, I've already coughed it up, I may as\nwell -- I may as well do it again. And you think that\nthat makes the second one involuntary.\nMS. MITCHELL: I don't think that makes the\nsecond --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think it does either.\nMS. MITCHELL: I don't --\nQUESTION: And if it doesn't, I don't see how it\ncan at all be relevant.\nMS. MITCHELL: Well, Your Honor, if the Court is\nlooking at the totality of the circumstances, what we're\nsaying is that may be one circumstance the --\nQUESTION: When we said totality of the\ncircumstances, I -- I had always thought we meant totality\nof the relevant circumstances, you know, not whether it's\na Tuesday afternoon or not.\nQUESTION: Is time relevant? Suppose as soon as\nthe officers got what they wanted from Mrs. Seibert, they\ndidn't give her a 20-minute break to have a cigarette,\nthey said, fine, we got it. Now we're going to redo your\nMiranda rights nice and slow and then go right on with the\nquestions. Is there any significance to the time and\nplace? That is, she was -- she was in the same room with\nthe same officers.\nMS. MITCHELL: Correct.\nQUESTION: Suppose it had been one continuous\nepisode, but in the middle of it, they gave her Miranda\nwarnings.\nMS. MITCHELL: We do not believe that that would\nmake any difference, Your Honor. As this Court indicated\nin Elstad, a waiver that is otherwise voluntary and\nknowing is not ineffective for some specific period of\ntime simply because there was prior interrogation.\nQUESTION: It's -- it's simply that the closer\nthe interrogation, the less likely that there is in fact a\nvoluntary waiver.\nMS. MITCHELL: I don't believe so, Your Honor,\nbecause what -- what you're looking at to determine if\nthere's a voluntary waiver is whether the individual had\nthe information, specifically the legal information, they\nneeded to make a decision. That is giving them their\nwarnings and -- and in a way that clearly communicates\ntheir rights to them, and then they have an opportunity to\nmake a decision.\nQUESTION: No, but it's -- it's more than simply\na -- I mean, there's -- there's no question that the --\nthat the crucial element is a decision made with\nappreciation of legal rights. But the other crucial\nelement is that the decision to waive them be voluntary.\nMS. MITCHELL: Correct.\nQUESTION: And it seems to me the closer you are\nto the prior statement, the closer you are to saying to\nyourself, what have I got left to waive? Sure, I'll go\nahead. I've already done it.\nMS. MITCHELL: I think --\nQUESTION: And -- and that's not a -- that's not\na function of -- of knowledge of law. It's a function of\nproximity to the prior statement.\nMS. MITCHELL: Well, two things on that. I\nthink Elstad indicated strongly that time was not\nrelevant. It would be relevant if we were doing an\nattenuation analysis, but we're not because there wasn't\nunderlying coercive conduct, one.\nTwo, I think if you look at cases such as Bayer,\nthis Court has indicated that, you know, once the cat is\nout of the bag, the cat is out of the bag. And perhaps,\nif you want to look at it that way, it always has some\nlingering effect, but that is not sufficient to make the\nsecond statement involuntary. So how long that break\nis --\nQUESTION: Do you know -- do you know why we --\nwe have the common phrase, I think I'll sleep on it? We\nhave that phrase because we're -- we're likely to make a\n-- a more intelligent decision if we have more time.\nIsn't that true?\nMS. MITCHELL: But on the other hand, Your\nHonor, I think this could be more equated to buyer remorse\nwhere someone has done something and they thought, wow, I\nwish I hadn't done that. And then they're told exactly\nwhat their rights are, and it's like, wow, okay, I have an\nopportunity to change what I have just done. And that's\nwhat I think really is going on here when the warnings are\nread to the individual, and so, no, I do not believe that\nthe passage of time is relevant.\nIf there are no other questions at this time.\nQUESTION: That -- you're reserving your time,\nMs. Mitchell?\nMS. MITCHELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn officer's failure to give Miranda warnings\nbefore taking an initial statement does not presumptively\ntaint the admissibility of a subsequent statement that has\nbeen preceded by Miranda warnings and an express waiver of\nMiranda rights. And the reason is that the risk of\ncompulsion that is inherent in unwarned custodial\ninterrogation and that makes the first statement\ninadmissible is counteracted once Miranda warnings have\nbeen given.\nQUESTION: May I ask whether you -- you to\ncomment on one -- what if we required that the second\nwarning include a statement that you realize what you said\nup to now would be inadmissible in your trial?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That is exactly the requirement\nthat this Court rejected in Elstad, and the only\ndifference between this case and in Elstad identified by\nthe Missouri Supreme Court is that here the initial\nfailure to warn was intentional. And the -- the fact of\nintentionality adds nothing to the level of compulsion\nthat is experienced by the suspect during the initial\ninterrogation. It adds nothing to the psychological force\nthat operates on the suspect who has confessed once as a\nresult of unwarned -- during unwarned questioning and the\ngiving and subsequent administration of Miranda warnings\nis no less effective in providing the information that is\nnecessary to make a knowing and voluntary decision --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's what's not clear to\nme, that -- that -- it seems to me you're absolutely on\nthe right track in saying that Miranda has, as one of its\nbasic purposes, dealing with cases where there may or may\nnot be compulsion. We're not sure. And this gets rid of\nthe risk, so that that's a very good way of describing it.\nAnd then it seems to me in this kind of case we\nhave two risks. One was the risk that really it was\ncompelled -- the first statement. And second is the risk\nthat really that first statement does lead to the second\nconfession.\nAnd so to obviate those risks, would it make\nsense to say in any case where the police knowingly or\nreasonably should have known they're supposed to give\nMiranda warnings in the first case, you can use the second\nstatement but only if the government shows that, first of\nall, that first one wasn't compelled? Second, it shows\nthat the Miranda warning was given before the second. And\nthird, it shows that a time has to have elapsed sufficient\nto make that Miranda warning reasonable, reasonably\ncutting the causal connection that you want it to cut.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Because start with Elstad which\nrejected any requirement of a break. And -- and Elstad\nalso said that the risk of compulsion that is inherent in\nthe initial interrogation and that makes that inadmissible\nis counteracted once the Miranda warnings have been given,\nwhether or not there has been a significant break between\nthe initial and the second interrogation.\nNow let me address your question about\nreasonable and knowing and whether that should make a\ndifference. The fact that the warnings were known, that\n-- that this was a custodial interrogation situation, the\nfact that the officer may have been unreasonable in\nthinking it was not -- neither of those adds anything to\nthe level of compulsion that is experienced by the suspect\nduring the initial --\nQUESTION: It does not. You're right, but what\nit does do is provide a tremendous incentive for the\npolice to run around the Miranda warning, and when they\nrun around it, we could get back, if they do it enough,\ninto the circumstances before Miranda that were bad\ncircumstances and called for Miranda.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But the difference between this\nsituation and Miranda is that what Miranda addressed was a\nsituation where you were relying solely on a voluntariness\ninquiry to determine whether the statements that were\nadmitted were compelled. And the Court has determined\nthat there is an unacceptable risk in that situation when\nall you're relying on is the totality of the circumstances\nthat a compelled statement will be admitted. In this\nsituation, you are not relying --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, I --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- totally on the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, I -- Miranda, whatever\nit has become, has all over it inform at once, and what\nwe're talking now is, no, Miranda isn't inform at once at\nall. It's -- it can be. Don't inform until, until you've\ngotten enough, and then. Now, that seems to me quite a\ndifferent thing. Anyone reading the Miranda decision\nsays, oh, yes, these are the things the police are\nsupposed to say up front. And now you're saying, no, it\ndoesn't really mean that at all. It means don't inform of\nyour rights until, somewhere in midstream.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, how I -- how I\nwould describe it is that you are required to give Miranda\nwarnings if the government is going to be able to\nintroduce this -- the statements as substantive evidence\nof the defendant's guilt.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Gornstein, you're just\nmaking a different compelled inquiry. Now you're not\nasking whether the warned statement was compelled, but\nyou're asking in every case whether the earlier statement\nwas compelled so that you'd have the police have a policy\nof always refusing to give warning, but say, well, don't\nquestion him for more than 8 or 9 hours or something like\nthat because you run the risk of compulsion. But it seems\nto me you're going to get that same factual inquiry with\nrespect to the earlier statement that Miranda was designed\nto prevent -- to avoid with respect to the later\nstatement.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But the difference, Justice\nStevens, is that -- that yes, there will be inquiry into\nthe voluntariness of the first statement and the second\nstatement, but the difference is that the only statement\nthat is being admitted is the second statement. And\nthat's --\nQUESTION: But you -- you agree that's\ninadmissible if the earlier one was compelled.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, not automatically\ninadmissible if it was compelled, Justice Stevens. There\nwould be a --\nQUESTION: Oh, I misunderstood you.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. That would be presumptively\ntaint -- it would presumptively taint the subsequent\nstatement and then you would look to the --\nQUESTION: No. I'm -- I'm assuming it's clear\nfrom the evidence the first statement was not merely\npresumptively compelled but actually compelled.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. What I'm saying --\nQUESTION: Would it not automatically follow the\nsecond would be inadmissible?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. Then -- then the situation,\nJustice Stevens, is you would look to a taint analysis to\nsee whether other additional factors cured the initial\ncompulsion and made the second statement voluntary.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But what -- what I -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: No. Please finish your answer.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I just wanted to get this\none -- one thing answered which is that when you are\nlooking at the second statement and admitting it, you --\nit is a statement that has been preceded by Miranda\nwarnings. There is an express waiver of Miranda rights.\nThere's a finding of voluntariness of the first, a finding\nof voluntariness of the second, and as to that statement\nat that point, there simply is not an unacceptable risk\nthat that statement has been compelled.\nAnd on the other hand, there is a serious cost\nto the administration of justice when you exclude from the\njury's consideration what -- a statement that is warned\nand voluntary and very highly probative evidence of the\ndefendant's guilt.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, you in -- in the\nanswer you just finished giving and I think throughout\nyour argument, you were making -- I think you were making\nthe assumption that there are two inquiries that should be\nmade in the situation that you envision. One is the\nvoluntariness of the first statement, the unwarned\nstatement. Second is the voluntariness of the second\nstatement, following the warnings. Do you agree that\nthere is a third inquiry and that is the voluntariness of\nthe waiver?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There has to be an inquiry into\nthe -- there has to be a knowing and intelligent waiver.\nThat is for sure. And if the officer does anything to\npressure the suspect, as the Court said in Elstad, to\nforce a waiver, then that would invalidate the subsequent\nstatement.\nQUESTION: And -- and don't you think that the\n-- the situation presented by this kind of case -- for\npurposes of -- of judging the voluntariness of the waiver,\ndon't you think that the situation presented by this kind\nof case is significantly different from the situation\npresented by Elstad? Because Elstad did not involve a\nsystematic interrogation. This did. Isn't it fairly true\nto say as a general rule that following a systematic\ninterrogation, there is less likelihood of a truly\nvoluntary waiver of the right to silence than in the\nElstad situation?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I -- I think what is fair\nto say is if it has crossed over into compulsion, yes.\nBut if all there is is a risk of compulsion and -- and\nthat's what makes the first statement inadmissible, then\nwhether or not there's a greater risk in the second\nsituation of compulsion than the first --\nQUESTION: I'm trying to keep it simpler. I --\nI grant you that if there was compulsion, the risk is\ngreater. I'm -- I'm suggesting that without having to get\ninto the question and making a final determination of\nwhether we're going to label the first statement a subject\nof compulsion or not, isn't the very fact that there has\nbeen a systematic interrogation in a case like this a fact\nthat makes it less likely, not more likely, that the --\nthat the Miranda waiver, when it comes, will not be a\nvoluntary waiver?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The longer the interrogation,\nthat makes it relevant to the inquiry. But once Miranda\nwarnings have been given, that is sufficient to cure any\nrisk of compulsion no matter how high.\nQUESTION: It's -- it's -- but that's -- you're\n-- you're getting to question three again. I'm talking\nabout question two --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm sorry. Then I think that\nthe --\nQUESTION: -- the likelihood of a voluntary\nwaiver.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. I --\nQUESTION: We've got to -- we've got to touch\nthat base before we ask the question about compulsion.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMs. Bartholow. Is that correct?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY M. BARTHOLOW\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to get directly to what Justice Souter\njust mentioned, that when there's a systematic\ninterrogation, things are different.\nQUESTION: What do you mean by a systematic\ninterrogation?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, I think what Elstad said\nand why this situation is so much different from Elstad is\nthat it cited cases where there had been a systematic\ninterrogation where there was a deliberate elicitation of\nquestions --\nQUESTION: I -- I realize there may be cases,\nbut how about you defining what you mean by a systematic\ninterrogation?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: When police officers\ndeliberately elicit incriminating statements from a\nsuspect, then --\nQUESTION: In other -- it -- it doesn't have to\ngo over any period of time?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I don't believe -- I don't\nbelieve time is the critical factor.\nQUESTION: Isn't that the whole point of\ninterrogation, is to elicit statements?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Not in all circumstances, and I\n-- I think sometimes, especially what the Missouri Supreme\nCourt said there's a risk to this practice. For instance,\nwhen officers engage in this practice to locate physical\nevidence, that wouldn't necessarily be a problem for the\nMissouri Supreme Court.\nBut in Elstad, this Court cited, for instance,\nUnited States v. Pierce out of the Fourth Circuit and for\nthe proposition that the more in the without more test of\nElstad -- the more would be a thorough custodial\ninterrogation at the station house. That would provide\nmore, where there's a simple failure to administer\nwarnings without more --\nQUESTION: And -- and why should that be? It\nseems to me that perhaps underlying your position is that\nyou want us to say that there's simply more likelihood\nthat there's going to be a statement after the Miranda\nwarning if there's been a -- for your -- to use your term,\na systematic interrogation before. I'm -- I'm not sure\nthat we have the empirical data to say that the defendant\nwould be more likely to talk after he's been questioned\nand the Miranda warning comes late.\nIs that what is behind your -- your argument?\nAnd if so, is -- is that something on which we can act?\nSuppose that he is more likely to give a statement after\nthere's been a systematic interrogation. So what, if it's\nnot coerced?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, Your Honor, the -- in\nElstad, this Court cited Westover which the cardinal fact\nof Westover, as you said in Mosley, was that the failure\nof police officers to give any warnings whatsoever to the\nperson in custody before embarking on an intense and\nprolonged interrogation of him would result in coercion.\nQUESTION: So -- so what we're -- so what we're\nconcerned about is the fact of coercion. Nothing --\nnothing more?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I think in this case you have\ncoercion, but I think --\nQUESTION: Let's talk about the -- as a general\nrule.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: No.\nQUESTION: So all we're talking about is the\nrisk of coercion, or are we talking about preserving the\n-- the integrity of Miranda by not circumventing it, et\ncetera?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: All of those. I think you're\nconcerned about the risk of coercion.\nQUESTION: Well, but I thought Miranda was only\nconcerned with coercion.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: No. The -- Miranda was --\nQUESTION: As an end -- as an end result.\nObviously, it's a prophylactic rule.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Miranda was certainly concerned\nabout the risk of compelling statements being -- and also\nbeing admitted at trial. That was a main concern of\nMiranda.\nBut I -- I think what we're talking about here\nis whether the waiver was voluntary and whether the second\nstatement was voluntary and the risk of subjecting a\nsuspect to lengthy, intense custodial interrogation. We\ncannot presume that the waiver and subsequent statement\nwas --\nQUESTION: But -- but can you tell me why that\nis? Is he afraid that he'll be beaten -- or she in this\ncase -- or has the will be broken down so that the\ndecision is a little more clouded and -- and it would have\nbeen clearer to the person if the warning had been given\nat the outset? These are -- these are matters of\npsychology that Elstad told us that we really should not\nbe speculating about.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, Miranda -- and in\nDickerson it cited this portion of Miranda where it said\ncustodial interrogations by their very nature generate\ncompelling pressures which work to undermine the\nindividual's will to resist and compel him to speak when\nhe wouldn't otherwise do so freely.\nQUESTION: The question I think -- or at least\nmine is that if you're talking psychology, the policeman\nwho knows from nothing, never heard of Miranda,\naccidentally says, did you commit the fire? Yes. Okay?\nThat statement doesn't come in. And then later on he asks\nit again after the right warning. That's case one.\nCase two. The policeman, knowing everything\nabout Miranda, thinks to himself, ha, ha, ha, I've got a\ngreat trick here. Did you commit the crime, the fire?\nYes. And then later on he asks him the question again\nafter warnings.\nIn terms of the psychology of the defendant\nanswering the second time, whether that policeman was a\nfool or a knave seems beside the point. And so if your --\nif -- if your whole argument is one of psychology, I don't\nget it. Now, that's -- maybe there's more to your\nargument than just the psychology of the -- the criminal\nor the defendant -- the criminal defendant the second\ntime. And if so, I want you to respond to that.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, Your Honor, I think we're\nworried about suspects being coerced and compelled into\ngiving statements that aren't according to their free\nwill. We're --\nQUESTION: Which statements are you talking\nabout? The first or the second?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Both.\nQUESTION: Both, okay. How does the first work?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I'm not sure I understand the\nquestion, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If in fact you're worried about\npolicemen subtly coercing the first statement, why do you\nhave to stop admission of the second statement?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, the first statement is\nautomatically excluded pursuant to Miranda. The reason\nwhy we need to exclude the second statement as well is\nbecause by using the first statement, by referring back to\nthe first statement, also by pressuring the waiver to get\nthe second statement, it's not as clear as it would\nnormally be that the second statement is voluntary after\nthe suspect has been subjected to the lengthy\ninterrogation before.\nI mean, police officers wouldn't roll the dice\nif they knew it didn't work. This officer had used this\ntactic for 8 to 10 years because he knows it works.\nQUESTION: Work to do what? To coerce or to\npersuade or something else? That's -- that's what I'm\ntrying to get from you.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, it undermines the free\nwill. It's -- it -- the tactic is used to prevent the\nexercise of free will. Had she been given the warnings at\nthe outset, she may well have invoked or asked for an\nattorney when pressure was too intense on her. What we're\nleaving --\nQUESTION: Well, could you argue that once you\nknow what questioning is like for, say, an hour and then\nyou get the warning, you have a better idea of whether you\nwant to go through with this or not? Again, these are\nempirical things that I'm -- I'm not sure we're qualified\nto judge. Maybe -- maybe we must.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I think, Your Honor, once --\nonce she had been subjected to the lengthy interrogation\nand they got that statement from her that they had\npressured out of her, then when she -- they said, you\nknow, for -- for instance, they would have an incentive to\nsay, okay, now what you just told us we're going to put on\ntape and I will be back here with a tape recorder and we\nwill put it on tape. This is what a judge and a jury is\ngoing to hear.\nQUESTION: It's true if -- if we accept that --\nthat the first statement was pressured out of her. I\nmean, I assume -- I assume that what we're proceeding on\nhere is the belief that it was not coercion in the first\ninstance. I think everybody agrees if it was coerced in\nthe first instance, the case is over. Is that what you\nmean by pressured out of her, or -- or the mere -- the\nmere failure to give Miranda warning constitutes pressure?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I don't think the mere failure\nto administer the warning may create the pressure, but\nit's when the officer embarks upon the -- the specific\nquestioning and interrogation to get -- deliberately\nelicit an incriminating response, then you have this type\nof coercive environment or coercive manner of questioning\nthat Elstad was concerned with. And I think that's why\nElstad's opinion cited Pierce and Westover for the types\nof questioning that would necessarily or -- or run the\ngreat risk of coercing the defendant into confessing.\nQUESTION: Well, and -- and if it did coerce,\nthen -- then Elstad said its rule would not apply. Wasn't\nElstad only saying that when this exists, there may be\npossible a finding of actual coercion, but it's -- it's\nnot assuming that there is actual coercion whenever that\nexists or -- or making a total exception from the rule\nthat it laid down for situations in which there was what\nyou call -- what -- what do you call it? Orderly\ninterrogation or programmed interrogation?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I'm just looking at the language\nof Elstad and when it said it's an unwarranted extension\nof Miranda, it was saying just the simple failure to\nadminister the warnings unaccompanied by the actual\ncoercive tactics or the manner of questioning when that is\ncoercive or if -- if the environment that it's being done\nin is coercive, such as the, you know, station house, then\n-- then there would be no presumption, then the second\nstatement wouldn't be compelled. But when you have those\nfactors, when there's the great risk that it's being --\nthat the statement is being made under the threat of\ncoercion or pressure or where the environment is -- is\ncoercive, then you do have the presumption.\nQUESTION: Well, when it speaks of coercive\nenvironment or coercive tactics, I -- I assumed that what\nit meant is that the prior confession was coerced.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe\nthat under Miranda when the Court said that the custodial\n-- custodial interrogation exerts inherently coercive\npressure, I think that means when they question and\ndeliberately elicit an incriminating response that is\ncompelling, and --\nQUESTION: Well then, why have we allowed\nadmission of so many statements, you know, impeachment,\npublic -- public interest, that sort of thing, that result\nfrom a situation where there weren't Miranda warnings\ngiven if -- if simply station house interrogation always\nproduces coercion?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Because there, Your Honor, I\nthink that the Court was balancing the interest of law\nenforcement against the interest of allowing a suspect to\nget on the stand and later lie at trial. It affected the\ntruth-seeking function of the trial, which is greatly\nimpacted here because here --\nQUESTION: We -- we would not balance if there\nwere actual coercion. I mean, once you find actual\ncoercion, the game is over. You don't bend the law into\nbalance.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: In -- in terms of whether you're\ngoing to admit the second statement, in the presence of\nthe potential for coercion or actual coercion, then the\nburden needs to shift to the State. When they've employed\nthese tactics that generate the risk of compulsion, they\nneed to show that that risk never manifested itself.\nQUESTION: But you're -- you -- you -- in what\nyou just said, you say, you know, potential for -- for\ncoercion, coercion. Those are different things.\nCoercion, in -- in the sense we've used it in the Fifth\nAmendment cases, means that the confession is involuntary,\nand as Justice Scalia says, there's -- there's no\nbalancing there. But you're using it in a different\nsense, aren't you?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I'm saying that if in this\ncontext where it was actually coerced, then no, her\nstatement would not have been admissible to impeach her at\n-- at all if she had been -- testified at trial.\nQUESTION: But -- but no lower court has found\nthat the statement was actually coerced or that the\nconfession -- the statement was involuntary because of\ntactics of the government.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, I believe the Missouri\nSupreme Court found that only in circumstances other than\nthese would that first statement have been found\nvoluntary. That's the language of the opinion. They also\nfound the waiver involuntary in citing the Westover-type\nanalysis. The two cases that they relied on --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought what the court did\nwas make its decision on the basis that the Miranda\nwarning was intentionally not given and that that was the\nreason that the supreme court found that the statement\ncould not be admitted. It -- it didn't turn on actual\ncoercion, did it? What did the trial court find on that?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: The --\nQUESTION: No actual coercion.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: The trial court didn't make any\nspecific fact-findings about voluntariness. The -- all it\nwas concerned was -- with that Miranda wasn't given.\nQUESTION: Wasn't given, and the reason that the\nsupreme court felt that it had to be suppressed was\nbecause the decision not to give Miranda was an\nintentional decision by the officer.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I believe that was part of the\nanalysis, but the reason they found the waiver involuntary\nwas because of the continuous nature of the interrogation,\nand it cited the Westover-type cases for that.\nQUESTION: What about -- suppose our reason --\nQUESTION: We took the -- we took the case to\nanswer the question of whether or not Oregon v. Elstad is\n-- is abrogated when the initial failure to give the\nMiranda warnings was intentional. I mean, we -- that's --\nthat's what we're here to decide.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: And I think, Your Honor, when a\npolice officer deliberately embarks upon a tactic to\nundermine the free will of a suspect in a coercive setting\nthat Miranda acknowledges is a coercive setting, that that\ndoes make a difference because it -- it impels the police\nofficer into using tactics that otherwise wouldn't be\npermissible, such as referring to the unwarned statement\nto get a waiver --\nQUESTION: Well, I would have thought you'd look\nat what happened in the second discussion after Miranda\nwarnings were given to determine whether it was voluntary\n-- a voluntary statement or not. Was there a knowing and\nvoluntary waiver of those rights given at the second\nstatement? Isn't that the proper inquiry?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I believe it is, Your Honor.\n-- and that's why I -- I went back to the Missouri Supreme\nCourt's opinion where they found that the waiver was\ninvoluntary based on the totality of the circumstances in\nthe interrogation, that the --\nQUESTION: But -- but the question presented is\nbased on Oregon v. Elstad. It quotes it. Is the rule\nthat a suspect who has once responded to an unwarned yet\nuncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from\nwaiving his rights? I mean, that's -- that's what we're\nhere to decide.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, Your Honor, maybe the\npremise of the question presented was incorrect that there\nwas no --\nQUESTION: Did you -- in -- did you in your\nbrief in opposition make the point that you thought that\nit was -- it was coerced?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Yes, Your Honor, we did. We\ncited Westover.\nQUESTION: You're talking about the second one\nnow. Sorry. Is what you -- were you finished? Go ahead.\nFinish it.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, I don't want to --\nQUESTION: Finish the Chief Justice's --\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I don't want to leave any doubt\nthat I -- that the first statement we are asserting in the\nfirst instance was actually coerced. I mean, we disagree\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, as I -- may I interrupt you and\nask you to -- whether this distinction captures your case?\nI -- I have understood you to be saying that the -- the\nfirst statement was -- was coercive in the sense that\nMiranda spoke of a custodial interrogation as being\ninherently coercive. It was not, on the other hand,\ncoerced in the sense that it was the product of beating\nhim over the head with a 2 by 4. And as I understand it,\nyou have been saying, look, any unwarned Miranda -\nunwarned statement that is given in custody shares the --\nthe character that Miranda said it had, inherently\ncoercive atmosphere. But that doesn't mean the same thing\nas -- as coercion carried to the point of hitting him over\nthe head. Is that the distinction that -- that underlies\nyour argument, or am I putting words in your mouth?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I don't believe that what the\npolice officers did here would have rise -- rose to the\nlevel of Fourth Amendment due process involuntariness, no.\nBut I do believe it violated the Fifth Amendment bar on\ncoerced, compelled testimony.\nQUESTION: To go to the question that I think\nwas presented, let's make my assumptions and let me\noverstate a little bit.\nMy first assumption is it's intolerable to have\npolicemen going around purposely -- purposely -- violating\nthe Miranda rule. Now, assume that conclusion, though I\nknow it's arguable.\nNow, if that happens, if they deliberately and\npurposely have not given these warnings when they knew\nthey should, that would create a situation where they\nmight do it a lot and we'd have a lot of coerced\nconfessions we couldn't ever prove. Okay? So I consider\nthat -- let's call it bad.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: All right. Now, if -- if we make\nthat assumption, then the question is, well, can the\npolice, nonetheless, introduce a second statement that was\ndone after warnings? Now, there are three possible\npositions: always, never, and sometimes.\nSo I'm exploring the sometimes. Now, I want to\nknow if -- what kind of a rule might you think was okay on\nthe sometimes.\nNow, one thing I thought of is if they can show\n-- not you, but the prosecutor can show that that first\nstatement taken was not coerced and that, second, they\nreally gave the warnings the second time, and that, third,\nsomething happened to cut that causal connection because\nthe average person would think, of course, I've got to say\nwhat I said before, otherwise they're going to do\nsomething really terrible to me. All right? So -- so\nwhat -- now, I'm looking for passage of time, I'm looking\nfor something else to cut the causal connection.\nBut I'm looking really for your view on this.\nIf the answer is sometimes, if the answer is never, but if\nit is sometimes, what kind of a sometimes?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I believe that sometimes the\nsecond statement may be admitted, and that's what Elstad\nsaid. Even in the presence of actual coercion, they said\nthat it could be dispelled. And --\nQUESTION: Okay. Sometimes you say it could.\nNow, what kinds of things would dispel it and what isn't\ndispelled about your case?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I think if there was a passage\nof time, it would dispel it, and that certainly didn't\noccur here. Even in Westover, there was a 15- to 20-\nminute break by the time the police stopped questioning\nand the FBI started questioning, and that came out at oral\nargument. Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall said there\nwas a break. So there was no break here.\nQUESTION: Is that enough? If -- if there's an\ninterval, same place, same officers, but it -- is\neverything -- everything turn on how much time there is in\nbetween the two?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I'm not sure it could entirely\nturn on that, but for instance, if questioning had\noccurred the next day, I believe that would be a -- a\nsufficient break. And I think the Missouri Supreme Court\ncited another of our State cases, State v. Wright, where\nthis exact thing happened, questioning occurred and then a\nday passed, and then questioning occurred again, and that\nwas sufficient to break the causal link.\nI think if officers embarking on this type of\ncalculated, unwarned questioning then add to their\nwarnings, when they finally give them, that what you said\ncan't be used against you, if they would have added that,\nthat might have helped an attenuation analysis. But I\nthink clearly none of that occurred here.\nI think the -- another problem with this case\nand this type of tactic is that it affects the truth-\nseeking function of the trial, the jury, and what it's\nfinding because the first thing the jury hears is when the\ntape is played and they hear immediately a waiver of\nrights and --\nQUESTION: Let -- let me interrupt you for just\na minute, Ms. -- is -- is it agreed that the break here\nwas 20 minutes? That's what the Supreme Court of Missouri\nmajority opinion says.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I believe it was 15 to 20\nminutes. 20 minutes, if according to the court, yes.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Going back to the truth-seeking\nfunction of the jury, when the jury is listening to the\nstatement, they are presuming that she immediately waived\nher rights. They know nothing of what occurred before,\nand the only way that we can challenge that and show that\nmaybe this confession shouldn't be given the weight that\nit -- it otherwise would have is that she underwent this\nlengthy interrogation. And the only way we can bring that\nfor the -- before the jury is to show them that she, in\nfact, made an unwarned statement. And that -- it\nprecludes our ability to defend her by not being able to\nshow under what circumstances she ultimately made that\nwaiver.\nIt also allows the -- the unwarned statement to\ncome in because on that tape recording you have the\nofficer mentioning that she made an unwarned statement,\nand the jury is never supposed to hear that. So here you\nhave the jury thinking, well, she made two statements. It\nmust be the truth.\nQUESTION: Well, it's not a complete answer to\nyour argument. Of course, you can have an initial\nsuppression motion before the court. I -- I see the --\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Right. I mean, and when that's\ndenied we are still able to show the circumstances under\nwhich the confession was made are relevant to the weight\nto be given to it. I mean, the jury can always weigh the\ncredibility of the suspect and -- in assessing the weight\nto be given to her confession. And we cannot challenge\nthat here without referring to the unwarned questioning.\nIf there's no --\nQUESTION: Of course, your argument would still\nbe the same if this was all coercive, and to the extent\nthe statements are repetitive, it's just cumulative. I --\nI do see your point.\nLet me -- let me ask you this. In response to\nJustice Stevens' question -- and then we got off on some\nother matters -- opposing counsel -- Justice Stevens\nsaid, well, why won't police do this all the time and why\nwould they have the incentive to make this standard\nprocedure? And the answer I thought was that if you're\ngoing to waive your rights, you're going to waive your\nrights, so it doesn't make any difference. But that seems\nto me to actually help your side.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and I\nguarantee you that if this Court says that this practice\nis okay, it will become embedded in police procedure just\nlike Miranda has been because the police --\nQUESTION: If -- if the answer is if they're\ngoing to waive, they're going to waive, then there's no\nreason why not they don't give the warning at the outset.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Exactly. I mean, they have more\nincentive not to warn, especially because they talked to\nher before on two occasions. They -- and I think they\ntape recorded her interview with them on the -- February\n14th, hoping that she would make some sort of\nincriminating statement, and when she didn't, then they\nengaged in this practice to subject her to the intense\ncustodial interrogation to try and get the -- the warning\nfrom her. But they weren't -- I mean -- excuse me -- the\nconfession from her. But they weren't going to warn her\nbecause they were afraid she might invoke. And I think\nthis Court in Escobedo said, you know, we shouldn't fear\nthat a suspect is going to assert her rights if she knew\nabout them.\nQUESTION: Escobedo was pretty much overruled by\nMiranda, wasn't it?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Yes, Your Honor, but I think the\n-- that specific principle would remain and that this\nCourt would agree with that we should not have to fear\nthat a suspect will invoke their rights. I mean, that was\nthe whole premise of Miranda is that they have to be made\naware of their rights so that they have the free will to\ninvoke them if -- if they are not willing to be subjected\nto the intense pressure of the custodial interrogation.\nQUESTION: Ms. Bartholow, you -- you've asserted\nthat the question presented is not -- is not really\naccurate, that -- that the Missouri court, in fact, had\nfound that given the totality of the circumstances, one of\nwhich was the intentional failure to give Miranda\nwarnings, the second statement was -- was coerced. And I\nfind that in fact that your brief in opposition did make\nthat point.\nNow, if -- if the question presented as set\nforth in the petitioner's brief is not accurate, what do\nyou think would be accurate? Would -- do you think it\npresents the question at least of whether the intentional\nfailure to give a Miranda warning is one of the factors\nproperly considered in determining whether the second\nconfession is voluntary or not? It at least presents that\nquestion, doesn't it?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I think it presents that\nquestion. I don't -- I don't think the Court should\nproceed on the assumption that the initial statement was\nvoluntary, and that is -- that's always been our first\nline of defense, is that this wasn't a voluntary statement\nbecause under Elstad -- under Elstad the Court said that\nwhen a suspect is being subjected to a coercive\nenvironment or where the manner of the questioning in the\ncase is coercive, then the standard Elstad rule doesn't\napply.\nAnd -- and especially because when Justice\nBrennan tried to posit this two-step interrogation that it\nwould become all the rage and specifically -- I mean, the\ndescription of Justice Brennan's two-step interrogation\nmirrors this -- this exactly. This Court said that's\napocalyptic. We are not encouraging that. We do not want\npolice officers or prosecutors to -- to use that tactic.\nAnd -- and unfortunately, I believe law enforcement took\nthe invitation of Justice Brennan's dissent perhaps and\ndidn't listen to what you said in the majority opinion.\nI think this tactic is bad for the police. It\nis bad for suspects, and it is bad for courts. It's got\nthree strikes against it. And the test that we would ask\nyou to apply is that when police officers deliberately\nwithhold Miranda in order to elicit an incriminating\nresponse when they knew or should have known that Miranda\nwas required, then the second statement will be presumed\ncompelled unless and until the State can show that it has\nbeen attenuated from the first.\nAnd if there --\nQUESTION: Why does the intentionality or not of\nthe failure to give the Miranda warning have anything to\ndo with whether the second confession is voluntary or not?\nI mean, I can understand why it's -- it's a nasty thing\nand you don't want the -- you don't want the State to do\nan end run around Miranda, as you understand Miranda, but\nwhy does it have anything whatever to do with the coercive\n-- with the coerced or non-coerced nature of the second\nconfession? The -- the woman would feel just as coerced\nwhether the failure to give it was -- was intentional or\nnon-intentional it seems to me.\nMS. BARTHOLOW: I -- I think the subjective\nintent of the officers will inform what the officers feel\nthey are allowed to do during the questioning session.\nThe -- the FBI itself required warnings long before\nMiranda and it was because it made the -- the\ninterrogators respect the person's rights, and that's why\nthe warnings were required. If the officer intends to\ndisrespect those rights and leave the Fifth Amendment\nunprotected, then I think there's a grave danger that they\nwill use tactics that they used here, that they will refer\nto the unwarned statement to pressure the waiver, that\nthey will refer to the unwarned statement to get the\nsecond statement, and that there will never be an exercise\nof the suspect's free will.\nQUESTION: Well, but Justice Scalia's question,\nif you have the officer in good faith makes a mistake,\nwhat difference does it make to the defendant?\nMS. BARTHOLOW: Well, I think in the absence --\nwell, when there's a good faith mistake, I don't think\nyou're going to run into the types of coercive pressures\nthat were applied, and that's what Elstad was. You had\none or two questions at the suspect's house. You know,\nwe're here to talk about a burglary. Do you know these\npeople? Yes. Well, we think you were involved in that.\nYes, I was there. Period. You know.\nThere was a question whether there was custody\nor not. I don't think this Court would have found custody\nin the first instance. And there was a real question\nabout whether that constituted an interrogation at all.\nAnd I think in those circumstances -- or -- or if an\nofficer just didn't know that they hadn't been Mirandized\nby the first officer or something, when there's clearly a\ngood faith error on the part of the police, then this test\nwould not be required.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bartholow.\nMs. Mitchell, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KAREN K. MITCHELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MITCHELL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nOn the issue of systematic interrogation that\ncame up several times during the argument, that is\nrelevant only if it rises to the level of making that\nfirst statement actually involuntary. And I think that's\nclear from the Elstad opinion itself. At one point during\nthe Elstad opinion, specifically in footnote 2 of the\nmajority opinion, the Court is talking about lower court\ndecisions where the -- the lower court did not apply the\nattenuation-type doctrine. And referring to some of those\ncases as involving, quote, clearly voluntary, unwarned\nadmissions, the Court then goes on and cites a number of\ncases that involve actual station house interrogations, in\nmany cases much longer than the interrogation we have\nhere. Specifically, I'd point the Court to the Derrico\ndecision cited in Elstad.\nSo just the idea that you have a traditional\nstation house-type interrogation is not enough. The\nquestion is, does it render the first statement\ninvoluntary and therefore capable of tainting the second\nstatement?\nIn this case the question of voluntariness of\neach statement was raised in the initial motion to\nsuppress, and even though there were not extensive\nfindings by the trial court, they denied those motions to\nsuppress. And that issue was not raised again in either\nof the appellate courts in Missouri, and the Missouri\nSupreme Court did not reach that issue.\nOn the question of what the Missouri Supreme\nCourt held, three points I think are very important. The\ncourt starts out by phrasing or -- or characterizing its\ndecision as such. Essential to the inquiry is whether the\npresumption that the first statement was involuntary\ncarries over to the second statement. The court then goes\non and throughout the opinion makes the decision to, in\nfact, carry that presumption forward. It focuses on\nintent and finds intent to be an improper tactic, as this\nCourt used that phrase in Elstad, which is the predicate\nthen for applying a fruits-type analysis and requiring\nattenuation, which is exactly what the Missouri Supreme\nCourt does. And that is why we sought cert in this case.\nAs to this -- the -- the apocalyptic issue and\nJustice Brennan's discussion in Elstad, Justice Brennan\ntalked about a number of situations, including the\napplication of Miranda to the Fourth Amendment, including\nthe use of statements by police officers to garner a\nwaiver which did not happen here, and other things that\nare simply inapplicable. This case is not that situation.\nFinally, what we are asking this Court to do is\nto reverse the Missouri court decision that focused on\nintent, deterrence, and the carrying forward of the\npresumption to taint the subsequent statement because each\nof those findings are inconsistent with this Court's\nholding in Elstad, and instead to apply the framework of\nElstad to this case and to reverse.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nMitchell.\n"
