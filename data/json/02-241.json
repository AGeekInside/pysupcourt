        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-241, Barbara Grutter v. Lee Bollinger.\nMr. Kolbo.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nTHE WITNESS: Mr. Chief Justice and May it\nplease the Court:\nBarbara Grutter applied for admission to the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School with a personal right\nguaranteed by the Constitution that she would not have her\nrace counted against her. That race -- that the\napplication would be considered for free from the taint of\nracial discrimination. The law school intentionally\ndisregarded that right by discriminating against her on\nthe basis of race as it does each year in the case of\nthousands of individuals who apply for admission.\nThe law school defends its practice of race\ndiscrimination as necessary to achieve a diverse student\nbody. With the loss -- with the diversity that the law\nschool is committed to ensuring and meaningful numbers or\ncritical mass, is of a narrow kind defined exclusively by\nrace and ethnicity.\nThe constitutional promise of equality would not\nbe necessary in a society composed of a single homogenous\nmass.\nIt is precisely because we are a nation teeming\nwith different races and ethnicities -- one that is\nincreasingly interracial, multiracial, that it is so\ncrucial for our Government to honor its solemn obligation\nto treat all members of our society equally without\npreferring some individuals over others.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, you -- I mean, a\nuniversity or a law school is faced with a serious problem\nwhen it's one that gets thousands of applications for just\na few slots. Where it has to be selective. And inherent\nin that setting is making choices about what students to\nadmit.\nSo you have an element here that suggests that\nthere are many reasons why a particular student would be\nadmitted or not. And a lot of factors go into it.\nSo how do you single this out and how are we\ncertain that there's an injury to your client that she\nwouldn't have experienced for other reasons?\nMR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor, first of all, race\nis impermissible because of the constitutional command of\nequality. The university is certainly free to make many\ndifferent kinds of choices in selecting students.\nAnd to look for all kinds of different\ndiversity, experiential diversity, prospective diversity\nwithout regard to race, but race because, Your Honor, of\nthe constitutional command of equality, must be beyond the\nbounds --\nQUESTION: You say that's not -- it can't be a\nfactor at all. Is that it? Is that your position that it\ncannot be one of many factors?\nMR. KOLBO: Our view, Your Honor, is that race\nitself should not be a factor among others in choosing\nstudents because of the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Well, you have some -- some\nprecedents out there that you have to come to grips with,\nbecause the Court obviously has upheld the use of race in\nmaking selections or choices in certain contexts, for\ninstance, to remedy prior to discrimination in other\ncontexts.\nMR. KOLBO: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. KOLBO: And I want to be clear about that.\nWe are --\nQUESTION: Well, but you are speaking in\nabsolutes and it isn't quite that. I think we have given\nrecognition to the use of race in a variety of settings.\nMR. KOLBO: And we absolutely agree, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: Is it cause for concern with your --\nif you're the dean of the law school or the president in\nthe university or the Governor of the State that minority\nstudents, particularly from the Black and Hispanic\ncommunity are underrepresented by a large factor,\naccording to their -- their share of the population.\nSuppose you have a law school with two or three\npercent Hispanic and -- and black students, is that a\nlegitimate concern for the university and for the State\nofficials?\nMR. KOLBO: We believe not, Your Honor, for the\nreason that we need to get away from the notion that\nthere's some right number for each racial group.\nQUESTION: So if year after year after year\nthere's an underrepresentation, there is no cause for the\nState or the Government or its educational experts to be\nconcerned whatsoever?\nMR. KOLBO: I wouldn't say not to be concerned,\nYour Honor, I think the mere fact of underrepresentation,\nthat is that say, blacks are not represented as they are\nin the population is not a concern that would justify\nracial preferences. It certainly would justify perhaps\nbroad social and political concerns.\nQUESTION: Well, it's a broad social and\npolitical concern that there are not adequate members of\n-- of a profession which is designed to protect our rights\nand to -- and to promote progress. I would -- I should\nthink that's a very legitimate concern on the part of the\nState.\nMR. KOLBO: The current concern there, Your\nHonor, ought to be addressed by -- by addressing the\nproblem. If there is some reason that -- that particular\nminority groups are not participating as fully in the\nfruits of our society such as being represented at the\nschools, we need to address those problems.\nBut racial preferences don't address those\nproblems.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kolbo, may I call your attention\nin that regard to the brief that was filed on behalf of\nsome retired military officers who said that to have an\nofficer corps that includes minority members in any\nnumber, there is no way to do it other than to give not an\noverriding preference, but a plus for race. It cannot be\ndone through a percentage plan, because of the importance\nof having people who are highly qualified. What is your\nanswer to the argument made in that brief that there\nsimply is no other way to have Armed Forces in which\nminorities will be represented not only largely among the\nenlisted members, but also among the officer cadre?\nMR. KOLBO: Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe we\nhave an adequate record in this case from which to\nconclude that we wouldn't have representation of\nminorities. The military in the absence of --\nQUESTION: Suppose that were true. Let's take\nthat as the fact, would you still say nonetheless even if\nit's true that there will be very few, if any, minority\nmembers admitted to the military academies, still you\ncannot use race?\nMR. KOLBO: I believe race could not be used,\nYour Honor. I think that other solutions could be looked\nat addressing the problem why they are not minorities in\nthe military. I note that the United States has not taken\na position. We have the brief as Your Honor has mentioned\nfrom several individuals, the United States has not taken\na position in this case, the military academies have not\ntaken a position.\nQUESTION: Yes, they have, if the brief is\naccurate about the regulations, the academies have taken a\nposition?\nMR. KOLBO: As I understand it, Justice Stevens,\nthe briefs are filed on the behalf of individuals.\nQUESTION: I understand that. But they are\nquoting material that the academies have distributed,\nwhich indicate they do give preferences.\nMR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Do you challenge the fact -- that\nthat is a matter of fact?\nMR. KOLBO: We don't challenge what they say,\nYour Honor. We're just suggesting -- we don't have a\nrecord in this case.\nQUESTION: No, but do you challenge the fact\nthat they are giving the preference?\nMR. KOLBO: We don't have enough information on\nit to know whether --\nQUESTION: Are you serious that you think there\nis a serious question about that? That we cannot take\nthat green brief as a representation of fact?\nMR. KOLBO: I just don't know, Your Honor, what\nthe facts are with respect to the military because this\ncase was --\nQUESTION: It depends on what factor you're\ntalking about, doesn't it? You accept the fact that\nthey're giving preferences, but that doesn't convert to\nthe fact that if they didn't give preferences, there is no\nother way to get an officer corps that includes some\nminority people, does the brief say that?\nMR. KOLBO: It does not, Your Honor. We have no\nevidence as to what the extent of representation is.\nQUESTION: The issue as I understand it is not\nwhether without preferences there can be a military\nacademy population with some minorities, the question is\nwhether without the -- the weighting of race that they do\nin fact give, they can have an adequate number of\nminorities in the academies to furnish ultimately a\nreasonable number of minorities in the officer corps,\nthat's the issue, isn't it?\nMR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the\nterms you've used, reasonable and adequate, we have no\ninformation in this record on which I can make those --\nQUESTION: More than what would happen if they\ndid nothing?\nMR. KOLBO: And that number, Your Honor, I don't\nknow what it is. Again, because it wasn't part of this\ncase. I think it's more --\nQUESTION:\ndid something else, such as making special provision for\nall people of economically disadvantaged background. We\ndon't know whether that would have produced the same\nnumber, either.\nMR. KOLBO: That's correct, Your Honor. As the\nCourt --\nQUESTION: Do you believe that that would be an\nadequate -- at least means of experimenting here -- take\nit as an alternative?\nMR. KOLBO: Taking race neutral alternatives\ninto consideration?\nQUESTION: Well, taking for example economic\ndisadvantage?\nMR. KOLBO: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Do you seriously believe that that\nwould be anything but a surrogate to race? It would take\nthe word race out of the categorization of the label that\nwe put on it, but do you believe it would function in a\ndifferent way but as a surreptitious approach to race?\nMR. KOLBO: It certainly functions differently,\nYour Honor. Race controls --\nQUESTION: Do you think it would?\nMR. KOLBO: Certainly, yes --\nQUESTION: Is there any reason to believe that\nit would?\nMR. KOLBO: I do, Your Honor, because it's not\njust minorities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged\nin this country. That happens with respect across racial\nlines. So race neutral alternatives --\nQUESTION: The object -- but the object I would\nhave assumed given the dialogue, the object is to increase\nthe racial number of the percentage of minorities. If\nthat is the object, than whatever it is, it's not a race\nneutral measure.\nMR. KOLBO: Well, I would disagree, Your Honor,\nbecause I think if you have a race neutral means that\naccomplishes many purposes, and one of them is race, that\nis not necessarily under this Court's precedents\nunconstitutional. The Court --\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you this, it's about\nthe military brief that you didn't come here to argue\nabout, but it will maybe get you back to your case.\nMR. KOLBO: Sure.\nQUESTION: The military brief tells us -- the\ngreen brief -- that there are preparatory schools that the\nacademies have and 40 percent of the registration in those\npreparatory schools are racial minorities.\nAnd they -- suppose the Government does this and\nexpends money for the purpose of recruiting and helping\nracial minorities apply to the academies and succeed\nthere.\nIs that a proper constitutional purpose?\nMR. KOLBO: I see no constitutional objection\nthere, Justice Kennedy. For the reason I think it -- it's\nquite permissible in principle to draw a line between\ncasting a wider net, recruiting and -- and the point of\ncompetition where people -- where people -- where the\ndecision must be made whether people are going to be\ntreated on the basis of the same --\nQUESTION: Would you allow recruiting targeted\nat minorities?\nMR. KOLBO: I don't see the constitutional\nobjection with that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Fine. If you can use race as a\ncriterion for spending money, I take it one argument on\nthe other side, which I'd like you to address, is that we\nlive in a world where more than than half of all the\nminority -- really 75 percent of black students below the\ncollege level are at schools that are more than 50 percent\nminority. And 85 percent of those schools are in areas of\npoverty.\nAnd many among other things that they tell us on\nthe other side is that many people feel in the schools,\nthe universities, that the way -- the only way to break\nthis cycle is to have a leadership that is diverse. And\nto have a leadership across the country that is diverse,\nyou have to train a diverse student body for law, for the\nmilitary, for business, for all the other positions in\nthis country that will allow us to have a diverse\nleadership in a country that is diverse.\nNow, you're familiar with that argument. But if\nit is reasonable to use race as a criterion, as a plus for\nspending money, why isn't it also reasonable to use it as\na plus to see that -- to obtain that set of objectives\nthat I've tried to summarize in a second that you're very\nfamiliar with.\nMR. KOLBO: Because very simply, Justice Breyer,\nthe Constitution provides the right of -- individuals with\nthe right of equal protection. And by discriminating on\nthe basis of race at a point of competition, innocent\nindividuals are being injured in their constitutional\nrights. That's the distinction between that and simply\ntrying to cast a wider net, recruiting spending money on\noutreach efforts, a very principal line it seems to me can\nbe drawn between those two things.\nQUESTION: The reason that the injury is more\nsevere to the white person who doesn't get in when that\nwhite person doesn't get in because she's not an athlete\nor he's not a -- he's not a alumnus or he's not any of the\nother things that fits within these other criteria? What\nis the difference there is?\nMR. KOLBO: The difference is the Equal\nProtection Clause, Your Honor. It does not apply to\nalumni preferences in scholarships. It applies to race.\nQUESTION: That's the legal conclusion. But the\nreason if I thought, for example, that there is a\ndifference under the Equal Protection Clause, between a\nsystem that says to the discriminated-against people, the\nlaw does not respect you, and a system that says the law\ndoes respect you, but we are trying to help some others,\nsuppose I thought that that is a sound legal distinction\nas reflected in this Court's cases, you would reply that?\nMR. KOLBO: Sound and reasonable, Your Honor, is\nnot enough when it comes to race. It must be a compelling\npurpose. And that is the difference. There are many\npolicy choices a university can make that I may disagree\nor agree with, and that I have no legal standing or no\nclient has a legal standing to challenge, because they\ndon't implicate important constitutional rights. There is\nsomething special about race in this country. It's why we\nhave a Constitution about it. It's why we have a\nconstitutional amendment about it.\nQUESTION: Why -- why do you draw the line at --\nyou said you can recruit -- you can use a race criterion,\nif I understood you correctly, to recruit, you could have\nminority students only given the benefit of scholarships\nto go to these preparatory schools. You were surely\nrecognizing the race criterion there. Why is that\npermissible?\nMR. KOLBO: Because it doesn't prevent someone\nfrom applying. The key is to be able to compete on the\nsame footing at the point of competition.\nQUESTION: These preparatory schools -- do you\nconcede that they're only for minority students? I'm\nfamiliar with those preparatory schools, familiar or not?\nMR. KOLBO: Certainly not --\nQUESTION: The majority of the people that\nattend them are young men and women who really want to get\ninto the service academies, but don't have the grades for\nit. And the service academy tells them whether they're\nblack, white or anything else, go to these preparatory\nschools and you'll have a better chance next time around.\nMR. KOLBO: That --\nQUESTION: It isn't just for minorities.\nMR. KOLBO: They're not, Your Honor. They are\nopen to -- accessible to all.\nQUESTION: I was asking you about your answer to\nthe question, not -- the fact may very well be, but I\nthought you had answered the question, yes, you could have\nspecial preparation for minorities only, yes, you could\nhave recruitment for minorities only. I thought that that\nwas your answer.\nMR. KOLBO: I believe you can -- as part of a\nbroad program, I believe you could. You could seek\noutreach for minority students, because it's very simple\nit seems to me to draw a principal distinction between\noutreach, casting a wider net and applying the same\nstandard at the point of -- at the point of competition.\nQUESTION: Including at the point of giving the\nbenefit of going to one of these preparatory schools. You\nwouldn't allow one of these preparatory schools to be for\nminority only, would you?\nMR. KOLBO: No, of course not, Your Honor. And\nI'm not suggesting that outreach would be limited to\nminorities only. I'm just suggesting that -- I don't\nunderstand why there would be a constitutional objection\nto trying to cast a wider net by focusing as part of a\nbroader effort of outreach in recruiting minority students\nand it can be quite -- it's quite easy to draw the line\nbetween that and -- and the point of competition.\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nQUESTION: If you're right -- if you're right\nabout what equal protection requires and we have also two\nstatutes that incorporate the equal protection principle,\nthen there could be no affirmative action, I take it, in\nemployment?\nMR. KOLBO: There could be, Your Honor, to\nremedy past identified discrimination, but not to exceed\ndiversity and there is not today as I understand it any\ncompelling interest in the employment context with respect\nto --\nQUESTION: So, for example, if we have a prison\nthat was largely minority population and the state wanted\nto give a preference so that it would have a critical mass\nof correction officers of the minority race, that would be\nimpermissible?\nMR. KOLBO: It would be impermissible, Your\nHonor, unless based upon a compelling interest and the\nonly one that has been recognized in the employment\ncontext is identified discrimination. And I don't see\nthat in your hypothetical.\nQUESTION: No, it's not in my hypothetical.\nMR. KOLBO: Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you one question about the\nextent of your position? There's a brief applied, I think\nit's by the Potawatomi tribe. If Michigan had made -- the\ngovernor of Michigan many years ago had made a commitment\nto an Indian tribe to allow three persons into the\nUniversity of Michigan every year, three tribemen, and\nnothing else, would that be constitutionally permissible?\nMR. KOLBO: I don't believe so Your Honor.\nAgain, it's a distinction drawn on the basis of race.\nQUESTION: Or just one, still would be a -- that\nwould exclude an impermissible number of slots for --\nMR. KOLBO: If it's slots on the basis of race,\nYour Honor. And if there are no further questions, if I\nmay reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kolbo.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Michigan law school admissions program fails\nevery test this Court has articulated for evaluating\ngovernmental racial preferences.\nFirst, it is --\nQUESTION: General Olson, just let me get a\nquestion out and you answer it at your convenience. I'd\nlike you to comment on Carter Phyllip's brief. What is\nyour view of the strength of that argument?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I'm not sure --\nQUESTION: That's the one about the generals and\nabout the military academies.\nGENERAL OLSON: I understand -- the -- our\nposition with respect to that is we respect the opinions\nof those individuals, but the position of the United\nStates is that we do not accept the proposition that black\nsoldiers will only fight for -- black officers or the\nreverse that race neutral means should be used in the\nacademies as well as other places.\nAnd that to the extent that there's any\ndifference in analysis, the Court might consider its\nposition, the position it articulated in connection with\nthe military in Rostker v. Goldberg. But our position\nwith respect to that brief is that --\nQUESTION: Your suggestion is that the military\nhas broader latitude than the private university?\nGENERAL OLSON: No, I'm suggesting that --\nQUESTION: Well, you're pointing to Rostker\nsuggests that.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, I'm suggesting that the\nCourt will want to look at each of these individual\nsituations according to the circumstances and that may be\na factor in that context. But I started my answer,\nJustice Stevens, by saying you do not accept the\nproposition that race neutral means should not be used and\nemployed fully to -- to make sure that the academies are\naccessible and open and -- and offer opportunities for as\nmany people as possible.\nQUESTION: But you recognize, General Olson,\nthat here and now, all of the military academies do have\nrace preference programs in admissions?\nGENERAL OLSON: The Coast Guard does not. It's\nprohibited by Congress from doing so. I do acknowledge,\nJustice Ginsburg that the other academies are doing so.\nIt's the position of the United States --\nQUESTION: Is that that's illegal what they're\ndoing?\nGENERAL OLSON: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: Is it -- that it is illegal, a\nviolation of the Constitution?\nGENERAL OLSON: We haven't examined that and we\nhaven't presented a brief with respect to the specifics of\neach individual academy. And we would want to take into\nconsideration any potential impact suggested by the Court\nin the Rostker case.\nQUESTION: What do you -- what do you think is\nthe -- is the principal race neutral means, that the\nacademy should use?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Without criticizing necessarily what\nthey're doing now, what would be the -- in your judgment,\nthe best race neutral way for them to go about reaching\nyour objective?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, there are a variety of\nrace neutral means and narrowly tailored methods by which\nacademies and universities can reach out to people of all\nbackgrounds to make sure that they've eliminated --\nQUESTION: No, no. I realize your position.\nBut specifically, which -- which of the race neutral\nsuggestions that have been considered do you think would\nbe, you know, most adaptable to the academy situation?\nMR. KOLBO: Widespread recruiting, making sure\nthat there's opportunities for education and advancement\nin the -- in the academies.\nQUESTION: Recruiting with an objective of\nminority students?\nGENERAL OLSON: Not limited, a race neutral\nsystem of broad scale recruiting that this Court has\nalways supported the proposition that efforts may be made\nby governmental institutions to eliminate barriers that\nhave existed where artificial barriers --\nQUESTION: Okay. But my question is, if they\ndon't do it with a racial objective, how does the\nrecruiting respond to the position taken in -- in Mr.\nPhillips's brief that without the kind of -- of racial\nweighting and admissions that is given now, they simply\nwill not reach a -- a -- a substantial number of -- or be\nable to attain a substantial number of minority slots in\nthe class?\nGENERAL OLSON: That is the opinion of certain\nindividuals. It is -- we do not accept that conclusion\nbased upon those opinions. And this Court has repeatedly\nheld that race neutral means must be demonstrated and will\nbe accepted, and will not -- and the Court will not accept\nthe proposition that race neutral means will not be\nsuccessful unless they've been attempted and demonstrated.\nThese -- this program at the University of Michigan Law\nSchool fails every one of the Court's tests. First, it's\na thinly disguised quota which sets aside a significant\nportion of each year's entering class for preferred ethnic\ngroups.\nSecondly, it overtly employs stigmatizing and\ndivisive racial stereotypes, what the law school calls\ndiversity-relevant characteristics. It identifies persons\nby diversity-relevant characteristics.\nQUESTION: Well, what they do is they use race.\nGENERAL OLSON: Exactly.\nQUESTION: I know. But they have a reason for\nit. The reason for it is they want to produce a diverse\nclass and the reason they want to do that, using it as a\nplus, they say, is to do the things I said before. They\nthink it breaks down stereotypes within the class. They\nthink it's educationally beneficial. They think it\nsupplies a legal profession that will be diverse and they\nthink a legal profession like business and the military\nthat is diverse is good for America from a civics point of\nview, et cetera, breaks the cycle. Those are the\narguments which you well know.\nSo what is your response?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, a response to those many\narguments is that they've -- they're using stereotypes to\nin an effort, they say to break down stereotypes, they're\nusing race as a -- a surrogate for experience. And if\nthey want to look at experience, they can look at\nexperience. If they want to improve the educational\nopportunities of minority groups, one of the biggest\nproblems --\nQUESTION: That's not what they say. They say\nthey're not using race as a surrogate for anything,\nbecause if you have a person who went to Exeter who's very\nrich and happens to be black and is a conservative\nRepublican, it's great for the class to know that, too.\nAnd that's why they want a certain number.\nGENERAL OLSON: But that person -- that person\nif he went to Exeter and he has a great GPA and so forth\ngets an extra opportunity either a portion of the class is\nset aside for that individual solely on the basis of race,\nirrespective of his experience. And the -- and the\napplication isn't examined for the type of experience or\nthe type of viewpoint that race-diversity characteristic\nis used as a substitute for any examination of the\nindividual on the individual.\nQUESTION: General Olson, do you -- do you agree\nwith the articulated proposal of Justice Powell in the\nBakke case of using race as a plus factor as he -- as he\nsaw the use of it. Do you disagree with that approach?\nGENERAL OLSON: We disagree with that approach\nin the sense that we -- we -- in the first place, contrary\nto what our opponents have said, we would not believe that\nthat single opinion, which was the only opinion, to\nexamine the issue of diversity under a compelling argument\n--\nQUESTION: I don't think it commanded a court.\nI'm just asking if you agreed with that approach.\nGENERAL OLSON: We're reluctant to say never,\nJustice O'Connor. But this test -- every test that\nJustice Powell applied in that opinion, the law school\nprogram here fails. It's a stereotype.\nQUESTION: But General Olson, is race different\nfrom sex in that regard? I thought we have -- we have\ndisapproved using sex as just a plus factor? That is one\nfactor among many, but, you know, when you get down to it,\nthis is -- this person is a male and therefore we'll put\nthat into the mix and that'll favor the person. We've\ndisapproved that with regard to sex discrimination,\nhaven't we?\nGENERAL OLSON: I don't disagree with that.\nQUESTION: Why would race discrimination be any\ndifferent?\nGENERAL OLSON: I'm suggesting that the programs\nhere, without getting to the point of whether are there\nany other circumstances whether they be remedial, which\nthis Court -- a factor of the Court has recognized before,\nor something else in an unusual situation, where it could\nbe appropriate. I don't know what that might be. But\nthis test --\nQUESTION: I think Santa Clara -- I think what\nJustice Scalia said bears modification, because in fact in\nSanta Clara, the highway dispatcher, there was a plus for\nsex, although there was no proven discrimination against\nthat particular woman and this Court approved that.\nGENERAL OLSON: I would also say that it's\nconceivable if you're constructing -- the National\nInstitutes of Health is constructing this study of\ndiseases that focus on particular races, the race may be a\nfactor but the fact is that the law school program here,\nnot only is a set aside and a quota, but it -- but it --\n--\nQUESTION: General Olson, I'm not sure you\nanswered Justice O'Connor's question.\nDo you agree with Justice Powell's suggestion\nthat race could be used as a plus in something like the\nHarvard program?\nGENERAL OLSON: No, the Harvard program A wasn't\nexamined according to to any compelling governmental\ninterest. It was examined only --\nQUESTION: So your answer is no, you would not\nagree with that?\nGENERAL OLSON: We would not based upon any what\nwe see in that opinion, which is --\nQUESTION: Would you disagree with his use of\nthe term diversity as being a permissible governmental\ngoal?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the only way to answer\nthat Justice Kennedy is that the word diversity means so\nmany things to so many different people. It means both a\nmeans to get experience and a diversity of experience. It\nalso means, I think what the law school has done, it's an\nend in and of itself. If it's an end in and of itself,\nobviously it's constitutionally objectable that this Court\n--\nQUESTION:\nIf it's designed solely in order to have a diverse mix in\nthe colleges they take 10 percent, but their motive stated\nand their purpose is to have diversity in the college?\nGENERAL OLSON: Justice Breyer, I don't believe\nthat that is the stated motive of the Texas plan or the\nCalifornia or the Florida plan. Those are intended to\nopen up those institutions to a broader selection, one of\nthe ways in which this Court has accepted the institution\nsuch as universities may operate is to make sure that\nbarriers are broken down, accessibility is made more\navailable and that is one very race neutral means of\naccomplishing that legitimate objective.\nQUESTION: General, what do you say to the\nargument that the only reason accomplishes it is because\nit depends on segregation at the lower level of the\nschools, otherwise it would not accomplish that?\nGENERAL OLSON: No, there is no evidence that it\ndepends upon segregation of the schools in Texas or in any\nother place.\nIt is a diverse selection of the high schools in\nthat state.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMs. Mahoney, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that\ndiversity may be a compelling interest but contends that\nthe University of Michigan Law School can achieve a\ndiverse student body through facially race neutral means.\nHis argument ignores the record in this case.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure -- in his brief does he\nacknowledge that can be a compelling interest?\nMS. MAHONEY: The brief says that it is one of\nthe paramount interests of government to have diversity in\nhigher education. And it has certainly been the\nconsistent position of the Department of Education for the\npast 25 years that Bakke is the governing standard, that\nschools are encouraged to use programs to achieve\ndiversity, because of the important interests it serves\nfor students of all color.\nQUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, supposing that after our\nBakke decision came down, whereas Cal. Davis set aside 16\nseats for disadvantaged minorities, and Cal. Davis said\nwe're going to try to get those 16 seats in some other\nway, we're going to try high school graduates, we're going\nto try socioeconomic and none of the -- none of those\nmethods get the 16 seats that they want.\nCan they then go back and say we've tried\neverything, now we're entitled to set aside 16 seats?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. I\nthink what the Court's judgment in Bakke said and\ncertainly what Justice Powell's opinion said is that it's\nsimply not necessary to do a set aside because a plan like\nthe Harvard plan, which takes race into account as one\nfactor can be used as an effective means to --\nQUESTION: But my hypothesis was, they wanted 16\nseats and that plan just won't give it to them?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, if -- if the program was\ndesigned to have a fixed 16 seats, no matter what the\nqualifications of the applicant pool, no matter what the\ndisparities between the minority and majority students\nwould be, then I think it's fair to say that that would be\na quota.\nIf that is the nature of the program. But here\nthe record indicates that the -- the law school's program\nis nothing of the kind.\nThat what has occurred over the years with this\nprogram is that there have been offers that have ranged\nfrom 160 to 232 over the course of eight years there have\nbeen enrollments that went from 44 to 73. It has been a\nvery flexible program.\nQUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, I -- I find it hard to\ntake seriously the State of Michigan's contention that\nracial diversity is a compelling State interest,\ncompelling enough to warrant ignoring the Constitution's\nprohibition of discrimination on the basis of race.\nThe reason I say that is that the problem is a\nproblem of Michigan's own creation, that is to say, it has\ndecided to create an elite law school, it is one of the\nbest law schools in the country. And there are few State\nlaw schools that -- that get to that level.\nNow, it's done this by taking only the best\nstudents with the best grades and the best SATs or LSATs\nknowing that the result of this will be to exclude to a\nlarge degree minorities.\nIt is -- it's not unconstitutional to do that,\nbecause it's -- that's not -- not the purpose of what\nMichigan did, but it is the predictable result.\nNonetheless, Michigan says we want an elite law school.\nNow, having created this situation by making\nthat decision, it then turns around and says, oh, we have\na compelling State interest in eliminating this racial\nimbalance that we ourselves have created.\nNow, if Michigan really cares enough about that\nracial imbalance, why doesn't it do as many other State\nlaw schools do, lower the standards, not have a flagship\nelite law school, it solves the problem.\nMS. MAHONEY:\nanything in this Court's cases that suggests that the law\nschool has to make an election between academic excellence\nand racial diversity. The interest here is having a --\nQUESTION: If it claims it's a compelling State\ninterest. If it's important enough to override the\nConstitution's prohibition of racial discrimination, it\nseems to me it's important enough to override Michigan's\ndesire to have a super-duper law school?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the question isn't\nwhether it's important to override the prohibition on\ndiscrimination. It's whether this is discrimination.\nMichigan -- what Michigan is doing benefits --\nQUESTION: No, no. No. The question is whether\nor not there is a compelling interest that allows race to\nbe used.\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And Justice Scalia's question is\ndesigned to put to you the fact that this isn't a\ncompelling interest, because it's a choice that the\nMichigan law school has made to be like this.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the issue is whether\nit is sufficiently compelling to allow Michigan to take\nrace into account in this limited fashion in order to\nprovide a much better education for students of all races.\nThe benefits are race neutral, Your Honor, and the burdens\nare really quite limited.\nWhat we're talking about here --\nQUESTION: But the question put to you is\nMichigan has designed its school in a particular way and\nit doesn't have to do that.\nMS. MAHONEY: But Your Honor there is a\ncompelling interest in having an institution that is both\nacademically excellent and richly diverse, because our\nleaders need to be trained in institutions that are\nexcellent, that are superior academically, but they also\nneed to be trained with exposure to the viewpoints, to the\nprospectives, to the experiences of individuals from\ndiverse backgrounds.\nQUESTION: But -- but that brings us to the\nquestion of the use of race, which is being used here.\nLet me ask you this: Suppose there's a\nreasonable disagreement as to whether or not the so-called\ncritical mass is, in fact, a disguised quota, you would\nsay it is not. Suppose there's a reasonable disagreement\non that point, if that's so, you lose, is that not\ncorrect.\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, because the\ndistrict court did not make any factual findings that\nwould support the conclusion that this is a disguised\nquota.\nQUESTION: Is it beyond this Court's capacity to\nsay that? It certainly at a minimum a mixed question of\nlaw and fact. You're arguing here that it isn't. I'm\ncertainly -- at least open the possibility that we can\ndisagree with you.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, the -- there has\nto be evidence in the record that would support the\nconclusion that it's a quota. And what this Court has\nsaid that means is a fixed number -- that is sufficiently\nrigid that no matter what the qualifications of the\napplicant pool, the law school is going to adhere to a\nfixed minimum and I think it's important to say what the\njudge found on this issue, at 230A of the position of\nappendix, the judge says in conclusion, the Court finds\nthat the law school wants, 10 to 17 percent of each class\nto consist of African Americans, Native Americans and\nHispanics. Wants. That's an aspiration.\nQUESTION: It says wants or wants Maureen?\nMS. MAHONEY: Wants. Wants.\nQUESTION: Wants. Okay.\nMS. MAHONEY: Wants, Your Honor. That's an\naspiration, that is not a fixed minimum. He made no\nfindings that there was a fixed minimum.\nQUESTION: Is there in fact a difference between\nthe Michigan plan and the Harvard plan that the Harvard\nplan is tauted in Bakke, it seems to me, that they were\npretty close and is there any suggestion that Michigan is\nlooking for critical mass that Harvard didn't look for?\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely not, Your Honor. The\nevidence indicates that the Harvard plan works in exactly\nthe way the Michigan plan does. In fact, Harvard's brief\nin this case indicates that under their plan over the last\nfour years, they enrolled eight to 9 percent African\nAmericans which is a stable range. In the last four years\nof the record evidence here, the University of Michigan\nLaw School enrolled 7 to 9 percent African Americans.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Did Bakke hold that the\nHarvard plan was constitutional?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If adopted by -- by a State\ninstitution?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It held that it was constitutional?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes. What we --\nQUESTION: We didn't even -- we didn't even have\nthe details of the Harvard plan before us?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in fact, the Court\nappended -- or Justice Powell appended the Harvard plan to\nhis opinion in this case and there were five votes that\nthe reason that the mandate of the California Supreme\nCourt should be reversed was because there was an\neffective alternative for -- for enrolling minorities and\nthat effective alternative was a plan like the Harvard\nplan.\nAnd the -- the dissenting --\nQUESTION: Did -- did the Court know what --\nwhat social scientists have later pointed out and many\npeople knew before it that when the Harvard plan was\noriginally adopted, its purpose was to achieve diversity\nby reducing the number of Jewish students from New York\nthat were -- that were -- that were getting into Harvard\non the basis of merit alone?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think that was\n--\nQUESTION: Did that come up in the course of the\ncase?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think that's\nthe purpose of the Harvard plan that was attached.\nQUESTION: Not today, I'm sure. But -- but --\nbut that was its origin.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, there is -- there is\ncertainly a major difference between an educational policy\nthat is motivated by an intent to exclude people based on\nracial animus and one like the Law School's policy and the\nHarvard plan, which is designed to include students of all\nraces, so that the education of all students will be\nenriched as a result.\nQUESTION: But not too many of any race?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Or not too many of any religion, I\nassume?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor it is not a question of\nnot too many. It's that the law school has attempted to\ntake race into account in a very modest limited fashion,\nno more than necessary to achieve the goal of trying to\nhave sufficient numbers of minorities that there can be an\nexcellent educational experience for everyone.\nQUESTION: But -- but without a quota? Just\nsufficient numbers, but that's not a quota?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor it is not a quota.\nQUESTION: When you say sufficient numbers,\nyou're -- I mean that suggests to me that there is --\nthere is some minimum. Now, you don't name it. But there\nhas to be some minimum. But you say there isn't a\nminimum?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor there is not a minimum.\nQUESTION: Well, then you have to eliminate the\nword sufficient.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, it -- it can be\nrelated to numbers without being a quota.\nDepartment of Education in 1979 after Bakke came out,\nissued a policy interpretation at 44 Federal register\n58510 which specifically says authorizes schools to\nestablish and pursue numerical goals, end quote, as long\nas they don't set aside a fixed number of places or make\nrace the sole criterion for eligibility. That was the\nDepartment of Education's interpretation.\nQUESTION: Certainly they don't interpret the\nConstitution?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, they don't Your Honor, but\nthat is what Bakke held. That was -- that was the -- what\nwas at issue in that case, that that was the difference\nbetween the program that U C Davis had used and the\nprogram that was at issue in the Harvard plan.\nQUESTION: Is it fair to say that the -- what\nthe -- what -- what Justice Powell and the five who agreed\nor the four who agreed on the Harvard plan were getting at\nwas that there is a permissible zone between a purely\ntoken number and a quota or a set aside and you can shoot\nfor something in that zone? Is that a fair --\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely Your Honor. What\nJustice Powell's opinion says when paraphrasing the\nHarvard plan is that there needs to be an awareness of the\nnecessity for more than token numbers. And that's because\nthe educational benefits of diversity can't be achieved.\nQUESTION: It's hard to see that that's --\nthat's true here, when every day the admission staff looks\nto see what the numbers are based on race?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that's not correct.\nThe -- there is a report which is called The Daily. But\nit is not looked at everyday. The evidence was clear that\nit is simply something that can be printed out.\nQUESTION: You just have a daily report that\nthey look at once a week?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the reason it's called\na daily is that it is a running database that allows for\nthe report to be printed at any time.\nAnd -- and the evidence indicated that --\nQUESTION: To show how well they're doing in\ngetting the so-called critical mass which is just a\nsynonym for a number?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the dailies actually\ntrack a whole variety of admissions information including\ndeposits, they're trying to see how they're doing in terms\nof whether --\nQUESTION: They -- they don't track, as I\nunderstand it, the other pluses that the University talks\nabout?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, they track -- they track\nresidency, they track gender, they don't track, for\ninstance, socioeconomic status which is a plus or, in\nfact, the evidence is uncontradicted that the University\ntakes any racial background, any ethnic background, any\nunusual characteristic that would add to the diversity of\nthe class into account, but it doesn't find a need to\ntrack that, because of the nature of the applicant pool.\nQUESTION: Is two percent a critical mass, Ms.\nMahoney?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. Four percent?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, what --\nQUESTION: You have to pick some number, don't\nyou?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, actually what --\nQUESTION: Like eight, is eight percent?\nMS. MAHONEY: Now, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Now, does it stop being a quota\nbecause it's somewhere between 8 and 12, but it is a quota\nif it's 10? I don't understand that reasoning. Once you\nuse the term critical mass and -- you're -- you're into\nquota land?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, what a quota is under\nthis Court's cases is a fixed number. And there is no\nfixed number here. The testimony was that it depends on\nthe characteristics of the applicant pool.\nQUESTION: As long as you say between 8 and 12,\nyou're okay? Is that it? If you said 10 it's bad you but\nbetween 8 and 12 it's okay, because it's not a fixed\nnumber? Is that -- that's what you think the Constitution\nis?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, if it was a fixed\nrange that said that it will be a minimum of 8 percent,\ncome hell or high water, no matter what the qualifications\nof these applicants look like, no matter what it is that\nthe majority applicants could contribute to the benefits\nof diversity, then certainly that would be a quota, but\nthat is not what occurred here. And in fact the testimony\nwas undisputed, that this was not intended to be a fixed\ngoal.\nQUESTION: Ms. Mahoney may I shift focus away\nfrom this to another point before you're finished, that I\nam concerned about. In all programs which this Court has\nupheld in the area of -- you want to label it affirmative\naction, there's been a fixed time period within which it\nwould operate. You could see at the end -- an end to it,\nthere is none in this, is there? How do we deal with that\naspect?\nMS. MAHONEY: What the policy says, of course,\nis that it will only take race into account as long as it\nis necessary in order to achieve the educational\nobjectives.\nI don't think that this Court should conclude\nthat this is permanent, because there are two things that\ncan happen that will make this come to an end. The first\nis that the number of high-achieving minorities will\ncontinue to grow and that law school will be able to\nenroll a sufficient number to have a critical mass or\nmeaningful numbers or substantial presence without having\nto take race into account.\nThe second thing that can happen, Your Honor, is\nthat we could reach a point in our society where the\nexperience of being a minority did not make such a\nfundamental difference in their lives, where race didn't\nmatter so much that it's truly salient to the law school's\neducational mission.\nWhile that I can't say when that will happen, we\ncertainly know that as a nation, we have made tremendous\nprogress in overcoming intolerance. And we certainly\nshould expect that that will occur with respect to\nminorities.\nQUESTION: We approved any other affirmative\naction program with such a vague distant termination base?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, in Bakke itself, Your Honor.\nIn Bakke itself, there were five votes to allow the\nUniversity of California Davis to use a plan modeled on\nthe Harvard plan. It's been in effect for about 25 years.\nIt has reaped extraordinary benefits for this country's\neducational system.\nAnd I think it's far too soon for this Court to\ninclude that --\nQUESTION: Can -- can we tell from the\nstatistics whether things have been improved say, more and\nmore minorities are getting in on their own to the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School without the quotas?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Or whether --\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, they're not quotas, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: The critical mass?\nMS. MAHONEY: We do know -- aspirations --\nQUESTION: Aspirations.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- but we do know Your Honor that\nthere has been improvement, in fact, Justice Powell cited\nto a study, it was done by Manning it's in footnote 50 of\nJustice Powell's opinion and it gives the number of\nminorities who had achieved a 165 and a 3.5 on the LSAT.\nQUESTION: How about say the last 15 years, at\nthe University of Michigan, which wasn't being under\nconsideration which Justice Powell's opinion?\nMS. MAHONEY:\nwe do know that in 1964 when there was a race-blind\npolicy, there were no blacks admitted, and under a\nrace-blind policy today, probably six blacks would be\nadmitted without consideration of race.\nSo there has not been enough progress to allow\nfor meaningful numbers at this point, but there has been\nprogress.\nQUESTION: Do we know what's happened in the law\nschools in California since it was determined by State law\naffirmative action?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor. We know that for\nthe first -- I think, 4 or 5 years, both only enrolled\nabout -- between I think zero and 7 African-American\nstudents. They do better on Hispanics because of the\ndemographics of that State, where it's virtually 50\npercent Hispanic at the college-age level. But what we\nhave learned is that in the -- they changed their program\n2 years ago and this fall they succeeded in enrolling 14\nAfrican-American students, but what we know from talking\nto the law school admissions counsel with Boalt's\npermission is that the African-Americans who were enrolled\nunder that program have a 9 point LSAT score gap from the\nwhites who have been enrolled, so the same gap --\nQUESTION: Well, there are other law schools in\nCalifornia, too, are there not?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, UCLA, well, this is mainly a\nproblem Your Honor for the highly selective schools\nbecause of the nature of the pool.\nQUESTION: You have some good law schools, you\nhave UCLA, you have USC?\nMS. MAHONEY: UCLA.\nQUESTION: SC is private?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: But UCLA?\nMR. KOLBO: UCLA -- UCLA had -- the class that's\ngraduatiing this year, for instance, I believe had five\nblacks in it. So I believe last fall they did better and\nwe have been told that that's because they were able to\nrecruit some additional numbers of black students because\nof a special critical race studies program they're\noffering but that's not a solution to the pool problem,\nYour Honor.\nThe pool problem is that if we look at the\nranges of LSATs where the University of Michigan takes its\nstudents, there are literally about 30 in the entire\ncountry, three or four per top 10 schools.\nSo some kind of, you know, race-conscious\nrecruiting that schools are using doesn't solve that\nproblem.\nAnd if I could go back to Boalt for just another\nminute, because that is something that the petitioners\nraised in their reply brief, is that given that we know\nthat they have exactly the same nine-point LSAT gap that\nMichigan gets under its program, there is no reason to\nthink that what they are doing would satisfy the\npetitioner's conception of the Equal Protection Clause.\nQUESTION: That's difficult when it's not in the\nrecord.\nI do have one more question on this quota point.\nI don't think the answer that you gave to\nJustice Scalia was in -- in all respects complete. You\nsaid well, if -- if there were a program that no matter\nwhat you used a somewhat different phrase, no matter what,\nthere would be people taken regardless of qualifications\n-- that would be a quota.\nSuppose the pool is large enough so that you can\nfind minorities to fill your 15 percent aspiration. Why\nisn't that a quota even if they're qualified?\nMS. MAHONEY: Because, Your Honor I think --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that that was a -- a\nreally a false -- or an improper qualification that you\ngave to your answer?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nBecause I think -- certainly if it's a fixed number that\nyou're going to take no matter what, then that is a quota,\nbut I think the difference between a quota and a goal is\nthe flexibility.\nAnd what this Court, for instance, said in\nJohnson when talking about, they authorized the use of a\ngoal and they said that the line between a goal and a\nquota is in fact whether or not you have to automatically\nand blindly promote people in order to meet the goal or\nwhether it is a factor that is taken into account and\nthat's exactly what occurs here.\nQUESTION: How does the University determine\nfrom one year to the next, you say some years it'll come\nout eight percent, some year nine percent, do they make a\nconscious decision?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, the evidence shows\n--\nQUESTION: Just toss a coin?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, it's not tossing a coin, but\nit is not a fixed number. What they do is, they look --\nit's responsive to the applicant pool. They look at the\napplicants, they are looking at a variety of factors on a\nholistic basis and they find the applicants that they\nthink are going to bring the most in toto to the law\nschool class, but it is not measured against a specific\nnumerical target. And the district court did not find\notherwise.\nIt is simply looking at that pool and what\nMichigan is --\nQUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, do you know any quota\nprogram that would take somebody to fill the quota no\nmatter what? All the quota programs I know start off by\nsaying we will only take qualified applicants, but then\nsetting the level of qualified low enough that they can\nfill the quota. I don't know any program that said no\nmatter what we're going to fill this quota.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: To establish that kind of a standard\nfor quota is -- is to -- is to just eliminate the -- the\nwhole purpose of -- of that aspect of our law.\nMS. MAHONEY: Actually, Your Honor, the way that\nin Bakke it worked, it wasn't the situation that they\nwould take someone no matter what, but they did have a\nrule, that you could not be considered for the spaces that\nhad been set aside if you were white. And so it works in a\nvery different way, Your Honor.\nThere -- Bakke applied, there were four spaces\navailable in the special admissions program, but he\ncouldn't be considered for them, because of his race.\nThat doesn't happen at the University of\nMichigan. When someone applies, whether they're white, it\ndoesn't matter how many minorities have been accepted or\nrejected. They are considered on their merits just like\nevery other applicant. That's the defining difference\nbetween what happened in the UC Davis program.\nQUESTION: But they aren't just like every\napplicant. Some applicants are given a preference because\nof their race.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, they are given extra\nweight in the process, because they have something unusual\nand important to bring to the class. That's what every --\nthat's the way every applicant is considered and --\nQUESTION: Which you say automatically follows\nfrom race?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, they also write essays\nabout diversity. Every applicant is given the chance to\nwrite an essay about diversity. The law school does --\nQUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, how does the Michigan\nplan differ or the Harvard plan, for that matter, from\nwhat was familiar, that is, highly selected schools will\nreject a certain number of people, take a number of people\nas automatic acceptance and in the large middle will say,\nwell, we'll -- we'll take people because they're\ndifferent, because they play the bassoon, because they\nbelong to a minority race? Because in the days that when\nI went to law school, they are female, because we want the\nclass to be diverse and so they used race, they used sex,\nthey used --\nMS. MAHONEY: That's exactly what the University\nof Michigan Law School plan does. It looks at all\npotential contributions to diversity. And what the\nevidence shows in this case is that it is common for white\napplicants to be admitted with lower grades and test\nscores than even minorities who are rejected because --\nQUESTION: Does the Constitution prohibit\ndiscrimination against -- against oboe players as opposed\nto flute players?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Does it prohibit discrimination on\nthe basis of alumna status?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But it does prohibit disrimination on\nthe basis of race?\nMS. MAHONEY: But the question is whether this\nis prohibited discrimination. And the answer that we\nwould ask this Court to give is that a minority applicant\nbrings something special. They are not similarly situated\nto the white applicant who has the exact same grades and\ntest scores.\nQUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, may I ask you a question\nthat is really prompted by Justice O'Connor's question\nabout the terminal point in all of this?\nhoping some day race will be a totally irrelevant factor\nin all decisions. One of the arguments on the other side\nof your case is that there's actually -- these programs\nactually generate racial hostility particularly on the\npart of the excluded members. And that in turn delays the\nultimate day we are all hoping for.\nWhat is your comment about that?\nMS. MAHONEY: The record certainly does not\nsupport that inference under this program. And the reason\nis this: The program -- one of the ways to prevent that\nfrom happening is to have a narrowly tailored program to\nhave very limited consideration of race and not to, for\ninstance, have two great a disparity between the\nqualifications of the white students who are admitted and\nthe minority students who are admitted under the program.\nHere it's actually quite limited. In fact, you know, the\nvast -- the most -- the most of the minorities who are\nadmitted are in the top 16 percent of all LSAT takers in\nthe country. So we're talking about a really exceptional\ngroup of students.\nBy keeping the relative qualifications fairly\nclose, like that, you really minimize the potential for\nany kind of stigmatizing or hostility, that sort of thing.\nAnd what the record shows is that in the Orfield\nstudy which was done of Harvard and University of\nMichigan's students, it's in the record at Exhibit 167,\nthat there is overwhelming support by the students at\nHarvard and Michigan Law Schools for maintaining the\ndiversity program, because they regard it as so positive.\nThat's --\nQUESTION: Sure, they're in already.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor that's for the --\nQUESTION: The people you want to talk to are\nthe high school seniors who have seen -- who have seen\npeople visibly less qualified than they are get into\nprestigious institutions where they are rejected. If you\nthink that is not creating resentment, you are just wrong.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, certainly the\nminorities who have been admitted under the program are\nnot feeling stigmatized by it. If they continue to\nsupport the program in the ways that they do. In\naddition, the whites who are seeing their performance in\nthe class and who are confirming that they find it highly\nbeneficial to have the -- the chance to share the\nexperiences of the minority students when they are\nlearning about the law, has to be given substantial weight\nin considering whether this is somehow stigmatizing or\nperpetuating historic stereotypes, which is really the\ntest that this Court used in VMI to determine whether or\nnot something really should be condemned because of its\npotential to stigmatize.\nQUESTION: If Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke\ncan be viewed as, yes, you can use race as a plus factor,\nwhere the program is not against anyone, but you cannot go\ntoo far, and it says individualized consideration is\nnecessary there, what in your opinion would be going too\nfar, other than quotas? How would this be maintained\nwithin limits?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think there are really three\nthings other than a quota to look for. The first is\nwhether there is flexible consideration of the diversity\ncontributions of every potential student, which Michigan\nprogram clearly satisfies, whether the minorities who are\nbeing admitted are well qualified, because you don't want\nto have a situation where they can't contribute to the\nclass and can't succeed, and the third is the degree of\nthe burden on the rejected applicants, that's certainly\nrelevant under any narrow tier learning program. And\nhere, what the record tells us is that 95 percent of all\nthe admissions decisions that are made each year are not\naffected by the consideration of race.\nThat the chance -- that there are about 2500\nstudents who are rejected each year probably only 80 of\nthem would have been -- would have gotten an offer of\nadmission from Michigan under a race-blind system.\nThat is a very small and diffuse burden. It's\nnot one to be minimized. It's certainly something that\nthe Court has to pay attention to, but this is extremely\nlimited in scope and relative to the benefits to students\nof all races and to our Nation. It has to be weighed in\nthe balance and this Court certainly should conclude that\nthe interests that are being served, the legitimate\ninterests that are being served are sufficiently\ncompelling to allow this kind of limited consideration of\nrace.\nQUESTION: Do we know what would be the increase\nof the named Plaintiffs, the increase in their chance of\nadmission, were there no affirmative action programs?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't know what the increase for\nthe -- for Barbara Grutter would have been, for instance,\nwe do know that across the class, it would have been\napproximately 5 percent.\nOne might say that that could vary, you know, by\nindividual. The record evidence would indicate, however,\nthat Barbara Grutter would not have been admitted under a\nrace-blind program, although that issue has not been\nlitigated to conclusion.\nQUESTION: I don't know any other area where we\n-- where we decide the case by saying well, there are very\nfew people who are being treated unconstitutionally.\nI mean, if this indeed is an unconstitutional\ntreatment of -- of this woman, because of her race,\nsurely, it doesn't make any difference whether she is one\nof very few who have been treated unconstitutionally.\nQUESTION: I think you can regard that as a\nstatement rather than a question.\nMS. MAHONEY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Kolbo, you have\ntwo minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK KOLBO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nTHE WITNESS: Thank you, if I may follow-up on\nthe last question.\nCounsel's answer to the last couple of\nquestions, I think, really crystallizes the difference\nbetween their position and ours. The University of\nMichigan sees this as a question of group rights. There\nare rights on the part of minorities. And there are\nrights -- there are rights on the part of whites and\nAsians and other -- other groups.\nWe see it very differently. The Constitution\nprotects the rights of individuals, not racial groups.\nThe Bakke case opening up 16 spaces in the class\nwhen that system was struck down meant that about 2,500\nstudents, 2,500 to 3,000 students who had previously been\ndiscriminated against now had an opportunity to compete\nfor those seats.\nSo it seems to me the question is not answered\nby how many have been discriminated against.\nThe question is whether in fact discrimination\nis occurring against the individual and it certainly is in\nthis particular case.\nCounsel was asked some questions about the\nopen-ended nature of the policy at issue here. And I\nthink it's very critical that we understand that if the\ninterests that they are asserting here to be compelling is\nupheld as compelling by this Court, we have in fact the\nfirst indefinite, ongoing, unlimited compelling interest.\nThe Court previously has confined its analysis\nto remedying -- remedying identified discrimination. A\nremedy based on societal discrimination or a role-model\ntheory for example in Wygant. A couple of the reasons\nthat the Court struck down those rationals was because\nthey were so unlimited, so amorphus, indefinite with\nrespect to time.\nThat certainly is the case with the interest\nthat is being urged here today.\nAnd it seems to me that that is -- it becomes\nvery clear in the University's argument that what they've\ndone -- and they didn't argue so much this in the lower\ncourt, but they made it very clear that their\njustification for the preferences is based in effect on\nremedying societal discrimination.\nTheir argument and their briefs and in this\nCourt has been that when the day comes, someday and maybe\nit will come someday, we hope that it will, that someday\nthat we will be able to stop using race for these\npurposes.\nAnd the opinion that accepted that rationale it\nseems to me would be a dramatic step backward from this\nCourt's precedents which have rejected the notion that\nsomething as amorphus as societal discrimination would be\nsufficient.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Kolbo.\n"
