        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 12-135, Oxford Health\nPlans v. Florida.\nMr. Waxman?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Stolt-Nielsen, this Court held first that\na party may not be compelled to submit to arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that\nthe party agreed to do so. And second, that because\nclass arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to\nsuch a degree that it cannot be presumed that parties\nconsented to class arbitration simply by agreeing to\nsubmit their disputes to an arbitrator. That precisely\ndescribes this case.\nThe agreement commits the parties to submit\ntheir disputes to arbitration and says nothing about\nclass arbitration. There is no extrinsic evidence\nsuggesting that the parties ever considered such a\nprospect, and there is no background principle of State\nlaw that favors it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- about the parties\nnever considering it, when this case was in the New\nJersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red\nbrief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then,\nthat \"the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether\nthe parties contemplated class arbitration in their\nagreements.\" A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does\nnot contest. Does it -- that seems to be a recognition\nby Oxford that -- that class arbitration was\ncontemplated.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, two\nthings. First of all, if you look at page 10 -- or page\n14, footnote 7 of our yellow brief, you'll see all of\nthe references made in the advocacy before the State\ncourt judge by my -- my brother here, not recognizing\nrepeatedly that what Oxford was asking for was a\ndismissal and a transfer to individual arbitration -\nbilateral arbitration.\nThere was no mistake, whatsoever, in the New\nJersey State courts that Oxford's position was that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your answer.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes -- that bilateral\narbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was\nsimilarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly\nOxford took the position based on an understanding of\nNew Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't\ndecided class action question, that the decision would\nbe submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as\nit was in Stolt-Nielsen.\nYes, Justice Sotomayor. I apologize.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question. Did\nyou never -- you never argued that it was beyond the\npower of the arbitrator to decide this question, did\nyou?\nMR. WAXMAN: In the first instance, no.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And do you take the\nposition that this is a -- always an arbitrator's\nquestion when all disputes are supposed to be submitted,\nor was just -- was there just a mistake here?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think there was a\nmistake here. I think it was -- it was understandable,\nin light of the state of the law in 2002. But we -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why should we rewrite\nour standard of review to accommodate your client's\nerror? Because that's really what you're asking us to\ndo.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: More than once we have\nsaid an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that\nan arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are\nnot asking the Court to vary in any material respect the\nhighly deferential standard that's reflected in Section\n10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nBut we are asking that that generally\napplicable standard of review be applied to a question\nwith a very strong empirical presumption that the FAA\nhas attached to it and this Court has announced, which\nis, that absent an actual agreement by the contracting\nparties that they will permit their disputes to be\narbitrated on a class basis, an inference that may not,\nas a matter of Federal law, be derived from an agreement\nto submit all disputes to arbitration -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So your rule is that\nalthough we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation\nof the contract, in this case, there is an exception\nbecause?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, in this case, you defer,\nas you always do, but you -- you have to provide -\nthere is some level of review. It's not just because\nthe arbitrator says I've looked at the contract and I\nthink this.\nAs this Court has said over and over again,\nincluding in Stolt, just saying something is so doesn't\nmake it so. There is deferential review, but there is\nreview. And the review is of a proposition that this\nCourt has now said twice strongly presumes that there\nis -- there is no agreement to arbitrate as a class\nunless it is clearly shown to be so and that that\nshowing is not satisfied by an all-disputes clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so we make that rule\njust with reference to the word \"arbitration\" when it's\nin the class action context, or does this apply to other\nwords as well?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm just not sure\nwhat the -\nMR. WAXMAN: So I -- I think -- I mean, this\nCourt has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the\nquestion of class versus bilateral arbitration is a\nspecial kind of question under the FAA as to which the\nFederal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of\ndecision.\nAnd therefore, the question I suppose is,\nwhen a court looks at a -- an assertion by an arbitrator\nthat the language of the contract permits -- and in this\ncase, the arbitrator found that it required class\narbitration, a court has to ascertain whether that\nassertion of fact is at least plausible, or, to use the\nvernacular of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, the Court\nsaid in Stolt-Nielsen that the stipulation left no room\nfor an argument that the parties had agreed.\nAnd similarly here, the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no -- in\nStolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract\nsaid nothing on the issue of class proceeding. In this\ncase, we have no such stipulations -\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the arbitrator is\ninterpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule\nis that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's\ninterpretation of a contract term, wrong or right,\nunless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -\neveryone agrees in this case, as one would have to,\nbased on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the -\nthis arbitration clause in this case just said all\ndisputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the\narbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed\nif it -- if he found that that indicated an actual\nagreement of the parties to class arbitration. That is\ninconsistent with the actual holding in Stolt-Nielsen.\nAnd in this case, that sentence is\nindistinguishable from that orthodox clause. All that\nwe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're saying\nthat this is off the wall. That's your -- to put it\nin -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, not to be pejorative, but\nI would say this, in the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen,\nthis language, quote, \"leaves no room\" for a conclusion\nthat the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying -- you're\nsaying that the -- that the deference which we give to\narbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we\ngive to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a\nlimit, that at some point, the distortion of fact\nbecomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact,\nright?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. And in this case, a\nquestion of Federal arbitration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have other examples\nfrom other -- other review that we've given to\narbitrators' factual decisions?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I -- I don't want\nto adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but\nif -- if you're telling me this is just a general\nprinciple, that at some point if it's too much off the\nwall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can\nreverse it. What -- what other examples do -- do we\nhave?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, let me -- let me -- let\nme refer you to Stolt-Nielsen first, and then to a\nhypothetical example that my brother gives.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I want a case.\nYou're -\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. Stolt-Nielsen said --\nI -- I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that is a class action\ncase. I -- I don't care what it said. I want a -\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, you mean a non-class action\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I want a case where we\nhave, or where Federal courts have with our approval,\ndisregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator\nbecause the factual finding was too much off the wall.\nThat there was simply not enough basis to support it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, I can't -- I'm\nsort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration\ndecisions. I can't -- there may be. I can't think of a\nholding of this -- well, no, I guess -- I guess First\nOptions is an example in which the arbitrator found that\nthe parties had agreed to let the arbitrator decide the\narbitrability question. And this Court held that that\nwas wrong as a matter of fact.\nThe Court reviewed the -- the facts of the\ncase and said there is no way that the Kaplans agreed to\nhave the arbitrability question submitted.\nAnd if I may -- I realize this isn't an\nactual case -- but my brother gives the example of a\nform of deferential review, which would allow a court to\nexamine and reverse an arbitrator's decision in the\ncontext in which the arbitration agreement says, this is\ngoing to be arbitrated under California law, and the\narbitrator says, well, I'm going to apply New York law\nin this case because -- I don't know, the parties have\nall moved to New York and they like New York and they\nlitigate in New York.\nMy brother says that is reviewable and\nreversible. And that's exactly what we have here. We\nhave here a clause that this Court has said cannot\nsuffice to establish actual agreement to arbitrate as a\nclass.\nAnd the arbitrator has said nonetheless, I\nhave read it that way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but it's not\nexactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for\narbitration. It is not the standard boilerplate so you\ncould say when he interprets it, he's really making a\ndecision about arbitrability. And you can follow -- I\nmean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with\nit -- but you understand the reasoning. It says, no\ncivil action be brought, all such disputes will go to\narbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil\naction, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore,\nit's there.\nNow, you -- you may not agree with it, but\nit -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of\nthe language rather than a general rule.\nMR. WAXMAN: The fact -- the fact that the\narbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses. One\nsays, you cannot bring a civil action in court about any\ndispute under this agreement, you must settle your\ndisputes in arbitration, is completely orthodox.\nAnd as we point out at page 24, note 3 of\nour blue brief, it's quite arguably required by New\nJersey law and laws of other States that say to be\nperfectly -- it is -- you have to be perfectly clear\nwhen you are telling a contract -- a contracting\ncounterparty that disputes will be arbitrated. You have\nto tell them that that means that they cannot bring\ntheir disputes in court.\nAnd a rule -- a reading of this -- I mean,\nI -- I submit to you that, consistent with grammar and\nordinary meaning of words, it cannot be plausibly read\nto say that you can't bring a civil action about any\ndispute in court means that you can -- you are agreeing\nto arbitrate your dispute on a class basis, for a whole\nvariety of reasons.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, can I just ask\nyou what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4)\nbecause my understanding of the standard was that a\ncourt had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his\npowers, was acting outside the scope of his authority -\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And that we have said quite\na number of times that the fact that the arbitrator\ncommitted an error and even a serious error is not\nenough, that he had to be doing something that was\nsimply outside the scope of his authority. Do you agree\nwith that or disagree with that? And if you disagree\nwith that, what's your standard for what we should be\nthinking about in -- under 10(a)(4).\nMR. WAXMAN: I agree with that as a\nproposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is\nwhether the arbitrator exceeded his authority. In this\ncase, in the context of the question about actual\nagreement to arbitrate on a class -- as a class, this\nCourt has interpreted Federal law to require evidence of\na contractual basis of actual agreement between the\nparties and has precluded, as a matter of Federal law,\nan arbitrator from inferring such agreement from an\nall-disputes clause.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And you don't disagree, do\nyou, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion,\nyou might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's\ndoing is trying to construe a contract.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that -- I mean, trying\nI think is not a defense. What I would say, in\naddition -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but he is going -- but\nhe's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure\nout what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit\nstatement about what the parties agreed on.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right, but he did not take\ncognizance of the holding of this Court in\nStolt-Nielsen, reiterated in Concepcion, that you may\nnot infer intent from an agreement to submit to\narbitration. And more fundamentally, he did not heed\nthe presumption in the Federal -- under the Federal\nArbitration Act that this Court's holdings in those two\ncases reflects.\nThat is, there -- this Court said in\nConcepcion that it would be hard to imagine that -- hard\nto believe that defendants would ever bet the company\nwith no effective means of review.\nThere is therefore a presumption in the law\nthat, absent a very clear statement of a meeting of the\nparties' minds there is no consent. But he indulged the\nopposite presumption. His presumption was -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So now you're saying that he\nexceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of\nclear statement presumption. But I don't think that\nwe've ever suggested that there is such a clear\nstatement presumption. In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that\nif the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed\non anything, then we're not going to accept class\narbitration.\nBut we've not said that in the process of\nconstruing an agreement there is a clear statement rule.\nNow, maybe we should have said that, but -- you know,\nit's -- it's no place in our case law now.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Kagan -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Am I wrong?\nMR. WAXMAN: We are not -- you didn't say\nthe words \"clear statement.\" You -- what you said in\nStolt-Nielsen -- what you held in Stolt-Nielsen was not\nsimply that parties who have stipulated can't be forced\ninto class arbitration. What you held was that you\ncannot have class arbitration in the absence of\naffirmative agreement that is not evidenced by an\nall-disputes clause. And the -- that background -- that\nstrong presumption must, as a matter of Federal law,\ninform the arbitrator's decision.\nAnd in this case, not only didn't it because\nyou said, look, an all-disputes clause doesn't suffice.\nAnd he said, well, there's the word \"civil action\" in\nhere and I think that that not only suffices, but that\nindicates an actual agreement to require class\narbitration. That doesn't pass any test. It doesn't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a combination of\nthe two provisions. He said that everything that is\nexcluded by the first provision is included in the\nsecond. And he also said something, which may or may\nnot be so. He said that this particular way of\ndescribing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an\nunusual wording. We have -- there's no civil action in\nthe first clause and then arbitration in the second. He\nsaid that he had never seen this particular language.\nIs he wrong in -- in saying that this language is\nunusual?\nMR. WAXMAN: Arbitration clauses that say,\nin one form of words or another, that you may not bring\nany dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to\narbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace. There was\na -- there was a clause in the Steelworkers' trilogy. I\nmean, they -- there's a lot of citation to Enterprise\nWheel in this case.\nThe -- the provision in -- in the\nSteelworkers agreement, and virtually all labor\nagreements, make this explicit. It's not precisely\nevery single article and preposition in the clause here,\nbut it is functionally indistinct. The same was true -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was this -- was this a -\nwell, was this an experienced arbitrator?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- so far as the record\nshows, yes. But my -- whether he was right or wrong\nabout this, I submit to you two things: Number one,\nthere is no way -- three things:\nNumber one, there is no way consistent with\nthe rules of grammar that one can read this sentence as\nsending class actions to arbitration -- requiring class\narbitration.\nNumber two, there is no heed by the\narbitrator -- Number two is that -- that for all intents\nand purposes this clause is the clause that is orthodox,\nthat was at issue in Stolt-Nielsen. It's the same as\nthe one the Fifth Circuit decided and the Second Circuit\ndecided in the cases -- the other cases that created the\nsplit here. It's the same as the standard labor clause\nthat was at issue in the Steelworkers v. Enterprise\nWheel.\nAnd -- and this is my other point -- it is\nplain from the arbitrator's decisions, both in his 2003\ndecision and his post-Stolt-Nielsen 2010 decision, that\nhe not only was not applying the Federal law presumption\nthat this Court identified in Stolt and Concepcion, but\nhe was applying the opposite presumption.\nHe said in 2003 that because -- if this -\nif this clause wouldn't be construed to permit or\nrequire class arbitration, it would mean that the\nparties had agreed not to resolve their disputes in any\nforum using a class manner, and that would be, quote,\n\"so bizarre, it would require an express provision.\"\nIn 2010, he said, well, I overshot the mark\nhere. But the point is still the same. And this is on\npage 41a -- 40a and 41a of the petition appendix. He\nsaid, the -- the point is that if he is not allowed to\nbring a class proceeding in arbitration when he at least\npresumptively was in State court, that would be so\nstrange that, \"If the clause,\" and I'm quoting from the\nsecond full paragraph on 41a, \"If the clause cannot\npermit Dr. Sutter's court class action to go to\narbitration, then Dr. Sutter's original class action\nmust be outside of the arbitration agreement\naltogether.\"\nIn other words, he was indulging a\npresumption that it is so unnatural -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that comes under\nour basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was\nbetween this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties\nhere and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether\nor not this language, that says nothing about it, did\nencompass class or not.\nIn Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted\narbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about\nit. So, given his concession there, the only way it\ncould have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some\npolicy thing. Given the lack of any similar concession\nhere, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read\nthis ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and\nsaid, hmm, guess it's in.\nNow, in the latter case, we should presume\neverything from the arbitrator's favor. Former case,\nno, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause.\nOkay. So that -- now, what's the response to that?\nMR. WAXMAN: So the arbitrator -- so a\ncouple of responses. The arbitrators in Stolt-Nielsen\ndidn't apply -- didn't construe AnimalFeeds' lawyers'\nconcession at oral argument before the arbitrators the\nsame way this Court did. What it said was that it is\nlooking at the language of the contract and as this\nCourt's majority opinion points out, there are several\ntextual references in the arbitrators' decision, and\nthey decided, well, we're interpreting this, applying, I\nthink they said, New York principles, that the parties\ndidn't agree to preclude it, therefore, they must be\nunderstood to have permitted it.\nWhat this Court said is, as a matter of law,\nno. Silence doesn't mean consent. Consent can only be\nshown in this type of decision by an actual agreement.\nThe Court italicized the word \"agreement\" twice in its\nopinion. And it doesn't show actual agreement if you\njust agree to arbitrate, not litigate, your disputes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Out of curiosity,\nMr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator\npaid? Is the arbitrator paid by the hour or a flat fee?\nMR. WAXMAN: I am not sure, Justice Alito,\nif the record shows. I believe it's by the hour.\nThe -- the point is that what this\nCourt's -- the fact that there was a stipulation that\nthe Court identified in Stolt-Nielsen made it easier to\napply the principle that you -- that -- that actual\nagreement is required, but you can't infer it from an\nall-disputes clause to the case. The Court said that\nthe stipulation, quote, \"left no room for an inquiry\nregarding the parties' consent.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, how wrong\ndoes an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an\nissue of law? Meaning -- because that's the rule you're\nproposing. I used to think that exceeding your powers\nwas deciding an issue the parties hadn't agreed to\narbitrate, but here you've conceded that you gave the\nissue to the arbitrator. So he hasn't exceeded his\npower to construe the contract with respect to this\ndispute, do you agree with that?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, I do, but -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what\ninstead you're saying is that \"exceeded your powers\"\nmeans that an error the arbitrator makes has to be of\nwhat quality?\nMR. WAXMAN: If you -- so if you -- an\narbitrator exceeds his powers if it -- if he decides to\narbitrate a subject matter that the parties have not\nagreed to arbitrate. He -- he exceeds -- he or she\nexceeds his or her power if they -- if he or she\ndecides, as this Court stated in Stolt-Nielsen, that you\nagreed to arbitrate with someone with whom you didn't\nagree to arbitrate. That is this case.\nAnd as I said, we are not at the -- if you\nasked -- I don't -- I would apply -- I think you could\nsimply apply the standard that you've applied in\nStolt-Nielsen, which is the \"leave no room\" standard,\nwhich is pretty darn deferential, and you would have to\nfind that this sentence, in light of Federal law as\nannounced by Stolt-Nielsen, leaves no room for a\nconclusion that the parties, that Oxford and Dr. Sutter,\nactually agreed to class arbitration regarding their\ndisputes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, of course, this\nwas -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no -\nit was drafted by Oxford. And you made a point about\nbetting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed\nto it. But on the side of the doctor, he has a\n$10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without\na class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no\nmeans to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none\nof these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000\ndoctors, none of them could enforce the contract because\nthe expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they\ncould get at the end.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, neither the\narbitrator nor any of the courts below made any finding\nabout whether this is a contract of adhesion or whether\nthis is a so-called negative value case.\nThere was litigation over Federal court\nsubject matter jurisdiction and the court found that\nthere was, in part based on evidence that Oxford\nsubmitted, that there were many claims that were far in\nexcess of $75,000. And it is not true that Dr. Sutter's\nclaims as he brought them to arbitration was $1,000 or\nanything like it.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Katz?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. KATZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KATZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start out by discussing the\napplicable standard. There are only two ways a losing\nparty can vacate an arbitration award under 10(a)(4),\nwhich is the only standard that applies here. It's the\nonly question that came up to this Court on cert and -\nunder the exceeding powers standard. Number one, the\narbitrator had no authority to interpret the contract;\nor number 2, the award was based not on an\ninterpretation of the contract.\nOxford cannot satisfy either of those\nstandards here. Oxford does not dispute that the\narbitrator interpreted the contract. Oxford's sole\ndispute here or challenge is that the -- that the\narbitrator interpreted the contract incorrectly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's all he has\nto do is saying -- you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the\ncontract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?\nMR. KATZ: Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we were\nconcerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company\nbetting the company, right, on -- on class action\nwhenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration because\nclass arbitration -- you know, will bankrupt the company\nand without an appeal to the court or -- you know,\nnot -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway. And you're\nsaying that, in effect, you do bet the company every\ntime.\nSo long as you leave it up to the arbitrator\nto decide whether there's a class action allowed or not,\nwhich most agreements probably do, he can find whatever\nhe likes, right? He can find -- so long as he says, I'm\ninterpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly\ninconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's\nnothing the courts can do about it.\nMR. KATZ: Justice Scalia, Stolt-Nielsen\ntaught us that the language of the contract or any other\nevidence has to demonstrate the -- that the parties\nagreed to class arbitration. Stolt-Nielsen did not\nalter this 10(a)(4) standard, the same standard which\nbefore it was codified -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that standard\n-- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to\nsay is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what\nhe says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to\nwhat the contract says, and the court has to accept\nthat, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.\nMR. KATZ: This Court's jurisprudence for\nalmost 2 centuries has held just exactly that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just exactly that?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't think so. I\nthought it said that -- that the award -- if the award\ndisplays manifest disregard, or words like that. I\nmean, Misco is -- is not absolute. Misco has a narrow\nexception, and that exception is where there's just no\nbasis in the contract for the decision. And so I\nthought you were arguing that here that's clearly not\nso, there is a basis.\nMR. KATZ: Well, there -- well, there is a\nbasis. What Misco -- as I understand what Misco teaches\nis that it has to be unambiguous, that the arbitrator -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a different thing,\nthat's a different thing. It doesn't say whatever he\nsays about the contract, he wins. It says what he says\nabout the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it\nisn't just plain language to the contrary, and et\ncetera. There is language in the cases to that effect.\nSo I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there\nis no loophole no matter how tiny? That's news to me.\nMR. KATZ: Well, Justice Breyer, I don't\nthink manifest disregard -- certainly, manifest\ndisregard is not a standard by which this matter has\ncome up before the Court. And this Court has held in\nHall Street and other cases that 10(a)(4) is the\nexclusive ground set forth by Congress, that this Court\ndid not have the authority -- and I'm quoting the\nCourt -- it \"did not have the authority to expand.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I\nthink, since I wrote the words in First Options, that\nsomething like manifest disregard or totally ignoring\nplain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even\nan arbitrator. Now, suppose I think that. Then do I\ndecide against you?\nMR. KATZ: No, Justice Breyer, because here\nboth sides, not only in 2003, but in 2010 after\nStolt-Nielsen, came to the arbitrator and said, we want\nyou to decide it. They told the arbitrator at that\ntime, look at the agreement, look at what transpired in\n2002, back when this matter was in the superior court\nand make your decision.\nSo the arbitrator applied the law that -\nand applied the -- the standard that he was told to\napply. He didn't just disregard it. He didn't make a\ndecision saying, I don't care what you are telling me to\ndo.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What supports his decision?\nI mean, you -- you say that. What -- what supports his\ndecision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's\nthe standard. Did they agree to class arbitration?\nWhat -- what supports that?\nMR. KATZ: Justice Scalia, they did agree.\nWhen we were in court in 2002, Oxford represented to the\nState court judge there that not only are the disputes\ngoing to arbitration, but all actions regarding the\ndispute.\nAnd the judge specifically relied upon that,\nexpressly relied upon that, in not sending just the\ndisputes, but sending everything that had been asserted\nby Dr. Sutter, including the claims of the class. And\nthe arbitrator -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. There\nis a distinction between all disputes and all actions\nrelating to the dispute?\nMR. KATZ: Oxford made that distinction in\n2002. In fact -- and we point this out in our brief on\npage 5, the red brief, where Oxford has expressly -\nit's both on page 5 and page 6 and I will refer to page\n6, the top of 6. This is Oxford's counsel in 2002.\n\"The contract\" -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The top of page 6?\nMR. KATZ: The top of page 6, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. KATZ: Plaintiff quoted the contract\nhere as saying \"that any dispute under the contract\nneeds to be arbitrated.\" That's wrong, the contract\nsays \"actions concerning any dispute.\" That is what\nOxford has always argued at all times before the\narbitrator. The arbitrator understood that.\nThe arbitrator interpreted the agreement.\nIt's based both on the agreement and on the\nrepresentations made by Oxford as to what its own\nagreement meant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's\ninconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually\nin fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his\ninitial decision, which is that if you have something\nthat just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of\nclass arbitration at all, that you can't have class\narbitration.\nMR. KATZ: The arbitrator, however,\nMr. Chief Justice, cannot be faulted or -- or his award\nvacated based upon changes or arguments that were never\nmade at the time. The parties made their arguments to\nthe arbitrator. Oxford, if you will, sat on the\nsidelines.\nAnd this Court has also held that a party cannot\nsit on the sidelines, wait till the award comes down,\nand when it's against them then raise new arguments for\nthe first time. Oxford -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you get\nback -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\nMR. KATZ: I'm sorry. I was just going to\nfinish saying, Oxford could have raised these arguments\nand maybe at the end of the day, if they raised these\narguments, they would have carried the day.\nBut I respectfully submit, as this Court\nrepeatedly held, that courts do not have the authority\nto second-guess the arbitrator and make decisions or\ncome up with a resolution that would have been different\nwith the arbitrator just because they disagree.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Getting back to\nJustice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First\nOptions is fairly strong authority for him because there\nyou have a situation with the arbitrator determining\nthat a particular entity or individual is bound by the\nagreement. And we said that's something that we will\nreview de novo, without deference. Why isn't it the\nsame here?\nIn other words, not everything an arbitrator\nsays is subject to the deferential standard of review,\neven if he purports to say I'm interpreting the\nagreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options\ndid?\nMR. KATZ: Here, Mr. Chief Justice, the\narbitrator did exactly what the parties had asked him to\ndo, though. He did not venture and do something outside\nof what the parties had asked him.\nThe parties specifically presented the\nquestion to the arbitrator as to whether class\narbitrations were available and specifically directed\nthe arbitrator both to the agreement -- the language in\nthe agreement, as well as the representations and the\nsubmissions that were made below in the court system in\nmaking their respective arguments.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I see -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that Oxford\nconceded that it did not preserve any question of\nentitlement to de novo review.\nMR. KATZ: That is correct. Oxford has\nalways maintained that it was the arbitrator's decision\nto make, and in 2010, even after Stolt-Nielsen, came\nback to the arbitrator and asked the arbitrator to\nreconsider his opinion from 2003. The -- Oxford had\nnever, until after losing this case obviously, has\nOxford sought the Court for the first time for a de novo\ninterpretation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- counsel, you\nseem -- I don't know. I see two questions here. The\nfirst was an arbitrator exceeds his power if he decides\na question is arbitral when it's not. And -- but here\nthere is no dispute about that because you are right,\nyour adversary submitted this question to arbitration.\nAnd that's what I'm hearing you respond. He did,\nthere's no question, he said the arbitrator has to\ndecide this issue.\nJustice Breyer raised the second question.\nAssuming he could, is there any remaining power in the\nCourt to overturn his decision? And Justice Breyer\nsaid, if the standard is manifest disregard of fact and\nlaw, why would you still win?\nBecause your adversary is saying, the law is\nclear. You have to find some hook in the agreement to\nagree to class action -- arbitration, and he says there\nis none. That's basically his position, that the\narbitrator's decision on its substance manifestly\ndisregarded the law. So that's the question that I\nbelieve is extant still.\nMR. KATZ: Answering that -- answering that\nhypothetical, assuming that was -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was it a hypothetical?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATZ: Well, if there was a manifest\ndisregard -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I want to say why\nthere wasn't. I want you to explain why there wasn't\none.\nMR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrator did not\nmanifestly disregard. The arbitrator did what the\nparties wanted the arbitrator to do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, I'm going to say\nsomething and you are going to say, that's right, that's\njust what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you\ndon't think of it. The arbitrator in front of me, so\nyou better tell me why I'm wrong because they certainly\nwill and they are in the briefs.\nMr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language\nhere says all disputes will go to arbitration. It\ndoesn't say they are supposed to be class or can be or\ncan't be. You decide what it means.\nAnd the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it\ndoesn't say, but I got to reach a decision. So what\nkind of a case is it? Small claims. And then it says\nsomething about court suits where they have class. Hmm,\ngets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says,\nthat's what it means. It means it could include class,\ntoo. Okay?\nWhere in our case law is that a manifest\ndisregard? He's looked at the language, there were two\nplausible constructions, he came up with one of them.\nWhat's the problem? Now, that's of course their\nproblem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why\nthey are saying no it's not going to help me.\nMR. KATZ: Well, I don't believe that is --\nJustice Breyer, I don't believe that is a manifest\ndisregard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- obviously you don't.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATZ: And the reason being is that the\narbitrator based his determination on the standards or\nthe materials that were put forth before him, the\nagreement and the evidence, and he made a decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not enough. As\nstated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a\nplausible construction. It's not enough that he said,\nI'm construing the contract. I have looked at the terms\nof the contract and what the parties' said, and my\nconstruction of the contract is X. That's not enough.\nIt has to be plausible.\nMR. KATZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why is this plausible?\nMR. KATZ: Well, with all due respect,\nJustice Scalia, I don't think plausibility comes into\nplay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Use whatever word you want.\nManifest disregard, stick to the law. Now, suppose the\narbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it.\nI see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball. Now,\nwe would strike that down because that is not relevant.\nBut he didn't say magic 8-ball. He said class. And\nthere are many class arbitrations. So it isn't quite\nmagic 8-ball.\nNow, you explain to me -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's a magic 8-ball? I\ndon't know what you are talking about.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: A magic 8-ball is you\nhave -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a\nnon-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't you, Mr. Katz,\nwhy don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself\nsaid. Mr. Waxman said this clause wasn't unusual, but\nthe arbitrator said, I've never seen anything like this.\nMR. KATZ: Justice Ginsburg, what the\narbitrator had found was that the \"no civil action\" part\nof the clause was -- was coextensive. It was completely\ninterrelated with the mandatory arbitration provision.\nIn other words, what the arbitrator found was that\neverything that was prohibited from being filed in a\nlitigation in the court had to be arbitrated, and that\nwas based on not only -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question on\nsomething a little bit different? Did the arbitrator\nhave -- how many parties were there to this agreement?\nThere is Oxford on one side and how many doctors on the\nother side?\nMR. KATZ: Well, this specific agreement was\nDr. Sutter and Oxford, but there are 20,000 physicians\nwho had signed the same agreement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right, so 20,000. And\nthe effect of the arbitrator's decision is that all of\nthose 20,000 doctors are deemed to have agreed to class\narbitration, right?\nMR. KATZ: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if we assume -- if I ask\nyou to assume, for the sake of argument, that this\nagreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in\nclass arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the\nauthority to make that holding with respect to all of\nthese absent class members?\nMR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrate -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they didn't agree to\nclass arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree\nto have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement\ncalls for -- for class arbitration. How did he purport\nto bind them to that decision?\nMR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrator made the\ndecision based on the language and the evidence\npresented before him and finding that it authorized\nclass arbitration. That was the determination that was\nmade initially.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the -- is the contract\nauthorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are\nsimilarly situated, they got the same contracts?\nMR. KATZ: They all -- they all had the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So either the contract\nmeans what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't.\nIf it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then\neverybody's bound.\nMR. KATZ: That -- that is correct. Now,\nultimately, when the matter was certified -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wait a minute. Where did he\nget the authority to make that decision to interpret the\ncontract with respect to them?\nMR. KATZ: Well, the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You're saying he can do it\nwith respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the\narbitrator decide whether this calls for class\narbitration. But these other people didn't. They\ndidn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it\ncalls for class arbitration.\nMR. KATZ: Well, Justice Alito, this -- this\nis no different than in any other contract\ninterpretation issue. The arbitrator makes a\ndetermination based upon the reading of the language and\nwhat the parties are telling him that language means.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the difference\nis in First Options. The one thing First Options says\nis the question of who's going to be bound by\narbitration is decided by the court de novo. And in the\nclass context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who\ndid not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular\ninterpretation.\nMR. KATZ: But Stolt-Nielsen, which the\narbitrator faithfully reviewed, analyzed, and followed,\nmakes clear that you can have class arbitration as long\nas the arbitrator determines that the contracting\nparties to that agreement establish that class\narbitration is available.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did these other people\nagree to this arbitrator? I mean, they might have said,\nthis arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say\nthat -- that we agreed to class action. We didn't agree\nto class -- I don't want this arbitrator.\nThey didn't agree to this arbitrator. Why\nshould they be bound by -- by whatever he says?\nMR. KATZ: Well, for one thing,\nJustice Scalia, that's exactly what Oxford wanted.\nOxford argued that the class action should go into\narbitration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they -- could they\nopt out?\nMR. KATZ: Well, ultimately, they could -\nthey could opt out when it was certified. And I want\nto -- I'd like to be clear on a point, if I may.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can they opt out if\nthey've agreed to class arbitration?\nMR. KATZ: Well, they can opt out of the\nclass and pursue, if they wanted to at that point, an\nindividual arbitration if that's what they chose to do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure? It seems to\nme if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've\nagreed to class arbitration.\nMR. KATZ: Well, they -- they proceeded -\nthey agreed for the matter to proceed as a class\nproceeding. But the matters -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And those -- and there\nare rules that governed that, right?\nMR. KATZ: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. That is before we get to the issue of whether\nthe class itself be certified.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but how could -\nhow could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says,\nas Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we\nhave -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case. I\ndecide that there is a class action, all these people\nare in the class.\nMR. KATZ: Justice Kennedy, the\ndetermination that this matter could proceed as a class\narbitration was only the first issue that was decided.\nWe then engaged in the procedural mechanism by which the\nmatter could be certified and that they could -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, presumably they could\nopt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless\nthey opted out? That's not the usual way people are\nbound by litigations.\nMR. KATZ: But everyone, Justice Alito,\neveryone signs the same agreement. And therefore, if\nthe arbitrator's going to make a determination here -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but I think you're -\nyou're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that\nthis is an incorrect interpretation of the contract.\nThat's the assumption. This is incorrect. If we were\nreviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the\ninterpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we\nwould say, this is wrong. This is really wrong. Okay?\nAssume that to be the case.\nThen how are they -- how are these absent\npeople bound? And it's really not an answer to say,\nwell, they can opt out. If they didn't agree to be\nbound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't\nagree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an\nunusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would never have\nclass action arbitration if that were so.\nMR. KATZ: If -- if it was -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be impossible\nbecause you could never get in advance -- they find out\nthat by getting notice and then they decide whether they\nwant to stay with it or opt out.\nMR. KATZ: Well, in any class arbitration,\nthe arbitrator is not going to decide the same questions\nas to the 20,000 of the same agreements. It's decided\nbased upon the class representative who brings the\nmatter.\nAnd even if the arbitrator was wrong,\nJustice Alito, I submit that under 10(a)(4) in the\napplicable standard, that even in Concepcion, this Court\nsaid 10(a)(4) is -- is not an issue of mistake, it's an\nissue of misconduct. And that's not what we have here.\nIf there was a mistake, that still would not be enough\nwith respect to the courts to have vacated the\narbitrator's determination on this matter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this may not -\nI'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be. I\nthought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these\nthings quickly. This has been going on 11 years, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATZ: This has been going on 11 years.\nThat is true. It's been going on -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- it's not\na facetious question because I think one of the concerns\nabout class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the\nsupposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have\nsort of quick and rough and ready determinations when\nit's going to bind 20,000 people.\nMR. KATZ: Well, class arbitration is, as in\nmany arbitrations in this day and age, involves complex\nissues, that sometimes you have major corporations doing\nbattle over -- over major agreements that they know at\nthe time involved big ticket items.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask -- ask\nyou this question because I think it's consistent with\nthe answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little\nbit different, though. Suppose you have -- and this is\na hypothetical case, this is not this case because I\ndon't know the facts. Suppose you have an attorney in a\nsmall town, well respected, doesn't have a great big\npractice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator.\nAnd if he arbitrates the one case, he's\ngoing to get a fee of, I don't know, $10,000. He\nsays -- you know, if this is a class arbitration, I can\nkeep this going for 11 years, I will make a million\ndollars.\nDoes he have the obligation to say, I'm\ngoing to decide the class action issue under this theory\nthat is decided here, and after I do that, since I have\na conflict, I'll bow out. I'll just say, there is a\nclass action, and then I will leave it for some other\narbitrator. Does he have that obligation? And if he\ndoesn't, should that bear on our decision here?\nMR. KATZ: Justice Kennedy, that should not\nbear on the decision here because this matter comes up\nunder 10(a)(4). If there were questions about the\npartiality of the arbitrator, then I want to rule in\nfavor of Katz because I want to prolong this thing as\nlong as possible, then perhaps Oxford should have\nbrought the matter under 10(a)(2) and -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How long -- can we\nstraighten out this 11 years? How many years was this\nin the New Jersey court before there was ever an\narbitrator appointed?\nMR. KATZ: Well, the matter wasn't in the\nNew Jersey courts for that long, but various points in\ntime because the AAA rules allow for a -- a filing of\na Federal suit to vacate Oxford, on multiple\noccasions -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but tell me why -\nwhy is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our\ndecision? That should not be a factor in our decision?\nMR. KATZ: Partiality is not a factor,\nJustice Kennedy -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but surely -\nMR. KATZ: -- in this decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Finish\nyour answer.\nMR. KATZ: In this decision, because\npartiality or what could potentially be perceived as a\nsubjective intent, so the arbitrator does not play under\n10(a)(4).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under -\nunder -- that provision, the partiality provision, is\naddressed to favoring one party as opposed to another\nparty.\nI think Justice Kennedy's question goes to\nan institutional concern about an arbitrator making a\ndecision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to\npartiality between parties, but a problem about the way\nthe system would work, that would create an incentive\nfor an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a\nruling that expands his authority.\nMR. KATZ: Well, arbitrators -- I would\nsubmit that an arbitrator who was doing something that\nwas -- that was documented or perceived to be crazy -\nand pardon my vernacular -- or just way out of line,\nthen I'd submit that arbitrator is not going to be hired\nagain.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how -- what\nis the history of class actions and arbitrations? There\nare at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of\nrules about how you handle class arbitrations, right?\nMR. KATZ: That's correct. I think it's\nimportant -- if I could just address a couple of points\nregarding that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many have there been?\nHave there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?\nMR. KATZ: Well, I don't know -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any idea?\nMR. KATZ: Well -- I don't think there has\nbeen thousands, but there -- I know there have certainly\nbeen a number so far that the American Arbitration\nAssociation has set forth rules -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure there's been a\nnumber. What's the number?\nMR. KATZ: I -- I don't -- I don't know the\nnumber.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could be less than 100?\nMR. KATZ: I wouldn't know that,\nJustice Scalia.\nBut -- if I may point this out, class\narbitrations were certainly in existence at the time\nthat this matter was sent into class arbitration. And\nin fact, I think it's also worthy to understand that\nwhen I brought this matter in superior court, I argued\nthat the class action should be kept in court, but it\nwas Oxford's argument that everything including the\nclass action go into arbitration.\nIt was Oxford's interpretation of its own\nclause that the arbitrator relied upon, which puts this\ncase completely outside of Stolt-Nielsen, where in\nStolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator fashioned his -- their own\nrules based on some policy preference about arbitrations\n-- about class actions which wasn't present here.\nAnd if I could address an issue that was\nraised about -- that the arbitrator discussed something\nthat was bizarre. In 2003, that was a pre- -- so that\nwas prior to Stolt-Nielsen -- the arbitrator expressly\ndisavowed that in his 2010 opinion. And he made it very\nclear that he based his decisions on the interpretation\nof the agreement as well as the representations made as\nto what that agreement meant to the court system.\nI think this Court has recognized for 2\ncenturies that an arbitrator's error in law or fact\ncannot be the grounds for a vacatur.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to just\ninterrupt. For most of that two centuries, courts\nrefused to enforce arbitration agreements. That's the\nwhole reason we have the FAA.\nMR. KATZ: But here, both sides, Mr. Chief\nJustice, expressly asked the arbitrator. This is not a\nquestion of arbitrability because both sides wanted the\narbitrator to make that decision. Then even after 2010,\nwhen it came to light that Bazzle -- there was a\nplurality and the issue of whether it's a question of\narbitrability is an open question, Oxford didn't go\nrunning to court then.\nInstead, it went back to the arbitrator and\nsaid, we want you to reconsider your 2003 decision. And\nthe arbitrator again went through the analysis of\ninterpreting the agreement and the representations made\nby the parties about what that agreement meant.\nI submit we have to -- if we trust\narbitrators to handle such important issues as civil\nrights issues and other very important matters of\nsingular importance, we have to expect that they will\nfollow the precepts of this Court and the FAA as to what\nconstitutes grounds for class arbitration.\nI think the Third Circuit should be\naffirmed, if there are no other questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Katz.\nMr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nI have three points, two small ones and one\nsignificant one.\nThe first small one is that this notion,\nthis canard, that we told the district -- the State\ncourt judge that class actions should be sent to\narbitration is dispensed with on pages 13 and 14 of our\nreply brief, following the sentence, \"Tellingly, Sutter\nresorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous\npositions.\"\nAnd I refer the Court again specifically to\nfootnote 7 on page 14, where we quote my brother's\nstatements to the State court judge explaining that what\nwe were asking for was, quote, \"a motion to compel\nindividual arbitration.\"\nThe second small point goes to the issue of\nwhat the number is of class arbitrations. I also don't\nknow that. But we know that as of this Court's decision\nin Stolt-Nielsen because this was reported in the AAA\namicus brief, that not a single final decision had been\nrendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in\nany class arbitration.\nThe AAA class arbitration rules were adopted\nafter this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open\nthe possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in\nthis case said was surprising because the arbitrator\nsaid quite correctly that everyone expected that in\nBazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as\nclass arbitration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your significant\npoint?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: I can't go back 200 years, but\nlet's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard. And in\nthe Steelworkers v. the Enterprise Wheel case, what this\nCourt held was, quote, \"An award is legitimate only so\nlong as it draws its essence from the agreement. When\nthe arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this\nobligation, courts have no choice but to refuse\nenforcement of the award.\"\nAnd our submission is that this award, the\nconclusion that the all-disputes provision here\nmanifested an actual agreement by the parties to class\narbitration, cannot possibly be reconciled with the\nplain language or Stolt-Nielsen's holding.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Waxman. Counsel.\n"
