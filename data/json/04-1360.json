        "content": "[10:02 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nin Hudson versus Michigan.\nMr. Moran.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOver the last 50 years, courts in virtually\nevery American jurisdiction have suppressed evidence\nseized inside homes following knock-and-announce\nviolations -- including this Court, on two occasions.\nThose suppression orders reflect an understanding of\ntwo points key to this appeal. The first point is\nthat the manner of entry -- and, in particular, a\nknock-and-announce violation -- is not somehow\nindependent of the police activity that occurs inside\nthe house. And, as this Court directly recognized in\nWilson, the reasonableness of police activity inside\na home is dependent on the manner of the police\nentry.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask you whether\nthere are statutes in various States that allow an\nofficer to get a no-knock warrant?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, there are, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And does Michigan have\nsuch a statute?\nMR. MORAN: I do not believe so, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How common are those\nstatutes?\nMR. MORAN: I believe about half the States\nhave such no-knock -- no-knock statutes. So, in\nMichigan, a police officer -- if the -- if the\ncircumstances on the scene justify a no-knock entry,\nthen the officer is permitted, by case law and, of\ncourse, by the precedents of this Court, to go ahead\nand do so.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why would an officer,\nwithout such permission, want to make a no-knock\nentry while possessing a warrant --\nMR. MORAN: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- a search warrant?\nMR. MORAN: -- as this case illustrates,\nsometimes officers believe that it is to their\nadvantage to perform a no-knock entry, or to fail to\ncomply with the knock-and-announce requirement. And\nthat is why --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why?\nMR. MORAN: Well, Officer Good apparently\nthought that his safety would be better served he if\ndisregarded the knock-and-announce requirement; and\nso, he candidly testified, at the evidentiary\nhearing, that it's essentially his policy, in drug\ncases, to go in without a -- without performing the\nnecessary knock-and-announce. And that was 1 year\nafter the -- this Court's decision in Richards,\nsaying that there is no per-se exclusion of drug\ncases from the knock-and-announce requirement.\nBut that brings me to the second reason why\ncourts have almost universally, until the Stevens\ncase in 1999, held that suppression of evidence is\nnecessary, and that is deterrence; because, without\nthe suppression of evidence, there is very little\nchance that the officers will be deterred from\nroutinely violating the knock-and-announce\nrequirement, from adopting a sort of personal\nviolation of the requirement, just as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know, I'd be\nworried -- you know, bust in somebody's door -- that\nthe homeowner wouldn't shoot me. Without announcing\nthat I'm the police, he had every reason to believe\nhe's under attack. Isn't that a considerable\ndeterrent?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, that's the one purpose of\nthe knock-and-announce requirement that doesn't\nprotect the homeowner's interest, that protects the\nofficer's interest --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMR. MORAN: -- against being shot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MORAN: However, what we'll see then,\nif there is no exclusion of evidence following knock-\nand-announce rules, are entries precisely like the\none we have here, where the officers will, in fact,\nannounce -- they yell, \"Police, search warrant\" --\nbut then they'll immediately go in. Officer Good\nsaid that he went in real fast. He went in, and it\ntook him just a few seconds to get in the door. So,\nthat's what they'll do. They'll announce -- some\nofficers will announce, because they'll want the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: -- people inside to know that\nthey're police, but they will not wait for a refusal,\nand they certainly will not wait for a reasonable\namount of time for some --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I agree with\na point that you make in your brief that civil\nactions simply are of no use. That might have been\nthe case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule,\nbut our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by\nprisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of\nthese cases are successful below. What reason is\nthere to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate\ndeterrent?\nMR. MORAN: Simply, Justice Scalia, that,\nas far as we can determine, no one wins a knock-and-\nannounce case, or we haven't been able to find a\nsingle case in which someone has actually recovered\ndamages for a knock-and-announce violation. So, if\nthis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the\ndamages are slight or because there's a defense that\nis successful? What has been the defense in these\ntort cases?\nMR. MORAN: Both, Justice Ginsburg. First\nof all, in many cases, such as this one, where the\npolice don't actually destroy the door, it would be\nvery hard to quantify the damages, and it would be\nvery hard to find a lawyer to take a case such as\nthis. But the second barrier is the various\nimmunities, tort immunities. In section 1983\nactions, there are qualified immunities that make it\ndifficult to win a suit. And because it is not a\nbright line as to when the police officers have to\nknock and announce, and when they do not -- that is,\nIs there a reasonable suspicion that a quick entry or\na no-knock entry will be met with violence or that\nthe evidence will be destroyed? -- courts tend to be\nvery generous in granting qualified immunity to\nofficers -- that is, concluding that some reasonable\nofficers might have concluded that it was justified\nto dispense with the knock-and-announcement\nrequirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that same\nproblem exists if the consequence is exclusion of\nevidence. Courts are going to view it the same way.\nYou're not going to avoid that problem by excluding\nevidence.\nMR. MORAN: Well, there -- but there is not\na qualified-immunity defense to the exclusionary\nrule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. MORAN: And so, if the Court concluded\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, your point\nis, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long\nenough, right? And that's why they don't win a lot\nof these cases. But the same thing is going to be\ntrue if the consequence of not waiting long enough is\nthe exclusion of the evidence. The court is going to\nbe very -- it's going to be very difficult to tell if\nthey waited long enough, and, as you say, the court\nis likely to say, you know, \"Let it go.\"\nMR. MORAN: That's true, to some extent,\nJustice Scalia, but, as an empirical matter, I've\ncited many cases, in my brief, over the last 50 years\nwhere courts from a vast majority of American\njurisdictions have found knock-and-announce\nviolations in criminal cases, and have, therefore,\nexcluded the evidence, including this Court, on two\noccasions, 1958 and 1968. So, courts do find knock-\nand-announce violations in criminal cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Our two cases did not --\ndid not raise that issue. The issue was not decided\nin those cases, was it?\nMR. MORAN: The issue of a knock-and-\nannounce violation leading to exclusion of evidence--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MORAN: -- was decided. The -- there\nwas not an inevitable-discovery issue raised in those\ntwo cases, because those cases predated the\ninevitable-discovery doctrine. But, of course, in\n1958 and 1968, this Court was very familiar with the\nindependent-source doctrine. And, really, the\nargument that the Michigan Supreme Court has adopted\n-- they call it an inevitable-discovery argument;\nit's really an independent-source doctrine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you\ndon't dispute the application of the inevitable-\ndiscovery principle here, do you?\nMR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice -- Mr.\nChief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. MORAN: No, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you don't\ndispute that the purpose of the knock-and-announce\nrule is not to allow the targets of the search to\ndispose of evidence, or anything of that sort.\nMR. MORAN: Absolutely not. The purpose of\nthe knock-and-announce rule is to protect the\nhomeowner's privacy rights. It's one of the core\nparts of the right of the people to be secure in\ntheir homes against unreasonable police invasions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a\nlimited privacy right, of course. These people have\na warrant, right?\nMR. MORAN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how would you\ndescribe the privacy interest that the knock-and-\nannounce rule is protecting?\nMR. MORAN: Well, I think this Court has\ndescribed it well in the -- in its most recent cases\n-- in Banks and Richards, in particular, as well as\nRamirez and Wilson -- that it is a right against\nbeing terrified by having the police come in. It is\na right against being embarrassed. People might be\nin all stages of undress or in compromising positions\nwhen the police come in. And it is a right against\nhaving one's door destroyed. The English cases, the\nearly English cases, first recognized that it's a\nright against having one's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it doesn't go\nat all to the items that are the target of the\nwarrant.\nMR. MORAN: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, why should\nthe remedy for the violation be to exclude those\nitems? The privacy that's protected isn't the\ncocaine, the weapons, the other items that were\ndiscovered.\nMR. MORAN: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I think you could say the same thing about\nthe warrant requirement. The purpose of the warrant\nrequirement is also to protect the sanctity and the\nprivacy of the home; it's not to protect contraband\nthat one might have in the home, or whatever it is\nthat the police are looking for. It's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's to protect\nprivacy in the possessions and papers and effects.\nAnd these are possessions, papers, and effects. It\ngoes right to what the police are trying to seize,\nand you have an independent magistrate make a\ndetermination that there's probable cause to believe\nit, et cetera, et cetera. The knock-and-announce\nrule is an entirely -- concerned with entirely\ndifferent things. And yet, you're enforcing it by\nexcluding the papers, effects, and possessions.\nMR. MORAN: And I think the courts have\nrecognized that it's necessary to enforce it that\nway, because other methods of enforcing it will not\nwork. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but just --\nMR. MORAN: -- I think it's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just on the point of\nthe causal relation that the Chief Justice was\nexploring, I mean, there is a causal relation in a\nbut-for sense. We know that.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose the position of\nthe Respondent is that the minute there's an entry\nafter the knock violation -- the no-knock violation -\n- the minute there's an entry, that injury ceases, so\nthat it's different from a warrantless rummaging-\naround through drawers and so forth. I suppose that\nwould be their argument.\nMR. MORAN: I think that is their argument,\nJustice Kennedy, and I respectfully disagree with it.\nAs a historical matter, even the early English cases\nrecognized that when an officer illegally entered --\na sheriff illegally entered a home with a valid writ,\nthat officer became a trespasser, and the activity\nthat he performed in the home was, therefore,\nillegal. In the reply brief, I cited several early\nAmerican cases, from the 1830s and 1840s, holding\nthat when an officer had a valid writ to seize a\ndebtor's goods, but illegally entered the home, then\nthat writ became no good; and, therefore, the officer\n-- the sheriff, in those cases -- could be sued, not\nonly for the illegal entry, but also for the seizure\nof the goods that he had a valid warrant, or a valid\nwrit, to seize, and that that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but here it was a\nwarrant to enter the home, not to seize particular\ngoods. So, the entry of the home was not illegal.\nThe entering of the home was perfectly okay. What\nwas illegal was not knocking and announcing in\nadvance. It seems to me that's quite a different --\nquite a different issue, and the causality is quite\ndifferent.\nMR. MORAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nrespectfully disagree that the entry was not illegal.\nI believe the entry was illegal, because what a\nwarrant authorizes an -- a -- an officer to do is to\nmake a legal entry. It does not allow the officer to\nenter however he pleases; it allows the officer to\nmake an entry that complies with the law -- in\nparticular, the fourth amendment. And so, the entry\nwas illegal. They could have performed a legal\nentry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but the\nessence of the violation was not the entering;\nwhereas, in the cases, the old common law cases\nyou're talking about, the essence of the violation\nwas the entering. Here, the entering was perfectly\nokay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give\nthe advance notice, that made it bad. And that, it\nseems to me, creates a different situation.\nMR. MORAN: I think, starting in Semayne's\ncase, the Court recognized that even if the officer\nwould have a right to knock down the door after a\nrefusal of entry was obtained, that if the officer\ndid not wait for that refusal, then the entry was\nillegal. And so, I think the common law cases do\nsupport -- the old English common law cases, starting\nwith Semayne's case -- do support the notion that the\nentry -- the entry does become illegal if the officer\ndoes not wait for the refusal. And in this case, of\ncourse, the officer did not wait at all for any\nrefusal, candidly admitted that he went in as soon as\nhe could get through the door, as quickly as he\ncould.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Moran, would you\nclarify an answer you gave to Justice O'Connor at the\noutset of the argument? You said there is no\nstatutory right to get a no-knock warrant. But did\nyou say, as a matter of case law and practice, that\ncan be done in Michigan?\nMR. MORAN: I don't believe so. I don't\nbelieve that Michigan still allows for no-knock\nwarrants. But officers, of course, can perform no-\nknock entries when arriving at the scene, the\ncircumstances justify a no-knock entry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean, if you\nhad a case where the reason you were arresting the\nguy is because he's shot through the door the last\nthree times somebody knocked and announced, you still\nhave to knock and announce, under Michigan law?\nMR. MORAN: No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I think, in that case, that would satisfy\nthe Richards standard. In that case, the officer\nwould have particularized suspicions amounting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he couldn't get\na warrant saying that.\nMR. MORAN: I don't believe Michigan has a\nprocedure for granting no-knock warrants, not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's -- that's\nactually what's disturbing me about this, because I\nthought the knock-and-announce rule was a rule that\nwould allow a policeman to go in without knocking and\nannouncing when he has reasonable grounds for\nthinking he might get shot if he didn't. So, I -- as\nI read the briefs, I thought maybe that's not how\nit's being implemented, that the policemen are\nsupposed to run the risk of being shot. I didn't\nthink that was the situation. So, I'd appreciate\nyour explaining that to me.\nMR. MORAN: Well, in Richards, this Court\nsaid that if there are particular facts about this\nparticular entry that would make an officer have\nreasonable suspicions that he is going to be shot at\nor the evidence is going to be destroyed, then the\nofficer may dispense with the knock-and-announce\nrequirement. There were no such suspicions in this\ncase, and that's why the prosecution conceded, at the\noutset and at every step since, that it was a knock-\nand-announce violation. The officers had no\ninformation about this particular --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would it be sufficient if\nthe officer says, \"One, this is a drug gang; two,\nthey don't let people into the house whom they don't\nknow; and, three, they have guns\"?\nMR. MORAN: That might be sufficient, after\nRichards, but that's not the facts of this case. We\nhave none of those facts in this case. They were\nserving a warrant, and they had no information that\nthey were going to be in particular danger. They had\nno information, for example, that there were drugs,\nstored near the toilet, that were going to be flushed\ndown.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I\nunderstand the hypothetical case, where, three times\nbefore, there had been warrants served, and, each\ntime, the homeowner shot at the officer, the fourth\ntime, they could go in without waiting.\nMR. MORAN: I think that would be an easy\ncase, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think it would, okay.\nMR. MORAN: Because then you would have\nparticular facts about this particular residence and\nthe people involved. I think that would be a very\neasy case for a no-knock entry. We --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can't get a\nwarrant that says he can do that.\nMR. MORAN: I don't believe Michigan has\nthat procedure. Perhaps Mr. Baughman can correct me.\nHe's a -- he's with the prosecuting attorney's\noffice. But I don't believe Michigan has that\nprocedure. Not all States do have that procedure.\nAnd, instead, States that don't have that procedure\nsimply leave it to the officer to determine if there\nare those facts that justify a no-knock entry. So,\nthere are many entries in Michigan, that occur all\nthe time, that do not comply with the knock-and-\nannounce requirement. And that's fine, because the\nofficer does, in fact, have the particularized facts\njustifying a no-knock entry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We've been down this\nroute before in other cases, like Wilson, but it's\nstill a troublesome measure. It's hard for me to\nbelieve that if a person has drugs in the pockets of\nhis trousers or on the -- next to the chair where\nhe's sitting, that he wouldn't immediately run and\ntry to dispose them. I just think that it's ordinary\nbehavior. And, if that's so, then it would follow\nthat you never have to knock if you're looking for\ndrugs that might be on the person. Do you have any\ncomment as to that?\nMR. MORAN: Well, then that would -- this\nCourt, I think, would have to reverse Richards,\nbecause Richards said that the fact that it's a\nfelony drug investigation does not justify a blanket\nexclusion from the knock-and-announce requirement.\nAnd this Court unanimously held, in Richards, that\nthe knock-and-announce requirement applies in felony\ndrug cases --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --\nMR. MORAN: -- unless --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if we say that a\nlikelihood -- or that the -- or substantial\nprobability that the evidence will be destroyed\nallows the no-knock, why won't that be true in every\ndrug case, other than for what we said in Richards?\nMR. MORAN: Well, because in Richards --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, do people say,\n\"Oh, they've got me now. I won't get rid of the\ndrugs\"?\nMR. MORAN: Well, first of all, Justice\nKennedy, I think the law presumes that homeowners\nwill either make an explicit refusal, \"No,\" or will\nanswer the door; and primarily that they'll do the\nlatter. The presumption of the homeowner that we're\ntalking about is an innocent homeowner, somebody who\nis either -- has nothing to do with whatever the\npolice are looking for. There are many cases where\nthe police are looking for goods that are not\nconnected to the people who are home.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when there's\nprobable cause to enter, there's no presumption of\ninnocence, is there, or am I wrong?\nMR. MORAN: Well, it -- with -- probable\ncause is a standard at somewhere around 50 percent,\nand a very large number of warrants are executed on\nthe homes of people who have nothing, or people who -\n- there is something that the police are looking for,\nbut they don't have anything to do with it; they're\nthird-party homeowners. And, for that reason, the\nknock-and-announce requirement recognizes that many,\nmany warrants -- many, many searches -- will be\nexecuted on the homes of perfectly upstanding,\ninnocent people. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- do\nyou have any empirical basis for your statement that\nmany warrants are executed and they don't find\nanything?\nMR. MORAN: Well, I don't have any\nstatistics. I'm sure the FBI keeps statistics on at\nleast Federal warrants. But it's true that in a\nlarge number of warrants, the police don't find what\nthey're looking for, because probable cause is a\nstandard that is not particularly high.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any\nbasis for your statement that, in a large number,\nthey don't find what they're -- anything that they're\nlooking for?\nMR. MORAN: I don't have any empirical\nevidence, but certainly lots and lots of anecdotal\nevidence, from reading newspaper accounts of police -\n-\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you --\nMR. MORAN: -- searches.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you don't dispute the\nfact that presumption of innocence -- the presumption\nof innocence survives an indictment, doesn't it?\nMR. MORAN: It does, and I think it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: -- survives the search warrant.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So probable cause is not\nenough to eliminate the presumption of innocence.\nMR. MORAN: I certainly would argue that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: -- Justice Stevens, that\nprobable cause it not a very high standard. And in -\n- many search warrants are, in fact, served on the\nhomes of people who are not suspected, because\nthey're thought to be the place where stuff was\nstored, but not be the people who are suspected of\ndoing anything wrong in the first place.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Moran, these old\ncommon law cases you referred to, which held that a\nfailure to knock and announce renders the entry\nunlawful, what was the consequence, in those cases?\nMR. MORAN: Those were cases in which,\ntypically, the sheriff was sued for trespassing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And the evidence\nwould -- if found, was not excluded, right?\nMR. MORAN: No. There was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we wanted to be\nfaithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't\nexclude the evidence.\nMR. MORAN: I think things have changed,\nJustice Scalia, since those common law days, for that\nreason.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then you shouldn't\nhave cited the common law case.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. MORAN: Well, Justice Stevens -- I\nmean, excuse me, Justice Scalia, things have changed,\nin the sense, first of all, that in those days there\nwas a common law writ of trespass. If one were to\nfile, in Michigan, a complaint for trespass against\nthe sheriff, one would be laughed out of court today,\nbecause all that you have is a tort suit, which you\nhave to show an extreme violation -- I cited the\nMichigan statute that requires extreme recklessness\non the part of the police officer.\nThe second point is that in those days the\nsheriffs were -- there were adequate means to control\nthe behavior of sheriffs, because they were seen as\narms of the judiciary. That, of course, was before\nthe rise of the independent police forces that we\nhave today. And so, the exclusionary rule, of\ncourse, was adopted in the late 1800s, early 1900s --\nin part, in response to the changing circumstances of\nthe police. The police were no longer under the\ndirect control of the judiciary; and so, different\nremedies were necessary in order to assure compliance\nwith constitutional rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the courts that have\nallowed this action to go forward, has the rationale\nbeen that there is no other effective deterrent to\nignoring or violating the knock-and-announce rule?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. At last\ncount now, 11 State and Federal appellate courts have\ndirectly rejected the Michigan Supreme Court's\nreasoning. The Idaho Court of Appeals just joined\nthe list 2 weeks ago, in a -- in a case that I -- is\nnot cited, because it's so recent. And they have\nuniformly -- I believe all 11 of those cases have\nsaid that, \"Were we to hold otherwise, the knock-and-\nannounce rule would become meaningless,\" a worry that\nthis Court expressed in Richards. This Court was\nvery concerned, in Richards, that simply excluding\ndrug cases from the knock-and-announce rule would\nmake the knock-and-announce rule meaningless. And\nthese courts have noted that statement -- the courts\nthat came out -- this -- the decisions that came out\nafter Richards, and have said, \"If that is\nmeaningless, then it would be especially meaningless\nif we were to exclude the entire knock-and-announce\nrule from the exclusionary rule, that there would be\nvirtually no reason for police officers ever to\ncomply with a knock-and-announce requirement.\nAnd so, I think the deterrence rationale is\na large part of this, and that's what distinguishes\nthis case from the inevitable-discovery cases, which\nthe Michigan Supreme Court relied on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose there are\na lot of other violations of constitutional rights by\nthe police that are very hard to get at, and that\ncannot be remedied. And I suppose we could punish\nthem by excluding all the evidence, as well. We\ndon't do so, simply because there's no causality. We\ninsist upon a causal connection between the two.\nIt's not enough just to say the -- this is the only\nway to stop the police from making the violation.\nMR. MORAN: No, it is not enough, but what\nis critical in this case is that the knock-and-\nannounce violation goes to the manner of entry, and\nthe Court has long recognized that the two predicates\nfor seizure of goods inside a home, or arrest inside\na home, are authority to enter the home, which is not\ncontested here, and a lawful entry. And if either\none of those two predicates is missing, then you have\ngrounds to suppress the evidence; that is, the\nevidence inside the home is in the fruit of the\nunlawful entry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about our opinion in\nRamirez, where the manner of entry was such that\nthere was damage to property?\nMR. MORAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't exclude the\nevidence there, did we?\nMR. MORAN: No. First of all, this Court\ndidn't find that there was a violation in the -- in\nthe damage in property; this Court found no -- did\nnot find, as a matter of law, any fourth amendment\nviolation. But I read the Ramirez -- that language\nfrom Ramirez as saying that as long as the entry\nremains lawful -- and, in Ramirez, the entry was\nlawful, because there were valid grounds to dispense\nwith the knock-and-announce requirement. You had a\nknown dangerous fugitive, who had bragged that he\nwouldn't be taken alive. And so, there was every\nreason for the officers to dispense with the knock-\nand-announce requirement. Therefore, the entry was\nlegal. They had both authority -- that is, the\nwarrant -- and they had a valid entry -- that is, a\nno-knock entry that was justified by reasonable\nsuspicion that the officers would be met with\nviolence if they did knock and announce their\npresence. And so, we -- in Ramirez, we have a lawful\nentry. The language that's quoted from Ramirez\ndirectly says, \"the entry remains lawful,\" or words\nto that effect. And you have a different case if you\nhad --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what had happened?\nHad they broken a window on the way in? Is that --\nMR. MORAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the entry remains\nlawful, despite the fact that the manner of the\nentry, which included the breaking of a window, was\nunlawful. I think what the Court meant was not, as\nyou're portraying it, that, objectively, the entry\nwas lawful. I think they were speaking: as a matter\nof law, despite the fact that the breaking of the\nwindow was wrong, the entry was lawful. Just as your\nopponent is saying here: despite the fact that there\nwas no knock-and-announce, the entry was lawful.\nMR. MORAN: Justice Scalia, I don't see any\nlanguage in Ramirez saying that the breaking of the\nwindow was unlawful. I think the breaking of the\nwindow -- I read the Ramirez opinion as saying the\nbreaking --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But even if it was\nunlawful, it was not unconstitutional.\nMR. MORAN: It wasn't -- certainly wasn't\nunconstitutional. Often, when the police perform a\nvalid no-knock entry, they will damage property.\nTypically, they will destroy the door. And so, the\nbreaking of the window in Ramirez, I don't believe\nwas unlawful. I believe it was perfectly valid way\nfor the officer to perform the entry; that is, to put\nthe gun through the window in the garage area in\norder to prevent -- they believed that the homeowner\nhad guns there and was going to use the -- run to the\nguns in order to repel the entry. And so, I believe\nit was a perfectly lawful entry.\nI think what Ramirez was saying was that\nnot all fourth amendment violations bear fruit. And\nI agree with that. We do not have -- we do not\npropound here a theory of everything, having to do\nwith all fourth amendment violations and the fruit\nthat they propound. We simply say that, with a\nknock-and-announce violation that makes the entry\nunlawful, the evidence found inside the home, and\nonly inside the home, is the fruit of that violation,\nunless there truly is an inevitable-discovery or\nindependent-source argument; that is, something\nindependent of the entry, which can't be done here,\nwhen the police simply barge in and, in a matter of\nseconds, perhaps minutes, find the evidence. So, the\n--\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Moran, is it\nundisputed by you that the client would not have\ndisposed of the drugs if the police had waited a few\nseconds?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, we presume that he would\nhave come to the door. He was just a few feet from\nthe door, in fact. He was right in front of the\ndoor. We presume that he would have come to the\ndoor, answered the door, admitted the police, and the\npolice would -- then would have performed the search.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMoran.\nMR. MORAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Baughman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe metaphor of \"fruit of the poisonous\ntree\" is frequently employed when the exclusionary\nrule is discussed. And that metaphor is apt. It is\napt, because the sanction of exclusion, which is not,\nitself, constitutionally required, is designed to\ndeter, and to deter in a specific way: to deter by\ndepriving the police of the result -- the fruit, the\nproduct, the evidentiary advantage that has been\ngained by their improper conduct. And so --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you agree there is\na knock-and-announce requirement --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- even though there is\na warrant?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do you agree that\nthat was violated here, that there wasn't really a\nknock-and-announce here?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there was a -- an\nannouncement, but a failure to wait. There's not --\nthe announcement principles require --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- not only an --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, is exclusion of\nevidence in these circumstances a deterrent, so that\nthe police would be less likely to do that?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It may be.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: But I believe that, before\nthe question of deterrence is reached, the question\nof causality must be addressed. This Court has\nalways said that causation is a necessary, though not\nalways sufficient, predicate, for a application of\nthe exclusionary rule. The way this Court has put it\nis that it is clear that implementation of the\nexclusionary rule in particular cases begins with the\npremise that the challenged evidence is, in some\nsense, the product of the improper police activity.\nSo, I believe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't it --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- the question --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the product, here? I\nmean, if they had not -- if they had not entered,\nthey would not have gotten their evidence. Their\nentry, because it violated knock-and-announce, was\nunlawful. So, it is a product, isn't it?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think -- I think where I\nwould disagree, Your Honor, is that the entry is\nlawful -- in fact, it's not simply authorized, it's\ncommanded by judicial order. The use of force --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, an entry that\nconformed with knock-and-announce would have been\nlawful. This entry didn't. This entry was\nunreasonable. So, I don't see how your argument fits\nthe facts.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: The way I distinguish it,\nand what I -- where I believe the distinction lies is\nthat what was improper was not the fact of entry;\nwhat was improper was the use of force in entering.\nThe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- knock-and-announce --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I mean, how do you make\nthat distinction? I mean, it's like the -- you know,\nthe Cheshire cat and a -- and the smile; you can't\ndistinguish the two. There was one entry, and that\nentry violated the knock-and-announce rule.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, again, the use of\nforce in making the entry violated the knock-and-\nannounce rule. The entry itself was commanded by the\norder of the court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is that\ndifferent from saying the entry is lawful, its only\nproblem is, it was done without a warrant? I mean,\nyou know, he's --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Because if they're --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- inside the building;\njust, unfortunately, the means wasn't right. No\nwarrant.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The means wasn't right.\nNo knock-and-announce.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: If there is no warrant,\nthere is no judicial command to enter, so the entry\nis completely unjustified. Here, we have not set the\nappropriate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you might have\nprobable cause, but just not have the -- have the\nwarrant. So, what is the difference between having\nprobable cause to enter, but failing to get a\nwarrant, and having a warrant, but failing to knock\nand announce?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Because the fourth amendment\ncommands that the police not enter without judicial\nauthorization. The police don't get to make the\nprobable cause decision in advance. And we wish to\nhave a judge make that decision, so we won't, in\nhindsight, say, \"Had you gone to the judge, the judge\nwould have found probable cause, so we'll ratify what\nyou did after the fact.\" The entry itself -- not\njust the manner of entry -- the entry is invalid,\nunless the judge authorizes it, or unless some\nexception exists.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it your view the entry\nwas lawful or unlawful, in this case?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: The fact of entry was\nlawful.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if they had a bazooka -\n-\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's not the\nquestion. The actually -- actual entry was lawful,\nyes?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: The entry was lawful.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the same would be true\nif what they had was a bazooka, and blew the house\nup.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. The entry would be\nlawful. The manner of entry would be unlawful. And\nthe consequence of that entry would turn on what\nforce was used. As, in this case, they opened the\ndoor and walked in. There was no -- there was no\ninjury to person, there was no injury to property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, basically, your\nargument rests on the fact that we can draw a\ndistinction between entry and manner of entry.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. My principle that I am\nadvocating is that any police error in the execution\nof a search, or in the accomplishment of a search,\nbears fruit only in relation to the purpose, or\npurposes, served by the principle violated. One --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: -- has to ask --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a -- it's a\nstrong argument, on the other side, that if we adopt\nyour position, the officers would have no incentive,\nother than their own judgment about their personal\nsafety, whether to comply with the knock-and-announce\nrule.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That is if one assumes that\nthe civil remedy -- that the 1983 actions has no\nteeth and has no force, and I don't believe that's\ntrue at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the experience\nin Michigan? The Michigan Supreme Court has had this\nrule for some time, that you don't exclude the\nevidence.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many successful 1983\nactions have there been --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I am not -- I am not aware\nof any. On the other hand, like Mr. Moran, I --\nother than anecdotal evidence, I have no statistical\nevidence that the police are violating the knock-and-\nannounce principle since the decision in Stevens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have not even\none case that you can cite where a 1983 remedy was\nresorted to and was successful.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: In Michigan, I don't. There\nare cases cited in our brief where, in fact, there\nare actions -- such actions brought. There are\nseveral recent decisions in the Seventh Circuit, for\nexample, where qualified immunity was denied on a\nknock-and-announce violation in the cases in the\ndistrict court for trial or settlement. And there\nmay be many cases that don't make the reports, what\nactions are brought and settled.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not aware of\nany case --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I am not aware of any case -\n-\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- where anyone has\nrecovered --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: And, again, I think Mr.\nMoran correctly points out, in -- many of these cases\nare resolved by finding that the Richards v.\nWisconsin exceptions have been met. It is not, to\nme, remarkable that there are not a lot of civil\nactions. I believe there are not a lot of\nviolations, because, while no-knock entries may\noccur, they are justified, under Richards v.\nWisconsin, in most cases. This case is an\naberration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the no-knock warrant,\ndo you agree that it's not possible to get one in\nMichigan?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there is no statute in\nMichigan where one can go to the judge in advance and\nsay, \"Here are the facts, known to me already, before\nI even get to the scene, that should justify a no-\nknock.\" That doesn't exist in Michigan. Michigan\nfollows Richards v. Wisconsin, and, in -- had case\nlaw, even in advance of that, which simply said,\n\"Whether known in advance, or whether the facts\noccurred at the time of the execution of the warrant,\nif the Richards exceptions are met, you can go in\nwithout knocking and announcing.\" So, we do follow\nthat rule. You just simply can't get advance\njudicial authorization. It doesn't exist. But it is\ncertainly permissible, and it -- as Mr. Moran\nindicated, it happens on a fairly regular basis,\nbecause, unlike Mr. Moran, I believe the notion that\n-- even in this case, I'm not saying there was no\nviolation; there was a violation, because the police\ndidn't know in advance that the defendant was sitting\nin a chair with the cocaine in his pocket, on the\nchair in front of him, and a gun by his side. I\nthink that he would have answered the door. It's\nhighly speculative, and somewhat fanciful, in that\ncircumstance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they get to make\n-- do they get to make \"inevitable\" arguments on\ntheir side? I mean, let's say, as what happened\nhere, or as seemingly happened, the fellow is found\nnear the chair with the drugs. Can't they argue,\n\"Well, if you had knocked and you had waited 10\nseconds, he would have gotten up from the chair and\ngone somewhere else\"? And you wouldn't have been\nable to argue, at trial, \"He was sitting in the chair\nwith the drugs.\"\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's true, but the drugs\nwere -- in this case, the drugs were in his pocket.\nSo, it wouldn't have helped him.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was something\nin the chair, right? I mean, the --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: There was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the gun, or what\n--\nMR. BAUGHMAN: The gun was in the -- in the\nchair, but he was only convicted for the drugs in his\npocket.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Hmm.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I don't think he -- he could\nsay, \"If you would have -- I would have gotten up and\nanswered the door; and, therefore, you wouldn't have\nhad to come in without knocking, you wouldn't have\nhad to break the door, you wouldn't have had to scare\nme.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't have\nbeen able to tell the jury, \"I was standing next to\nthe chair, because if I had -- I obviously would have\ngotten away from the chair, because I knew that's\nwhere the gun was.\"\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's -- that may well be.\nAnd I want to be clear, I am not here arguing that\nthis Court should decide that there is no\ncircumstance possible where something that occurs in\nthe premises is not causally connected to the failure\nto knock and announce. All I'm asking the Court to\ndecide is that causation is required before the\nexclusionary rule is implemented, and physical\nevidence found within a proper search of -- search of\nproper scope, pursuant to the warrant, that that is\nnot causally connected to the -- to the knock-and-\nannounce violation. There may be other --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you -- so, you think\nit's possible that the defendant could argue that the\nevidence should be excluded because, \"Had he knocked\nand announced, I would have run to the toilet and\nflushed it down, rather than\" --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"answering the\" --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: No, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think the only thing he\ncould --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's causal.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: But I think you have to tie\nthe causal connection to the purposes -- as I have\ntried to indicated -- to the purpose, or purposes,\nserved by the principle violated. What is the\npurpose of knocking and announcing? And I think --\nYour Honor indicated -- it's to protect against\ninjury to the police, injury of people inside, and\nproperty. It has no purpose to protect against the\ninvasion of the privacy of the dwelling and the\ndiscovery of the evidence. In fact, if the police\nknew in advance that the defendant might flush the\ndrugs down the toilet, they wouldn't have to knock\nand announce at all. So, I think we have to relate\nthe causal question to, What is the principle\nviolated? What purposes does it serve? And, in the\ncase of knock-and-announce, it does not serve the\npurpose of allowing evidence to be destroyed. That,\nin fact, serves as an exception to knocking and\nannouncing at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say the\npurpose of knock-and-announce is?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: This Court has identified it\non several occasions as to avoid unnecessary violence\nto the property, avoid unnecessary possible injury to\npeople, both to the officers who are executing the\nwarrant and people inside, and to allow the person\ninside to prepare to answer -- as Mr. Moran\nindicated, if they might be in a state of undress or\nsomething, they could avoid that embarrassment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, I take it your\nargument is that, except in cases in which the people\ninside the house are not dressed, or cases in which\nthere is, in fact, a gun battle of some sort, that a\nknock-and-announce violation will, in fact, never be\nthe cause of any damage at all.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: It will never be the cause\nof the discovery of the physical evidence found --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, it -- no, but\nit'll never be the cause of any compensable damage at\nall.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Well, if a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because I take it your\nargument is: what you can recover from requires\ncausation. And what I mean by \"causation\" is the\ncausation of the harms which the rule is intended to\navoid.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if the only harms that\nthe rule is intended to avoid is the exposure of\nnakedness and violence, once inside, and there are\ncases without nakedness or without violence, then, in\nthose cases, there will never be a recovery.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Oh, in those cases, correct.\nIn cases where there is violence, there will be\nrecovery. In a case such as the instant one, where\nthere is no nakedness, there is no violence, they\nsimply opened an unlocked door, I would say, yes,\nthere would be no recovery, in that circumstance;\nthere would be no damages. There may be cases -- and\nthis is why not -- I'm not arguing there was no\nknock-and-announce violation, in that the police\nshouldn't knock and announce, because, in different\ncases, the consequences may be dramatic, they may be\nsevere, and damages may be severely assessed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, basically, your rule\nis, the police are entitled to take the chance. If\nthey -- if they get inside, and people have got their\nclothes on and there's no gun battle, no problem;\nnothing that the police are exposed to, either by an\nexclusionary rule or by a civil recovery. And if\nthey want to take that chance, if they want to take\nthe chance that somebody will not be dressed or a gun\nwill be pulled, basically that's their option.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think, as in other\nsituations where this Court does not apply the\nexclusionary rule, simply on a deterrence basis --\nbecause the Court does not always apply the\nexclusionary rule, even when there would be\ndeterrence -- that that is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\ntrue. I mean, there are going to be situations, or\nat least possible, where evidence is going to be a --\ncausally connected to a violation of the knock-and-\nannounce rule, right? The situation -- the warrant\nis because these people were involved in a shootout\nwith the -- you know, the Johnson gang; they knock\nthe door down and somebody yells, \"Look out, it's the\nJohnson gang.\"\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they had\nknocked and announced, and \"It's the police,\" they\nwouldn't have that statement that's incriminating.\nNow, you would agree that that statement would be\nexcluded because of the violation, right?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, exactly. That was\nprecisely the point I was going to make, in terms of\na hypothetical. We're not arguing -- as I tried to\nindicate earlier, we're not arguing that you need to\nresolve every question today about what is, or is\nnot, causally related. And there are circumstances\nwhere a spontaneous declaration -- you know, the\npolice break through the door, and the defendant\nsays, \"The drugs are in the closet,\" and you want to\nuse that declaration to tie him to the drugs -- that\nmay well be causally connected. All we're asking\ntoday is for this Court to decide that the items --\nthe physical evidence found within a proper scope, a\nsearch of proper scope of the warrant that's being\nexecuted -- is not causally connected. Other\nquestions of spontaneous declarations, tying the\ndefendant by position to the chair, those may present\ndifferent issues. But the drugs that were named in\nthe search warrant as items to be searched for and\nseized are not causally connected; they are the fruit\nof the execution of the judicial command, not of the\nknock-and-announce violation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I can understand the\nrequirement there be causal connection. Are there\ncases in which courts have held that there was a\nknock-and-announce violation, and there is a general\nremedy of exclusion, unless -- except when there's a\ncausal connection; but, in fact, the evidence was\nadmitted because it was not causally connected to the\nentry?\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I'm not aware of any.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, I can understand\nthe hypothetical, but it seems to me it's really a\nhypothetical.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: Yeah. And I think the\nreason that that exists is because, up til today --\nand Mr. Moran's correct, most courts go the other way\n-- up until the Stevens case, the assumption had been\n-- and I think the assumption has come from Miller\nand Sabbath -- the assumption has been, if there's a\nknock-and-announce violation, you exclude the\nevidence. So, questions of causation have not been\nexplored until the Stevens case, and then the Seventh\nCircuit, in several opinions, has also reached the\nsame conclusion. But I think Sabbath and Miller\npresent very different circumstances. Sabbath and\nMiller, as the Court will recall, were arrest cases.\nAnd the arrest situation does not translate into the\nexecution of a search warrant, because knock-and-\nannounce serves a different purpose, an additional\npurpose, in the arrest situation, that is not served\nwhen -- in the search situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see your argument\nnow. I think your argument is, most of the fourth\namendment rules are really designed to prevent\nwarrantless entries. But this one isn't.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This one is designed to\nprevent damage to property --\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- et cetera. So, let's\nnot have the exclusionary rule and rely on the damage\nremedy where that kind of thing actually occurs,\nwhich isn't often.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if we buy that\nprinciple, suppose we were to apply it in the Miranda\narea -- purpose of a Miranda warning is really to\nmake certain he can have a lawyer, if he wants one,\nfor example. So, now we prove this guy wouldn't have\nasked for a lawyer anyway. All the evidence comes\nin.\nI mean, it's an interesting principle. I\nsee the logic. But it seems to me to have a lot of\nimplications that this Court has never bought.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: I think it's much more\nspeculative in the -- in the fifth-amendment area,\nbut I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can't think of any other\narea, fifth or fourth, where we've bought it. And\nI've tried to explain, in the question, why we\nhaven't bought it. Now, you go ahead.\nMR. BAUGHMAN: But I think to not accept\ncausation as a requirement, which I think this Court\nhas always done -- as I said at the outset, this\nCourt has said that implementation of the\nexclusionary rule is premised on the evidence being\nthe product of the police misconduct. To not do\nthat, to not have a causation requirement, I believe,\nsevers this Court's current exclusionary-rule\ndoctrines from its moorings. There are many\ncircumstances that this Court has, at this point, at\nleast, seen fit to rest with the lower courts, such\nas the execution of a search warrant. You search\nwithin proper scope, you're looking for computer\nmonitors, you find them, but, as you're executing,\nyou open a desk drawer and you shut it, you exceed\nthe scope of the warrant. The law is pretty uniform,\ncurrently, that you don't suppress the computer\nmonitors because you exceeded the scope by opening\nthe drawer. If you found drugs in the drawer, you\nmake -- you'd exclude those. But you don't exclude\nthe monitors, because there's not a causal connection\nbetween the wrong in exceeding the scope of the\nwarrant and the discovery of the monitors.\nAll those cases are up for grabs again if\nthis Court severs the causation requirement from the\napplication of the exclusionary rule. And that's\njust one example; there are others. This Court has\nalways required that there be a causal connection,\nand I believe that it should simply continue to do\nso.\nWe're not asking this Court to overrule any\ncases, to create any really new principles, we're\nsimply asking this Court to understand that Sabbath\nand Miller were knock-and-announce for arrest. With\nan arrest situation, if a person surrenders at the\ndoor, you don't go in and search the premises\nthoroughly. There's a different purpose served in\narrest. With a search warrant, knock-and-announce\nhas no purpose of protecting the privacy of the\ndwelling itself with the discovery of the items named\nin the warrant, and they shouldn't be suppressed.\nThings that are causally connected can be left to an\nargument that may be made by counsel in different\nsituations, but, as to the items named in the warrant\n-- contraband, fruit, spirits, instrumentalities --\nthat should not be suppressed. It is simply not\ncausally connected to the entry, and we would ask\nthis Court to so hold.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe knock-and-announce rule, unlike the\nwarrant and probable cause requirements, does not\nprotect the individual's privacy interest in the\nitems to be searched, and does not relate to the\nofficer's authority to conduct the search and obtain\nthe evidence. An unannounced or premature entry,\ntherefore, does not detract from the officer's legal\nauthority reflected in the warrant to enter and\nconduct a search. Instead, as this Court held in\nSegura, an untainted warrant provides an independent\nsource for the search, even where the entry is\nillegal. There was only one entry in the Segura\ncase, since the officers remained in the apartment\nuntil a warrant was finally obtained.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It depends, of course, on\nwhether you -- what you're doing. Now I see what\nyou're doing. You're applying a kind of Palsgraf\ncausation analysis within the risk -- I think that's\nwhat you're doing -- to saying it's outside, it's not\na cause. You're saying -- you don't say it's not a\nnecessary condition of his being there. It is. You\ndo say, \"Well, the being-in-the-room-there is not\nwithin the risk, the reason for which we have a\nknock-and-announce rule.\" But, of course, that's a\nmatter of judgment. I mean, you could say the\npurpose of the cause -- of the knock-and-announce\nrule is to keep people out of there without knocking\nand announcing. And if that's the purpose of it,\nit's right within the risk, right cause.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You just are looking at\nthe harms that his being there in that room without\nannouncing might bring about. That doesn't mean\nthat's why we don't have the rule. We have the rule\nto keep him out of there without announcing.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, there are --\nthere are several reasons why the Court has -- the\nCourt has articulated several reasons for why there\nis the knock-and-announce rule. We think the\nimportant point, though, with regard to Segura\ncase is that the entry, in Segura, was unlawful both\nbecause the officers did not announce and because\nthey did not have a warrant. They, nonetheless,\nstayed there for 20 hours, and, when they finally did\nobtain a warrant, they conducted the search. And\nthis Court had no difficulty in saying that, even\nthough the initial entry was unlawful, the warrant-\nauthorized search -- the warrant was an independent\nsource for the search, and that the legality with\nregard to the initial entry was, quote, \"wholly\nirrelevant to the evidence that was obtained pursuant\nto the warrant.\" And we would submit that it would\nbe an odd fourth amendment rule that would allow\nadmission of the evidence where the officers failed\nto obtain a warrant. They entered without a warrant\nand without announcement, and only later obtained\none, as in Segura; and then suppress all evidence, in\nthis case, where the officers did obtain a warrant in\nadvance, and their only illegality was the much more\nminor one of entering a few moments prematurely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What was the --\nMR. SALMONS: Nothing in this Court's cases\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry, I didn't mean\nto interrupt.\nMR. SALMONS: No, that's fine, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, What\nwas -- what were the grounds upon which the warrant,\nin Segura, was obtained?\nMR. SALMONS: The warrant, in Segura, was\nobtained by -- based on evidence that was in\nexistence prior to the unlawful entry, so that it was\nan untainted warrant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, it didn't -- it didn't\ndepend on the entry or anything gained as a result of\nthe entry, right?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, of course, the officers\n-- once that warrant was obtained, officers would\nhave to enter the apartment in order to conduct a\nsearch --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the --\nMR. SALMONS: -- here, except for the fact\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but the --\nMR. SALMONS: -- they had already entered\nillegally and were already present illegally --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the warrant --\nMR. SALMONS: -- in the apartment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the warrant -- the\nwarrant itself didn't depend on anything they had\ngained as a result of the entry. There was no --\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- kind of causal --\nMR. SALMONS: -- in Segura.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- continuum there.\nMR. SALMONS: That's absolutely correct,\nand that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, you do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't --\nMR. SALMONS: -- a requirement for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the difference,\nthough, with this case? Because, here, there is a\ncausal continuum, at least, as Justice Breyer said, a\nbut-for causal continuum. They wouldn't have been in\nthe apartment but for the entry. And so, the\nauthority of the warrant and the manner of executing\nthe warrant are not divisible the way they were in\nSegura.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, with respect, I\nthink that's -- it would be an improper reading of\nSegura. There was an illegal entry, in Segura, that\nwas just as necessary in order to conduct the search\nand obtain evidence in that case as there was at\npremature entry here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, in Segura, the court\nissuing the subsequent warrant says, \"You can -- you\ncan go in there and do this.\" The court -- by the\nway, I -- maybe this makes it even easier -- did the\ncourt, in Segura, know that they were in the\napartment?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SALMONS: Their -- they had no\nknowledge of the illegality, and the evidence that\nwas -- that was the basis for the affidavit for the\nwarrant was untainted by the illegal entry. But, of\ncourse, the same is true here, there was -- there is\nno allegation at all that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no --\nMR. SALMONS: -- the warrant in this case -\n-\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the difference is --\nMR. SALMONS: -- is tainted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, look, this --\nyou know, I'd appreciate your explaining this -- this\nseems to me what you're saying in your brief was the\ninevitable discovery. The inevitable-discovery rule,\nin my -- the way -- the way I've thought of it, and\nI'd like you to correct me if I haven't thought of it\ncorrectly -- to use a kind of analogy, it's like a\nprimitive tribe that beats a tom-tom every morning so\nthe sun comes up. Hey, the sun's going to come up\nanyway, and the bodies are going to be discovered\nanyway, in those cases. And, in Segura, the warrant\nis going to be issued anyway. So, it isn't a\nquestion of whether it would have been issued if they\nhad behaved properly, it's a question of what will\nreally happen in the absence of the illegality.\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's what I thought\ninevitable discovery here was, and, in the absence of\nthese people entering the apartment illegally, they\nwouldn't have found a thing, because --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- there was nothing else\nin motion.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, with respect,\nthat is -- that is directly at odds with the way the\nCourt, in Segura, approached --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, which --\nMR. SALMONS: -- the question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- case is contrary to\nwhat I said?\nMR. SALMONS: I think Segura is contrary to\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Segura?\nMR. SALMONS: I think Murray --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have just said --\nMR. SALMONS: -- is contrary to that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that, in Segura, they\nwould have gotten in, anyway, under a legal warrant\nthat had nothing whatsoever to do with the illegal\nentry.\nMR. SALMONS: In fact, that is precisely\nthe analysis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The sun rose, anyway.\nMR. SALMONS: -- that's precisely the\nanalysis the Court ordered -- took in Segura. It\nsaid, if there had been no illegal entry, the\nofficers --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. SALMONS: -- would have obtained the\nevidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exact --\nMR. SALMONS: -- the same way --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Well --\nMR. SALMONS: -- because they had --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- not \"would have.\" Did.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your -- I'm just\ninforming Your Honor what the Segura case says. It\nsays the court -- the courts would have found --\nexcuse me -- the officers would have found the same\nevidence that they found pursuant to the warrant if\nthey had complied with the fourth amendment. That's\nbecause the court viewed the -- that warrant as a\nseparate independent source for the authority to\nenter and conduct a search. One would have to posit,\nI guess, that the officers in this case, if they --\nif they would rather not execute the warrant than\ndelay a few additional moments before entering, but I\nthink that would not be a very realistic hypothesis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then your --\nMR. SALMONS: Now, with regard --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- position is that you\nnever -- if you have a warrant, then you can seize\nwhat the warrant lists. So, if you have a warrant,\nthen there is never a reason that the police would\nhave to knock and announce, because the warrant gives\nthem independent authority to enter. That seems to\nbe what you're saying, that as long as you have a\nwarrant, there -- the knock-and-announce does not\nhave to be complied with.\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The knock-\nand-announce requirement is -- we take no issue with\nthat. That is required by the fourth amendment.\nWith regard --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --\nMR. SALMONS: -- to deterrence --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- but in this very case\nyou had an officer who said it was his regular policy\n--\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- never to knock and\nannounce --\nMR. SALMONS: That's not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to just go in. So,\nif the rule you propose is adopted, then every police\nofficer in America can follow the same policy. Is\nthere no policy of protecting the homeowner a little\nbit --\nMR. SALMONS: Of course the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- and the sanctity of\nthe home --\nMR. SALMONS: Of course there is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- from this immediate -\n-\nMR. SALMONS: -- Your Honor, and that is\nnot --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- entry?\nMR. SALMONS: -- our position. And we,\nrespectfully, would argue that that's not an\nappropriate way to conduct the deterrence analysis.\nEven just on the terms of deterrence, we think that\nsuppression here would be a disproportionate remedy.\nAnd that's because, as this Court has repeatedly\nrecognized, the officers already have an incentive,\ninherent in the nature of the circumstances, to\nannounce and delay some period of time before entry.\nNow, there may be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what --\nMR. SALMONS: -- not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wait a minute. What is\nthis incentive inherent in the circumstances?\nMR. SALMONS: It's not to be mistaken for\nan intruder and shot at, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't seem to\nwork.\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, you've got -- this\nis a case in which the officer testifies, \"It never\nworks, I always go in.\"\nMR. SALMONS: That's not really -- I mean,\nto be fair, Your Honor, that's not what he testified\nto, exactly. What he said was, he's been shot at\nseveral times, and he went in early, in this case, in\npart because of his safety concerns. But he didn't\nspeak to any broader policy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When is it going --\nMR. SALMONS: But, in any event, the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, what reason do we\nhave to believe that this incentive inherent in\ncircumstances is ever going to work in the absence of\nan exclusionary rule?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, I think --\nI think there are several reasons. One -- and,\nagain, this Court -- these are -- all of the things\nI'm going to list come from this Court's cases,\nincluding Nix and Murray and Segura, where the Court\nhas applied the doctrines we ask the Court to apply\nhere. And what you have is, you have the inherent\nincentive to knock and announce, because of their own\nsafety concerns. We think the only thing that might\nnot cover, in terms of deterrence, would be the\nadditional few moments you may want them to wait.\nThey will announce, and they will delay some period\nof time.\nNow, in the absence of concerns about\nsafety or destruction of evidence, the officers have\nnothing to gain by entering prematurely. And so, in\ndoing a deterrence analysis, I think it's important\nto keep that in mind. It's not like there's a huge\ngain for the officers --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't they --\nMR. SALMONS: -- when they don't have\nlegitimate concerns.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't they have\nsomething to gain? If they're right that there is\nevidence inside, they gain. They're -- I mean,\nthey're perfectly rational --\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in this. They gain a\ngreater chance of getting that evidence than if they\nlet a few seconds elapse and the evidence can be\nflushed away.\nMR. SALMONS: To be sure, Your Honor, there\nare times when they may miscalculate the nature of\nthe concerns about safety and destruction of\nevidence, but, in cases where there aren't those\nconcerns, they have nothing to gain. And, in\naddition, entering prematurely may make them a\ndefendant in 1983 or Bivens actions, which I'm sure\nthat no officer --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: For --\nMR. SALMONS: -- relishes and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: For which there is no\nrecord of any recovery in any court in the United\nStates, isn't that correct?\nMR. SALMONS: May I answer, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would -- I\nwould disagree with that. And I would point the\nCourt, in particular, to a recent case out of the\nSeventh Circuit, Jones versus Wilhelm. The seventh\ncircuit has announced the position -- it decided the\nposition that we advocate. There are many cases,\nYour Honor -- the courts -- the courts are replete\nwith them -- where people --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank --\nMR. SALMONS: -- bring those types of\nclaims, and win, and then they settle.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moran, you have\n4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. MORAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst of all, as to the evidence that is\ncausally connected to the knock-and-announce\nviolation, there are two reasons why the remote\npossibility of such evidence will never deter police\nofficers from violating the knock-and-announce\nrequirement. The first is that it's very remote.\nI'm not aware of a single case in American history\nwhere there has been identified such evidence that is\ndirectly causally related only to the knock-and-\nannounce violation. But the second reason, more\nfundamental, is that even if there were such\nevidence, by definition the possibility of finding\nsuch evidence will not deter the police from\ncommitting a knock-and-announce violation, because\nthey wouldn't have found that evidence had they\ncomplied with the knock-and-announce requirement. In\nother words, the police would only gain that evidence\nby committing the knock-and-announce violation, so\nthere would be nothing lost in going ahead and\nrisking an excited utterance that they wouldn't be\nable to use, because, by definition, they wouldn't be\ngetting that excited utterance, anyway.\nI think it's important, with the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief, to rebut the claim that Miller and\nSabbath had something to do with the fact that there\nwas no warrant in those cases. Nothing in Miller and\nSabbath turned on the absence of a warrant. And, in\nfact, in Miller the Court specifically said, \"The\nrequirements stated in Semayne's case still obtains.\nIt applies, as the Government here concedes, whether\nthe arrest is to be made by virtue of a warrant or\nwhen officers are authorized to make an arrest for a\nfelony without a warrant.\" The Government conceded,\nin Miller, that whether there was a warrant or not\nhad nothing to do with the knock-and-announce\nviolation in that case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the Government's\ndistinction was based on the fact that they were\narrest cases. I thought that's the distinction they\nwere making.\nMR. MORAN: Perhaps I misread their brief,\nJustice Scalia, but I thought it was that there was\nan absence of a warrant. Of course, this is an\narrest case, as well. The -- Mr. Hudson was seized,\nand was searched, incident to arrest. And so, this\nwas also an arrest case, much like Miller and\nSabbath.\nAs for the causal-connection argument, if\nthis Court were to accept it, I listed, in my\nprincipal brief, a litany of cases that I think would\nhave to be overruled -- Katz, Knowles, Silverthorne\nLumber -- for that matter, Kyllo. All those cases\nsay that it doesn't matter that the Government has a\nclear, lawful route to get the evidence; the fact\nthat they didn't follow that clear, lawful route\nprevents the Government from using that evidence.\nAnd it's impossible to explain how Mr. Baughman's\ncausation theory is consonant with all of those\ncases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. MORAN: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the --\nisn't the reason it's consonant is because, in those\ncases, there is a -- the connection, in terms of the\npurposes of the rule that was violated and the\nevidence that was seized?\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think the\nsame thing applies here. I think that the knock-and-\nannounce rule is about the sanctity of the home. And\nthis Court could not have said it any more clearly in\nWilson, that the reasonableness of a search or\nseizure inside a home is connected to the method of\nentry. In fact, the Court said it three times, in\nWilson, in various ways. And so, I think it is the\npurpose of the knock-and-announce rule, is to protect\nthe homeowner's right of privacy against shock,\nfright, and embarrassment that can come with a\nprecipitous police entry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not the general\nprivacy of the home, because you don't dispute that\nif he had waited an additional 4 seconds, he could\nhave entered the home and executed the warrant.\nMR. MORAN: No, we don't dispute that at\nall, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFinally, I have to ask why this Court has\ndecided all these knock-and-announce cases in the\nlast 10 years, if my opponents are right. This Court\nshouldn't have -- they're all criminal cases, and\nthis Court should have simply said the Petitioners or\nRespondents, as the case may be, cannot obtain the\nrelief they are seeking, because the knock-and-\nannounce rule is not causally related to the evidence\nthat they're trying to suppress. And so, if this\nCourt were to adopt my opponent's position, the\nknock-and-announce rule will become a dead letter.\nThere will be virtually no cases, there will be\nvirtually no more development of this rule. This\nCourt would have been wrong in Miller, it would have\nbeen wrong in Sabbath, and it was wrong to reach the\nsubstantive constitutional questions it reached in\nBanks, Richards, Ramirez, and Wilson. And all the\nother courts, the -- virtually every State currently\nsuppressing evidence seized after a knock-and-\nannounce -- well, they would have to be wrong, too.\nAnd so, a lot of courts, including this Court, have\nbeen wrong a lot of times, if my opponent is correct.\nFinally, one last word on Segura. Segura\nis the sort of case where one can make a respectable\ninevitable-discovery -- in fact, a winning\ninevitable-discovery or independent-source argument.\nBut the key thing in Segura is, this Court did not\ndisturb the fact that the evidence that was seized\nduring the initial entry was suppressed, because that\nwas directly connected to the unlawful entry. And\nso, the evidence that the police initially seized,\nbefore the 19-hour wait in Segura, was suppressed.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
