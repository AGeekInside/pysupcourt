        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 08-1119, Milavetz,\nGallop & Milavetz v. United States and United\nStates v. Milavetz.\nMr. Brunstad.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &\nMILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 526(a)(4) is unconstitutional\nbecause it proscribes truthful information about\nentirely lawful activity, it whipsaws the attorneys who\nare trying to apply it, it creates an impossible\nsituation for them, and it harms the client.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were confined to\nunlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede\nthat such a statute would be constitutional?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but\nthe real challenge is to actually do that narrowing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say \"perhaps.\" Yes or\nno? Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately\ndrawn narrow statute, prohibit attorneys from advising,\nA, criminal conduct in reference to a bankruptcy; or, B,\ncivil conduct -- conduct that is improper under the\ncivil code because it's a fraud on creditors?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy, if it\nwere narrowly drawn to apply to criminal activity or\nfraudulent activity, yes. Those terms have\nwell-established meanings. We know how to apply them.\nThis statute, of course, does not do that.\nNow, the government does not defend the\nstatute as written. The government seeks to rewrite it,\nbut the manner in which the government seeks to rewrite\nthe statute really doesn't work under the statutory\nterms. We do not have that guidance.\nThe government in its brief proposes three\ndifferent formulations of how it might be narrowed.\nNone of those work, even if we -- we were to accept any\nof those formulations. We don't know what \"abusive\nconduct\" means. The government simply would trade a\nFirst Amendment problem for a vagueness problem. We do\nnot have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's already in\nthe statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer\nwho signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does\nnot constitute an abuse. This is 707(b).\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the words are\nsomething like \"does not constitute an abuse.\" So\napparently it has meaning there. Why doesn't -- why\ndon't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also\nmeans in 5, whatever it is.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Two reasons, Justice\nGinsburg. First, the 707(b) abuse standard is a\ncompletely different context. It involves gatekeeping\nto the access to bankruptcy relief.\nThe second reason is that Congress -- there\nis no indication whatsoever, in the legislative history\nor elsewhere, that Congress intended to import the abuse\nstandard under Section 707 into the 526(a)(4) context.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again in the\nhypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a\nstatute what it requires in the attestation clause?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Kennedy, because\nthe abuse standard is too nebulous to satisfy, I think,\nscrutiny under the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think the attestation\nclause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It can be the basis for\nsanctioning an attorney --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, how can that be if\nit's too vague.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nthat the gateway to the bankruptcy procedures or\nbasically provisions, like section 707 or in the Chapter\n11 context, basically are equitable inquiry that looks\ninto the totality of the circumstances, whether what the\nlawyer has done or what the debtor has done -- and\nreally it looks to what the debtor has done -- would be\nsuch that it would deny access to bankruptcy relief.\nHas the debtor engaged in inequitable conduct, engaged\nin inequitable conduct in some way that would basically\nshut the door to bankruptcy relief?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The attestation clause is\ndesigned to ensure that the attorney has performed in an\nethical and proper way, I take it.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In a sense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that one of its\npurposes?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think it goes more towards\nthe attorney checking the information that the debtor\nhas basically provided in the petition and elsewhere to\nmake sure that the information that's provided is\naccurate and that the bankruptcy petition is not being\nproposed in essence for an abusive purpose.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I won't take up too much\nmore of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that\nyou can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute\nthat does the same thing. I don't understand the\nprinciple for that. You say it's a gateway and it's\ndesigned to facilitate the bankruptcy process. Well,\nthe government could say the same thing about its\nstatute.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Except, I think, Your Honor,\nthat whereas for the purposes of getting into bankruptcy\nor staying in bankruptcy is one standard that courts\napply basically on an equitable basis, that analysis --\nwhat Congress did there, it didn't have in mind First\nAmendment concerns. It didn't have in mind trying to\nnarrowly tailor the statutory regime so that lawyers\nbasically can understand what they are doing in a way\nand communicate it to their client.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Congress often\nforgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's true, Your Honor, and\nthat's the heart of the problem here. The problem here\nis that when Congress basically -- first of all,\nCongress didn't import the 707(b) standard into\n526(a)(4).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the words in\n707(b)? I mean, they are both in the statute. What the\nlawyer has to attest to is required by statute.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That is true, Justice\nGinsburg. But there is no evidence that Congress, in\nthe legislative history or otherwise, that Congress\nintended the 707{b} standard to be the standard that\ngoverns what the lawyer can tell the client under\nsection 526 (a)(4).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there another\nproblem? Even if Congress didn't think of the problem,\ndon't we have the duty to construe the statute to avoid\nconstitutional problems if there is any reasonable basis\nfor doing so?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens, but\nthis statute is not reasonable susceptible to the\ngovernment's interpretation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That is an entirely\ndifferent argument from the fact that Congress didn't\nthink of this problem.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Justice\nStevens. But the problem here is that what the\ngovernment has tried to do is tease out a standard from\nthe \"in contemplation of\" language in 526(a)(4), and the\nproblem is that -- two problems: One, the \"in\ncontemplation of\" language only modifies half the\nstatute, so the \"or pay the attorney\" prong is not even\naddressed by the government's construction. They kind\nof ignore that.\nThe second problem is that the \"in\ncontemplation of\" language cannot bear the weight the\ngovernment would have it bear.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you think that\nmeans? What do you think \"in contemplation of\nbankruptcy\" means?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think it means what the\nCourt said it meant in the Pender case interpreting\nsection 60(d) of the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898.\nThat is, whether bankruptcy is likely or imminent; in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy, taking some action where a\nbankruptcy case is imminent or likely.\nNow, it appears --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say someone goes\nto the lawyer and they discuss the person's debt\nsituation and the decision is made that a bankruptcy\npetition is going to be filed at some future date. Do\nyou think that everything that that person does after\nthat point is done in contemplation of bankruptcy?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not necessarily, Justice\nAlito?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well then, why not? The\nperson drives home in contemplation of bankruptcy, the\nperson has lunch in contemplation of bankruptcy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think that would --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't it mean -- \"in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy\" means because of the\nexpectation of filing a bankruptcy petition later?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think that that would\nassume that the filing of the bankruptcy petition looms\nentirely in the consciousness of the debtor when the\ndebtor does everything. But I do -- I do think that the\n\"in contemplation of\" clause, which is also used in\nsection 529, is a neutral phrase. \"In contemplation of\"\nmeans nothing more than is the bankruptcy filing likely?\nIt doesn't have any nefarious, it doesn't have any\nabusive context to it at all.\nFor example, section 329 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. It doesn't mean is\nit likely. \"In contemplation of\" means that the reason\nyou are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy. You\ndon't see any causal connection in that phrase?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I do see a causal connection,\nbut there is no element of doing something improper in\nthe language \"in contemplation of.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. That\nmay be true enough. But -- but the act must be taken\nbecause you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia. But the\ngovernment relies and hinges its argument on the abusive\nconnotation to the \"in contemplation of.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different\nquestion.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That doesn't exist. So what\nthe government is trying to do is rewrite the statute by\nimporting meaning into a phrase that has never been\nthere and doesn't exist there.\nEvery time we see the \"in contemplation of\"\nphrase appearing either under the current law or under a\nprior law, if there was some element of abuse coupled\nwith it that was separately stated, and of course there\nis no separate statement here.\nNow, again I go back to the fact that this\n-- the practical effect of section 526(a)(4) is to make\nan impossible situation for attorneys. We have two\nregimes: One under applicable normal ethical State bar\nrules which say you have to give unfettered candid\nadvice to your client; and this provision which gives\nyou must give truncated advice; there are thing you\ncannot say. But whether you are in one regime or\nanother depends upon whether the debtor is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a -- is there a\ndifference between unethical and illegal advice?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As an attorney can you\nunder -- give unethical advice?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, I think so, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the State rules\nyou can give unethical advice as a lawyer?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: You cannot, no. That is\nproscribed by the State rules.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if you are not\npermitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would\notherwise give you that right? I mean, this is a\ncommercial transaction of sorts. It's a fiduciary duty,\nbut it's a commercial transaction. They are coming to\nyou and they are paying you for certain advice, so why\nwould the person then protect your right to give\nunethical advice.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It wouldn't protect your\nright to give unethical advice. The problem is that the\nstatute sweeps within it's scope perfectly truthful\nadvice about lawful activity.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are assuming that\nit's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive\nconduct.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. But just as --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming that is read\ninto the statute or is viewed as part of \"in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy,\" what in the First\nAmendment would make that be?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The First Amendment would not\nprotect unethical advice. The problem, though, is that\nthe term \"abusive\" which the government wants to\ninterlineate into the statute is itself inherently\nvague, unlike \"fraudulent conduct --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which doesn't explain\nwhy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because \"abusive,\" it's like\n\"seditious utterances.\" It's not something which a\nnormal person who just looks at it would be able to\nunderstand what it means.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't understand\nwhat it means as a lawyer?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I have some ideas about what\nmeans. But because of the onerous sanctions that\nsection 526(c) imposes, if I'm wrong I can be basically\nsubject to a whole panoply of remedies, some very\nserious remedies and very serious punishments for making\na mistake. And that's one of the problems under the\nFirst Amendment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if you leave \"abusive\"\nout. Let's accept your point that \"abusive\" is not\nthere and the government is reading in out of nowhere.\nWhat's -- what's the matter with the statute then?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I'll give you -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just prohibits giving\nadvice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody\nincur more debt. What's unlawful about that?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I'll give you -- I'll\ngive you a perfect example. Suppose the debtor's\nproblem is that he lives in a house that is too\nexpensive for him. He comes to the lawyer: I'm in\nfinancial distress. The lawyer suggests -- the lawyer\nwould logically suggest: Why don't you sell your house\nand rent an apartment? But the signing of the lease is\nincurring debt, the lease obligation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It would be, Justice Scalia,\nif the debtor comes to you in financial distress, is\nthinking about filing for bankruptcy, and wants the\nadvice in that context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the only reason the\nlawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this --\nthat this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he\nsays, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better\nsell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no\ngood. Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why\nit's -- why it's unconstitutional.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because it's perfectly\nlegitimate advice about perfectly lawful activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's a stupid law.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, what happens is that\nbasically it interferes with the lawyer's ability\nthrough speech to communicate full and candid advice to\nthe client.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And that's why\nit's a stupid law.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And ultimately under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, where is the\nprohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, I think the\nproblem here is that this stupid law does not pass\neither strict scrutiny and it is substantially\noverbroad.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much of your\ncase depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if\nyou accept the idea that \"in contemplation of\" means\nabusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends\nupon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that\nit's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer\nsort of has to stop and think at every turn: Well,\ncould this be construed as recommending abuse, or is\nthis just construed as telling clients what they can and\ncan't do? And in some areas it's a gray area, and what\nshould you do when it's a gray area?\nIs that -- does your case depend upon that,\nwhich is, I guess, just an issue with the limiting\nconstruction proposed by the Solicitor General?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It doesn't turn on that, but\nthat demonstrates the chilling effect. The effect of\nthe statute has been to drive conscientious bankruptcy\ncounsel from the practice. Why? Because it's not just\ndifficult to apply; it's often impossible to apply. The\nwhole statute turns on whether the debtor, the client or\nprospective client, is an assisted person, which depends\non the relative wealth of the client, which is something\nvery, very difficult to determine at any particular\ngiven point in time.\nSo the lawyer doesn't know: Am I restricted\nin my speech under 526(a)(4) because that applies or\ndoes 526(a)(4) not apply at all because I am not dealing\nwith an assisted person, such that I am under normal\nState bar rules which requires me to give unfettered\nadvice?\nAnd since that is impossible to know without\ndetailed, careful analysis of the relative wealth of the\nclient, the statute is basically impossible to apply.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if we assume a\nproper limited construction -- I know you disagree with\nthat, but if we assume that we can limit the statute\nproperly so that it applies just to unethical conduct,\nthen you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact\nthat assisted persons is a subclass of that is\nirrelevant.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That would be true, Justice\nKennedy, if in fact we could tease out from the abusive\nconduct, if people could actually understand what\n\"abusive\" meant. Does that proscribe -- what does it\nproscribe? It's too vague.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but that doesn't go\nto your other point that there's a problem in\ndetermining the class of persons. If it's unethical,\nyou can't give it to anybody. And the fact that the\nclass of persons is difficult to understand\nis irrelevant.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy, but\nthat assumes that we can do the narrowing construction,\nI think as Your Honor points out. And that, again, is a\nfundamental problem because the standard the government\nwould like to impose or interlineate in the statute is\nentirely vague.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You want to -- I mean,\nyour first point is -- and we never get to that question\nbecause lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all.\nThey shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our\npoint on the statutory construction piece is that the\nstatute is ambiguous and that to avoid the\nconstitutional questions -- actually, avoid two\nconstitutional questions here, the constitutional\nquestion under 526(a)(4) and then a separate\nconstitutional question under 528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's only lawyers who are\nprotected against vague criminal statutes?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly not, Justice\nScalia, which is why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So then -- so then there is\nno reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just\nto make it constitutional.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, our argument there,\nJustice Scalia, is that the statute does not\nunambiguously embrace attorneys. \"Attorney\" is not\nmentioned in the definition of \"debt relief agency\" in\n101(12)(a) where you think it would be, because wherever\nCongress has otherwise intended to regulate attorneys in\nconnection with bankruptcy practice, it has used the\nword \"attorney\" specifically.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. If you -- if\nyou are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a\nfine argument. But don't -- don't bring in the fact\nthat, well then, moreover, if it's applied to attorneys,\nit's unconstitutional, because if it's applied to\nanybody it's unconstitutional according to your\nargument.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That is also true, Justice\nScalia, because we do make a substantial overbreadth\nargument. The statute is substantially overbroad.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, but when you say it\nisn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to. It\nsays \"The term 'debt relief agency' means 'any person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson.\" And the term \"bankruptcy assistance\" is\ndefined to include \"appearing in a case or proceeding on\nbehalf of another or providing legal representation with\nrespect to a case or proceeding.\"\nDoesn't a lawyer provide legal\nrepresentation?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: A lawyer does, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So doesn't the\nterm \"provide legal representation\" include a lawyer?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, Justice Breyer,\nis that I think when Your Honor was quoting from section\n101(4A), Your Honor took out a whole lot of information\nthat goes between the word \"bankruptcy assistance\" and\n\"legal representation.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes; they include other\npeople besides lawyers.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not only that, but I think\nthat that language is inherently ambiguous. What is\nCongress getting at there?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. What is it\ngetting at with \"providing legal representation with\nrespect to a case\"?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That would seem to be with\nrespect to lawyers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would seem to be a\nlawyer.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But it's precluded -- it's\npreceded by language, \"any goods or services sold or\notherwise provided to an assisted person with the\nexpress or implied purpose of providing information, et\ncetera, about legal representation.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Those are other\npeople who are covered.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, not just other people,\nbut what it looks like, is it looks like what Congress\nwas getting at was people who provide things like what\nattorneys provide.\nNow, there are a whole host of problems with\nincluding attorneys within the definition of \"debt\nrelief agency.\" I mean, it's counter -- it's contrary\nto the purpose of what Congress seemed to be getting at.\nIt leads to anomalous results. It does various things.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it any different\nfrom including lawyers within the category \"debt\ncollectors,\" which lawyers objected to in this Court\nunsuccessfully?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But\nthere it was interesting. There, there -- in the Heintz\ncase, that was a situation where lawyers had been\nexpressly excluded from the statutory regime, then\nCongress repealed the exclusion, so a clear signal to\ninclude attorneys.\nHere, we have the opposite. We have a very\nambiguous legislative history, where in the initial\nversion of this legislation the House report\naccompanying it said lawyers were included and the\nlanguage was \"debt relief counseling agency.\" Then\nCongress amended the statute -- Congress amended the\nproposed legislation in 1999, and thereafter in the\n2001, 2003, and 2005 House reports deleted all reference\nto attorneys -- a very, very strange tale, which seems\nto signal exactly the opposite of the Heintz case.\nSo we have a very ambiguous legislative\nhistory that seems to give us a contrary signal. That\nin part is part of the ambiguity behind this statute,\nwhich I think is one of the reasons why it's perfectly\n-- the statute is readily susceptible to an\ninterpretation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that in the\nlegislative history there were examples of lawyers\noverreaching, that the conduct that Congress was aiming\nat was engaged in by lawyers, as well as others.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: There are some references in\nthe legislative history to that, Justice Ginsburg.\nThere are a few scattered references in the legislative\nhistory.\nBut again, the legislative history is very\nambiguous. It seems to go in lots of different\ndirections. Now, recall, Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have heard of referring\nto legislative history when the statute is ambiguous. I\nhaven't heard of referring to legislative history to\nmake the statute ambiguous.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. I\nthink the statute is ambiguous for a whole host of\nreasons, and the legislative history does not clear up\nthe ambiguity; it actually deepens it. So the\nlegislative history reinforces the other indicators, the\ntextual indicators, of in fact ambiguity here.\nBut I think -- I think it is also important\nto underscore not only would the constitutional\navoidance, application of that canon here, by excluding\nattorneys from debt relief agencies solve the problem\nunder section 526(a)(4), but also under section\n528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B). 528 --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before you go on on 528,\ncould you clarify for me: What is your challenge to\n528? Is it a normal --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: 528, Justice Sotomayor?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 528.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it a normal facial\ninvalidity? Is it an overbreadth invalidity? Is it an\nas-applied challenge? What exactly are you claiming\nwith respect to that --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Does Your Honor mean 526 or\n528?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 528.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: 528. 528, the disclosures in\nthe advertising provision?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We are challenging that on\nas-applied it violates the Constitution --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me how you\nhave an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what\nad is at issue?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. I think\nit's the same as the Cincinnati case, where in fact\nthere was no obligation that the handbills that were\nbeing distributed were any way deceptive or misleading.\nThat's the same situation here. The district court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I have scoured the\nrecord for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- by you that I could\nlook at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's\nnot misleading. So where is it in the record?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The ads are not in the\nrecord. But, as the district court found, there is no\nevidence suggesting that bankruptcy assistance\nadvertisements that -- that Petitioners' bankruptcy\nadvertisements are deceptive in any regard. The\ngovernment never alleged that Petitioners engaged in any\ndeceptive advertising. That's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I truly have never\nheard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what\nit is being applied to. But putting that aside, so you\nhave an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial\nchallenge or an overbreadth challenge?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: With respect to the\nadvertisements with the commercial speech?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR. Yes, the 528.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, it's not a -- it's not a\nfacial challenge; it's an as-applied challenge. But\nhere -- here's the point on the evidentiary point. The\ngovernment never sought to introduce that evidence\nbecause it's not at issue. There is no dispute that\nPetitioners' advertisement is not -- is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the government bring\nthis lawsuit below?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: We brought this lawsuit as a\ndeclaratory judgment action.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what, were they\nsupposed to scour your advertisements to find the\nviolation? Was that it?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, unless there was an\nallegation that in some way Petitioners' advertisements\nwere misleading. It's not. It's not a disputed\nquestion. It's not a disputed factual question.\nThere is no dispute, and the district court\nbasically found that there is no allegation that\nPetitioners' advertising is deceptive or untruthful in\nany way. So Petitioners' advertising is not of the kind\nthat Congress was trying to target.\nNow, the problem and the burden that 528\nimposes is that it requires counterfactual, misleading\nstatements that interfere with legitimate advertising\nmessages. That's the problem. The statute is not\nnarrowly tailored under Central Hudson to address the\n\"make debts disappear\" problem the government identifies\nas animating this particular statute.\nLet me give a simple illustration to sort of\nillustrate my point. Suppose I sell bread and the\ngovernment required me to say -- disclose: I am a bread\nsupply agency; I sell products that contain wheat.\nWell, what if the bread I sell does not contain wheat,\nit's wheat-free? Forcing me to make that statement is\ncounterfactual and misleading. That's what this statute\ndoes. If I also sell milk, it requires me to make the\nstatement: I am the bread relief -- the bread supply\nagency --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you\nsomething? When you are an attorney advertising as an\nattorney who gives advice on bankruptcy, why aren't you\na debt release -- relief advisor?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, Justice\nSotomayor, is that that statement inherently is\nmisleading. When lawyers -- when clients look for\nlawyers, bankruptcy lawyers or just lawyers in general,\nthey don't want to see someone called a debt relief\nagency. It conveys no meaningful information. In fact,\nit's misleading. What does that mean?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They don't want to be --\nlawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either,\nand in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says\nthat -- that communication must say the communication is\nfrom a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are\nnot -- you don't have to identify. It seems to me that\nthat -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do,\nto identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt\ncollector, than I am a debt relief agency.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, but the debt collection\nstatute doesn't require that in advertising. It\nrequires that in letters and things like that that go to\nother parties where you are actually trying to help\ncollect the debt. So it's a communication that the\nlawyer is making, for example, and a disclosure that's\nrequired.\nHere putting in your advertising \"I'm a debt\nrelief agency\" conveys no meaningful information to the\npublic. In fact, it is misleading.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, A, I suppose you\ndon't have to advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in\nyour bread hypo: Under the Federal law we have bread,\nbut our bread is -- I don't know -- gluten-free or\nwhatever. You can use --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can always add -- add\nin order to make it non-misleading.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But that would require a\nstatement in our advertising that is actually -- to make\nit fundamentally dissimilar to the statement that's\nbeing actually imposed on us, we have to say -- we have\nto put in the advertising something like \"This product\ncontains wheat.\" Then we also have to say, but my\nproduct doesn't.\nSo, for the consumer who is looking at the\ninformation, it's inherently misleading because the two\nconflict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a proposal for a\ncommercial transaction, right? You are trying to get a\nconsumer to hire you. And the First Amendment standards\nfor proposals for commercial transactions have always\nbeen more -- more lenient than other First Amendment\ncontexts.\nWe -- we -- we regulate the content of\nadvertising all the time.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia, but this\nstatute is odd because it requires counterfactual\ninformation, it's not narrowly drawn to address the\nproblem the government identifies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If a law firm -- if a law\nfirm provides representation for debtors in bankruptcy,\nwhat is misleading about requiring them to say: We help\npeople file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy\nCode?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because the scope of\n528(b)(2)(B) is so broad. If I am advertising mortgage\nforeclosure services having nothing to do with\nbankruptcy, I still must make this counterfactual\nstatement. 528 -- for example, in my bread\nhypothetical, if I am also selling milk, and the\ngovernment says when I am selling milk through my milk\nadvertisement I have to say I am a bread supply agency,\nI sell products that contain wheat, that is misleading\nand irrelevant to the milk advertisement.\nBut this statute does the same thing. If I\nam advertising eviction protection services having\nnothing to do with bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure\nservices representation having nothing to do with the\nbankruptcy, I have to make these counterfactual\nstatements that are inherently misleading.\nIf there are no questions at the moment, I\nwould like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Brunstad.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to begin with the threshold\nstatutory question if I may. I have only a few points\non that.\nA debt relief agency is any person who\nprovides specified services to specified clients for\npay. An attorney is a person, a defined term under the\nBankruptcy Code, and the Petitioners have affirmatively\nalleged in their complaint that they provide bankruptcy\nassistance to assisted persons. We think that is all\nthat is required to determine that they are debt relief\nagencies under the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the provision\nthat says the directors, employees, are not included?\nMR. JAY: As I understand Petitioners'\nargument about that provision, it is that Congress would\nsurely have made an exception for partners as well had\nit intended to include attorneys. We think that that is\na multi-step chain of reasoning that breaks down at each\nstep.\nCongress made an exception from the\ndefinition of \"debt relief agencies\" for officers and\nemployees of the business that is itself a debt relief\nagency. Partnerships, of course, have employees as\nwell, and a run-of-the-mill employee of a partnership\nwho doesn't provided the bankruptcy assistance services\nhimself is not himself a debt relief agency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about an associate?\nMR. JAY: I think, Justice Ginsburg, an\nassociate is an employee, so if the associate in a law\nfirm provides -- doesn't provide the bankruptcy\nassistance herself, then she is not a debt relief\nagency. It's the -- because any person is defined under\nthe Bankruptcy Code to include individual partnership or\ncorporation. That is Section 101(41). It's the law\nfirm that provides the services, is a person who\nprovides the services and therefore a debt relief\nagency. I suppose an individual who provides the\nservices himself or herself might be an agency, a debt\nrelief agency, as well.\nBut we don't think that the absence of a\nspecific exception for partners of a partnership tells\nus anything that would derogate from the plain meaning\nof the defined terms in the statute. The fact that\npartners are liable for actions of the partnership is a\ncommonplace of partnership law. And it's also not the\ncase that all attorneys practice in partnerships. The\nPetitioner law firm is a professional corporation and\none of the individual Petitioners is a director of\nthat -- of that professional corporation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What he -- what I think his\nargument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the\ndefinition of \"bankruptcy assistance,\" you will see\nthere are seven different things that a person could do\nand fall within that definition. And all of those seven\nthings are probably provided by the kinds of agencies\nyou see advertised on television, which say: We will\nhelp you with your debts. And they probably aren't\nlawyers.\nAnd, so, if you look at the six of the seven\nthings, it's clear that all of those are provided by\nthose television companies. And the seventh is simply\nadded in, namely the providing legal representation, to\nbe a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies\nactually does something that is legal representation,\neven though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.\nSo he is saying, read the whole paragraph\nand then you will see they are after the companies that\nappear on television and they're not after lawyers. And\nthen he says that's the history of the bill, and so\nforth and so on. Okay.\nNow, that's the argument, and so it isn't --\ncan't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you\ndid.\nMR. JAY: Well, I -- I am happy to respond\nto it in further detail. I think that the -- first, the\nreference to appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf\nof another, that can only refer to lawyers. Even if as\nyou --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, there could\nnot only be lawyers. I mean, there are numerous\nproceedings where your brother, your mother, your\ncousin, your friend appears for you. They say: Bring a\nfriend, bring one of us.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: We will charge you very\nlittle, we will save you money. I am a lawyer, by the\nway.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JAY: That's right, Justice Breyer, and\nI think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have relatives who\naren't, and you can bring one of them.\nMR. JAY: But appearing -- appearing in a\ncase or proceeding under this title, Your Honor, means\nentering an appearance in court. I think that's --\nthat's the natural reading of that phrase. And\nPetitioners have suggested that this is an attempt to\ncatch the unauthorized practice of law. But certainly\nneither the plain meaning nor the legislative record\nsuggests that people who are not lawyers were actually\nengaging in conduct so brazen as to show up in Federal\nBankruptcy Court, enter -- file a notice of appearance\nand purport to be a lawyer. That is not what this\nstatute is intended to catch.\nAt any rate, the legislative history I think\namply supports our view. Page 21 of our brief collects\na number of citations to the legislative record\nspecifically referring to attorneys.\nAs for the point Mr. Brunstad made about the\nchange in the drafting history of this bill from \"debt\nrelief counseling agency\" to \"debt relief agency,\" that\nchange was made in 1999. And in the House report\naccompanying the 1999 version of the bill, which had\nchanged from \"debt relief counseling agency\" to \"debt\nrelief agency,\" the House report said, \"It applies to\nattorneys, as well as to non-attorneys, such as petition\npreparers. That is page 120 of House Report 106-123.\nSo I think that amply refutes the point\nabout the drafting history.\nBut in any event, if the Court were to look\nat legislative history, we think that the provisions of\nthe 2005 House report accompanying the bill that\nactually was enacted are the most probative, and we've\ncited two references on page 21 of our brief that we\nthink amply demonstrate that attorneys are included.\nIf the Court has no further questions about\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if -- if -- if\nlawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your\nlimiting construction works. If a client comes into a\nlawyer and says, look, I know we are thinking of filing\nbankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it;\ncan I do it? And the lawyer says: Oh, the law says I\ncan't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy;\nthe Solicitor General says that means I can't give you\nadvice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of\nassets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.\nMR. JAY: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has that\nperson violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?\nMR. JAY: I don't think so, Your Honor. The\nstatute prohibits only advice to incur more debt in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the person has\nasked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti? And the lawyer,\nalthough giving perfectly truthful advice, has\neffectively conveyed to his client that if he does he\nwould be depriving debtors of assets they might\notherwise get.\nMR. JAY: But the lawyer in your\nhypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, has not advised the\nclient to take the trip; it has not advised the client\nto do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He has communicated\nto the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will\nhave a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using\nassets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the\ndebtors.\nMR. JAY: I suppose that, you know, there\nmight be a fact question about whether a particular wink\nand nod communication between an attorney and client\nwere in fact advice to engage in the transaction, that's\nprohibited under the Bankruptcy Code, the fraudulent or\nabusive transaction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if\nthe lawyer said: I can't give you advice in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief, read that.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And a reasonable --\nmy point is a reasonable person reading the brief would\nsay, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because\nthat might cause me to do something that would defraud\nthe debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.\nMR. JAY: Well, if -- if that debtor reads\nour brief, that debtor will also see that there are\nserious consequences for the debtor himself, which is\nprecisely why Congress passed this statute providing for\nrelief for the debtor against the attorney who provides\nthis unethical or abusive advice.\nAn attorney -- sorry. A client who incurs\nadditional debt intending to defraud the creditor may\nnot be able to obtain a discharge of that debt and\nindeed may not be able to obtain a discharge in\nbankruptcy at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's one of\nthe things I'm concerned about your limiting\nconstruction, \"intending to defraud the debtor.\" What\nif the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November?\nThey've always done it. They are not intending to\ndefraud the debtor. They are just doing what they have\nalways done. So an attorney that gives that advice,\nwould be -- that would be okay?\nMR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nthe Culver case, a -- a disciplinary case that we\nreferred to in our brief, is a good illustration of\nthis. Fraud turns on the defrauder's intent as a -- as\na general matter. And when someone --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if -- so if the\nlawyer said that, I can't give you advice in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that\nfraud turns on the debtor's intent?\nMR. JAY: Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I\n-- I don't think that that would be advice to incur the\nadditional debt. And I don't think that the -- that a\ndebtor who read our brief or who informed himself with\nthese hints that you're positing the attorney giving, I\ndon't think that the debtor would take the step of -- of\nincurring the additional debt, precisely because there\nare consequences for the debtor, and it's -- it's a\ngrave risk. That's precisely why Congress prohibited --\nprohibited this form of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the whole\npoint is that the attorney could be providing advice\nthat would steer the debtor away from doing anything\nwrong. And yet the other -- the government would say,\noh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay\nto take the trip to Tahiti. If he says you can take the\ntrip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud\nthe debtor -- correct advice that could be read as\ntelling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be\nread as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink\nand a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to\ndo? And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation,\nnot to defraud the debtors.\nMR. JAY: I think, Your Honor, subject to\nsome kind of situations of willful blindness, that the\nattorney in that situation would not be read by any\nfactfinder to have advised a -- to have advised her\nclient to incur additional debt in contemplation of\nbankruptcy.\nAnd it is -- it is that that is the\nstatutory touchstone.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take some of\nthe examples that were in the amicus brief. One of them\nwas the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a\nserious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and\nshe is at the end of the line on resources. She has her\ntrade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but\nthen she won't be able to carry on her business. And\nshe could also borrow money, but incurring that debt --\nsince she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's\nincurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of\nbankruptcy.\nCould the lawyer say, you don't have to sell\nyour -- the lawyer could say: Sell your equipment.\nThat wouldn't be a problem. But could the lawyer say,\nincur the debt?\nMR. JAY: I think the lawyer under a number\nof circumstances could say incur the debt. Precisely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, take this\ncircumstance. There is no other -- the person is on a\nbrink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by\nselling assets or by borrowing.\nMR. JAY: Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe hypothetical doesn't state how she's going to borrow\nthe money. So for example, if she has an open home\nequity line of credit and she borrows against that home\nequity line of credit, it's a secured loan that is not\ngoing to be discharged in a Chapter 7 proceeding, I\nthink that that's unobjectionable under our reading of\nthe statute. It's not -- it's not abusive, because it's\nnot an abuse of the bankruptcy system.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose she doesn't have\na home equity loan. Suppose she's a renter?\nMR. JAY: Well, the two -- the two scenarios\nthat our view -- that in our view are covered by the\nstatute are taking on debt in an attempt to abuse the\nbankruptcy system or to defraud the creditor. And even\n-- even someone without -- without a home equity loan, a\nhome equity line of credit, can take on additional debt\nwithout intending to defraud the creditor simply by --\nby intending to repay it.\nAnd that is illustrated in the Culver case,\nin which the attorney had advised the client to take on\nadditional debt, to -- indeed, he gave her a credit card\napplication and said, get some more cash advances. And\nshe said: I don't want to take on this additional debt.\nAnd he said: Don't worry, I will represent you in\nbankruptcy; you won't have to repay a penny of it. And\nthe Court of Appeals of Maryland explained that that was\nunethical advice under the Rule 1.2(d), the model rule\nthat applies in just about every jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can come up with\nyour own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your\npoint of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting\nsome that are much more difficult because they depend on\nparticular facts. And under your construction it seems\nto me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal,\nethical advice has got to pause before every sentence\nand think, oh, is this going to be construed in\nviolation of subsection (a)(4)?\nMR. JAY: I don't think so, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and I'm certainly not attempting to fight\nJustice Ginsburg's hypothetical. I'm attempting to\nillustrate that -- that the aspect of the statute that\nprohibits advice to defraud creditors, you know, will\nturn on, among other things, whether there is any intent\nto repay the debt.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't something in\ncontemplation of bankruptcy done only -- isn't something\ndone in contemplation of bankruptcy only if it is done\nbecause of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy\npetition? So that if -- if a person takes on additional\ndebt in order to obtain life-saving treatment, that is\nnot done in contemplation of bankruptcy; it's not done\nbecause of the bankruptcy. It's done because there is\nan emergency that requires immediate expenditures.\nMR. JAY: I think that that's right, Justice\nAlito, that in that hypothetical there is no -- the mere\n-- the mere fact that the bankruptcy may be looming,\neven in the hypothetical, is not the animating cause.\nAnd the Court has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If indeed \"in contemplation\nof bankruptcy\" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to\nbe for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code --\nright? If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness\narguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal\nanyway, wouldn't it?\nMR. JAY: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So even without this\nstatute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about\nwhether he's doing something that is unlawful.\nMR. JAY: The two prongs of -- of our\nreading of the statute, that's right, Justice Scalia,\nare to abuse the Bankruptcy Code or to -- or to defraud\ncreditors. The fraud of course is illegal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is you\ndon't know. Of course you can't give advice to do\nsomething illegal. But I -- I would think that some of\nthe questions have been suggesting that it's hard to\nknow whether it's illegal. You yourself say it depends\non the debtor's intent. So if a client came in to me\nand said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent,\nas a lawyer I would want to say: It depends on why you\nare doing it. But if -- but that I think could be\nconstrued as being -- giving advice in contemplation of\nbankruptcy.\nMR. JAY: But precisely because, Mr. Chief\nJustice, the definition of fraud turns on the defendant\nor the fraudulent actor's intent, that's true under\npresent law, under Rule 1.2(d) which prohibits all\nattorneys from counseling their clients to commit\nfraudulent acts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The lawyer runs that risk\nanyway, whether this statute applies or not. He has --\nhe has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on\ncreditors.\nMR. JAY: Or an abuse of the Bankruptcy\nCode. And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out in\nMr. Brunstad's argument, that is something that the\nattorney already must be familiar with under Section\n707(b) and must certify in filing any Chapter 7\nbankruptcy that in -- after the attorney's professional\ninvestigation, that the granting of relief would not be\nan abuse of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nAttorneys are -- are making that\ncertification every day when they are filing for Chapter\n7 bankruptcies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a regulation\nof the attorney-client relationship to pursue an\nunrelated substantive objective. You want to ensure\nthat debtors don't do something and you think, well, the\nway -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this.\nYou're going to say: We are going to regulate what\nlawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated\nobjective.\nMR. JAY: I don't think it's unrelated,\nMr. Chief Justice. The objective is in many -- in some\ninstances criminal and in other instances it is\nprohibited by the Bankruptcy Code. And the reason\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the objective\nis criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being\nindirectly enforced by interfering with the\nattorney-client relationship.\nMR. JAY: Well, it is certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- or affecting the\nattorney-client relationship.\nMR. JAY: It is certainly true,\nMr. Chief Justice, that the attorney is the\nsophisticated player here. It is the attorney who is\nthe repeat player, and it is the attorney who, by being\nmade subject to this statute, is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, it's a good way\nto enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice\nabout it.\nWhat if a State thinks that there are too\nmany punitive damage awards, that they are out of\ncontrol, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not\ntell their clients that they can get -- they can seek\npunitive damages?\nMR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, seeking\npunitive damages is not illegal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, if it's done\nwith the purpose of fraud, it is. If you think, well,\nI'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't\nmalicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard\nis for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like\nhere if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's\nillegal, but if you don't it's not.\nMR. JAY: Well, I think that the restriction\nthat you're positing is that advice ever to seek\npunitive damages is -- is going to be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no, no.\nOnly if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that\nadvice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.\nMR. JAY: Well, no. That would, of course,\nwould be outside the bankruptcy context, and we are\nrelying in part here on -- both on the avoidance\ndoctrine and on the meaning that \"in contemplation of\nbankruptcy\" has had for a long time.\nBut -- but to answer your question, I think\nthat, if there is actually a tie between -- so that\nsounds exactly to me like a prohibition saying to the\nlawyer, don't file complaints for punitive damages that\naren't supported just under the normal Rule 11 evidence\nstandard. And I don't think that that is an\nimpermissible attempt to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. It's a\ndifference between filing, because there the lawyer\nsigns the -- signs the complaint. It's giving advice to\nthe client.\nAnd the -- I guess what I would see as the\nparallel is that it's an objective outside the\nattorney-client relationship. It's not like saying, you\ncan't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or --\nor whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the\nclient -- protect the client.\nIt's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.\nMR. JAY: Well, here, I don't think -- I\ndon't think it's an extraneous objective. Perhaps I am\nmisunderstanding how you -- how the Court is meaning\nextraneous.\nThe -- here, the advice is the motivating\ncause in some of these instances of the -- of the debtor\ntaking the step that's going to lead to actual harm to\nthe debtor.\nThat's why Congress provided that the remedy\nfor a violation of this is either an injunctive action\nby a government official, the U.S. trustee or by the\nCourt or State attorney general, or actual damages paid\nto the debtor who has suffered harm from the unethical\nor abuse of advice given to him or her by the attorney.\nSo I think that saying that -- that it's\nextraneous to the attorney-client relationship, I think\nthat's not the statute that -- that Congress enacted\nhere.\nIt enacted a statute that protects the\nclient from improper, unethical, abusive, or even\ncriminal -- criminally fraudulent advice by the\nattorney.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One thing that lawyers\nwho render services for money want -- is to be sure that\nthey will get paid, and one part of this provision, this\n526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney\nfor representing the debtor.\nSo what can a lawyer say safely about the\nlawyer's getting paid?\nMR. JAY: Well, I would like to note, if I\nmay, Justice Ginsburg, that we don't think that that is\nproperly part of this challenge. I will be happy -- I\nwill be happy to answer the question, but the court of\nappeals struck down this statute, and it said, nine\ntimes, that it was talking about the portion of the\nstatute referring to in contemplation of bankruptcy.\nAnd the to pay an attorney provision was not\naddressed in the Petitioner's brief in the court of\nappeals or in their brief in opposition to our cert\nposition, so we don't -- we don't think it's properly\nhere -- it hasn't been addressed.\nBut to -- to answer your question, the\nstatute says not -- and this part of the statute is on\npage 5a of the appendix to our brief -- \"to advise an\nassisted person to incur more debt to pay an attorney or\nbankruptcy petition preparer.\"\nSo advising the client -- you know, that the\nclient ought to pay the fee -- you know, here's my bill,\nmy fee is due on day X, that simply doesn't come within\nthe terms of the statute. It's only to incur more debt\nto pay the attorney.\nAnd the situation that we think Congress is\ngetting at is the circumstance where the attorney wants\nto be paid up-front, again, like in the Culver case, the\nattorney wants his client to take out a cash advance\nfrom the credit card company, knowing -- and to give\nthat money to the attorney to pay his fee, precisely\nbecause the debt's going to be -- the unsecured debt to\nthe credit card company is going to be discharged in\nbankruptcy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's the\nclear case. How about the person comes in, shows the\nattorney his or her financial state. There is no money\nto pay the fee. The attorney simply gives a bill and\nsays, \"I need it by Friday.\"\nNo self-respecting person would believe that\nthe individual is going to pay that bill without\nborrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at\ntheir financial statement and there is no money to be\nhad. Would the attorney have violated the statute\nthere?\nMR. JAY: I don't think so, Justice\nSotomayor, precisely because the attorney -- the\nattorney still hasn't issued the advice to incur more\ndebt. I mean, the client, of course, also has the\nopportunity -- or the option of not paying the fee and\ncarrying it -- carrying it forward into bankruptcy.\nSo, in any event, we don't think that that\nprovision can -- can be the basis for a holding that the\nother provision about in contemplation of bankruptcy is\nsubstantially overbroad, which is what the court of\nappeals held here.\nIf I may, unless the Court has further\nquestions on --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just one. So,\nbasically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt\nto pay an attorney is illegal?\nMR. JAY: To incur more debt to pay an\nattorney, I think -- I think that is the import of the\nstatute, and that's because Congress recognized that\nthere is an incentive for attorneys to put pressure on\ntheir clients to -- to favor the attorney as creditor,\nto, essentially, treat the attorney as a creditor in a\nbetter position than other creditors.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Perhaps I am being --\nnot quite understanding you. You are underscoring the\nmore debt, that is going to always be additional, if the\nadvice is to incur it. So what meaning are you giving\nto more that I am missing?\nMR. JAY: Well, in some of the examples that\nhave come up in the briefing in this case -- you know, a\nrefinancing transaction, for example -- you know, or a\nsale -- sale of the house and replacing it with a\nrental. We don't think that that is more debt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't how this works\nexactly. I'm not an expert. I thought that, when\nsomeone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask\nthe bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for\nongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's\nfee. Otherwise, people could never be represented.\nMR. JAY: It's true that the court can\nauthorize --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, so why is there some\nincentive here? All the attorney has to do is follow\nordinary procedure.\nMR. JAY: Precisely because, Justice Breyer,\ndifferent standards apply to the -- to payments made to\nthe attorney before the bankruptcy commences and\npayments made to the attorney after the bankruptcy\ncommences.\nIt's a -- the standard of scrutiny after the\nbankruptcy commences is a -- is a bit more searching\nunder Section 330.\nIf the Court has no further questions on\nSection 526, I do want to address Section 528, the --\nthe advertising disclosure requirements. And, there, we\nthink that, as Justice Sotomayor brought out in her\nexchange with Mr. Brunstad, there is no evidence in this\ncase pertaining to the particular advertisements that\npetitioners want to run.\nThey simply say, on pages 38 and 39 of the\njoint appendix, that they have advertised, and they wish\nto continue to advertise. There is no allegation about\ntheir content. And they sought and were granted summary\njudgment in the district court on the theory that this\nstatute is unconstitutional.\nAnd so to the extent that it's anything\nother than a facial challenge, it's an as-applied\nchallenge, as applied, essentially, to any attorney or,\nindeed, anyone who wants to run these advertisements.\nWe think that, as I understand the gravamen\nof Petitioners' argument, is that the two-sentence\nsuggested text is incorrect, that it's -- that it's\nmisleading because it's wrong.\nAnd the basis for that is saying that some\npeople who are debt relief agencies don't help people\nfile for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.\nThat is not correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it misleading for\nan attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency?\nNobody is going to know what a debt relief agency is,\nunless they are familiar with this statute.\nMR. JAY: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: A perspective client looks\nat that, and they say, well, I don't want a debt relief\nagency, I want a lawyer.\nMR. JAY: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's misleading.\nMR. JAY: Four points on that, Justice\nAlito.\nFirst, the advertisement can and indeed, I'm\nsure always will, say that the advertiser is a lawyer.\nNothing forbids the advertisement from saying that.\nThere is no restriction on what content goes in the ad,\nonly that it include this is disclaimer.\nSecond, the term \"debt relief agency\" is a\nnew one. It was coined by Congress in 2005 precisely\nbecause it includes -- it includes attorneys; it\nincludes bankruptcy petition preparers. They had to --\nyou know, they had to come up with an amalgamated term\nthat includes them both. The fact that it's a new term\n-- it came freighted with no -- no preceding -- no\nbaggage from its preceding history, and indeed, if the\nstatute were on the books and allowed to take affect\nonce this challenge is disposed of, I am confident that\nthe meaning would become much more well-accepted.\nAnd the Petitioners have invited the Court,\nand this is on page 87 of their opening brief, to look\nat their website. And of course that's outside the\nrecord, but to the extent that the Court looks at it,\nthe Court will see that Petitioners refer to their\nbankruptcy practice as providing debt relief. We think\nthat's a natural way of -- of pitching what the services\nmade available by a bankruptcy attorney are: Relief\nfrom one's debts. So we don't think there is anything\nwrong with that term.\nBut I do want to turn back to why it's not\ncorrect to say that a debt relief agency would ever not\n-- not help people file for bankruptcy relief under the\nBankruptcy Code. That is because, as I understand\nPetitioners' argument, it's that an assisted person\nmight be a creditor. That is not correct.\nThe definition of \"assisted person\" turns on\nhaving nonexempt property in excess of a certain amount.\nUnder section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code, and indeed\nunder this Court's decision in Owen v. Owen, there is no\nexempt property until there is a filing for bankruptcy\nand an assembly of the bankruptcy estate and a filing by\nthe debtor, or someone on the debtor's behalf, filing\nschedules that specify what property the debtor has and\nwhich exemptions the debtor chooses to claim. That is\nonly done when there is a debtor. Creditors don't do\nthat. Creditors don't have nonexempt property. We\ndon't think a creditor could be an assisted person.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about a law firm\nthat represents the biggest companies in the world? And\nso they are never going to consciously, intentionally\nseek out or represent a person defined with the\nfinancial limitations of this category. But it so\nhappens that one of their very rich clients comes in and\nsays, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a\nsmall business; help him or her.\nIs that firm in violation now because their\nadvertisements did not include what 528(a) required?\nMR. JAY: Well, first, Justice Sotomayor,\nif, for example, they do it pro bono, then it wouldn't\n-- then it wouldn't trigger the definition at all. But\nassuming that the brother-in-law pays for the services,\nthen yes. I mean, yes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they have to -- for\nthis one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're\nnow violated the statute ex post facto somehow?\nMR. JAY: Not ex post facto, Justice\nSotomayor. They would become a debt relief agency, and\nthereafter, advertisements directed to the public that\nadvertise those specific services, and if they don't\nhave a bankruptcy practice at all, or don't advertise\nthe services that are listed in section 528, then the\ndisclaimer requirement doesn't apply at all. But if\nthey then chose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they're -- if they're,\nas the hypothetical suggests, representing only big\ncompanies, they're probably not advertising to the\ngeneral public anyway.\nMR. JAY: That -- that may well be. Well,\nthey may have a website, Justice Scalia, but big firms\nhave to deal already with multifarious disclaimer\nrequirements in every State where they practice, and\nfirm websites often have a lengthy set of disclaimers;\nyou know, one required by Texas, and one required by New\nYork, and so on. This is something that -- that\nmultijurisdictional firms are already familiar with, and\nthey provide these disclaimers without problem. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that one of the\naspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are\nnot limited to saying, \"We are debt relief agencies; we\nhelp people file for bankruptcy.\" They can say anything\nelse. But there's no screening -- there is no\nadministrator that a law firm can go to and say, \"This\nis what I think is substantially similar. Is it okay?\"\nMR. JAY: That is true, Justice Ginsburg,\nand there is of course the safe harbor. By using this\ntwo-sentence statement, the advertiser is certain that\nthere will be no problem.\nBut I think that -- that a substantially --\na substantially similar statement is a permissive\nstandard, and if there would be any constitutional\ndoubt, it would be to resolve it in flexibility in that\nregard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Brunstad, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &\nMILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Thank you.\nJustice Ginsburg, your example about the\nwoman who is in need of medical attention falls squarely\nwithin the statute. The lawyer would be prohibited from\nadvising her to incur debt to get needed medical\nattention, and the government, in trying to articulate a\nway around that during the course of the argument,\narticulated no less than five different standards.\nThe conduct would have to be fraudulent or\nunethical or abusive or criminal or improper. None of\nthose are in the statute, and it's impossible to know\nwhich one. Chief Justice Roberts, you are absolutely\nright: What this statute does is it's basically trying\nto interfere with the attorney-client relationship, and\neven moreso on the side of \"or pay an attorney. \"\nAnd Justice Breyer, here's how it works.\nThe client comes to -- the prospective client comes to\nthe lawyer and is in trouble. And may not know whether\nthe client has to file for bankruptcy or not. So there\nis a conversation that happens. And in that\nconversation, it may be decided that the best thing for\nthe client to do is to file for bankruptcy, and of\ncourse, the client will have to know: How am I going to\npay for this?\nWell, there are two ways. One, the client\ncan pay the attorney in full, up front, or the attorney\ncan take payment over time. However, this all happens\nbefore bankruptcy, so there is no involvement of the\nCourt at this point. If the attorney accepts payment\nover time, which many do, because it's very expensive to\nfile for bankruptcy now and most debtors don't have the\nwherewithal, the attorney, by saying, I take payment\nover time, and the debtor accepting that, the debtor\nwould be incurring debt in contemplation of bankruptcy.\nIncurring debt to the attorney. The attorney would be\nproscribed, under the statute, from actually giving that\nparticular advice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What the attorney says is,\nHere's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I\nwill ask the Court to approve my own fees as something\nthat is continuing after bankruptcy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And he says, This is what\nthey will be.\nSo what is the harm --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because you can't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- since that's what he has\nto do, of making him tell his client that that's what he\nhas to do?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because you can't advise the\nclient in advance to incur that debt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you -- you can't? This\nprevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is\nask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, that has to happen\nanyway under section --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course. And so what's\nwrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he\nhas to tell the client?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because there, in that\nsituation, you would be advising the client to incur the\ndebt. In other words, be advising the client to incur\nthe debt, not the actual incurrence of the debt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't read the\nhypothetical that you have given as coming within the\nstatute. I think what -- what it means: Incurred debt\nto pay an attorney, I don't think it means debt to the\nattorney. You are not worried about the attorney\ncheating himself.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, except debt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Making himself an\nadditional creditor. That's ridiculous.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But debt is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What it talks about is\ninducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody\nelse to pay the attorney. You know, and that seems to\nbe perfectly reasonable.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I think it includes both,\nJustice Scalia. For example, you couldn't advises your\nclient to borrow $1,000 from your mother.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And you couldn't -- and you\nalso, I think, advise a client to basically borrow money\nfrom you, the attorney. You're extending services on\ncredit; that's incurring a debt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would you worry\nabout the attorney, you know, hurting himself?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It makes no sense.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It's at least unclear,\nJustice Scalia, and that is the heart of the problem.\nIt's very unclear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
