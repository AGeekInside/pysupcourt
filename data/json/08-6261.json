        "content": "(11:16 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-6261, Robertson v. United\nStates, ex rel. Watson.\nMs. Frankfurt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JACLYN S. FRANKFURT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. FRANKFURT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case presents the question whether,\nunder our Constitution, the power to prosecute criminal\ncontempt in a Federal court rests solely with the\nsovereign. The United States now agrees that the fact\nthat a criminal offense may only be prosecuted by the\nsovereign is a foundational premise of our Constitution.\nBecause Mr. Robertson was prosecuted for criminal\ncontempt in a private right of action, his prosecution\nwas unconstitutional, a nullity in our view, and his\nconvictions must be vacated.\nMs. Watson defends the lower court's ruling\nthat -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. He didn't make\nthat argument, though. I mean, his -- as I recall, his\nonly complaint was that he had been promised that -\nthat he wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be prosecuted. And\nthat was his only complaint below, wasn't it?\nMS. FRANKFURT: His complaint below was that\nhe had a plea agreement with the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. FRANKFURT: And that the only lawful or\nconstitutional way he could have been prosecuted was in\nan action brought by the United States; that the local\nstatute didn't authorize a private right of action, and\nthat the Constitution could not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He made the constitutional\nclaim below?\nMS. FRANKFURT: He said below that -- that a\nprivate right of action was neither lawful under the\nlocal statutes nor constitutional, and the parties\nresponded that it was; and the lower court held it is\nauthorized by local statute; it's constitutional; in\nfact, this was a private right of action prosecuted by\nMs. Watson on her own behalf and therefore your plea\nagreement fails.\nWe have never argued, if it was actually her\nprosecuting, that -- that she was bound by the plea\nagreement. We argued it can't be her prosecuting, it\ncan't be under the Constitution, it can't be under the\nlocal statute. And if it's the United States, then we\nare entitled to the benefit of the plea agreement we had\nwith the United States.\nThe -- Ms. Watson defends the lower court\nruling that a private right of criminal action is\nconstitutional, but really has mounted -- excuse me -\nmounted very little attack on our constitutional\nargument that the Constitution contemplates that crimes\nare public wrongs brought on behalf of sovereigns.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. We have\nplenty of plea agreements jurisprudence that say if the\nSouthern District of New York prosecutes someone and\nthey sign a plea agreement and say, we're not going to\nprosecute you for further crimes, we read that to mean\nthat the Southern District of New York won't prosecute\nyou for further crimes. We don't read it that no other\ngovernment agency is bound, who has jurisdiction over\nthat criminal activity, that they are equally bound.\nSo why isn't this case the same?\nAssuming -- that you're making a broad statement, that\nthis has to be brought in the name of the government.\nAssuming that's correct, does that mean that -- why does\nthat mean that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the\nAttorney General's Office, which appear to be two\ndifferent entities enforcing two different sets of law,\nwhy would both be bound?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Well, it's important to\nclarify, because there is -- there is a lack of -- it is\nnot parallel to the Federal system. So even assuming -\nand I believe there is a circuit -- that the Second\nCircuit says when the Southern District signs it's the\nSouthern District only, and the Third, Fourth, Eighth,\nand Ninth view it differently when something reads as\nbroadly as this, which is the government. In the\nDistrict of Columbia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. It's not just\nthe Southern District; it's also what, the State?\nMS. FRANKFURT: No. No, I believe in the\nSecond Circuit they might read something signed by the\nSouthern District as not binding in the Eastern\nDistrict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got you.\nMS. FRANKFURT: But in the District of\nColumbia, only the United States Attorney prosecutes\ncriminal offenses of the type that occurred here. There\nis a bit of a red herring here from this plea form.\nThis is a plea form that is used in Superior Court both\nin traffic offenses, which are the type of offenses that\nthe District of Columbia prosecutes, and in criminal\noffenses.\nAnd the cross-outs are just to conform the\nplea form, so that if you cross out \"D.C.\" it reads\n\"United States v. John Robertson,\" which is how -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That did puzzle me. I was\nwondering if there's -- if there's coordinate\njurisdiction. Can the -- can the District prosecute for\ncrimes that the Attorney General can prosecute for?\nMS. FRANKFURT: There is -- there is not\ncoordinate jurisdiction. There is some -- some\nprovisions for consent if there are multiple offenses\nand one goes to one, one goes to the other.\nBut all the offenses we're talking about\nhere are United States offenses. It was the United\nStates's position below that only the United States\nprosecutes contempt. It was actually the Attorney\nGeneral's conviction in the lower court that it could\nnot, representing the District of Columbia, prosecute\ncontempt.\nSo that if we are construing the party to be\nthe United States as the Solicitor General now asks -\nyou know, Young and Providence Journal really apply,\nwhich is then the prosecuting entity is the United\nStates, whether represented by a private prosecutor or\nby a United States attorney. That's a very different\nsituation than different offices or -- because the\nDistrict of Columbia could not be prosecuting this case\nrepresenting the -- the Attorney General couldn't be\nprosecuting this case representing the District of\nColumbia government. That's not in the picture as an\noption.\nThe -- the case -- if it's\nprosecuted by a sovereign, it's prosecuted by the United\nStates, and the only argument that the Solicitor General\nis now making is that that wouldn't bind if private\nprosecutor representing the United States, as happened\nin Young. We have a local case that says when a private\nprosecutor in a criminal contempt case signs the plea\nagreement on behalf of the United States, it's a binding\nplea agreement and binds the -- the United States.\nSo the cross-out on the plea form, I\nbelieve, are a bit of a red herring. The cross-out on\nthe caption just makes it read United States v. John\nRobertson in a felony, which is the only way felonies\ncan be prosecuted. The cross-out on the signature line\njust makes it read the United States Attorney, who is\nthe only one who can sign such a form in a felony case.\nAnd it doesn't define a particular prosecuting entity\nbetween Federal and State, or between two different\nFederal jurisdictions that have concurrent jurisdiction\nover, let's say, mail fraud or something like that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this law unique to the\nDistrict or do other States -- I mean, the problem that\nthey are trying to get a handle on is domestic violence.\nAnd the prosecutors are busy prosecuting drug crimes and\nthe rest. So the District's solution is, we will allow\nthe abused person to initiate this criminal contempt.\nAre there other States that have the same procedure?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I -- the -- the same\nprocedure is a question of how that is defined. If the\nquestion is whether there are other States that have a\nwholly private right of action where the person is\nconstrued as bringing it on her own behalf, not on\nbehalf of a sovereign, in a criminal case, we have seen\nnothing -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I mean, however you\ndescribe it in practical terms, are there other places\nthat say, abused person, you can initiate this and you\ncan have your lawyer present it, whether it's on behalf\nof the State or -- but just the practical of how you go\nthrough the motions; are there other States that allow\nthe victim?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes, there are other -\nthere are other States that allow the complainant to\neither bring it to the attention of the court in the\nform of a request for an order to show cause and to\nactually prosecute as a private prosecutor, the way,\nlet's say, in Young, they would have characterized a\nprivate prosecutor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In criminal cases, because\nI -- I -- correct me if I am wrong, but my -- my\nrecollection is that orders to show cause for contempt\nin the civil -- on the civil side occur frequently, and\nthat allows a jail sentence in California I think of 5\ndays -- and this is civil, because it's coercive. Now,\nyou are talking about something different, I take it?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I am. I am talking about\ncriminal contempt. For instance, in the District of\nColumbia before this case came down there -- we had an\nopinion, based on a local legislature's determination,\nthat said a beneficiary of a civil protection order may\ninitiate a criminal contempt proceeding and may act as\nprivate prosecutor the way in -- in Young this Court\nsaid as a matter of supervisory authorities they didn't\nwant interested parties.\nThere are jurisdictions, I believe, that\nallow for interested parties to take that role. But the\nrole is the role of the lawyer on behalf of the\nsovereign -- sovereign, whichever sovereign it is, who\nis the ultimate party -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course -\nMS. FRANKFURT -- and who can nolle the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the States don't have\nthe same compulsion that the Federal Government has,\nwhich arises from the separation of powers. And -\nwhich -- which means that it is the executive that has\nthe right to prosecute, and States are not bound by such\na thing. And they can perhaps allow private individuals\nto prosecute, whereas the only exception we have made\nfrom the -- from the chief executive's authority to\nprosecute is Young, which is a very narrow exception,\ndealing with the Court's ability to protect itself from\ncontempt of its orders.\nAnd here the court had nothing to do with\nthe appointment of this private party, right?\nMS. FRANKFURT: That's absolutely true. In\nour view to the extent there are any sort of exceptions\nfrom procedural rights or the normal process in contempt\nproceedings, they are narrowly tailored and governed by\nthe doctrine of necessity. And that -- and so while\nRespondent's counsel indicates, well, there are a lot of\ndifferences in contempt and just add one to this list,\nthey make no attempt to ground that in the document of\nnecessity, which is really the only thing that -- that\njustifies any sort of procedural difference in the\ncontempt context.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I right that the\nDistrict has been following this procedure for quite\nsome time?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes. Well, I guess it\ndepends on what the question what \"this procedure\" is.\nThe District -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, where a private\nparty initiates, the beneficiary of an order of this\nkind, initiates a contempt proceeding against a person\nwho violates it, and seeks a punishment for it, not just\ndiscontinuance.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes. The -- the District\nhad a case where it said it believed itself not bound by\nthe supervisory authority of Young and it would allow\ninterested parties to prosecute contempt in the domestic\nviolence context only, not outside the domestic violence\ncontext. And it has had cases prosecuted in that\nfashion since that time, which I believe was 1984. But\nit has -- it was not until this case that the issue\narose because of the plea agreement to suggest that that\nperson was prosecuting in her own name -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't say to me that\nthe plea agreement goes to the question of whether there\nis sort of an inherent violation of the Constitution by\nadopting this procedure at all.\nMS. FRANKFURT: I -- I -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have trouble figuring\nout whether the plea agreement has any relevance to the\nkind of basic argument you are making.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Well, we actually see two\narguments, and maybe that's -- that we are making, which\nmay be part of the confusion.\nIf this proceeding really was, as the lower\ncourt interpreted, the lower court -- the lower court\ninterpreted the local statute and what occurred and\nsaid: This really was a private right of action brought\nby Ms. Watson on her own behalf; no government party\ninitiated it, controlled it; and we believe that is\nconstitutional. That's what the lower court said. If\nthat's what occurred, then we believe this Court could\nwell say that is unconstitutional.\nWe -- we defer to the lower court's view of\nwhat occurred pursuant to the local statute. This was a\nprivate right of action, the lower court told us so, and\nwe don't think that the Constitution can tolerate such a\nthing. And, therefore, like in Gompers where criminal\npenalty was imposed, Gompers v. Buck's Stove, a criminal\npenalty was imposed in an action between private\nparties, that judgment must be set aside. She never had\npower to invoke the authority of the court in the first\nplace. That's one way to view it. The Solicitor\nGeneral -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or just to say the lower\ncourt was wrong -\nMS. FRANKFURT: The lower court was wrong.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- on that premise.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have another option,\nonce we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it\nback and let them look at the second question, which is\nwhether or not a private party can bring an action in\nthe name of the sovereign.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Well, I think that the\nsecond way to view it, as -- as I was going to say, is\nwhat the Solicitor General of the United States now\nagrees -- they thought below that it was Constitution,\nbut they now agree that the Constitution cannot tolerate\nprivate criminal rights of action.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if -- if that's true,\nthey have been following an unconstitutional practice\nfor about 25 years; is that right?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I believe -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And nobody thought about\nit in all this time?\nMS. FRANKFURT: And certainly since, you\nknow, since they made the argument to the lower courts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because it is done many,\nmany times, as I understand it, over the years.\nMS. FRANKFURT: It was done many times,\nreceived -- when the original -- when the interested\nprosecutor decision was made, it was made on the same\nfoundational premise as Young, which was let's look and\nsee if we are concerned about conflict of interest.\nBy the nature of asking, the court asking\nquestions of conflict of interest, the court was\nthinking of the woman as representing the government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This wouldn't be allowed\nunder Young. I mean, if Young made anything clear is\nyou couldn't appoint as a prosecutor an interested\nparty. And here is the most the interested party of\nall.\nMS. FRANKFURT: That's true. It certainly\nwould not be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So don't -- don't -- don't\nsay that Young would have allowed it.\nMS. FRANKFURT: No, no, no, no. It\ncertainly wouldn't be allowed under Young. But to\nfinish my -- my answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice\nStevens as to the second route: If this Court -- what\nthe Solicitor General I believe is asking this Court to\ndo is to say it's not constitutional to have such an\naction brought on behalf of a private party, therefore,\nconstrue it as an action brought on behalf of the\nsovereign.\nThis Court -- if this Court goes that route,\nas opposed to deferring to the way the lower court\ndescribed it, rather says this must have been on behalf\nof the sovereign, the sovereign was the United States,\nthen the question is whether the plea agreement barred\nit.\nThe lower court said the plea agreement\ndidn't bar it because it was Ms. Watson's; obviously it\ndidn't bar it. Ms. Watson is not the United States.\nBut if in fact it was on behalf of the United States,\nthen the question is does the plea agreement bar it. We\nthink that the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does -- does the Justice\nDepartment concede that the sovereign here is the United\nStates? Does the Justice Department concede -\nMS. FRANKFURT: I believe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that there can't be a\nseparate prosecutor from -- from the Assistant United\nStates Attorney and that is the prosecutor for the\nDistrict of Columbia?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I -- I don't want to speak\nfor the Justice Department, but I do believe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't understand them\nto be saying that?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I do believe that they -\nthat they concede that the -- the relevant sovereign is\nthe United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we can ask the\ngovernment.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes. And -\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FRANKFURT: But -- but I believe that's\nwhat their brief said. They certainly said that below\nand I believe that's what they are saying here because\nthey are saying it's prosecution on behalf of the United\nStates. They have given section 518 permission in this\ncase because they believe that the United States is\ninterested.\nAnd so the District of Columbia's role,\noddly enough, all the way through this proceeding and\nthen they withdrew at the merits stage in this Court,\nwas they believed themselves representing the\nPetitioner. They had never perceived themselves to be a\npublic prosecutor. And they in fact said in the lower\ncourt that they had no authority to prosecute contempt\nin the District of Columbia. We agree with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have -- have we had cases\nthat said that Federal separation of powers principles\nare binding on territorial governments, for instance?\nMS. FRANKFURT: You know, I -- I think that\nthe question is -- I don't think -- I disagree with the\ngovernment, with Respondents that this Court has said it\nhasn't. I think in -- I think Springer appears to apply\nseparation of powers principles. I think that\nMetropolitan Airport Authority used Springer in a\nseparation of powers -- a constitutional separation of\npowers analysis. I think even if this Court looks at\nWhalen, which involves D.C., we will see a separation of\npowers analysis applicable to the District of Columbia.\nOur -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the District a\nterritory?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I don't think we are a\nterritory, no. No, it is Article I power that is being\nexercised. Our focus hasn't been entirely separation of\npowers, because in our view, you know, separation of\npowers is about the division of powers within\ngovernment. Here the problem was that the problem was\nthat the -- there is no authority under the Constitution\nto give the power to prosecute time, which has\nhistorically, way back, been an attribute of sovereignty\nand to take it entirely away from the sovereign at all.\nWhich is what -- what the lower court\nfinding was and what Ms. Watson now defends. But we see\na long, long history in the common law, in the English\ncommon law, in our common law, and in our constitutional\njurisprudence of criminal actions being public wrongs\nprosecuted acting on behalf of the sovereign and\ncriminal contempt falling right within that even more\nso, because this is indication of public authority, and\nto the extent there are any deviations from due process\nor separation of powers principles, they are justified\nonly by the doctrine of necessity.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nwill reserve my -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could I -- I have this\nquestion. This -- again, I'm trying to see the case in\nthe broad -- in the broader sense.\nSupposing there is a civil lawsuit that's\nsettled and part of the settlement is a consent decree\nthat would enjoin certain conduct, and the defendant\nthen violates the decree and engages in the prohibited\nconduct. Are you saying that the only person who could\nprosecute for contempt would be the sovereign?\nMS. FRANKFURT: For criminal contempt?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes. Now whether -- whether\nin some situations a private prosecutor could be\nappointed -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, no, the question would\nbe whether the lawyer for the -- the party who entered\ninto the settlement could bring a contempt proceeding\nagainst the adversary who had violated the settlement.\nMS. FRANKFURT: On their own behalf? I\ndon't -- I don't believe so. Not a criminal contempt\nproceeding.\nWe are drawing a fairly rigid distinction\nbetween who the lawyer is and who the lawyer represents.\nIn our view, the party in a criminal action has to be\nthe sovereign, the United States.\nNow in the contempt context there is a\nlimited exception for appointment of private prosecutors\nwhen the executive is declining to prosecute and the\njudiciary needs to vindicate its authority, and if it's\nreferred to the public prosecutor in the Young situation\nand the public prosecutor has declined but the judiciary\nstill needs to vindicate its authority, it can appoint a\nprivate attorney to represent the sovereign.\nBut at root it's the sovereign that is\nprosecuting, no matter who the lawyer is who is standing\nin the courtroom. And the problem in this case was the\nholding of the lower court that said -- that Ms.\nWatson -- it was her case. The prosecutor said it was\nher case; the lawyer said I can't control her; she gets\nto make all the decisions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think the best\nauthority from this Court for your basic proposition is?\nWhat is your strongest case?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I think the strongest case\nis Gompers v. Buck's Stove. That says fundamentally -\nand I'm not quoting verbatim -- but it says\nfundamentally erroneous as if a tort action of A -- for\nbattery of A versus B, a sentence of 12 months is\nimposed. Well, that's exactly what we have here, is we\nhave a sentence of 12 months imposed for an action that\nour lower court said was solely between private parties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think Gompers is the\nbest case?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes, I do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is your position\nand can you advise us -- I know it's not in your case -\nif there is a plea bargain in the Southern District of\nNew York, does it -- does bind, do you think, the\nprosecutor in the Eastern District? What is your view\nof that proposition? I know it's not part of this case.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Right. My view is this\nCourt should go with the Third and Fourth Circuits who\nhave -- expressed -- quite eloquently about the United\nStates not being a bunch of separate fiefdoms, but that\nwhen the United States speaks, they speak for the\ngovernment at large. That is different than a case -\nof some of the cases that were cited, where it says the\nUnited States will make a recommendation to the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service, and then the\ncriminal defendant comes back and says well, the INS is\ndown, too.\nAnd people looks at the agreement and say\nwell, no one would have read that to mean that the\nUnited States included INS, because they were talking\nabout a recommendation to INS.\nBut when the government has written in, my\nview is that -- that the Third Circuit and the Fourth\nCircuit speak eloquently to that. But I don't see that\nthat issue is presented here, given the context on which\nit arises in D.C. where this is conduct that should only\nbe prosecuted in D.C. court by the United States. It\nwas going to be the United States Attorney or a private\nprosecutor representing the United States. We have\nlocal law that says private prosecutors do sign plea\nagreements by the United States and I would think the\nconverse would be true.\nI'll reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think it's very important to be clear\nabout what is properly before the Court. This started\nout as a case about a plea agreement, and the\nPetitioner's claim is that his plea agreement with the\nU.S. Attorney barred his criminal contempt proceeding.\nHe has not made the claim that a private interested\nparty may not bring a criminal contempt proceeding. He\nhas said -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the\nargument is that because a private interested party\ncan't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of\nthe United States and his plea agreement therefore is\nwith the United States.\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean if I could,\nMr. Chief Justice, there are I think several questions\nin the case, and some are actually no longer in dispute\nso that will help to simplify a very complicated matter\na little bit.\nOne is according to the question presented,\nwhether the criminal contempt proceeding for violating a\ncivil protective order must be brought in the name of\nthe United States, so actually have United States in the\ncaption. And I think now all the parties agree, there\nis no constitutional requirement that the caption of the\ncase actually say \"United States.\" So to the extent\nthat answers the question about what does the plea\nagreement cover, we don't have a dispute about that.\nThere's no constitutional reason why the court of\nappeals has to be reversed.\nSo the other part of the question, as it's\nframed in the question is does it have to be brought\npursuant to the power of the United States. That's not\nlanguage that is in the court of appeals opinion -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand your point. Yes, the caption doesn't have to\nbe styled in a particular name -\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the prosecuting\nperson -\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the person whose name\nis listed is acting for someone.\nMR. LONG: Yes. Is the real party in\ninterest the United States?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. LONG: And I agree, that's mostly what\nwe have to talk about this morning, but I'm trying to\nbracket it with issues that are really not properly in\ndispute here.\nOne is, the caption is not a constitutional\nissue. Another is, as Petitioner has said over and over\nagain, the actual ability of a private, interested\nparty, the question that was left open in Young, under\nthe Constitution, under the Due Process Clause or under\nseparation of powers, is that constitutional for\nMs. Watson to even do this, as the representative of the\nUnited States or on her own behalf?\nThey have said over and over again, they are\nnot raising that question. In their reply brief to the\ncourt of appeals, they say they in no way challenge\nthat. In their post-argument brief to the court of\nappeals, they say the assertion that they are\nchallenging it is just wrong. In their supplemental\nbrief to this Court at the cert stage, they say they -\nthey decline to raise that question. And even in their\nreply brief here, they say they have not raised the\nissue left unresolved in Young.\nSo that is a very important issue. And I\nthink that issue is really -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you define what you\nsee as that issue? What's the issue that you think -\nMR. LONG: That's the issue of whether a\nprivate interested party, either on their own behalf or\nas the representative of the sovereign, can bring a\ncriminal contempt action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean? Not on\ntheir own -- not on their own behalf. I mean, that -\nthat's a quite different issue. That's the issue that\nwas decided below, whether -\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether a private\ninterested party can be authorized to bring the suit on\nbehalf of the sovereign.\nMR. LONG: Yes. What I'm trying to do is\nnarrow down to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but you -\nyou covered two things. You said whether a private\nindividual can bring it on his own.\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or whether a private\nindividual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the\nsovereign.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought it was\nonly -- only the second of these that you say is out of\nthe case. You say the first is out of the case, too?\nMR. LONG: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMR. LONG: I think -- I think the -- all\nthey have conceded is that for purposes of this case, we\nare going to assume that -- well, I may have given you\nthe wrong answer to you -- we are -- they have said over\nand over again, we assume, that a private interested\nparty can bring a criminal contempt proceeding. And so\nwe think, given the importance of -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As representative of\nthe sovereign?\nMR. LONG: Well, I -- I think that question\nis fairly before the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And nobody doubts --\nI didn't think it was at issue that the United States,\nrather than operating through the Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution.\nMR. LONG: Exactly. Exactly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's what they\ndon't dispute, right?\nMR. LONG: Maybe a different way of making\nthe -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, that's -\nthey don't dispute that? That's the point you were\ntrying to make?\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, repeat it for\nme. I sort of -\nMR. LONG: The point is, they are not\ndisputing, and they've said over and over again they're\nnot disputing that a private, interested individual,\nlike Ms. Watson, the individual in this case, can bring\nthis proceeding. Now -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On whose behalf? That's\nthe issue that I'm trying to -\nMR. LONG: And the issue that I think is\nbefore the Court is, would that be as a representative\nof the United States or would that be as a private\nperson?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Are you saying\nthat it's out of the case that if we say it's on behalf\nof the United States, they are not challenging that they\ncan do that?\nMR. LONG: Yes. Yes. I think they have not\nchallenged that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's so -- so if we\nsay they can act on behalf of the United States, you -\nMR. LONG: Yes. And I will say, there is an\noddity to this, because in many ways, the bigger\nquestion is the question that the Court left open in\nYoung, since that's not been properly raised, not\nproperly decided, by the court below, not properly\nbriefed, it is a little odd to be answering this other\nquestion of: Well, assuming that the private party can\ndo this, would it be in the interest of the United\nStates?\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, if, in\nfact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but\nthe government says and they say, the government of the\nUnited States has here -- and it can, under the\nConstitution, delegate to a private person the authority\nto prosecute.\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is a big argument\nagainst that.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The argument is: This\nwould be the one person you can't delegate it to because\nthey are very biased.\nMR. LONG: Right. And my -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that argument, you say,\nis not in this case.\nMR. LONG: Exactly. Exactly. So -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now we have what\nis in the case, which is the question of whether,\nleaving that argument out of it, did they hear or -\nMR. LONG: So let me now address the point\nthat: Is it a constitutional requirement? No matter\nwhat the legislature says, that any criminal contempt\nproceeding must be brought in the interest of the\nsovereign, not in the interest of a private party. That\nmay seem like a fairly obvious proposition, but I want\nto submit it's actually much harder than the Court\nactually should agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean\nby \"in the interest of\"? On behalf of? Is that what\nyou mean? Are you saying -- you acknowledge here that\nit is on behalf of the United States but you say it\ndoesn't have to be in the interest of the United States,\nis that it?\nMR. LONG: Well, the language that the court\nof appeals used is in the interest of the United States.\nWho is the real party in interest?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that\nmeans. Are you asserting that this suit has been\nbrought on behalf of the United States by your client?\nMR. LONG: No. I want to make an argument\nthat actually, the D.C. legislature and the D.C. courts\nare constitutionally permitted to determine that in this\nspecific situation, the interests of the individual\nactually predominate over the interests of the\ngovernment and there is not a constitutional problem.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that even relevant?\nWhy do you even get to that? Isn't the question what\nthe parties understood the plea agreement to mean?\nMR. LONG: Well, I agree with you completely\nJustice Alito. The ultimate question is exactly what\nyou say. And we think under any reasonable construction\nof the plea agreement, it does not bar this proceeding.\nAs Justice Stevens said, these have gone on for.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's highly relevant, I\nthink, because I think you would you like to make the\nargument, which I would like to hear, is that: Forget\nthe United States. The Constitution permits this woman\nto bring the case as a private citizen.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, if you are right about\nthat, the plea agreement drops out.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because nobody says made a\nplea agreement with her. Because that is the argument\nyou want to make at some point.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LONG: I will make the argument,\nalthough if I am wrong, I still think the plea agreement\ndoesn't bar this prosecution. Here's -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But, well -- well, with\nrespect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the\nparties understood the plea agreement to mean that this\nwas going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of\nthe matter?\nMR. LONG: Well, it's what a reasonable\nperson would have understood Justice Alito, when the\nplea agreement says, crosses out District of Columbia,\ncrosses out corporation counsel, and we are now all\nagreed that Ms. Watson, in her own name, can bring this\nproceeding under a statute that authorizes it and has\nfor 20 years -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And I suppose the argument\ncould be that the -- that the government has no\nauthority under D.C. law to enter into such an\nagreement, as well require these two -\nMR. LONG: Well, that's -- now we are\ngetting into statutory issues, Justice Alito. I mean,\nthis case is a constitutional case, with no such\nstatutory issue was raised or decided by the court\nbelow. Typically, this Court treats the D.C. court of\nappeals as -- as final, as a practical matter, on issues\nof D.C. law. So, I think that is going off in a\ncompletely different direction.\nBut on the issue -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I have really lost\nyou. What is going off in a different direction?\nReally?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LONG: The issue is, it's a matter of\nD.C. statute. There was some problem with this\nprosecution. I mean, that's really something else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay. You're -\nyou're asserting that this agreement with the United\nStates Attorney cannot cover this case because your\nclient was not acting on behalf of the United States,\nbut rather in her private capacity.\nMR. LONG: Yes, and let me make that\nargument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's perfectly okay,\nright?\nMR. LONG: If -- if that is a constitutional\nrequirement. It is in Blackstone, we admit that, for\ncrimes in general, but we are talking about contempt.\nBut if it's a constitutional requirement, it has got to\nbe in the Constitution someplace. Petitioners say it's\nbecause the Constitution uses words like \"crimes.\"\nWell, you know, the Court has been very\ncautious about implying common law rules,\nconstitutionalizing common law rules, because of words\nin the Constitution -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one way you\ncan find it in the Constitution is that we have built a\nbody of law about the obligation of people bringing\nprosecutions that wouldn't fit within your situation.\nFor -- what are the Brady -- what's the\nBrady obligation of your client?\nMR. LONG: Well, if you will bear with me, I\nthink the Constitution does answer questions like the\nBrady question, but it's not the penumbras and\nemanations of words like crimes. It's because -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are the Brady\nobligations of your client?\nMR. LONG: Well, I -- I think because the\nway -- the way this Court has defined criminal contempt\ndoes not look to the interest of the party versus the\ninterest of the sovereign; in fact, the Court has said\nover and over again in Bagwell and Hicks and other cases\nthat in all criminal contempt cases, civil and criminal,\nto some extent the interest of the sovereign is that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what are the\nBrady obligations of your client?\nMR. LONG: Due process says this is a\ncriminal proceeding, Your Honor, if I can explain in a\nminute, and therefore, all the due process rights of a\n-- for a petty criminal offense apply. And I would say\nthat -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your client has to\nprovide the -- her husband a lawyer? Who has to provide\na lawyer in this criminal contempt proceeding?\nMR. LONG: D.C. courts do provide lawyers if\nthe -- to the defendant. I mean a very important point\nhere is these are often pro se cases, where the woman\ncomes in to say -- or the petitioner; it's usually a\nwoman, it doesn't have to be -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know if you have\nanswered the Chief's question. He has asked to have a\nlawyer; is there a Brady obligation? What are the\nconstitutional entitlements -\nMR. LONG: They -- they come from the Due\nProcess Clause. And if I could have just the Court's\nindulgence for one minute, I think the answer to a lot\nof these questions is not looking to penumbras and\nemanations from crimes, but looking at this Court's\ndecisions deciding what is criminal contempt and what is\ncivil contempt. And as I started -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But can we get to the\nBrady? That was one of the questions I had, too. Let's\nsay we have the -- we'll call it a private person as\nprosecuting.\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that person have a -\na right to look at all the government files to see if\nthere is any exonerating evidence?\nMR. LONG: Well -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, how does it work?\nThat's what we want to know.\nMR. LONG: This is a determinate sentence,\nso under this Court's cases, without regard to whether\nthe government's interests are -- take precedence over\nthe private interests, it's criminal. So you get all\nthe rights that the Due Process Clause gives you in a -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But how does it work?\nDoes -- does the -- does the person who is bringing this\nprosecution have the right to go in and -- and look at\nthe -- all -- all of the files that the police have -\nMR. LONG: Well, right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and that the prosecutor\nhas? That's the only way Brady would work.\nMR. LONG: In this case the court said that\nthe Brady rights did apply. I mean, this is another\nreason why I would urge the Court not to try to decide a\nnumber of very important questions about a very\nimportant system that has not really been properly\npresented in D.C.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do we do about that?\nBecause it's very hard for me to focus on the case -\nthe issue you want me to decide -\nMR. LONG: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- without thinking about\nthe one you don't.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reasons, as I have\ncategorized this -- the -\nMR. LONG: There are -- it may be that this\nis the wrong case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what do --- so what do\nwe do? I mean, I think of this as like Aeschylus; you\nhave the Furies gradually giving way to justice.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, private -\nMR. LONG: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- vengeance is out and\njustice is in, and we have 3,000 years of that, and they\nare all going to be variations of that theme and we\ncould think of 100 arguments. Boasting. Then is this\nspecial?\nMR. LONG: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, before I can answer\nthat question, I would like to know whether the\ngovernment could appoint the private person. After all\nthere is a check -- there is a check against the total\nFuries, it's the government doing it. Now you say no,\nthe government can't do it, so -- but they can do it on\ntheir own. Maybe -- I don't know.\nMR. LONG: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do I get my -- how do I\nbegin to answer these questions bound together in my\nmind in some partial way?\nMR. LONG: Well, part -- part of the answer\nis, of course, that the court exercises control.\nAnother part of the answer is that the D.C. legislature,\nwhich is exercising delegated legislative authority from\nCongress, has determined that this is in the public\ninterest.\nAnd you know, the third part of it is that\nwe are not granting these private individuals excessive\nauthority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you want to do that.\nYou see, so there is no control. You are saying we want\nthe private individuals to have the authority to bring\ncriminal contempt; they are on their own; they decide\nit. The government has nothing to say about this. It's\na totally private matter.\nMR. LONG: No, but -- but you know, D.C.\ntried for over a decade to do this with public\nprosecutors, and there just were not enough resources.\nSo what we are allowing here, if I could take it a\nstop -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some problems have no\nanswers. I mean, that doesn't prove anything.\nMR. LONG: Well -- there may -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that Congress\ncould -- could set up a private organization to expend\nFederal funds -- we are going to abolish the Department\nof Education. And we are going to give its function to\na private organization that will take care of all those\nthings. No good, right?\nMR. LONG: Well, but there is a long, long\ntradition of having private individuals undertake\nprosecutions of crimes. I mean, so what you're\nsaying -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On -- on behalf of -\nMR. LONG: On behalf of.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on behalf of the\nexecutive.\nYou are looking for a section of the\nConstitution; I suggest Article II, Section 1, the\nexecutive power shall be vested in the President.\nMR. LONG: Well, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And just as the executive\npower includes the power to expend funds appropriated by\nCongress, so also the executive power except in the -\nin the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young,\nwhich I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in\nthat one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute\nbelongs to the executive.\nMR. LONG: But -- but Justice Scalia, we are\ndealing with the District of Columbia. The Constitution\ndoes not assign any powers over the District to the\nexecutive or to the judicial branch.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now the State\nof California, trying to save money, say we have a very\ngood idea. We are going to pass one law, abolish all\nthe prosecutors' offices and say wherever there is a\nvictim of crime, that victim will bring the prosecution.\nNow you really are back to the Furies. Is that\nconstitutional?\nMR. LONG: Well -- and again, there is\nabundant historical precedent for that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, there was, before -\nbefore Aeschylus. Or whatever. But the -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You would say that that is\nconstitutional -\nMR. LONG: Well, if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to have a statute that\nall criminal prosecutions would be brought by victims,\nperiod?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think there would be\ntoday serious due process problems to work through with\nthat sort of system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If there are,\nthen why aren't there the same here?\nMR. LONG: Well, I would also say the\nFramers would have understood that to be a perfectly\nnormal system. They would not have thought it was\nunconstitutional, because private prosecutions were -\nwere common at the time of the Framers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I don't think that's\nright. Private prosecutions were common at the time of\nthe framing? You have got to go back a long way before\nthey were common.\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean there -- that issue\nis debated in the briefs and I think it was less common\nin the colonies in the United States than it was in\nBritain, but certainly wouldn't have been regarded as -\nas unconstitutional.\nBut this is -- now we are back to the\nquestion that I say really the Court should not decide\nbecause it was never properly -- whether this can be\ndone by a private individual at all, even as the\nrepresentative of the government. So I don't think you\nshould get into that.\nBut if you do -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure why -- how\nwe can avoid it.\nMR. LONG: Well, you could wait for a case\nthat presents it -- that properly presents it, where it\ncan be decided -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, this case properly\npresents the argument that a private party can't bring a\ncriminal prosecution on their -- in their own -- perhaps\ntheir own name, they can, but on their own, in their own\ninterest. It always has to be a government interest.\nThat's what the argument is.\nMR. LONG: Yes. And that -- that is\nsomething that the Court we think could properly decide.\nBut Justice Breyer, I would -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are saying the\nanswer to that is, no, they can bring a claim in their\nown name?\nMR. LONG: Yes, we -- we are arguing two\nthings. They can bring it in their own name, that's not\nunconstitutional; and they can certainly -- they could\ncertainly bring it as the representative of the\ngovernment, that is also constitutional. And -- and so\nthere are two ways -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. But the last\nquestion is the one that they are disputing; it can't be\nin their own interest.\nMR. LONG: Yes, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you are saying it\ncan.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Answer why.\nMR. LONG: Because the D.C. Council said\nthey could do it. So we have a legislature that has\nsaid that the interest of a private party here takes\nprecedence, and that is not an unconstitutional\ndetermination by the legislature. In this Court's\ncriminal contempt cases, the Court has said we don't\nlook to whose interest is paramount or what this -- the\nlegislature or what the Court says whose interest is\nparamount.\nWe recognize that both kinds of contempt,\ncivil and criminal, further the sovereign's interest in\nvindicating the court's orders and further the private\ninterest in seeing that that order which applies\nparticularly to that party is followed.\nSo you don't look to that at all. You just\nlook to the nature of the punishment. And if it's a\ndeterminate sentence versus a coercive sentence, then\nit's criminal. So that answers all the questions about\nBrady and what sort of due process -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You might -- you might -\nyou might say this. To answer your question that is\nhere, there are a couple of ways of doing this. One way\nyou would say is, well, don't worry about this so much.\nIf the answer is no, you can still bring your private\nprosecution but you have got to get government\npermission, because you are doing it in the way of the\ngovernment.\nBut if the answer to the question is if you\ncan't do either, they you might say, then why wouldn't\nyou say why well, aren't we back to the Eumenides, and\nthe answer is going to be this is say contempt.\nContempt is special.\nI don't know whether either or both of those\nways would work. So what would you think, since the\ngovernment has changed its position, of sending this\nback so some of these things can be worked out? At\nleast we would have some opinions that would help us.\nMR. LONG: Well, you know, I think that\nwould be an unfortunate result in the sense that, you\nknow, the plea agreement in our view doesn't prevent\nthis prosecution on any reasonable interpretation. You\nknow, we also think for the reasons I have been trying\nto spell out that there is no real basis for the Court\nto hold that it is unconstitutional, only in the\ncriminal contempt setting, for the D.C. legislature to\nfind that the private interest here justifies allowing\nthe private party to bring this action but it's still\ncriminal.\nBecause it's a determinate sentence, you get\nall the due process just as you would as -- if the\ngovernment brought it. You get all the due process\nrights which in fact the defendant did get here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless you\nthink it's a violation of due process for an interested\nparty to be able to criminally prosecute someone at\ntheir -- at their discretion.\nMR. LONG: Well, and that -- and, you\nknow -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to plea bargain\nwith a -- with an interested party?\nMR. LONG: Well, but Mr. Chief Justice and\nJustice Scalia, I mean, this is a system that is in all\nthe States. It's not just domestic violence. It's\nchild custody. It's child support. The amicus briefs\nsay this is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Criminal -- criminal\ncontempt prosecution or civil contempt prosecution?\nMR. LONG: Well -- well, but -- yes.\nCriminal contempt for violation of court orders about\ndomestic violence, about child custody, about child\nsupport.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are in every\nstate?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be order\nto show cause, but you are saying that every state\nallows a private person to have a criminal prosecution\nfor criminal contempt?\nMR. LONG: Well, the -- the amicus briefs\nat -- 19 allow -- at this point, 19 allow you to file a\nmotion. These things are typically begun by motion, not\na charging document. And just say -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a -- a motion is\ndifferent.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the courts decide -\nthen the court decides based on the position of the\ndefendant, of the person who is charged with contempt -\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- whether or not to\nproceed. And the court certainly can appoint a\nprosecutor, and does in many states.\nMR. LONG: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And\nthat's really what we're asking. I mean, if you think\nabout these situations, many thousands of cases, most of\nthese individuals have no lawyers. They are pro se. A\ncivil order is entered, about domestic violence, child\ncustody, child support. It's violated, or the\nindividual thinks it's violated.\nWhat do they do? They come to the court on\ntheir own, so now they are pro se, so now maybe we're in\nthe Furies and Young and Province. But this is -- to\nmake the system work, we at least, I submit, have to\nallow those individuals to come to the court and file a\nmotion, even though they are interested in, say,\nsomebody's violating the order, Judge, you should do\nsomething about it -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that's a\ndifferent matter.\nMR. LONG: No. No. No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's -- why\nisn't it a different matter?\nMR. LONG: I mean, that's what -- that's\nwhat happened in this case. It so happens this woman\nwas represented by the D.C. Attorney General, who is a\npublic prosecutor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so now you are into\nthe question of what counts as a prosecution.\nMR. LONG: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there again, I am at\nsea. I don't know what the authority is.\nMR. LONG: Well, if I could -- if I can just\ndo it step by step. I mean, in this case and in tens of\nthousands of other cases, the first step is just\nallowing that motion to be filed. And if you don't\nallow that, you say that's unconstitutional, the entire\nsystem will -- will blow up.\nSo if you at least get to that, then we say,\nwell -- the judge looks at it and says, well, civil's\nnot appropriate here because the violation is over; if I\nam going to punish this, it's going to have to be a\ndeterminant sentence, that's criminal. At that point,\nunder this Court's cases, due process requires all sorts\nof things to protect the defendant.\nHe gets a lawyer, or the other -- now, it\nwould say, you don't have -- the Constitution doesn't\nrequire that there be a lawyer appointed to prosecute\nevery one of these, or that would be my submission. So\nlet the individual come in and file a motion. Let the\ncourt come in and look at it. Don't require a\nprosecutor to be appointed, interested or disinterested.\nAnd then at that point, if the Court is exercising\nsufficient control over this, to say if -- if the\nperson, the woman, happens to have that lawyer, that\nlawyer has to just stand aside and can't play any\nrole -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the situation here\nin D.C.? When the woman comes in, can the judge look it\nover and say, Ah, you don't have anything here; I'm not\ngoing to -- I'm not going to allow you to go ahead.\nMR. LONG: Well, you know, we have no record\non any of this, Justice Scalia, because it was not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you understand -\nhow does the statute read? As I understand it, it's not\nup to the judge to decide whether there is enough there\nto allow her to go forward or to appoint somebody on his\nown. She is the prosecutor. It's up to her whether\nthere is -\nMR. LONG: The way the statute and the court\nrules read is you file a motion, not an indictment or an\ninformation, a motion to hold the person in contempt.\nAs I understand it, it is set down for a\nhearing. I mean, that's sort of the way the family\ncourt works. So they will have a hearing and the judge\nwill look at it, will see what's going on, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A hearing on whether she\ncan prosecute or a hearing on -- on whether he's going\nto be guilty or not.\nMR. LONG: You know, I am very uncomfortable\nto spend -- I have gone and observed one of these and\nI've talked to one of the judges, but none of this is in\nthe record, Justice Scalia. I mean, I think what they\ntypically do is try to figure out what it's about,\nwhether it's civil or criminal. If it's criminal, they\nwould appoint a lawyer for the defendant and then they\nwould take it from there, but this is a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can your private\nprosecutor, however you want to describe her, could she\nenter into a plea agreement with the defendant?\nMR. LONG: Well, they can -- they can agree\nto withdraw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, she said you\ncould be subject to you 180 days; I will agree, and\nyou'll plead guilty to 30 days.\nMR. LONG: Again, none of this is in the\nrecord. My understanding is, that doesn't happen,\nalthough I am honestly not sure. I think it would be up\nto the Court to -- to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or pay $1,000 to your\nvictim, which is me.\nMR. LONG: Well, you know, I have no\ninformation about whether that sort of thing happens or\nhow the Court would treat it. But I think my basic\npoint is, you know, this is a very important system, not\njust to the District of Columbia, but to the whole\ncountry. And the details -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I accept that -\nMR. LONG: And the details matter. And to\nchange it to a system where we now say there have to\nbe -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But a specific\ncountry -- this is the point Justice Scalia was\nmaking -- the rest of the country, it's a state system.\nMR. LONG: Well, but -- but D.C., Your\nHonor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and there -\nMR. LONG: -- is like a state in the sense\nthat separation of powers -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's -\nthat's the question. That's the question that I don't\nknow that we have enough information in the record\nabout. Is this really -- is this prosecution like a\nstate? That's the Solicitor General's position, which\nis, it's on behalf of the local government, not on the\nbehalf of the Federal government as a sovereign. I\nthink that's what this case speaks to.\nMR. LONG: If you look at them -- if you\nlook at this Court's decision in Palmore. I mean, we\nare dealing with an Article I court of the District of\nColumbia, not an Article III court, to the extent that\nthe sovereign's interest is at stake here. Let's keep\nthe interest of that Article I court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there somewhere I can\nlook to see what happens? All I can find in the long\nlaw is that a violation of the order is a contempt.\nFine; no problem. And then the only word about the\nPetitioner, it says the Petitioner is entitled to relief\nunder this chapter, which contains about 50 different\nthings. And it doesn't say what kind of relief. It\ndoesn't say how you get relief. It doesn't say if you\nare just asking -- all those things you raised. So how\ndo I find out actually what is in the system.\nMR. LONG: You mean the relief for contempt?\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that. It\nsays the earlier part of this statute which goes on for\nsix pages in an earlier part of this statue, which goes\non for six pages, seven pages. It says, a Petitioner\nhas a right to seek relief under this subchapter.\nNow, that contains civil contempt. It\ncontains how you get protective orders. It contains a\nlot of things that are absolutely noncontroversial. So\nI am trying to figure out: What is the system?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think -- I think the\nhonest answer is, Justice Breyer, you can find some of\nthese things by looking around, but since we've been\ntalking about issues that were not properly litigated\nand not decided and we do not have a well-developed\nrecord, some of these things are just not going to be\navailable.\nAnd again, we think -- you know, this case\nstarted out about a plea agreement. It's really a small\ncase. We are now talking about these great big issues.\nWe think the plea agreement doesn't bar this under any\nreasonable construction, and so the right result is\neither to dismiss the cases as improvidentally granted\nor to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Kagan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELENA KAGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nGENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThere are two questions, properly raised, in\nthis case. Petitioner is right about one. Respondent\nis right about the other and the disposition. There are\na couple of questions that are extremely interesting --\nI can see why the Court is interested in them -- but\nwere not properly raised in this case, and this Court\nshould not decide them.\nWhat Petitioner is right about is that in\nthis criminal contempt action, Ms. Watson, the\nRespondent, was and must have been exercising sovereign\npower, that she was acting as a state actor for purposes\nof the Constitution.\nWhat Respondent is right about -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whose state power was\nshe acting on behalf of?\nGENERAL KAGAN: The way we understand this,\nJustice Sotomayor, is that Respondent was exercising\nsovereign power on behalf of the Article I court, the\nD.C. court, which of course is partly a local court, but\nis exercising power whose initial source, original\nsource, is Congress.\nSo she is exercising sovereign power in\norder to vindicate the Court's order, the order of -- of\nrestraint.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Courts don't have the power\nto incarcerate people. I mean, if you are prosecuting\nfor a criminal offense, you are exercising more than the\npower of the Court.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I -- I don't believe that is\nthe case, Justice Scalia. Imagine Respondent\nessentially doing the same function that an appointed\nperson would do in Young. There, of course, the court\nappointed the person to prosecute contempt. Here\nRespondent is essentially doing the same thing, is\nacting in order to prosecute a contempt on the court and\nto vindicate the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But nobody asserted in\nYoung that the prosecutor appointed by the court was\nonly exercising the power of the court. Surely it was\nthe power of the government that the -- that the\nprosecutor was exercising. Now, the court was given the\npower to appoint that prosecutor, but I would think it's\nextraordinary to say that there's nothing but the\ncourt's power in play.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, the court is surely\npart of the government, and in the end this is power of\nthe United States. The court is created through power\nof the United States. It's an Article I court. And so\nRespondent is no doubt exercising sovereign power and\nexercising it on behalf of the United States ultimately.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then why doesn't an\nagreement by the United States not to prosecute carry\nthe day?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, so this goes to the\nsecond question, in which I think Respondent is right.\nAnd the reason is that when a single U.S. Attorney's\nOffice says that the government will decide to drop a\ncertain set of charges, that U.S. Attorney's Office we\nbelieve is -- is speaking for itself, unless there is\nsome indication that it is speaking more widely in such\na way that will bind other parts of the government.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's -- that's\nabsolutely startling. The different U.S. Attorneys all\nwork for your boss, right? They work for the Attorney\nGeneral. How can one part of the Attorney General agree\nto something that doesn't bind the other part of the\nAttorney General?\nGENERAL KAGAN: The United States Government\nis a complicated place and the fact that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take your word for\nit.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- and the fact that the\nSouthern District of New York agrees to do one thing\ndoes not bind, for example, the INS, does not\nbind the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe or maybe not,\nbut surely it binds the New Jersey U.S. Attorney. If\nyou -- just think about it. The -- the U.S. Attorney\nfrom the Southern District says: Look, you agree to go\nto jail for 10 years and I will drop these 3 charges.\nDone. Then the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey can come in\nand prosecute under those three charges?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Assuming that the U.S.\nAttorney in the second office has jurisdiction and\nassuming that the plea agreement does not say anything\nto suggest that it should be read more broadly, I think\nthe answer is yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you\nget -- I mean, you are a defendant. You have to go to\nall more than 50, all the U.S. Attorney's Offices and\nsay, will you agree to this and get everybody to sign\noff?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\neven if you are right I think that we prevail. There\nare two views in the court system. One is the Second\nand Seventh Circuit and they take the position that I've\ntaken, which is that the default position is that the\ncontracting party binds only the contracting party and\nthat the plea agreement needs to say something in order\nto apply more broadly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It can't do that.\nIf the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has the authority to\nprosecute this, the U.S. Attorney in New York can't say,\noh, and by the way I bind all the other U.S. Attorneys.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, the U.S. Attorney in\nNew York could -- presumably that U.S. Attorney will\nknow who else might have jurisdiction over the\nunderlying conduct and would go and get an agreement\nfrom those other U.S. attorneys. But unless the U.S.\nAttorney does that, under one approach the agreement\nbars only the contracting entity. But even if you're\nright -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do I understand your\nposition that in this particular case the U.S. Attorney\ncould have entered into a settlement agreement that\nwould have bound the Respondent?\nGENERAL KAGAN: We actually don't think that\nthat's right, Justice Stevens. We think that in fact\nthe U.S. Attorney did not bind the Respondent, but we\ndon't think it could have bound the Respondent, and it\ngoes back to my answer to Justice Sotomayor, because\nRespondent here is representing the D.C. court system.\nAnd so the U.S. Attorney really would have had -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You draw a distinction\nbetween the D.C. Circuit -- the D.C. and the United\nStates?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes. Ultimately the D.C.\ncourt system is an actor that is wielding United States\nauthority. But it's a very different -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree, I\ntake it, that the attorney for the District of Columbia\ncould have bound Respondent? Somebody could bind\nRespondent without Respondent even knowing about it,\nthat's what I'm asking.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think only the D.C. court\ncould have prevented Respondent from going forward. I\nthink that the U.S. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I have to agree with\nyou that to accept this argument that the prosecutor\nhere is an agent just of the court, just of the D.C.\ncourt, not an agent of the executive?\nGENERAL KAGAN: If -- who would you like the\nperson be an agent of, Justice Scalia?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not making the\nargument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Usually we have\nquestions the other way.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I apologize.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that courts\nhave ever asserted that they themselves have the power\nto prosecute.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I do think that that's\nthe situation that we find in Young, where a court\nappoints a person to prosecute a contempt on behalf of\nthe court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not on behalf of the court.\nOn behalf of the government, and that's why Young said\nyou should offer it first to the United States Attorney,\nand only if he won't bring it, then you can appoint\nsomebody else to bring it. But the -- the prosecutor is\nnot the court. My God. What a terrible situation. The\nprosecutor's the court, the judge is the court?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I do think Young is\ndifferent, Justice Scalia, because Young was a\nseparation of powers case. This case is not because it\narises in D.C. In Young, absolutely the judge has to go\nto the U.S. Attorney's Office first. But that's not the\ncase here, because normal separation of powers\nprinciples are not in application in D.C.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it the case that only\nthe U.S. Attorney can prosecute for this crime? Could\nthe D.C. attorney general or whatever the name of it,\nwhat, counsel, prosecute for this felony?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Scalia, I don't\nbelieve that is entirely clear. I think that the court\ncould ask the D.C. Attorney General to prosecute the\ncrime in the same way that the court in Young asked the\nU.S. Attorney's Office.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it's all up to the\ncourt; the court's the big prosecutor, right?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, just as -- I know you\ndissented in Young, Justice Scalia. But just as the\ncourt in Young goes to the U.S. Attorney first and when\nthe court is told no the court can appoint its own\nindependent prosecutor, essentially that's what is\nhappening here. The court is appointing -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if there were a\nfinding of innocent, or not guilty, by this prosecutor,\ncould the official prosecutor then prosecute again, or\nwould there be double jeopardy? If you are saying they\nare somehow separate, does the double jeopardy clause\napply?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, this Court held in\nDixon that the double jeopardy clause does apply,\nbecause they're all exercising power -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was the\nsame authority.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, and they all are\nexercising power from the United States. Dixon involved\nthis very statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you don't think this is\na Bartkiss-like case, like Bartkiss v. Illinois?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I -- I am not familiar with\nthat case, Justice Kennedy, but I do think that the\ndouble jeopardy clause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That a State prosecution\ndoesn't bar a later Federal prosecution.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's exactly right,\nbecause ultimately all of these power are exercising\npower that comes from the same source, which is the\nUnited States Government.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is your argument the broad\nargument that the Chief Justice was talking about, that\nwe have a man who drives in a car from Baltimore to rob\na bank in Washington and the U.S. Attorney in Washington\ngives him a piece of paper which says, I will not\nprosecute you for this now or in the future, and\nsuddenly the U.S. Attorney in Baltimore prosecutes it.\nAre you saying that that is barred or not barred?\nThat's the broad argument.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, under several -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or are you making a narrow\nargument?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Under several circuits'\nlaw -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm just asking you\nyour position on that. Can the -- does this piece of\npaper from the U.S. Attorney in Washington bar\nprosecution by the U.S. attorney in Baltimore? Yes or\nno?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I have a principal position\nand I have a back-up position. My principal position is\nyes, it does, for the reason that I gave to the Chief\nJustice. To the extent that there is skepticism -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does bar?\nGENERAL KAGAN: It does. The full rule is\nthat the bar is only as to the office that -- that\nexecutes the agreement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I ask\nyou could a 1983 or I guess Bivens action be brought\nagainst Ms. Watson? The defendant, you know, it turns\nout he's not guilty and he thinks there was malice.\nCould he bring a Bivens action against her?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I have\nnot thought about that question. I am completely clear\nas to your -- the question that you asked to Mr. Long,\nwhich is does she have Brady obligations. She does have\nBrady obligations. She was held to Brady obligations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She's a State actor.\nShe's acting on behalf either of the United States or\nthe District of Columbia. Therefore, she can be sued\ndirectly and be personally liable.\nGENERAL KAGAN: She -- it is absolutely\nright that she is a State actor for constitutional\npurposes. And she was treated as such throughout this\nlitigation.\nTo go back to Justice Breyer's point -- may\nI?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, briefly.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer's question,\nthe Chief Justice's question: Even circuits that apply\na default rule whereby the government is the entire\ngovernment and there needs to be limiting things in the\nagreement, I think if you look at this agreement you\nwill find those limiting things, both in the cross-outs\nin the caption and in the particular promises that the\nUnited States Government has made, which applies really\nonly to the United States Attorney's Office.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMs. Frankfurt, you have 7 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACLYN S. FRANKFURT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. FRANKFURT: Thank you.\nI just want to say in response both to -- to\nMr. Long's comments, that a lack record as to what\nactually occurred or the general comment, about whether\nor not Ms. Watson was treated as a State actor -- I\nactually think there is a -- a decent record in this\ncase that what occurred was not a motion to request the\ncourt to issue a show cause, but in fact, a -- a motion\nthat requested -- that triggered a ministerial act,\nwhich was an act -- which was used as a charging\ndocument, which the judge believed she had no\ndiscretion, and the Assistant Attorney General, who was\nrepresenting the Petitioner, believed she had no\ndiscretion to control, and Ms. Watson was treated as\nbringing the action on her own behalf.\nThat's what the lower court held as a\nfactual matter, and I think it is quite supported by the\nrecord.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this: The\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals said we are\nsatisfied that no objectively reasonable person could\nunderstand that Mr. Robertson's plea agreement bound\nMs. Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against\nMr. Robertson. If we accept that, is there any other\nissue in this case?\nMS. FRANKFURT: If you -- yes. The issue is\nwhether she could constitutionally bring the case on her\nown.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And did you preserve that?\nIf -- if Mr. -- Mr. Robertson had said, I understand\nthis only means that I am not going to be charged with a\n-- a criminal offense by the United States Attorney's\nOffice for the District of Columbia, and it has no\napplication to this civil contempt proceeding.\nMS. FRANKFURT: We absolutely raise that\nbecause our argument from -- from the very beginning was\nshe can't constitutionally be representing herself in\nthis proceeding. If this is happening constitutionally,\nshe represents the United States, and if she represents\nthe United States, then our plea agreement bars it\nbecause our plea agreement was with the government.\nIt indicated the government will not -- will\nnot pursue, and any reasonable person in a -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's a separate\nquestion. So the first question is: What was agreed to\nunder the plea agreement, right?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Yes, and at the time that we\nsigned the plea agreement, there was no precedent for\nthe notion of a private person bringing a criminal\naction in her own name, interest and on her own behalf.\nNo one would have contemplated that such a thing was\nconstitutional, because you know, back until appeals of\nfelonies -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Just so I understand what is\nbefore us, you preserve -- you saying -- you are saying\nyou preserve the issue that even if your client fully\nunderstood that this plea agreement had no application\nto a criminal contempt proceeding, he preserved the\nargument that he could contest the criminal contempt\nproceeding on the ground that it would be\nunconstitutional?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I'm sorry. I am not -- I am\nnot sure that I'm understanding, or that my words\nhaven't been misinterpreted.\nIt's certainly not the case that when my -\nthat the reasonable interpretation of that plea\nagreement was that it wouldn't apply to a criminal\ncontempt proceeding. The only -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. I\nunderstand there's the contract issue. But did you -\nin the lower court, did you argue even if he gave that\nup, under the plea agreement, the criminal contempt\nproceeding still could not be brought?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Even if he gave up the right\nof a private person to prosecute on her own behalf? Any\nagreement -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if he didn't get that\n-- a bar to that under the plea agreement, the contempt\nproceeding would still be barred for some other reason?\nDid you make that argument?\nMS. FRANKFURT: I am not sure that I can\nanswer that we did, because I am not sure that I -- I\nunderstand the question. I -- I know that we did make\nthe argument that it could only have lawfully been\nbrought on behalf of the sovereign, and that the\nsovereign was the United States. And so our view was if\nthis Court views it the way the lower court did, which\nwas as an action between private parties, then it's\nunconstitutional under Gompers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You did raise, undoubtedly\nyou say, the point that the only way in which she could\nbe the prosecutor was as an agent of the United States?\nMS. FRANKFURT: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that it was\nunconstitutional for her to -- to represent herself.\nMS. FRANKFURT: Absolutely. I think we\nwrote the word, you know, \"whoever stands in the well of\nthe courtroom, it doesn't matter who that person is;\nthat person represents the sovereign.\" That's the only\nconstitutional way. If it's viewed that way, it's\nbarred by the plea agreement. If it's not viewed that\nway, as the lower court construed the local statute to\npermit, then Gompers v. Buck's Stove does -- there is no\nauthority there to impose a criminal penalty. We would\nask the Court to reverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
