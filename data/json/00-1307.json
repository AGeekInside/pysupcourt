        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-1307, Larry Massanari, Acting Commissioner\nof Social Security v. the Sigmon Coal Company.\nMr. Wolfson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress enacted the Coal Act to prevent the\ncollapse of a multi-employer, private health care system\nthat had promised health care benefits to retired coal\nminers. Miners were in danger of losing their benefits as\ncoal operators were selling their operations and\ndissolving and going out of business and shifting\nresponsibility for their employees to other employers that\nwere in the multi-employer health care system.\nCongress enacted the Coal Act to stop this\ndownward spiral. It wanted to ensure that a retired\nminer's benefits would be the responsibility of the\noperator that employed the miner, if possible, or if that\noperator was defunct, with one of that operator's related\npersons.\nSection 9701(c)(2) of the Coal Act effectuates\nthis policy. That section sets forth the related persons\nwho may be assigned responsibility for a miner's -- for an\noperator's employees. Under a straightforward reading of\nthat statutory language in section 9701(c)(2), the\ncommissioner may assign a miner to the direct successor in\ninterest of a signatory operator.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfson, even the dissenting\njudge in the court of appeals didn't buy that.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, it is true that he did not\nagree with us, Mr. Chief Justice, that the plain text of\nthe statute did not support our reading, but I have to\nrespectfully disagree with the dissenting judge because it\nis our position that it does.\nQUESTION: Well, it depends on the meaning you\ngive to the word described --\nMR. WOLFSON: It depends on --\nQUESTION: -- in section 9701(c)(2).\nMR. WOLFSON: It depends on the meaning that you\ngive to the word to describe. It also depends, Justice\nO'Connor, on the way one reads the subclauses of\n9701(c)(2).\nNow, our -- now --\nQUESTION: Well, you have to decide whether\ndescribed in -- somehow includes a reference to as opposed\nto a description of.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, there are two possible\napproaches to this question, Justice O'Connor. Certainly\none meaning of describe is to set out or to refer to, and\nthat is an established common usage of the meaning\ndescribe. It's a dictionary definition, and it's also\ntrue that the signatory operator is set out in and\nexpressed in each of the subclauses (1), (2), and (3).\nBut I would also submit -- and that is one theory under\nwhich we think that the plain text of the language\nsupports our position.\nI would also submit, however, that even if\ndescribed has a more kind of -- a different sense,\nnonetheless, a signatory operator may be found within\nthose -- those clauses (1), (2), and (3) because a\nsignatory operator is, by definition --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfson, can I interrupt you for\na second on -- just on the word described? Does the word\ndescribed have any meaning other than simply refer to --\ninsofar as it refers to any of the -- any of the entities\ndescribed in subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii)? Does it\ndo anything other than, in fact, identify each?\nMR. WOLFSON: It refers to -- well, it points\nback to --\nQUESTION: And it doesn't give you a definition,\nfor example, of a controlled group. It doesn't describe\nwhat a controlled group is. It doesn't describe what a\njoint venture is. All it does is say there are those\nanimals out there.\nMR. WOLFSON: That is right. Now -- but --\nand --\nQUESTION: So that the only meaning that can\nlogically be given to the word described in the context of\nthis statute is the one you give to it.\nMR. WOLFSON: That is -- that is our position,\nJustice Stevens.\nQUESTION: You think there's no -- no difference\nbetween a provision which says a member of the controlled\ngroup of corporations which includes the signatory\noperation, or a more detailed description, any other\nperson who is identified as having a partnership interest\nor joint venture with a signatory operator, et cetera, et\ncetera. You want to equate with those descriptions the\nwords signatory operator.\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: In the prologue. A person shall be\nconsidered to be a related person to a signatory operator\nif that person is -- and then it goes (i), (ii), (iii).\nAnd you say signatory operator is one of the persons\ndescribed in (A).\nQUESTION: I want to be very precise here\nbecause it's not necessary to refer to the prologue.\nAfter all, the -- the end, the flush paragraph says a\nrelated person shall also include a successor in interest\nof any person described in the clauses, not described in\nthe prologue. So, our -- so, it's not necessary to go to\nthe prologue. All that is necessary is to go to the\nclauses.\nAnd a signatory operator -- first of all, it is\nliterally described and set forth in those clauses.\nSecond, it is -- a signatory operator is a\nmember of a family that includes a signatory operator. In\nthat sense, even in a broader sense or a different sense\nof described, it is -- (A) is a member of the group that\n-- that includes (A), (B), and (C).\nNow, even if -- I think that I can concede that\nthe contrary reading is a permissible one of the statute\neven if picking up the statute and -- and reading it for\nthe first time without any reference to the context of the\nCoal Act. But --\nQUESTION: And it is -- as I understand it,\nthere hasn't been any court that has accepted your reading\nso that courts, whether the person was writing in dissent\nor in the majority, have rejected your reading as an\nimpermissible one. Am I right about that?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, they -- they, in the end,\nagreed with us that that -- Judge Murnaghan below and the\nD.C. Circuit in the R.G. Johnson case agreed with us in\nthe end that the statute should be given this meaning\nbecause --\nQUESTION: But not on the basis of what the text\nsays. In both cases they said Congress could not have\nmeant what they wrote, but as to the literal\ninterpretation of the statute, they all agreed -- they all\nrejected the notion that Congress had, in fact, enumerated\na successor of a signatory as -- within the -- the text of\nthe statute.\nMR. WOLFSON: That is correct.\nNow, it's our position, though, we disagree with\nthose holdings, and we -- and it's our position that it is\nat minimum a permissible reading of the statute.\nQUESTION: Do you know any other statute that's\never been interpreted that way where it, you know,\ndescribes certain people --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- in certain clauses in a later\nprovision and says any person described in such and it\nincludes a reference to signatory?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, of course --\nQUESTION: I would have thought there would be\nsomething, you know, at least close to this. Do you have\nany --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: What's the closest example you can\nthink of?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, I don't know about describe.\nI do know about include certainly is not -- is not a word\nthat is ordinarily meant to give an exclusionary reading;\nthat is, it is -- it's not -- include is -- is a non-\nexhaustive list. So, by saying it is a member of the\ncontrolled group that includes a signatory operator, it\ndoesn't necessarily mean -- it seems to me that the\nrespondents would essentially say a member of the\ncontrolled group of corporation, which includes the\nsignatory operator but not the signatory operator itself\nand --\nQUESTION: I believe what we'd like is a -- an\n-- a canon, for example, that says something like it is\npermissible for a court to accept an absurdly literal\nmeaning -- reading of a statute where necessary to avoid\nan absurd result.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, the -- the Court has done\nthat. I mean --\nQUESTION: Where? That's what we want. The\nexample where it's done that.\nMR. WOLFSON: Right. The Court has done that.\nThe Court has done that. I think --\nQUESTION: Heck, we've ignored the statute\nentirely to --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No, no.\nMR. WOLFSON: The Court has done that.\nQUESTION: -- seems like a better result --\nMR. WOLFSON: Just -- just last term in a case\ncalled Cornell Johnson --\nQUESTION: Did I write that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOLFSON: -- Cornell Johnson v. United\nStates, the Court was presented with two meanings of the\nword revoke. And -- and the Court -- and that was a\ncriminal case where the rule of lenity operates, of\ncourse. And the Court said, well, one meaning of the word\nrevoke, even though less common certainly and perhaps\nstrained, was the only one that could really make any\nsense out of the statute and the other one --\nQUESTION: Is that cited in your brief?\nMR. WOLFSON: It is cited in the brief, Your\nHonor.\nAnd it's -- and another case that comes to mind\nthat's similar is Field v. Mans, and that is a also\nrelevant case because there the Court was faced with kind\nof a negative pregnant argument; that is, well, here's one\nlanguage that appears in one part of the statute, but that\nlanguage that we would hope for doesn't appear here. And\nthe Court said --\nQUESTION: I'm more likely to think that\nCongress meant what it says, and -- and I -- why do you\nassert that it is -- it is unbelievable that Congress\nwould have meant what it said here?\nIt is certainly the case that the -- that the\npersons who would have been most affected by the\ninterpretation of this language that you -- you -- that\nyou propose would have been the very coal mine operators\nwho were lobbying Congress to get this thing passed. It\nseems to me not at all inexplicable that they were willing\nto have successors in interest of other people down the\nline held liable so long as they themselves would not be\nregarded as the successor in interest to somebody who\npreceded them, you know, saddling them with liability. I\ndon't find that a -- an unbelievable scenario at all. It\nseems to me a quite plausible one.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, several things.\nQUESTION: It -- it may not be a good policy\nresult.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, it's not just a -- a\nquestion of not being a good policy result. It's also is\nthis anything that Congress could have conceivably wanted\nto promote in the language of the act. And Congress was\naware, to the contrary of -- of the premise of your\nquestion, that it was exactly the problem of selling coal\noperations and then the original coal operator\ndisappearing and not being available --\nQUESTION: And Congress had -- had addressed\nthat problem, as I understand it, in just the way you feel\nwe should address it in -- in some of the bills in\npredecessor sessions of -- of the Congress in which they\nspecifically did include successors to the signatories.\nSo that it seems, if -- if you want to look at the -- the\nbroader record on what's believable and what isn't\nbelievable, at an earlier time, Congress tried, though it\nnot -- or some people in Congress tried, though they\ndidn't get their bills passed, to do just what you want us\nto say they did here. And yet, here they didn't.\nIsn't that a fact? Isn't that contrast\nsomething that we should take into consideration in\ndeciding what is credible or not?\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Souter, there's no\nevidence in the background to the adoption of the Coal Act\nthat Congress ever deliberately left behind --\nQUESTION: You mean this particular statute in\nthis session of Congress.\nMR. WOLFSON: This particular statute that\nCongress ever deliberately left behind a provision for --\nQUESTION: Sure. You're right.\nMR. WOLFSON: Right. And -- and there were many\ncontentious issues involved in the framing of the Coal\nAct. This was not one of them.\nAnd the entire Coal Commission which was in\nconsiderable disagreement about what the Congress should\ndo addressed the issue this way, and this unanimous on --\non their part. The ability of an employer to renege on\nits commitments to its retirees and dump liability on the\nfunds disrupts any effective long-range solution, and then\nthere is some further language, and then it says, the\ncommission believes that this situation is intolerable and\nmust be stopped.\nThere is no disagreement on that as being the --\nthe core problem or one of the core problems that led\nCongress to enact the Coal Act. And there's -- and\nthere's simply no -- I would submit there's simply no\nreason to think that Congress would have deliberately\nchosen to say we are going to place liability on these\nwhat I would call the nephew corporations, that is, the\nsuccessors in interest of the subsidiaries or the -- or\nthe corporate brothers and sisters and not on the direct\nsuccessors who were the very people to whom the original\ncoal operator had sold their operations.\nQUESTION: I'll give you a very good reason -- a\nvery good reason. It's the best we could do. They\ncouldn't have gotten the legislation otherwise. Sure, I\ncould design better legislation, but better designed\nlegislation is useless if it is not enacted. And the\nscenario I -- I give you is -- is one in which the coal\noperators did not want themselves to be tagged as\nsuccessor corporations to somebody who -- from whom they\nhad previously bought the assets.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: And they were the major players in --\nin this. Now --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, first of all, I mean, it's\nimportant to remember --\nQUESTION: That's why Congress did it. It's the\nbest they could do. It may not be the best statute in the\nworld, but it's a statute. It -- it did some good anyway.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, first, it's important to\nremember that the coal operators were getting very\nsignificant relief from the Coal Act, which is to say that\nthe -- the members of the Bituminous Coal -- Coal\nOperators Association who were at that time being forced\nto shoulder the costs of the -- of the -- the retirees of\nthe employers who had already gone out of business, they\nreceived a great deal of benefit from the Coal Act because\n-- because the Coal Act adopted the -- the approach of\ngoing back in time and reaching some of those people who\nhad disappeared, and the problem was that they had\ndisappeared and shifted -- disappeared and nobody had been\nthere to -- to pick up the -- the cost. And that -- that\nwas -- that was the very problem.\nQUESTION: No. You may be right. I mean, I --\nyou know, I can't prove my scenario. You can't prove your\nscenario. But it seems to me the burden is on the\nGovernment to give us a very good reason for ignoring what\nseems to me the -- the only reasonable reading of this\nlanguage. And -- and your reason for ignoring it is it is\ninconceivable that this is what Congress could have\nintended, and I think it is entirely conceivable. I'm --\nI'm not sure that that's the answer.\nQUESTION: You have to be very careful about\ngeneralizing what is conceivable for Congress.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, if there had\nbeen some indication in the legislative background that\nthis was a contentious issue and that there was attempt\nto, as the respondents have said, reclaim what was given\naway in the compromise, then -- then there might be some\nsubstance at that point. But there -- but there isn't.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: Horse trading has got to be explicit.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, it's -- it's not that you\nhave to be explicit. It's that one would certainly have\nthought this would have been an issue that had surfaced\nsomewhere in -- in the background of the Coal Act, and it\n-- it hadn't in this sense. I mean, all of the Coal\nCommission was -- was on board on this particular issue\nwhich is the -- the problem was that coal operators had\ngone out of business and that the -- and that the chain of\nsuccession hadn't been there.\nQUESTION: The oddity that you're relying on an\nillogic between the related people and their -- and their\nsuccessors count and not the successors of the -- the\noperator -- we're told that there has not been, in the\nhistory of the operation of this act, any case where\nliability has been imposed on a successor of -- of a\nrelated entity.\nMR. WOLFSON: That -- that's not right. I've\nchecked that. It's not in the record in this case, but\nthere have been instances in which Social Security has\nassigned liability to a successor of a related person.\nQUESTION: But you would -- not in many cases.\nWould you agree to that?\nMR. WOLFSON: I can't -- I can't state how many\nbecause there are 16,000 assignments and they are not\norganized this way.\nQUESTION: Well, my point is if this was a\nminimal likelihood, the other was a much more substantial\nrisk for the coal companies. One could easily see that\nthe coal companies want to protect themselves, and -- and\nthe other didn't mean a whole lot to anybody. So, it\nstayed in.\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Ginsburg, I think that to\nadopt that view, one -- one would have to know for certain\nthat related persons were necessarily not coal -- not also\ncoal companies. But there are coal companies that are\nalso related to other coal companies. There are -- I\nmean, that is a -- that is a -- a form of organization\nthat exists in the coal industry, which is that coal\ncompanies are -- and -- and the Coal Commission documented\nthis. That is, the coal -- the coal industry is\ncharacterized by interlocking networks of parents and\nsubsidiaries and corporate brother and sister\ncorporations, and they do that for some valid business\nreasons, to take advantage of limited liability laws, and\nother reasons as well involving closing -- the need to\nclose coal mines and start up elsewhere.\nBut the -- the point is it's not necessarily the\ncase that the -- the successors of the related persons are\nnot coal companies. There may be some that are not coal\ncompanies. Certainly they're not -- certainly if they're\nrelated persons, they will on some occasion include not\ncoal companies -- other than coal companies, but they also\nwill include coal companies.\nAnd Congress was addressing the situation more\ngenerally, and given that -- given the fact that Congress\nknew that coal companies were organized in -- in\ninterlocking corporate forms, I don't think I can agree\nthat these other people, these successors of related\ncompanies, would have been strangers to the legislative\nprocess that Congress would have found it easy to pick on,\nwhich I have to say is -- I'm not aware that the Court has\nadopted a theory of statutory construction which is that\nthe statute should be construed where -- you know, because\none people were the ins and the other the outs. And the\nonly reason that -- that we can make sense of the statute\nis that, you know, Congress decided that the outs were an\neasy target. I mean, that's -- that's --\nQUESTION: But there's something else. If --\nonce you concede that you -- on the text you lose, then if\nyou would agree that it would be a much larger class to\nstick in -- that is, successors of the -- the signatories\nwould be a much larger class than successors of related\ncompanies -- if you -- if you agree with that, then for\nthe Court to say we're going to cure this defect in the\nstatute by including a large group because there's a\nsmaller group that's there, usually when the Court is\nfaced with that choice, it will say, well, then -- then\nthe others, the small group, shouldn't have been included.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, first, I would not agree\nthat we lose on the plain language of the statute. I\nthink our reading is certainly a permissible one.\nBut to the contrary I would say Congress must\nhave included what I will hypothesize is the small group\nfor a legitimate policy reason, and it would be very odd\nthat Congress would not also include the large group who\nare more -- more directly -- at least more directly\nrelated to the problem at hand.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time, if\nI may.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Wolfson.\nMr. Buscemi, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA\nCOMBINED BENEFIT FUND, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. BUSCEMI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThere are several things that are not in dispute\nin this case, and I think it's worth reminding the Court\nof some of what they are.\nFirst of all, Congress did not say that the\nsuccessors of signatory operators are excluded from\nliability. Congress could have said that. It did not.\nSecondly, Congress did seek to assign as many\nCombined Fund beneficiaries as possible to specific\nsignatory operators, and to keep the unassigned\nbeneficiaries to an absolute minimum.\nThirdly, as Mr. Wolfson said, the coal industry\nwas characterized by shifting forms of corporate\norganization. This was one of the very problems that\nCongress was trying to address, that you had miner --\nmining companies selling assets, other mining companies\ncoming in apparently indistinguishable to the outside\nobserver. The mine looked the same. The people working\nthere were the same. The equipment was the same. And\nyet, the company that did own the assets at one time\nsought to walk away, and the other -- and the company\ncoming in said, well, I'm not responsible.\nFourthly, the statute includes very broad\nprovisions defining related person, far broader than the\nordinary circumstances in which parent and subsidiary\nliability for each other's debts or obligations would be\nfound.\nAnd finally, also undisputed is that it's not\nonly that the successors in interest of related persons\nare liable for the Combined Fund obligations, but it's\nalso that the successors in interest of the signatory\noperators themselves are liable for the individual\nemployer plans, section 9711, which involved very\nsubstantial obligations, and for the '92 plan. All of\nthat is undisputed.\nQUESTION: How -- how do we know that?\nMR. BUSCEMI: 9711(g)(1) explicitly says that\nsuccessors in interest to signatory operators are liable\nfor the individual employer plans and for the '92 plan.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure that helps you.\nQUESTION: Yes. Why doesn't it cut against you?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, I -- well, I readily\nacknowledge that you can make both arguments, but I think\nthe better argument is that it helps us because it adds to\nthe incongruity that our opponents are trying to argue for\nhere. It adds to the oddity of the result. It says that\nCongress wanted to make successors in interest of related\npersons liable for the Combined Fund. It wanted to make\nsuccessors in interest to the signatory operators liable\nfor the individual employer plan and for the '92 plan.\nAnd yet, Congress wanted to carve out a little segment\nthere for signatory -- successors of signatory operators\nand the Combined Fund.\nQUESTION: But it's not a little segment because\nif your opponent is right, everybody would have a motive\nto sell out right away. So, it would seem to me the whole\nindustry would get a benefit from -- from the other --\nfrom your opponent's reading of the statute.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well --\nQUESTION: Everybody should have just sold out\nright away.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, precisely, Your Honor. I\nmean, one of the things that I -- I'd like to point out is\nthat one of the enormous anomalies of what our opponents\nare arguing and what the court of appeals has held here is\nthat it essentially says that Congress deliberately put\ninto the statute the seeds of the statute's demise.\nCongress created a situation in which anyone who was -- on\nwhom liability was imposed under this statute could sell\nits asset to someone else, distribute the proceeds to its\nshareholders, dissolve the corporation, and the -- and the\nobligations would be terminated, and yet the operations of\nthe coal mine would continue on as is.\nQUESTION: Mr. Buscemi?\nQUESTION: But the answer to that --\nQUESTION: I don't follow that because isn't it\njust standard corporate law that if you sell out your\nassets and then quit business and there are liabilities\nout there, that your shareholders will be stuck with that\nliability up to the amount that they gained from the asset\nsale? Isn't that just standard corporate law?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, I suspect, Your Honor, that\nthe argument would be made that that's also not in the\nstatute and that, therefore, you can't import that into\nthe statute. No one has denied -- when we've said that\nthis is a potential result of the argument that's been\nmade here, no one has said it is not because the\nshareholders would take on that liability.\nQUESTION: But isn't that -- why would that\nState law be displaced? The standard provision for a\ncompany that sells its assets and then goes out of\nbusiness, for there to be shareholder liability.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, Your Honor, it may very well\nnot be displaced. But I could respond to that with the\nargument that nor should the successorship preexisting law\nbe displaced; that is, Congress acted against the\nbackground of preexisting law, both judicial\ninterpretation of the statute and the normal rules of\nstatutory construction written into title 1.\nQUESTION: If it -- if it did that, it wouldn't\nhave had to have the last -- the last clause of -- of\nsection 9701(c)(2), which says a related person shall also\ninclude a successor in interest. If it was appealing to\nthe general rule that successors in interest are always\ncovered, that would have been unnecessary, as well as the\nprovision that you mentioned earlier where -- where they\nspecifically said as to some matters -- as to some\nmatters, the successors in interest of -- of the -- of the\ncurrent coal companies would be -- would be covered.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, you're absolutely right,\nJustice Scalia, but that doesn't mean that Congress,\ntherefore, should be penalized for including some more\nspecific provisions. There's nothing that -- if Congress\nwanted to jettison title 1 and the normal rule that a\nsuccessor of a corporation is liable for that\ncorporation's obligations, then Congress should have said\nso.\nQUESTION: But that -- but that meaning would be\n-- make the successor equal to the -- the signatory\ncorporation, and that's not what you're urging, and that's\nnot what Mr. Wolfson suggested the statute means. You're\nsaying that the -- that the successor has successor\nsecondary liability. And then you're looking at the\ndictionary act. It says successors are the same. So, I\ndon't think that that 101 -- section 1 works for you\nbecause it would mean it's -- the successor's liability is\nnot a second category of liability, but it would be up\nthere in the top tier with the signer itself.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Your Honor, as a matter of\ndiscretion, the commissioner, in assigning the\nbeneficiaries, could elect which of several possible\nassigned persons it was going to make the assignment to,\nand I think that's all the commissioner has done here.\nThe -- the fact of the matter is if -- if we\nwant to do an absolute, literal reading of the language, I\nthink that the signatory operators are included there. I\nthink what the -- our opponents are doing is they're\nsaying we want it one way because we want the natural\nreading, but we don't want the really absolutely literal\nreading. This Court said --\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that also I don't\nunderstand because I'm not sure that the -- the -- when --\nwhen the title 1 defines successor, it is talking about\nthe person who buys assets. I thought it was talking\nabout and the business goes on. I thought that in the\nmeaning of that section, it arises from a merger or an\nacquisition and not an asset sale where the company goes\nout of business.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, that may be, and that's what\nour opponents argue, but that issue is not before the\nCourt right now. That issue was not reached by the court\nof appeals. The issue before the Court is whether this\nstatute can be read to cover successors of signatory\noperators or successors in interest of signatory\noperators, however that may be defined.\nAnd as I -- as I think the -- the Court has said\nin -- in other decisions, sometimes one needs to depart\nfrom the ordinary or most natural meaning in order to\nadopt a meaning that is consistent with the overall\nintention and policy of the statute, which is --\nQUESTION: That's Holy Trinity, isn't it?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, I think in Holy Trinity --\nQUESTION: Do we not have to go that far?\nMR. BUSCEMI: -- they were talking about the\nspirit of the statute, Your Honor. We weren't going that\nfar.\nQUESTION: Going back to your argument that the\n-- the other side's position is simply an -- an immediate\ninducement to sell, isn't one answer to that that if\nthat's what the -- the signatory does, it's going to be\nthe signatory's brother/sister corporations or parent\ncorporations that are, in effect, going to -- probably\ngoing to be penalized, as it were, with liability? And\nisn't that the reason why the inducement that you refer to\ndoes not operate in such an automatic way?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, not necessarily, Your Honor.\nIt would depend on what the nature of the corporate family\nis. Are there multiple corporations? Are there brother\nand sister --\nQUESTION: Well, it would depend on how -- yes,\nit would depend on how control is exerted, but presumably\nin some of these relationships, there would be a\nsufficient degree of control to exert that would -- would\nprevent this untoward result.\nMR. BUSCEMI: We're not saying it would happen\nin each and every case, Your Honor, but I think certainly\nyou -- you would see a lot of smaller companies using a\ntransaction like this in the future to escape this\nliability.\nQUESTION: Does the act impose potential\nliability on related persons of successors in interest to\nsignatory operators?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, Your Honor, again, it\ndoesn't specifically go down that line and I'm not aware\nof any case in which you've taken the -- the SSA has taken\na successor to a related person and then --\nQUESTION: Is that what Sigmon Coal is, one of\nthe respondents here? A related person to a successor to\na signatory?\nMR. BUSCEMI: Yes. It's a related person to\nJericol, which is the successor. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And you can't point to anything in\nthe act that would cover that.\nMR. BUSCEMI: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think\nthat if -- if Jericol is liable, then Sigmon would be\nliable as a related person to Jericol. I don't understand\nour opponents to be challenging that. I think they're\nonly challenging whether Jericol is liable.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Buscemi.\nMr. Woodrum.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WOODRUM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WOODRUM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBefore the Eastern Enterprises case came to this\nCourt in 1998, the lower courts were required to address\nthe question presented by Eastern as to whether its\nretirees should be assigned to its successor. The\ncommissioner responded in that case that the Coal Act did\nnot provide for successor liability. The commissioner's\nargument is set forth at pages 1a through 8a of the\nappendix to the amicus brief filed by R.G. Johnson.\nIn that case -- or in that argument, the\ncommissioner stated -- and I quote -- that Congress\nomitted successor companies from the Coal Act's assignment\nprovision cannot be attributed to mere legislative\ninadvertence or neglect. That particular sentence is at\npage 3a. And he further stated at that page, given that\nthe Coal Act refers to successors in several other Coal\nAct sections, Congress' omission of successors from both\nthe requirements of the assignment hierarchy and the\ndefinition of signatory operators was clearly intentional.\nWhile it is the case that the Secretary was\npromoting at that time a policy of nevertheless assigning\nbeneficiaries to successors where the operator was out of\nbusiness and there were no related persons, that was never\nrooted in any notion that there was something in the\ndefinition of related person that made the successor a\nrelated person. It was simply a manifestation of the\ncommissioner's assumption of what Congress would have\nwanted the commissioner to do.\nQUESTION: What do you think the strongest\npolicy reason would be for imposing liabilities on\nsuccessors in interest to related parties but not on\nsuccessors in interest to signatory operators?\nMR. WOODRUM: I don't know that there is any\npolicy reason for imposing them on --\nQUESTION: Why would Congress make that choice?\nMR. WOODRUM: I think Congress made that choice\nbecause, as Justice Scalia has -- has noted, this was a\nstatute that came -- came together very quickly under\ngreat pressure. It was worked out by a number of groups.\nThey were facing a strike at the end of the year, and they\nhad had a veto of the earlier statute by President Bush\nin, I believe it was, April -- March or April, and they\nwere left with a short period of time to get it done, and\nthey simply got it done. Those words appear there. What\nthey mean is not before the Court. The words successor in\ninterest of related persons.\nQUESTION: So, if it's inadvertent -- if it's\ninadvertent, I think we should try, as hard as possible,\nto get the interpretation they would have wanted. You\nthink it's just inadvertent.\nMR. WOODRUM: I don't know, Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: What other possible explanation could\nthere be?\nMR. WOODRUM: Well --\nQUESTION: It makes no sense. You agree to\nthat.\nMR. WOODRUM: It -- it --\nQUESTION: And so, what possible explanation\ncould there be other than a legislative mistake?\nMR. WOODRUM: The -- the -- one possible reason\nwhy that is there is that it was never intended to have\nthe broad meaning which the commissioner has given it,\nwhich is --\nQUESTION: I know, but I mean, why? What --\nwhat -- you said there is no reason that you can think of.\nI can think of none. Any policy it could serve to have\nthe -- the nephews related but not the direct descendant\nmakes no sense to me, and you can't make any sense out of\nit either, I -- I gather.\nNow, that being so, what -- why -- why was it\nwritten that way? And we can think of one answer. It was\ninadvertent. Is there any other possibility?\nMR. WOODRUM: The -- I don't know why it's\nthere. We have no legislative history as to why that\nphrase was there.\nQUESTION: Well, we do have some legislative\nhistory.\nQUESTION: We're asking you to speculate. If\nthere's no conceivable reason, I'm -- I'm inclined to say,\nyes, maybe -- you know, maybe it was a mistake --\nMR. WOODRUM: Well --\nQUESTION: -- and we should -- we should regard\nit as a scrivener's error. You -- you cannot conceive of\nany reason, is that what you're saying, why -- why that --\nwhy it came out that way?\nMR. WOODRUM: I think it came out that way\nbecause when you look at the parallelism of the earlier\ndraft of the statute, there had been provisions that were\nparallel. Although they referred to successor, there was\na -- in the -- in the immediately earlier draft that's\nappended to -- again, to the R.G. Johnson amicus brief,\nthere was a provision that did define a -- a signatory\noperator to include a successor, which is --\nQUESTION: Which would make you think that this\nwas intentional, but you -- you tell us --\nMR. WOODRUM: Exactly.\nQUESTION: You tell us you cannot conceive of\nany reason why somebody would do that intentionally.\nMR. WOODRUM: To put in -- Justice Breyer's\nquestion was why might there be a reference to successor\nin interest of a related person and not such a reference\nto --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WOODRUM: -- a successor in interest of the\ndirect signatory. And that is because between the -- the\ncouple of days between the draft that had successor\nliability for signatory operators and the enactment, the\nversion that actually was hammered out and agreed to, the\nsuccessor language was ripped out of the definition of\nsuccessor -- of signatory operator. It seems clear there\nthat there was a --\nQUESTION: Well, was it ripped out or was it\nnever put in?\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, it was --\nQUESTION: In this particular bill, it was never\nput in.\nMR. WOODRUM: It was not put in.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. WOODRUM: It was the from the earlier draft.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, they didn't have to do any\nripping to the text with which they started here.\nMR. WOODRUM: Not this text, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Let me just go one step further than\nJustice Scalia's question and -- and ask you this. I -- I\ntake it it's -- it's correct that at no time in this\nlitigation has your side either represented to the court\nor tried to offer any evidence to any court that this was\nthe result of a -- in effect, a deliberate political\nagreement. You know, we'll withdraw our opposition if\nyou'll take that out kind of a agreement.\nMR. WOODRUM: No. We've not taken the position\nthat there was a -- a -- some sort of a tradeoff of taking\nit out of the one section and yet leaving it in the other.\nQUESTION: Then that really does leave it as\nkind of unexplained inadvertence. I mean, that's the only\nway we can look at it, isn't it?\nMR. WOODRUM: It would be -- if it's unexplained\ninadvertence, it would be in leaving in language that\nspeaks to successor in interest of the related person.\nQUESTION: Oh, I see. It is a mistake, but you\ndon't know which mistake it is, whether it is --\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, no, I think --\nQUESTION: -- it is failing to include the --\nthe original owners or including the -- the later --\nMR. WOODRUM: No. It -- it would seem clear --\nQUESTION: So, maybe we should ignore the later\nlanguage instead of ignoring this language. That's a real\npuzzlement which language we should ignore.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOODRUM: The -- the problem is that -- and\nthat's why the courts tend to enforce the plain language\nof the statute as written is because we don't know what\nhappens in those discussions, in those negotiations that\nlead to the enactment.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not saying, are you,\nthat you know for a fact that there was not this -- this\nkind of motive, to simply save the liability of the\ninitial coal owners? You -- you don't know for a fact\nthat that was not why it was eliminated, do you?\nMR. WOODRUM: There is nothing in the record\nthat speaks to it one way or the other.\nQUESTION: Well, that isn't quite true. I know\nJustice Scalia won't look to this part of the record, but\nthere is legislative history that to me strongly suggests\nthere was no such political deal. You have Senators\nWallop and Senator Rockefeller get up and they say this\ndoes cover the successor in interest. In my experience,\nwhenever one Senator says such a thing and that's actually\na contested issue, the other side gets a different Senator\nto get up and say the opposite. So -- so, I would say\nthat it's very contrary to any situation of which I'm\naware in which there was a real political fight.\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, let me explain each of those\n-- those two comments.\nFirst of all, Senator Rockefeller put some\ncomments into the record on many different points, and so\nfar there have been three circuit courts that have\ndeclined to attribute or -- or to give plain language the\nmeaning that -- that Senator Rockefeller said it should\nhave on three other issues, in addition to this particular\nissue. Those cases are noted in -- in our brief.\nSecondly, as far as Senator Wallop's comment is\nconcerned, it appears that it was simply added in as a\ntechnical explanation. I don't think that --\nQUESTION: I agree. I'm just saying that the\nfact that they're there is evidence that what you're\nsaying is completely true, that this was not a deal. If\nthat's evidence of that, I'm not saying how strong it is\nBut my -- my -- what I'd actually like to ask\nyou is, if in fact it's inadvertent or we don't know, then\nwhy don't we just do this? It says the term signatory\noperator means a person who is a signatory operator. The\nfirst sentence of the U.S. Code, just after it defines\nlunatic and idiot --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- says that the word person includes\ncorporations. Then section 5 says the word company -- and\nit includes corporations, companies, associations. The\nword company or association, when used in reference to a\ncorporation shall be deemed to embrace the word successors\nand assigns as if the words successors and assigns, or\nwords of similar import, were expressed. And it tells us\nto read statutes that way unless the context indicates\notherwise.\nVery well. What in here indicates otherwise?\nIsn't that the issue? The issue is not the meaning of the\n-- of whether 1, 2, and 3 include assigns. The issue is\nwhether 1, 2, and 3 preclude the ordinary meaning in the\npreceding sentence of person to include the successors of\na corporation.\nMR. WOODRUM: Justice Breyer, the -- the title 1\ndictionary act by its terms is to be applied when there is\nno evidence --\nQUESTION: That's right.\nMR. WOODRUM: -- in the statute.\nQUESTION: That's exactly --\nMR. WOODRUM: We have ample evidence in this\nstatute that Congress specifically considered both\nquestions of successor and successors in interest because\nthose terms are used throughout the statute. For example,\nat section 9711(g), the term, last signatory operator, is\ndefined to include successor in interest. And the\ninteresting thing about --\nQUESTION: But what you're doing right this\nminute, you see, which is fine, which I'll let you do and\nI'd like you to do, but note that what you're doing is not\naddressing, as I think you're quite right, whether you can\nshoehorn successors into paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, which is\npretty tough to do. Rather, you're addressing a different\nquestion of whether the context shows that the ordinary\ndictionary act definition should not apply to a preceding\nsentence. Now, noting that that's what you're doing, I'd\nbe happy to have you do it.\nQUESTION: May I --\nQUESTION: He's doing that because you asked him\nthe question.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, don't -- don't blame it on\nhim.\nQUESTION: May I follow up on that --\nQUESTION: Why don't we give him a chance to\nanswer?\nQUESTION: -- by asking of my role in saying\nthat the dictionary act -- the use of the word successor\nin the dictionary act is not the use of the word -- if\nJustice Breyer was right that successor means successor,\nbut I thought successor, in the meaning of the dictionary\nact, was not the kind of successor that we're dealing with\nhere -- that is, an asset sale -- but was the successor\ncorporation when two corporations merge, when one\ncorporation acquires another. And if that's so, then the\ndictionary act would not touch at all the asset sale\nsuccessor.\nMR. WOODRUM: Exactly, Judge Ginsburg, and\nthat's the --\nQUESTION: Why is that? Because what the --\nwhat it says is, literally, pretend that the word\nsuccessor appears in the statute that you're reading.\nOkay, I'll pretend it. So, I now read the word signatory\noperator means a company and its successors. What in\nthere says that I can't read this as applying to an asset\nsale as well as any other kind of transfer?\nMR. WOODRUM: Again, the dictionary act is of\ngeneral background and relevance to the Court to provide\nassistance where Congress hasn't spoken to the issue. But\ngoing back, at my peril, to section 9711(g), which does\nhave the words you're looking for or I should say that the\ncommissioner is looking for in section 9701(c)(2), the\ninteresting thing about section 9711(g), it applies to\ndifferent but brother plans, shall we say, or comparable\nplans that were also part of this legislation. And\nsection 9711(g) says, for purposes of these plans, it\nshall -- the last signatory operator shall include a\nsuccessor in interest.\nQUESTION: May I just --\nMR. WOODRUM: And that's the only rule. It\nsays, rules for purposes of these plans, and that is the\n-- the words that go to successor in interest and a\nsubpart that goes to post-enactment successors is the only\nspecial rule there, which has to carry the implication --\nQUESTION: Let me just --\nMR. WOODRUM: -- that there was some certainty\nto not having that term appear in section 9701(c)(2).\nQUESTION: May I just clarify one point in\nresponse to your answer to Justice Ginsburg? You do\nagree, do you not, that even though this sale was an asset\nsale, that we are dealing with a successor in interest of\na signatory here, within the meaning of 9701(c)?\nMR. WOODRUM: As the commissioner has defined\nit, that issue as to whether --\nQUESTION: So, the term successor, at least in\nthis statute, includes a purchaser at an asset sale as\nwell as a purchaser of stock.\nMR. WOODRUM: No, Your Honor, it doesn't\nnecessarily include that. That's the way the commissioner\n-- that's the position the commissioner has taken.\nQUESTION: But haven't you conceded that you are\na -- your client is a successor in interest of a signatory\noperator?\nMR. WOODRUM: As -- as the commissioner has --\nQUESTION: I didn't think you challenged that.\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, the issue is not before the\nCourt. That issue is reserved below. If the -- if the\nCourt concludes that a successor in interest to a\nsignatory operator is covered, then we would be remanded\nback to determine whether we, as an asset purchaser, are\nin fact a successor in interest as that term is used.\nQUESTION: But there are -- there are statutes\nthat define successor in interest to include a kind of an\nasset sale. You -- successor in interest can mean\ndifferent things in different statutes.\nMR. WOODRUM: Exactly, Judge Ginsburg, and\nthat's why it would be remanded for further\ndeterminations, although the Williams Mountain court, the\nD.C. -- the District of Columbia Circuit several months\nago in the case of Williams Mountain did define that term\nto -- they didn't give it a specific definition, but they\nsaid it's somewhere between a tax code successor and the\nBlack's Law Dictionary common law successor, which does\nnot include asset purchasers.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Woodrum, it seems to me you\ncannot fairly have it both ways. You can either concede\nthat a successor within the meaning of this act includes\nan asset purchaser and then make the argument that using\nthe dictionary act wouldn't -- wouldn't produce a sensible\nstatute anyway because, under the dictionary act,\nsuccessor would not normally be interpreted to include an\nasset purchaser.\nNow, you can make that argument if you concede\nthat under this legislation, successor does include an\nasset purchaser. But -- but if you are not willing to\nconcede that point, then it seems to me you have to\nabandon the argument that the dictionary act makes no\nsense here. It may well make sense if you accept your\ndefinition of successor.\nMR. WOODRUM: We would not rely on the\ndictionary act as having any relevance on remand. The\ndictionary act has no applicability to the statute because\nthe statute itself deals with successor liability and\nsuccessor in interest liability. This is not a concept\nthat Congress did not have in mind and -- and therefore\nleft to the dictionary act --\nQUESTION: Except that it deals with successor\nliability in a way that you've been unable to explain\nmakes any sense whatsoever, that there's no reason to\nimpose successor liability on the successor of a related\nperson, while not imposing it on a successor of a\nsignatory.\nMR. WOODRUM: It -- the statute does not impose\nliability on successors.\nQUESTION: Successors of related persons.\nMR. WOODRUM: No, sir. It -- it speaks to\nsuccessors in interest, which is where some of the\ndifficulty in this case arises because the commissioner\nhas just lumped the two together as though they are the\nsame. So, when we look at the language of the statute,\neven under the -- the reading that the -- that the\ncommissioner has attempted to expand to --\nQUESTION: You're suggesting there's a\ndifference between successor in interest and successor.\nMR. WOODRUM: Yes, I believe there is a\ndifference.\nQUESTION: And what is the difference?\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, typically if you look at the\nBlack's Law Dictionary or the common law application of\nsuccessor in interest, it is statutory succession, merger,\nname change successors, and so forth. And in fact, at one\npoint in time, the commissioner even had adopted that\ndefinition.\nQUESTION: I see, but granting that -- assume it\nonly refers to a limited class. It still -- you still\nhave failed to explain whatever that class of successor in\ninterest includes, why should it apply to successors of\nrelated persons and not apply to successors of\nsignatories. I don't think you've given us a reason for\nthat.\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, it -- it really -- I don't\nknow the reason for that. Congress wrote the act that\nway. That's the way it came out. It doesn't cause any\nloss of benefits. It doesn't provide any harm, and\nwhatever the result of that is, it wouldn't be -- even if\nthere were some oddity about it, it wouldn't serve as a\nbasis to, if you will, bootstrap liability onto, as one of\nthe Justices indicated before -- I believe it was Justice\nGinsburg -- that the majority, if not the entirety, of the\noperators that are actually affected by this. There --\nother than the -- the notation this morning by the\nSolicitor General, there -- we weren't aware that the\ncommissioner had ever made an assignment of liability.\nQUESTION: But you're not contesting that that\nstatement in -- in your brief was inaccurate.\nQUESTION: But that merely emphasizes -- that\nmerely emphasizes the incongruity of the statute. If\nthere -- it didn't serve a function there, why would they\ntake the trouble to put it in and not put it in for\nsignatories? It just -- it just doesn't make any sense at\nall. In fact, it -- it's worse. It's perverse if your\nview is correct.\nMR. WOODRUM: I don't think so, with all due\nrespect, because what -- what happened or what is a\nplausible scenario is that we have 50 years of\nretroactivity in commercial transactions that have\noccurred in the coal industry. Nobody has disputed that\nthis is a manner of doing business in the coal business,\nto buy and sell assets. So, the focus was to avoid the\npossibility by putting language in the definition of\nsignatory operator that might enable -- might inject\nconfusion or interpretation by -- by the commissioner, by\nthe Combined Fund, or even by the courts, that that\nsignatory operator meant anything other than the entity\nthat signed the agreement. And by taking -- by ensuring\nthat there is nothing in this act that opens that up, then\nthere -- it is clear that what liability has been imposed\ngoes on the signatory operators and the other operators\naren't going -- such as Jericol in this case, aren't going\nto be held responsible for beneficiaries they never\nemployed based on transactions that happened 20 or 30\nyears ago, which were very common.\nQUESTION: But if I understand the definition of\nrelated persons, it could cover people not even in the\ncoal business at all and their successors in interest.\nMR. WOODRUM: It does, but the thing about that\ndefinition is and the reason it has some logic to\nexpanding liability is it does encompass entities that\nhave an economic connection with the employer.\nQUESTION: I do -- I do have one question on --\non the basic statutory point, the shoehorning question of\nwhether or not Shackleford is -- is described in the\nstatute. Was Shackleford a member of the -- of a\ncontrolled group of corporations?\nMR. WOODRUM: No, it was not. It was a family-\nowned company. It had no related persons.\nQUESTION: So, then Roman I would not apply.\nMR. WOODRUM: That's correct. There are --\nQUESTION: Because it seemed to me if\nShackleford had been a member of a controlled group of\ncorporations, then it might have been included in the\ncontrolled group and then it might have been described.\nMR. WOODRUM: Which is the problem with the\ncommissioner's linguistic gymnastics in trying to say that\nthe -- the commissioner's definition in that case would\nbasically mean that there's always a control group because\none is always related to himself. So, we always have a\ngroup of one. But -- but linguistically that can't really\nbe the case.\nQUESTION: But if it had been a member of a\ncontrolled group, not a group of one, that argument would\nhave been slightly more plausible, it seems to me.\nMR. WOODRUM: I don't think it would be any more\nplausible --\nQUESTION: You would still be -- you would still\nbe related to yourself.\nMR. WOODRUM: Exactly. You'd still -- and the\ninteresting thing about that argument, not to -- not to\nbelabor it, but under that argument, you would always make\nan assignment -- the commissioner would always make an\nassignment to a successor who never employed the\nindividuals even though the act's assignment criteria at\n9706 says you make assignments to employers under certain\n-- employers that employed or signatory operators that\nemployed the miners in the coal industry. Under that\ninterpretation, you would first go to a successor, even\nthough there may be other employers out there who --\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. WOODRUM: -- who actually employed the\nminer.\nQUESTION: When I talk about Shackleford, I mean\nthe first Shackleford. Shackleford, the seller, was never\na member of a controlled group.\nMR. WOODRUM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Because if it had been, I think the\ncommissioner would have had a better argument, and it\nwould have still the problem of being related to yourself.\nI understand.\nMR. WOODRUM: We would still have all the\nlinguistic problems with -- with describing --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think all because it is\n-- the word there is include in 1. And so, that -- you're\ndescribing somebody who's included within a controlling\ngroup. But if it's not applicable, then I don't need to\n-- I don't think we need to pursue it.\nMR. WOODRUM: Well, it's not applicable here. I\n-- I think that we'd still have a problem with -- the\nbasic problem that some of these clauses, for example,\nrefer to limited partners. They're included. Yet, it's\nquite clear that they're not to have liability. So, the\nfact that they're named or mentioned would still lead you\nto an unworkability with that kind of definition. And it\nalso ignores the -- the prior draft of the legislation\nwhich had those very words in -- in the draft, and they\ndidn't appear in the enacted version, as well as the\ninconsistency with the 9711 language, which does include\nthat language.\nQUESTION: I know you've discounted the\nsignificance of the legislative history, the Senator's\ncomment and so forth. If there had been a committee\nreport, which clearly stated that the drafters of the\ncommittee report thought that they picked up successors to\nthe signatory, would you say that statute should control\nor the committee report should control?\nMR. WOODRUM: The -- the jurisprudence of this\nCourt is that the language of the statute controls when\nit's clear.\nQUESTION: Even if it's perfectly clear Congress\nintended otherwise.\nMR. WOODRUM: Yes. Unless -- if there were a --\nsome kind of a -- a very unusual situation, a question of\na scrivener's error or something, then -- then perhaps it\nwould -- it would be relevant. But, of course, there were\nno reports at all on --\nQUESTION: I guess the answer is that the only\nway it can be perfectly clear that Congress intended\notherwise is for both houses of Congress, not a single\ncommittee of one Congress, to have enacted the provision.\nMR. WOODRUM: Exactly.\nQUESTION: That would make it perfectly clear\nthat both houses intended otherwise.\nQUESTION: It would make it perfectly clear to\nJustice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOODRUM: It -- it makes -- it makes for a\n-- a rational jurisprudence when one tends to enforce the\n-- the language that's actually in the statute.\nAnd let me point out that what we're talking\nabout here is retroactive liability. This liability is\ngrounded in transactions that occurred decades before\nenactment of this act.\nQUESTION: That's what makes it so anomalous to\nimpose successor liability on successors of related\npersons who don't have anything to do with the coal\nindustry. That's what -- the troubling thing to me is the\nextent of the -- the successor liability that is included\nwithin the statute, and then it does not include people\nwho are still in the coal business.\nMR. WOODRUM: But if -- but if that question\ncomes to the Court, the Court will have to deal with that\nquestion as to whether that is liability that may be\nenforced and imposed on such distantly related entities\nfor historic transactions under the same criteria that the\nCourt used, for example, in the Eastern Enterprises case.\nQUESTION: Of course, these people were distant\nnot only from the transactions in question but also from\nthe negotiations that produced the statute.\nMR. WOODRUM: Exactly.\nQUESTION: And -- and that may well be the\nexplanation of why they got stuck.\nMR. WOODRUM: Yes, if they weren't there to\nrepresent their interests, then -- and they likely weren't\nsince, I don't think, anybody that is that distant --\ndistantly related would have even been aware that there\nwas a problem in funding benefits.\nBut to -- to reflect back on the question of\nsort of the clear language and this Court's view of how\nclear Congress must be in enacting these statutes, as the\nCourt said in Lansgraf, since the early days of this\nCourt, we have declined to give retro effect --\nretroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights\nunless Congress made clear its intent. Requiring clear\nintent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively\nconsidered the potential unfairness of retroactive\napplication and determined that it is an acceptable price\nto pay for the countervailing benefits.\nAnd this -- this liability is all retroactive,\nand we should be looking for a very clear expression of\ncongressional intent to assign it to successors or\nsuccessor in interest before the commissioner may, in\neffect, impose large, what are now administrative\nobligations --\nQUESTION: But, of course, here there's no doubt\nabout the fact that whoever is covered -- it was intended\nto be -- the statute was intended to have retroactive\neffect.\nMR. WOODRUM: Yes.\nQUESTION: Which is, of course, what Lansgraf\nwas --\nMR. WOODRUM: It is -- it is retroactive to\neveryone that is covered.\nThe final point is that if this language is\nenforced as written, the benefits are going to be provided\nto the Shackleford beneficiaries on a pro rata basis by\nall the operators who are assigned liability, including\nJericol, to the extent it otherwise has valid liability\nfor people that it did employ. And Congress specifically\nmade available the interest from the Abandoned Mine Land\nTrust Fund to subsidize that liability, and to date all of\nthat liability that -- for the orphan beneficiaries who\nhave no -- have no employer or related person still in\nbusiness has been funded by the interest that's been made\navailable. And there has been no premium assessed on the\nother operators to pay for the unassigned beneficiaries or\nthese orphan beneficiaries' health care. So, Congress not\nonly made clear in the way it laid out who's to receive\nthe liability, but it also provided sources of funding and\nguarantees so that those miners, those retirees who have\nno last employer still in business will receive their\nbenefits --\nQUESTION: And you say that funding has been\nadequate thus far.\nMR. WOODRUM: Yes, Your Honor. That -- there\nhas never been a call on the assigned operators to pay any\npro rata premium towards the payment of unassigned\nbeneficiaries' health care.\nFurther questions? I'll --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Woodrum.\nMr. Wolfson, you have half a minute remaining.\nDon't use it all in one --\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR.
