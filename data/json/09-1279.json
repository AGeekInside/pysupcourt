        "content": "(10:18 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 09-1279, Federal\nCommunications Commission v. AT&T, Inc.\nMr. Yang.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals has held that FOIA's\nstatutory protection for personal privacy in\nExemption 7(C) extends beyond the privacy of individuals\nand protects the so-called personal privacy of\ncorporations. That holding is inconsistent with the\ntext of Exemption 7(C), FOIA's broader context, and the\nstatute's drafting history, and would lead to anomalous\nresults.\nThe word \"personal,\" standing alone, refers\nto individual -- an individual human being. \"Privacy,\"\nstanding alone, and even more so in the context of the\nphrase \"invasion of privacy,\" invokes purely individual\nconcepts. And the sum of those terms -- that is, the\nstatutory phrase used in FOIA, \"personal privacy\" -- is\ngreater than the sum of its parts. It's long been well\nsettled that corporations have no personal privacy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that there are\ncontexts in the law in which the word \"personal\" is used\nto refer to a corporation? For example, you could refer\nto personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't\nyou?\nMR. YANG: There are -- the term \"personal\"\nis sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal\njurisdiction is one of those. It is the modern, shorter\nterm of art for jurisdiction in personam and reflects a\ndistinction drawn still in the law between cases brought\nin personam and cases brought in rem.\nThat -- the evolution of that term in the\nlaw as a term of art does not reflect what the ordinary\nmeaning of \"personal\" is. It's just the same as the\nterm \"personal property,\" which also invokes\nlong-established traditional distinctions between\nproperty that could be recovered in rem or in real\nactions versus property that might be recovered in\nactions in personam.\nSo -- and, in fact, I think it -- it's\nimportant to note that there are -- although maybe there\nare some instances that -- I think there's one instance\nthat AT&T cites in its brief. Nothing -- it never cited\nany use of the term \"personal\" to mean corporate or\npertaining to a corporation. And when -- when you -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about\npersonal appearances?\nMR. YANG: A personal appearance, I think\nthat -- that supports our position as well. If you're\nmaking a personal appearance, it's not something that a\ncorporation does. A corporation is a -- a legal\nconstruct. It doesn't exist as a thing that can make an\nappearance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in ordinary speech,\nthe term \"personal\" is not -- the term \"person\" is not\nused to refer to a corporation. That's -- that's\nlegalese. But in -- but since the -- the Administrative\nProcedure Act defines a person to include a corporation,\nwhy is it relevant here or dispositive here to look to\nthe ordinary usage of term \"personal\" as opposed to the\nway it's -- it's used in the law? And in the law, it is\nsometimes used to refer to a corporation.\nMR. YANG: Well, I think that -- that point\nactually reinforces our position, because although\n\"person\" is used in certain legal contexts to refer\nto artificial persons and corporations and the like,\n\"personal\" is not.\nAnd \"personal,\" as we explain in our brief,\nis not simply a grammatical alteration, an inflection of\nthe term \"person.\" It has existed in its own right\nsince the late 1300s and has developed meaning that is\nunique to the term \"personal,\" which -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, can we go back\nfirst to this -- the request came in and, as I\nunderstand it, the Commission said there are two\nexemptions: The one for trade secrets, commercial,\nfinancial confidential information; and then there was\none with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee.\nMR. YANG: Correct. There was an additional\nexemption, Exemption 5, which protected internal\ngovernment communications. But -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does the -- does the\nCommission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and\ndecide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee,\nas distinguished from the corporation?\nMR. YANG: How does it do that?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. YANG: Well, I -- I don't think the\ntouchstone is necessarily embarrassment. What the\ngovernment does, following this Court's decision in\nReporters Committee, is tries to determine whether there\nis a personal privacy interest about individuals, and\nthat is information that pertains to particular\nindividuals.\nFor instance, in this Court's decision in\nDOD v. FLRA, the Court explained that, although an\nagency released the name of individuals, it could\nproperly withhold the addresses, the home addresses, of\nthose individuals, even though that might be publicly\navailable in phone books, because individuals have at\nleast some small personal privacy interest in that.\nSo what the agency will do is try to\nidentify information pertaining to individuals and then\nwill conduct -- if there is certain information, will\ntry to conduct a balancing to determine whether there is\na public interest in disclosure, that is, whether\nrevealing this would disclose information against the\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in that instance,\ndoes the corporation have standing to raise that\nobjection on the employee's behalf?\nMR. YANG: Well, I think the corporation to\nthe -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which is\nwhat we have here, where the corporation is alleging\nthat the government's decision-making process is\narbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to\nresist the disclosure of documents. If you're using\nstanding kind of like a Fourth Amendment concept of\nstanding, I don't think that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as an administrative\nmatter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on\nbehalf of its employees?\nMR. YANG: It can make an objection on its\nown behalf, which is to say that the government has not\nproperly gone through the decision-making process by\nnot -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. That's the\nnext -- that was going to be my next question: So the\ncorporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?\nMR. YANG: It's actually -- let me take a\nstep back. FOIA actions are actions which seek to\nincrease the amount of documents that the government has\nreleased pursuant to a FOIA request.\nWe have also reverse FOIA actions, which are\nactions under the APA and here under the Hobbs Act's\nreview provisions, that would give the court of appeals\njurisdiction. When there's a reverse FOIA action, the\nclaim is that the agency's final agency action is\nsomehow arbitrary, capricious, and not -- or contrary to\nlaw. And so in this case, the FCC has certain\nregulations which govern its processing of FOIA\nrequests. And AT&T's claim, as we understand it, is\nthat the FCC did not comply with its regulations, and,\ntherefore, its decision was arbitrary capricious because\nits regulations required that it consider the personal\nprivacy interest of individuals.\nAnd I should note that, with respect to\nExemption 6 or Exemption 7(C), the government itself\ninvokes personal privacy of individuals. That's what we\ndo when we process FOIA requests, because individuals\nnormally don't get any notice that there has been a FOIA\nrequest. The government simply processes it and asserts\nthose rights, in a sense that they're rights, asserts\nthose interests on behalf of corporations -- on behalf\nof individuals.\nGoing back to the text of the statute, the\nterm \"privacy,\" and particularly an invasion of privacy,\ninvokes concepts that back to Warren and Brandeis's\nright of privacy, the -- their article which explained\nthat or identified in the law certain human dignitary\ninterests that they gave the label \"privacy.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, privacy\ncertainly isn't as limited as you argue \"person,\"\n\"personal,\" is. Corporations have private property.\nThey have private documents. The concept certainly\napplies in the corporate context as it does in the\nindividual.\nMR. YANG: I think the term \"privacy,\" its\nordinary meaning, not the only meaning but the ordinary\nand the commonly used meaning, does invoke individual\nconcepts. When corporations or other entities are at\nissue, normally the more appropriate word would be\n\"confidentiality\" or \"secrecy.\" Those concepts -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have\nconfidential property or secret property. You have\nprivate property.\nMR. YANG: Well, true. But it's is not\nprivacy. When we're talking about the right of privacy,\nthose -- that word we think -- again going back to\nWarren and Brandeis and up through the fifties and\nsixties when Prosser was elaborating the law of torts in\nhis groundbreaking article on privacy, those concepts\napply only to individuals, and particularly when you\ncombine the terms.\nI mean, the Restatement makes clear, and\nback to Prosser it was clear, that corporations have no\nright of personal privacy. So when Congress in 1974 was\nenacting Exemption 7(C), there would have been no basis\nfor it to conclude that the rights that it was\nconferring through the phrase \"personal privacy\" would\nconfer rights not -- beyond individuals, to\ncorporations, and by necessarily implication, if AT&T is\ncorrect, foreign governments, State governments, local\ngovernments. There's no predicate for those types of\nentities having personal privacy in the law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Our cases assert, do they\nnot, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly\nconstrued?\nMR. YANG: There are cases -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said that on a\nnumber of cases.\nMR. YANG: In certain contexts, this Court\nhas indicated that exceptions are to be narrowly\nconstrued. We think that, when read in context, those\ncases and other cases of this Court explain that FOIA's\nexemptions are to be given meaningful reach, because\nwhat Congress was trying to do in FOIA -- and this is\nsomewhat against our interest in this case, and we\nexplain it more fully in our brief in Milner, which is\ncurrently pending to the Court -- what Congress was\ntrying to do in FOIA was to establish a general\nprinciple of disclosure, but in the exemptions it\nidentified very important interests that warranted an\nexception from those general rules. And to narrowly\nconstrue the exception, we think, would distort rather\nthan advance congressional purpose in enacting FOIA.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress had used\nthe phrase \"privacy of a person,\" \"privacy of any\nperson.\" Would you make the same argument?\nMR. YANG: Our argument would be a little\ndifferent, particularly in the context of Exemptions 6\nand 7(C), where the phrase would be \"an invasion of\nprivacy of any person.\"\nWe think, particularly when we're talking\nabout invasions of privacy, even though a corporation\nmight have a broader definitional meaning in context,\nCongress in that case would still, we think, be\nreferring to individuals. But, of course, that's not\nthis case. That would make it a little bit more\ndifficult. We think we would probably still prevail on\nthat reading. But -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Privacy\nAct? The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals,\nhuman individuals -\nMR. YANG: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not artificial beings.\nBut it uses the words \"individual privacy\" -\nMR. YANG: Well, it actually uses both\nphrases. It uses, as we explain in our brief, the\nphrase \"personal privacy\" to explain that that's what\nthe Act was protecting. And then within the operative\nportions of the Act, it uses \"individual,\" but it does\nso for a very specific reason. Congress was intending\nto protect a subset of individuals, and it defined the\nterm \"individual\" to mean U.S. citizens and lawful\npermanent residents.\nSo not all individuals would be protected by\nthe Privacy Act. Now, Congress did that, not because\nhad it used the phrase \"personal privacy\" it would have\nbeen extending rights to corporations and foreign\ngovernments, but because personal privacy would have\nbeen too broad in that it would have -- even though it\nwould have been limited to individuals, it would have\nincluded a set of individuals that Congress wanted to\nexclude, that is, everybody who is not a U.S. citizen or\nlawful permanent resident.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a\nquestion? I'm not sure I understood your response to\nJustice Scalia. If there is ambiguity, if a term can be\ngiven two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know\nyou're challenging the clarity question here -- I\nthought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure\nwould necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as\nto the meaning of an exception, then we should change\nthe narrowest meaning.\nMR. YANG: Well, I think we disagree, and I\nthink this is why: No legislation pursues its primary\ngoal at all costs, and the FOIA exceptions that are at\nissue here protect very important values that Congress\ndeemed to warrant exceptions from the rule. And so if\nthe Court were to put a thumb on one scale of that\nbalance that Congress has tried to strike, after using\nall the normal tools of construction, we think that\nwould distort rather than advance the intent of\nCongress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nWe're not putting a thumb on the scale. Taking account\nof the fact that -- that Congress has many objectives in\nany legislation and that the limitations are as\nimportant as the -- the substantive end, nonetheless,\nwhen, having applied all of that, you end up with, gee,\nI don't know, it's ambiguous -- you say, even in that\nsituation, we don't apply the rule that -\nMR. YANG: Well, if you were to -- after\nusing all the normal tools that the Court does and\nyou're -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's what\nambiguity means. It does -- it means -\nMR. YANG: That's usually a very rare\ninstance, that you're exactly at equipoise. And -- and\nwe certainly aren't relying on narrow construction in\nthis case, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The Government wants\nto abandon the principle that we've set forth in our\ncases -\nMR. YANG: Well, we think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that exceptions to FOIA\nare to be narrowly construed. The Government does not\nsupport that.\nMR. YANG: We do not embrace that principle.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though we did? I\nmean -\nMR. YANG: Well, we think that those\ncases -- there are -- there are two lines of this\nCourt's decisions. Sometimes the Court explains that\nexceptions are narrowly construed, and sometimes the\nCourt explained that its decision has given -- its\ndecisions have given the exceptions practical reach in\norder to strike the appropriate balance that Congress\nhas tried to strike in FOIA.\nNow, let me just say, our narrow\nconstruction, to the extent the Court would want to\nreaffirm it here -- we're not advancing that -- would\nonly help the Government's position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your argument is based on\na case that will come before us. So -- but in this\ncase, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been\n-- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA\nexceptions are to be narrowly construed.\nMR. YANG: Well, the Government has broader\ninterests beyond a single case, and we think that,\nagain, we're not embracing strict construction in this\ncase. But, again, that would only help the Government's\nposition if you were to disagree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not going to help\nthe Government's position if the Government doesn't want\nto be helped.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm happy to leave you\nwhere you put yourself.\nMR. YANG: And we -- we accept that in this\ncase, and we think that the language of the text,\nparticularly when read in context in light of the\nstatutory history, and particularly when you take a look\nat what's gone on since 1974 -- I mean, in the more than\n35 years since, there has been uniform agreement that\nExemptions 6 and 7(C) apply only to individuals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I\nsuppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't\nthey?\nMR. YANG: Well, in certain contexts, family\nmembers, as this Court decided in Favish, can have a\nright to personal privacy. But the Court in Favish\nrecognized that that was a very, you know, significant\ndeparture from the prior understanding that the right of\npersonal privacy in FOIA protects information about the\nindividual, him- or herself, and recognized that there\nwas another strain of personal privacy, which from\nlongstanding tradition in terms of -- within our\nsociety, the Court could draw on in saying that personal\nprivacy should also protect, at least in the context\nof -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in some\ncontexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go\nbeyond the individual?\nMR. YANG: No, still it is individual. I\nmean, those are individual members of the family.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Aggregations of\nindividuals?\nMR. YANG: Well, no. I think an individual\nmember of the family has a personal privacy interest by\nvirtue of the relationship to the decedent in Favish.\nLet me go back. Just -- I think I would be\nremiss if I didn't remark upon this Court's decision -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. To go back to\nthe Chief's question, you do not deny that the\nindividuals who form the corporation, the officers and\nthe employees, are protected by the right of personal\nprivacy, and, indeed, you will -- you will edit any FOIA\nresponses to protect those individuals, even though\nthere are many of them, right?\nMR. YANG: Correct. If there were -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But as individuals, not as\n-- not as the corporation.\nMR. YANG: As individuals, because the\ninformation pertains to them.\nNow, going to the American Express case,\nwhich we explain in our reply, I think that is fatal to\nthe proposition that -- the proposition of AT&T that\nthere's a grammatical imperative that adjectives take\nthe meaning of a related noun.\nIn American Express, the Court construed the\nTruth in Lending Act, which includes the definition of\n\"person\" to include, for instance, corporations. It\nthen went on to construe a term, \"consumer,\" which\nconcerns transactions primarily for personal, family,\nhousehold, or, at the time, agricultural purposes. The\nCourt explained that a transaction -- the transaction\nthat was conducted for a corporation's business\npurposes, that it could not -- there was -- \"it did not\nfall within any of the purposes specified\" -- that was a\nquote -- in the definition of \"consumer.\" That is, it\ndid not concern personal purposes. We think that's\nfatal.\nThe Court, in fact, said it was the only\npossible conclusion and that there was no other possible\ninterpretation of the statutory phrase, after repeating\nthe enumeration of those four factors three times and\nthen on the very next page saying corporate -- a\ntransaction for corporate business purposes could not\nbe fit within that definition.\nFinally, I'd like to remark upon the\nanomalies that this Court would set us forth upon if it\nwere to decide that corporations have personal privacy.\nAt least in the context of individuals,\nthere's an established body of law and societal\nunderstanding of what a person, an individual, might\nhave a personal privacy interest in. But if we expand\npersonal to include corporations, foreign governments,\nState governments, local governments, defining what\nwould be personal privacy of those institutions would\nrequire an extraordinary exercise, a simple policy\njudgment on the part of the agencies first and then the\nCourt.\nAnd this Court in Favish was careful to\nexplain that that type of decision making would be\nimproper in that appropriate guides to -- to limit and\nmake objective a court and agency's decision making is\nrequired.\nCongress provided no benchmarks, never\naddressed corporate, foreign governments, or any other\nnon-human entity in the context of personal privacy.\nAnd, again, for 36 years, there's been\nuniform agreement that personal privacy applies in this\ncontext only to corporations.\nIf there are no further questions -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if an\nindividual has been -- individual human being has been\ninvestigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for\nrecords related to that investigation, would the name of\nthe individual not be turned over?\nMR. YANG: Well, if someone is asking for an\ninvestigation of Tony Yang -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nMR. YANG: -- our -- I don't -- I can't say\ndefinitively, but I think I can probably answer that\nthat even -- even answering the question of whether\nthere is a responsive record answers the question. So\nI -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the point.\nSo really your adversary is saying that the same harm\nthat occurs to an individual -- putting aside the\ndifficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the\nsame harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed\nto have been the target of an investigation is an\nidentical privacy right of a corporation, that a\ncorporation has the same negative effects as the\nindividual.\nMR. YANG: I think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I think they would\nconcede that privacy might need to be defined\ndifferently for corporations. They're simply saying\nthis privacy interest is not.\nMR. YANG: Well, the key point is that we\ndon't deny that corporations have some interest in\nconfidentiality that exists out there. For instance,\nAT&T has relied upon the common law of defamation where\na corporation's business interests, business reputation,\nis implicated. But even -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, parts of -- they\npled guilty already. So it is hard to imagine how much\nexponentially more damaging -\nMR. YANG: Well, to be fair to AT&T, there\nwas a settlement agreement in which they did not admit\nany wrongdoing. So -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that presupposes\nsome sort of investigation. So that's public knowledge\nalready.\nMR. YANG: That is public knowledge. But I\nthink the key point is that the corporate -- a\ncorporation's interests in maintaining its business\nreputation has been not regarded as a personal privacy\ninterest. It's true that they have interests, and FOIA\nprotects those interests, for instance, interests in\nconfidential commercial or financial information under\nExemption 4.\nAnd so what really the -- we come back to\nthe key point, which is when Congress used the phrase\n\"personal privacy,\" it would have had no reason in 1974,\nor even now, to think that term would have referred to\ncorporations. The fact that corporations have other\ninterests and other rights that might be legitimate is\nkind of beside the point because those interests are not\nreferred to in the law or otherwise as personal privacy\ninterests.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang.\nMR. YANG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Klineberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KLINEBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KLINEBERG: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether any\norganization, including not only business corporations\nlike AT&T but also nonprofit organizations and political\nassociations, should be categorically excluded from\nprotection under Exemption 7(C), such that this\nexemption will now offer less protection for privacy\ninterests than the Constitution and the common law.\nThis Court has consistently held that the\nprivacy protections under FOIA are broader. And the\ntext supports that position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you include in this\nthe people, the persons that you say are shielded by\nthis privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign\ngovernments, State and local governments? Those have\nall -- those all fall under the APA definition of\nperson.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, they do.\nAnd we would agree that, as a matter of statutory\nconstruction, the concept of personal privacy does apply\nto those -- those other categories of actors. Now,\nwhether once that privacy interest is balanced against\nthe public's interest in disclosure, that balance may\nwell be different with respect to public or foreign\nentities, but -- but certainly they -- they have a right\nto personal privacy under the terms of the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you give us an idea\nof -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4\nfor its confidential financial information, trade\nsecrets; and its employees have been protected under\nExemption 7.\nWhat is it, what would be -- would fall\nwithin this privacy exception that would not be\nconfidential business information or relate to employees\nof the corporation?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we -- I\ncould give you two categories or kinds of examples. One\nis, for example, a series of e-mails among corporate\nofficers -- granted, whose own personal names and\nidentifying information have been redacted, but in those\ne-mails, they may engage in a frank exchange about the\ncompetence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of\nthe corporation or a -- disparaging comments about\npotential -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why does that\nrelate to their privacy? I don't understand that. Why\ndoes that relate to the corporation's privacy interest?\nAnything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a\nprivacy interest?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, the -\nthe answer is simply that these were communications,\nconversations, that were occurring with an expectation\nof privacy by the individuals involved on behalf of\ntheir employer, and to the extent that they could be\nused to harm the reputation or the customer goodwill of\n-- of the company, they do, indeed, have a -- a personal\nprivacy interest in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that hurts the -\nthe -- the image or the goodwill of the company?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, everything that\nwith -- that is intended to be private is certainly\nsubject to the balancing that we're asking for under\nExemption 7(C); indeed, that Congress provided, that if\nit's -- it's an interest in personal privacy, then it is\nto be balanced to determine whether the disclosure of\nthat document is unwarranted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Klineberg, can you give\nme any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot\nabout the adjective \"personal.\" But we're not talking\njust about the adjective \"personal.\" What about the\nphrase \"personal privacy\"?\n\"Personal,\" yes, can indeed apply to\ncorporations sometimes, but there are certain phrases\nwhere it clearly does not. For example, you talk about\npersonal characteristics. That doesn't mean the\ncharacteristics of General Motors. You talk about\npersonal qualities. It doesn't mean the qualities of\nGeneral Motors. You talk about a point of personal\nprivilege. It's not a privilege of a corporation.\nAnd I think personal privacy is the same\nthing. Can you give me any examples in common usage\nwhere people would refer to the personal privacy of a -\nof a corporation? It's a very strange phrase to me.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, as\nJustice Alito asked my -- my colleague earlier, the -\nthe whole concept of -- of \"person\" as including a\ncorporation would surprise many people, the proverbial\nperson on the street.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I'm not talking about\nthat. I'll grant you that -- that \"personal\" could\nsometimes refer to a corporation, although the\nGovernment distinguishes it by etymology and so forth.\nNever mind that. I'm talking about personal privacy.\nDo you have any examples from the New York Times, from,\nyou know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to\nthe interests of a corporation as the \"personal privacy\"\nof General Motors?\nI cannot imagine somebody using the phrase\nlike that.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we're not aware\nof that phrase being used certainly in any statutory\ncontext -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you were about to\ngive a second example of where, even though it hasn't -\npersonal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one\nexample is the two officials who are saying unpleasant\nthings about a regulator. And what was your other\nexample?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, there's a -- there's a\nsub-example within that category which is the\ndisparaging of an important customer, some unpleasant\ncomments about an important customer of the corporation\nthat could then be used quite -- quite clearly by a -\nby a competitor to -- to harm the goodwill of the -- of\nthe corporation with respect to that customer.\nBut there is indeed another whole category\nof documents that goes beyond the -- the context of\nAT&T's interest here, and the example is internal\ndocuments within, say, an environmental nonprofit\norganization talking about their political strategies\nfor defeating an amendment to the Clean Air Act.\nAs an example, those political strategies\nthat were shared internally by -- by members of the\norganization without any intent to -- to have them\nbecome public would become subject to -- to automatic\ndisclosures, categorical disclosure, were the Government\nto prevail in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's -\nhow does that work? If you have -- the president of the\nenvironmental organization says something about whatever\nit is -- we can lobby this guy to get this change -- is\nhe able to protect that on the grounds of his personal\nprivacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the\n-- the organization as a whole?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthe answer is in most cases \"yes,\" that in -- that the\nidentity of the -- the specific speaker and any\nidentifying information corresponding to him or her\nwould be protected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is it such\na big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as\na whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to\nbe protected?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Indeed, Your Honor, I think\nthat is -- that is our position, that -- that the\npersonal privacy of the corporation is -- is affected by\nsuch disclosure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean\nyou're -- you're already protected, at least to a\nsignificant extent, because the individual officers\nwould be able to assert a privacy interest, to the\nextent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to\nthe corporation is also individually embarrassing to\nthem.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Right. But the -- but the\nredactions that would occur would in all likelihood\nsimply be redactions of their names and perhaps their\ntitles, but their -- the substance of their comments\nwould certainly be -- would be disclosed under the\nGovernment's view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are there any examples that\nyou have? That is, in the last 35 years, has there been\nany instance where the Justice Department or some other\nlaw enforcement agency compiled a file for law\nenforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for\nwhatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the\norganization's strategy, and it did not interfere to\nrelease it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but\nit might interfere with that organization's strategy,\nand so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or\nsomething, was very upset about it?\nDid you find a single example or a thousand\nexamples? Or how many examples did you find of that\nhappening?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Breyer, one of\nthe -- one of the things that has puzzled us in this\ncase is why -- why it has taken 35 years -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, one reason might be\nthat this has really never been a problem because all\nthe legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these\norganizations that have interests in privacy are\nactually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Another reason might be\nthat personal -- nobody ever thought that personal\nprivacy would cover this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This may be the first one.\nThat's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things\nyou would have looked for is an example of a real\nproblem of the kind you're talking about. I'm not\nsaying you don't have one. I would just like to know if\nyou found any, and what they are, so I could read them.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we haven't found\nanything specific to the -- in response to your\nquestion.\nBut I -- I will say that one of the\nexplanations for why this issue has become more\nimportant today than maybe it has been in recent past -\nthere really are three reasons. One is that Exemption\n4, which Mr. Yang discussed, has been increasingly\nnarrowed by the courts of appeals to the point where\nthey specifically say, and, indeed, the Government\nconcedes, that -- that the reputational concerns and the\nharm to customer goodwill is not the sort of harm that\nExemption 4 guards against.\nAnd so that has become increasingly clear\namong the courts of appeals, that the interests in\nconfidentiality that we're talking about under exception\n7(C) are not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, one possible reason\nyou don't find them is because it's very rare that a law\nenforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top\nstrategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy.\nThere might not be too many such records.\nIt -- another reason might be is that they\ndon't really care. Another reason might be -- I don't\nknow.\nBut if you haven't found any examples, what\nwe're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual\nexamples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg\nof the other instance, where the -- what was that first\none?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to know about the\nexample. What was the first one again?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, the -- the first one\nwas comments -- comments about a regulator or -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're worried about\nsaying something mean about a regulator. Okay. Yes,\nfine. Are there examples of that? Is this the first\none, and what's the empirical state?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, it's a -- I\ncannot point you to specific examples. They're -\nthey're sort of hard to -- hard to find in the -- in the\nsense that they are -- that they're not typically\nlitigated, and they certainly haven't been litigated\nunder -- under this -- under this exemption before.\nBut -- but I think the other explanation for\nwhy this matters today in a way that it might not have\nmattered so much before, two -- two other reasons: One\nis that -- that increasingly, FOIA is being used by -\nby competitors and legal adversaries to obtain\ninformation, not about what the government is doing, not\nabout what the government is up to, but about what\nevidence the government might have gathered from private\nparties.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that a reason to\nchange what was the understanding of Exemption 7? One\nof the items that doesn't work in your favor was the\nAttorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74\namendments.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, actually, Justice\nGinsburg, at the time of the '74 amendments the only\nexisting Attorney General memorandum was that of\nAttorney General Clark, which read \"personal privacy\" -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the --\nAttorney General Levi.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Right, and that -- that was\nissued subsequent to the amendments in 1974, and that\nwas an -- an interpretive gloss on the recent\namendments.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I meant.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Right. And so at the time\nthat Congress enacted the amendments, both under the\nPrivacy Act as well as Exemption 7(C), the -- the only\nexisting statement about what personal privacy might\nmean would be -- would have been Attorney General\nClark's understanding that personal privacy can in fact\nincorporate interests of corporations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if Attorney General\nLevi's description, which was -- which was issued for\nthe purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal\nGovernment what this new statute meant -- and it had a\nlot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about -\nabout this subject, you'd have thought somebody would\nhave objected.\nI mean, did some members of Congress who -\nwho had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about\nthe personal privacy of General Motors? I'm not aware\nof any objections along those lines.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, the --\nAttorney General Levi's memorandum did not go into a\nlong discussion or description of the -- of the\nanalysis. It simply said it does not appear or does not\nseem to apply to -- to corporations. And it's\nabsolutely true. There -- this is not -- this issue\nhasn't -- hasn't really been litigated and presented.\nBut our position is that there is nothing in\nthe plain language that would indicate that Congress\nintended to categorically exclude corporations. It is\ncertainly true that the legislative history at the time,\nas the Government spends quite a bit of time exploring,\ndoes suggest that what was -- what was in most people's\nminds was protection of individual privacy. But there\nis no indication that they intended to exclude -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the burden of the\nGovernment to show that they intended to exclude\ncorporations, or is it your burden to show that this\nexception was meant to include corporations? I would\nthink the latter is where the burden lies in this case.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, our -\nour burden is to -- is to defend our view of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if you're asking\nthe Government to show that the -- there was an intent\nto exclude corporations, I don't think that's their\nburden. I think it's your burden to show that this\nexemption was intended to include corporations.\nMR. KLINEBERG: I agree, Your Honor, that we\nare -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words\n\"personal privacy\" in the statute apply to corporations.\nI think one of the background facts is that there is no\nindication that anyone thought that it was not to be\nincluded. But let me -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your\ncentral argument is that because \"person\" is defined to\ninclude corporation, \"personal\" in the same statute must\ninclude corporate.\nI tried to sit down and come up with other\nexamples where the adjective was very different from the\nroot noun. And it turns out it's not hard at all. You\nhave \"craft\" and \"crafty.\" Totally different. \"Crafty\"\ndoesn't have much to do with \"craft.\" \"Squirrel,\"\n\"squirrelly.\" Right?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, \"pastor\" -\nyou have a \"pastor\" and \"pastoral.\" Same root, totally\ndifferent.\nSo I don't understand -- I don't think\nthere's much to the argument that because \"person\" means\none thing, \"personal\" has to be the same relation.\nMR. KLINEBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, let me\ntry to explain precisely what our proposed rule of\nconstruction is, because I think there's been some\nconfusion, and I -- and I think the Government has -\nhas not properly characterized it, and certainly in\ntheir reply brief.\nWe do not agree -- or we do not sign on to\nthe term \"grammatical imperative,\" because our concern\nwith that phrase is that it might suggest that the rule\nis to be applied regardless of the consequences, and\nthat is not our position.\nOur position is that where the adjective\nmeans \"of or relating to\" a term that Congress has\nexpressly defined, that definition should be applied, so\nlong as it makes sense to do so in light of the text and\nstructure of the statute as a whole.\nSo, in this case, Your Honor, \"personal\"\ndoes -- is defined -- when you open up the dictionary,\nthe very first definition is \"of or relating to a\nparticular person.\" \"Person\" is, then, defined by\nCongress as -- to include not only individuals, but -\nbut corporations and other associations.\nSo in this particular context, it makes\nperfect sense to look to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Klineberg, you have\nread the brief of the Project on Government Oversight,\nwhere they give dozens and dozens of examples to show\nthat, overwhelmingly, \"personal\" is used to describe an\nindividual, not an artificial being. And it is the\noverwhelming use of \"personal.\"\nMR. KLINEBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we do not\ndispute that personal is often, even many, many times,\nused to describe an individual and can only be\nunderstood in that context. Indeed, the Truth in\nLending Act argument that the Government made in its\nreply brief is a perfect example. The word \"personal\"\nthere is -- is mentioned alongside \"personal,\" \"family,\"\nand \"household.\"\nAnd, indeed, even in that very same\nstatutory definition of \"consumer,\" the word is referred\nto as \"a natural person.\" So, in that context, it would\nbe absurd or inappropriate to -- to borrow the concept\nof the definition of \"person.\"\nAll we're saying is when it is not absurd,\nwhen it is not -- does not do violence to the statute,\nunder those circumstances, it makes perfect sense to\nborrow the definition that Congress provided.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be similar to\nmedical files and such, under Exemption 6, that uses the\nsame phrase, \"unwanted invasion on personal privacy\"?\nSo what would your reading do to Exemption 6, and how\nwould we create or even make sense of Exemption 6?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Your Honor, we don't believe\nour reading does any -- any damage to this Court's\njurisprudence in Exemption 6, and the -- and the simple\nreason is that while the words \"personal privacy\" in\nExemption 6 do mean -- and we agree with the Attorney\nGeneral Clark in this -- do mean that -- that -- the\nsame thing as it means in Exemption 7(C), but because -\nprecisely for the reason you said, Justice Sotomayor -\nthe personnel and medical and similar files limits the\nlikely scope of that privacy interest to individual,\nnatural -- natural persons. And that's simply not\nbecause of the words \"personal privacy,\" but because of\nthe company that those words keep in that -- in that\nparticular exemption.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? I mean, if you're\nsaying that personal privacy has some overlap with\nindividual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're\ngoing to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we\nhave to give meaning to \"and similar files\"? And so\nwhat would those be?\nMR. KLINEBERG: Well, Your Honor, as this\nCourt said in the Washington Post case, the\nunderstanding of \"similar files\" is defined by the two\nbenchmarks that are expressly provided, right?\nPersonnel and medical. So the kinds of files are\nlimited to the sorts of files in which individual\ninformation is likely to be contained. In that case, it\nwas a passport file.\nAgain, our -- our argument is simply that\nit's that part of Exemption 6 that does the limiting\nwork in terms of its scope. The words \"personal\nprivacy\" mean the same thing in Exemption 6 as -- as\nthey do in Exemption 7(C).\nThe -- the other point that I -- I certainly\nwant to make clear is that our position is that personal\nprivacy is only the first step in the determination\nwhether or not a particular document is disclosed,\nbecause if the Government prevails, there will be no\nneed even to articulate a public interest in the\ndisclosure of potentially harmful documents. Instead,\nthey will be automatically available to any competitor\nor legal adversary.\nAnd all we are asking for and, indeed, all\nthat Congress provided for is that the privacy interest\nbe weighed against the public interest in disclosure.\nAnd what the -- what the FCC did here was to\ncategorically exclude corporations from the protections\nof Exemption 7(C). And -- and all we are saying is that\nthose interests are legitimate and just need to be\nbalanced. And what the government's obligations under\nthese circumstances are is that they need to weigh the\nprivate interests in -- in the documents against the\narticulated public interest in disclosure. And that\ninterest, of course, has to do with what the government\nis up to. What do these documents tell us about what\nthe government is doing?\nAnd if, as the amici on the Government's\nside suggests, there are lots of public -- lots of\npublic value and public interest in the disclosure, then\nthat balance is more likely to be weighed in favor of\ndisclosure. And all we are asking for, though, is that\nthat balance take place. And what's happened here is\nthat -- is, as I said; it's a categorical exclusion that\nsimply is inconsistent with the terms that Congress laid\nout in exemption 7(C).\nCongress did not intend for FOIA to be a\ntool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access\nto harmful or embarrassing documents compiled for law\nenforcement purposes where such documents do nothing to\nopen agency action to public scrutiny. If the\nGovernment has its way in this case, the result will be\nwhat this Court decried in Favish, which was that it\nwould be the failure to protect the privacy of citizens\nagainst the uncontrolled release of information compiled\nthrough the power of the state.\nIf there are no further questions, I urge\nthat the -- that the Third Circuit be affirmed. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Yang, you have 6 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. YANG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAT&T appears to have changed or at least\nmodified its position somewhat from the position\narticulated at page 14 of its brief. There AT&T\nsays, \"By expressly defining the noun 'person' to\ninclude corporations, Congress necessarily defined the\nadjective form of that noun -- 'personal' -- also to\ninclude corporations.\"\nNow, AT&T has given up on the grammatical\nimperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals'\ndecision in this case. There's nothing left. AT&T can\nprovide no example where the term \"personal privacy\" has\never been used to refer to a corporation, much less a\nforeign government or State or local government in any\ncontext, whether it be FOIA, the law generally, or even\nin common usage.\nAT&T can provide no example of any problems\nthat have arisen in over 35 years of the government's\nconsistent administration of this provision. In fact,\nall indications point in simply one direction. Personal\nprivacy applies only to individuals. The terms\n\"personal\" and the terms \"privacy\" do that alone. And,\ntogether, \"personal privacy makes\" that clear.\nThe legislative history, the decisions of\nthis Court pointing to the balance applying only to\nindividuals, individual rights. All point in the same\ndirection.\nWe would ask that the Third Circuit be\nreversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
