        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-694, Judulang v. Holder.\nMr. Fleming.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Hernandez-Casillas, the Attorney General\nconfirmed that a lawful permanent resident subject to\ndeportation, quote, \"must have the same opportunity to\nseek discretionary relief as an alien who has\ntemporarily left this country and upon reentry been\nsubject to exclusion.\"\nTwo months later in its published decision\nin Matter of Meza, the BIA again confirmed that an\nimmigrant deportable for an aggravated felony could seek\nrelief because his conviction could also form the basis\nfor excludability. Immigrants in situations\nindistinguishable from Mr. Judulang's applied for and\nreceived relief under this rule.\nThe BIA's decision in Blake changed the law.\nWithout explaining or even initially acknowledging that\nit was doing so, the Blake rule was impermissibly\nretroactive, and it is arbitrary and capricious on its\nown merits. We would submit the evidence -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you explain -- I\nmean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake\nand Brieva changed the law. How do you explain the\nlanguage in Matter of Wadud, which antedates by a good\ndeal those two cases, 1984, which says: \"Section 212(c)\ncan only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the\nground of deportation charged is also a ground of\ninadmissibility.\" It seems to me that that's -- that's\nthe basic point.\nMR. FLEMING: Two responses to that,\nJustice Scalia: I agree, Matter of Wadud is the\nprincipal response that the Government has, and it does\nnot help them at all. Wadud was deportable for a\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. 1546, and the BIA had held,\nin a case called Matter of R-G- in 1958, that that\nconviction did not render him excludable.\nAnd that's confirmed later in the case of\nMatter of Jimenez-Santillano, which also involved a 1546\nconviction, where the BIA says that if Mr. Jimenez had\nleft the country and returned, it appears that he would\nnot have been inadmissible, and compares that situation\nto someone convicted of a firearms offense, which the\nboard and the Attorney General had always said were not\nwaivable.\nTo the extent there's any ambiguity in the\nlanguage that Your Honor read, it could not have\nsurvived the Attorney General's decision in\nHernandez-Casillas, which I just quoted at the beginning\nof the presentation, which said that what one looks to\nis whether the alien in exclusion proceedings would be\nable to invoke section 212(c) relief. And when the\nboard then addressed the case of the aggravated felony\nin Matter of Meza, it did not even address Wadud or view\nit as binding at all. It looked to the conviction and\nwhether it formed a basis for excludability.\nAnd the BIA then followed up with no fewer\nthan eight decisions in crime of violence cases,\nindistinguishable from this case, where the -- the BIA\ncited, not Wadud, not any of the other cases that the\nGovernment is relying on, but cited Meza as articulating\nthe doctrine that the focus of analysis is on the\nconviction. And the Court has the briefs of several\nformer immigration officials, including two INS general\ncounsel and several INS trial attorneys, confirming that\nthat was the position and the basis on which the\ngovernment litigated these cases -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -\nMR. FLEMING: -- and in fact -- yes, Justice\nKagan.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Please finish.\nMR. FLEMING: If I may, I was just going to\nsay that a number of these cases, crime of violence\ncases, reached the merits in both the BIA and the courts\nof appeals without the government even suggesting that\nthere was a statutory counterpart problem. In fact,\nwhen it has suited its purposes the government and the\nBIA have admitted that Blake was a change, including in\na brief filed in the Ninth Circuit less than a year ago.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You cite some cases. You\nsay there was a dramatic change in the law. The\nGovernment cites some cases, and it says there was no\nchange in the law. What if the truth lies someplace in\nthe middle? What if, in fact, when you look before\nBlake, what you see is some amount of confusion? That\nthe board sometimes was following the Blake rule, but\nthat at other times individual judges or maybe the board\nitself were doing something different, because the\nindividual circumstances suggested that they should, or\njust because they weren't so clear on the difference\nbetween these two approaches.\nAnd then Blake comes along, and what Blake\ndoes is neither to change something dramatically nor to\njust reaffirm what was there, but in some sense to\ncreate a little bit of order out of chaos. What would\nthat do to your argument if that's the way one\nunderstood Blake?\nMR. FLEMING: Obviously, Justice Kagan, we\ndon't think that is the proper way to understand Blake.\nBut to answer the question, for purposes of the\nretroactivity analysis, the Court uses what the Court in\nSt. Cyr called \"considerations of fair notice,\nreasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\" And we\nwould submit that reliance was more than reasonable and\nexpectations more than settled as to how the board was\naddressing crime of violence aggravated felony\nconvictions prior to Blake, as is shown by the evidence\nthat I cited a minute ago, namely the position that the\ngovernment itself was taking in these cases and the way\nthat immigrants would have been advised by both criminal\ndefense counsel and immigration counsel, including, for\nthat matter, INS trial counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, reliance on confused\nlaw is certainly not reasonable reliance. I mean, if\nyou accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan\noperates from, how can you say that -- that you're\nreasonably relying on confused law?\nMR. FLEMING: I don't accept the premise at\nall, Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a -\nMR. FLEMING: -- that the law was confused.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different point.\nMR. FLEMING: But even if -- even if there\nwas some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think\nthere was, I think the record in this -- before the\nCourt is very clear, that people were advised by\ncompetent counsel and that the government itself took\nthe same position in front of the immigration courts and\nthe courts of appeals that someone with a crime of\nviolence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief\nbecause that conviction would make him or her\nexcludable. And the availability of relief in\ndeportation proceedings is meant to be the same as it\nwould be in exclusion proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand the\nadvice of counsel, but what is the reasonable\nexpectation of that's been altered?\nMR. FLEMING: The reasonable expectation\nthat once someone pleads guilty, Mr. Chief Justice, to\nan excludable offense, one that would be waivable in\nexclusion proceedings, that a waiver may be sought in\nsubsequent deportation proceedings on exactly the same\nbasis. And that is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're saying -\nMR. FLEMING: -- a published policy of the\nBIA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the\nexpectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent\nfelony, that he expects, well, if I'm deported because\nof that I am going to be able to seek discretionary\nwaiver?\nMR. FLEMING: Yes, that's quite correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. That's the ruling in St. Cyr, that\nwhen someone is -- when someone pleads guilty to an\noffense that is eligible for relief under section\n212(c), there is reliance on the possibility -- not a\nguarantee of a waiver, obviously -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -\nMR. FLEMING: -- but the avoidance of\nmandatory deportation -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Okay.\nMR. FLEMING: -- by appealing to the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How often are these\nwaivers granted?\nMR. FLEMING: Quite frequently, I think.\nThe Court had pointed out in St. Cyr that they are\nfrequent. And now, because the category of people who\nare eligible involves people who have very old\nconvictions, they necessarily pled before 1996, they are\nusually minor convictions, they involve people who have\nbeen in this country for a long time. They frequently\nhave property. They have families. They're -- they can\nshow rehabilitation. Often they only come to the\nattention of the immigration authorities by applying for\nnaturalization or by renewing their green cards, and\nthey get thrown into deportation on the basis of these\nold convictions that, at the time of the plea, would\nhave been eligible for a waiver. And it is simply\nunfair to change the law, as Blake did, and impose that\nchange on people who relied on it in pleading guilty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in terms of the\nexpectation interest, we have to visualize someone who\nis facing a serious charge and is entering a plea\nbargain, where presumably the consideration of what he's\npleading to, how much of a sentence he's going to get,\nall that, are dominant considerations. And he's also\ngoing to say: Well, I've been advised that I will be\nable to apply for a discretionary waiver. So, I'm going\nto plead guilty.\nThat's a fairly unlikely scenario, isn't it?\nMR. FLEMING: On the contrary,\nMr. Chief Justice. The Court in St. Cyr made very clear\nthat's a very likely situation. It cited a couple of\ncases at that time that specifically involved that\ncolloquy. The NIJC amicus brief, which is before the\nCourt in this case, identifies a couple of situations,\nincluding the case of Mr. Ronald Bennett, who was\nadvised by his lawyer that when he pled guilty, it would\nnot be a problem for him for his immigration status\nbecause he could seek 212(c) protection.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I'm not\nquestioning the fact that he was advised, but presumably\nthe lawyer will also advise him: Oh, and you also have\nto pay the $250, you know, restitution, whatever, fee.\nI am just questioning how significant that\nadvice will be when someone's determining whether to\nplead guilty or not to a violent felony.\nMR. FLEMING: I -- I understand,\nMr. Chief Justice. It is quite significant for people\nwhose ability to stay in this country is highly\nimportant to them. They have family here. They've\nlived here for decades. But the risk that they're going\nto be -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the violent felony -\nthe violent felony in this case, he had a suspended\nsentence, didn't he?\nMR. FLEMING: He was sentenced to -- to time\nserved essentially for this conviction. That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, if he had been\nconvicted of a lesser offense that was not a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude, he would not be eligible for\nthe waiver; isn't that right?\nMR. FLEMING: That -- if -- if the offense\nwould not have been waivable in the exclusion\nproceedings, he would not be eligible. That's correct,\nJustice Alito -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that -\nMR. FLEMING: -- but there might be other\nforms of relief that he -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't that strange?\nSuppose you have somebody who's charged with a lesser\noffense that -- that doesn't involve moral turpitude and\na greater offense that does, and the defense attorney\ncomes to the client and says: I've got great news; the\nprosecutor will take a plea to the lesser offense and\ndrop the greater one.\nI guess that would be -- that would be bad,\npotentially bad advice, because he ought to plead to the\nmore serious offense because then he would be eligible\nfor a waiver.\nMR. FLEMING: He would be eligible for a\nwaiver under section 212(c), Justice Alito -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMR. FLEMING: But that is not the only form\nof relief that someone who pleads guilty to a crime\ncould potentially seek. And people who plead to\nnon-inadmissible offenses, offenses that do not lead to\ntheir exclusion, had other avenues at the time that they\ncould have pursued. For instance, they could have\npursued adjustment of status. That's the -- the BIA's\ndecision in Matter of Gabryelsky. In order to -- to\nadjust status, all that matters is that you not be\ninadmissible to the country. And even if you are\ninadmissible, you can seek a 212(c) waiver during that\nprocess. Whether you are deportable or not doesn't\nmatter.\nSo, there are many other ways. Looking at\nsection 212(c) on its own, it might appear anomalous.\nBut looking at the immigration law as it was before\n1996, there are other options.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- what you say\neven further reduces the significance of the 212(c)\npossibility of waiver to the person pleading guilty.\nYou're saying -- you're saying, yes, even though -- even\nthough you couldn't get it under 212(c), there are a lot\nof other ways you might have gotten it.\nMR. FLEMING: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.\nMaybe I wasn't clear. The people who could get the\nother relief are people who pled guilty to crimes that\ndo not involve moral turpitude, which was Justice\nAlito's hypothetical. But people who plead to crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude potentially don't have that -\nthat avenue open to them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -\nMR. FLEMING: For them, section 212(c) is\nvery important, and they could rely on its availability,\nand did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but there's a large\ncategory of people who -- who plead guilty to crimes\nthat do not involve moral turpitude and yet are not\notherwise excludable under 212(c), right?\nMR. FLEMING: I don't know which category\nYour Honor is thinking of. But, certainly, you can\nplead guilty to a crime that does not involve moral\nturpitude; then you would not be eligible for section\n212(c) relief; but there might be some other way that\nyou can -- that you can get at it.\nBut that is not this category of people.\nThe category of people at issue here are people who pled\nbefore 1996 to aggravated felony crimes of violence,\nalmost all of which, if not all of which, are going to\nbe crimes involving moral turpitude that are excludable\nand therefore eligible for a waiver. It doesn't\nnecessarily mean they'll get it; but it at least means\nthey have the right to ask the Attorney General to\nexercise his discretion.\nAnd I would submit that, as this Court\nindicated in St. Cyr, the private interest in avoiding\nmandatory deportation is very strong. We have what I\nbelieve is a sudden and abrupt change in the law in\nBlake. And it could not have been foreseen; in fact, it\nwasn't foreseen by advocates on both sides of the \"v\" in\nthese cases.\nThe remaining question for purposes of the\nretroactivity analysis is only the strength of the\nagency's interest in applying the rule retroactively.\nI'd submit that that interest here is no stronger than\nit is in the ordinary mine run of cases, and in fact it\nis weaker, because all that we are talking about is the\nopportunity to submit an application for adjudication on\nthe merits, which is subject to the discretion of the\nagency. Mr. Judulang would have the burden of\nconvincing an immigration judge and the Board of\nImmigration Appeals that he deserves relief in the\nexercise of discretion. And so, under Chenery -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say a sharp\nchange, I think that this is a very confusing set of\ndecisions. And the Wadud case that was brought up\nbefore has a footnote that says that -- that the board\nhad stated a waiver of inadmissibility may be granted in\ndeportation if the alien was excludable as a result of\nthe same facts. And then that footnote ends: \"We shall\nwithdraw from that language in each of these cases.\"\nMR. FLEMING: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg, and the operative language there is \"as a\nresult of the same facts.\"\nWhat Wadud was arguing was that recognizing\nthat his conviction would not make him excludable\nbecause it was not a crime involving moral turpitude, he\nsaid: Nonetheless, you should look to the facts of my\nconduct, because what I did was so turpitudinous that\nthe government would surely have charged me as\nexcludable.\nAnd the board said: We are not going to do\nthat, and to the extent our prior decisions suggested\nthat, we're withdrawing from that language.\nIt did not say, however, that the board\nwould not look to convictions to determine\nexcludability. And, in fact, in Meza, which is after\nWadud, it did just that. And when the Court came to\ncrime of violence cases subsequently to that, the\nprecedent that it relied on was Meza, which focuses on\nthe conviction. I agree it does not focus on the facts,\nbut I don't think the language that Your Honor read\nundermines our position at all.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That is so bizarre it makes\nme -- that he's pleading to prove that what he did was\nreally turpitudinous. It makes me think that maybe the\nen banc Ninth Circuit was right, that this whole line of\ncases has gone off along the wrong track quite a while\nago.\nMR. FLEMING: So -- I mean, the notion that\nthis form of relief is available in deportation\nproceedings is long settled.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, yes.\nMR. FLEMING: It's the premise of this\nCourt's decision in St. Cyr. The agency has never\nundermined it or suggested that it was going to retreat\nfrom it. No party before this Court is suggesting that\nSt. Cyr should have been overruled on that basis. So, I\n-- and I think it's very clear that Congress, after the\nrelief had been extended to deportation proceedings,\nenacted provisions in 1990 and 1996 that would have no\noperative effect if relief was not available in\ndeportation proceedings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a lot -- a lot of\nthe statutory changes in the policies of the INS date\nback -- was it the Second Circuit's case in Francis,\nwhich talked about the equal protection component of the\ntwo classes comprised of those in exclusion proceedings\nand those in what were then called deportation\nproceedings?\nDo we just accept that? It -- it seems to\nme that that whole equal protection rationale is quite\ndoubtful.\nMR. FLEMING: Well, there -- there are two\nresponses to that, Justice Kennedy. The first is the\nagency has accepted that in Matter of Silva as a correct\ninterpretation of the statute, and that has been on the\nbooks for 35 years now, approximately, and Congress has\nnever suggested any disapproval of it. Rather, on the\ncontrary, it has assumed that that is the law. And\nthat's after the Solicitor General refused to seek\ncertiorari of that decision. The comparison also was\nnot between people in exclusion and people in\ndeportation. It was between two -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if we thought that\nthey had gone down the wrong path originally, there's\nnothing we can do about it, and we just say we're in\nthis wilderness and we can't get out?\nMR. FLEMING: I think, Justice Kennedy,\nCongress at this point has not only acquiesced but\nindicated its understanding of the -- of the way that\nthe agency has applied the law. And, honestly, I think\nthis is a -- a question for the Government, because the\nagency has never suggested that there was any basis for\nretreating from that position at this late date.\nUnless the Court has further questions on\nretroactivity, I would move quickly to our substantive\nposition, which is that even without regard to\nretroactivity, the Blake rule is arbitrary and\ncapricious. And there are two basic reasons for that:\nFirst, that it rests on improper factors; and, second,\nthat it leads to results that the BIA itself has\ndisavowed.\nFirst of all, Congress has never suggested\nthat the words that it chooses in deportation provisions\nare somehow a key to eligibility for section 212(c)\nrelief. And, yet, that is largely everything that the\nboard relied on in Blake, was a comparison of the choice\nof words in deportation provisions to the choice of\nwords in exclusion provisions. But the -- the\nprovisions of the deportation statute are not some\nenigmatic code from which the BIA can discern section\n212(c) eligibility. They determine who's deportable,\nbut they have nothing to say about who is eligible for\nsection 212(c).\nSection 212(c) eligibility turns on whether\nyou are inadmissible. That's what 212(c) by its terms\nrefers to. And that's driven home, I believe, by the\naddition of the \"crime of violence\" language in 1990 as\na basis for deportation.\nAggravated felonies were added in 1990 at a\ntime when it's, I believe, clear that most of them, if\nnot all of them, were already bases for exclusion. So,\nthere was no need for Congress to say crimes of violence\nare excludable. They already were because they were\ncrimes involving moral turpitude. It would have been\nredundant to put the same words in the exclusion\nstatute. Congress didn't do it. Congress simply wanted\nto make clear that these people were now going to be\ndeportable based on the length of their sentence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ncomparability of the crime involved in St. Cyr? That\nwas a drug offense. Does the inadmissibility\ncriterion -- does that accord with the one for\ndeportation?\nMR. FLEMING: Yes, it does, Justice\nGinsburg, and -- because Mr. St. Cyr would have been\nboth deportable and excludable for his offense. That's\nthe logic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that -- there the\nlinguistic comparison works, right?\nMR. FLEMING: Well, the board in Blake\nconcluded that that was -- that the linguistic\ncomparison worked there so that it did not have to find\nitself at odds with this Court's decision in St. Cyr.\nThat's true. But when the Court -- when the\nboard originally made that decision in Matter of Meza,\nthey didn't just look to the linguistic comparison.\nI agree that if there's a perfect linguistic\nmatch, then you might not need to go to look at the\nconviction, because someone who falls under one will\nnecessarily fall under the other. But just because\nCongress uses different words in the deportation\nsubsection that's asserted against a particular alien\ndoesn't mean that the analysis stops there, because the\nconviction might well make the person excludable such\nthat the application that they're able to file in\ndeportation proceedings should give them the same relief\nas they would have in exclusion proceedings.\nSo, what happened in 1990 when \"crime of\nviolence\" was added, according to the Government, is\nthat that was a radical change in section 212(c)\neligibility stealthily and silently, because of course\nwhile Congress was amending 212(c) at that time, saying\nit was no longer available to deportable aliens who\ndidn't show up for certain hearings and no longer\navailable for aggravated felons who were deportable who\nhad served more than 5 years in prison, it had said\nnothing suggesting that people who had committed\naggravated felony crimes of violence were all of a\nsudden ineligible for section 212(c) relief, even though\nit could have said that. The notion that one can infer\nor decode those provisions as shutting out section\n212(c) relief for this group of people silently, even\nthough the overlap is perfect if not near perfect, is,\nwe would submit, simply unreasonable. The arbitrariness\ncomes through in another way which is that -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fleming, the Government\nsays that it has an interest in treating people in\ndeportation proceedings less favorably, if you will,\nthan people in exclusion proceedings. Do you dispute\nthat broad premise that the government could develop a\nsystem which treated those two groups differently?\nMR. FLEMING: That is not the way that the\nagency has ever treated permanent resident aliens. In\nfact, if that is the Government's position, that is\nclearly a change in the law. The BIA said going back to\nSilva, but in Matter of A-A-, a 1992 published decision,\nthat it is the long -- the, quote, \"long established\nview of the Attorney General and the Federal courts that\nan application for section 212(c) relief filed in the\ncontext of deportation proceedings is equivalent to one\nmade at the time an alien physically seeks admission\ninto the United States.\" That's footnote 22 of Matter\nof A-A-.\nSo, the agency's longstanding position, at\nleast since Silva, has been that there is no difference\nbetween an application filed in deportation and one\nfiled in exclusion. And that I think is consistent with\nwhat Attorney General Thornburgh said in the Matter of\nHernandez-Casillas.\nI'd submit one last point, which is the\narbitrariness of what the BIA is doing shines through in\nthat it has led to consequences that the BIA has itself\nrepudiated as inconsistent with the statute. And the\nmost salient example is the one that the Government\nadmits on page 26 of its brief, which is that the -\nthere's a possibility that someone could get a waiver of\ninadmissibility one day for a given conviction and then\nbe deported the next day for the very same conviction.\nNow, the BIA in 1956 in Matter of G-A- said\nthat was clearly repugnant. Now, the agency cannot have\nit both ways. The statute cannot mean X and not X. If\nit does, that is the hallmark of arbitrariness. The\nGovernment's only answer, as far as I know, is that it\nwill exercise its prosecutorial discretion to avoid that\nsituation. I would submit that an agency cannot defend\nan arbitrary policy by saying that it is going to be\nenforced in a capricious way and that it will all\nbalance out in the end.\nThis Court should evaluate the Blake rule on\nits own merits, and if it is arbitrary, as it clearly\nis, it should be disapproved. The other indication of\narbitrariness is that the Blake -- the Blake rule\nrevives the distinction between deportable aliens,\nJustice Kennedy, who traveled abroad and returned and\nother deportable aliens who did not travel aboard and\nreturn.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The Government says that's\nnot the case. The Government says that it does not\ntreat those two groups differently.\nMR. FLEMING: The Government's only -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have evidence to the\ncontrary?\nMR. FLEMING: Yes. Yes, Justice Kagan. The\nevidence is the Attorney General's position -- opinion\nin Hernandez-Casillas. The Government's only citation\nfor that is a footnote in Wadud arguing that supposedly\nthe nunc pro tunc doctrine is not still good law. But 5\nyears after Wadud, in Hernandez-Casillas, Attorney\nGeneral Thornburgh was asked by the INS to disapprove\nMatter of L- -- Justice Jackson's decision as Attorney\nGeneral, and Matter of G-A- and the nunc pro tunc\ndoctrine that is set out in those decisions, and he\nexpressly declined to do so. On the contrary, he\nreaffirmed that in cases where the alien has left and\ncome back, the Attorney General and the board have\npermitted the alien to raise any claim for discretionary\nrelief that the alien could otherwise have raised had he\nbeen excluded. So, nunc pro tunc clearly is still good\nlaw, and the Government seemed to agree with that as\nrecently as its brief in opposition to certiorari.\nAs for the travel distinction itself the\nGovernment, to its credit, does not try to defend it,\nand with good reason. The agency in Silva has long held\nthat there is no distinction or no rational way to\ndistinguish under the statute between people who are in\ndeportation proceedings who have left and come back and\npeople in deportations who have not.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'd\nreserve of the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner does not dispute that some\ncomparability analysis must be applied to prevent relief\nunder former section 212(c) from being extended to\ncertain grounds of deportability. But his methodology\nof asking whether his offense could have made him\nexcludable is inconsistent with established cases from\nthe board that long predated the ones at issue here\ninvolving firearms offenses and visa fraud.\nJustice Scalia brought up the case in Wadud.\nThat was a visa fraud case. It was a prosecution under\n18 U.S.C. 1546. That's a provision that penalizes\nfraudulent and other misuse of visas and other\nimmigration documents. It's a very broad criminal\nprovision. It's long been a ground of deportability.\nAnd at the time, the alien argued that this is fraud.\nIt's a crime involving moral turpitude, and, therefore,\nI would be subject to exclusion. In Wadud, the board\nrejected that analysis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but -- but it\nmay save a little time at least if -- we're in an arcane\narea of the law, to me. It was created by Robert\nJackson, Attorney General, and by Thornburgh, Attorney\nGeneral. And if we're starting with that, what that\nsays is we have a list over here of excludable things,\nand we have a list of deportable things. And if you're\ndeported for a reason that shows up on that first list,\nthan the AG could waive it. That's basically the\noutline I have. And also I have, which isn't quite\nright, that in that first list there's something called\n-- big letters -- CIMT or something, crime of moral\nturpitude. And all the things on this second list, the\nbig issue is, is it a crime of moral turpitude?\nAnd, as I looked through the opinions, this\nis what I got out of them. And This is tentative. I\ngot out, just as you say, there are two things in the\nsecond list which are not crimes of moral turpitude.\nThey consist of illegal entry crimes and gun crimes.\nAnd there are special reasons for the first, and the\nsecond is debatable; but they've been consistent with\nthat.\nThen there are things that are on both\nlists, they are a crime of moral turpitude. I counted\nat least eight cases saying, for example, rape,\nburglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery, indecency\nwith a child, and probably some others are all crimes of\nmoral turpitude. So, it clicks in, okay?\nThen I find Blake, and Blake says sexual\nabuse of a minor is not a crime of moral turpitude.\nThat's a little surprising. But it gives us a reason:\nBecause -- and this was the problem here. It talks\nabout there has to be substantial -- there has to be\nsimilar language in the two lists. I don't know where\nthat one came from. It had certainly not been in the\nearlier cases.\nAnd now we have this case, which is\nvoluntary manslaughter. I would have thought that\nvoluntary manslaughter is right at the heart of the\nlists that they said the things are crimes of moral\nturpitude, and not like visa crimes or gun crimes, if I\nhad read the cases.\nSo, where do I end up? Well, what I end up\nwith this, and this is what I would like you to reply\nto. Justice Brandies once said something like we have\nto know before we can say whether an agency opinion is\nright or wrong, what they're talking about. I felt\nperplexity after I had read through these decisions. In\nother words, I don't understand it.\nSo, I would like you to explain to me why\nthis all fits together and how, if you can do that. I\ncouldn't get that clear explanation from the brief, and\nI suspect it is not your fault.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I agree that the history\nand the law here is relatively complicated, and it has\nhad a lot of moving pieces over the years. But I think\nthat the board has been very consistent, especially\nbeginning in the 1984 Wadud decision that was picked up\nin the Jimenez-Santillano decision and also in firearms\noffenses. Justice Breyer, you talked about the fact\nthat the board had been consistent in firearms offenses.\nAnd Petitioner does not dispute that firearms offenses\nare ones that do not have a comparable ground -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. The one that was\nworrying me: rape, burglary, manslaughter,\nsecond-degree robbery, indecency with a -\nMR. GANNON: If I could go back to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All those cases -- there\nare about seven or eight of them.\nMR. GANNON: If I could go back to -- just\nfor a second, to firearms offenses. The board there has\ncontinued to say that there is no comparable ground for\nfirearms offenses, even if your firearms offense would\nbe something that could have been considered a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude.\nIf you look at the board's 1992 decision in\nMontenegro, that was a case that was assault with a\nfirearm. And so, it wasn't merely possession of a\nhandgun or an automatic weapon or a sawed-off shotgun -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is there any\naggravated felony crime of violence that is not a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nboard pointed out in the Brieva-Perez decision that\nminor but relatively common crimes of violence,\nincluding simple assaults and burglary, generally are\nnot considered to be crimes involving moral turpitude.\nIn the reply brief, Petitioner points to a\nboard opinion in Louissaint saying that the -- that the\nrecord is muddled on burglary, but that opinion only\nshowed that residential burglary isn't a crime involving\nmoral turpitude, and a crime of violence, in the\ndefinition, is one that involves the use of physical\nforce against person or property of another.\nAnd so, it doesn't need to be aggravated in\nany other sense. It doesn't need to be -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was Judulang's crime a\ncrime involving violence?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, it was a crime -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean a crime of moral\nturpitude.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, it was. But what I'm\ntrying to say, Justice Ginsburg, is that Petitioner's\napproach of looking to the conviction is inconsistent\nwith the board's repeated -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't look to the\nconviction. That may be his approach. My approach is\nlook to the category.\nMR. GANNON: And, Justice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look to the category. And\nthe category here is not -- you know, the category isn't\ncrime; the category is what kind of a crime. And this\nis a crime of violence. In the statute, or if you look\nat what was charged, it's called voluntary manslaughter.\nEither way, I would think those categories as categories\nfall within \"crime of moral turpitude.\"\nMR. GANNON: Well, but the category that is\nrelevant is the crime of violence. And as I just\ndiscussed with Justice Ginsburg, there are indeed crimes\nof violence that satisfy the statutory definition in 18\nU.S.C. 16 -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not -- you're\nnot -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I hear his answer? I\nwas very interested in the question. It seemed to make\na good point.\nMR. GANNON: Well, if I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. GANNON: If I could finish up on the\nfirearms analogy, I think that this is responsive,\nJustice Breyer, to your point about looking at the\ncategory, and that in Montenegro, the board specifically\nconcluded that this offense, assault with a firearm -\nit's a firearms offense, but because we've already\nconcluded that as a categorical matter, firearms\noffenses aren't on the list of exclusion crimes; we\ndon't care and we're not going to ask ourselves whether\nit could have been a crime involving moral turpitude.\nThe board applied that same reasoning again\nin a 1995 opinion, in Espinoza. We quote all of these\nopinions on page 41 of our brief.\nAnd so, in these two categories, firearms\noffenses and visa fraud offenses, both of which could\noften involve moral turpitude on an -- in any individual\ncase -- that such offenses could involve moral\nturpitude, just like a crime of violence may well\ninvolve moral turpitude. And yet, the board concluded\nthat because as a categorical matter, this is not\ncomparable to any ground of exclusion, it was going to\nsay that it was not going to extend this relief, that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's let Justice\nSotomayor jump in now with her question.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I go back to\nJustice Breyer's question. What you just said made\nlogical sense; the category of gun possession doesn't go\nin. Visa fraud doesn't become a crime of moral\nturpitude. But we have cases that have said,\ngenerically, manslaughter, which involves violence, is a\ncrime of moral turpitude. Others have qualified sexual\nabuse of a minor. I don't know of anyone who would\nthink that that category of crimes, whether you call it\nindecency, touching, or -- we've already said touching\nalone may not qualify, but my point is you now are\nsaying, I think -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that\naggravated violent felons is an entire category, and\nanything that falls under that label can't be a ground\nof exclusion.\nMR. GANNON: No -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's how I read your\ncategorical comparison now.\nMR. GANNON: No, the board has made it clear\nfrom as early as the Meza decision that it would look\ninto the specific category within the definition of\naggravated felony -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, now -\nMR GANNON: -- in order to do a categoric -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why is manslaughter\nnot a crime of moral turpitude?\nMR. GANNON: Because that's not the category\nin the aggravated felony definition that we're talking\nabout. What we're talking about is crimes of violence.\nThat's the category. And so -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Gannon, suppose\nthis: Suppose that on the exclusion side, you have this\ncategory of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose on\nthe deportation side, which I think is right, you have a\ncategory called crimes of violence, and you also have a\ncategory called crimes of moral turpitude. There's a\ntime limit on that.\nMR. GANNON: We do have that category here.\nRight.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That's right. Suppose that\nyou -- the government could have slotted manslaughter\ninto either of those categories on the deportation side.\nAnd I understand that there's a dispute about whether it\ncould have, but let's suppose it could have. So, if\nmanslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a\ncrime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the\ncategory on the exclusion side.\nBut if the same crime is categorized in a\ndifferent way by the government, then it does match on\nthe exclusion side. So, what sense does that make? The\ngovernment's decision about how to categorize a given\noffense on the deportation side is going to determine\nwhether a person gets relief.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that there's no\ndispute about that between us and Petitioner. If\nsomebody had a firearms offense -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The Petitioner just says -\nMR. GANNON: -- it could have been charged\neither way.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The Petitioner just says we\nlook to manslaughter, and we ask whether that qualifies\na person for relief on the exclusion side -\nMR. GANNON: And what I'm trying -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you're saying, no,\nfirst, we have to put manslaughter in a category on the\ndeportation side, and then we have to match that to the\ncategory on the exclusion side. And what I'm asking you\nis kind of what sense does that make? Doesn't\neverything depend on which category you put manslaughter\ninto?\nMR. GANNON: Well, what it -- the reason it\nmakes sense is because the statute only provides for\nrelief from grounds of inadmissibility or exclusion.\nBy its terms -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You are so far from the\nstatute, Mr. Gannon, you can't even tell what's closer\nto the statute. I mean, you are miles away from the\nstatute.\nMR. GANNON: Well, the way -- the way this\ndoctrine developed, Justice Kagan, is that it developed\nin the context where the board recognized that the\nstatute only applied to waiver of grounds of\nexcludability, and it extended that to deportation cases\nwhen it was on the basis of the same grounds that could\nhave been presented in an exclusion proceeding.\nAnd so, that's all we're trying to do here,\nis to continue without -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what your position\nmeans that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who\nmakes the charge, because take Mr. Judulang, he could\nhave been categorized as deportable because he committed\na crime involving moral turpitude, or he could have been\ncategorized as somebody who committed an aggravated\nfelony. It is then totally in the hands of the person\nwho is making the charge whether there will be a match\nor not.\nMR. GANNON: The reason why that's so is\nbecause the thing that is going to be waived at the end\nof the proceeding is the -- is the ground of\ndeportation. And so, if the ground of deportation is\nfor an aggravated felony crime of violence, then it\nneeds to be one for which there's 212(c) eligibility.\nThe same would be true if it were a firearms offense.\nIf it were -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't -- if\nthe -- if the officer labels the manslaughter in this\ncase a crime involving moral turpitude, then there's a\nmatch -\nMR. GANNON: That's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he labels it\naggravated felony crime of violence, then there's no\nmatch. So, it's up to the charger whether there will be\nthis match or not.\nMR. GANNON: That's true. It's also true in\nthe firearms offense cases and the visa fraud offense\ncases, because those are all instances in which,\ndepending on the circumstance of the offense and\ndepending upon what it was charged, the board has\nconcluded that the 1546 offense is divisible. Some of\nthose crimes are involving moral turpitude; some of them\nare not. And I -- and so -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But this isn't a question\nabout the history, Mr. Gannon. Even if we assume that\nyou are right about the history, this is a question\nabout whether this is an arbitrary system, and where\nyou're devising it from and what lies behind it.\nMR. GANNON: And I think that this is not\nonly consistent with the history; it's consistent with\nthe text of the regulation that Petitioner is invoking\nhere, which makes it clear that what is being waived is\na ground of exclusion or deportability or removability.\nAnd so, what's relevant is whether the\nground of removability is the aggravated felony crime of\nviolence ground or the crime involving moral turpitude\nground. Depending on which ground it is, that's what\nhe's seeking relief for -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- then you have to\nsay, yes, you can have somebody who would get a waiver\nof inadmissibility for a crime and the very next day be\nput in deportation without any waiver for that same\ncrime.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we have no cases in which\nthat has happened. And the cases in which the board\nsaid that that result would be clearly repugnant were\nones in which there was a comparable ground. The board\nwas saying that if you get 212(c) relief -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm giving you -\nMR. GANNON: -- on a ground of exclusion -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- these categories -\nMR. GANNON: Pardon?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: These categories.\nMR. GANNON: No, there -- there are no cases\nthat address that principle in the context where there\nis no comparable ground. And if -- if I could just make\none point about this claim of Petitioner's in his reply\nbrief, that he could have been subject to a charge of\ndeportability on the basis of a crime involving moral\nturpitude, I would caution the Court against relying on\nthat for two reasons, one factual and one legal.\nOne is that there's no factual basis in the\nadministrative record to -- to talk about this 1987 trip\nto the Philippines. We do have evidence from outside\nthe record that makes us believe that it occurred, but\nthe statute that provides for judicial review here of\nthe order of removability in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A)\nspecifically says that the determination needs to be\nmade on the basis of the administrative record. And the\nonly evidence in the record about that trip is actually\na statement from Petitioner's mother that says that it\noccurred in 1989, the year after the crime.\nBut even assuming that -- that the trip\nhappened, in light -- as I said, we do believe on the\nbasis of evidence outside the record that it did occur\n-- there's a legal reason why I would caution the Court\nagainst assuming that that means the Petitioner could\nhave been deportable for a crime involving moral\nturpitude, and that's the so-called Fleuti doctrine.\nUnder this Court's 1963 decision in Rosenberg v. Fleuti,\nwhich is actually relevant to a case on which you\ngranted certiorari a couple of weeks ago, this Court\nconcluded that if an LPR takes a brief, casual, and\ninnocent trip outside the country and returns to the\nUnited States, that will not trigger an entry upon his\nreturn to the United States.\nAnd so, I think it's very likely that under\nNinth Circuit precedent, in 1989 when Petitioner was\npleading guilty to his voluntary manslaughter charge, he\nwouldn't have had any reason to think that he was doing\nso within 5 years of when he committed -- when he\nentered the country for purposes of the statute.\nI think it's also -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back to second\non this very interesting -- suppose I say, okay, I\nconcede. I'd only do it for the sake of this question.\nYou're absolutely right in your categorization. The\nright category is crime of violence. And then I look at\nthe statute, which is 8 U.S.C. 1101(43), which you\nprobably know by heart, and I look at the definition of\ngun crimes, and I look at crime of violence.\nMy non-schooled reaction is, well, gun\ncrimes, I can see why they said that wasn't really a\ncrime of moral turpitude, because there are a lot of\nregistration requirements, there are all kinds of\ndifferent things that drug -- gun dealers have to do,\nand you could commit that crime in various ways that\ndon't involve moral turpitude. I can understand that,\nsort of. At least, I could see how somebody else might\nhave understood it that way.\nNow, I think crimes of violence, I say, hey,\nI am having trouble here. Why don't you try to list a\nfew crimes of violence that when they come into the\ncountry you're going to say, oh, that wasn't a crime of\nmoral turpitude? And by the way, I am not asking you to\nlist specific examples; I am asking you to list\ncategories. List categories of crimes of violence that\nwhen the person comes in, you're going to say, hmm, no\nmoral turpitude there.\nMR. GANNON: The chief examples are the ones\nthat the board gives in the Brieva-Perez opinion, which\nare simple assault, which has -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's not a crime of -\nthat's not a moral turpitude, simple assault? You're\ngoing to just hit somebody?\nMR. GANNON: That's correct. It is not a\ncrime involving moral turpitude.\nNeither is non-residential burglary which\ninvolves force against -- against property, which would\ntherefore satisfy the definition. This is an opinion\nthat -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Burglary -- isn't burglary\nwhere it might be an occupied building?\nMR. GANNON: If it were an occupied\nbuilding, if it were a dwelling -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, no. A warehouse.\nI am being a little quibbling now. Of course, my basic\nconcern -\nMR. GANNON: In the Ninth Circuit, burglary\nof a residential dwelling that's occupied is not a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, really? Okay.\nMR. GANNON: In -- in a case that's cited in\nthe concurring opinion -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, there are some. There\nare some.\nMR. GANNON: There certainly are.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is a little odd, but\nwhat I'm afraid of -\nMR. GANNON: They tend to be minor -- minor\n-- more minor offenses.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What I'm afraid of\nis this: That once you put this in your category, that\nyou say crimes of violence are not crimes of moral\nturpitude, then to a large extent you have said\ngood-bye, Justice or Attorney General Robert Jackson.\nMR. GANNON: I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying good-bye to\nJackson and Thornburgh, because you have driven such a\nwedge between these two statutes that there's hardly\nanybody who would be able to qualify for the Jackson-\nThornburgh approach to this statute.\nMR. GANNON: I just -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I overstate slightly, but\nyou see my point.\nMR. GANNON: I see your point,\nJustice Breyer, and if you look at all of the cases that\npredate the era that we're talking about here, they all\n-- almost all involve two categories of offenses, drug\ntrafficking or controlled substance offenses and crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude, things that were actually\ncharged under the ground of deportation for crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude.\nAnd here, Congress added aggravated felonies\nto the deportation side of the ledger but didn't add it\nto the exclusion side of the ledger. And then it\nrepeatedly expanded the definition of \"aggravated\nfelony\" between 1988 and 1996 in ways that made these\noffenses treatable in different ways for purposes of\ndeportation than they were for exclusion.\nAnd as a category -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I keep going back\nto my question. There's only one category now,\naggravated violent felony. That's the only category\nyou're looking at. It doesn't matter, in your judgment.\nThat -- that is your test.\nMR. GANNON: That's -- I disagree, Justice\nSotomayor. If -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it qualifies as an\naggravated violent felon, it cannot be a crime of moral\nturpitude.\nMR. GANNON: I disagree with that -- the\nfact that that's the category we're looking at.\nWe're looking inside the definition of\naggravated felony, to the particular ground which is\ncrimes of violence. And then what we are saying is that\nthe analysis needs to be done at a categorical level.\nAnd the board has said that you cannot get a 212(c)\nwaiver from a ground of deportability unless that ground\nof deportability is substantially equivalent to a\nwaivable ground of exclusion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go back to a\nconcrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.\nSomeone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary\nmanslaughter. And would an officer at the airport say\nyou're not admittable; that's a crime involving moral\nturpitude? Could the officer say that?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, the officer could say\nthat, and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And could he then waive\nthat ground under 212(c)?\nMR. GANNON: Generally, yes. I mean,\nthere's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now -\nMR. GANNON: We're talking about pre-1996\noffenses.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now let's assume that he\ndid, that he waives that crime of moral turpitude.\nWould the government now put that individual in\ndeportation and say this voluntary manslaughter doesn't\nmeet the statutory counterpart test. So, for that very\ncrime, we're going to deport you, even though we let you\nin, because it's a crime involving violence.\nMR. GANNON: We don't have any examples like\nthat, and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you? Can you?\nMR. GANNON: I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that where your test\nleads you?\nMR. GANNON: Well, ultimately, even the\ndurability of the 212(c) waiver wouldn't necessarily\nhave protected somebody against a subsequent proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, in your\nbrief, I thought you'd conceded that.\nMR. GANNON: We -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- just the example\nthat Justice Sotomayor gave. Somebody is declared\ninadmissible because it's a crime. This manslaughter or\naggravated felony crime of violence is on the\nadmissibility side a crime involving moral turpitude.\nSo, he's allowed in. And then he's in and he's declared\ndeportable, and he can't get a waiver because there's no\nanalogue. I thought your brief said, yes, that's the\nconsequence of our argument; however, prosecutors would\nnot seek deportation if inadmissibility had been waived.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we -- the brief did say\nthat this is hypothetically possible. I'm aware of -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. GANNON: -- no instances in which it has\nhappened, and we don't have a board decision about what\nthe effect of the earlier waiver would be on a\nnon-comparable ground in a subsequent deportation\nproceeding. And I do think, however, that, regardless\nof the prosecutorial discretion point here, even if the\nboard were to conclude that the 212(c) waiver carried\nacross and would prevent this alien from being\ndeportable in a subsequent proceeding, an important\npurpose would still be served by encouraging the alien\nto get himself into exclusion proceedings at the\nbeginning, because that is what several courts have\nconcluded would be a rational basis for differential\ntreatment in encouraging aliens to seek 212(c) waivers\nin the exclusion context.\nCongress -- when it adopted the aggravated\nfelony definition and repeatedly expanded it, it was\nconcerned about criminal aliens in this country and ways\nto get them out of the country. And so, to the extent\nthat 212(c) relief still is available for certain LPRs\nwho meet certain threshold criteria and are being\ndeported on the basis of crimes that would have made\nthem inadmissible, if an alien then wants to seek 212(c)\nrelief, he can get himself into an exclusion proceeding,\nor he could seek advanced parole on the I-191 form that\nPetitioner reprints at -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're also telling me\nthat -- I didn't know this; I learn something in every\nargument -- that if we have Jack the cat burglar who was\nburgling dozens of office buildings -- and abroad -- and\nassaults people and hits them over the head or whatever\nwith his -- I guess with his fists, that we have no way\nof excluding that person, should he try -- I've heard\ncriticisms of our immigration policy, but this seems\nsurprising to me, that we have no way of excluding that\nperson who is filled with simple burglary of office\nbuildings and assaults.\nMR. GANNON: Well, there was a separate\nground which is two crimes, any two criminal offenses.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. He has only\ndone it once; we have to let him in.\nMR. GANNON: If he has only done it once,\nthen it may well be that it wouldn't qualify. But the\nboard has repeatedly declined to consider whether such a\ncrime, which would be -- could potentially be a ground\nfor exclusion, would automatically guarantee that -\nthat the alien could receive a waiver of any ground of\ndeportability based on the same conviction. And -- and\nwhen my friend -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it they haven't\ndecided. So -\nMR. GANNON: No, I'm saying that the board\nrepeatedly declined to apply this analysis in the\ncontext of firearms offenses and visa fraud offenses,\nwhere aliens said: My offense is a crime involving\nmoral turpitude; I could have been charged with being --\nI could have been excluded on the basis of my visa fraud\noffense or my assault with a firearm, because assault\nwith a firearm is a crime involving moral turpitude.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask just a\npractical question? Does this issue go away finally\nwhen there are no more St. Cyr people? Meaning is there\nany -- there's no 212(c) anymore.\nMR. GANNON: Well, there -- there's a new\nprovision, cancellation of removal, which indisputably\njust simply is unavailable to anyone with a aggravated\nfelony conviction.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. GANNON: And -- and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, really the issue\nthat we have at the moment is whether your decision to\neffect what has happened now in the past, to do what\nCongress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr,\nis just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence,\nit just doesn't qualify anymore.\nThat's what you are doing. You're not\ngiving 212(c) to anybody anymore.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we're giving it to aliens\nlike this, aliens who -- who have older convictions,\npre-1996 guilty pleas -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you were just saying\nif they're aggravated -- if they've committed an\naggravated crime of violence, they're not getting it\nanymore.\nMR. GANNON: That -- that is if it's a crime\nthat was -- a conviction that occurred after 212(c) was\nrepealed. So, for instance, in this case, if on remand\nthe board considers one of the other charge grounds of\ndeportation -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this whole thing\ngoes away once all the St. Cyr people have.\nMR. GANNON: Yes, because 212(c) only lives\non by virtue of St. Cyr right now. And I -- but -- but\nI do want to stress that this -- I think Justice Kagan\nwas correct to point out that this was clarifying a\nprevious state of the law. We believe that there were\nvery clear principles in the cases that are cited on\npage 41 of our brief, that the board had refused to do\nthe analysis on -- on a conviction level as opposed to a\ncategorical level. And my friend keeps quoting Attorney\nGeneral Thornburgh's opinion in Hernandez-Casillas for\nhis re-adoption of the nunc pro tunc doctrine, but I\nwould like to point out that the Attorney General there\nmade it very clear in his holding that he was\nreaffirming the statutory counterpart doctrine as it\nexisted at the time, and at page 291 of his opinion, he\nsays that he rejects the board's attempts to extend\n212(c) to, quote, \"grounds of deportation that are not\nanalogous to the grounds for exclusion listed in section\n212(c).\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he also said that\nthere are only two grounds for deportation that have no\nanalogue in the grounds for exclusion.\nMR. GANNON: That's -- you're -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Entry without inspection\nand firearms conviction.\nMR. GANNON: That -- that is what footnote 4\nof the opinion says. That's clearly an under-inclusive\nlist because it doesn't include visa fraud offensives,\nwhich had already been recognized in Wadud as being a\ncategory that did not have a comparable ground, and -\nand that was reaffirmed later in the Jimenez-Santillano\nopinion.\nMy friend quotes the Jimenez-Santillano\nopinion in -- in his reply brief for the proposition\nthat Wadud was really about the facts. This was his\nanswer to you, Justice Scalia. But if you look at the\nJimenez summary of what actually happened in Wadud, the\nother half of the sentence that's being quoted there\nsays the board in Wadud, quote, \"observed that we did\nnot need to decide whether Respondent's 1546 offense was\na crime involving moral turpitude because no ground of\ninadmissibility enumerated in section 212(a) of the Act\nwas comparable to section 1546.\" And so -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you know potentially how\nmany people may be affected by the decision in this\ncase?\nMR. GANNON: I don't have a good estimate of\nthat because we don't know how many offenders with\npre-1996 guilty pleas will end up being picked up by\nimmigration authorities and -- and charged under these\ncircumstances. You know, Petitioner is somebody who, at\n-- at the time he committed his offense, wasn't even an\naggravated felon. It's only by virtue of the\nretroactive applicability of the definition that he\nbecame an aggravated felon. And so, that makes the sort\nof St. Cyr question about his reliance a -- a bit\nperplexing here.\nAt the time when he was pleading guilty to\nvoluntary manslaughter, because it wasn't within 5 years\nof -- of entry, it wouldn't have been a crime involving\nmoral turpitude, and, therefore, it wouldn't have been a\nground for deportability. And it also was not yet an\naggravated felony. So, he had no reason to think he was\npleading guilty to a deportable offense at the time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But do you know how many\ntimes this has come up in cases over, let's say, the\npast 5 years?\nMR. GANNON: I don't know how many times\nthat -- all of the cases that are cited in Petitioner's\nbrief and -- and the amicus brief, there's a gap between\n1996 and about 2003, because of the repeal of 212(c) and\nSt. Cyr and the regulations. There was about a 7-month\nperiod after the regulations before the board decided\nBlake and Brieva-Perez.\nThere are on the order of several hundred\n212(c) applications that are being granted by the board\neach year right now, but that's with a backlog of cases,\nsome of which have been pending for -- for an incredibly\nlong time.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You said, Mr. Gannon, the\ngovernment no longer treats people differently depending\non whether they've left the country and returned or\nhaven't left at all. Mr. Fleming points out that you\nsaid the opposite in your brief opposing cert. He said\nthat -\nMR. GANNON: I -- I appreciate your chance\nto let me clarify, Justice Kagan. In our brief in\nopposition, we stated that an alien could avoid the\nstatutory counterpart rule by leaving the country. That\nmeant that by getting himself into an exclusion\nproceeding, the statutory counterpart rule then would\nnot be applicable. It didn't mean that had he left the\ncountry, come back, evaded an exclusion proceeding, and\nbeen put in a subsequent deportation proceeding, that\nthe statutory counterpart rule wouldn't apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGannon.\nMr. Fleming, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FLEMING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would begin simply by following up on the\nquestions that Justices Ginsburg and Kagan asked to my\nbrother about whether my client could have been charged\nas deportable with his conviction treated as a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude. In fact, he was. If one\nlooks at the decisions in the appendix to the petition\nfor certiorari, specifically at page 11a, it's clear\nthat his conviction is asserted not only as an\naggravated felony crime of violence, but also as a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude, and the immigration judge\nfound that he was in fact deportable with that\nconviction forming a crime involving moral turpitude.\nSo, there's no dispute here that Mr.\nJudulang's conviction falls into both categories. On\nthe issue of the factual basis of my client's\ndeportability at the time of the plea, Mr. Gannon is\ncorrect; there's nothing in the administrative record\nthat says that, and that is why this Court typically\ndoes not countenance arguments based on the facts by the\nrespondents that are raised only in the brief on the\nmerits. If anyone had suggested that this was an issue\non which a factual record needed to be developed, we\ncould have done it; it would not have been hard.\nI also want to comment on one point that Mr.\nGannon made, which is that the thing that -- that is\nwaived under 212(c) is a ground of deportation. That's\nnot correct. Section 212(c) provides relief from\ninadmissibility. It says that clearly in its text; that\nis how the regulations and the decisions have always\ntreated it. The form that immigrants are instructed to\nfill out, Form I-191, which is appended to our blue\nbrief, specifically says: State the reasons you may be\ninadmissible to the United States.\nIf a waiver of inadmissibility is granted,\nthat waiver protects the immigrant from subsequent\ndeportation based on the same conviction. That is the\nlanguage of Matter of G-A-, which the Government itself\nexcerpts in its brief; and Justice Ginsburg is correct,\nthat is -- they admit that a waiver is durable in that\nsense. If it is granted to waive inadmissibility, it\nprotects the alien from deportation on any deportation\nsubsection based on that same conviction.\nI thought it was telling, Justice Breyer, in\nreaction to your question which -- which was seeking an\nexplanation of how this scheme is reasonable, the answer\nthat counsel for the Government gave was that the BIA\nhas been consistent with firearms and visa fraud cases,\nbut there was no explanation as to how the Blake rule as\nit is now drawn is in any way a reasonable application\nof the law. I would submit for the reasons that Your\nHonor pointed out, which is that we have a number of -\nwhether one calls them convictions or whether one calls\nthem categories of crimes -- voluntary manslaughter,\naggravated burglary -- recall that we're talking about\naggravated felony crimes of violence.\nI recognize that if we talk about\nthird-degree burglary, which could be charged on the\nbasis of someone opening an unlocked door and walking\nacross the threshold, maybe that's not a crime involving\nmoral turpitude, but it is probably not an aggravated\nfelony crime of violence either, certainly not in this\nCourt's decision in Leocal.\nSo, I would submit that the Government has\nnot identified a crime that would be both an aggravated\nfelony crime of violence and yet not a crime involving\nmoral turpitude. The overlap is, I would submit, total.\nAnd even if it's not total, that is not the end of our\nargument because the board itself has said you, don't\nneed a perfect match; you just need substantial overlap.\nAnd the overlap is at the very least substantial, if not\ncomplete.\nThe crime that was charged in Brieva-Perez\nitself, unauthorized use of a vehicle under Texas law,\nhas subsequently been held by the Fifth Circuit not to\nbe an aggravated felony at all. So, Brieva-Perez on its\nown terms is no longer good law, as we point out in our\nreply brief.\nThe interest that Mr. Gannon asserted at one\npoint about getting immigrants to put themselves into\nexclusion proceedings -- this is a very important point.\nThe agency has never suggested that that is the way that\nit runs the railroad. On the contrary, it has expressly\nsaid the opposite.\nIt does not matter whether the 212(c)\napplication is filed in exclusion proceedings, in\ndeportation proceedings, or outside of proceedings\nentirely by sending a letter to the district director\nsaying: Please give me an advance waiver before I\ntravel abroad.\nThe regulations make very clear and the\ndecisions make very clear -- I quoted Matter of A-A- in\nmy opening argument -- that an application is identical\nand the relief that is given is identical, regardless of\nthe proceedings.\nFor Mr. Gannon to stand up and say that the\nagency is now creating a sharp distinction, saying that\napplications filed in exclusion are omnipotent, and\napplications filed in deportation proceedings are\nmeaningless is a clear change in the law, and it is\nunfair to apply it against immigrants like Mr. Judulang\nand others who relied on the availability of section\n212(c) as protection from removal, whether exclusion or\ndeportation in the future, when they pled guilty.\nJustice Sotomayor, your question about how\nmany people are involved here, it is difficult to\nidentify specific numbers because very often these cases\nare decided at the immigration judge level that are not\nreported. In the appendix to our petition for\ncertiorari, we identified over 160 people who have been\nsubject -- who have suffered under the Blake rule since\nBlake was decided in 2005.\nAnd part of the problem is that we are\ntalking about a group of people who have been in the\ncountry for a long time, whose convictions are dated,\nwho are law-abiding, who are reformed, and may only come\nto the attention of the authorities subsequently through\nperfectly law-abiding conduct such as applying for\nnaturalization or renewing a green card so that they -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If they weren't\nlaw-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that\nwould render them inadmissible and -\nMR. FLEMING: That would potentially -\npotentially subject them to removal, exactly. Now -\nand there might be other forms of relief, as Mr. Gannon\nmentioned. But -- that's certainly right. But a good\nnumber of the people here who have been harmed by the\nBlake rule are people who are the most deserving\ncandidates for relief. And the NIJC brief, I think,\nsets that out I think quite convincingly.\nWe would submit that the only reasonable\napproach here is the one that the agency took for years\nunder Meza and under the eight decisions that Justice\nBreyer referenced, where the immigration judges knew the\nrule, they applied it, they looked to the conviction,\nthey figured out whether the conviction would trigger\nexcludability; if it did, then the alien was entitled to\napply on the same basis and with the same effect as if\nhe had found himself in exclusion proceedings.\nThe judgment should be reversed, and Mr.\nJudulang should be entitled to file his application for\nadjudication on the merits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
