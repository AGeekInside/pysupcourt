        "content": "(11:18 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext this morning in Case 10-98, Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd.\nGeneral Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThis lawsuit seeks personal money damages\nagainst a former Attorney General of the United States\nfor doing his job, allegedly with an improper motive,\nyet the Attorney General, like the Federal prosecutor in\nIdaho who sought the material witness warrant at issue\nin this case, was performing the functions of his\noffice.\nThere are three reasons why the Petitioner\nshould not be personally liable for money damages. The\nfirst is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the\nmaterial witness warrant is integrally associated with\nthe judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity.\nTo view it any other way is to expose both line\nprosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly\nincentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad\nmotives. That is something this Court has manifestly\nresisted and for good reason, because improper motives\nare easy to allege and hard to disprove. Allowing such\nsuits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation\nand interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do\ntheir jobs.\nThe second reason is that the Fourth\nAmendment was not violated, and, therefore, qualified\nimmunity applied. There can be little doubt that the\nstatutory requirements of section 3144 were met in this\ncase, and, equally, there can be little doubt that the\nsubjective motivations of Attorney General Ashcroft or\nthe line prosecutor are thoroughly irrelevant to whether\na Fourth Amendment violation exists.\nThis Court has repeatedly rejected\nsubjectivity, explaining that otherwise time-consuming,\nvexatious, burdensome, and, indeed, destabilizing\ndiscovery and litigation would be the inexorable result.\nAnd the third reason, and the easiest\nreason, is that whatever one thinks the applicable law\nis, what it -- it was manifestly not the law in 2003\nwhen the warrant in this case was issued by a neutral\njudge in Idaho.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask whether your\nsecond reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes\nvery little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -\nis held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified\nimmunity?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Oh, no, it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once -- once you say\nthat -- that motive is not introducible with regard to\nthe qualified immunity question, and once you say that\nhe's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind\nit as to whether he was abusing it for some other\npurpose, is there any difference between absolute and\nqualified immunity?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I take it there may\nbe a difference. We think the Court should first decide\nthe absolute immunity question, which is the way that\nthis Court has historically handled questions when\nthere's an absolute immunity question and then a\nqualified immunity.\nI take it that the qualified immunity\nquestion in this case is one about whether motivations\nmatter for the Fourth Amendment; whereas the motivation\nquestion in the absolute immunity sense, as Respondents\nsee it, is -- is something broader. It's not limited to\nthe Fourth Amendment, per se. Their argument is if the\nprosecutor is -- has bad motives essentially or a\ncertain bad motive, an investigatory or purposeful bad\nmotive to engage in preventive detention, that somehow\npierces the veil of absolute immunity. That is\nsomething this Court has never accepted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the -- I\nthought the argument, rather, was that this is not as\nclose to the core of the prosecutorial function as some\nof the other functions to which we have given absolute\nimmunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is\nsuch potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute\nimmunity on this particular conduct. But I don't\nunderstand why if we agree with you on qualified\nimmunity, there is any difference whatever.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, to be sure,\nthey are now making that argument in this Court, that\nthis doesn't fall -- this isn't intimately associated -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- with the judicial\nprocess. Below, of course, they said the reverse: That\nmaterial witness warrants were associated with the\njudicial process and that the only difference is that -\nthat, here, they had a bad motive.\nSo I've talked about the bad motive point.\nNow, with respect to whether this is intimately\nassociated with the judicial process, these are material\nwitness warrants being sought in connection with an\nongoing investigation by a prosecutor. It is\nquintessentially a prosecutorial function to obtain\nthese warrants and has been for -- for hundreds of\nyears, and it's the exercise of the prosecutor's\nprofessional judgment, which is something that this\nCourt has looked to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was the prosecution already\npending when this -- when this warrant was issued?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Yes, it was. The\nindictment of Mr. Al-Hussayen was in February 2003. The\nprosecutors learned in March that Mr. Al-Kidd was about\nto board a plane and go off to Saudi Arabia for an\nunspecified length of time. They then acted\nimmediately. They went to the court and said we need\nthis warrant to secure this testimony. That is, to me,\nessentially what prosecutors do and protected by Imbler.\nTo see it any other way is to expose prosecutors to\nlawsuits for -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was Mr. Al-Kidd -- was he\nreleased after -- I understand he didn't testify at the\ntrial, and there was an acquittal, and then other\ncharges were dropped. Was Al-Kidd still in custody as a\nmaterial witness after the trial was over?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, he was\nin -- he was detained for only a period of 16 days total\nin 2003. Is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he was restrained\nmuch longer -- for 15 months.\nGENERAL KATYAL: He had travel restrictions\nplaced upon him until the trial was over and until the\ngovernment -- because after the resolution of\nMr. Al-Hussayen's case, which was acquittal on some\ncharges and a hung conviction -- a hung -- a hung\ndecision on others, the government thought about\nretrying Mr. Al-Hussayen, took it very seriously, and 20\ndays after al-Hussayen's verdict by the jury, we reached\nan agreement with them in writing that Mr. Al-Hussayen\nwould leave the country and -- and not come back, and in\nexchange we weren't going to prosecute him any further.\nAnd so, immediately -- I think quite soon after the jury\nverdict, the -- the conditions placed on Mr. Al-Kidd\nwere lifted.\nAnd I should say that the material witness\nwarrant statute laces into it a whole suite of\nsafeguards to prevent against -- as, Justice Scalia, you\npointed out -- the potential abuse for the -- for\nmaterial witnesses by prosecutors. I think Congress has\nset up several different things to prevent that. The\nfirst is, in order to get a material witness warrant,\nthe prosecutor needs to show both materiality and then\npracticability.\nThe second is that there are strict limits\nplaced on the conditions of the -- on the ability of the\nprosecutor to detain anyone. Section 3142 says that a\ndetention can only be allowed by a judge if, quote, \"no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the individual.\"\nAnd then there's a formal procedure where\nthey have a right to counsel, they have the right to\ncross-examine witnesses, to -- to present evidence, to\nproffer evidence at the hearing, and the like -- all to\nshow that they shouldn't continue to be detained.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in light of these\nrestrictions, I would like to come back to the question\nthat I understood Justice Scalia to be asking. If the\nCourt were to hold that obtaining a material witness\nwarrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the\nstatutory requirements, and in particular establishing\nmateriality, are met, why would it be necessary for the\nCourt to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a\nprosecutor seeks a material witness warrant?\nGENERAL KATYAL: For two reasons. Number\none is I think that's the way this Court has\nhistorically gone about it, probably for reasons of\nconstitutional avoidance, to not reach constitutional\nquestions if there's an absolute immunity question.\nAnd the second is, here, you have a Ninth\nCircuit decision, Justice Alito, that says that -- that\nabsolute immunity can be pierced by a prosecutor's bad\nmotive. That is something that infects not simply\nmaterial witness warrant cases but, indeed, virtually\nany case. As we point out and as the dissent below\npointed out, that kind of argument could be run by any\ndefendant who says you didn't intend to actually indict\nme, or, you didn't care about that, you really wanted to\nflip me to get testimony against some higher-up. And to\nallow defendants to make those kinds of arguments and to\nexpose line prosecutors and attorneys general to that\nform of liability is an extremely damaging proposition.\nThe -- with respect to the Fourth Amendment\nquestion about whether or not motive applies, I think\nthis Court has quite clearly said in Whren that motive\nis not -- is not something that should be looked to,\nthat the subjective motivations of the prosecutor are\nnot -- are -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's after there is\nprobable cause to suspect that criminal activity has\noccurred. And then you -- once you have probable cause,\nthey're not going to look behind probable cause.\nBut, here, the whole reason for using this\nmaterial witness statute is that there isn't probable\ncause to believe that al-Kidd did anything. The\nviolation -- there was no violation of the law. So\nWhren is different. It's a different case.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, it's\ncertainly different in -- in that respect, but I do\nthink that difference doesn't matter, because I think\nwhat Whren and Edmond and the cases were getting at is,\nis there some objective, individualized determination by\na neutral judge? And, here, as I was saying earlier,\nthere is quite clearly that laced into the 3144 statute\nitself; that is, the judge must find materiality and -\nand impracticability of the testimony. And that is a\nstandard performing, I think, a long-standing government\nfunction of making sure that testimony, important\ntestimony, is available at trial.\nSo it is not like a situation in which the\ngovernment, just on their mere say-so, can put the -\ncan detain someone on the basis of them saying, well, we\nthink this person has information. I think there are\nstrict standards placed on that, and, indeed, Federal\nRule -- Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 46 adds\nstandards to it by saying that a prosecutor must report\nto the judge every 10 days about anyone who is detained\nand assure no more detention is necessary. So that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how that would\nmake any difference to the -- at least to the absolute\nimmunity question. You wouldn't assert that there is\nabsolute immunity if there's a statute such as this, but\nthere is not if there isn't. I mean, either this is\ncore prosecutorial function for which he can't be sued\nor it isn't. So what difference does this statute make\nas far -- as far as absolute immunity is concerned?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nI was just answering Justice Ginsburg's question about\nqualified immunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I imagine one point about\nthe statute might be that the statutes, going all the\nway back to 1789, do reflect that this is a\nprosecutorial function to the extent there is any doubt.\nSo, for example, the 1846 statute said that an\nattorney -- excuse me, an attorney of the United States\nmust apply for a material witness warrant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So for us to agree with you\non absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe\nthat even if there were no such statute and if a\nprosecutor simply detained somebody as a material\nwitness without any check of a -- of an independent\nmagistrate, he would be immune?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think that is correct,\nthat that is quintessentially what prosecutors do in the\nexercise of trying to get a trial -- a trial going.\nNow -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose that a\nprosecutor reads the statute, there must be an affidavit\nthat says this witness is material. And there is\nirrefutable evidence that the prosecutor said to\ncolleagues and others: I do not intend to try this\nperson, ever, no matter what; I just want to ask him\nquestions. In that case, has the statute been violated\nbecause he is not material?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, if the -- if the --\nI'm not sure I totally follow -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying it's this\ncase. I'm saying it's a hypothetical case.\nGENERAL KATYAL: If the evidence shows that\nthe evidence is not material, then the statute is\nviolated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason it is not\nmaterial is because the prosecutor has no intention\nwhatsoever of ever bringing this person as a witness in\nany trial.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I do think that that would\ngenerally mean that materiality would be violated. I\ncould imagine -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- some theoretical\nconstruct -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If materiality is violated,\ndoes not then that -- that prosecutor -- since he had no\nintention of bringing him to trial or of having him as a\nwitness at a trial, that prosecutor would not be immune?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Breyer, let me -\nlet me -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- yes.\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- just make sure that I\nunderstand the contours of your hypothetical. I don't\nthink that subjective motivations of the prosecutor go\nto materiality. So if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how does -- how does\nit -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Here's how I think it\nworks: So I think that Congress set up the objective\ntwo-part test to decide whether or not an arrest warrant\nwould take place, which is materiality and\nimpracticability. Now, that isn't subjective; that is\nsimply, does the person have material information that\ncan be used that -- that's relevant to the trial.\nNow, if the person has a -- the prosecutor\nhas a subjective intent that says I'm never going to use\nthis testimony, then I think that that doesn't -- that\nwill -- that will almost always reflect the fact that\nmateriality just objectively hasn't been met in a given\ncase, but theoretically I could imagine a circumstance\nin which the prosecutor has that subjective intent but\nyet is material.\nWith respect to that, Congress has a\ndifferent safeguard at the back end, in 3144, and that\nis the language in 3144 that says a judge in the\ndetention hearing is to inquire as to whether or not the\ndetention is necessary, quote, \"if there will be a\nfailure of justice\" if the person is released.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you can't look behind\nthat, right? You can't look behind that? If the -- if\nthe judge has said it's material, that's the end of it;\nyou have absolute immunity, right?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the -\nthe defense can litigate that and appeal that set of\nissues, but I don't think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can appeal the -- the\njudge's determination that -- that it's material?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then how can you have\nabsolute immunity?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, they did, because\nwe're talking about -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you mean at the time\nit's issued?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nGENERAL KATYAL: At the time itself. But I\nthink that's an important point, Justice Scalia. With\nrespect to absolute immunity, this Court has often said\nthat it is the crucible of the trial process itself that\noften is a safeguard against abuse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what if you didn't\nhave -- again, what if you didn't have this prescribed\njudicial process?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I take it that the logic of\nthis Court's precedence is that absolute immunity would\nstill apply. And the reason for that is that absolute\nimmunity isn't some rule to just protect prosecutors\nwilly-nilly; it's to protect the public. And as this\nCourt said most recently unanimously in the Van de Kamp\ncase, that -- quoting Learned Hand -- that -- that there\nis a cost to this. No doubt that certain individuals\nwill be harmed, but the cost of rooting out the bad\napples through damages lawsuits is far worse, that it\ncauses prosecutors to flinch in the performance of their\nduties.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a difference\nbetween calling a witness at trial and arresting a\nperson. How is it a part of the prosecutorial or the\ntrial function to arrest someone? Isn't what's\nprotected absolutely is your use of that person at\ntrial, not your arrest or detention of them?\nGENERAL KATYAL: No, I do think it goes\nquite a bit further than that. I think it -- and I\nthink Burns v. Reed -- and the relevant language is at\npage 492 -- I think is -- is relevant because it says\nthat it's pretrial conduct, in order to secure the\ntestimony for trial or the like is -- is what is\nprotected as well, that it would be far too narrow to\njust focus on the trial itself; and that would be the\ncontours of absolute immunity.\nI think Justice Kennedy's opinion in Buckley\nis also instructive in this regard, because what that\nopinion says is that allowing only immunity for the\ntrial would just allow individuals to constantly replead\ntheir allegations and focus only on the pretrial conduct\nand be an end run around absolute immunity. And, again,\nabsolute immunity is important not for the prosecutor\nfor his own sake or her own sake, but because ultimately\nthat is what -- that causing -- damage liability will -\nwill make prosecutors flinch the performance of their\nduties more generally.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't -- you don't\nthink there's a reason to make prosecutors flinch\nagainst willy-nilly -- that's not what I'm -- I'm\nclaiming happened here, but if you take the point that\nyou're raising, then prosecutors can out of spite, out\nof pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive\nthey have, just lock people up.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're -- you're\nbasically saying -\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- making prosecutors\nflinch is -- is always a bad thing. What I'm referring\nto is this Court's precedents that say damages liability\non prosecutors is the wrong way to go about it because\nthe costs are too high compared to the benefits, and\nthere are other ways of dealing with that -- from\nprofessional discipline, as Malley v. Briggs and Imbler\nsaid; to -- to -- to bar actions; to the crucible of the\ntrial process itself, which is a way of dealing with\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there are procedures\nset forth in the statute, I'd say you would add, which\nyou think are not necessary, but are there in order to\nmake them flinch in a different -- in a different -\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is precisely correct.\nWe don't think those are constitutionally compelled, but\nwe do think they provide a very important safeguard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best authority\nthat at -- at common law or the common law tradition,\nthere is absolute immunity for witness -- for the\nissuance of witness warrants?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I don't think it's come up\nwith respect to public prosecutors, and so our argument\nhere, to the extent the Court reaches that question -\nand, again, it wasn't -- it wasn't raised below in the\nbrief in opposition, but if the Court wanted to reach\nthat question, I think it would be that the argument\nwould derive the same way as the arguments in this\nCourt's post-Imbler cases, which is, as long as it is\nintimately associated with the judicial function that\nthe prosecutor is doing, then absolute immunity should\nextend to that context.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then a second question,\nquite apart from immunity, just addressing the\nsubstantive constitutional issues under the statute,\nsuppose that the prosecutor has probable cause to indict\nand try the person for the crime. Suppose also that\nthere is good reason to show that he would be a material\nwitness as to another participant in the crime. Does\nthe government have any duty to proceed with the\nindictment, or can they just hold the person as a\nmaterial witness without indicting?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I do think that the\ngovernment -- I'm not sure if we have any policy with\nrespect to that, but I think that -- that we -- that at\nleast for Fourth Amendment purposes, there wouldn't be a\nviolation if the government held the person for\nessentially a dual motive, and that is what I understand\nthey have now conceded at page 31 of their brief, which\nis in dual motive cases, the government's action is\npermissible.\nIf there are no other questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Gelernt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE GELERNT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GELERNT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Dunaway, this Court emphatically\nreaffirmed the bedrock Fourth Amendment principle that a\ncriminal suspect may not be arrested, absent probable\ncause to believe there has been a law violated. The\nrule is fundamental to our traditions, is widely viewed\nas a defining feature of our country, and has been\nsteadfastly protected by this Court for more than 2\ncenturies in both good and bad times.\nThe material witness statute represents a\ndramatic departure to the rule, allowing the arrest of\nuncharged, innocent, even cooperative people. If a\nmaterial witness arrest is constitutional, it can only\nbe because its purpose is to secure testimony and not to\npreventively detain and investigate the witness himself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you acknowledge that it\nis then constitutional? Your -- your opening comments\nmake me think you don't even acknowledge that it's\nconstitutional then?\nMR. GELERNT: Justice Scalia, we are not\npressing that argument. I would say that based on the\nlegal historian's brief there is a strong argument to be\nmade that it is not constitutional, with respect at\nleast to cooperative witnesses. The statute the Framers\nenacted in 1789 would not allow the arrest of any\nwitness unless they came voluntarily before the\nmagistrate and refused to even promise to return. Not\neven a surety or a -- a surety or a bond was allowed.\nSo we do think there is a strong argument, but we are\nnot pressing that argument.\nOur argument is that it cannot be used for\nulterior purposes. And I just want to pick up, if I\ncan, with Justice Breyer's hypothetical that he posed to\nthe government, which is of course our hypothetical.\nThe government started out this case throughout the\nlower courts and in the opening brief saying purpose is\nwholly irrelevant. This is Whren, even though Whren is\nprobable cause to believe a law has been violated; this\nis Whren, purpose is wholly irrelevant.\nWe posed a hypothetical which we actually\nthink is this case and is consistent with our factual\nallegations, that the sole reason this arrest was made\nwas not to secure testimony but to preventively detain\nand investigate someone for whom there was no probable\ncause or violation of the law.\nThat is -- is a difficult situation I think\nto reconcile with Whren, I think an impossible situation\nto reconcile with Whren, or with the text or history of\nthis statute.\nThe government has now come back and trying\nto have it both ways and saying, well, the statute\nwouldn't naturally allow that. But if purpose is -- as\nJustice Breyer pointed out, if purpose is truly\nirrelevant why they want to make the arrest, the\ngovernment should have answered \"that would be fine.\nThe only things we need to satisfy are the objective\ncomponents of materiality and impracticability.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is this a -- is this a\nrealistic hypothetical that you've posed? Now, in order\nto detain someone under the material witness statute,\nthat person, potential witness, must have material\ntestimony, not just relevant testimony, material\ntestimony, testimony that would be of some importance in\nthe criminal prosecution. So your hypothetical is a\nsituation in which there is a witness and this witness\nhas important testimony that could be used in a pending\ncriminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no\ninterest in calling that person as a witness.\nHow often is that going to arise?\nMR. GELERNT: Well, Justice Alito, I -- I\nthink a few points, one is just as an initial matter.\nThe statute has not actually been interpreted to go\nbeyond relevance, in the way you're posing it.\nInterestingly, earlier statutes actually said the\ntestimony needed to be necessary. And so, that's -\nthat's actually an important watering down.\nBut putting that aside for the moment, we\nthink that what -- it -- it did happen in this case, it\nhappened after 9-11, I think that goes to the crux of\nour case here. We are not trying to fiddle with the use\nof the material witness statute in the every day\ncontext, and I think that's the point the Federal\nprosecutor's brief is making.\nWhat we are saying is simply that the\nprinciple has to be that if you do encounter that\nextreme case, this Court should not bless the situation\nwhere it literally can be used as a preventive -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem, and\nit's, I think, the problem that I think Whren\nhighlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily\nbe made in every case under the material witness statute\nis that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the\ncase has to proceed so that we can prove that.\nOne of the ways we prove that is by asking\neverybody who is involved in the process. Why did you\ndo this? What was your intent? I mean, the whole\npurpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff\ndoesn't happen.\nMR. GELERNT: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but\nlet me -- let me say that I think I -- I understand\nWhren, I obviously don't want to tell the Court about\nits own cases, but is that it was drawing a conceptual\nline, that the first point about Whren, and I think the\nfundamental point, was the conceptual point that as the\nWhren court put it, only an undiscerning reader would\nconflate cases in which there was probable cause of a\nviolation of the law with cases in which there wasn't.\nSo I think the Whren court is not saying we\nwouldn't look at purpose. I think that's the teaching\nof the special needs cases.\nNow, to your practical question about why\nwould this be hard to allege? I actually think that\nthis is one of those unique situations which it would be\nvery difficult to allege. Take the government's cases,\nfor example, that they've cited, like Daniels and Betts,\nthe material witness cases, you have witnesses being\narrested, not showing up for trial. As the court of\nappeals made clear in those cases, they were the main\nwitnesses, not showing up on the day of the trial or\nright before trial.\nIt would be virtually impossible for those\nwitnesses to turn around and say the only reason I was\narrested was for investigative purposes. And I think\nthat on top of the fact that this statute is used very\nrarely, I mean what we have pointed out is other than in\nimmigration cases, which the person is already subject\nto custody, there are only a few hundred each year.\nAnd again, I think what the Green brief is\nsaying by the Federal prosecutors is, look, the settled\nunderstanding of this statute among line prosecutors has\nalways been, you use it to secure testimony. Maybe\nthere's a windfall in the back of your mind that this\nperson might be a suspect, but you certainly can't use\nit where you have no intention of using the testimony.\nI think then the limitations on this statute become\nmeaningless. I mean, take -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So every time the\nprosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for\na variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this\nwasn't designed to elicit testimony?\nMR. GELERNT: No, no, we don't think so,\nMr. Chief Justice. I -- I think what we have -- we have\nsaid is that calling the witness or not calling the\nwitness can't be determinative. I think one reason is\nyou wouldn't want to create a perverse incentive to have\nprosecutors simply call the witness just to cover\nthemselves. So I think you would have to allege much\nmore, and I think that's what we have done.\nI think there is an entire set of\nallegations with respect to Mr. Al-Kidd, and they fit a\nnational pattern. And I would importantly say in the\nquestions presented, the government raised an Iqbal\nclaim as to plausibility only as to a small part of this\ncase which is no longer part of the case, which is, was\nMr. Ashcroft involved in the specific statements in this\nspecific affidavit.\nThey did not allege that the allegations of\na pretextual policy were implausible. So it is not\nbefore this court, it is not a question presented, and I\nthink it is telling that the government didn't raise it.\nThey are sitting on all the information about what\nhappened after 9-11 as a policy matter, and they did not\nclaim it was implausible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just a point of detail.\nI -- I may not be recalling correctly. You said this\nstatute is rarely used. I thought there were 4,000\nmaterial witness hearings a year. Is that mostly\nbecause of the immigration?\nMR. GELERNT: Yes, Justice Kennedy, and I\napologize if I wasn't clear. That what the -- what the\ncourt of appeals showed and what the statistics also\nshow is that roughly 92 percent of the cases are\nimmigration cases, where the person is already subject\nto custody, and there wouldn't be any need to use it in\nthat pretextual way.\nSo what we're talking about is a few hundred\neach year throughout the country, and again when it's\nused properly, it's going to be virtually impossible to\nallege something like this.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we -- do we -- do we\nhave statistics for the States, how many States hold -\nhow many people are held under State material witness\nstatutes?\nMR. GELERNT: We have -- we have looked for\nthose, Justice Kennedy. We have not been able to find\nthem. What we do know about the States, though is that\nmore than 30 of the States have statutes that are much\nmore restrictive than the Federal Government, because\nwhat they do is they follow what the framers did in\n1789, which is to say the witness has to be given an\nopportunity to comply, and that's what the framers did.\nYou have to ask the witness if they will continue to\ncomply. If they won't -- or you have to make a showing\nof why it's impossible to ask them.\nSo, I think in many States it won't be a\nproblem. I think actually, you know, the State issue is\nan important one because what the Federal Government is\narguing here is, of course, well, our prosecutors are\nvery well supervised. Well, that -- that doesn't take\ninto account if there is a deliberate attempt to misuse\nit.\nBut I also think what we're looking at are\nStates, local counties, cities where there may not be\nthe resources necessary to put checks on, and what the\ngovernment's asking is for this Court to hold that as\nlong as you can make the minimal showings of\nimpracticability and materiality, which don't even\nrequire the evidence to be important or that the witness\nbe uncooperative, you then can have any purpose you\nwant. So you could have States, cities, local counties\nsaying every member of this gang or every member of this\nbusiness must know some information about the person\nthat's been indicted.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the\nConstitution does not allow a material witness to be\ndetained, so long as the witness says in court that he\nor she will show up for trial, no matter how much\nevidence there is that this person poses a great risk of\nflight? If the person says in court, I will be there,\nthat's the end of it, the person cannot be detained?\nMR. GELERNT: Do I think the Constitution\nrequires that?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. GELERNT: I think it probably does, but\nwe are not taking a position on that. I mean, what we\nare basically saying is that it is out of whack\nhistorically. It wasn't until the mid 1900s where that\ncould happen, where even if they said they would come\nback, you could hold them. So I think it's out of whack\nhistorically, and there may be a real constitutional\nargument.\nWe are not pressing it. We are simply\nsaying that if it's used for its proper purpose, then we\nare going to assume it's constitutionality, which the\nNinth Circuit did, but it can't be that it can be used\nas a preventive detention. And I think any reasonable\nofficial -- and I want to go to the qualified immunity\nif I could -- would have seen that, because I think the\nanalysis would have been the following. You would have\npulled out Dunaway, and you would have seen that you\nneed probable cause to arrest someone, probable cause of\nwrongdoing.\nAnd you would have then said, well, we don't\nhave probable cause of wrongdoing, so you would have\npulled out Whren then, because Whren talked about\npretext. What Whren would have told you is do not\nconflate cases in which there's probable cause of\nwrongdoing with cases in which the court has granted an\nexemption from the probable cause -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You might turn out -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you were writing\na law review article, you might have done that. But\nwe're talking about an officer. I think the first thing\nyou would do is say, well, let me see these material\nwitness statute cases, and what would he have found?\nMR. GELERNT: Well, I think what he would\nhave found, Your Honor, is that the Court has not\nspecifically -- I grant that it has not specifically\nruled on the Fourth Amendment, but what he would have\nfound in Barry and the other cases, is that the Court\nrepeatedly, repeatedly referred to statute as a means of\nsecuring testimony.\nSo I think the reasonable official would\nhave said to themselves, well, it's clear under the\nFourth Amendment that I don't have probable cause, but\nmaybe the statute is allowing me to do it.\nNow, first of all, it statute can't\nauthorize a Fourth Amendment violation. But putting\nthat aside, just a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, again, you're\ntalking about the officer, he reads the statute and then\ndoesn't say, well, but maybe the statute's\nunconstitutional, so I need to do more research?\nMR. GELERNT: Exactly, Your Honor. And I\nthink what the research would have been done, they would\nhave looked at Barry and all this Court's other cases\nand would have specifically said it's to secure\ntestimony, and then I think a reasonable official would\nhave looked at the text of the statute, everything in\nthe text of the statute is about securing testimony,\nincluding the deposition requirement, you must be\nreleased if your deposition is taken, you must have a\ndeposition.\nAll of those things do not suggest -- if the\ngovernment's interests could be simply we want to hold\nthis person because for preventive detention reasons,\nnone of the statute would make sense. I think that a\nreasonable official could not have turned to this\nstatute and said, yes, I'm looking at the statute, and\nit seems like I can use it for whatever reason I want.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the eight -\neight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing\nen banc below were just being unreasonable? It would\nhave been unreasonable for an officer making this\ndetermination to agree with eight judges from the Ninth\nCircuit?\nMR. GELERNT: I think, Your Honor, the --\nMr. Chief Justice, the only way I can answer that is to\nsay this Court has -- has never made determinant of\nwhether there are dissents. I mean, take the Brogue in\nthis Court, two justices of this Court descended on\nmerits and yet you still found that the law was clearly\nestablished.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What we said in\nWilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a\nconstitutional question, it is unfair to subject public\nemployees to money damages for picking the losing side\nof the controversy.\nMR. GELERNT: I mean, but I think Brogue\ngoes the other way. Ultimately, all I can say,\nMr. Chief Justice, is I think that the -- the fact that\nthere were dissenters can't be dispositive, and\nultimately this -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I agree\nwith -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same\ntime, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy\nburden on the officers in this area when do you have a\nsituation where eight judges, when they conduct their\nresearch, come out the other way. And that type of\nburden is particularly heavy when you're talking about\nif they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket. And\nif I'm the officer in that situation, I say, well, I'm\njust not going to run the risk of, you know, having to\nsell the house because I agreed with eight judges on the\nCourt of Appeals.\nMR. GELERNT: Well, Your Honor, I think -\nyou know, of course, I'm not sure it will actually come\nout of their pocket, but I get the crux of your point.\nI do think ultimately, though, that this is a situation\nwhere a reasonable official would have had to say to\nthemselves: I can use this as preventative detention.\nBecause I want to be very clear about our position and\nhow narrow it is.\nWe would concede, for purposes of this\nargument, that if they wanted to use this for dual\nmotives, then there would have been a real question\nthere. If they said, look, we want the testimony,\nthat's what the statute talks about, but we also hope\nthat maybe something else will come out of it, that's a\nclosed question. But if they would have said to\nthemselves, which is all we're saying this case is\nabout, is: Look, we don't want this testimony. In\nJustice Breyer's hypothetical, there's clear, objective\nevidence. We don't want to use this testimony, perhaps\nit's counterproductive in our case; we're not going to\nuse this testimony, but we would like to hold the\nperson. I think that is very difficult for a reasonable\nofficial to say to themselves, this statute grants me\npreventive detention powers.\nI mean, I think you would be looking at a\nstatute going back to 1789 that this Court has\nrepeatedly commented on that is only about testimony.\nYou would be saying to yourself, this statute allows me\nto engage in preventive detention even though Congress\nhas never passed a statute like that, Congress\nspecifically rejected preventive detention powers -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't think that an\nofficial reading all this Court's cases saying\nsubjective motivation is not proper in determining the\napplication of the Fourth Amendment would be able to\nthink that this would apply here, too? Subjective\nmotivation doesn't count here; what counts is whether\nthere's -- there are objective criteria that would\npermit the detention?\nMR. GELERNT: I don't think so, Justice\nAlito, respectfully. I think when you pulled out Whren,\nwhich, of course, is this Court's landmark decision on\npretext -- Whren could not have been clearer. The Court\nspecifically said only an undiscerning reader would\nconflate the two. And I think the conceptual point\nWhren was making is straightforward.\nThe Fourth Amendment says you need probable\ncause or a violation of the law to arrest someone. If\nthe government wants to walk in and ask for an exemption\nfrom that standard and says, the reason we want the\nexemption is because of the purpose of the arrest, then\nthe Court in Whren said, well, then they must adhere to\nthe purpose. Otherwise, it's simply an end-run about\nthe probable cause.\nI mean, consider two cases -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the Fourth Amendment\ndoesn't say you need probable cause. There are\nsituations where you can conduct a search without\nprobable cause. There's the Terry search. There's\nadministrative searches. There's a lot of exceptions.\nMR. GELERNT: Yes, Justice Scalia, but I\nthink -- well, the Terry -- the Terry stops, I think we\nput to one side, because as the Court in Terry said and\nas this Court has interpreted Terry, those were because\nthose were not full-scale arrests and the\nadministrative -- sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Administrative searches,\nautomobile searches, you know.\nMR. GELERNT: Absolutely, and those all fall\ninto the special needs category, and those were cases\nyou, Your Honor, in Whren distinguished as conceptually\ndifferent than when there's probable cause of a\nviolation of law, because what you yourself said in\nWhren was: Look, the government is asking for an\nexemption from the traditional Fourth Amendment standard\nand they're saying the reason we want the exemption is\nbecause of the purpose of our search.\nYou said, well, then, of course we're going\nto hold the government to that purpose. They can't tell\nus, look, we don't want to meet the Fourth Amendment\nstandard because of the purpose of what we're doing, but\nthen turn around and not adhere to the purpose.\nAnd so if you had two cases, one where\nthere's probable cause of wrongdoing and another case\nwhere there wasn't, the judge would say fine to the\nfirst one and then he would say to you, well, the second\none, you don't have probable cause. The only thing the\ngovernment could say at that point was, well, that's\ntrue, but we're not trying to investigate or prosecute\nthe person as in Dunaway. We have a different purpose.\nMaybe it's administrative. Maybe it's to secure\ntestimony. Maybe it's a roadblock. Maybe it's\nsomething else. And then if the Court said, well, fine,\nthen go ahead and do that search on less than probable\ncause, if that's your purpose, you couldn't turn around\nthen and not -- and then not adhere to that purpose. I\nmean, I think that's what we're talking about, is\nthat -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You seem to acknowledge that\nin -- a dual motive case would not violate the Fourth\nAmendment, or wouldn't necessarily violate the Fourth\nAmendment; isn't that right?\nMR. GELERNT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that a\nreasonable official would appreciate, well, it's okay\nfor me to have a dual motive, but I have to stop and\nthink: Is my interest in investigating this individual\nfurther the but-for cause of my desire to get a material\nwitness warrant? Do you think that was apparent?\nMR. GELERNT: I think it actually is, Your\nHonor, and the reason is because I think it's -- I think\nit actually gives cushion to the reasonable official,\nbecause I think once you are saying we want to secure\ntestimony, it might be very difficult, as the Chief\nJustice was pointing out, to say, well, how I do know if\nI could have ulterior motives or not? That might be a\nvery difficult situation.\nBut I think a reasonable official -- this\nCourt's proposition that this Court would have to -\nwould have to bless, based on the allegations here are,\nthe official said, look, we think we can show\nmateriality and practicability because Mr. Al-Kidd is\ntaking a trip, he is being cooperative, but he is taking\na trip and he works for the same charity. We do not\nwant the testimony. We can't use the testimony in this\ntrial. The only reason we want to do it is to hold him,\nand we don't have probable cause of a violation of the\nlaw. I think any reasonable official would have\nunderstood that as preventive detention, and there -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure why that just\ncan't be resolved under the issue of materiality. The\nmagistrate asks the prosecutor why he wants to do this,\nand he infers from what the prosecutor said that -- just\nwhat you say. Then it's not material. It's not a case.\nMR. GELERNT: That goes to the crux of, I\nthink, what is going on here. We have said that both\nthe Fourth Amendment and the materiality as well as\nother parts of the statute would deal with it precisely.\nThe government's opening brief and throughout the lower\ncourts said, no, it doesn't matter if you're going to\nuse the testimony or not or we have any intention.\nWe posed that hypothetical in our brief.\nThe government came back and said, well, maybe that\ncould be done with materiality. If the government was\ngoing to stick to their position, their conceptual\nposition, they would have come back and said, look, the\nobjective components of materiality and of\npracticability have been satisfied, because he's taking\na trip and he worked for the same charity, and who cares\nwhether -- so if the Court is prepared to put a limit\non, you have to use this for its stated purpose,\ntestimony, that's all we're asking for. I mean, the\ncase has changed now because of the concession that the\ngovernment's made on pages bottom of 15, top of 16,\nwhere they're now saying, yeah, that is a tough\nsituation, and maybe we can deal with that through the\nstatute. But that's all we're saying.\nThe Ninth Circuit understood this as a sole\nmotive case. The government understood it in their cert\npetition and in their brief to this Court as a sole\nmotive case. We have said we think the analytical test\nis a but-for, but we're prepared to go with sole motive,\nand our allegations, our factual allegations, are\nconsistent. In the proposition, we are simply saying,\nwe don't think this Court can bless it. You satisfy\npracticability in some objective way; you don't care\nwhether you're going to use the testimony, you may have\nno use for it, but it's an end-run around locking people\nup.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where did you allege that\nthe desire to detain was the sole motive for this?\nMR. GELERNT: Your Honor, I think that the\nclearest allegations are at 111 and 112 and 154 of our\ncomplaint, in the joint appendix. What we said is it\nwas not to secure testimony. And I think the Ninth\nCircuit certainly understood it that way at pages -- I\napologize -- 25A and 40A of the opinion. And the\ngovernment, in its cert petition and its brief,\nunderstood it that way in saying, we don't know how the\nNinth Circuit would deal with a mixed motive case,\nclearly suggesting that the Ninth Circuit was a sole\nmotive case; and so again, all we are saying is it\ncannot be that this statute be transformed into a\npreventive detention statute, and I think particularly\nso because the government after 9-11 specifically -- as\nthe green brief notes -- specifically asked Congress for\npreventive detention power, and that power was denied.\nWhat they granted was a very limited 7-day hold only for\nnoncitizens.\nAnd so I think what we're talking about in\nmany respects -- at a macro level is a separation of\npowers case as much as a Fourth Amendment. I think it's\nnot -- it's not dissimilar to the dialogue this Court\nhas been having in the Guantanamo cases with, look, you\nneed to go beyond the Fourth Amendment; if you think you\nneed such a fundamental change to our country's\ntraditions, Congress is going to have to take the first\nstep, we'll look at it and there will be a back and\nforth.\nBut here what happened was the preventive\ndetention powers were denied and yet the government\nstill went ahead and used the material witness statute.\nAnd again, I can't stress enough that the government did\nnot raise an Iqbal claim as to the plausibility of these\nallegations. Only now in the reply brief where they're\n-- they're trying to address a sole motive situation, or\na but-for, which is all we're asking this Court to\naddress, the government has now said the allegations are\nimplausible.\nI think that in many situations -- you know,\nwith the absolute immunity point, if I could just turn\nto that for a second -- the history, as you said,\nJustice Kennedy, the government has conceded they don't\nhave a case on their side. We have plenty of cases in\nwhich, as the historians' brief points out, and as our\nbrief points out, in which there was not immunity for\nthe arrest of a -- for the arrest of a witness, which is\nvery different than calling a witness, Justice\nSotomayor.\nAnd what we are talking about here also is\nthe government's burden. So I don't think that's\nsomething we could have -- we could have waived,\nespecially since the Ninth Circuit addressed it and put\nthe government on notice that the government came\nforward with no historical evidence; and it's not\ninconsistent with warrants generally.\nAs this Court made clear in Malley, it\nsurveyed the history of arrest warrants and said, look,\narrest warrants, there's no history; we're not going to\ngrant absolute immunity for arrest warrants. In Burns,\nJustice Scalia pointed out that there is no history with\nrespect to search warrants, and I think the history with\nrespect to material witness warrants is even clearer.\nSo what we're talking about is no history; we're talking\nabout a fairly ancillary and rarely used process to the\ncriminal justice system, and one we're talking about\nwhere there's sort of a unique confluence of factors\nwhere you have someone who is not the defendant in the\ntrial, who is a third party, and their liberty is being\ndeprived; and it's the type of statute that can be\nabused. I mean, I think the government's whole point is\nit's a dual -- it's a dual motive type statute; and so\nthat because it can be inherently abused, there has to\nbe some checks on it.\nAnd this Court has never said that you would\nhave absolute immunity for all prosecutors in all cases.\nWe are certainly not raising a motive case with respect\nto absolute immunity. What we are simply applying is\nthe Court's test in absolute immunity, which is the\nfunctional approach, you have to make that threshold\ndetermination about whether something is investigative\nor not; and I think that's the teaching of Buckley.\nTake two witness interviews. They're the same act, but\nthe prosecutor clearly can be engaged in interviews for\ndifferent reasons.\nIn Buckley, it happened to be on those facts\nthe Court believed it was investigative, based on the\nallegations in the complaint. But what if it were 2\ndays before the presentment to the grand jury? It's\nlikely the prosecutor would have assumed he had probable\ncause at that point and was prepping the witnesses.\nThose are two acts, but you have to look\nbehind them. I think there's no way around looking\nbehind. The alternative, the flip side of what the\ngovernment's asking, is: rigidly categorize every\nsingle act a prosecutor may undertake in this country\nand say it's either wholly investigatory or wholly\nprosecutorial. And I think that's a very difficult\ntest.\nI think there's no reason why district\ncourts can't make an initial determination. I think\nhere in particular, Judge -- was in a unique position to\nmake the determination. He sat at the underlying trial\nof Al-Hussayen, so he knew what testimony and what was\ngoing on. He -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're going way\nbeyond what I thought you were arguing. You're saying\nyou always have to make that determination of good\nfaith, right? In -- in all cases, including when the\nprosecution is -- is accused of -- of bringing a\nprosecution purely for harassment purposes?\nMR. GELERNT: No, Your Honor. And I -- I --\nJustice Scalia, I apologize if my argument was going\nbeyond.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought you\nwere saying.\nMR. GELERNT: I think what's going on here\nis there's a unique set of factors with respect to\nmaterial witness, not the least of which is the history\nwith respect to both material witness arrests and\nwarrants generally, and I think there's been no\ncounter-history by the government. I think back -\nJUSTICE ALITO: We're dealing here with a\nBivens action?\nMR. GELERNT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Under what theory is the\nhistory of immunity at some point in the 19th century\nrelevant to the scope of the immunity that should be\navailable in a -- in a Bivens action? What's the theory\nfor that?\nMR. GELERNT: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I\ndon't know that I have an independent first principles\ntheory. I think this Court has said repeatedly that you\nwill keep the immunities coterminous and you will look\nto the history in both cases. So that's the Butz case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does that make any sense? I\ncan understand it with respect to 1983, on the theory\nthat when Congress passed the predecessor of that\nstatute it implicitly intended to adopt the immunities\nthat were available at the time; but when this Court\ninvented the Bivens claim -- in when -- 1971 or\nwhatever -- that the Court -- the Court was -- committed\nitself to recognizing only those immunities that were\navailable at the time when 1983 was adopted?\nMR. GELERNT: I think, you know, part of\nwhat the Court's answer is, it's a practical concern.\nThat it's just too difficult to have different\nimmunities, and the Court -- so the Court has repeatedly\nreaffirmed that, and I think from a policy standpoint, a\npractical standpoint, it's felt that that's the right\nanalysis, and there has to be some way to tether the\nimmunity analysis; and history is ultimately, I think -\nwhat the Court has said it's a necessary though not\nsufficient, and that once you sort of unmoor it from\nhistory, it becomes very difficult to keep the two.\nSo I think what we're talking about here is\na -- a statute that had enormous consequences. It's\nthird parties who have been cooperative, even, who have\ndone nothing wrong, that end up in jail, and to say that\nthere is going to be absolute immunity is very\ndangerous. This Court has repeatedly said that the\nthumb has to be on the scale against absolute immunity.\nThat's an extraordinary protection, and if there's\nanywhere where there needs to not be complete\ninsulation, it would be where you have third parties,\nand -- who are going to jail.\nThe only other case, prosecutorial immunity\ncase this Court has had where it was a third party and\nnot the actual defendant was Mitchell, and the Court\ndenied absolute immunity.\nAll the other cases, some of which you have\ndenied absolute immunity, some of which you have\ngranted, it's been the defendant in the full judicial\nprocess. Here we're talking about third parties after\n9-11 who repeatedly went to jail. I think the\nallegations are very clear that it's at least but-for -\nwe think sole -- but certainly far more than dual\nmotive. People were held -- half the people were held\nmore than 30 days, even though the statutory presumption\nis 10 days. Many people were held for months. They\nwere arrested at gunpoint. They were not immunized;\nhalf the people were not called to testify.\nIt went on in cities all over the country,\npeople being held under horrendous conditions for long\nperiods of time, interrogated about their own\nactivities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral, you have 10 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you. This is a\nsimple case. It's not about Guantanamo, it's not about\nseparation of powers, it's about one simple thing:\nshould we allow damages actions against an Attorney\nGeneral of the United States and ultimately AUSAs for\ndoing their job, when they're alleged to have a bad\nmotive?\nIf I could start with the Chief Justice's\npoint about the cost of these lawsuits and allowing them\nto proceed. My friend on the other side says, well, but\nthis will be a small, rare case, an isolated example,\nbut I don't think that's true. I think if you allow\ntheir motivation argument to -- to -- to pierce absolute\nimmunity, you will have this in every case or near every\ncase. 95 to 96 percent of Federal cases are resolved by\nplea agreements. So there isn't someone who is actually\ncalled at trial. You could allege it in any of those\ncases.\nAnd particularly when you lace on to that\nwhat my friend has said is a disturbing, quote,\n\"national pattern of abuse\" of the material witness\nstatute, something which we --with which we vigorously\ndisagree, but if you could add the fact that someone\nwasn't called on in a trial to that national pattern,\nthen you'll be having these damages actions quite a bit\nof the time. Now he says don't worry, it will only be a\nfew hundred of these lawsuits. Well, leaving apart the\nfact that that excludes immigration cases and excludes\nthe States' cases, as Justice Kennedy said, a few\nhundred lawsuits just at the Federal level filed against\nthe Attorney General?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Katyal, there are\nsome elements of this picture that are very disturbing,\nand we are talking about the Attorney General and the\nAttorney General's immunity. But there are allegations\nhere that this man was kept awake, the lights shining in\nhis cell for 24 hours, kept without clothes. Now that\ndoesn't sound like the way one would treat someone whose\ntestimony you want. Is there a remedy that he has for\nthat obvious mistreatment?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, with\nrespect to that whole set of questions, conditions of\nconfinement, that isn't before the Court right now.\nWhat is before the Court is -- is exclusively Fourth\nAmendment concerns. Now, Mr. Al-Kidd did sue other\npeople, including the warden who was responsible for\nthat, and I think that there have been other ancillary\nlitigation with -- with respect to that, but to hold\neither the Attorney General or prosecutors liable is\nsomething that would, I think, ultimately open the door\nto, at least there are a few hundred lawsuits at the\nFederal level if not more.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would like to go back to\nthe statute. If an officer fills out an affidavit for a\nsearch and says there were drugs in the house, so I want\nto search it, and it turns out he was lying, you would\nhave a damages action?\nGENERAL KATYAL: The officer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- you have -- you\npotentially have a damages against the officer, not\nagainst the prosecutor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm saying the\nofficer, because he told a lie.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now here it\nsays that the person filling out the affidavit has to\nsay he is a material witness. So suppose that the\nplaintiffs were to prove that the individual who signed\nthat was not telling the truth in saying he is a\nmaterial instant -- witness because not just but for,\nbut there was no possibility he would call this\nindividual, none. And that's what they have to prove.\nIt's really very hard burden of proof.\nNow, one, would that interfere significantly\nwith law enforcement? And, two, how do you distinguish\nit from the drug case?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Breyer, I'm not\nsure if your hypothetical has it as the prosecutor who\nis filing the affidavit and lying or the agent. If it\nis the agent, I don't think that is something as to\nwhich absolute immunity, that's Malley v. Briggs and a\nwhole line of cases. Qualified immunity, of course,\nwould, and indeed those claims are pending in this -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in the case of the\nagent, you're prepared to say that we will allow the\nplaintiff to go into his motive to the extent that the\nplaintiff can show there is no possibility he intended\nto call this individual?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think that at least for\npurposes -- I would say there is at least no absolute\nimmunity prohibition against that. There may be -- may\nbe relevant under other lines of authority.\nBut with respect to my friend's point about\nyour hypothetical in which he said that there -- you\nknow, the government isn't sticking to its position or\nsomething like that, I just want to be clear. Our\nposition is for the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't look to\nsubjective motivations at all. That's Whren and Brigham\nCity and the like, but the statute in 3144 does have\nsafeguards, prophylactic safeguards to guard against the\ntype of abuse that I think several justices have\nmentioned today. So that you could only detain someone\nso long as their release wouldn't result in a failure of\njustice and the like.\nMy friend also said that -- that there's no\nhistorical precedent for this. I would urge the Court\nto look at the 1846 statute, which didn't require\nfailure to comply before a witness was brought in on a\nmaterial witness warrant and it didn't -- and it had\nsureties in it. I don't think what the government is\ndoing here is any different.\nMaybe I'll just make one final point,\npicking up on what Justice Alito said about the\nallegations in this very case, because I don't think if\nyou look at the complaint that the allegations in this\ncase prove either that the Attorney General or the line\nAUSA had a single motive. This is fleshed out at pages\n17 to 19 of our reply brief. At best, they're\nconsistent with their newly minted standard, a dual\nmotive standard.\nAnd given that, I think that the complaint\nwould fall on their own terms, and indeed that law -\nthat line that they're proposing, a but-for causation\nline, would be extremely difficult to apply in practice\nand would ultimately lead to lawsuits filed against\nattorneys general and line prosecutors alike.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
