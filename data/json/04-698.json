        "content": "[11:03 a.m.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nSchaffer against Weast.\nMr. Hurd, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. HURD: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nAs Congress recently reaffirmed, the IDEA was\nenacted to protect the rights of children with\ndisabilities, and the rights of their parents. It is an\nAct intended by Congress to remedy a long history of\ndiscrimination that once kept these children from the\nschoolhouse door. It is an Act intended, as this Court\nsaid in Rowley, to maximize parental involvement and to\nensure that these children have access to an appropriate\neducation.\nToday, the intent of Congress, as shown by the\ntext, structure, and purposes of the Act, calls for the\nburden of proof in administrative hearings to be placed on\nthe school system, not on the parent.\nThe Fourth Circuit said that placing the burden\non the party who initiates proceeding is the traditional\nrule. But, there is no single traditional rule. Instead,\nthere is a collection of different rules.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, Congress was silent on\nthis subject of the burden of proof, was it not?\nMR. HURD: Yes, it was, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there -- did you find\nanything in the legislative history -- I know some members\ndon't care to look at that, but I would be willing --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that shows any discussion\nat all about the burden-of-proof question?\nMR. HURD: We are aware of none, Your Honor.\nWhat we -- what we have here is a situation where\nCongress, when it wishes to allocate the burden of proof\none way or the other legislatively, knows how to do so.\nIt did so in the APA, for example, while adopting the rule\nthat the Fourth Circuit said applies in this case. But\nCongress did not adopt the rule in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why didn't it? I\n-- why wasn't the APA applicable?\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the APA governs\nFederal agencies, it doesn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. HURD: -- govern proceedings --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. HURD: -- under the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So --\nMR. HURD: -- under the IDEA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what it if were -- what it\nwere a school on a Federal base? Are they covered by this\nAct, by the way? You know --\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, there are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- military schools on military\n--\nMR. HURD: -- DOD schools --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: DOD schools. What do you do\nwith them? Are they governed by the APA?\nMR. HURD: We don't believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. HURD: They are not. And part of the reason\nfor that has to do with this unique structure of the Act.\nIt is a very nontraditional statute. It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you'd be suing some\nFederal agency. I mean, it has to be some Federal agency\nthat's running that school, and at least for that kind of\na school the burden is clearly going to be on the person\nchallenging the agency action.\nMR. HURD: I don't agree, Your Honor, and let\nme explain why, because of the unique structure of this\nAct, it creates an equal partnership between parents and\nthe school system, with the purpose of that partnership\nbeing to produce an Individualized Education Program for\nthe benefit of the child. And, as this Court recognized\nin Honig, that IEP is the centerpiece of the entire\nstatute.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, well, what if you had\nan IEP that the parents had initially agreed with, and\nthen they decide it isn't working well, they want to\nchallenge it. They shouldn't have a burden of proof?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, that would be a different\nsituation, and courts below have reached different results\non that. We believe that the school system --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you mean the court has\n-- every court faced with this problem is supposed to\ndecide, in that particular case, who has the\nburden?\nMR. HURD: No, Your Honor. Some courts have\ndecided that, where either party -- the school system or\nthe parents -- challenges an existing IEP or wants to\nchange an existing IEP, some courts have said the burden\nis always on the school system, some have said the party\nchallenging has the burden. But --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you --\nMR. HURD: -- in this case --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do you think it's open to\na State to adopt a general rule on who has the burden of\nproof under this statute?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, we think that it is not.\nWe believe it is a Federal question that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have some States purported to\nadopt a general rule on this?\nMR. HURD: Some have, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you think that's invalid?\nMR. HURD: Well, we believe -- yes, Your Honor,\nwe believe it is a -- it is a Federal-law question. What\nwe do know, however, is that Maryland has adopted no rule\non this question, no statute to allocate the burden, one\nway or the other. And even if a State has the ability to\nadopt a rule, if it wishes to do so, that still leaves\nopen the question of what rules should apply in the\nabsence of a State-based rule. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hurd, do you recognize --\nto narrow what's at issue -- that the parent objecting\nto the school's IEP would at least have a burden of coming\nforward? In other words, I -- are you speaking just of\nthe ultimate persuasion burden? Wouldn't the parents at\nleast be required to come forward with some reason to\nbelieve that the State -- the school district's plan is\ninadequate?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, we don't believe that\nit's necessary. We do recognize that is a different\nquestion. In this case, for example, the school system\nwas required to go first, but, initially, the parents were\ngiven the burden of proof. It is a -- it is a different\nquestion.\nAnd let me address, if I may, the different\nparadigm that this kind of action presents, because it's\nvery different than a traditional statute. It goes back\nto this unique equal partnership. Congress intends for\nthat child to have an IEP. And there are only two ways to\nget that IEP. One is a consensus between parent and\nschool system. But if there is an impasse, Congress still\nwants that child to have an IEP, and there's only one way\nto carry out that congressional purpose; somebody has to\nstep forward and ask for the hearing officer to make a\ndecision. And it makes little sense to burden a party\njust because that party is the one who stepped forward to\nadvance the congressional goal by asking for the IE- --\nhearing officer first.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What case is your closest one\nto support the view that the Court should adopt some\nparticular rule here, based on the scheme?\nMR. HURD: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What do you rely on? I just\ndon't know where we look for the --\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, I would --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- guiding principle.\nMR. HURD: -- I would -- Justice O'Connor, I\nwould point, for example, to your opinion in Gebser vs.\nLago Vista, where you said that the general rule -- this\nwas not a burden-of-proof case, but, in any event, you\nsaid the general rule must yield to the purposes of the\nstatute --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, but let --\nMR. HURD: -- in order to figure out --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- let's talk about--\nMR. HURD: -- congressional intent.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- burden-of-proof cases.\nWhat is your closest one where the courts are left to do\nthis? What do we look to?\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the Court, last\nyear, in Alaska versus EPA, said, there is no single rule,\nor principle, governing the allocation of the burden. And\nin that case, this Court also said two other things that\nare important here. One is, it put the burden on the\nGovernment in that case, regardless of whether the\nGovernment was the plaintiff or the defendant. So, the\nidea of burdening the party who initiates the proceedings\nwas rejected there, and this Court said it looked at the\npurposes of the statute and saw no reason to place the\nburden differently, depending upon whether the Government\ncame to court as the plaintiff or took unilateral action\nforcing the other side to come to court where the\nGovernment would be the defendant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand the purposes-of-\nthe-statute argument. The purpose of the statute is\nalways to provide relief to someone who's been injured.\nAnd to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden\nshould be on the other side, in order -- in order that\npeople who are injured can get relief, is -- I mean --\nMR. HURD: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that will always be the\ncase.\nMR. HURD: Justice Scalia, the purpose of the\nstatute is to obtain for the child an Individualized\nEducation Program.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. I -- that's one\nsort of relief. But, I mean, you have some relief at\nissue under every statute. They want a needy person to be\ngiven justice. And to say that, since that's their\npurpose, you should always put the burden on the other\nside, is -- I just don't understand that argument.\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, this is a unique\nstatutory scheme. The purposes of the Act are set forth\nin the law very clearly -- page 6 and 7 of the addendum to\nthe blue brief -- one is to ensure that all children with\ndisabilities have available to them a free, appropriate\npublic education. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMR. HURD: -- that purpose is served far more,\nJustice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Federal Tort Claims\nAct, for all I know, says, in its prologue -- or, if it\ndoesn't, it should have, or it could have -- the purpose\nof this is to assure that every person who's been injured\nby a -- by a Government tort obtains relief.\nMR. HURD: But let me, then, point out the very\ndifferent paradigm between the ordinary tort claim statute\nand this statute. In your ordinary tort claim statute,\nyour ordinary litigation, the law starts out by being\nneutral with respect to the status quo. And that's the\nreason why you have this rule -- we don't think it is\ncalled \"traditional rule\" appropriately -- but the general\nrule that you place the burden on the party who initiates\nlitigation is because the law is neutral with respect to\nthe status quo at the beginning of the lawsuit. Here, the\nlaw is not neutral, because the status quo before the\nhearing is: the child has no Individualized Education\nProgram.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's where I am not\nunderstanding your argument. There is an IEP in all of\nthese cases. I would understand your argument if the\nState -- the school district said, \"We're not going to\neducate this kid. Throw him into the pot with everybody\nelse. We won't give you an IEP.\" That's not what we've\ngot here. And, in fact, if that's what we had here, the\nburden-of-proof issue would be of no significance, because\nthe State -- the parents would walk in, and the only thing\nthey'd have to do to satisfy \"a\" burden of proof would be\nto say, \"They didn't come up with an IEP.\"\nMR. HURD: Justice Scalia [sic] --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Instead, what we have here is a\nfight about whether it's a good IEP or no IEP.\nMR. HURD: Justice Scalia, with all due respect,\nthere is no IEP; there's only a proposed IEP. And that is\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then --\nMR. HURD: -- the crucial difference --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- then we're arguing about\nwords.\nMR. HURD: The point, though, is that with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The State is not saying, \"We\nwill not come up with an IEP.\" The State is saying, \"This\nis what we're going to give you,\" and the parents say,\n\"It's not good enough.\"\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, that is not an IEP; that\nis a proposed IEP. And it is not merely arguing about\nwords; it goes to the heart of the statute. Let me\nexplain why.\nThree things this Court has said -- or the\nregulations say. Number one, the regulations say that the\nparents and the school system are equal partners. This\nCourt said, in the Honig case, that Congress very much\nintended to strip school systems of the power to act\nunilaterally with respect to these children. Thirdly,\nthis Court said, in Rowley, the purpose of the statute is\nto maximize parental involvement.\nNow, if we're equal partners at the table, what\nsense does it make for the school system to tell the\nparents that, \"We are equal partners here, but, if you\ndisagree with me once we leave the table, I am presumed\ncorrect\"?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What sense does it make for the\nparents to tell that to the school system? I mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In an -- in an equal-\npartnership argument, nobody's got the burden of proof.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, in an equal-partnership\nargument, nobody has the burden, because they initiated\nthe proceeding to ask for the goal that Congress had in\nmind --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In all events --\nMR. HURD: -- that the child have an IEP.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in all events, it seems to\nme that it's still cut against you. This is a statutory\nscheme where, you point out, the parents have access to\nsome initial consultation. In most instances -- or in\nmany instances, people who are suing an institution don't\nhave that initial access. Here, the parents get much more\ninitial information than most -- than most petitioners do\n--\nMR. HURD: They --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- than most -- than most\ncomplainants, than most aggrieved persons do.\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, actually their\ndiscovery rights are less than what they would normally\nhave. But let me go to the idea, then, that we are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then let --\nMR. HURD: -- equal partners --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let me point -- let me\npoint out something else. Let's assume a state of affairs\n-- just assume that school districts -- many of them --\nindependently and, I think, collectively, because school\ndistricts talk to each other -- have a growing body of\ndata and expertise about IEP. And this is the basis on\nwhich you say that they should come forward. It seems to\nme that, too, though, cuts against you, because when a\nschool district has expertise, I think it's entitled to a\npresumption of governmental deregularity. And you have\nto challenge it.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, we disagree with that,\nbecause of the structure of the Act. Again, it makes no\nsense to be equal partners at the table, and, once you\nreach an impasse, to say, well, you're going to presume\none side is right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a well-established\nprinciple of administrative law. I've never seen a case\nin administrative law where a party -- a private party\ncoming in and challenging a Government's action doesn't\nbear the burden of proof. And Alaska isn't contrary to\nthat. Alaska, they were citing hornbook law, whether --\nwhat happens with the -- if EPA normally does have a\nburden of proof when it challenges a State action, and\nthat doesn't change, whether they bring it in a State\nproceeding or whether it's in a Federal proceeding. I\ndidn't think it was quite on point. But maybe you know\nthat I'm wrong on this. And so --\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is there a -- can you think\nof any instance, in all of administrative law, where you\ndidn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a\n-- an agency action that's been taken, and so forth,\ndoesn't have the burden of proof?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, there is no analogous\ncase, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I --\nMR. HURD: -- because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I do think that, yes.\nMR. HURD: -- because there is no analogous\nstatute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There isn't?\nMR. HURD: There's no analogous statute. There\nis no other statute we've been able to find where private\ncitizens are made equal partners with Government in the\ndesign and approval of Government actions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Does this every\ncome up? I mean, the other thing I wondered about this --\nit seems to me you have a hearing examiner and a district\njudge who have actually said what is only a law\nprofessor's dream. They say, \"Oh, the evidence is\nprecisely and equally in balance.\" I didn't know that\nhappened in the real world. I --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I thought that their --\nthat judges normally did their job, which is, you look at\ncomplicated evidence, and you say, \"This side is a little\nbit better, or that side is a little bit better.\" Has\nthis come up in -- a lot, where they say, in this area,\n\"Oh, it's exactly\" --\nMR. HURD: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"in equipoise\"?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't know\nhow many times the hearing officer has said that. I do\nthink the burden of proof is not -- is not -- or the\nevidence is not balanced on a razor's edge. I think it is\na -- is a broader table than that. But let me explain, if\nI may, three reasons.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, before you get\nto your three reasons, to go back to your -- something\nthat you said? I asked you, Are you dividing the burden\nof production and persuasion? And you said no, it's all\non one side or the other. But it seems to me your\ndescription of this proceeding, you said the school\ndistrict goes first. So --\nMR. HURD: In this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the school district did\ncome forward. And is that the usual practice in these\nadministrative hearings -- that the first one to go to\ndefend the plan is the school district, not the parents\nwho are attacking it?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, I believe that the\ntypical procedure would be that the -- whichever party has\nthe burden of proof would go first.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said, in this case --\nMR. HURD: It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the school district went\nfirst.\nMR. HURD: Yes, Your Honor. In this particular\ncase, the hearing officer had not yet resolved the burden-\nof-proof issue at the beginning of the hearing, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, now, as a result of the\nFourth Circuit's decision, do the parents always go first\n--\nMR. HURD: Oh --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and not the school\ndistrict? The school district has a plan that it has put\nforward. And it seemed to me logical, well, it has a\nplan, so it should defend it.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, the typical rule is,\nobviously, that whichever party has the burden of proof in\nthat proceeding would go first, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you think the ALJ -- or\nthe administrative hearing officer in this case told the\nState to go first -- the school district to go first\nbecause he thought that maybe they had burden of proof,\nand would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, there was a -- it's\nunclear why he had them go first. There was some State\nregulation -- then in effect, no longer in effect -- that\nsuggested that perhaps the State had some initial burden\nin that case. We're not necessarily asking that the --\nthat the -- that the State be required to go first. What\nwe are asking is that the State -- excuse me, not the\nState -- the local school system bear the burden of\npersuasion. And there are three --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, but you're saying this --\nthis is an ad hoc thing. There is no general practice\nabout which one goes first.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, the general practice\nwould be that whoever has the burden of proof, the burden\nof persuasion, would also be the one to go first and go\nlast. That's the general practice in procedures. And we\nbelieve it also applies here. But we're not -- what I'm\n-- my point is that we are not wedded -- this Court was to\ndecide that the parents should go first, but the school\nsystem had the burden of persuasion, that would be fine\nwith us. In the cases where the burden of persuasion is\ngoing to be determinative, both sides are going to have\nsubstantial evidence before the hearing officer.\nThe question we think is most important here,\nif I may, is, Which allocation of the burden of proof best\nadvances the purposes of Congress? There are three\nreasons, at least, why we believe putting the burden on\nthe school system best advances purposes of the\nCongress.\nNumber one has to do with the risk of an\nerroneous decision. This Court, for example, in Santosky,\nsaid: What will happen if there is an erroneous decision?\nIt asked that question in the context of the standard of\nproof. It is important to ask that same question here.\nIf the hearing officer makes a mistake and\nawards the child services that are not really needed, then\nthe child will receive a somewhat better education than\nthe law requires, and the school --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's only play money,\nright?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well I think it's only right\n- this isn't the question, Who's going to pay for it?\nBecause this -- doesn't the parent often go ahead and get\nthe other -- the better program, and then they ask for\nreimbursement for the -- from the Government?\nMR. HURD: Well, not in that case, where the --\nmy hypothetical was, where the hearing officer has awarded\nservices --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that many of\nthese fights occur after much of the education has already\ntaken place --\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, because of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and they're fighting about\nwho pays for it?\nMR. HURD: -- the wheels of justice grind slowly\n-- sometimes they do, but they -- the key point here is,\nlook at what happens if the hearing officer denies\nservices the child needs. The child is going to be\nharmed, and, in the long run, society is going to be\nharmed, as this Court recognized in Rowley. The harm to\nthe child if the burden is erroneously -- excuse me -- the\nharm --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's --\nMR. HURD: -- to the child --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's not true if the\nparents can afford to pay for it, and have, in fact, paid\nfor it. Then the child is the neutral factor in it. Of\ncourse, in some cases, what you say would be true, but not\nin --\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, in most cases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not in all cases.\nMR. HURD: -- it would be true. These parents\nwere fortunate -- this child was fortunate, that they were\nable to pay for Brian's services until Montgomery County\nfinally changed its mind and gave him the kind of services\nhe had sought from the beginning, services they gave him\nonce they were given the burden of proof. But most\nparents are not going to be in that situation. Most\nparents of children with disabilities are not going to be\nable to go out and obtain the services they need if the\nhearing officer does not award --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hurd, here's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- here's my problem with your\nassertion that we have to decide it in the way that\nfurthers the purposes of the statute. We said, in other\ncases -- and correctly, I think -- that no statute pursues\nits purpose at all costs, that there are limitations upon\nits purpose. It, of course, wants students who need this\nspecial help to get it, but it also does not want students\nwho don't need this special help to get it. And for you\nto say, \"There's no harm done.\" You know, \"If he -- if\nhe's given it when he doesn't need it. What's the\nproblem? He goes to a better school.\" The problem is\nthat this is not play money. It's coming from somewhere;\nand, namely, on the citizens who have to pay for it.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, my purpose is not to\nminimize the monetary interests involved, but it is to\nfocus the Court's attention on the aspect of it that\nCongress had focused on. Certainly, if we have an\nerroneous decision either way, there will be some loss.\nIf the loss is on the school system, it will not be\nunimportant; it will be some money. If the loss is on the\nchild, it will be in the squandering of human potential --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, that's true. That's\n-- I understand. I sympathize with that point. I'm\nworried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't\njust cover the initial IEP. It covers a whole range of\nthings, including, for example, you have a hyperactive\nchild. The hyperactive child behaves badly in class. The\nhyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how\nit's placed. Well, the parents might -- properly, perhaps\n-- think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might\nchallenge that disciplinary mark. There can be thousands\nof different kinds of issues that come up. And, in all of\nthese issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the\nschool board, for example, to show that the teacher who\nhad the child sit in the back of the class or received a\nbad discipline mark or something? Does the -- does the\nschool board have to prove that the teacher was right?\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, those cases would\nnot arise under the IDEA --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wouldn't it, if it were related\nto the placement?\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, your hypothetical did not\nchange the child's placement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I say that there are a\nnumber of -- what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim\ndecisions that come up that are affecting how the child is\nplaced -- whether in class, whether in that class, whether\nwith a special teacher, whether without a special teacher,\nwhether with somebody during the recess periods, whether\nnot. I mean, they're -- these are very complicated\nmatters, and there can be important overall matters, and\nthere can be what I'd call interstitial matters.\nMR. HURD: Your Honor, the initial matters you\ndiscussed -- sent to the back of the room -- the IDEA is\nnot implicated there. If the school system tries to\nchange the child's placement, then this Court has already\nsaid that the school system bears --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm driving at is -- and I\nthink it was well expressed in one of these cases, a New\nJersey case, perhaps -- that is it the same burden of proof\nwhether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an\ninitial placement or a change of --\nMR. HURD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- placement? Do we have the\nsame burden of proof always on the school board, no matter\nwhat?\nMR. HURD: I understand your question, Your\nHonor. We believe the strongest possible case is,\ninitially, where there is no IEP, where this is equal\npartnership, and the school system should be required to\ncome forward and demonstrate this program is appropriate.\nIf, however, you have a -- an agreed IEP and the\nparents say, \"Well, now we want to change that,\" then the\ncase for the parents is, frankly, not so strong. It is a\ndifferent case. And some courts have said, in those\ncases, the parents have the burden, as the District Court\ndid, actually, in this case, by way of dictum. Other\ncourts have said, no, the school system always have the --\nhas the burden.\nThe Court need not go so far here as the New\nJersey court went in Lascari, and say the school system\nalways has the burden in order to the rule -- rule for the\nparents in this case and say that, initially, when there\nis no IEP, only a proposed IEP -- and, Justice Souter,\nBurlington used that word three times, \"IEP proposal,\"\nwhich we think implies that it was not a real IEP -- this\n-- the Court need not decide the other issue in order to\ndecide that when there is no IEP, only a proposal, and\nwhen you have equal parties before the hearing officer,\nthat it makes no sense to allocate the burden on which one\nfiled for the hearing officer first, who asked for the\ntiebreaker first. That really makes no sense.\nYou have to, instead, we submit, decide the\ncase based on which allocation of the burden in this\nsituation is most in accord with the purposes of the\nstatute. Two purposes, if I may. Protecting the rights\nof children with disabilities, and the rights of their\nparents, is what the statute says.\nProtect them from whom? What did Congress have\nin mind? Obviously, to protect them, quite frankly, from\nthe school systems, who had this history of\ndiscrimination, who are more powerful, if you will, in\nterms of both information and resources, and who have a\nfinancial incentive, as the Deal court recognized, to\nminimize the needs of the child. Protecting the side that\nCongress meant to protect means putting the burden on the\nother side: the school system.\nSecondly, more fundamentally, the purpose is to\nensure the children have an appropriate education. The\nlaw doesn't say \"promote.\" It doesn't say \"presume.\" It\ndoesn't say \"risk.\" It says \"ensure.\"\nIn baseball, there's an old umpires' rule that\nthe tie goes to the runner. In order to carry out\npurposes of this statute, when the evidence is in\nequipoise, the tie should go to the child.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nPetitioners rejected the educational plan found\nappropriate by local school officials, enrolled their\nchild in an expensive private school, and then filed a\ndue-process complaint seeking reimbursement of $21,000 in\nprivate tuition expenses. The Court of Appeals properly\nheld that petitioners bore the burden of proof in that\nproceeding, just like --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: This is a case where the\nparents unilaterally decided to move the child to a\nprivate school, and then they sought tuition\nreimbursement?\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: -- O'Connor. Petitioners bore the\nburden of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't contend the rule\nwould be different if we were -- if it was all\nprospective, do you?\nMR. GARRE: No. Your Honor, we think the rule\nis the same in all of the various situations that could\narise under the statute -- the complaining party, whether\nit's the parents, as in this case, or the school district,\nas in many other instances. And, Justice Breyer, you're\nright, one of the situations that is covered by this\nstatute is where a child with a disability acts out in\nclass, and the school has to take disciplinary action\nagainst that child. In that situation, IDEA regulates the\nactions that the school district can take. And if the\nparents believe that the school district has -- take a\nmore severe disciplinary action than is required by the\nstatute, school -- the school district, or the parents,\ncould initiate a challenge in that situation.\nIn fact, there are many parts of the statute\nthat we think speak to the question, or at least --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we -- you go onto the\nargument, your answer to Justice O'Connor, if I remember\nthe facts correctly, wasn't quite right. This child was\nin private school for years, and the parents weren't\nasking anybody to do anything, because -- and it's only\nwhen the private school said, \"We have to -- we can no\nlonger put up with your child. Your child has all these\nproblems\" -- at that time, the parents then came to the\nschool district and asked for an IEP.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.\nThe child was in a private school, at which point in time,\nthe private school suggested that they find -- the parents\nfind another environment for the child suitable for what\nthey determined to be \"special needs.\" The parents\ncontacted the local school district, and, at that point,\nthe school district, in conjunction with the parents,\ndevised an educational plan for the child.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which the parents didn't\nthink was acceptable and, in the interim, placed the child\nin another private school. But it was not a case that\nthey put the child in a private school first, and then\nsought reimbursement.\nMR. GARRE: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,\nexcept that the record does show that, during the time\nthat the IEP was being developed, the parents applied for\nthe child to attend a private school and actually accepted\nan application fee and enrolled the child in that school,\nand the ALJ in this case found that the parents had made a\npredetermined decision to send the student to child -- the\nstudent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought --\nMR. GARRE: -- to private school. But we don't\nthink that the facts of this case bear on the question of\nwho bears the burden of proof in the run of the Mine case.\nIt's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Garre, you -- or, Mr.\nGarre, you said, in your earlier statement, that sometimes\nthe school district will be the complaining party. How\ndoes that -- how does that come up?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, there are three\nsituations in which the school district can be the\ncomplaining party. First, where a parent refuses to\nsubject his child to evaluation for special services under\nthe Act, and the school district disagrees and initiates\nthat action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why would the school\ndistrict have to take any action? Why wouldn't it just --\nMR. GARRE: Well, under the statute Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- just say, \"The child can't\ncome to class. He's too disruptive,\" period?\nMR. GARRE: The Congress placed on school\ndistricts the obligation to identify disabled children\nwithin their jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. GARRE: And when they have -- they believe\nthey identified such children, and they request the\nparents to subject them to the evaluation -- Congress\nplaced on the school districts to at least conduct an\nevaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. GARRE: -- school districts can initiate.\nThe second situation is in -- is where children\nact up in the classroom. The school -- the statute places\nrestrictions on how the school district can discipline a\nchild if the school district determines that the\nmisbehavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.\nIn that situation, if the -- if the school district\nbelieves that more severe discipline is warranted than\nwould be allowed under the statute, the school district\nhas to initiate the hearing in order to get an ALJ to\nallow it to take more severe action.\nAnd the third situation is where the school\ndistrict disagrees with a parent's request for an\nindependent educational evaluation. Parents can request,\nas part of the developmental process of an educational\nplan, to have an independent educational evaluation\nconducted on their child, paid for at public expense.\nMost of the times, that's conducted without incidence. In\nsome situations, if school districts believe that that\nexpense was not warranted, they could initiate a\nproceeding.\nAnd in all those cases, we acknowledge that --\nunder the traditional rule, that the complaining party,\nthe party that initiates the action and seeks relief,\nbears the burden of proof in that proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, do you have any\nnumbers, overall, how -- of the incidence of the parents\ngoing to the administrative hearing first, as opposed to\nthe school district? Isn't it overwhelming that, in these\nproceedings, the parents are the one -- ones who initiate\nthe hearing?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't have those\nstatistics. I would -- I think it's probably true that in\nmost instances it's the parents who are initiating the\nhearing. That would not have been news to Congress,\nhowever. Congress, in the statute -- and this is one of\nthe things that we think is important, bearing on the\nburden of proof -- placed on parents the obligation to\nplead their case -- that is, to identify both the problem\nwith the educational plan that they've seen -- and this is\nin 20 U.S.C. 1450(b)(7) -- as well as the proposed\nsolution that they would -- that they would like to see\nthe Court adopt. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now we go back to the --\nan answer you gave before, when we were going through\nwhat, in fact, happened, the suggestion that maybe the\nparents were just trying to get the private-school tuition\nreimbursed, the -- there was a finding, wasn't there, in\nthe District Court, in the -- this is in the Petitioner's\nappendix, at 46 and 47 -- the district court said, \"The\nparents in no way prevented the IEP from being formulated\nor otherwise failed, in good faith, to consider it.\"\nMR. GARRE: The -- Your Honor, that's correct.\nI think that the District Court also acknowledged, though,\nthat the parents probably were interested in sending their\nchild to private school. I think, either way, we're not\nsuggesting that the record in this case requires the Court\nto take one result or another on the fundamental question\nof who bears the burden of proof. We think that the\ncomplaining party bears the burden of proof. That's the\nrule --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if I take -- if I accept\nyour view of that, that would be a Federal rule written\ninto the statute. And that would mean that, even if the\nDepartment of Education came to a different conclusion, or\neven if we have a bunch of States that come to a different\nconclusion, or even if it's in Minnesota, they want to\nhave a rule that \"sometimes it's one way, sometimes the\nother way,\" we couldn't do that. But if I were a Member\nof Congress, and never thought about the issue, which I\nthink this void in the statute suggests, I might think it\nwould work out better if we left it up to each State to do\nit whatever way they wanted here, if we left it up to the\nDepartment of Education to promulgate whatever rules they\nwanted. Now, couldn't we hold that?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact,\nwe've suggested that. In fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you haven't suggested\nleaving it up to each State, because you're suggesting a\nuniform rule. So, what -- how would you have it?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, to be clear, we\nthink that this -- that the statute establishes a Federal\nfloor. It is spending clause -- a federal floor -- it is\n-- or a default rule that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it's just --\nMR. GARRE: -- unless --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- a default rule.\nMR. GARRE: Exactly. That the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's just a\ndefault rule, that's a big improvement, because any State\ncan do it any way it wants.\nMR. GARRE: And that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then, why not, here, send\nit back and say that the ALJ tried to answer the wrong\nquestion? He tried to answer the question of what was the\nFederal law, but what he really should have done was ask\nabout what's the State law. And if he has a hard time\nfiguring it out, perhaps he should look at that evidence\nharder and see. Maybe --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is there any doubt,\nhere, that there's no State law?\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, and I believe you\njust heard Mr. Hurd acknowledge that there is no statute\nor regulation on this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but I've never heard of a\nState without law. There is no --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- black hole in the law --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the burden of proof in IEP\ncases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I should have explained.\nMR. GARRE: And, Your Honor, the Maryland case\nlaw adopts a traditional rule for administrative\nproceedings. We cite the case, in page 18 of the red\nbrief. Importantly, though, what petitioners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These cases are appealed to\nFederal courts normally, aren't they?\nMR. GARRE: These cases -- the Congress gave\nthem the right to bring a civil action in Federal court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Federal courts. And most of\nthese cases are in Federal courts. And you're -- you want\nto condemn Federal courts to figuring out what the State\nburden of proof is?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think -- we\nanalogize it to the question of the substantive amount of\nbenefits to which parents are entitled under the Act. We\nthink that this spending-clause legislation would allow a\nState to adopt a higher standard than the standard that\nthis Court established in Rowley for free and\nappropriate public education, and that that would be the\nstandard that would apply in a proceeding. And so, too,\nwe think, with the question of the burden of proof. If\nStates wanted to voluntarily assume the burden of proof\nfor their own school districts in these proceedings, which\nthis Court has characterized as a substantive rule of law\n-- the question of who bears the burden of proof -- we\nthink that States could do so, and that that would be the\nrule that applies. We don't quarrel with that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not hypothetical. Isn't\nit -- it isn't hypothetical. States -- isn't it true that\nsome States have said that, in these hearings, the school\ndistrict will have the burden of proof?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor. We believe -- I\nbelieve eight States have said that. Three States -- at\nleast three States have said that the burden of proof is\non the parents in these proceedings. Some States have\ntaken different views and said if -- I believe it's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --\nMR. GARRE: -- Minnesota has said that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the -- to the extent\nthat we're concerned about unnecessarily increasing costs\non school districts, and burdens on school districts, why\nshouldn't we have a uniform Federal rule? In other words,\nif we agree with your position that ordinary allocations\nputs this on the complainant, we have to conserve\nresources, and so forth, why should we allow States to\nhave a different rule, when we're dealing with the\nadministration of a Federal program?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, because of the\nspending-clause nature of the legislation. That's what we\nthink, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, would you --\nMR. GARRE: -- this establishes a Federal floor\nthat States can go beyond if they want to assume more\ncosts under the Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have a statute that\n-- you know, it's in -- it's in great detail -- on\nadministrative procedures. It obviously -- you know,\ndecision of hearing officer, administrative procedures,\ndisclosure, evaluations, and recommendations. And you\nthink the Federal Government goes into all this detail and\ndoesn't care who has the burden of proof? That seems, to\nme, most unlikely.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice Scalia, we agree, in\nthe sense that we think that the statute establishes at\nleast a default rule. And, just to be clear, if the Court\nholds that Federal law establishes the traditional rule,\nthen, obviously, we would be very happy with that\ndecision. What we -- what we reject to strenuously is\npetitioner's position that Federal law imposes an unstated\nburden on the school districts in all proceedings\ninitiated under the Act.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. GARRE: That would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- ask this question? You've\ndescribed three situations in which you have the burden of\nat least proceeding, and I guess persuasion, too -- and,\nof course, there's a difference between the two. And I\nwas just trying to think, if I were a hearing officer, and\nI thought, well, the issue in this case is whether the\nparents' objections to the IEP are valid, I think the\nfirst thing I'd want to know is, What is the IEP, and\nwho's the best person to tell me about it? And wouldn't\nthe county be in the best position to explain what has\nbeen done and, sort of, get the -- get the hearing\nstarted, and so forth?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice Stevens, Congress has\nanswered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in\nresponse to a complaint, the school district to submit the\nproposed -- the IEP, the educational plan, it's adopted,\nas well as the other considerations -- the other options\nit considered and why it didn't accept those other\noptions. So, that evidence -- and I think we're talking\nabout the burden of production --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I --\nMR. GARRE: -- not the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- understand.\nMR. GARRE: -- burden persuasion there -- that\nevidence already is required to be exchanged and\ndisclosed. Here --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then, at the hearing, who\n-- who introduces the first exhibit or the first witness?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the way it's done in the\nStates right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where\nschool districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are\nrequired to go first. And that increases the costs and\ncomplexity of these trials for school districts, because\nthe -- before the parents have put on their evidence as to\nwhy they think an educational plan is inappropriate or is\n-- in this case, why they think the school district hasn't\nproperly characterized their child's disability, the\nschool district has to go forward and present its case,\nwhich is a more complex -- it's -- there's more guesswork\ninvolved --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this? Are there\nany jurisdictions in which the burden of proceeding is\ndifferent from the burden of persuasion?\nMR. GARRE: I don't know the answer to that\nquestion, Justice Stevens. I think it would be a very\nunusual rule.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know, analytically, it's a\ndifferent issue. But it would seem to me the normal rule\nwould be whoever goes first has the burden of the\npersuasion.\nMR. GARRE: That's absolutely correct, and\nthat's certainly the way that we think it would -- it\nwould, more preferably, operate under the statute. But\nthe question before the Court in this case is, Who bears\nthe burden of persuasion? That's a very important\nquestion under the Act. It's not just, with respect, an\nacademic question about the number of cases in with -- in\nwhich the evidence is mathematically in equipoise. It is\ngoing not have a much broader impact on the implementation\nof this statute, because it's going to be decisive, or at\nleast potentially decisive, in cases like this, where\nyou've got a battle of the experts. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why should it be? I\nmean, that's very interesting to me. Why shouldn't the\nlaw be such that particularly -- you have evidence on both\nsides and a neutral decision-maker who sits there -- that\nit encourages that decision-maker to decide. It's one\nthing if the record's blank. But not where they have a\nlot of experts. Decide. Don't retreat to something like\nannouncing, \"Oh, it's in equipoise.\"\nMR. GARRE: The -- we would agree with you,\nJustice Breyer, but, in practice, many of these cases, the\ndispute is over the provision of experimental therapies\nfor children with disabilities, particularly children with\nautism, where medically and educationally --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but then to do that\nis not really to look to the interests of the child or the\nboard. I mean, it is to allow a sort of doctrine from\nleft field, nothing to do with the merits, to decide the\ncase.\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. We think that what\nit is to do is to give effect to the traditional\npresumption of regularity, which is, ultimately -- if you\ndo have a tie, whose judgment ought to be given effect?\nAnd under the statute, where Congress recognized that\nState and local governments would retain the primary\nauthority over educational decisions -- and in the Rowley\ncase, where this Court reaffirmed that -- we think that,\ncombined with the traditional presumption of regularity --\nwhich is that the actions and decisions of public\nofficials are presumed to be taken in good faith, and\npresumed to be correct -- those factors counsel strongly\nin favor of the traditional rule here. Petitioners --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, if you -- if you\nhad a situation, say, under Title 7 -- and you pointed out\nin your brief that, in most benefit cases, most -- the\nperson -- whether it's Social Security -- the person who\nis making the claim has the burden of proof. But there is\nsomething different about this setup, because the statute\ndoes obligate the school district to come up with a plan.\nAnd so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and\nthe plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a\nquestion of remedy, and the employer said, \"I propose this\n-- these changes to remedy the violation,\" wouldn't the\nemployer in that case have the burden of establishing the\nadequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy\nthe problem?\nMR. GARRE: I think if you're talking about an\naffirmative defense or something beyond the threshold\nquestion of whether there has been discrimination, or as\nin a Social Security Act case question of whether an\neligible person has been denied the benefits --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, you made --\nMR. GARRE: -- to which he's entitled --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that determination has\nbeen made --\nMR. GARRE: I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that the -- that there has\nbeen a violation. And then the question is, What remedy?\nAnd the employer proposes a remedy. Wouldn't the\nemployer have the burden of showing the adequacy of the\nremedy that the employer --\nMR. GARRE: I think the plaintiff would still\nbear the burden of showing that he is -- he or she has\nbeen discriminated against --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's no violation\nhere. I mean, this is a totally different --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- situation. I mean --\nMR. GARRE: And that's my threshold --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- there hasn't been finding\nof any violation by the school district. The school\ndistrict --\nMR. GARRE: That's my threshold point --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- but I'm interested in\n--\nMR. GARRE: -- that that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I'm interested in Justice\nGinsburg's question. Let's assume you show a violation.\nIs there -- is there any law on who has the burden of\nshowing that the remedy is sufficient?\nMR. GARRE: I think when we talk about the\nburden of proof, we're talking about the essential\nelements of the claim, whether there's been a violation.\nSo I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But when I ask --\nMR. GARRE: -- so I think we're asking --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're asking about the --\nMR. GARRE: -- a different question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- about the -- wait a minute.\nLet's say that the -- we find that there's a violation.\nMR. GARRE: I don't -- in that situation, there\nmay be -- I mean, in the same way that, in the sentencing,\nin the criminal context, other considerations come into\nplay, it doesn't resolve it here.\nPlacing the burden of proof on school\ndistricts in these proceedings would erode the trust and\nconfidence that Congress placed in the judgments of State\nand local educational officials. It would create a\ndemoralizing and destabilizing educational regime in which\nthe judgments --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the background --\nMR. GARRE: -- of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the Act is, Congress was\nvery dissatisfied with most of the judgments being made by\nlocal officials --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this whole area.\nMR. GARRE: But, Your Honor, Congress found that\nState and local governments would retain the primary\nresponsibility for making educational --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say this is --\nMR. GARRE: -- decisions under the Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- okay. You say all these\nhorrible consequences are perfectly okay, so long as the\nStates do it.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if the consequences are\nthat horrible, how can you allow the States to put the\nburden on the other side?\nMR. GARRE: Our position is that -- is that the\nFederal law creates a floor, Justice Scalia, that Congress\nestablished the rules --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I understand that.\nMR. GARRE: -- that it thought was appropriate,\nand then States --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your -- your parade of\nhorribles just never --\nMR. GARRE: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- never gets started, once\nyou -- once you acknowledge that the States can blow the\nwhistle to start the parade.\nMR. GARRE: In that situation, though, States\nare voluntarily assuming the burden on their own school\ndistricts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any --\nMR. GARRE: Here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now we have a number of\nStates that do put the burden on the school district. Is\nthere any indication that the cost is higher in those\nStates than in States that put the burden on the parents?\nMR. GARRE: I think that the cost of the\nhearings -- there are not statistics on that, precisely,\nbut the cost of hearings are going to be greater, because\nschool districts --\nThank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nSeveral features of the IDEA confirm that\nCongress intended the traditional allocation of the burden\nof proof to apply to the administrative hearings under the\nAct, and the most important of these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Absent different disposition\nby the States? What's the Government's position? Can the\nStates change this burden, just the background, you know\n-- unless you -- unless you think it's okay to, you know\n--\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the heavens fall -- we\ndon't want the heavens to fall.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the Government has\nalways understood -- and this Court has understood -- that\nthis is spending-clause legislation, and that the\nrequirements of the Act establish a floor, and that that's\ntrue with regard with the substantive provisions of the\nAct, as well as the procedural ones. And let me give you\none example. I will concede that this may seem somewhat\nanomalous, but this an unusual statute. In Rowley, for\nexample, this Court construed the meaning of the term \"a\nfree, appropriate public education,\" and it determined --\nin fact, it rejected a construction of that term that\nwould have required maximizing the educational benefit to\nthe child.\nThere are States that have adopted that high\nsubstantive requirement for their schools. And when\nsomeone brings an action, either at a due-process hearing\nor in Federal or State court, a separate civil action\nunder statute, the courts apply that higher State\nstandard. We think the same would be true with regard to\na State's decision to adopt more restrictive -- or more\nprotective, excuse me, procedural provisions for the\nparents with children with disabilities. It is left up to\nthe States. The Federal law --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: In other words --\nMR. SALMONS: -- just establishes a floor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- your answer is yes, the\nStates may adopt a burden-of-proof -- here -- standard?\nMR. SALMONS: States may, and States have. What\nwe think is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you have --\nMR. SALMONS: -- improper --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- do you have any\ninformation in -- to the question I asked earlier -- in\nthe States that have said, \"School district, you bear the\nburden,\" do we know whether there's more litigation? Do\nwe know whether there has been a notable increase in the\ncosts in those States that have placed the burden on the\nschool districts?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would say that we\ndon't have any evidence that is as strong as we would like\non that. What we do have, and what I would refer the\nCourt to, is the 2003 GAO report on the way in which the\n-- these provisions have been implemented. That is --\nit's cited in both respondent's and petitioner's brief,\nand it was relied on by Congress in the 2004 amendments.\nAnd what it -- what it demonstrates is that 80 percent --\nnearly 80 percent of all due-process hearings nationwide\nhave occurred in just six jurisdictions, five States and\nthe District of Columbia, and that -- and that, in those\nStates -- it happens to be the case at all, but Maryland,\nwhich is one of those states -- have clear rules that put\nthe burden of proof on the school districts, and that the\ncosts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This --\nMR. SALMONS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These other cases that you\nrefer to, where -- that involve spending legislation,\nwhere the States go beyond what is minimally required -- I\nsuspect that they are cases where it really is an\nimposition on the States, and they accept it. Here, the\nimposition is not on the States, it's on the local school\ndistricts. And very often, the interests of the local\nschool district is quite different from the interests of\nthe people, you know, down-State, in the State capital.\nI'm -- I am loath to think that just because a State\nsupreme court says that every school district in the State\nhas to bear the burden of proof, that Congress intended\nthat to be the case. I think it's a different -- a\ndifferent situation, where the spending is money that's\ncoming out of the -- ultimately, out of the pocket of the\nschool district.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, it may very well be\nthat you would want something more than just a court\ndecision. And I --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we have to --\nMR. SALMONS: -- and the States that have done\nit --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- decide that here?\nMR. SALMONS: No, I don't think --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Maryland --\nMR. SALMONS: -- we do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- doesn't have --\nMR. SALMONS: Maryland --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- such a rule.\nMR. SALMONS: -- Maryland does not. And I\nthink, in fact, the only thing -- the only question that's\ntruly presented in this case is whether the Federal\nstatute mandates the unusual burden -- shift of placing\nthe burden on the schools in all cases. And we think that\nclearly wasn't what Congress intended.\nAnd let me point to the provision of the\nstatute we think is the most relevant, and that is the\nrequirement that the parents -- or the complaining party\nfile a complaint to initiate the due-process hearing. And\nthat traditional pleading regime requires that the -- in\nthis context, the parents come forward and identify, with\nspecificity and with supporting facts, the problem with\nthe school's educational program and how they would\npropose to solve that problem.\nAnd, in 2004, Congress went even further and\nmandated that parents cannot even obtain a due-process\nhearing until they've first complied with this due-process\nnotice requirement, and that the contents of the parents'\ncomplaint will strictly define the subjects that can be\naddressed at the hearing. And we think that is strong\nevidence that Congress intended the traditional allocation\nof the burden of proof.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And may I be sure I didn't\nmisunderstand something you said earlier? Did you say\nthat in most jurisdictions the -- by local option, the\nStates have elected to adopt your adversary's --\nMR. SALMONS: No --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- position?\nMR. SALMONS: -- no, Your Honor, I did not.\nWhat I indicated is that one of the unusual aspects of\nthese due-process hearings is that they occur very\ninfrequently, only about 5 for every 10,000 children\nreceiving educational benefits under the Act nationwide.\nIn certain jurisdictions, there is a very high incidence\nof these hearings. And Congress, in 2004, was clearly\nconcerned about the costs that those hearings were\nimposing, and were diverting funds away from the real\npurposes of the Act.\nNow, getting back to the statute, we think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure you answered my\nquestion. Did you not tell us that in the States where\nthere -- the largest volume of these hearings -- in most\nof those States the burden is on the school board?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. What\nI was saying is that I can't tell you that more States\nthan not have adopted one rule --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I --\nMR. SALMONS: -- or the other.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Not the number of States.\nMR. SALMONS: But most --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Number of hearings.\nMR. SALMONS: -- of the due-process hearings\nthat occur in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: -- in the country --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: -- occur in jurisdictions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think --\nMR. SALMONS: -- where, either by court or by\nrule the burden has been placed --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And this was -- I wanted to\npoint -- was that mostly -- in those jurisdictions, was it\nby court or by rule?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I don't have that\ninformation. Most, I think, of the jurisdictions were --\nmost of the jurisdictions have the burden on the schools,\nbecause that's what the courts -- the Federal courts have\nconstrued the Federal statute to require. What -- the\nreason I have a difficult time answering that is because\nthe amount of due process hearings varies so widely from\none jurisdiction to another.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. SALMONS: And part of that is because of the\nrules and the ways in which it's been adopted.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: See, this is really a unique\nstatute in so many ways. We've learned, over the years,\nthat discrimination is being treated like everybody else\nin this -- in this statute, unusual discrimination. And\nI'm just wondering, it's -- I find it surprising and\nsignificant that those who have been free to pick the\nright rule have picked the rule your opponent --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, no -- Your Honor, there are\nseveral States that have clearly placed the rule -- by\nrule, on the -- on the -- on the person initiating --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. SALMONS: -- the hearing. And, in fact, I\nwould say most States probably have a sort of State APA --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the States that have --\nMR. SALMONS: -- very similar to the Federal\nAPA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the States where most of\nthe hearings have taken place and have taken the opposite\nview, has --\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that been true for a number\n--\nMR. SALMONS: It --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- of years?\nMR. SALMONS: There may be a cause-and-effect\nissue there, Your Honor. It may be the case that the\ntypes -- that by encouraging the type of litigation under\nthe Act by switching the burden of proof has resulted in\nmore cases being brought. The interesting fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see what you mean.\nMR. SALMONS: -- from the 2004 amendments is\nthat Congress sought to reduce the amount of litigation\nunder the Act by, for example, allowing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those States --\nMR. SALMONS: -- for the first time --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Apparently that's -- this has\nbeen -- this is not really a brand-new statute. We're\ngoing back to the '70s --\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- with this statute. And is\nit true that for most of that period that's been the rule,\nwhere most of litigation has taken place --\nMR. SALMONS: I -- Your Honor, I believe it's\nthe -- I can't answer that. I think it's -- it's most --\nit's more recent than that. And I think the explosion of\nlitigation under the Act is more recent than that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. SALMONS: And Congress has been very\nconcerned about that.\nNow, by requiring that the parent's due-process\ncomplaint define the contours of the hearing, we think\nCongress has signaled where the burden of proof should be.\nAnd, in addition to that, it seems -- it seems to us that\nit has addressed the policy and fairness concerns the\npetitioners rely on so much. As this Court recognized in\nRowley, it's through the procedural protections of the Act\nthat Congress sought to ensure that parents had sufficient\ninformation and resources to defend the interests of their\nchild. And we think, by place -- this complaint notice\nrequirement represents a considered judgment by Congress\nthat those procedural protections will have done their\njobs and that parents will be in a strong enough position\nto adequately defend the interests of their child in any\nhearing. And that's certainly true if you would compare\nthe position of the parents under this Act with benefits\nclaimants and civil rights plaintiffs in any number of\nother Federal statutes.\nIf Your Honors have no more questions, thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hurd, you have about three\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. HURD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nLet me begin by focusing on the costs of placing\nthe burden on the school system. Five years ago, the\nUnited States said, when it was then, in this case, on the\nside of the parents, that placing the burden on the school\ndistrict, quote, \"should not substantially increase the\nworkload for the school,\" end quote, page 12 of its brief\nin 2000.\nThe National School Board Association figures\nshow that the total costs of mediation, due-process\nhearings and litigation works out to about $22 per head\nfor every child in special education. That's not a lot of\nmoney to devote to the enforcement of civil rights law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For each hearing or -- for each\nhearing or just --\nMR. HURD: Total, Your Honor. The total figure,\nnationwide, is 146.5 million. If you divide that number\nby the 6.7 children in special ed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. HURD: -- it's about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. HURD: -- $22 a head. And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it would be more\nrealistic to divide it by the number of hearings, rather\nthan by the number of heads.\nMR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the total -- the\ntotal figure is 146.5 million. It is a drop in the bucket\ncompared to the 11.4 billion that Congress appropriates.\nMoreover, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know what the --\nMR. HURD: -- there's no indication --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you know what the figure\nis per hearing?\nMR. HURD: Per hearing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. HURD: -- Your Honor, is going to vary.\nBut there's no indication --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no. You divide the\nnumber of hearings by the figure you've just mentioned,\nand that's the result. Have you -- have you done --\nMR. HURD: There are about 3,000 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the arithmetic?\nMR. HURD: -- there are about 3,000 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Three- --\nMR. HURD: -- hearings, but that $146 million is\nnot just the hearings; it also includes mediation, it\nincludes litigation. And there's no basis to conclude\nthat putting the burden on the parents is going to\ndecrease, rather than increase, hearings. If you let the\nschool systems slide by without being held accountable,\nthey are likely to be less thorough in preparing their\nIEPs, as they were in this case. And when they're less\nthorough, there will be more understatement, more\ndisputes, and less consensus.\nMay I also point out, in response to Justice\nBreyer's point, if there is to be no Federal law on this\nquestion, if it is purely State law -- then it ought to be\nremanded back to the Maryland district court to ascertain\nwhat Maryland law is on this point.\nAnd, Justice O'Connor, while there is no\nstatute or regulation on point, there are certainly\nbackground principles of law that Maryland has, just as\nwe've been arguing here at the Federal level, that would\ndictate for Maryland where that burden of proof should\nlie.\nNow, opposing counsel, the Government, has\npointed out that there are these pleading requirements.\nBut these are not traditional pleading requirements, where\none side makes allegations and the other side goes,\n\"admit, admit, deny, deny.\" If you look on page 12 of the\naddendum, you see the portion of the statute that requires\nthe kind of response the Government must make. It's not\nadmit/deny. It is to give, essentially, a detailed\nexplanation for its position, just as the parents have\ngiven a detailed explanation for their position. And,\nbetween those two positions, you can tell who should have\nthe burden of proof.\nI see my time is up.\nThank the Court.\n[Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
