        "content": "(11:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 06-939, Chamber of Commerce versus Brown.\nMr. Goldsmith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn AB 1889, California defunded employer\nspeech about union organizing because the State's labor\npolicy is that such speech interferes with employee free\nchoice. The Federal policy is that employer speech\nenhances employee free choice. California's labor\npolicy is designed to discourage exactly what the NLRA\npromotes. The fact that California implemented its\nlabor policy as an exercise of its spending authority is\nirrelevant under Gould. If the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say the labor\npolicy promotes it? It certainly permits it, but\nwhat -- what --\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat if you look at the exceptions to the policy, in\nparticular those that allow State funds to be spent for\nthings that clearly facilitate union organizing, for\nexample, that it's not prohibited under AB --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about the\n-- the Federal policy. You say the Federal policy\npromotes this employer speech. Why do you say it\npromotes it? It clearly permits it. It clearly does\nnot discourage it, but is that the same as promoting it?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: I think -- I think it is,\nYour Honor. I think that the cases of this Court and\nthe cases of the NLRB have made clear that free, open,\nrobust debate is important on all matters having to do\nwith the union/employer relationship. That was\ncertainly what the Court noted in Linn.\nThe fact that employer speech is, I think,\nabsolutely critical to an employee being well-enough\ninformed to make an informed judgment about whether to\nsay yes or no to a union, further underscores the point.\nA union election or any situation involving\na contest of any sort between a union and an employer is\nsomething on which both parties should have the right to\nspeak, and to speak in a noncoercive way, and I think\nthat clearly the National Labor Relations Act promotes\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did Congress in\nseveral statutes have a provision from which California\ncopied when it enacted this measure? In several\nstatutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will\ngo to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use\nany money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Your Honor, those are three\nstatutes that the court below and Respondents rely on\nheavily. Those statutes, first of all, I don't think in\nany way reflect the meaning or the sense of Congress\nthat employer speech is to be inhibited in connection\nwith union organizing. Those in no way, I think,\nreflect the overall intent of Congress. More ever,\nnothing in those statutes, in any way, undercuts the\nbasic principles of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they run against that\nprinciple because they say at least under these programs\n-- I think there were more than three. Wasn't Medicare\n--\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Medicare was the fourth, I\nbelieve. It was a regulation not a statute. But\ncertainly in doing that, Congress didn't in any way\nmodify the NLRA. There's nothing in the legislative\nhistory of those statutes that suggests that this\nCourt's principles, as laid down in Machinists and\nGarmon, were in any way to be inhibited. And, moreover,\nwhat Congress can do certainly doesn't mean that the\nStates have the same right. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Those -- those grantees\nwould be subject to the NLRA. So, as to them, it is\nmodified.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, it's not modified in\nthe same way that AB 1889 modifies it, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, under those statutes there is no\nrequirement that funds be segregated. There is no\npossibility of litigation, treble damages to follow.\nThere is no possibility of attorneys' fees to the\nprevailing party. So those statutes are, I think, are\nreally unique and don't in any way change the basic\nprinciple that I think all labor lawyers would agree,\nand that is that, under the National Labor Relations\nAct, all parties to a union election or any issue\nbetween a union and an employer have the right to speak\nin a noncoercive way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Say: Speak, go ahead,\nspeak, speak. Just not on our nickel.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, I think that's clearly\nwhat they say, but it's not that simple given the way\nthis statute operates, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they also say -- by the\nway, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind -- you\nmay be right about it being too much of an\nadministrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but\nthey've made major concessions here, and they say that's\na matter to be worked out on remand. And it may be that\nthey have to be very careful about inhibiting your\nspeech.\nSo let's go back over those administrative\nprovisions one by one. They are suggesting to us, as I\nread it, don't do that now.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: If I may respond to both\nquestions, Your Honor. First of all the notion that one\ncan use your own money, to use the vernacular, and use\nit to speak, doesn't answer the most basic question that\nthe statute presents, and that is that whether you can\nor you can't -- and I'll get to that in a moment -- the\nfact is that California has regulated, used its spending\npower to make labor policy, something that this Court\nhas made clear, in Gould and various other cases, it\ncannot do. But even getting past that, which I think is\nthe end of the case, there are certain employers,\ncertain Petitioners here who are a hundred percent\nfunded by the State. They have no ability, as a result\n-- when I say \"funded by the State\" I mean they depend\nfor their income on State programs, let's say -- they\nhave no ability, none, to speak to employees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. GOLDSMITH: The State has effectively --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the\nState's fault.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, the State's argument\nto that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's a free-market\nchoice. They can either do business in California or\nnot. And I would refer the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they can do\nbusiness with other entities beside the State.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: They can, Your Honor, that's\ntrue, but that doesn't answer the question because for\nthose that -- because of the service that they provide,\nsuch as under Medi-Cal, they have chosen to be in\nbusiness with the State. They are being forced to make\nan election between doing business with the State or\ngiving up an NLRA-protected right. That is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you have -- you have a\npark service of the State and have you a hotdog stand\nthere, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State\npays for everything. The State pays for everything.\nAnd it happens that, in the grant, they have no place\nfor talking about the union. You're saying they are\nrequired to add to the legislation, a special grant, so\nthat the employer can speak of the union?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, a grant presents a\nslightly different problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? Because they\nsay here we are talking about 100 percent money that\ncomes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is\nuse that money for the State purposes, and those\npurposes do not include talking one way or the other\nabout the union.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, that may be the case\nfor a particular program or a particular grant, but\nthat's not what AB 1889 does, Your Honor. AB 1889\naffects on an across-the-board basis every single\ncontractor, every single employer doing business with\nthe State of California. So if -- if the State could\nshow that it were making that -- it was making that\npolicy decision for some fiscal purpose, then there\nmight be an argument. But that's concededly not the\ncase here, whereas --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you -- you are\nbringing a facial challenge, and I thought that you must\nshow, not that the State must show, and the State -- the\nsimple argument is look we are paying for certain\nthings, and we want to get what we paid for. There are\na lot of other things that we could have paid for, but\nwe -- we want to get, say, a training program for\nelementary schoolteachers. And that has nothing to do\nwith union organizing. We don't want to pay for union\norganizing.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: That might be an argument\nthat the State could advance credibly if in fact this\nstatute had anything to do with saving money. It\ndoesn't. The court below unanimously concluded that\nthis was not anything that had anything to do with the\nfiscal issues; it had solely to do with making labor\npolicy. And as far as a facial challenge is concerned,\nYour Honor, the fact is that this statute was applied to\nthe Petitioners. The Petitioners --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the lower court\nsay it has nothing to do with the State getting what it\nis paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want\nto pay for?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, Your Honor, that's, of\ncourse, my vernacular for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That in --\nMR. GOLDSMITH: -- what the court said, but\nwhat the court did say was that the State passed --\nlegislature passed and the governor signed AB 1889\nsolely for labor policy purposes, and that's clear from\nthe preamble to the statute. The preamble to the\nstatute says, it is the policy of the State of\nCalifornia -- in so many words -- that employer speech\ninterferes with employee free choice. There's nothing\nin the record. There's no attempt at all to suggest\nthat anything achieved by 1889 saves the State a dime.\nThat's an argument --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would come out --\nit would come out differently if the statute has said,\nwe want to get what we pay for and we don't -- we choose\nnot to pay for labor relations?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Well, if the State could\nestablish that it was acting as a proprietor, within\nmeaning of this Court's decision in Boston Harbor, and\nestablish as a proprietor that it was doing something to\nadvance a fiscal purpose, then perhaps a statute so\nworded would survive the pre-emption challenge. But\nthat is clearly not what happened here. There's no\nevidence that that happened, and that is not the purpose\nor the effect of AB 1889.\nAnd as to the facial challenge issue, if I\ncould answer both Justice Breyer and Your Honor, the\nfact is that this statute was applied to the\nPetitioners. The Petitioners went into district court\nand they said, this applies to us, it's burden some for\nus to do -- to do what the statute purports to require\nus to do. The district court granted an injunction and\nso on.\nBut whether it's a facial challenge or\nas-applied challenge I think really makes no difference\nhere. The Ninth Circuit found that AB 1889 was not\npre-empted as a matter of law. Our position is that AB\n1889 is pre-empted as a matter of law. The purpose and\neffect are clear. Sending this back to remand to\ndevelop facts or trying to sort this out and whether\nit's a facial or as-applied challenge really doesn't\nchange the basic fact that the court below, as I said,\ndecided this as a matter of law and NLRA pre-emption\ngenerally raises purely legal issues.\nThe legal issue is whether or not the\nFederal scheme has been interfered with, and I think\nthat any fair reading of this statute makes it\nabundantly clear that that's exactly what happened.\nCalifornia was very open about it. The preamble says\nprecisely that: We believe that employer speech\ninterferes with employee free choice. So that they\npassed a statute that is designed to and does severely\ninhibit an employer's ability to speak. That's what\nthey wanted to do; that's what they did; and that\ninterferes with the Federal policy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they say something\ndifferent from what Congress said in those three or four\nstatutes that were mentioned earlier?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: In terms of using the words\nassist, promote and deter, those words appear in those\nstatutes in that Medicare regulation, or statute,\ncomponent of the Medicare statute, and those appear also\nin, in AB 1899.\nBut, you know, again, Your Honor, from my\nperspective I think, you know, it's clear that nothing\nin those statutes changed the fundamental policy that\nspeech, free speech, for both employers and for unions\nis something to be encouraged in the context of a union\norganizing drive for a number of reasons, not the least\nof which employees are allowed and entitled to hear both\nsides of the picture before being put in the position\nwhere they have to make a choice. California believes\nthat employer speech is a bad thing. AB 1899 is a\nreflection of that. They believe it's bad because it\ninterferes with employee free choice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you take the example of a\nnursing home that participates in the Medi-Cal program,\nwhat does this require? They have to segregate the\nfunds that they get from the State, and they can't use\n-- is it the case they can't use any of those funds for\nunion-related speech or just the portion that does not\nrepresent profits?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: They can't use any of those\nfunds. The notion that profits -- the statute doesn't\nsay a word about profits, and, of course, if the statute\nwere to say something about profits, it would make\nsegregation of accounts problem in the statute even\nworse than it already is.\nBut what a nursing home has to do is to\ntrack every single possible circumstance under which an\nemployee of the nursing home engaged in speech that was\ndesigned to assist -- which don't happen very often,\npresumably -- promote or deter union organizing.\nAnd let me try to bring it down to what\nreally happens in the union organizing campaign. This\nis, by and large, a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour a day\noperation. There are any number of encounters during\nthe course of the union organizing drive that the\nemployer responsible for complying with AB 1899 may\nnever even know about.\nSo, for example, if an employee goes to his\nsupervisor and says union X is trying to organize\nnursing home, what do you know about union X? And the\nsupervisor says, well, the only thing I know about union\nX is they used to represent the nursing home across the\nstreet, and then that nursing home is now closed.\nNow, that may be a purely factual statement,\npurely true statement. That's certainly what the\nemployer would argue. What the union might argue is\nthat no, no. You have to put that in context, and that\nwas a statement designed to deter the employee from\nvoting for union X.\nNow, if the employer guesses wrong on that\nissue, that is the employer says, well, this is factual,\nit's not something designed to deter union organizing,\nhe is subject under the statute to litigation for not\nhaving segregated -- and I don't know what he would\nreally segregate; the statute is unclear. Do you\nsegregate the time? Do you account for the time that\nthe employer spent talking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if he guesses right,\nhe is subject to the litigation.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said if he guesses\nwrong, he is subject to litigation. He is subject to\nthe litigation even if he guesses right.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand unlike the prevailing party as the defendant, or the\nprevailing party will of course -- the prevailing\nplaintiff and the prevailing intervenors will recover\nreasonable costs of attorney's fees, the prevailing\ndefendant under this statute does not. There is --\nthere is no question that it's even impossible for an\nemployer under the situation that I described to\neffectively account for that encounter that I describe\nbetween an employer and employee.\nDo you take the 30 seconds that it took and\nallocate 30 seconds of the salary? Do you take the\novertime for the week that the supervisor might have\nworked? There is really no way that the statute allows\nfor that to happen, and it I think underscores the\ndegree to which this statute interferes dramatically\nwith NLRA protected rights.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nYou've got a friend on the other side still.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I\nforgot about that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe National Labor Relations Act manifests\ncongressional intent to encourage free debate on issues\ndividing labor and management. State laws that restrict\nspeech regarding unionization frustrate that fundamental\nnational policy and are therefore pre-empted, as this\nCourt held in Linn.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nspending clause question? You -- the Federal Government\nhas a lot of programs where they use their own money and\nthey come with a lot of conditions, and you -- your\noffice frequently argues that those are justified under\nthe spending clause. Why isn't what California is doing\nhere similarly justified?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, first of all, obviously,\nYour Honor, the National Labor Relations Act does not\nconstrain Congress' ability to impose particular\nrestrictions. It does constrain the State's ability to\nuse their spending power to regulate, as this Court held\nin Gould and in Nash.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we tell\nwhether they are using their spending power to regulate\nas opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done\nwith State funds?\nMR. HUNGAR: The Court has identified\nseveral factors that it has used to distinguish\nregulatory from proprietary conduct, first and foremost,\nas this Court said in Boston Harbor. It looks to\nwhether the State is acting in order to effectuate\npolicy or is instead seeking to achieve cost savings\nprogram efficiency and the like. In addition, the Court\nlooks to whether the measure --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On a case like Rust\nversus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to\npromote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary\ncapacity?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, of course, that question\ndid not come up in Rust against Sullivan because there\nwas in a NLRA pre-emption issue there, and the question\nthat the State was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about\nspending power versus regulatory power in general.\nMR. HUNGAR: But what the Court did say in\nRust is that the government has a legitimate policy\ninterest in advancing its preference for life, in that\ncase, that the Congress was entitled to advance. The\nproblem here is that the policy interest that the State\nis advancing, a policy interest that says employer\nspeech regarding unionization interferes with employee\nfree choice, is a policy that is directly contrary to\nthe Federal policy under the Act as Congress and the\nboard have repeatedly recognized, and that this Court\nhas repeatedly recognized.\nSo, there is no legitimate interest\nsupporting what the State is doing here, it's an\ninterest directly contrary to Federal policy, unlike in\nRust and other First Amendment cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, give me an\nexample of a spending clause provision that would be\nacceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in\ngeneral, because you would say, well, that's not trying\nto implement a policy at all.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, if the -- one of the\namicus briefs in this case points to a rule that the\nState has adopted recently apparently in the Medi-Cal\ncontext, which says that they will only reimburse\nadministrative costs of hospitals up to the 50th\npercentile of costs incurred by similar facilities.\nThat's obviously not attempting to regulate\nany particular labor speech or any other type of\nconduct. It's simply saying we are only going to\nregulate this category, this broad general category of\ncosts to a certain level. It's not targeted at a\nspecific category of disfavored speech because the State\ndisfavors that speech. It's simply attempting to save\nmoney.\nThat clearly would not be pre-empted, even\nthough it might have a disproportionate impact on a\nparticular hospital that's engaged in a costly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would your answer be the\nsame if -- if -- and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps,\nthat a magic administrative scheme were invented so that\nthere was no administrative problem, we could identify\nwith the greatest of ease each penny that came from a\nState and which did not? And then the State said, you\nknow, we do have a policy here. We actually favor labor\nunions in our State, and some other State might have a\ndifferent policy. But we think it best that the State\nofficials involved when their company -- when their\ndepartment is being organized, to say nothing. We think\nit best that the employers that we pay a hundred percent\nto, given their -- their strong funding by the State,\nthat they got to find some money elsewhere, and those we\npay 50 percent to better use the private money, not use\nour money.\nNow, no administrative burden whatsoever,\nbut that's the policy. Now, is there some rule or\nstatute that would make that unlawful or pre-empted that\npolicy?\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer, I think -- I'm\nassuming in your hypothetical that this hypothetical\nlaw, in addition to posing no administrative burdens\nalso doesn't have the strict liability of treble\ndamages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, on all these things\nwhich I think they are asking us on the other side to\nleave for another day, none of them exist. They all\nwork perfectly. It's only the magic system has been\ndeveloped to, without any extraneous burden, segregate\nthe State money from the non-State money. And the only\nrule is don't use the State money when you speak.\nThat's the only rule.\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: By the way, other states\nhave exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work\nstates. They give you extra State money. So -- but one\nState has this rule and --\nMR. HUNGAR: Obviously that would be a very\ndifferent case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, well, if it's a very\ndifferent case, then why aren't they right to say this\nis a facial challenge, leave that very different case\nwhich raises all the issues to be worked out when we\ndiscover whether this is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say it's a very\ndifferent case Mr. Hungar? I don't really understand\nit.\nMR. HUNGAR: It's a very different case in\nthe sense that in this case it's -- from every one of\nthe factors that this Court has looked to, to determine\nregulatory versus proprietary -- and this case cuts\nfairly in favor of the conclusion of the unanimous court\nof appeals, all 15 judges, that this is regulatory.\nIt's punitive; it's government-wide; it's not program-\nor contract-specific; it's not the kind of conduct that\nprivate entities engage in. All of the factors -- and\nit's expressly as well as obviously, in effect, intended\nto disfavor a particular kind of speech that Congress\nfavors.\nSo everything cuts in favor of it being\nregulatory; whereas, in your hypothetical, most of those\nconsiderations would not. However, I think it's still\nthe case that in that hypothetical, what the State is\ndoing is regulating -- for labor policy reasons it's\ndisfavoring a particular type of speech. The State does\nnot have any obligation under the Act to fund\nunionization speech, but what it can't do under the Act\nis deny a government benefit because of a -- a labor\npolicy. That's what this Court held in Nash.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is my right-to-work example\nequally -- equally pre-empted?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, I think it would be. But,\nagain --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, they could not say in\nUtah, to take a State at random, the -- here we have\ngovernment grants and there's overhead, and we would\nlike you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're\ncertainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as\nmuch as you want, should there be an organizing\ncampaign. Don't worry about spending the government\npart. Can they do that? You say no, they couldn't?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well -- I took your -- the Utah\nexample to be one where the State was somehow mandating\nthis particular expenditure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. HUNGAR: If the State is simply -- is\nnot taking -- is taking a hands-off approach, it's hard\nto characterize it as regulation. But what this Court\nheld in Nash, what this Court held in Gould, what this\nCourt held in Livadas is, when the State is denying\nbenefits -- even though there might be plenty of\nlegitimate reasons that might enable it to deny benefits\n-- if it's denying benefits for the purpose of advancing\nlabor policy in an area where Congress has said there is\nto be no regulation, that's pre-empted, and that's\ndoubly pre-empted here where the labor policy that the\nState is advancing is directly contrary to the Federal\nlabor policy that Congress and the Board have\nenunciated.\nAnd with respect to the facial versus\nas-applied or the suggestion that somehow because you\nmight be able to craft a statute that would achieve some\nof the effects of this statute in a nonpre-empted way,\nthat doesn't make this statute not facially pre-empted.\nThis statute has the punitive provisions with the strict\nliability, treble damages, the segregation requirement\nthat's virtually impossible to apply in practice, the\nclear expressive mission of a regulatory policy that's\ncontrary to Federal policy.\nThis is the statute that is in front of the\nCourt. This is the statute that is facially\nunconstitutional, and that's the issue that the Court\nshould decide in order to correct the Ninth Circuit's\nerror, which said it's both facially and as applied\nimmune from pre-emption challenge before it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What policy was Congress\nimplementing in the Federal funding statute that\nCalifornia copied?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, California did not\ncopy any Federal statutes. None of the Federal statutes\nhas a segregation requirement; none of them imposes\nstrict liability, punitive damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they do say that the\nmoney is not to be spent to assist, promote, or deter\nunion organizing.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, there are three Federal\nstatutes that impose use restrictions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do they do that?\nMR. HUNGAR: It's not clear why they did\nthat, other than obviously they were choosing not to\ncompensate those particular kinds of costs as well as\nthe others. Congress is entitled to carve out\nparticular exceptions to the general nonregulatory\nprovisions of the Act, just as it has done in section\n8(c), where they have carved out coercive employer and\nunion speech for regulation, even though other speech is\nto be unregulated.\nIt's important to understand also that the\ngeneral policy in Federal grant programs is to the\ncontrary. There is no such restriction in the vast\nmajority of Federal grant programs involving the vast\nmajority of Federal grant money.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't -- there's\nno reason, rhyme or reason to what they would have done\nin these three statutes that you say is flatly contrary\nto national labor relations policy?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it's not contrary to\nnational labor relations policy, because Congress has\nchosen to create an exception, and it has the right to\ndo so; the State does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was labor policy. I\nmean, you have to acknowledge it was labor policy in\nthese other cases, just a different labor policy that\nthe Federal Government wanted, right?\nMR. HUNGAR: In -- in a specific program --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- which obviously the State's\nlaw does not apply to those programs; it applies to\nState spending across the board.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar.\nMr. Gottesman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nUntil this statute was enacted, California\nwas in the anomalous position that it was financing\nspeech on one side of union organizing campaigns but not\non the other, because most grants, programs, contracts\ninclude employment costs as an allowable cost.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so was anyone\nwho hired a company to do any kind of work, right?\nBecause the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try\nto restrict what activities the company engaged in with\nrespect to union organizing.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. I mean, a private\nemployer could have said the same things that the State\nsaid: don't use our money to do this. And they would\nnot have violated anything by doing that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not sure why you\ncharacterize California as financing one side of a\ndebate, because -- and this I think is sort of the nub\nof the disagreement between the two sides here -- their\nargument is that a State can determine what it wants to\nbuy with its money, but what California is doing is\ntelling its contractor what it can do with the money\nafter the State has got what it paid for.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That's not correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That's what they claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that is the\nbasic distinction between a case like Rust and a case\nlike this.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They're trying to control\ntheir profits as opposed to determining what they get --\nwhat you get for your money. And how do you respond to\nthat?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's true if it were\nthe case that the State's statute said: Even after you\nhave earned this money by performing all the service we\nasked, you still can't -- it's therefore now your money;\nyou can't use it. That is not what the statute means.\nThat is -- the State has been very clear about that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is there any case in\nwhich California claims that it has not gotten the\nservice that it paid for as a result of the position\nwhich an employer -- a grantee employer took on -- on a\nunionization issue?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, there haven't been any\ncases decided under this statute, but what the court of\nappeals pointed out is that the Petitioners did not move\nfor summary judgment on the ground that you're\nforbidding us from using our money. They moved for\nsummary judgment solely on the ground that it was the\nobligation of the State to give them money that they\ncould use for these purposes. And that it was wrong --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not quite\naccurate. They moved for summary judgment on the ground\nthat what the State was doing was in effect regulating\nlabor relations --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and that that\nactivity was pre-empted.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right. Well, yes, on that\ncore issue, they said to -- to tell us that we cannot\nuse State funds for this purpose -- well, they are still\nState funds -- is to regulate us. And we submit that\nthat is wrong. This is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say \"while they\nare still State funds\" -- the -- the money that the --\nthat any employer is using, I presume, to the extent\nthat it can be identified, is money in the employer's\npocket. And the only claim that California would have,\nit seems to me from the pre-emption argument, is that in\nfact we are buying a form of speech or a form of\npromotion of labor policy when we contract with social\nservice agencies or whatnot. But I don't understand\nthat to be California's argument at all.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: No. Our argument -- let's\ntake one of the two provisions that the district court\nstruck down, and that Petitioners argue properly struck\ndown. It said that when we give you grant money, don't\nuse that money for this purpose. Now, the State gives\nthem the money up front, before they have provided the\nservices. And that's true universally.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if they give them\ngrant money -- let's say it's a grant rather than a\ncontract, and I assume that's, you know, the point\nyou're making. When they give them grant money, I\nassume they're giving them grant money in order to do or\nto perform whatever kind of service or function the\nagency is devoted to performing.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Not to -- not to enforce\nlabor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the\narts or conservation or whatever the organization does.\nAnd there's no argument here that the organization is --\nis failing to promote conservation or the arts or\nwhatever, and that for that reason, California isn't\ngetting what it's paying for. The argument is that\nwhatever California has to -- I'm sorry, whatever the\norganization has to spend, say, on its labor relations,\nwhich is something that is left over from its promotion\nof the arts, cannot be spent except in accordance with\nCalifornia policy.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, first, if they don't\nspend all the grant money on the prescribed purposes,\nthey have to give it back to the State because grants\naren't profit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I assume they are\nentitled to some overhead cost which would include the\ncost of their employee-related -- managing employee\nrelations?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right. And that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that wouldn't be money\nleft over. That would --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right, but that, Your Honor,\nis where the concern that the State was addressing comes\nin.\nTraditionally, when the State gave grant\nmoney, one of the permissible uses of that money was for\nthe costs of employees who had to perform the grant, and\nwithout this limitation, that would have included the\nemployer spending the money to combat unions. That\nwould be -- could arguably be a legitimate cost.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, is the argument that\nthe employer in fact -- that the employer is in fact\ndevoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the\ngrant, so that it falls within Rust?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well -- yes. Well, our\nposition is certainly yes. That is, the State is\nentitled to prescribe what it is prepared to pay for in\na grant and what not, and it is not required to\nsubsidize the employer's campaign --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: -- against a union or for a\nunion, for that matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The difference between this\nand Rust is that the Federal Government in Rust was\nassuredly following a Federal policy.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it was a Federal policy\nthat the Federal Government had every right to\nimplement. We do not want to support abortions.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The issue here is whether\nthe policy that California is trying to implement --\nnamely, we do not want the employer to -- in its view --\ndisrupt the -- the labor management relations by -- by\nopposing union -- unionization.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that is the issue,\nwhether that is a policy that California can -- can\nimplement.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That is not the State's\npolicy, and the preamble to the statute does not say:\nthe State disapproves of employers spending money. What\nit says --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the policy\n-- the policy is they don't want employers to talk about\nunionization.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: No. They don't want them to\nspend them the employer's money -- the State's money to\ntalk about unionization.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Because it's wasting\nthe money or because that is their --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Because the State wants --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- their labor policy?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Because the State wants to\nbe neutral, and that -- the right --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then that -- then that, it\nseems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment\nago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's\ngetting less of what it thought it was getting for with\nits grant, because more is being spent on labor policy.\nAnd now, it seems to me, you're saying no, that's not\nthe case. It is simply the fact that the time that the\nemployer spends in talking with employees, whatever the\nsubject is, involves a policy that California does not\nwant to support, and, therefore, California prohibits\nthem spending that time for purely policy reasons.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it prohibits them\nusing the State's money to do it. Of course they can\nuse their own money to do it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument a\nmoment ago is that they were using the State's money\nbecause in fact they were providing less of the service\nthat the grant was for and spending that in -- in\nconversation with employees about labor unions. And it\nseems to me your answer to Justice Scalia was\ninconsistent with that. Your answer to Justice Scalia,\nas I understood it, was it is simply that they do not\nwant that policy being implemented by anyone who gets\nany money from the State within that State.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: I don't think I said\n\"inconsistently.\" What I said was, previously it was\nwithin the permissible scope of a grant to spend money\nin an organizing campaign, either assisting, promoting,\nor deterring unionization. The State is now saying that\nwill no longer be. We don't really want to spend grant\nmoney on that, and our reason is that we think we -- the\nState's money should not be used by either side in that\nunion organizing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that -- how\nis that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an\nOSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective\ndevices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want\nto get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be\nused to put in these federally required safety devices;\nyou can use somebody else's money for that. Why isn't\nthat the same thing here? You're saying there's a\nFederal labor policy that allows this, and we don't want\nour money to be spent implementing that policy or\npursuant to that policy.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Because there is no Federal\nlabor policy that requires States to use State treasury\nmoney to finance a party who is engaged in this debate.\nThat's why this is just like Rust.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just like -- like Gould. I\nmean, there is a case where a State used State money, no\ncontracting with any -- with any company that's been\nconvicted of unfair labor practices three times.\nStrictly State contracting policy, we just don't want to\nspend our money dealing with such a person.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right, but there we're\nsaying we won't deal with you. That's -- that would\nclassically -- if the State in this case said, no\nemployer who opposes unions can have a State contract,\nthat would be Gould. It would also be a violation of\nthe First Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that be the\nState's managing its own money? It's our money.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, But it is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We just don't want to deal\nwith people who oppose unions.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: No, there's a huge\ndifference between saying, don't use our money to do\nsomething, and saying, we won't deal with you even when\nyou use your own money to do it. The implication that\nthis is pre-emptive --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But on your argument, there\nis no \"your own money.\" You're saying that everything\nthat the grantee gets in a grant situation is the\ngovernment's money.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that distinction that\nyou just made in answer to Justice Scalia could not be\ndrawn.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if they have their own\nmoney, they can spend it on that. They just can't use\nthe State's money.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, the hypothesis of this\nwhole argument is that we are talking with a grantee who\nwas fully funded by -- I thought fully funded by the\nState, and I thought that was your strongest argument.\nSo that this alternative -- well, you can use your own\nmoney -- is an alternative which, you know, by the very\nhypothesis that we are arguing on, will never exist.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if we have a grantee\nwho has no other money, that doesn't mean the State has\nan obligation to provide them money to oppose\nunionization. It would be very odd to believe -- and\nthis is, after all, implied pre-emption -- that it was\nCongress's intent without mentioning it to say that it\nis the obligation of States to provide funding to\nemployers to do this.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gottesman, can I ask\nsort of a background question to be sure I understand\nyour position?\nAm I correct in assuming that if the State\nof California had its labor relations agency make it an\nunfair labor practice to engage in this employer speech\ndescribed here, that that would be pre-empted?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Employer speech with its own\nmoney?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Of course that would be\npre-empted, absolutely pre-empted.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: If not pr-empted, it would\ncertainly be a violation of the First Amendment as well,\nto punish them for engaging in speech.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if they adopted the\nrule that the Federal labor board applied prior to the\nTaft-Hartley Act.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's what I'm asking.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Exactly. Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That would be pre-empted?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Of course that would be\npre-empted.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Our position, however, is\nthat it's quite different to say that the National Labor\nRelations Act requires the State to pay for these\nactivities. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It does require that this\n-- it arguably requires that this area of combat between\nlabor and management be unregulated.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right. And this is not\nregulation, for the very reasons that this Court in\nRegan and Rust and in a whole line of cases had said\nthat it is not regulation to simply say, we the\ngovernment are not going to pay for this activity.\nThat's all that California is saying in this\ncase: we are not going to pay for it. It's the policy\nof the State not to interfere in these union organizing\ndrives; therefore -- and this is the precise words of\nthe preamble -- \"for this reason, the State should not\nsubsidize.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think your reason for not\npaying for this activity is that you don't like this\nactivity.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That's not true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I call that -- I call that\nregulating the activity.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That is not at all the case,\nYour Honor. There's nothing in this preamble -- the\nother side keeps characterizing the preamble, which they\ndon't include in their statutory appendix, as saying, we\ndon't like the employer doing it. That's not what it\nsays; it's on page 3.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you allow the\nemployer to engage in all other employee relations, and\nyou're willing -- that can be done without -- the one\nthing the employer can't do is speak out against the\nunion. This isn't because you don't --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, you've got for or\nagainst. This is content discrimination, not viewpoint\ndiscrimination; and it is content discrimination whose\npurpose is to keep the State's funds out of this area of\ncontext. The taxpayers' money should not be spent\nsupporting one side and not the other in these disputes.\nThis court in the Linn case -- and I want to\nquote this sentence, because this is the key to why a\npolicy of neutrality with respect to the use of the\nState's money is not, you know, regulated. We -- this\nwas a case in which, to be sure, it was the Federal\nGovernment was denying food stamps to strikers. And the\nclaim was that was a violation of their associational\nrights under the First Amendment. Everybody else who\nsatisfies the test for food stamps is entitled to them,\nbut we are not going to give them to strikers.\nAnd when the Federal Government is asked why\nis that, they said, well, we don't want to get involved.\nTo be sure if we give them the money, that would make it\nlikely the strike would go on longer. But we are not\nbeing anti-union. We just want to be hands off. We\nwant to be -- we don't want Federal money spent to help\none side or the other in this labor dispute.\nAnd what this Court said was, we have little\ntrouble in concluding that that provision is rationally\nrelated to the legitimate governmental objective of\navoiding undue favoritism to one side or the other in\nprivate labor disputes.\nNow, that's the core of what this statute is\nabout. The labor union --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying it\ndoesn't give favoritism to one side or another?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: It just takes the State's\nmoney out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that depends, as\na practical matter, on the view that there are at least\nsome employers who would be arguing in favor of\nunionization?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it wouldn't matter if\nthey were arguing for or against. The point is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but my point is\nthat there are precious few who argue in favor of it.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right. Well that may well\nbe true, but the point is when they are arguing against\nthe union, until this statute State money was being used\nto argue against the union, the union was not getting\nany State money to respond. The State was funding one\nside of this dispute. And the notion that it was an\nimplied purpose of Congress in the National Labor\nRelations Act to compel States to fund one side of a\ndispute with a subsidy is -- would be remarkable.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, when the State pays a\nprogram participant -- let's again take the case of a\nnursing home -- for providing services to patients who\nare covered by Medi-Cal, and money is paid to the\nnursing home, it's your position that remains the State\n's money.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: If this -- if the nursing\nhome -- there are a number of different ways in which\nthis money is paid to the State. If the situation is\nthe nursing home first provides the services and when\nthey have done so billed the State for the money, that's\nnot State funds. Once they receive the money, since\nthey put the money up in front to provide the service,\nthey are being reimbursed for it, that's not the State's\nfunds. It's the State's funds if the State gives them\nthe money up front.\nAs is true universally with respect to\ngrants. We give you this money. This money now because\nof this statute its purposes are limited so that they do\nnot include engaging in -- one side or the other in\nunion organizing. If you have your own money, feel free\nto spend your own money on that, but we are not giving\nyou this money for that purpose.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just be clear. The\nstatute with reference to State contractors, which is\nthe $50,000 statute, and the statute with reference to\nprivate employers, which is the $10,000 statute, in all\nof those cases, the law is applicable only if the money\nis paid before all the work is done?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. If you look at the\ncontract one, which is not actually before the Court\nbecause nobody had standing -- the district court ruled\nto raise it -- it says the State funds to assist,\npromote or defer -- union organizing during the life of\nthe contract are not to be spent on this.\nSo once the contract is done, that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question of when\nthe contract is done is different from the question of\nwhen the money is paid.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Of course. Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is asking with when the\nmoney is paid.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: So when you pay the money up\nfront and you say here is your money to do the\ncontract --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the\nsituation in which the contract runs for a year and you\nbill monthly? On your theory the contract is still\ngoing on and yet there is no prepayment. I assume on\nyour argument they would be just as bound by the\nCalifornia policy as if they got a hundred percent\npayment up front.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's -- that's a\nquestion about a meaning of a provision that isn't at\nthis issue in this case. The ones that are at issue in\nthis case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you concede that\nif they -- if all they did under a 12-month contract\nwas -- was bill for services rendered every past 30\ndays, that there would be either no application of the\nCalifornia law or that the application would be\npre-empted?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That might well be the case.\nBut we don't have an interpretation of that provision of\nthe California law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. That was an\neither/or.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: Which might be the case?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Oh. I say it might be the\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's like saying yes.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOTTESMAN: But again, that issue isn't\nhere. What we've got here are programs, some of which\nthe State advances the money, and some of which it pays\nafter the services have been completed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you did on that point on\npage 27 and 25 and 29 of the AFL-CIO brief, I took the\nstatements there, where it would say \"organizations,\"\nnamely organizations, even those that receive a hundred\npercent of their money from the State are free to use\ntheir profits?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If there are any, or any\nother non-state moneys they had?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: And we the State responded\nsay the same thing in our brief. We say it at pages 26\nto 27: The State maintains a legitimate interest in\nprogram funds until such time as the program participant\nhas provided the State with a service the State has\nfunded.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if you sell them tables\nand they write you a check, the State, for the tables,\nat that point the check is yours?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Of course.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: There is no question about\nthat, because in that case, that would be covered by the\ncontract provision that isn't here. But it says once\nthe contract is completed, it's your money.\nSo the concern here only is that they not\nuse our money. The State's brief also says --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there is a\nwarranty for another year, say if these tables break you\nhave to replace them?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's a question\nof -- remember, neither of the lower courts has\ninterpreted this statute. This statute has never been\ninterpreted. That's -- and what the court of appeals\nsaid is that's because the argument that you all have\nbeen asking me about was not raised in summary judgment\nby the Petitioners. Their core argument is the State\nhas an obligation to subsidize our speech. And that's\nthe only issue they brought up on summary judgment.\nBecause Judge Beezer in the panel decision said, oh,\nlook at all these, quote, as he called them, horribles\nthat will come from this, Judge Beezer got into all\nthese issues: The accounting would be burdensome, that\nit's going to be the employer's own money.\nAnd what the majority said is, number one,\nthat's not here. And number two, they said this -- I\nbelieve it's on page 34 of the appendix but I'm not\ncertain of the -- wait a minute, I can tell you the\nexact page. Yes, it's page 34, in a sense the parade of\nhorribles goes far beyond the scope of plaintiff's\nfacial challenge, that is the challenge they brought on\nsummary judgment. The district court made no findings\nnor is there evidence that this statute, quote, \"co-ops\nthe payments for goods and services and profits realized\nunder a contract .\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your recommendation\nas to -- we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's\nthere, I put the thing that I've heard as -- well, the\nexample with the tables is an example of it. When does\nthe profit actually accrue? Is there treble damage\nprovision that makes this much worse? Are there\nadministrative requirements that in practice make it\nimpossible? Is it administered in such a way that the\nemployee we heard about would just not know what to say,\nthe employer's representative?\nAll those things could be problems, and you\nsay, well, they haven't been dealt with yet. And your\nrecommendation as to what we should do is what?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Is affirm, because all the\ncourt has said is the motion for summary judgment was\nimproperly granted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if we did that, how\nwould all these problems be worked out? I mean, how\nwould the arguments that you -- they think are far too\nburdensome, you think they are not and can be done\nproperly, how does that get worked out?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, first of all, let's\ntalk about the burdens, the accounting burdens, which\nare actually quite minimal under Medicaid, because they\nalready have to do this because the Federal Medicaid\nrequires them to -- to account for which were allowable\nexpenditures and which were not in a very detailed\naccounting form. And of course, the Federal Medicaid\nsays that this is not allowable expenditure, so they\nhave to do this anyway, half this money is Federal and\nhalf is is State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not going to go\nthrough all of these one by one, are you?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Pardon? No. I just wanted\nto give an example of that.\nBut with respect to each of these, we need\nto have a record. For example, on the burdens there is\nan affidavit from an accounting firm submitted by the\ndefendants that says this is really not burdensome at\nall.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you a basic\nquestion that doesn't require you to get into one by\none. Suppose you have a State that doesn't want to have\nits money used to assist unions. This is an antiunion\nState and it adopts the same kind of law that you have.\nAnd it simply says, none of -- none of this State's --\nyes, you can recognize unions if you like, but none of\nthe money that we give you --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Give who.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- shall be used -- shall\nbe used for collective bargaining or for any -- any\nactivities involving unions.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: That would be -- that would\nbe the moneys we give to the employer?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Same. Yes.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: I'm not sure which question\nyou're asking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To the employer. No\nemployer getting money from the State can expend any of\nour money -- the same way yours is -- in collective\nbargaining with unions or in anything else. Now, we are\nnot stopping employers from doing that. We just don't\nlike unions, and it's our money and we don't want this\nemployer to use it for unions. Would that be all right.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: I think that would be\nproblematic but only for this reason. If the employer\nis allowed to spend the State's money to -- to bargain\nwith nonunion employees and you know medical\nresearchers, whatever, negotiate contracts with them,\nbut the State says you can't do it for collective\nbargaining, then that is exactly the Livadas case. That\nis the case in which the State is saying your\nentitlement to a State benefit turns on whether you are\nunionized or not. In this case we'll let the employer\ndo this with nonunion employees, but not with unionized\nemployees. But if the State said we don't want to pay\nfor the costs of negotiating --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that -- why does\nthat make a difference? If it violates Federal policy,\nit violates Federal policy. Livadas said you can't do\nit because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor\nunionization, and not to deter.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right. But this statute\nneither favors nor deters. This statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same\nabout that other one.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: This statute simply says we\ndon't want to subsidize either party, and as a practical\nmatter we are only subsidizing one party in union\norganizing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So does the statute I\nposit. Just don't use State money. You can use all of\nyour own money to deal with unions; just we don't want\nour money used for it.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That clearly would be\nbanned and I don't see why yours is any different.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well because -- it would not\nbe banned if the State had said we don't want you to use\nState money to negotiate contracts with any of your\nemployees; that would not be banned. It would be banned\nif they singled out only unionized employees that you're\nnot allowed to use it with. You're allowed to use it\nwith nonunion employees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I want to get back\nto your responses on the procedural costs of the case.\nYou said we don't know what the regulatory burden would\nbe with respect to accounting rules.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. There is a State\ndisputed facts in the district court on that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make any\ndifference if the argument is which is what I understood\nit to be, that you can't regulate at all? It's not\nsimply that you can't regulate so long as it's\nparticularly burdensome, but you don't have the\nauthority to regulate in this at all.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: But our argument is that\nthis is not regulation. To say that the State money is\nnot going to be spent for this is not regulation. Just\nas Regan and Rust says --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets to the --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: It just says--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets to the\nspending clause question. We're not -- I mean, we can\naddress that without deciding whether the regulations\nare particularly burdensome. You were saying well, the\naccounting is not a big problem.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't mean\nthat it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, we are not regulating\nwhether the employer opposes unions. What we are\nregulating is what they do with the State's money.\nThat's the only regulation that's here. We are saying\ndon't use our money for this purpose. The only\nregulation that's going on is to see whether you use the\nState's money --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't seem to\nme to be responsive to my question. Your point was\nwell, we don't know how burdensome a particular\nregulation is. If you lose on the question of whether\nit's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to\nsee how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled\nto regulate at all.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if you say that a\nState's position, \"we don't want our money to be\nused\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're getting back\nto the spending question.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: -- is regulation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm putting that\naside.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: I'm having -- the problem\nI'm having with Your Honor's question is presuming the\nanswer to something. The -- if this is regulation, then\nthere is a serious prospect of its being pre-emptive,\nbut this is not regulation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of\nwhether -- regardless of whether it's burdensome\nregulation.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's regulation\nwhy isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary\njudgment. Not the spending question we have -- that's a\ndifferent issue. But if there is no difference with\nrespect to regulation whether it's burdensome or not, so\nwe don't have to have further proceedings on whether\nit's burdensome.\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Right. But the only issue\nthey raised on summary judgment is that to deny us your\nmoney, the State's money, is regulation. And our\nposition is that to deny you the State's money is not\nregulation, any more than it was in Regan, in Rust, in\nthis whole line of cases where the Court has said the\ngovernment's choice not to subsidize an activity is not\nregulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But on that point you're\nin disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and --\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Yes, we are. The Ninth\nCircuit misunderstood Boston Harbor. It thought Boston\nHarbor created two boxes that represented the whole\nworld. You're either a market participant or you're a\nregulator. That's not what Boston Harbor said, if you\ngo back and look at it. What Boston Harbor said, if you\nregulate you are vulnerable to pre-emption arguments; if\nyou are not regulating, then you are free of pre-emption\nconcerns.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the principal rationale\nfor the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your\nview?\nMR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it's not -- no. The\nNinth Circuit also talked about the First Amendment and\ngot it right. It said when it talked about the dissent\nhad said what this State is doing is violating the First\nAmendment, and the Ninth Circuit's response is no,\nthat's not right. All this is is withholding a subsidy,\nand the First Amendment cases are clear: that's not\nregulation of a speech.\nWhat the Ninth Circuit thought erroneously\nis that Boston Harbor had denied it the right to take\nthat same view, because it thought that Boston Harbor\nsaid that everything is regulation unless it's market\nparticipation, and that's not what Boston Harbor said,\nand this is not regulation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Goldsmith, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nI'd just like to make a few comments in\nrebuttal. First of all, the preamble of the statute\nmakes it absolutely clear as to what the State's purpose\nis. It's at page 3a of the appendix of the petition.\nIt says it is the policy of the State not to interfere\nwith an employee's choice about whether to join or to be\nrepresented by a labor union. For this reason the State\nshould not subsidize -- and so on.\nSo clearly the State has a labor policy\nposition. It's a position as I said at the outset that\nis completely contrary to that of the NLRA. The NLRA's\nposition is that employers just like unions ought to\nhave the right to speak in a noncoercive way to their\nemployees.\nSecondly, it is not our position that the\nNLRA requires the State to fund activities. It is our\nposition that the NLRA and the decisions of this Court\nmake it abundantly clear that the States are to stay out\nof this area altogether, period. And that would be the\ncase whether it is the kind of statute that Justice\nScalia was posing a question about, whether it was in\neffect anti-union or pro-union. It doesn't matter.\nThey are both pre-empted.\nThe State has no business making labor\npolicy. The decisions of this Court, the unanimous\ndecisions of this Court in several circumstances I think\nmake that very clear. And the Ninth Circuit did find\nthat for all practical purposes, the State was\nregulating by making labor policy.\nIf I could make two points about neutrality.\nFirst of all, the statute is anything but neutral.\nFirst of all, the State's policy is not one of\nneutrality. As I just read from the preamble they have\na position; the position is that noncoercive employer\nspeech interferes with employee free choice, and the\nstatute follows that position.\nThe decision to withdraw funds is not the\nsame thing as being neutral. Your Honor made a\nreference to the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment,\nCongress withdrew funds from -- from abortion\npractitioners. It was not neutral about abortion. And\nCalifornia here has made a judgment about noncoercive\nspeech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the Lyng\ncase that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that\nargument?\nMR. GOLDSMITH: The Lyng case seems to me to\nbe completely off the point on the pre-emption issue.\nBut there is no question, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat Congress can make judgments about what it chooses\nto fund or not to fund. That did not open the door to\nthe States to do whatever they wanted to do by way of\nfunding or not funding. Lyng addressed a\nconstitutional --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Lyng said that\nthe -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was\nmaking a choice on how to spend its funds. And I\nunderstood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too,\nhere, California is being neutral.\nMR. GOLDSMITH: But California is -- is not\nbeing neutral, not just because of what the preamble\nsays but because of the add-ons to the statute if you\nwill. California has taken it much farther than simply\nwithdrawing the subsidy. California has taken it to the\npoint that you're exposed to treble damages, but then\nyou have minute tracking and segregation of fund\ndetails, and California has taken it even one step\nfarther and said on the other hand, if you want to spend\nState money to facilitate union organizing, that's\nperfectly fine with us. You can spend money to give\naccess to union representatives to property. You can\nuse State money to -- to facilitate neutrality\nagreements of one sort or another. Anything that would\nhelp a union organize employees, that's fine by us.\nSo California is not neutral in the same way\nthat Lyng was neutral, but again I would suggest that,\nMr. Chief Justice, that Lyng didn't open the door, any\nmore than Rust or Regan opened the door to the States to\nmake labor policy by granting or withholding moneys in\nany way that they saw fit. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Goldsmith.\n"
