        "content": "(11:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 10-114, Fox v. Vice.\nMr. Rosenkranz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nMr. Fox has rock-solid legal claims against\na police chief based upon facts that were strong enough\nto send that police chief to prison. Yet he's been\nordered to pay all of the attorney's fees for an entire\n2-year course of a litigation because his lawyers\ndecided to plead and then drop a single Federal theory.\nThat award is wrong and it's not what Congress intended.\nCongress wanted to protect defendants from the lying or\nthe vexatious plaintiff who shouldn't be in court at\nall.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did we take the case on\nthe assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may\ndisagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption\nthat this was a frivolous cause of action?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the Court took\nthe case on the assumption that the legal theory was\nfrivolous, but that the underlying cause of action,\nwhich is to say the operative facts, were meritorious;\nand in fact they are meritorious. They are going to\ntrial in 2 weeks. And so this is a wrongdoing defendant\nagainst whom was pled a legal theory that we now assume\nwas frivolous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. I mean, my\ngoodness. You could say the same underlying facts\njustify, you know, a suit for -- for libel, and also\njustify a much -- a much greater suit. I'm not sure\nthat we look to simply the underlying facts. We look to\nwhat kind of liability was sought to be imposed upon the\ndefendant. That's what determines how much money the\ndefendant is willing to pay for his lawyer, and how much\nhe has to expend in defending.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, in this case\nthe liability was far greater for the State court claims\nthan for the 1983 claims. But Congress was concerned -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's not quite\nright. To the extent they overlapped, even on the\ntheory the Federal claims were presented, the plaintiff\nbelow was seeking attorney's fees -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- under 1983.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That was -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the city's liability\nwould be greater.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That was one incremental\nincrease. But the liability in this case on the\nconstitutional claim was for, and the reason it was\nfound to be frivolous, was that he was seeking liability\non a constitutional claim for being deprived of his\nright to run for office when in fact he won the office.\nThe intentional infliction of emotional distress, the\nreputational harm was far greater.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew\nthat, though, from day one. This case is brought in\nState court, it's removed to Federal court. Ultimately\nthe plaintiff says: I recognize that as a matter of law\nmy 1983 claim is no good. But the plaintiff didn't say\nthat until 18 months after the -- the transfer. So\ndoesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for\nrunning up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening\nthe Federal court, having discovery in Federal court,\ninstead of saying when defendant removed the case -\neither dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that\npoint that it had no merit so it's only the State\nclaims.\nI mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff\nbear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal\ncourt for 18 months?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is partial\nresponsibility, yes, Your Honor. But let's -- and I\nthink Your Honor is correct to be looking at the\nburdens. The burdens of the discovery were all the\nsame. It was the same nucleus of operative facts. Now,\nif this was indeed frivolous from inception, the\ndefendants could easily have filed a motion to dismiss.\nIt should have taken no time at all. And if there was\nincremental increase in discovery with respect to the\nFederal claims, then the defendants have only themselves\nto blame for not having moved to dismiss early on.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if Mr. Fox had filed\ntwo -- two actions, the Federal claim in Federal court,\nthe State claims in State court? Now, the Federal claim\nis handled in the same way that it was here. It's found\nto be frivolous. Would not the defendants be entitled\nto all of the time that they spent preparing for the\nFederal court case?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And they're simultaneous,\nsimultaneous, Your Honor? I -- that's a much harder\nquestion. I think the answer would be yes, they would\nbe entitled at least to those incremental increases in\nthe burden, but if -- if they're doing discovery on both\ncases, they can't say: Oh, well this is the -- all of\nthe discovery was Federal discovery, none of it was\nState discovery, when they were on the same facts.\nIt's the incremental burden when you've got\nthese, these intertwined -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You're proceeding on the\nassumption which I -- I think is certainly, based on\nwhat I know of the record, true here, that the State\nclaims are far from frivolous. But how is -- let's take\nanother case, where it isn't clear whether the State\nclaims are any more meritorious than the Federal claim.\nThen how is the Federal judge supposed to handle the -\nthe calculation of attorney's fees in the separate\nFederal suit?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: So, your Honor, we're still\noperating on the hypothetical that they're separate\ncases -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Yes.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- not intertwined?\nBecause my answer might be different.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the facts are -- the\nfacts are intertwined, but they're two separate cases.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have claims of unknown\nmerit in State court; you have a frivolous claim in\nFederal court.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: My answer to that\nhypothetical is the same as our point two, that if there\nis -- if there are fees to be awarded at all, they have\nto be fees that are tethered to the rationale for there\nbeing a right to attorney's fees in the first place,\nwhich is what was the incremental burden of the Federal,\nof the Federal lawsuit? And a judge would say -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you calculate\nthat? I mean that -- that's what the question was.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, it would\nbe very easy in this case. What you do is you look for\nentries or ask the defendant to come forward with\nentries that say this was specific to the Federal\nlawsuit; I had to -- I had to file a removal notice, I\nhad to litigate over -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an incredible\nburden to impose on the district court. It's hard\nenough for clients to read through these billing records\nand figure out what's valid and what's not, but to ask\nthe district court to then go through and look at it,\nand see -- and maybe it doesn't say, you know, \"1983\nsuit,\" \"State suit.\" Maybe it's just an entry. And\nthen you've got to go through entry by entry and say\nwell, now, was that for the 1983 action or was that for\nthe State court action?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that seems -\njust -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems\nto me to be an especially odd burden to impose when\nyou're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose\nof discretion to the district court in the first place.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, let me then\nstart -- move back to our overarching point, which is\nthat these are the sorts of incremental burdens that are\ntrivial, if they exist at all, and that shouldn't be\nawarded attorney's fees at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe in your\ncase, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be\ncases where the things are flipped, and the Federal\nclaim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than\na factual one, is the dominant driving force in the\nlitigation and you've tagged on a few other State\nclaims.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, that's a key\npoint in our presentation. It actually doesn't matter\nwhether it's flipped or not. The factual foundations\nare the same, by definition, for all of the legal\ntheories, so the factual -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, there -\nthere are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because,\nfirst, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under\ncover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary\nin the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show\nthat Vice was an official policymaker for the city.\nThose are discrete issues that relate to the 1983 claim\nbut have nothing to do with the extortion/defamation\nclaim.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Indeed, Your Honor, and so\nlet me answer that question in two ways. First is, if\nthe defendants see a complaint, a 1983 theory, that is\nflawed at the inception, they have no business incurring\ncosts with respect to color of State law or policymaker\nor not. They should move to dismiss on the theory that\nis presented on the face of the complaint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a pretty\naudacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause\nof action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time\nresponding to it.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, no, Your Honor. My\npoint is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a lot of\nchutzpah.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: You Honor, that's their\npoint. They're saying it was frivolous on the face of\nthe complaint. Well, if it was frivolous on the face\nfrom inception, they should have moved to dismiss from\ninception.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you shouldn't\nhave filed it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I understand the argument,\nYour Honor, but the Seventh Circuit has a very good\nopinion that's cited in the brief that explains that\nwhen the defendants are just racking up fees on a claim\nthat they claim is frivolous, that they could have filed\na motion to dismiss on, they shouldn't be racking up\nfees on that claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I\nunderstand what legal analysis you're proposing? Your\nblue brief seems to suggest, as does your argument a few\nminutes ago, that you want the Sixth Circuit's rule,\nwhich is the only circuit that applies this rule, that\nsays when the facts are identical and intertwined, the\ndefendant gets no fees.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of the other\ncircuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that\nextreme. They say something closer to what you started\nwith, and your yellow brief suggests, is a but-for\ncause: The defendant is entitled to those costs related\nto the defense of the frivolous claim. Which of the two\ntheories are you advocating?\nAnd then a separate question, of what\nstandard of review should be imposed in those situations\nin which the activities are so intertwined, but there is\nstill a core essence of defense of the Federal claim,\nwhich is some of the hypotheticals my colleagues -\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Let me\nbegin by -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- correcting the premise,\nif I may, Your Honor. The Sixth Circuit is an outlier,\nbut the Sixth Circuit is an outlier because it says if\nyou have got a lawsuit with related and completely\nunrelated claims, no fees at all. The majority rule,\nthe clear majority rule, is the rule that says no fees\nat all when you've got intertwined claims. That is the\nSixth -- which also has that other piece -- the Second,\nthe Ninth, and the Eleventh. And that is the rule -\nthat is the primary rule that we are advocating: No\nfees if they're intertwined, because the burdens of\ndemonstrating that a legal theory is frivolous are\nminimal. But we have a backup -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there are difference\n-- are differences in how we read those other circuits,\nbut I'll accept your proposition.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: And, Your Honor, I would\nencourage the Court to look at the -- at the Schwartz\ntreatise, which says what I've just articulated is the\nclear majority rule, not just among the circuits, but in\nthe district courts, where circuits haven't weighed in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I clarify what\nyou mean by \"completely intertwined\"? You mean there is\nno incremental work just on the Federal action?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. What I\nmean by \"completely intertwined\" is that they arise from\nthe same core of operative facts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you're\nlooking for fees -- your first argument -- even though\nthey can identify fees that were incurred solely on\ndefending the frivolous cause of action?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm looking to block fees\neven though they can, and the reason is Congress was\nconcerned about burdensome litigation, not about minor,\ntrivial increases in litigation to utter three sentences\nabout a legal claim and then say -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. That's\nan easier case. What if it's 20 percent spent on the\nFederal action? Do you still completely intertwine?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the premise\nhere is that the Federal action is completely frivolous.\nThere shouldn't be 20 percent spent on the Federal\naction if they're all -- if they're all intertwined, if\nit's frivolous on its face.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's not\ncompletely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a\ndemand for fees? What if it does take them, you know,\n40 hours to prepare the motion to dismiss it as\nfrivolous? Do they get those 40 hours?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I guess I'm\nhaving trouble accepting the premise. It shouldn't take\n40 hours to tell a court, here's the claim and here's a\nstring cite of 17 cases that say it's wrong.\nBut let me then move to the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've got to\nfind the 17 cases.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, but if it takes 40\nhours to do it, then it's probably not frivolous.\nBut let me move into the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to look\ncarefully at the facts. They assume good faith on the\npart of their adversary that would not file a frivolous\nclaim. The idea that it's going to be able to -\nthey're going to look at it and say, this is frivolous,\nfile a motion in Federal court, I think that's a -\ndoesn't reflect an adequate -- doesn't reflect a\nrealistic understanding of Federal litigation.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I understand, Your Honor.\nLet me just make one other point about our first rule,\nand then move to the second rule.\nThe point that was made earlier, that Your\nHonor made, Mr. Chief Justice, earlier about the burden\non the Court is yet another reason why we shouldn't open\nup this new avenue of ancillary fee litigation. When\nit's just that incremental burden, we now have not just\nthe burden of a frivolous claim, but the burden of\ncourts addressing attorney's fees applications and\nthe -- on the frivolous claim, and the burden of the\ncourts now of defendants playing the games of\nwithholding motions to dismiss that should have been\nbrought earlier -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't want to have\nyou adopt this phrase, but just to clarify, are you\nsaying that it's a but-for test, that you get only those\nfees for time that was -- that would not have been\nincurred but for the frivolous claim?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: So let me move now to the\nsecond argument, Your Honor, and the answer to that is\nyes. If there are going to be fees at all, the fees\nshould be tied to the basis on which Congress is\nallowing defendants to get fees, and that is defendants\nare suffering extra burdens; we want to protect them\nfrom those burdens.\nIf that is the rationale, as everyone\nagrees, then the only fees that should be covered are\nfees that would not have been incurred but for the\nexistence of the Federal claim, and that is, to the\nChief Justice's question, actually not that hard to\ndemonstrate. If plaintiffs keep good, accurate records\nand they know that they're going to be seeking or may\nwell be seeking fees on the Federal claim, identify the\nfew documents that are really -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not how\nit works. You say they know they're going to be seeking\nclaims. They don't know in advance, this is going to be\na frivolous claim, the discovery is going to be\ncompletely overlapping or it's not going to be\noverlapping. And most lawyers do not keep detailed\naccurate billing records. That's just an underlying\nreality.\nSo I do think it's a significant burden on\nthe district court to say, go back and read these -\nread these billing sheets, figure out which is which,\npresumably have litigation over it. Someone is going to\nfile a motion for these fees; the other person is going\nto say, no, no, it shouldn't be 20,000, it should be\n15,000. And our precedent in this area gives a huge\namount of discretion to the district courts, just\nreasonableness. And it seems to me you're buying into a\nlot of litigation to decide whether it's 20,000 or\n15,000.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Which is one of my reasons\nfor our underlying -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand you go\nback to the first point.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, let me -\nlet me just explain how I think this works. First of\nall, a lawyer who is -- who has a Federal claim against\nhim is duty-bound to start keeping track of the Federal\nissues early, just like the plaintiff who is going to\nseek fees is as well. But it isn't that hard, because\nthe vast majority -- in an intertwined case like this,\nthe vast majority of expenditures will be overlapping\nexpenditures. All of the discovery, or most of it, will\nbe overlapping.\nAnd the lawyer does have the obligation,\nthen, to say if there are separate things, it's the\nburden on them -- that is, the defense lawyer -- to\npoint out those incremental burdens that would not have\nbeen incurred but for -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, you're\nsaying that the lawyer has to keep account of -- now, if\nI'm going to spend time on \"under color of State law,\" I\nhave to label that and figure the hours for that\nseparately; similarly for whether Vice was an official\npolicymaker, those hours that you are requiring that -\ninstead of saying X number of hours for deposition of\nwitness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that's\nwhat Hensley says. Hensley says general litigation is\ngeneral litigation, and you don't try to parse it out,\nbut if there are -- in the case of plaintiffs, that\nredounds to the benefit of plaintiffs, because the\nentire case, all the general litigation, could have\ncontributed to the ultimate success.\nWhen it comes to the defendants, though, the\ngeneral litigation costs could easily or almost\ncertainly were incurred in connection with the overall\ndefense, and so it makes perfect sense to say to them,\nbreak out the pieces, the documents that were really\njust about the Federal lawsuit.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And Mr. Rosenkranz, in this\ncase what's your understanding of the approximate\npercentage of time that was spent on the Federal issues\nthat Justice Ginsburg was talking about?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Minuscule, Your Honor, and\nlet me refer the Court to the supplemental appendix. If\nyou look, for example, on page 30, that's where Vice's\nexpenditures begin. It goes for 37 pages. There is but\none reference to Federal law. It's like looking for\nWaldo, trying to find the theme that they claim was\ndominating this case, which is on page 38, one\nreference. And so I would say it's trivial. And\nparticularly, then, if we layer over this the\nproposition that the district court -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So there was no significant\nmotions practice on these issues? There was no\nparticular discovery on issues of State action and so\nforth?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: There was, and there was -\nand that was done mostly by the city. So the city was\nfocused on -- there was motions practice about some of\nthe legal theories, very little about the one that was\npurported to be frivolous. There was quite a bit about\ncolor of State law, policymaker, which, as I said\nearlier, certainly the district court should be -\nshould be encouraged to ask whether those should have\nbeen incurred or whether there should have been a motion\nfirst, and then there was the removal petition, and then\nthere were the arguments about whether it was frivolous\non the basis on which it was removed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the potential\nliability on the frivolous claim is much greater than\nthe potential liability on the factually interrelated\nnon- frivolous claims, and the defense argues that we\nspent a lot of time on -- a lot more time on these\ninterrelated factual issues because of our fear of the\ngreater liability on them than the frivolous claim?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: All right. Not this case,\nof course, and you know this is a hypothetical. The\nanswer to that would be, I can imagine a district court\nbeing allowed to carve out an exception where they can\nsay, well, we hired much more high-powered lawyers than\nwe would have otherwise, and that was the -- responsible\nfor an incremental increase.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, did the -- the\ndistrict court here said they're intertwined claims,\nthey all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled\nto full fees. The Fifth Circuit seemed to do the\nbut-for test. Are you agreeing with that?\nIt's -- the language it uses sounds like a\nbut-for test: \"A defendant is only entitled to\nattorney's fees for work which can be distinctly traced\nto frivolous claims. We are confident that the district\ncourt can assess the amount of attorney's fees\nattributable exclusively to a plaintiff's frivolous\nclaims.\" Is that correct?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: That is a correct quote, of\ncourse, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think they\nmisapplied that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: What I would say, Your\nHonor, is not that they misapplied it. They uttered one\nsentence that was correct. And then -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Two.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -then -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And they joined the\nNinth and the -- and the other circuits that have the\nbut-for. So it's three places. They said we're not\njoining an exclusive fees entitlement either way, we're\njoining what the majority of the circuits are doing.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, correct. So -- so\nthey uttered those sentences, those are correct. The -\nthe Fifth Circuit then applied a series of standards\nthat bear no relation to the but-for test. The Fifth\nCircuit -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not why we took\nthe case, to correct the factual application.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Agreed, Your Honor. I'm\nnot saying it was a factual misapplication. I'm saying\nevery sentence after that is a direct contradiction of\nthe but-for test. I mean, for one thing, it cannot\npossibly be true that you can apply a but-for test when\nno one has ever looked at the underlying records. The\ndistrict court said it didn't have to.\nThe Fifth Circuit said that the reason the\ndistrict court was correct was because the main focus of\nthe parties, what they had in their heads, was the\nFederal case.\nUnder a but-for test it doesn't matter what\nthey had in their heads. It matters whether the work is\nwasted, whether it's transferrable -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they messed up the\napplication of the but-for test. I thought the issue\nbefore us whether -- was going to be whether the but-for\ntest is a proper test, not whether this particular\ncourt, having expressed a proper rule, misapplied it. I\ndon't care about that.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I -- I\nunderstand your point. We're disagreeing about whether\nthis is simply a factual misapplication, which I believe\nit was not, or a statement of a series of standards that\nwhen district courts in the Fifth Circuit now apply\nthose standards we'll never get to the but-for test,\nbecause they will always ask, well, what was on their\nminds or what forum -- was the next sentence -- what\nforum was this litigation in? Well, it was in the\nFederal forum, therefore, they are just Federal fees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rosenkranz, I'm\nlooking at the billing sheet, August 14, 2007, 32 hours,\nmiscellaneous cost, online research. Is that for\nFederal or State?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's general\nresearch that I would say if the lawyers did not specify\nthat this was for specifically incremental increase in\nthe cost of the lawsuit on the Federal theory, then\nthey've lost the opportunity to try to make that case.\nThis is not a unique observation in civil\nrights litigation. Plaintiffs lawyers have to do that\nall the time. They -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- you -- you -\nyou've done this several times in the course of your\nargument, sort of equating, you know, the attorney's\nfees for frivolous suits with the normal attorney's fees\nthat the plaintiff gets when the plaintiff is\nvictorious. I'm not sure that we should treat the two\nsituations about the same, because the plaintiff gets\nhis attorney's fees whenever the plaintiff wins,\nwhenever the plaintiff wins, whereas the defendant gets\nthose fees only when the plaintiff has brought a\nfrivolous suit, which should not have been done, which\nis wrongful, which is perhaps sanctionable under Rule\n11. I'm not sure that we have to evenhandedly apply the\nsame kind of rules.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I actually\nbelieve that the Court should not be evenhandedly\napplying the same set of rules, but we reached the\nopposite conclusion about which side gets the benefit of\nthe burden. It is for plaintiff's benefit, for the most\npart, that this fee shifting provision was in the\nstatute.\nNow, this Court has so drastically narrowed\nthe range of cases within which a defendant is entitled\nto fees, that all we're talking about now is whether the\nCourt is going to open up a new avenue of fee\nlitigation, and that is not for the frivolous lawsuits\nbut for the frivolous theory layered onto an otherwise\nmeritorious lawsuit. If I -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, one -\none piece of this you must know the answer, under the\nLouisiana law we have the extortion, defamation, and\nemotional distress going forward in Louisiana courts.\nDoes Louisiana follow the American rule so that\nplaintiff even -- if the plaintiff prevails, there would\nbe no award of fees?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: My time is reserved for\nrebuttal, but I will answer the question, Louisiana\nfollows the American rules, so no fees on the State\ncourt claims. Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stancil.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to focus first on the question\nof eligibility, but I do want to return later to why\nHensley supplies the correct analysis for calculating\nfee awards.\nMuch of Petitioner's eligibility argument\nrests on the notion that frivolous section 1983 claims\nimposed only modest or as he described them today,\ntrivial burdens on defendants. And that's simply not\nthe case. As amici who deal with these cases on a daily\nbasis have confirmed, inclusion of even a frivolous\nsection 1983 claim imposes significant additional\nburdens as part of the litigation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't you prove\nthat?\nMR. STANCIL: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why can't you prove that\nin a but-for situation? Why don't you tell me what\nyou -- your proposed standard is. As I understand it,\nyou would say if the Federal claim is frivolous, then\nyou're entitled to all fees, even if the State law\nclaims overlap and have merit or potential merit. I\nthink -- is that your position?\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. I would like\nto clarify it. We are talking now about calculation of\nthe award, assuming eligibility aside for the moment.\nAnd I'll come back -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Eligibility, it has to\nbe a frivolous claim, that's -\nMR. STANCIL: Where eligible, the standard\nis, as under Hensley, what is the degree of overall\nsuccess in proving that these claims are frivolous?\nSimply put, how much of the action or proceeding to\nenforce section 1983 was frivolous? And that's the\nstandard set forth in section 1988.\nSection 1988 does not reference State law\nclaims that may be factually overlapping.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the liability\nunder the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability\nunder the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the\nFederal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I\nwere the client, I would say your degree of success was\nzero. I still have to pay $100,000.\nThe fact that you won on one claim but then\nlost the whole issue -- the whole value on another, I\nwouldn't call that a degree of success.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, that would be something\nthat a district court would take into account as part of\nits discretion, and that's exactly the point of Hensley.\nHensley says it's hard to pull some of these hours apart\nin the ordinary case.\nNow, this is not the ordinary case. I think\nthat's clear. Here the plaintiff did not even press his\nState law claims in Federal court. Those claims, the\ndistrict court found, were so deeply buried in the\ncomplaint that the plaintiffs were not even on notice\nthat a defense to them was required.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how that -\none can say that looking at the complaint. It said\nextortion, emotional distress -- where is the complaint?\nLet's look at it.\nMR. STANCIL: It's at pages 37 to 43 of the\njoint appendix, Your Honor. And I would -- I direct the\nCourt to page -- specifically to pages 41 and 42 of the\njoint appendix.\nThe only cause of action actually set out\nhere with any specificity is section 1983. If you look\nat page 41, it says the rights, privileges and\nimmunities afforded by petitioner -- afforded petitioner\nby our Constitution and laws that were violated\nincluded -- include but are not limited to the\nfollowing, and then he lists the right to seek public\noffice, the right to be free from extortion, the right\nto be protected -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right to be free from\nextortion.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. And then -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -\nMR. STANCIL: Yes -- no, Your Honor.\nThat's -- that is what he said his right was denied as\npart of his rights, privileges and immunities afforded\nPetitioner by our Constitution and laws. He says on the\nnext page, on page 42, and this is a critical\ndistinction, and I think this was the premise of the\ndistrict court's finding: He says Petitioner has\nsuffered and is entitled to recover reasonable sums for\nthe following items of damage as a direct result of\nactions of defendants; and that's where he lists past\nand present -- past, present, and future emotional\ndistress, embarrassment, humiliation, reputation,\npunitive damages, and other relief, and other damages to\nbe proven at the trial of this matter.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not\nfamiliar with Louisiana standards of pleading.\nAfforded -- under 16 at page 41, the rights, privileges\nand immunities afforded Petitioner by our Constitution,\nFederal, and laws, State and Federal.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would seem to me\nreading the complaint would permit that.\nMR. STANCIL: I think that would be -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't know what\ndegree of specificity is required.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I think that would be\nmore than generous under the -- in the context, and then\nyou would do what the district court said and look how\nthe parties acted from this point forward. And the\ndistrict court found that the defendants, that these\nclaims were not sufficient reply pled -- this is on\npages, I believe, 20 -- pardon me, 32 and 33 of the\npetition appendix: \"Plaintiff made certain allegations\"\n-- this is the district court -- \"that could be\ncharacterized as State law tort law claims, but\nPlaintiff did not plead -- did not make these\nallegations separate from the section 1983\" -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nLouisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the\nbasis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal\ntheories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant\nremoved this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted\nto keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the\nLouisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly\nappropriate.\nThe -- the claim alleged gave rise to\nextortion claim, the defamation claim; so this complaint\nwas filed in Louisiana court that has a rule that says\ntell us what happened, and then you can have whatever\nlegal theory you're entitled to.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor, but it\nincluded a Federal cause of action that allowed removal\nto Federal court, and once it's in Federal court, it's\nsubject to the Federal rules for pleading a claim\nadequately and in specificity, and here the district\ncourt found these State law claims, there was not a\nwhiff of them until the very tail end, 18 months later,\nwhen it was actually in response to the town of Vinton\nsaying, by the way, just to be clear, there are no State\nlaw claims here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that implausible,\nMr. Stancil, when we consider that of all the claims\nhere, the one that would seem easiest to prove is\nextortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a\ncriminal proceeding? So if you're looking look and you\nsay what is the outstanding claim here, I would assume\nthat it was the extortion.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, again, look\nat how the plaintiff used the fact of extortion. If you\ngo -- this is the correspondents -- pardon me, the\npleadings on summary judgment when plaintiff filed a\nmotion for summary judgment. The defendant said you've\nsaid nothing about under color of law; this is an\nanonymous claim. He says he -- he didn't say this was a\nState law claim for extortion. He said, and this is a\nquote, he says: \"It is not necessary to show that Vice\nwas acting under color of law. The simple act of\nextortion is sufficient.\" He picked the section 1983\nhorse. He rode it as far as he possibly could, and only\nat the 11th hour, when the district court finally called\nhim on to the carpet, did he say, okay, I concede these\nclaims have no merit, and then he backed off and then he\nwanted to go -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court was\nprompted to do that by your motion for summary judgment.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and that\n-- that's how -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you could have\nbrought that motion very early on. If this is a\nfrivolous claim on its face, then why didn't you move to\nhave it dismissed immediately?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, that's a very important\npoint, Your Honor. It I think is a false assumption\nthat every claim or this claim or pieces of this claim\nare frivolous on their face such that you can look at\nthe complaint and have it thrown out of court. I would\nlike to point, Your Honor, specifically to the\nallegation -- this is on page 49 I believe of the\nappendix -- in which -- this is an allegation of the\ncomplaint where plaintiff says that Vice printed the\nextortion letter at the police station. Presumably this\nis in support of his under color of law theory.\nHe's deposed -- this is on page 330 and 332\nof the joint appendix -- and Fox admits he had no basis\nfor that claim. We can't walk into Federal court and\nsay we know this is false, we know he didn't print this\nat the -- at the police station, he didn't use police\nresources to do it. We have to depose him, we have to\nmarshal the facts, and then we have to go in on summary\njudgment and prove that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil, can I get you\nto just think about a hypothetical with me? There's a\nplaintiff and he files a suit and it has a State claim\nand a Federal claim; and the Federal claim is a really\nbad claim, it's frivolous; and it eventually gets tossed\nout, and it's -- it's labeled frivolous. But the State\nclaim is a really good claim and it wins, all right?\nThe plaintiff has requested $100,000 and the\nplaintiff gets $100,000 because he's won on the State\nclaim. Now, here are the legal fees. The legal fees\nare 20 percent was incurred solely for the State claim,\n20 percent was incurred solely for the Federal claim,\nand 60 percent was incurred in both because there were\noverlapping issues and it's just impossible to tear them\napart.\nMR. STANCIL: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What are the fees in that\ncase according to you?\nMR. STANCIL: It would be within the\ndistrict court's discretion. I think it's going to be\ncloser to 20 percent than to 80 percent. But again,\nthis is the central message of Hensley, and I think\nit's -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So -- but -- so in\nother words, you're saying he gets all the work, the\ndefendant gets the work done on the Federal claim\nnotwithstanding that the plaintiff has gotten his entire\nrelief; is that right?\nMR. STANCIL: He gets -- yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All the work that is -\nMR. STANCIL: At a -- at a minimum.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Even though the plaintiff\nhas, from the plaintiff's view has completely won the\nlawsuit.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, he has -- yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Go -\nMR. STANCIL: Is there a follow-up? I don't\nwant to interrupt the follow-up.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No. Go ahead.\nMR. STANCIL: Okay. Yes, he gets the 20\npercent at a minimum that are but-for attributable, but\nit is within the district court's discretion to award\nmore, and here's why.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and -- okay, go\nahead, I'm sorry.\nMR. STANCIL: The burden -- the question is\nwhat is -- what does section 1983 authorize? It\nauthorizes fees if you're a prevailing party entitled to\nfees in an action or proceeding to enforce section 1983.\nIn Your Honor's hypothetical and in this case, there was\nonly frivolous section 1983 claims. So in terms of\nfulfilling the -- the mission, the statutory purpose\nunderlying section 1988, I think it would be incumbent\nupon the district court to say, you know what, this\nentire -- you -- you triggered a fee-shifting statute,\nthe entire section 1983 action was frivolous. And so I\nthink it's within the district court's discretion to\ngive them something more, between 20 and 80 percent\nunder those -- under the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So but on that theory,\nthe -- the plaintiff would be paying the defendant's\nfees for work done where the plaintiff won.\nMR. STANCIL: Because the plaintiff levied a\nfrivolous -- not just a faulty or unsuccessful, a\nfrivolous cause of action under section 1983, and this\nis the point of -- of why 1988 is different from, say,\nrule 11 and other provisions that limit bad faith\nactions. It's a policy choice by Congress. There are\nburdens allocated to both sides, and there are\nconsequences or may be consequences within a district\ncourt's discretion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I thought what\nCongress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the\nonly thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is\nthe burden of the frivolous Federal claim. Your -- your\nanswer to Justice Kagan is suggesting that even if the\nplaintiff wins, wins everything they were seeking,\nyou're still entitled to 80 percent of your fees, even\nthough the Federal claim didn't add anything to your\nwork -- to your work, except 20 percent?\nMR. STANCIL: To be clear, Your Honor, I'm\nnot saying we would be automatically entitled to 80\npercent. I'm saying Hensley, under the principles of\nHensley, the district court would have discretion to\naward more than 20 percent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me why we\nwould, given the differences that we've announced in\nHensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing\ndefendants -- because you can only prevail as to a\nfrivolous fee. Why do we start with your entitlement to\nyour entire fee and deduct from it, instead of starting\nthe other way, which seems more logical, which is you're\nentitled to the fees related to your frivolous claim, so\nwhy don't you have to prove that first?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I don't think it would\nmatter to the outcome of this case, and I would like to\ncome back to that. But the reason for starting at what\ndoes -- what is the 1983 fee in total, and working\nbackwards from there, is based on -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. No, no, no. We're\nassuming a lawsuit that has -- as this one, that has\nboth Federal and State claims and only one -- whether\nit's one frivolous Federal claim or multiple Federal\nclaims and two are frivolous, one is not, and there is a\nbunch of State court claims.\nMR. STANCIL: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do we start with\nyour total fee and deduct down, rather than start where\nall the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can\nbe attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only\nthing you're entitled to fees from?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, section 1988 is the\nanswer, Your Honor. It says you get your fees, and -\nif you're a defendant and if it's frivolous. With\nrespect to an action or proceeding to enforce\nsection 1983, I think the but-for rule would make more\nsense if we were talking about non-frivolous\nsection 1983 claims alongside frivolous section 1983\nclaims, because there the pie that section 1988 is\nconcerned about, the 1983 pie, is chopped up, but here\nwe have a State law pie and we have a 1983 pie, and all\nof this pie, if you'll pardon the tortured metaphor, is\nfrivolous.\nSo you look at the terms of the statute.\nWhat has Congress authorized? Your fee for a frivolous\nsection 1988 claim. We say, and for, I think, good\nreason, that it's consistent with the congressional\npurpose to consider whether to reduce that award. You\ndo not have to award them the entire pie, but I think it\nis a faulty assumption. It doesn't fulfill the purposes\nof section 1988 to say, well, if you invoke this\nfrivolous claim and you put this fee shifting on the\ntable, that you're immune from fee shifting as long as\nthese claims are -- certain fees are relevant to both.\nBut I do want to come back to why this makes\nno difference to the outcome of this case. Not only is\nthat the standard that the Fifth Circuit announced and\napplied, but it is also the case that the only claims\nprosecuted in Federal Court were section 1983 claims.\nAnd here, we have to come back to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stancil, the first\nmagistrate to get this case said explicitly that the\ndiscovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court,\nwould be usable in State court proceedings where those\nmaterials might aid in obtaining a judgment. So doesn't\nthat have to be taken into account, that the discovery\nmaterials developed in Federal Court will now be used in\nthe State court proceeding?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, there's a\ndifference between saying these depositions may be used\nand saying they will be useful or finding that they\nwould be significant to the disposition of the State law\nclaims. The District Court said only -- the first\nmagistrate judge's opinion said only that these\ndepositions may be used. This is a simple way of\ntelling the parties, you know, don't come back to me and\nargue about whether this deposition was properly noticed\nand, you know, these questions and answers have been\nasked.\nBut I think there's a more fundamental\npoint, Your Honor, which is the District Court, in\nawarding fees, found there was no whiff of State law\nclaims until the very -- very much the 11th hour in this\nclaim. And this is precisely why, Justice Sotomayor,\nback to your question, we really need district courts to\nhave discretion. If, as in this case -- we'll assume\nthere are State claims and Federal claims, but as the\nDistrict Court found, those State claims are deeply,\ndeeply buried in the weeds. That's precisely the case\nin once -- in which the District Court needs to have\ndiscretion to say -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I assume you\nagree that discretion can end up going either way? You\ncould submit time sheets that show 35 percent of our\ntime was spent on the Federal case, and the district\njudge can say, you know, time sheets are subject to -\nmanipulation is too strong a word, but I'm just not\ngoing to give you 35 percent; I'm going to give you 10\npercent. That's a reasonable exercise of discretion.\nThe judge doesn't have to say a whole lot about it and\nit's certainly going to be upheld on -- on appeal,\nright?\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and this\ngoes to the question of whether these standards are\nadministrable. The abuse of discretion standard in fee\nawards has worked and worked fairly well for the better\npart of three decades. The surest way to invite\nsatellite litigation over fees is to -- is to announce a\nrule in which you have to say, well, does it meet the\nbut-for test or does it not meet the but-for test? Or\nwith respect to even eligibility, to say, well, are they\nrelated or are they unrelated?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, every other\ncircuit except for the Sixth has dealt with the but-for\ntest or some variant of it. Even the Fifth did it in\nthis case and ruled in your favor.\nWhat you're asking for is, I think, very\nakin to the opposite rule of saying if we dismiss the\nFederal litigation, you're not entitled to any fees,\nbecause this case was about -- is in Federal Court, so\nthat's the only thing that matters. That seems to be\nyour rule. Every other circuit has some variant of\nbut-for, and they seem to manage it just fine. Nobody\nlikes attorney's fees.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthe -- I think the statement of the but-for test in\napplication will become very -- will be very close to\nthe test that we're espousing here, and here's why.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Espouse your test for\nme, because I still don't understand it except for\nflipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different\npredicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win,\nthey're entitled to fees.\nMR. STANCIL: The district court has\ndiscretion to award fees fairly attribute to the portion\nof the lawsuit that is declared frivolous. That's the\ntest. And here's why, in many cases, that's going to be\nsimilar to -- not identical, but similar to a but-for\ntest. Usually, you will push these claims\nsimultaneously, Federal claims and State claims\nsimultaneously, and so there will be a lot of things\nthat are -- that go in both directions.\nBut in this case, a special case where you\nhave -- Federal, Federal, Federal, that's all they said\nin District Court, this is -- and this is all over the\nrecord, where every time the case is described back and\nforth between counsel, after the moment of filing of the\ncomplaint until we get to the summary judgment\nproceeding 18 months later, everybody calls this a\nsection 1983 suit. And then at the last second, there\nis, oh, we have State law claims; let's go back to State\ncourt and litigate those. And where the District Court\ngrants the Petitioner's -- the plaintiff's request to go\nback to State court, that's the right time when you need\ndiscretion to be able to award what just happened.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you reconcile the\ntest that the Fifth Circuit said it was applying, which\nis -- seems to be a but-for test, with the fees that\nwere actually awarded here?\nMR. STANCIL: Because the only work done at\nthe time of the fee request was on a section 1983 claim,\nbecause the State law claims were not pursued. And that\nwas the finding of the District Court that says, these\nclaims were so deeply buried, you weren't even on\nnotice. Now, there's a difference.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that certainly\nconflicts with the first magistrate. The first\nmagistrate said use the material in the State for the\nState court proceeding.\nMR. STANCIL: Your Honor, I don't disagree\nthat there are questions and answers in these\ndepositions that will be used in State court,\nabsolutely. But there's a difference.\nWhat matters when a District Court is\nassessing fees and evaluating a fee request is, how was\nthe case litigated while it was an action or proceeding\nto enforce section 1983? Not how could the case have\nbeen litigated; not how if you had also pursued State\nlaw claims, would these things have been relevant. And\nonce these section 1983 claims, all of them, are out and\ndeclared frivolous, section 1988 ceases to operate in\nthe sense that it's no longer an action or proceeding to\nenforce section 1983.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question I\nasked Mr. Rosenkranz?\nHere, the argument seems to proceed on the\nassumption that the State law claims are not frivolous\nand may well be meritorious, but suppose that the\nFederal Court was in no position to make that\ndetermination at the time of the remand. What is the\nFederal Court to do then?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, there are several\noptions, and I would be remiss if I didn't specify that\nthose State law claims will be hotly contested when they\ngo to trial next month, and I don't want to leave any\nmisimpression on that. But the District Court has a\nseries of options.\nFirst of all, if the cases -- if the claims\nare going back to State court, the party does have to\nfile the motion for attorney's fees under rule 54. You\nhave -- you have to go in and say, if you're -- if\nthere's a judgment being entered, we want our fees. The\nDistrict Court could stay the request, defer it until\nthe State court rules on the State law claims. Those\nrequests were not made here.\nSo the District Court has lots of options.\nBut where -- particularly where the plaintiff desires to\ngo back to State court and the Federal case is coming to\nan end, the District Court must have the discretion to\nenter a fee award at that time. And in fact, that has\nbeen the case, and it's specifically mentioned in the\nHouse report to section 1988. The interim fee awards,\nwhere there's an order that disposes of substantial\nrights, are permitted. And again, this is why you want\ndiscretion in the hands of the District Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to us decide this\ncase on the basis that it was only -- it was only a 1983\nclaim for the entire time it was in Federal Court until\nthe -- until the very end, right?\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and that\nit was not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what good does that\ndo? I mean, is that why we took this case?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, we -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What principle of law\nthat's going to help the lower Federal courts would come\nout of that holding?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever you have nothing\nbut a 1983 case, you can give -- and it's frivolous, you\ncan give attorney's fees right up to the limit of the\nfees expended, right?\nMR. STANCIL: I think if the Court could\nannounce the principle, that would helpful, which is, if\nthe fees are fairly attributable, within the District\nCourt's discretion, to the frivolous claim, they may be\nawarded, and then say \"in this case,\" because it was\nonly a 1983 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think nobody doubts\nthat, do they?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, Your Honor, the fees\nfairly attributable to a 1983 claim, Petitioner says\nthey have to be only attributable to a 1983 claim.\nThat's very much in dispute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, no, but you're saying\nthey were only attributable to a 1983 claim during all\nof this litigation except the very end.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and we\nwould be happy to win on that basis. The Fifth Circuit\nsaid it and there was a reason that it was not an abuse\nof discretion, an abuse of discretion for the District\nCourt to award them under these circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you disagree with\nthe statement in the -- in the Court of Appeals opinion\nabout, only for fees that can be distinctly traced?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. We think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your\nadversary to agree with that position. You'll need to\nswitch sides, right?\nMR. STANCIL: We almost did, Your Honor. It\nwould be -- it would be -- we win under either test,\nYour Honor, but I don't think that section 1988 is fully\nserved by litigation over whether something is in the\nbut-for clause -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument\nhas focused, in reference to the complaint and all that,\non the legal theories. Your friend has focused on the\nunderlying factual basis, and all the litigation -- all\nthe background work on the underlying factual basis, I\ndon't know why that can be fairly attributed only to the\n1983 claim.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, because only the 1983\nclaims were pressed. But -- but there's a -- I think, a\nfaulty premise in his position, which is that there are\nfacts over here and law over here. Questions that are\nspecific to section 1983, such as under color of law,\nmunicipal policy or custom are highly specialized, fact\nbound, mixed questions of law and fact.\nThe idea that when we're deposing somebody\non, say, Sheriff Vice or Chief Vice on his conduct in\noffice that we're just looking at what happened, and\nthat this is just a factual question, I think that's\ninaccurate.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what percentage of the\nwork done has actually been useful to you in defending\nthe State court claims, approximate?\nMR. STANCIL: I'm not in a position to\nanswer that, Your Honor, because I'm not representing\nthese parties in the State court, but I'll concede for\npurposes of today that some significant portion. I\nwouldn't put a number on it, but certainly the who, I -\nwho, what, when, where, why is relevant to both, but\nit's relevant to how it was prosecuted in front of the\ndistrict court.\nAnd again, I think we have to put ourselves\nback in the chair of the district court on the bench\nwhen that fee request comes in. Under Petitioner's rule\nif these claims had not been pressed in Federal court\nand they're going to be remanded at the plaintiff's\nrequest, the district court has to speculate, well, how\nis this all going to go in State court, how is this\ngoing to play out in practice? Are these claims going\nto be meritorious? Are they not going to be\nmeritorious? Are they -- how much of this is going to\ngo to that, and I think that's, frankly, not the\nburden -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's disembodying\nwhat -- we have a factual scenario here. Some of the\ndiscovery was spent in determining what happened with\nthe alleged racial slur. Investigating the facts of\nthat claim are certainly relevant to the State court\nproceeding.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor, and we\ndon't -- we don't contest that investigating the facts\nare relevant to both, but it has to be pressed in\nFederal court. It has to be during the action or\nproceeding to enforce section 1983.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure what that\nmeans, because if you're taking discovery on the State\nlaw issues, defamation, extortion, et cetera, you're\npressing it. At the point that the Federal action is\ndismissed you no longer can pursue that in Federal court\nto its conclusion.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, again, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then why would -- if you\nhave a bunch of different claims and the facts support\nsome of the State court actions, why should you be\nentitled to fees that you would have incurred in State\ncourt no matter what?\nMR. STANCIL: Because the district court\nhere, and in this case, and it may not be in many cases,\nbut in this case the district court found the complaint\ndid not sufficiently allege these State law causes of\naction to put the defendants on notice that a defense\nwould be required.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you -- are you\nseriously contending that the lawyer below didn't\nunderstand that the defamation and the extortion claims\nwere part of this case? I'm hard pressed to believe\nthat reading that complaint would not doubt that -\nMR. STANCIL: Your -- Your Honor, that is\nprecisely what the district court said.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Found?\nMR. STANCIL: And again, it says, the court\nfinds that plaintiff failed to allege State tort law\nviolations in the complaint such that defendants were\nadequately noticed, that a separate defense as to these\nclaims would need to be prepared at the beginning of the\nlitigation. The record -- this is on -- that's on 32A\nof the petition appendix. It goes on to say, the record\nreflects that throughout the litigation the focus of\nboth plaintiff and defendant was plaintiff's section\n1983 claim. And if you look at the -- the\ncorrespondence between the parties, the summary judgment\npapers, it is 1983 from start to finish, until -- well,\nuntil the 11th hour. And in fact there's even a\nspecific statement in which the city, in an abundance of\ncaution says, just to be clear, there are no State law\nclaims here; and I think the district court is within\nits discretion. I would point the Court to the cases in\nwhich this Court has examined the standard of review for\nrule 11 decisions, and the Court has held in Cooter &\nGell and in Pierce that we give district courts very,\nvery wide berth on these questions, precisely because\nthey're on the ground, they recognize what the -- what\nthe standards are for pleading who is going to be on\nnotice as to what, and this is a funny case in that\nregard. It's unusual in that these things were really\nput to the side and parked until the 11th hour.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In answer to Justice\nScalia's question, basically the only difference you\nhave with the -- with the Fifth Circuit is that you\nwould say fees fairly attributable to Federal claims as\nopposed to fees exclusively attributable to Federal\nclaims; is that correct?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your presumption\nwould be that if the fees are -- support both State and\nFederal claims, you're still entitled to fees?\nMR. STANCIL: But they have to be judged,\nand this is under the eighth of these Johnson factors,\nthey have to be judged in the context of the overall\nsuit or the overall action to enforce section 1983.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I still -- I don't\nunderstand what that means.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, if we were -- if we had\n-- if as Petitioner suggests, this really was just an\nadd-on claim, that it was a section 1983 claim, and by\nthe way, you know, here are my breach of contract\nclaims, and, you know, it may also be a taking; and\nnobody spent any time doing it and nobody spent a whole\nof lot of -- you know, worried about the taking claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want district courts\nto determine how important the 1983 claim was in\nrelationship to the State claim?\nMR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor; I think\n-- I think that's correct. And I think that's precisely\nthe point of Hensley; and again as this case comes\nbefore this Court, whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion in calculating its fee award, I frankly -- we\nsubmit that this -- the judgment should affirmed under\nany of these tests.\nIf the Court has no more questions. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rosenkranz, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI actually like Mr. Stancil's cake metaphor.\nWhat matters is not how big -- how much of the cake was\ndevoted to one claim versus another. What matters is\nhow much more energy it takes to bake this particular\nsliver of the cake. It is all the same energy. The\ncentral piece of Mr. Stancil's argument is that the\ndistrict court found that the focus was only on the\nFederal claims.\nThat is a misreading of that one sentence,\nand Mr. Stancil keeps eliding the one critical word of\nthat sentence, which was the district court said that\nthey were not on notice that they needed to separately\ndefend the State law claims. Our whole point is they\ndid not need to separately defend the State law claims.\nThe district court was all turned around about the need\nto do something separate.\nAnd the reason we can be sure that Justice\nSotomayor's reading of the complaint is the same as\neveryone else's is because the lawyers in this case, the\ndefense counsel, did realize that there were State law\nclaims. Their answers are rife with State law defenses,\nand I refer the Court to pages 50, 56, and 66 of the\njoint appendix. Each one of them has three separate\nreference to -- references to, if we are found liable\nunder State law.\nThe summary judgment motion to which Mr.\nStancil refers has a response, an opposition by the -\nby the defendants, in which they caption -- this is on\npage 122B -- the caption is \"State Law Claims Against\nthe Town of Vinton.\" Now, that's that earlier summary\njudgment motion, that wasn't the 11th hour.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the Fifth's Circuit's\nstatement -- if the Fifth Circuit's statement of the\ntest it was applying is correct, would you say that that\nis a discretionary determination? The district court\nshould have discretion in making the -- an\napportionment?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor,\nabsolutely. There's a huge amount of discretion. Once\nwe set the rule, then the hours expended, were they\nreasonable, the rates, were they reasonable. At what\npoint does the -- does the -- do the fees trigger,\nbecause it was unreasonable to delay, all of that is -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree an\nassessment of the relative significance of the frivolous\nand nonfrivolous claims would also be a factor that\nwould go into that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I do not agree, Your Honor,\nbecause if you are -- if the defendant is properly in\ncourt and properly being forced to do discovery, the\nrelative importance -- what was in their heads, what was\nmotivating them is irrelevant, unless of course apropos\nof the earlier question, what was going on was they\nreally ratcheted up because they lose sleep over Federal\nclaims more than over State claims.\nBut, you know, a slip and fall, if you layer\non top of it a 1983 claim, no one's losing more sleep\nover it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if there's a cap on the\nliability for the nonfrivolous claim but not -- maybe\ntreble damages on the frivolous claim?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I think that would be\nexceptional circumstance under which the district court\nwould be entitled to take into consideration something\nthat's quite a bit more extraordinary. And so I'm not\nadvocating an -- you know, hard and fast absolute rule,\njust a guideline of the sort that this Court routinely\nadopts. I mean, the notion that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was wondering kind\nof as a starting point, and I don't know why you would\nfight so vigorously against the verbal formulation\n\"fairly attributable.\" I assume most district courts,\nwhen they get it, they're going to start by looking at\nwhatever his affidavit, this is how much our fees were,\nand then if there's some reason, perhaps Mr. Stancil's\ncase, where everybody thinks it's a Federal that's all,\nor maybe not, then they can just go \"fairly\nattributable\" rather than but-for, which gives the\ndistrict court a lot more leeway and the sort of leeway\nwe have always held in this area they should have.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I -- I\nactually believe -- if I may answer the question, it is\nquite a bit easier to apply a but-for test and review it\non appeal than it is to apply a test that is just a\nmishmash of factors over, if which the stakes are high\nenough, and they will be under Mr. Stancil's rule, there\nis an enormous incentive to litigate to death.\nIf there are no further questions -- I thank\nthe Court for its attention.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
