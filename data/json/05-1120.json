        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Mr. Milkey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MILKEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf I may, I'd like to frame the merits very\nquickly and then turn immediately to standing. Although\nthe case before you arises in an important policy area,\nit turns on ordinary principles of statutory\ninterpretation and administrative law. EPA made a\ndecision based on two grounds, both of which constitute\nplain errors of law reviewable under any standard.\nEPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority\nover the emissions of the four substances at issue, even\nif they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare.\nThat legal conclusion fails as a matter of law.\nAs a fallback position, EPA declined to\nconsider if these substances are endangering public\nhealth and welfare, claiming its policy approach made\nmore sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in\nsection 1202 of the Clean Air Act. Although EPA\npossesses a good deal of discretion in applying the\nstatutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling\non impermissible grounds as it did here.\nWe are not asking the Court to pass judgment\non the science of climate change or to order EPA to set\nemission standards. We simply want EPA to visit the\nrulemaking petition based upon permissible\nconsiderations.\nAnd now, Your Honor, I'd like to turn to\nstanding. Petitioner showed a wide variety of injury in\nfact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute\nwas aimed at preventing. For example, our uncontested\naffidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the\nmore greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more\ntemperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and\nthe seas rise. And of course as the seas expand, they\nrise everywhere around the world. Some areas such as\nMassachusetts will be hit particularly hard because\nwe're also subject to a land subsidence, but that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the standing\nrequires imminent harm. If you haven't been harmed\nalready, you have to show the harm is imminent. Is this\nharm imminent?\nMR. MILKEY: It is, Your Honor. We have\nshown that the sea levels are already occurring from the\ncurrent amounts of greenhouse gases in the air, and that\nmeans it is only going to get worse as the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When? I mean, when is the\npredicted cataclysm?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, it's not so much a\ncataclysm as ongoing harm. The harm does not suddenly\nspring up in the year 2100, it plays out continuously\nover time. And even to the extent you focus on harms\nthat occur in the future, there's nothing conjectural\nabout that. Once these gases are emitted into the area,\nand they stay a long time, the laws of physics take\nover.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's a lot of\nconjecture about whether -- I gather that there's\nsomething of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus\non how much of that is attributable to human activity.\nAnd I gather that -- what is it? Something like seven\npercent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are\nattributable to automobiles in the United States?\nMR. MILKEY: It's actually about 6 percent,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 6 percent? Thank you.\nMR. MILKEY: But it's important to point out\nas well, though, that in the ruling we challenge, EPA\nhas disavowed authority over all U.S. sources of\nemissions, which constitute about 20 percent of\nglobal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that doesn't go to\nthe harm that you're claiming. I mean, we're talking\nabout the, you know, the standing issue right now. And\nif you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of\ncarbon dioxide emissions, right?\nMR. MILKEY: Agreed, Your Honor. But my\npoint was that they disclaimed authority over all\nsources of carbon --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but that has\nnothing to do with whether you have standing. That has\nto do with the merits of the case. But on the standing\npoint, only new cars would be affected, right? So even\nthe reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. MILKEY: It would take a few years, Your\nHonor, but it is a basic premise of the Clean Air Act\nthat vehicle fleets regularly turn over --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But it goes\nto how imminent the harm is and how remediable the\nimminent harm is. If, in fact, the 6 percent will only\nbe reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few\nyears, your --\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, we have shown in\nthe record that a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide\nfrom cars is currently feasible. And since those\nemissions account for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not in the first year.\nMR. MILKEY: No, no. We agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean ultimately, when all\nthe cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars\nwith, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce\nthe carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent\nwould be the figure.\nMR. MILKEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But whatever position\nholds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power\nplants, and has there been any application to EPA with\nrespect to carbon dioxide in power plants?\nMR. MILKEY: There has, Your Honor. In\nfact, EPA has turned down a rulemaking petition to\nregulate them under the new source performance standard\nsection of the Clean Air Act, and that is currently on\nappeal in the D.C. Circuit, but it is currently stayed\npending the outcome of this case, and it just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you get the\nbenefit of that broader allegation in establishing your\nstandard? In other words, if you've challenged EPA's\nrefusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse\nregulation to a particular model of car, can you say,\nwell, they're following the same approach to a coal\npowered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to\nestablish a broader injury? Or, aren't you limited to\nthe specific legal challenge you're raising here?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I think it's\nactually more direct in the sense that in the decision\nwe challenge here, they said greenhouse gases are not\nair pollutants under any regulatory provision of the\nact. So at least on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have to\nshow injury from their decision here? The fact that\nother people, or you presumably as well might be injured\nby their decisions that you are not challenging here,\nthat doesn't help your standing here, does it?\nMR. MILKEY: I believe it does, Your Honor,\nbecause we cannot win that other case unless we win this\ncase here in terms of the authority question. And in\nany event, it is important to point out that because of\nthe scale of the problem, relatively small percentage\ndeductions in global emissions can lead to real world\nresults.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But at the outset, you\nmade this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement\nthat we need not decide about global warming in this\ncase. But don't we have to do that in order to decide\nthe standing argument, because there's no injury if\nthere's not global warming? Or, can you show standing\nsimply because there is a likelihood that the perceived\nwould show that there's an injury?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, especially in this\ncase where none of our affidavits were challenged, I\ndon't think the Court needs to go there ultimately on\nthe merits because we showed through our uncontested\naffidavits that these harms will occur. There was no\nevidence put in to the contrary, and I would add that\nthe reports on which EPA itself relies conclude that\nclimate change is occurring in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those affidavits\ntalked about the fact that if the government starts to\nregulate, the technology is going to change, if the\ntechnology changes, other governments will adopt it, and\nall that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out\nconjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved\nof.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, although we believe\nwe have shown other governments will follow suit, we are\nnot in any sense relying on that. We can easily show\nour standing without relying on that. And that's\nbecause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same argument if the\nautomobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?\nMR. MILKEY: It would be the same argument.\nAnd I would add that EPA in other contexts has\ndetermined on several occasions that a 1 percent\ncontribution is significant under the Clean Air Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\nconsistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the\nargument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to\nchallenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter\nsimply because his contribution, the benefit that he's\nclaiming is so small and so widely dispersed?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, it is different\nbecause here there is particularized injury that we have\nshown. The injury doesn't get any more particular than\nstates losing 200 miles of coastline, both sovereign\nterritory and property we actually own, to rising seas.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you look ahead, I don't\nknow how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but\nlet's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what\nparticularized harm does the record show that\nMassachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of\nsuffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that\nyou want to produce through these regulations?\nMR. MILKEY: Well, Your Honor, if I can deal\nwith the traceability part of that question first,\ntraceability is easy to show here because the extent of\nour harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in\nthe air. And being focused on the 20 percent of all\nU.S. sources, or the 6 percent of the cars, that's still\na sizeable portion of the problem, so we know that 6 or\n20 percent is there.\nIn terms of the particular harms, similarly\nwe have shown --\nJUSTICE ALITO: 6 percent is the total\nemissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in\nthe United States, right?\nMR. MILKEY: To the global carbon dioxide\nemission.\nJUSTICE ALITO: To the global. And so, the\nreduction that you could achieve under the best of\ncircumstances with these regulations would be a small\nportion of that, would it not?\nMR. MILKEY: It would be, we have shown in\nthe record it would be about a two-and-a-half percent\nover the time it takes to turn the fleet over. But it's\nimportant that given the nature of the harms, even small\nreductions can be significant. For example, if we're\nable to save only a small fraction of the hundreds of\nmillions of dollars that Massachusetts parks agencies\nare projected to lose, that reduction is itself\nsignificant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That assumes\neverything else is going to remain constant, though,\nright? It assumes there isn't going to be a greater\ncontribution of greenhouse gases from economic\ndevelopment in China and other places that's going to\ndisplace whatever marginal benefit you get here.\nMR. MILKEY: Yes, Your Honor. But reducing\ndomestic emissions will reduce our harm, the harm we\nwould otherwise face regardless of what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not if your harm is\nthe alleged loss of coastline. Not necessarily. It\ndepends upon what happens across the globe with respect\nto greenhouse emissions.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, we would still lose\ncoastline but we would not lose as much because these\nharms are cumulative, and while reducing U.S. emissions\nwill not eliminate all the harm we face, it can reduce\nthe harm that these emissions are causing.\nSo it will necessarily reduce our harm and\nsatisfy redressibility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, do we know that\nthat's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of\ntwo-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two\nand a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of\nyour coastline? Is that how it works? I'm not a\nscientist, but I'd be surprised if it was so rigid.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I don't believe\nit's established it's necessarily a straight line. But\nI want to emphasize that small vertical rises cause a\nlarge loss of horizontal land. For example, where the\nslope is less than 2 percent, which is true of much of\nthe Massachusetts coastline, every foot rise will create\na loss of more than 50 feet of horizontal land. And for\nexample, in the State of New York, the Oppenheimer\naffidavit projects that New York could well lose\nthousands of acres of its sovereign territory by the\nyear 2020. So the harm is already occurring. It is\nongoing and it will happen well into the future.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your\nstrongest case from this Court to support your standing\nallegation?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, what I would say to\nthat is our standing here is so much more direct and\nparticularized than, for example, the harm this Court\nfound sufficient in Laidlaw, which was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Laidlaw was a\nspecific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?\nMR. MILKEY: It was, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So doesn't that make\nit somewhat analytically distinct from this case?\nMR. MILKEY: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nHere I think the fact that the States are showing harm\nnot only to them in a property sense, but in their\nsovereign capacity --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your authority for\nthat? I have the same question as the Chief Justice. I\nwas looking at your brief for the strongest case.\nSuppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of\ncoastline. Would he have the same standing that you do\nor do you have some special standing as a State, and if\nso what is the case which would demonstrate that?\nMR. MILKEY: Well, Your Honor, first of all,\nwe agree that a large landowner would himself or herself\nhave --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What of a small landowner?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I'm asking\nwhether you have some special standing --\nMR. MILKEY: Yes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as a State and, if so,\nwhat's the authority for that?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, first of all, I do\nthink we have special standing. For example, here it's\nuncontested that greenhouse gases are going to make\nozone problems worse, which makes it harder for us to\ncomply with our existing Clean Air Act responsibilities.\nAnd the -- in the West Virginia case, which\nis a D.C. Circuit case, the Court found that that itself\nprovided an independent source of standing. In terms of\nSupreme Court cases, the -- it's been -- for 200 years,\nthis Court has recognized loss of state sovereign\nproperty as a traditional --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know. 1907\nwas Georgia versus Tennessee Copper, and that was\npre-Massachusetts versus Mellon. That seems to me your\nbest case.\nWhat about a small landowner? I asked the\nquestion about a big landowner. Suppose you have a\nsmall landowner and he owned a lot?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I think if someone\nis losing property because of this problem, then that\nperson would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de\nminimis threshold here. We have shown we own property,\n200 miles of coastline which we're losing, and we think\nthe standing is straightforward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not sure -- I think\nour opinions have even said it, but certainly\ncommentators have often said it, that really the far\nmargin of our standing cases has been, you know, the\nfamous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the\nadded pollution from municipal incineration of municipal\nwaste which would -- which couldn't be transported by\nrail for burial because the ICC rates were too high,\nthat added pollution interfered with the students' --\nthey were Georgetown Law students -- their hiking in the\nGeorge Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge.\nThat seems to me a much more immediate kind\nof damage; yet that's been referred to as really the far\nmargin of our standing cases. You're talking not about\ntheir being affected by ambient air but being affected\nby a stratospheric effect which then has another\nconsequence that you allege.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, once these are\nemitted the laws of physics take over, so our harm is\nimminent in the sense that lighting a fuse on a bomb is\nimminent harm. It may take --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Milkey, does it make\na difference that you're not representing a group of law\nstudents, but a number of States who are claiming that\nthey are disarmed from regulating and that the\nregulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal\nGovernment and the Federal Government isn't exercising\nit? I thought you had a discrete claim based on the\nsovereignty of States and their inability to regulate\ndependent on the law Congress passed that gives that\nauthority to the EPA. I thought that was --\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, you are correct\nthat we are saying that provides us also an independent\nsource of our standing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand\nthat. You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts\nState action? You can complain about the implementation\nof that law because it has preempted your State action?\nIs that the basis of standing you're alleging?\nMR. MILKEY: In short, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any case that\nhas ever held that?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I would cite you to\nthe amicus brief of the State of Arizona et al., which\ncites several cases, albeit not in this Court, that\nstand for that principle.\nYour Honor, if I may turn to the merits\nquickly, section 202(a)(1) provides EPA jurisdiction\nover any air pollutant that motor vehicles emit. It's\nnot restricted to certain types of air pollutants or to\nair pollutants that cause certain kinds of harm. And\nnot only does the act define air pollutant with\ncomprehensive breadth, but we know these four substances\nare air pollutants from other evidence.\nFor example, Congress itself expressly\nreferred to carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in\nsection 103(g). And since by definition all air\npollutants are air pollution agents, we know that\nCongress understood carbon dioxide to be an agent of air\npollution. And if air pollution --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Moving from your\nauthority argument to the exercise of authority, the\nclause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards\nwhich in their judgment cause or contribute to air\npollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public\nhealth. And they say they haven't made that judgment\nyet, so they're not in violation of that statutory\ncommand.\nMR. MILKEY: That is correct, Your Honor;\nbut they have said that they have put off making a\njudgment based on impermissible grounds. While EPA's\nexplanation is difficult even to follow, one overarching\npoint shines through and that is the agency does not\nagree with taking a regulatory approach regardless of\nhow it might otherwise come out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say the first\nday this law is passed, there are a lot of air\npollutants that come out of motor vehicles. I mean, is\nEPA immediately in violation of this statute if they\ndon't issue emissions regulations for every one those\nair pollutants on day one?\nMR. MILKEY: No, Your Honor. EPA has a lot\nof room to move based both on the endangerment standard\nitself and on background principles of administrative\nlaw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably the\nprinciple that they want to deal with what they regard\nas the more serious threats sooner. They want to deal\nwith lead first and then they want to deal with other\nstuff. I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I\nguess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not\nexercising a judgment with respect to a particular\npollutant?\nMR. MILKEY: The answer to that, Your Honor,\nis that when they do not rely on any of those grounds,\nthey do not rely on lack of information, they did not\nrely on background principles of administrative law.\nWhat though said here is -- and -- that they did not, in\nfact, contest the seriousness of the problem. But note,\nin two back to back sentences on page A-82 of the third\npetition they say: We must address the, issue but we\ndisagree with the regulatory approach.\nThe very section in which they explained why\nthey weren't going to regulate is entitled \"Different\nPolicy Approach.\" Rejecting mandatory motor vehicle\nregulation as a bad idea is simply not a policy choice\nthat Congress left to EPA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you are right and\nthen it went back and the EPA then said, well, an\nobvious reason also is constraint on our own resources,\nwe have the authority to say what comes first, Congress\n-- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has\nauthorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though\nwe have the authority to do this, we think that we\nshould spend our resources on other things.\nSuppose they said that? You said they\ndidn't say it this time around, but how far will you get\nif all that's going to happen is it goes back and then\nEPA says our resources are constrained and we're not\ngoing to spend the money?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, while background\nadministrative law principles provide EPA at least some\nroom to move, we think it's important that EPA say that.\nIf they -- it's a very different opinion if they say, we\nare not going to regular here because we just don't want\nto spend the resources on this problem and we want to\nlook elsewhere.\nIf they want to say that, they can say that\nand then, if at all, there'd be a narrow arbitrary and\ncapricious challenge on that. But the point is here\nthey relied on the impermissible consideration that they\nsimply disagreed with the policy behind the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not all they\nsaid. I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing\nemissions now would require EPA to make scientific and\ntechnical judgments without the benefit of studies that\nare being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the\narea. That's different than saying they disagree with\nthe regulatory approach.\nMR. MILKEY: It is and it isn't, Your Honor,\nbecause that statement will alleges be true. There will\nalways be scientific uncertainty. Agencies will always\nhave an understandable interest in seeing more\ninformation. They never --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a difference\nbetween the scientific status of the harm from lead\nemissions from vehicles that -- when you have lead in\nthe gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific\nknowledge with respect to the impact on global warming\ntoday? Those are two very different levels of\nuncertainty.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, when EPA regulated\nlead back in the ethyl days, as the Court court itself\ntook note, there were huge amounts of uncertainty at\nthat time. And EPA has a lot of discretion in\nevaluating that, that uncertainty.\nAnd if the EPA determined that the level of\nuncertainty was such that it was not reasonable to\nanticipate endangerment, that is perfectly appropriate.\nIt would also be appropriate if the agency determined\nthat there was so much uncertainty that they couldn't\neven form a judgment on that. That would be applying\nthe endangerment statute at the same time it put off.\nBut the point is they did not say any of that. They\ninstead relied on impermissible grounds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Milkey, I had -- my\nproblem is precisely on the impermissible grounds. To\nbe sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an\nair pollutant. If we fill this room with carbon\ndioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers\nhealth. But I always thought an air pollutant was\nsomething different from a stratospheric pollutant, and\nyour claim here is not that the pollution of what we\nnormally call \"air\" is endangering health. That isn't,\nthat isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant\nleaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is\ncontributing to global warming.\nMR. MILKEY: Respectfully, Your Honor, it is\nnot the stratosphere. It's the troposphere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Troposphere, whatever. I\ntold you before I'm not a scientist.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's why I don't want to\nhave to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.\nMR. MILKEY: Under the express words of the\nstatute -- and this is 302(g) -- for something to be an\nair pollutant it has to be emitted into the ambient air\nor otherwise entered there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and I agree with that.\nIt is when it comes out an air pollutant. But is it an\nair pollutant that endangers health? I think it has to\nendanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this\ndoes not endanger health by reason of polluting the air\nat all.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, respectfully, I\ndisagree, and there is nothing in the act that actually\nrequires the harm to occur in the ambient air. In fact,\nsome of the harm here does occur there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it talks about air\npollution all the time. That's what the, that's what\nthe thing is about, air pollution. It's not about\nglobal warming and it's not about the troposphere.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, we are not saying,\nfirst of all that global warming is air pollution, any\nmore than we're saying that asthma is air pollution.\nThey're both effects. I would point you to the example\nof acid rain, where the pollutant there, sulfur dioxide,\nthe problem is it causes its harm after it leaves the\nair, after it gets washed out. Air pollutants do not\nneed to cause harm in the ambient air.\nYour Honor, I would add that our\ninterpretation satisfies common sense because, while EPA\nhas plenary authority over substances that motor\nvehicles emit, those substances are regulated only if\nEPA determines that they cause endangerment. By\ndefining the term \"air pollutant\" comprehensively,\nCongress has not prejudged what may cause endangerment,\nbut it has allowed other pollutants to be regulated as\ntheir harms become appreciated. It is EPA's\ninterpretation that fails the common sense test. They\nhave suggested that the term \"air pollutant agent\"\ncreates an independent test so important that it may\nprevent some harmful compounds from being regulated\nwithout providing any hint of what the term means or how\nit applies in this case. And they cannot explain any\nnumber of anomalies such as the fact that methane is\nalready a regulated air pollutant, yet they claim they\ncan't look at its climate effects.\nYour Honor, if there are no more questions\nI'd like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Milkey.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nAfter carefully considering the issue the\nnation's expert agency in environmental matters\nconcluded that Congress has not authorized it to embark\non the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address\nglobal climate change. And that even if it has, now is\nnot the time to exercise such authority, in light of the\nsubstantial scientific uncertainty surrounding global\nclimate change and the ongoing studies designed to\naddress those uncertainties. Plaintiffs have provide no\nreason to override that quintessential administrative\njudgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, doesn't the\nEPA's decision on the first, \"we don't have any\nauthority,\" doesn't that infect its subsequent decision,\n\"well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it.\" But\nthey've already decided they don't have authority.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't think that\nit does. In the sense, I think EPA made clear in its\ndecisional document that it considered as an alternative\nmatter, that if it, even assuming it did have the\nauthority, that it wouldn't be appropriate to exercise\nit at this time.\nAnd importantly, too, I mean, just to be\nclear on this, EPA has never made an endangerment\nfinding with respect to global climate change. That was\ntrue in 1998 and 1999 when the agency had a different\nposition on authority to regulate. Even then the\nagency's position was clear. Even assuming we have the\nauthority, now is not the time to exercise it. So I\ndon't think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I take it that on that\nquestion, is there authority, the EPA has come out one\nway, but at least it is debatable because as you just\nsaid, the predecessors of the current people said we do\nhave the authority.\nMR. GARRE: Well, to that degree, Your\nHonor, this Court has made clear, for example, in the\nBrand X case that even where agencies change positions,\nwhere they've provided reasonable grounds for a new\ninterpretation, that interpretation is entitled to\nChevron deference. We think that that is true in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On this particular issue,\nthe opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32\npages. Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with\nwhether they have statutory authority. And of the 10\nthat deal with the issue we're talking about now, five\nof them give as their reason that they think that the\nPresident has a different policy. Of the remaining\nfive, two more consider international aspects of the\nproblem and how you have to get other countries to\ncooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in\nlight of these considerations, we decide not to exercise\nour power.\nNow their claim with respect to that, is\nthat at least three of the four considerations are not\nproper things for the agency to take into account:\nnamely whether the President wants to do something\ndifferent, whether we're running foreign policy\nproperly, whether cooperation with other countries are\nrelevant to this particular issue.\nSo what they've asked us to do is send it\nback so they can get the right reasons. Now -- if they\nwant not to do it. What's your response to that?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, I don't think\nthat it depends on how many pages that the agency\ndevoted to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason it depended on\nthat is whether or not these other, improper\nconsiderations might have influenced the ultimate\ndecision not to go ahead.\nMR. GARRE: I think it depends on the\nreasons that the agency gave. And one of the reasons\nthat the agency gave was the substantial scientific\nuncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate\nchange. Petitioners acknowledge that that was an\nappropriate consideration for the agency. So even if\nyou think the other considerations were inappropriate,\nand we certainly do not, but even if you think they are,\nthe agency gave an appropriate reason. And that reasons\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: When I write an opinion --\nwhen I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words:\n\"We decide this matter in light of the following three\nfactors taken together.\" And I guess a lawyer who said,\n\"one of those factors alone the Court has held justified\nthe result all by itself\" -- in saying the Court has\nheld that, I guess that wouldn't be so. That would be a\nbad lawyer, wouldn't it?\nMR. GARRE: But Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they write that all of\nthese considerations justify our result, again, one of\nthem by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have\nbeen sufficient.\nMR. GARRE: I -- I don't think that that is\na fair reading of the EPA decisional document, Your\nHonor. Certainly, the agency didn't go out of its way\nto say, \"and reading these considerations together and\nnot any of them individually.\" And with respect to the\nscientific uncertainty, Your Honor, you also have to\ntake into account that the EPA had before it and pointed\nto the report of the National Research Council on global\nclimate change.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I find it interesting that\nthe scientists whose worked on that report said there\nwere a good many omissions that would have indicated\nthat there wasn't nearly the uncertainty that the agency\ndescribed.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, if you are referring\nto the amicus brief, Your Honor, there are -- assuming\nthere are amicus briefs on the other side. The Ballunas\namicus brief -- I think it is fair for the Court to look\nat, to look at the document that the agency had before\nit. That -- that document produced by the National\nResearch -- Research Council, that's the research arm of\nthe National Academy of Sciences. And it's one of the\ngold standards of research.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in their selective\nquotations, they left out parts that indicated there was\nfar less uncertainty than the agency purported to find.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think one\nthing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is\nthat there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of\nglobal climate change. I think the debate is on which\nareas are more uncertain than the others. But certainly\nI think the agency was entitled to conclude,\nparticularly if you take into account the deference this\nCourt should give to that kind of determination, that\nthe scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of\nglobal climate change, surrounding issues of the extent\nof natural variability in climate, surrounding the\nissues of impact of climate feedbacks like ocean\ncirculation, and low cloud cover, are permissible\nconsiderations for the agency to take into -- -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there uncertainty on\nthe basic proposition that these greenhouse gases\ncontribute to global warming.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, the report says that\nit is likely that there is a -- a connection, but that\nit cannot unequivocally be established. I think that --\nif I could use that to go back to the standing question,\nYour Honor, which is the fundamental question of whether\nthey've showed not just a connection between greenhouse\ngas emissions in toto and the phenomenon of global\nclimate change, but the particular class of greenhouse\ngas emissions at issue in this case. Six percent of\nglobal greenhouse gas emissions, at most. That assumes\nyou put all U.S. vehicles off the road or that they are\nall zero emission cars. So you're talking about\nemissions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it is not a\nmathematical question, right? I mean, you would -- it's\nthat you would -- what is the number? What's enough?\n10 percent? 15 percent? Presumably, there's more to it\nthan the percentage of emissions attributable to be this\nparticular --\nMR. GARRE: I think that's true, Your Honor.\nBut what petitioners here to show, they bear the burden\nin order to establish standing under this case, is that\nregulation of the class of greenhouse gases at issue in\nthis case will make a difference to them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it is not\ngreenhouse gas. Suppose it was Agent Orange. Suppose\nthere a car is coming down the street and it sprays out\nAgent Orange. And I come into the Court and I say, you\nknow, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with\ncancer. And the reply is, well, we have some scientists\nhere who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent\nOrange is only 1 in 30. Maybe 1 in 50. Maybe 1 in a\nthousand. Maybe 1 in 10,000. And therefore, you have\nno standing to require the EPA to regulate this\npollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all\nover the city.\nNow, would you say that the person who's\nmade that claim has no standing?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that that is\na fundamentally different case, for the simple reason\nthat global climate change is a global phenomenon. I\nmean one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was only addressing,\nusing that to -- to address your problem that the\nchances are too small that, in fact, any one individual\nwill be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the\nmaterial that comes out of the truck -- the CO2.\nMR. GARRE: The -- the individual in that\ncase, Your Honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have\nto show specific facts demonstrating injury,\nredressibility and traceability. Now in this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your problem, I think, you\ntake the position, the proposition that the greater the\nharm the greater the risk, the smaller the probability\nhas to be before it is reasonable to act, and necessary\nto act.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, this Court's\nstanding cases make clear that you have to show that\ngranting the relief requested is likely to redress the\nalleged harms. And again, looking at the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They are saying it is\nlikely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point\nfor point percentage correlation between reduction of\ngas and coastline loss. You're saying, it seems to me,\nthat they have somehow got to pinpoint this\nmathematically --\nMR. GARRE: I don't -- we're not saying\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- before, before there is\nredressibility.\nMR. GARRE: We're not saying that, Your\nHonor. We're saying that they have, they certainly have\nto do more than they have done here. And they're\ngranted their standing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Tell me what it is that\nthey need, be more specific about what they need to do.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I will be more specific.\nAnd if I could also just point to what they grounded\ntheir case on here. They grounded their case on here,\nin the declarations, on the notion if the United States\nregulates greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, then\nother countries will follow suit with respect to the\nemissions of vehicles and other greenhouse gas\nemissions. That's clear from the McCracken declaration\non page 239, paragraph 32 of the JA, as well as the\nWalsh declaration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it can be argued\nthat the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that\nhere.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He has said that 6 percent\nis enough.\nMR. GARRE: That, that's true, Your Honor,\nbut I still think you have to look at the basis that\nthey've relied upon on standing. And they haven't shown\nspecific facts which should provide any comfort to this\nCourt that regulation of less than 6 percent or fewer\ngreenhouse emissions worldwide will have any effect on\ntheir alleged injuries.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is there -- why is\nthere reason to assume that it will have no effect?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That seems to be the\nassumption you're making. You are saying unless they\ncan pinpoint the correlation between reduction of gas\nand effect, let's say in coastline loss, they have not\nshown either causation or a sufficient likelihood of\nredressibility.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why do they have to\nshow a precise correlation as opposed simply to\nestablishing what I think is not really contested, that\nthere is a correlation between greenhouse gases and the\nkind of loss that they're talking about; and it is\nreasonable to suppose that some reduction in the gases\nwill result in some reduction in future loss.\nWhy is that insufficient?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Souter, one fundamental\nreason is that we don't know what the rest of the world\nis going to do, whether or not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume the rest --\nlet's assume that the rest of the world does nothing. I\ndon't think that's a very reasonable assumption, but\nlet's make that assumption. So that the only thing\nwe're talking is the 6 percent. If the 6 percent can be\nreduced -- I think the suggestion was over a reasonable\nperiod of time, by two and a half percent of the 6,\nthere is, I suppose, reason to expect that there will\nbe, maybe not two and a half percent less coastline\nlost, but some degree of less coastline lost because\nthere is a correlation between the gas and the loss of\nthe coastline. Why is that an unreasonable assumption\nto make in order to show causation and redressibility,\nbearing in mind that redressibility is a question of\nmore or less, not a question of either/or.\nThey don't have to show that it will stop\nglobal warming. Their point is that will reduce the\ndegree of global warming and likely reduce the degree of\nloss, if it is only by two and a half percent. What's\nwrong with that?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Souter, their burden is\nto show that if the Court grants their requested relief\nit will redress their injuries. I'm not aware --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Not redress their injury in\nthe sense that it will prevent any global warming or\nstop global warming and stop coastal erosion; their\nargument is a different one. It will reduce the degree\nof global warming and reduce the degree of coastal loss.\nMR. GARRE: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's their argument. Not\nall or nothing. But a part. That's what they're trying\nto show.\nMR. GARRE: And that's fine, Justice Souter,\nI grant you that. But they still have to show that\nthere is reason that it is likely to believe, that the\nreduction in that tiny fraction of United States\nemissions, putting aside the 99 percent or the 95\npercent in the rest of the world and what they do, and\nthe evidence that shows that greenhouse gas emissions in\nthose countries are increasing, they have to show the\nregulation of that tiny fraction would have an affect on\ntheir alleged injuries, not to completely redress them,\nYour Honor. We don't say that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't they have to show\nthat it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?\nMR. GARRE: They have to show that it is\nlikely, Your Honor. And they haven't even tried to make\nthat showing. The one thing that they've --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that showing -- and\nI agree with, by the way, with the Chief's suggestion a\nmoment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as\nto assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and\na half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a\nhalf percent reduction from the 6 percent.\nBut isn't it intuitively reasonable to\nsuppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse\ngases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing\ndamage or the ensuing climate change which causes the\ndamage? Isn't that fair?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think that it is fair,\nYour Honor. I don't want to pretend to be an expert on\nglobal climate change. But the one thing I can say is\nfrom the materials I looked at is that this an\nextraordinarily complex area of science. I'm not aware\nof any studies available that would suggest that the\nregulation of that minuscule fraction of greenhouse gas\nemissions would have any effect whatsoever on the\nglobal -- -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do you have any --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose others cooperate?\nSuppose, for example, they regulate this and before you\nknow it, they start to sequester carbon with the power\nplants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol\nmight be a good idea, and before you know it, they\ndecide any one of 15 things, each of which has an\nimpact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved. Now why\nis it unreasonable? Why is it unreasonable to go to an\nagency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent,\nand now we're going to go to a different agency like\nNHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going\nto go to your electricity regulation program, and coal.\nAnd there are like not a million things that have to be\ndone, maybe there are only seven. But by the time we\nget those seven things done, we'll make a big\ndifference. Now what is it in the law that says that\nsomehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want\nyou to do your part? Would you be up here saying the\nsame thing if we're trying to regulate child\npornography, and it turns out that anyone with a\ncomputer can get pornography elsewhere? I don't think\nso.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, what I would point\nyou to is your decision in Lujan versus Defenders of\nWildlife, Justice Kennedy's opinion in ASARCO versus\nKadish, where the Court made clear that you cannot\nestablish standing based on predictions of the actions\nof independent actors not before it. That's true about\nother agencies that aren't here today. That's true\nabout other countries whom this Court does not have\njurisdiction over.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they couldn't have gone\nin and asked for ozone regulations, because that\nrequires other countries? Or what about dumping heavy\nmetals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because\nof what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate\nthat. Acid rain they tried to regulate. You're\nsaying there is no standing to ask for any of that.\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, Congress has\nspecifically addressed two of the areas that you\nmentioned, Your Honor, and we're not saying that\ncategorically --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just because there's\nno standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't\nmean the agency can't regulate that particular area,\nright?\nMR. GARRE: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor. That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you are saying if\nCongress passes a statute and they put the words CO2\nright in this statute under ambient air, and they say\nanybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're\nsaying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do\nthat, because it's Article III we're talking about?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, we're saying\ntwo things. First, every plaintiff has the obligation\nto establish that he has Article III standing under this\nConstitution. And secondly, there are members of this\nCourt, for example, Justice Kennedy in his concurring\nopinion in Defenders of Wildlife, who did suggest that\nperhaps if Congress specifically addresses an issue,\nthat could inform the standing analysis. For example --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can't\ncompromise the requirements of Article III.\nMR. GARRE: It cannot, Your Honor. Congress\ncould make findings with respect to causation or other\nissues that this Court would have to give deference to\nand seriously consider, but you're right. It would not\noverride the requirements of Article III. And there may\nbe some global phenomenon that create more difficult\nchallenges to establish standing but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand the\ngovernment's position, you're not merely questioning\nstanding but you also take the position you do not have\nthe authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do;\nis that correct?\nMR. GARRE: That's true, Your Honor, moving\nto the merits, that's true. And with respect to that,\nthe agency engaged in the same type of analysis that\nthis Court laid out in the Brown and Williamson case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that\nquestion, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201,\nthere's reference to \"shall regulate\" if in the judgment\nof the administrator there is a for real danger and so\nforth. In your view, is there a duty to make a\njudgment?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, our view is that\nagencies have inherent discretion to determine when to\nmake that judgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could they have a\ndiscretion never to make the judgment?\nMR. GARRE: I think that gets to the\nquestion of whether there is, what judicial review is\navailable. We have assumed in this case that there's\nsome measure of judicial review. So I think at some\npoint you got to the point where the agency either has\nprovided no reasons whatsoever, or there is no sound\nbasis for the agency not to take that step. Then\nassuming that there is a role for the courts here, a\ncourt could come in and say that that was inappropriate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But as I read your brief,\nyou didn't really confront the question, s I understand\nit, of whether or not there was a duty to make a\njudgment at all. And I'm interested in what your\nposition on that is.\nMR. GARRE: Well, again, I think it goes to\nthe question -- we think the statute does not put a\ndeadline on when the agency has to have, and that\ntherefore --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To me, just reading the\ntext of the statute is a little ambiguous. I'm not\nentirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading\nthat statute, I got the impression that Congress thought\nthat the administrator had a duty to make a judgment\nwhen there was enough evidence out there that people\nwere concerned about it and so forth, that there would\nbe a duty there, but you think not?\nMR. GARRE: That's not the agency's\ninterpretation. In fact in its decisional document\nunder the section no mandatory duty, the agency explains\nwhy that's not its interpretation and we think that\nthat's a reasonable interpretation. Congress knows how\nto constrain the exercise of discretion. We point in\nfootnotes 18 and 19 of our brief of many examples where\nCongress has laid out deadlines or other constraints on\nthe exercise of discretion, and those aren't present in\nSection 203.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree that\nif they did make a judgment, then you would have\nauthority to regulate?\nMR. GARRE: That's right. And then I think\nit's a point the D.C. Circuit made in the Ethyl\nCorporation case at footnote 37, that precisely because\nthe statute imposes a duty to act once that endangerment\nfinding is made, the agency has discretion to determine\nwhen to make the endangerment finding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Norton versus Utah\nWilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of\noff-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was\nwhether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its\naction.\nMR. GARRE: That's a separate sort of\naction, Your Honor. There are cases where people have\nsaid that this is unreasonable delay. That's not the\nclaim that the petitioners in this case brought.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me understand\nyour answer to Justice Stevens' question. If EPA made\nthe judgment under the statute, you think they would\nhave had the authority?\nMR. GARRE: Under the statute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you had a\nBrown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.\nMR. GARRE: No, I was assuming -- in\nanswering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down\nin the exercise of discretion part. But you're right,\nYour Honor, the threshold position of the agency on this\nis that it lacks the authority to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about that? I\nfound persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in\nthe acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms\nhealth, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant\nafter it leaves the air and produces the acid rain. Is\nthere anything wrong with that response? It seems to\nme --\nMR. GARRE: I think there is, Your Honor.\nThe way that the agency looked at this is to look at the\nquestion of whether Congress intended it to regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions to address global climate\nchange, and it looked to the factors that this Court\nlaid out in Brown and Williamson. The statute as a\nwhole is specific legislation addressing global climate\nchange, and it concluded that the agency had not\nauthorized it to embark on that regulatory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You concede that it's an\nair pollutant that affects health?\nMR. GARRE: No. The agency -- what the\nagency found, Your Honor, was that because global\nclimate change is not air pollution within the meaning\nof the statute -- which is to say that Congress did not\nauthorize it to regulate it as air pollution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then why isn't it air\npollution within the meaning of the statute, although\nwhatever it is that causes acid rain is?\nMR. GARRE: I think, Your Honor, that the\nkey to the agency was that Congress did not give it\nregulatory authority over this. And I think on the\nquestion of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions\nqualify --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you can't give me any\ntext in this statute itself. It isn't the phrase \"air\npollution\" or any other phrase?\nMR. GARRE: The agency pointed to the term\n\"air pollution agent\" in the statute, and concluded that\nbecause global climate change was not air pollution that\nCongress intended to address --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that gets us back to\nacid rain.\nMR. GARRE: And with respect to acid rain,\nit's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a\nwhole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address\nacid rain.\nThe other thing I want to mention on the\ninterpretive question is, in the Brown and Williamson\ncase, this Court assumed at the outset of its analysis\nthat nicotine would be within the general terms of the\ndefinition of drug in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,\nand that cigarettes would fall within the general term\nof drug --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that's the position\nyou're taking, that it is within the general term?\nMR. GARRE: I think it's largely the\nposition that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it\nreasoned that, look, we've looked at everything. We\nconclude that Congress doesn't intend us to regulate\nglobal climate change as air pollution. And so\ntherefore, we're not going to say that greenhouse gases\nare air pollution agents.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is why there's a\nsignificant difference between the agency saying that\nfor 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in\nits opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the\nagency's position was. And here where it's a newly\nminted position, because the agency's position not too\nlong ago was that they did have the authority.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was\n30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in\n1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant. And\nagain, even when it reached that conclusion, it made\nclear that it didn't think that the agency would\nexercise its authority to regulate it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a different\nquestion. I'm just focusing on, did it have authority\nto deal with this issue?\nMR. GARRE: And I think -- I mean, I grant\nyou that there are differences between Brown and\nWilliamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion\nthat the agency reached is the same. Which was, to\nborrow the phrase from the Whitman case, Congress did\nnot intend to hide elephants in mouse holes. Here we\nare talking about an issue of the magnitude of\nregulating global climate change and greenhouse gas\nemissions, which are fundamentally an important part of\nthe nation's economy. Nearly 85 percent of the economy\nis a direct or indirect source of greenhouse gas\nemissions.\nAnd when we look at when Congress did\nmention carbon dioxide in the statute, which is in the\n1990 amendments, Section 103(g), that was the first time\nthat Congress mentioned CO2. And when it did that, it\nwent out of its way to say that it was giving\nnon-regulatory authority to the agency, and moreover,\nthat nothing in this section shall provide any basis for\nany air pollution control requirements. That's a\nstrange thing for Congress to say if it believed that\nthe agency already had this far-reaching authority to\nregulate greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere are other aspects of the statute that\nwe think lead to the same conclusion in Brown &\nWilliamson. There's a fundamental inconsistency, the\nagency concluded, between attempting to regulate\ngreenhouse gas emissions under the national air ambient\nquality system, and that inconsistency is similar to the\ninconsistency that the Court pointed out in the Brown\nand Williamson case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like you to address\nthat. You said there was a lot of legislation in\nCongress that would have been pretty inconsistent with\nserious regulation by the FDA. And in this case, I\ndon't think Congress is opposing the notion. I don't\nknow anybody there who's in favor of global warming.\nAnd it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is\nactually, that would be significantly interfered with by\nthe EPA trying to do its best to deal with this problem.\nOr am I wrong?\nMR. GARRE: I think you're wrong in the\nfollowing respect, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What articles would be --\nMR. GARRE: Congress has passed at least six\nseparate statutes to specifically address the issue of\nglobal warming, and all of them share two common\nfeatures. One, we want you to research this issue and\nlearn more about it. And two, we want you to work on an\ninternational framework for addressing global climate\nchange. The agency reasonably concluded that unilateral\nU.S. regulation of greenhouse gases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything in the\nstatute that prevents them from consulting with other\nnations or prevents the government from doing that when\nthey determine how best to work out whatever standards\nor other forms of regulation they want?\nMR. GARRE: There's nothing in the Clean Air\nAct, if that's the stature you're referring to, but I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I presume the problem that\nthey have in mind is that we have nothing to give in\ninternational negotiations. If we have done everything\nwe can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make\nwith foreign nations? What incentive do they have to go\nalong with us?\nMR. GARRE: That's right, Your Honor. We've\ngot a unique collective action problem, and yet, the\nreaction experience of the agency in dealing with the\nissue of stratospheric ozone depletion rate had\nprecisely that situation, where the U.S. initially took\nsteps. The stratospheric ozone depletion worsened, and\nit was only after international agreement was reached in\nthe Montreal Protocol that a global solution to the\nproblem was reached.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think they have a\ngood reason, yes or no? Because I'm not an expert in\nforeign affairs. The EPA probably is more than I am.\nBut do you think that if they do rest their decision on\ntheir analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper\nbasis for an agency like the EPA to refuse to regulate?\nMR. GARRE: I think it's a proper basis\nwithin its inherent discretion, Your Honor, for at least\ntwo reasons. One, the agency is a part of the executive\nbranch and it had unique experience with the issue of\nstratospheric ozone depletion. And two, Congress has\nmade clear, for example in the Global Climate Protection\nAct of 1987, that the EPA has a role in at least\nreporting to Congress on international cooperation and\nefforts in that realm.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But Congress has not\ndirected, don't regulate domestically for purposes of\nglobal warming.\nMR. GARRE: That's true, Your Honor, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I have\nwith your reference to this very -- these various pieces\nof legislation that suggest that Congress has a\ndifferent modus operandi in mind is that Congress\ncertainly is aware that EPA has authority over\npollutants, and it has never interfered with it.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, again, I think\nin looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the\nconclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently\nreached, is that Congress has not authorized it to\nembark on this regulatory endeavor. And I think the\nclosest statute that comes to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that a\nmisstatement? Isn't the conclusion that they're trying\nto draw that Congress doesn't want them to exercise the\nauthority they have for this purpose? And isn't that\nsomething quite different? And doesn't that raise the\nquestion whether that is a legitimate concern for them\nunder the statute that does give them the authority?\nMR. GARRE: May I answer the question? No,\nYour Honor. I think the agency's conclusion was\nCongress had not authorized it to undertake the\nregulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global\nclimate change and that, even if it had, that authority\nshould not be exercised.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\nMr. Milkey, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Milkey, do you want us\nto send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if\nonly the last two pages of their opinion were given as a\nreason that would suffice? Would that make you happy?\nMR. MILKEY: It would not make us happy,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, if I can address\nthe global aspect of the problem, the fact that the\nsolution to the whole problem --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your answer to\nJustice Scalia? Because I thought you said before that\nyou thought it was appropriate for us to send this case\nback so that they could redetermine in light of proper\nconsiderations whether they wanted to exercise their\nauthority.\nMR. MILKEY: That is exactly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I wrong about that?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, that is exactly\nwhat we want. I understood Justice Scalia to be saying\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I was asking,\nyes. And you think it will go back to them and they\nwill say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is\nnot enough by itself? You really expect that to happen?\nMR. MILKEY: Respectfully, Your Honor, I\nthink EPA will have a hard time saying that there is\ninsufficient -- I mean, too much scientific uncertainty.\nThe very sentence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They said it already.\nMR. MILKEY: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only question is\nwhether that alone is enough.\nMR. MILKEY: Respectfully, Your Honor, they\ndid not say that. They did not anywhere say why the\nexisting uncertainty mattered. To the contrary, they\nemphasized the need to act in the face of current\nuncertainty, but never explained why that principle\napplies to a nonregulatory approach but not to a\nregulatory one.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What they said was\nuntil more is understood about causes, extent and\nsignificance of climate change and the potential options\nfor addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to\nregulate these emissions.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That strikes me as\nsaying they think there is too much uncertainty for them\nto act.\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, they did not say\nthere is too much uncertainty for them to form a\njudgment, which is the key issue. They said they\npreferred more certainty, but because of the nature of\nthe endangerment standard, which emphasizes the\nimportant of regulating in the face of uncertainty, they\nhave to at least explain why the uncertainty matters.\nAnd that is -- what they did here is particularly\ntroubling in the fact that they ignored all of the\nindications pointing toward endangerment. They looked\nat what we don't know without ever looking at what we do\nknow.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the EPA concludes that\nregulating an air pollutant would endanger public health\nand welfare, can it decline to regulate?\nMR. MILKEY: Not under section 202, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It has to regulate even if\nit concludes that regulation would make things worse?\nMR. MILKEY: Would make things worse?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. MILKEY: I'm sorry, I didn't understand\nthat.\nNo.\nMR. MILKEY: No, Your Honor. If they\nthought there would be more endangerment that way they\nwould not have to regulate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then why can't they -- what\nis wrong with their view that for the United States to\nproceed unilaterally would make things worse and\ntherefore they're going to decline to regular for that\nreason?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, first of all, I\ndon't believe they actually said that, and there is\nnothing in the statute that even hints that they can\ntake foreign policy considerations into account. To the\ncontrary, the statute is very specific in other sections\nabout when they're supposed to look at foreign emissions\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the definition of\npublic welfare extremely broad?\nMR. MILKEY: Your Honor, it is certainly\nextremely broad, and it does include climate.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
