        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nRompilla against Beard.\nMr. Nolas.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NOLAS: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nProfound mitigating evidence concerning Mr.\nRompilla's life history was not heard by the capital\nsentencing jury in this case because his trial counsel did\nnot secure a single scrap of paper about his life history.\nAs to the trial prosecutor, his argument, what\nhe elicited from the defense witnesses, and what he\npresented affirmatively sent the message to this jury of\nfuture dangerousness.\nWhen the jury inquired whether in Pennsylvania\nthere is parole from a life sentence, they were not given\nthe simple, straight answer that Pennsylvania law clearly\nindicates, no. Instead, they were told -- instead, their\nquestion was not answered.\nWhat I would like to do, unless the Court has\nspecific inquiries, is to make certain points about the\nineffectiveness issue and then turn to the sentence issue.\nAs to the ineffectiveness issue, Your Honors,\nthis Court has made very clear in Williams v. Taylor, in\nWiggins v. Smith, reiterating the concept established\noriginally in Strickland v. Washington, that a trial\ndefense counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough\ninvestigation for mitigating evidence in a capital case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're asking us, I\nsuppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper\nrecords. We've seen a number of capital cases, you know\n-- as you know. This counsel seemed to me to be quite\narticulate and -- and had a very sound theory of -- to\nargue to the jury for mitigation. It didn't work, of\ncourse. I -- I just don't know what constitutional rule\nyou want to ask us for, that you have to look at record\nevidence?\nMR. NOLAS: We are not asking the Court to set a\nconstitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must\nobtain records in every capital case. We are asking this\nCourt to apply the rule articulated in Strickland v.\nWashington itself where the Court indicated that counsel\nhas a duty to make a reasonable investigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you had three forensic\nexperts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think\nthe papers were relevant either.\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. And as to the\nexperts themselves -- and that's actually -- the experts\nand the family are the core of respondent's argument\nagainst Mr. Simmons' claim.\nThe simplest answer is to look at Wiggins v.\nSmith where this Court held very clearly that the\nretention of mental health experts sheds no light on the\nreasonableness of counsel's life history investigation.\nThat is especially appropriate in this case because in\nthis case the counsel who had contact with the experts\ntestified very clearly at the post-conviction hearing that\nthe experts were never asked -- never asked -- to develop\nlife history mitigating evidence. And as my friend, Ms.\nZapp, indicates in her brief at page 43, there was no\ntactical decision in this case by counsel to not pursue\nlife history mitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, counsel -- counsel did\nmake use of several relatives of the defendant who\ntestified. I -- I think weren't there about four\nrelatives who testified?\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, including his son.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And he talked to all of them\nand talked to the defendant as well. So would a\nreasonable person think that's enough to find out family\nhistory and -- and the concerns that you had?\nMR. NOLAS: This Court made very clear in\nStrickland and Williams and in Wiggins that an assessment\nof counsel's representation must be done from counsel's\nperspective at the time. Counsel's perspective at the\ntime, as Ms. Dantos clearly testified at the hearing, was\nthat the family were not good sources of information for\npetitioner's life history. She gave three reasons for\nthat.\nShe said, number one, whenever life history was\npursued with them, they did not want to deal with it\nbecause they thought he was innocent.\nNumber two, whenever they were -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that seems to me an -\nan extraordinary non sequitur. I don't understand. They\ndidn't want to deal with it because they thought he was\ninnocent. I -- how does that make any sense?\nMR. NOLAS: That -- that's what she testified\nto, Your Honor. I'm not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What she testified to makes no\nsense.\nMR. NOLAS: She gave a second reason which was\nthat counsel, when they pursued life history mitigation,\nthe family would respond, we hardly know him. He was in\njuvenile facilities as a youth, and then he was in prison\nas an adult. We don't have any knowledge of his life\nhistory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the -- the portions of\nhis life history that -- that are the most appealing are\nthe portions from his youth, before he went into the -\ninto the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly\nwith him during that period.\nMR. NOLAS: And third and most significantly,\nJustice Scalia, she testified that they were not willing\nto provide life history mitigating -- facts about his life\nhistory because of, quote, whatever else was going on with\nthem, unquote. Or as Mr. Charles, the other attorney, put\nit, these were not the type of family that would provide\ninformation when asked.\nBear in mind, both of these counsel knew what\nthe respondent's post-conviction rebuttal psychologist\ntestified to, that when you're dealing with abuse,\nneglect, a dysfunctional home, people don't want to talk\nabout that. They want to withhold that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- let me take you back\nto the -- to the experts. You say he did not specifically\nask the experts to go -- to go into his childhood\nproblems. You know, I can imagine when the expert comes\non the stand, the first question being asked is, now, Mr.\nExpert, were you told by counsel to look into the\nchildhood problems? You know, as though counsel were\nplanting in the expert's mind what the expert should say.\nWhat would anyone who hires a psychologist or a\npsychiatrist -- what would anyone expect him to look into\nin -- in determining whether the person is -- is mentally\ninjured but -- but the childhood? Do you really think\ncounsel could not have expected with total assurance that\nthese people would do that?\nMR. NOLAS: Sure, because counsel themselves\ntestified to that at the post-conviction hearing and the\nexperts themselves said -- now, let me --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nolas?\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't it the case that those\nexperts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for\nmitigation purposes? They were hired in connection with\nthe possibility of a defense at the guilt stage, number\none, that he was insane at the time he committed the\ncrime, in which case what he was when he was a child would\nbe irrelevant, and number two, that he was presently\nincompetent to stand trial. So they were asked\nspecifically to inquire into his present mental situation,\nand their testimony was relevant to the guilt phase of the\ntrial. So that's the instruction. Naturally they -- what\n-- why are we engaging you? We're engaging you to tell us\ndo we have a basis for an insanity plea, do we have a\nbasis for an incompetent to stand trial plea.\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, and the -- the\nrespondents use the word mitigation that Ms. Dantos used\nin her testimony. I only ask the Court to look at the\njoint appendix at page 472 where Ms. Dantos says very\nclearly, I explained to them the purpose for my contacting\nthem, and the purpose was to initially see if there was\nany issue of mental infirmity or mental insanity for the\nguilt phase and subsequently to possibly use in mitigation\nany mental infirmity if it -- if the jury came back first\ndegree.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there any indication that\nafter the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing\nphase began -- I take it it was just a matter of hours or\nalmost days till the sentencing -- till the sentencing\nphase began. Was there any contact with the psychiatrists\nor with experts after the sentencing phase and the -\npardon me -- after the guilt phase and before the\nsentencing phase?\nMR. NOLAS: No, Your Honor. The record is very\nclear that the experts were asked, as Justice Ginsburg\nindicated, about mental infirmity at the time of the\noffense. They reported back that they could provide no\nassistance in that regard, and then there was not further\ncontact with them. They were also asked about competency,\nwhich is not at issue before the Court.\nThe -- the key thing to bear in mind is you can\nlook through Ms. Dantos' entire testimony and look -- you\ncould look through Mr. Charles' entire testimony at the\nhearing. Nowhere do they say we asked the experts to\ndevelop life history mitigating information. This isn't\nthe case where the lawyers say to the doctor, Doctor, I'm\nlooking into this man's life history, go investigate it.\nTell me what there is. Tell -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought what you just quoted\nsaid that they -- that they would intend it to be used in\nthe mitigating phase.\nMR. NOLAS: Mental infirmity at the time of the\noffense at the penalty phase, not life history mitigation,\nnot how did he do in school, was there abuse in the home,\nwas there neglect in the home, was their mistreatment in\nthe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't all that\nbear upon mental infirmity at the time of the offense?\nIsn't the reason that -- that one considers these factors\nmitigating is that they reduce the guilt at the time of\nthe offense? I -- I thought that that's the whole -\nMR. NOLAS: No, Your Honor. That is -- with all\ndue respect, that is too constricted a view of what -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we just let him off\nbecause we're -- we're sympathetic to his present state?\nI thought that mitigation means that it reduces the guilt\nof the offense at the time that he commits it.\nMR. NOLAS: It's -- it's not let him off, Your\nHonor. It's a -- a request to the jury, that was out for\nover 12 hours, that this man receive a life sentence.\nAnd you've already resolved this issue in\nWiggins v. Smith. In Wiggins v. Smith, counsel hired a\nmental health expert, provided that expert 200 pages of\nDSS records, provided a PSI, had the expert interview all\nof Mr. Wiggins' family members, had the expert report back\non, quote/unquote, mitigating evidence, and this Court\nfound that counsel had failed to provide reasonably\ndiligent effective assistance because counsel had not\ndeveloped life history mitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nolas, you haven't\nmentioned it, but didn't one of the three experts suggest\nthat there be a -- a follow-up inquiry into the -- the\nabuse of alcohol by the defendant?\nMR. NOLAS: Dr. Gross suggested that there be a\nfollow-up inquiry into -- into alcohol, and that -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My understanding is that\nnothing was done in response to that. Is that correct?\nMR. NOLAS: In response to that, the reasonable\nthing would be why did this man's parole records indicate\nthat he should abstain from alcohol. Let's look into his\nalcohol history.\nAnd to back to -- to your question, Justice -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which -- which you're saying\nthey did not do. I mean, just to get it -\nMR. NOLAS: They testified that what they did\nthey asked -- they asked the other experts to look into\nit.\nAnd bear in mind, all of the experts in this\ncase had less than the expert in Wiggins. All of the\nexperts in this case had less than the expert in Williams.\nWhat these lawyers gave the expert is a client that they\nthemselves said is not a reliable source of information, a\nclient who did not want to discuss his life history, a\nclient who misled counsel, a client who these lawyers said\nwe can't rely on -- on this fellow.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nolas, there were some\nrecords that the prosecution sought and used. Was it -\nthe records that were in the very courthouse.\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, and that was, I\nguess, the simplest way to respond to Justice Kennedy's\noriginal question, which is what is the duty that these\nlawyers have. Well, at its simplest, in Wiggins this\nCourt said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough\ninvestigation for mitigating evidence, a thorough\ninvestigation into the aggravation. The trial prosecutor\ntells these counsel, I'm going to use that information in\nthat file against your client.\nThe file was maintained in the same courthouse\nin which this case was tried. Counsel never goes and\nlooks at that file. When the prosecutor brings it to the\npenalty phase, they complain, we've never seen this file\nbefore. In that file -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What did the prosecution use?\nThe fact of early -- early conviction and the details of\nthe crime. Right?\nMR. NOLAS: And the transcript that's included\nof -- in that trial of the prior offense victim's\ntestimony.\nBut the thing is what if these lawyers what -\nwhat I -- I hope this Court would expect any lawyer to do\nwhen the prosecutor says, I'm going to use that folder\nagainst you. You go and you open up the folder.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And what would they have found?\nMR. NOLAS: They would have found achievement\ntest scores in that prior conviction case file indicating\nthat Mr. Rompilla had never progressed beyond the third\ngrade, indicating that he functions below 96 percent of\nthe population. He lived a nomadic life. He -- and -\nand test results indicating that he was elevated on scales\nfor schizophrenia, paranoia, neurosis, indicating that he\ngrew up in a slum environment, and that he was an\nalcoholic, bearing in mind Dr. Gross' original inquiry.\nThese are also lawyers who knew that Mr. Rompilla had a\njuvenile history and had a prior adult criminal history.\nAnd Pennsylvania lawyers know -- we've discussed\nthis in the brief -- that PSI records, presentence reports\nin Pennsylvania, and juvenile records are very special\nthings compared to such records in other States. In -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nolas, are you telling us\nthat all that information would have -- was in the file\nthat described the -- the criminal history that the\nprosecutor used in his case?\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they didn't even look at\nthat file?\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Justice Stevens, what I just\nread to you.\nNow, Pennsylvania lawyers -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is this the document that's on\nthe lodging at page 31-34?\nMR. NOLAS: If I may have Your Honor's\nindulgence for a moment. Yes, Your Honor.\nThat -- because in this case, that prior\nconviction court file contained records that were produced\nwhen Mr. Rompilla was evaluated for that prior conviction.\nOne point that I don't want to escape this\nCourt's attention is in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court and Pennsylvania -- the Pennsylvania\nstatutes indicate that presentence investigation reports\nand juvenile records have to contain information relating\nto, quote, educational history, psychological history,\nmarital history, family history, military history -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to adopt a\nconstitutional rule that at least in Pennsylvania counsel\nhave to consult these -- these records -\nMR. NOLAS: When -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- as a constitutional matter.\nMR. NOLAS: Justice Scalia, when State law tells\nyou that what you're going to find in juvenile and adult\nrecords is exactly what the ABA standards say capital\nlawyers should pursue, it's not diligent to ignore the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your answer is yes.\nMR. NOLAS: Yes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want a constitutional rule\nthat in Pennsylvania counsel must look into these records.\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, plus.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about a rule that says you\nmust consult the file of the case that's being used by the\nprosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance,\nat least where that file is readily available, and you\nmust follow up indications in that file that suggest a\nsignificant mitigating defense?\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. NOLAS: And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's nothing special to\nPennsylvania if you know that the prosecutor is going to\nuse a certain file.\nMR. NOLAS: The -- the only that's special to\nPennsylvania is what Pennsylvania law tells you you're\ngoing to find in those files. That makes it different\nthan, say, Georgia where there's no provision for having\nthat material in those files.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For what purpose did the\nprosecution use the files?\nMR. NOLAS: The prosecution told counsel I'm\ngoing to use these files as part of my case and eventually\nuse them for aggravation purposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Use them for -- he did use them\nfor aggravation.\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in what respect?\nMR. NOLAS: He put on -- he -- he had an\nassistant district attorney take the stand and read the\ntranscript of the victim's testimony in the prior case,\nwhich was included in that folder. He also used\ninformation about when Mr. Rompilla incarcerated, paroled,\net cetera that was reflected by that folder. So plainly\nthese lawyers knew that that trial was going to be used\nbecause the prosecutor told them.\nOne other factor on -- on the duty of the\ncounsel. These counsel testified that they knew that Mr.\nRompilla had problems in school and left school early.\nThe school administration building in Allentown is across\nthe street from the capital case courthouse. Ms. Zapp\nwill confirm this. It says school administration\nbuilding. You walk by it when you go into this\ncourthouse. They knew he had problems in school. They\nnever walked in there and asked somebody, let me look at\nthe file.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't like to either\ndirect your own argument or the questions from my\ncolleagues, but the Simmons issue here -\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me is important\nand -\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, I will turn to\nthat. I will to turn to that with more sentence on the\nineffective issue, and that sentence is that the\nrespondent's argument in this case misstates, with all due\nrespect to -- to my friend, Ms. Zapp -- misstates the\nholding of Wiggins. The respondent reads Wiggins as\nholding only that when counsel has a lead, counsel should\npursue a thorough life history investigation.\nI -- I think it's pretty clear these lawyers\nhere had leads, but even if they didn't, the holding of\nSimmons -- the first holding of Simmons is that counsel\nhas a duty to conduct a thorough life history mitigation\ninvestigation and cannot rely on rudimentary knowledge\nfrom a narrow set of sources. These counsel had less of a\nrudimentary knowledge than the counsel in Simmons because\nthey relied upon -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wiggins.\nMR. NOLAS: In Wiggins. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wiggins.\nMR. NOLAS: Because they relied upon what they\nthemselves knew was a remarkably set of sources, a family\nand a client who were not willing to discuss the\ninformation when they knew records were available that\nwould have discussed the life history.\nTurning to the Simmons issue, Justice Kennedy,\nthe core of the Simmons issue, the core debate before the\nCourt, is what does Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion\nin Simmons mean. The -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If there had been no questions\nfrom the jury, it seems to me that you wouldn't have had\nan argument at all because the counsel was allowed -- the\ncounsel was allowed to argue this to the jury and did\nargue it to the jury.\nMR. NOLAS: The -- the questions are very\nsignificant, Your Honor. My -- my instinct would be there\nwould be -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you agree\nthat but for the questions from the jury, Simmons was\ncomplied with? The counsel argued the point to the\njury -\nMR. NOLAS: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- without being -- without\nbeing contradicted.\nMR. NOLAS: Justice Kennedy, the caveat is that\nthe court instructed the jury that the arguments of\ncounsel are not evidence and that the law would come from\nthe court. And in that context, how much weight did they\ngive on the passing reference in Ms. Dantos' closing\nargument? You don't have to reach that issue in this case\nbecause we know what the jury was concerned about. They\nwere concerned about parole and they were concerned about\nthat because the prosecutor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. So now -- now we have a\nsituation where the case, by my suggestion in any event,\nwas properly presented to the jury, and the only question\nis what the constitutional obligation is once the jury\nbrings in a question.\nMR. NOLAS: The constitutional obligation under\nSimmons itself would be to say is there something here or\nin -- in the words of Justice O'Connor, did the State put\nfuture dangerousness in issue. And in this case -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it didn't expressly. I\nmean, there -- there were arguments about his behavior,\nbut the problem I think we have with the Simmons claim\nhere is that the Kelly case had not yet been decided, and\nyou now have the AEDPA situation of trying to show that\nthe State court's resolution was objectively unreasonable.\nAnd prior to Kelly, that's a pretty tough road for you.\nMR. NOLAS: And that may be -- that would have\nbeen the case, Your Honor, had the Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt not adopted the very interpretation of Your Honor's\nconcurrence in Simmons that Kelly adopted. The\nPennsylvania Supreme Court three times said Simmons means\nyou get a life without parole instruction in Pennsylvania\nwhen the State puts future dangerousness at issue. The\nconstruction that the respondent gives to Simmons and that\nthe court of appeals below gave to Simmons, specifically\nthat it only applies when the prosecutor argues that the\ndeath penalty should be imposed because of future\ndangerousness, not only is not to be found in Justice\nO'Connor's concurrence, but it is not to be found anywhere\nin the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's opinion in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the best argument\nyou have that future dangerousness was an issue?\nMR. NOLAS: There are several factors in that\nregard, Your Honor. As to the argument itself, the\nprosecutor called Mr. Rompilla a very strong individual, a\nvery violent individual. He asked the jury, isn't it\nfrightening the similarity between his past crime and this\ncrime? He sent the clear signal to the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that also\nbears on the -- on the fact of his depravity, that he was\njust -- he just didn't learn.\nMR. NOLAS: He -- he sent the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know if that's\nnecessarily future dangerousness or -- it's equally\nblameworthiness.\nMR. NOLAS: Justice Kennedy, he sent the clear\nsignal to the jury that this is a violent, frightening\nman, and then he tied it all together with this comment.\nAnd I think he learned a lesson from his prior -- prior\ncrime, and that lesson was don't leave any witnesses.\nDon't leave anybody behind that can testify against you.\nDon't leave any eyewitness.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that goes to his\nblameworthiness. He didn't learn anything in prison. I\n-- I suppose future dangerousness is -- in a sense is\nalways in question, but I think our precedents say it has\nto be specifically or -- or clearly implied.\nMR. NOLAS: I would submit to the Court that\nthat argument indicates to a reasonable jury future\ndangerousness as much as the argument in Simmons itself -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you imagine any capital\ncase, if we accept that argument, in which future\ndangerousness is not at issue? Because whenever you show\nthe depravity of the defendant, what a horrible crime it\nwas, you're going to be able to make the same argument.\nAny jury is going to be frightened of this man and think\nhe's going to be dangerous in the future. If that's all\n-- if that's all that Simmons means, we should just say in\nall capital cases, you assume that it's at issue.\nMR. NOLAS: And -- and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that seems to be not what\nwe've said.\nMR. NOLAS: And, Justice Scalia, that's not,\nhowever, the issue before the Court. What this prosecutor\ntold the jury is this man learned a lesson that when he\ncommits his repeated crimes, he shouldn't leave any\nwitnesses behind.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that -\nMR. NOLAS: I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that goes -- I -- I would\nmake that argument to show how -- how horrible this crime\nwas. He killed this person specifically in order to\nprevent testimony, which makes the -- the crime worse. I\ndon't think it necessarily goes to future dangerousness\nany more than any of the element -- other elements of\ndepravity or -- or the horribleness of the crime goes -\ngoes to future dangerousness.\nMR. NOLAS: And -- and this is in the context of\na prosecutor who elicited that Mr. Rompilla had been\nparoled 3 and a half months before the offense, that his\nniece and nephew were scared of him, that he could not\nrehabilitate yourself. Indeed, I -- I urge the Court to\nread the cross examination of the defense witnesses at the\npenalty phase. It's short, it's narrow, and it focuses on\nthis guy couldn't rehabilitate himself. This guy was just\nparoled 3 and a half months and then goes and commits this\nbrutal murder. And this guy's niece and nephew are afraid\nof him. That's the context.\nAlso, the prior victim -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you -- you expect us\nin all future cases to read the prosecution's argument and\n-- and say, well, has it gone over the line from just his\ndepravity into he's future -- you know, he's going to be\ndangerous in the future?\nMR. NOLAS: But -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that puts too much of a\nburden on -- on the Federal courts.\nMR. NOLAS: But, Justice Scalia, it's not just\nthe depravity argument. The argument is he learned a\nlesson to leave no witnesses behind. And the -- the\nsimplest answer to your question is to compare the\nargument in Simmons to the argument in this case. You\nquoted the argument in Simmons in your Simmons dissent.\nIt was the -- this is the prosecutor in Simmons. The\ndefense in this case as -- the defense in this case as to\nthe sentence is a diversion. It's putting the blame on\nsociety, on his father, on his grandmother, on whoever\nelse he can, spreading it out to avoid his personal\nresponsibility. But we are not concerned about how he got\nshaped. We are concerned about what to do with him now\nthat he is within our midst. And that was the argument\nthat Justice O'Connor and the plurality in Simmons cited\nas bringing future dangerousness to the jury's attention.\nTo put it -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this prosecutor also\nsaid, before he got into isn't it frightening, I'm not\nasking you for vengeance. So if he's not putting it on\nfor vengeance or the bad acts that he did, then what else\ncould it be?\nMR. NOLAS: Future dangerousness is -- is what\nwe would submit to the Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about justice? I mean, is\nthat the only alternative to vengeance, is -- is future\ndangerousness? I don't think so at all.\nMR. NOLAS: When you tell a jury that a person\nis a violent recidivist who learns the lesson -- he's a\nrecidivist. He's going to commit more crimes if he's out.\nThe lesson he learns is when he commits those more crimes,\ndon't leave anybody behind.\nI -- I see that as an argument that -- that is\nfar beyond Simmons itself as to future dangerousness. In\nfuture dangerousness, Justice Scalia, you -- you argued in\nthe dissent that the future dangerousness -- that what the\nplurality and Justice O'Connor construed as a future\ndangerousness argument could have had another purpose.\nOnly in a State like Texas where you have a pure future\ndangerousness argument, in every State where you have\nother aggravators before the jury, of course you can\nconstrue it for another -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was no\nproblem in any State but Pennsylvania because now all of\nthem -- when the jury wants to know does life mean life,\nthe judge says yes.\nMR. NOLAS: In all of them except Pennsylvania,\nYour Honor. I'm not saying it's a problem, but in\nresponse to Justice Scalia's question, only in a pure\nfuture dangerousness State will you have a pure future\ndangerousness argument.\nAnd just one final comment on Simmons. As a\nprosecutor, if I'm putting on a future dangerousness case,\nI do it just like this prosecutor do it. I put on this\nman's significant violent criminal history. I tell the\njury the lessons he learned from that history is to be\nviolent and to not leave anybody behind. And I tell the\njury that's what he's like. That's what he learned from\nhis prior crimes. That's the message of future\ndangerousness you send to the jury. That's the message\nthat this prosecutor sent, exactly how you would do it if\nyou were arguing future dangerousness. You know from the\njury's question they got that message.\nIf I may, I'd reserve the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may reserve your\ntime.\nMR. NOLAS: Your Honor, thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Zapp.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY ZAPP\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. ZAPP: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nI'll address first the Simmons issue and then\nmove on to the ineffectiveness issue, which will also be\naddressed by the Solicitor General's office.\nThe ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in\nthis case, which denied the petitioner relief under\nSimmons v. South Carolina, was objectively reasonable and\ntherefore did not provide a basis for habeas relief.\nSimmons could reasonably be understood to\nrequire an instruction about parole ineligibility only in\nsituations where the prosecution had argued that the\ndefendant posed a future danger when it was asking the\njury to sentence him to death. Simmons was a narrow\nexception to the abiding practice of this Court to allow\nthe States to make decisions about what types of\ninformation the sentencing jury should receive with\nrespect to the potential for early release.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you take the\nposition that the -- that the argument that the prosecutor\nmakes has got to refer explicitly to future dangerousness,\na kind of talismanic words criterion so that we'll have a\nbright line rule and everyone will know where -- where he\nstands?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, I think Simmons could be\nunderstood -- and in fact did establish a bright line rule\nthat the prosecutor had to actually argue it had to invite\nthe -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But has -- has the\nprosecutor got to use a phrase like future dangerousness\nor a synonym for that phrase?\nMS. ZAPP: I think he had to use words that\ncommunicated that. I'm not sure there's any one\nparticular phrase, but a prosecutor can certainly put that\ninto issue -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well -\nMS. ZAPP: -- using different -- different\nwords.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we -- if we don't adopt\nthat kind of explicit words criterion, do you deny that\nthe -- that the argument that the prosecutor made,\nparticularly the -- by -- by introducing the -- the\nevidence of -- of the prior crime for purposes of the\naggravating factor and the argument that he made about how\nthe defendant had learned from his prior crime -- do you\n-- do you deny that -- that those were in fact, not with\nthe talismanic words, but that those in fact were -- were\narguments that suggested future dangerousness?\nMS. ZAPP: I do, Your Honor. And my -- my\nreason for that is when you look to the argument itself,\nthose words were used in a very controlled situation.\nThey -- they did not by their tone or the overall tenor of\nthe argument or their content tell the jury to take the -\nthe defendant's future dangerousness into account.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't see how the -\nI -- I guess my -- my point is I don't see how you can\navoid it. The -- the argument -- I think we would all\nagree that the argument was this person has committed\nrepeated crimes. We're asking you to bear that in mind\nfor the purposes of applying one of the three aggravating\nfactors. In the course of committing repeated crimes, he\nhas learned from past mistakes; i.e., he knows this time\nnot to leave any witnesses.\nHow can you divide the tendency of that\nargument, repeated crimes for purposes of aggravation,\nfrom the tendency of that argument to say repeated crimes\nin the future if he gets a chance? This is the kind of\nguy we're dealing with. How can you draw that line?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, I think this Court has said\nthat you can draw that line because -- and you have to\ndraw that line because in this situation -- because in\nevery situation, every capital situation, the evidence\nthat necessarily has to be discussed as part of sentencing\ncan be -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but this is -- this is a\nspecial case. This is not a general argument to the\neffect that this is a very bad person and we can expect\nbad persons to be bad in the future. This is a more\nspecific argument. This is an argument that says he's now\ndone it twice. This is the second crime and he's getting\nbetter at it as he goes along because now he kills the\nwitnesses. This isn't just generalized badness. This is\ncriminal repetitiveness. It is recidivism. And it seems\nto me that that is a much clearer argument. It is much\ncloser to the explicit argument that he will do it in the\nfuture.\nMS. ZAPP: I -- I don't think so in the specific\ncontext of this case, Your Honor, and that's again because\nthe evidence in this situation really did not show a\ncontinuing sequence of -- of conduct and only talked about\ntwo episodes. And the fact that there was evidence in -\nor there were remarks in this case about how the violence\nhad escalated did not, again, go to -- suggest and -- and\nclearly the tone of the prosecutor did not suggest that\nthe jury should draw from that a conclusion that the\ndefendant would be dangerous.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Zapp, I guess -- I guess\nI'm confused about your case. I had thought that you were\nnot arguing that Simmons requires a talismanic word or\neven that it requires much more than existed here. I\nthought what you were arguing is simply that Simmons could\nat that time have been interpreted that way.\nMS. ZAPP: We are, Your Honor, and -- and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're not -- you're not\nmaking the argument.\nMS. ZAPP: We are not making the argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying the argument\ncould have been made at -- at the time of this trial -\nMS. ZAPP: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and before our later\njurisprudence.\nMS. ZAPP: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And why would that argument\nhave been reasonable?\nMS. ZAPP: Because -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, why -- why\nwould we -- why would it be reasonable to assume that this\nCourt had -- had established a constitutional rule going\nto jury instruction that rested on a kind of talismanic\ncriterion?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, because the concurring opinion,\nwhich provides the -- this precise holding, identified\nthat specific conduct as triggering and could be\nunderstood at the time to require that specific conduct to\ntrigger an instruction in these circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what specific words in\n-- in the concurring opinion gets to the talismanic point?\nMS. ZAPP: The specific words were the -- the\nCourt's instruction that an -- about a charge on all\nineligibility had to be supplied, and I'm going to quote\nfrom the Court's opinion where -- where the prosecution\nargues that the defendant will pose a threat to -- to\nsociety in the future.\nThat -- that opinion -- and just a few lines\nearlier it also said, again -- and I'm going to quote the\nwords -- if the prosecution does not argue future\ndangerousness, the State may appropriately decide that\nparole is not a proper issue for the jury's consideration\neven if the only sentencing alternative to death is life\nin prison without the possibility of parole.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and you're -- you're\ndepending on the word, in effect, argue as -- as requiring\n-- or as -- as being a basis to say the argument has got\nto use talismanic words.\nMS. ZAPP: Not -- not that -- not that it has to\nuse talismanic -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it has to be\nargued.\nMS. ZAPP: Exactly, that has to be argument as\nopposed to some other form of communication -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not just intimated, not\njust suggested, but the jury -- you have to argue that\nthis person --\nMS. ZAPP: But by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is dangerous in the future.\nMS. ZAPP: But by contrast -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a reasonable\ninterpretation of it I would think.\nMS. ZAPP: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And on that interpretation, why\nwasn't it an argument within the meaning of -- of your\npoint, when the prosecutor here got up and said, isn't it\nfrightening, he has, in effect, learned from his past\nexperience, now he knows enough to kill the witnesses?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, first of all, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't that an argument which\n-- which goes to future dangerousness?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, first of all, Your Honor, he\ndid not make that argument. He never asked if it was\nfrightening that he had learned from this. The word\nfrightening -- again, this has been used out of context by\nmy -- my learned colleague -- went to -- strictly went to\nthe discussion of similarities between the crimes, not the\ndefendant. And in this situation -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, but what immediately\nfollows -- first he said it's absolutely frightening\ntwice. But there is one difference, one major difference,\nand the difference is that he has learned to leave no\nwitnesses. That is tightly connected. He says this is an\nabsolutely frightening crime, but there's something more.\nHe's learned not to leave any witnesses.\nMS. ZAPP: But -- but again, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat goes to the idea that the defendant has ratcheted up\nhis crime, that instead of taking the opportunity to\nreform his life, he's gone further and that makes this\ncrime worse and -- and more worthy of harsher treatment\nfrom a punishing standpoint.\nMS. ZAPP: It is our position that in 1998 when\nthe State courts ruled, it was entirely reasonable for the\nSupreme Court to view Simmons as requiring that issues of\nfuture dangerousness be generated by the prosecution's\nargument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I know you want to get to\nthe other issue in this case, but let me ask you. You've,\nI assume, read these cases. In -- in other States where\nthis instruction is given, is the prosecutor free to say,\nwell, sure, there's life without parole, but that can\nchange? We don't know what the law will be like 3 years\nfrom now, 5. Have there been any problems along that -\nalong those lines? Have there been any problems generally\nin giving this instruction to the jury?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure of the\npractice in other States, but I can tell you that in\nPennsylvania -- and this is a point I need to correct from\nmy opponent's argument. The answer to the question about\nparole eligibility is not a simple no. And that -- our\nsupreme court has said that. We have a statutory\nprohibition in granting the -- granting parole to someone\nwho's sentenced to life, but we also have a constitutional\nprovision that allows the sentence to be commuted to,\namong other things, parole or other forms of early\nrelease. Our State supreme court has said you -- in order\nto be entirely accurate for sentencing jury, you've got to\ncommunicate both of those conducts.\nAnd -- and the second part that has over the\nyears -- and this goes to respond to your question -- has\ncaused our court some pause in why we retain the rule.\nAnd that is they are very concerned. Our courts have\nexpressed the view that by letting the jury know that the\noperation of the constitutional provision which can\ntheoretically -- and, in fact, in the past often has\nresulted in a life sentence being commuted -- it may be\nskewing the jury's perception of the punishments adversely\nto a defendant. It's one of the reasons why they have\nmade a decision not to introduce sentencing information\ninto -- early release information into the sentencing\nprocess in Pennsylvania, the concern that if a jury hears\nthat there's some theoretical possibility or learns that\nit has been -- been actual -- there's been actual early\nrelease in the past, that it may -- may, out of an\nexercise of caution, automatically choose a death\nsentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that explains why your\nState is the only holdout.\nMS. ZAPP: Well, I'm sorry. Well, that it's -\nthey -- they have serious concerns, Your Honor, that -\nthat this is something that is necessary to the integrity\nof the process.\nAnd there are two other concerns they've also\nmentioned too. They're -- they're concerns that -- that\nthe jury be deflected from the specific process that we\nhave under law which -- which is -- which is specified in\nour law for -- for imposing a sentence and not be\ndistracted by undue speculation about whether or not the\ndefendant is ever going to be released from prison.\nAnd the second -- or excuse me. The third point\nthat they're worried about is that a sentencing jury who,\nfor whatever reason, becomes reluctant to -- to carry out\nits duties may see this as an opportunity to shift the\nsentencing burden to somebody like a parole board or -- or\nother sentencing authority. And so that's why they have\n-- they've enforced this rule because they just see it as\nunderscoring the integrity of the process.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question about\nthe competence of counsel issue? One -- I'm -- I'm very\nsympathetic to the problems of busy lawyers who have so\nmuch to do and they're preparing for a penalty hearing.\nBut one -- one aspect of this case -- I hope you'll\ncomment -- and that is, the fact that the prosecutor had\ntold the defense they were going to use certain\naggravating circumstances, and the files in those -\nrelating to those circumstances were available in the\ncourthouse. And as I understand -- and you correct me if\nI'm wrong -- counsel did not examine those files, and had\nhe examined those files, he would have opened the door to\na wealth of information. Isn't that a fairly serious\nmistake by the lawyer?\nMS. ZAPP: Not in this circumstance, Justice\nStevens, and -- and for this reason. The information that\nis typically contained in those files -- and -- and again,\nI -- I want to add some additional information for the -\nfor the Court on this point. As Mr. Nolas says,\nPennsylvania law does require preparation of records,\nincluding certain types of information. But as -- as is\noften the case, the -- the -- in -- in practical -- and\nthe practical realities are not necessarily all records\nare equal. So as a matter of practice, in Pennsylvania\nattorneys cannot necessarily -- or would not automatically\nhave reason to think these may give them a wealth of\ninformation.\nBut in this situation we had counsel seeking to\nobtain that very same information, in fact, had previously\ndiscussed that sort of thing with the family members. And\nso they at that point would have reasonably expected that\nthey had a fair picture of the defendant's formative\nyears -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe they -- assume\nthat's all true. They thought they knew everything -\nMS. ZAPP: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- they needed to know. But\nstill, if you say to me I'm going to put on certain\nexhibits, A, B, and C, and the defense says I'm not even\ngoing to even take a look at them before you put them on,\nI find that quite unusual.\nMS. ZAPP: Well, they knew from interviewing\ntheir client what his criminal history was, and at that -\nthis point, they had every reason to believe they\npossessed a fair and accurate assessment of his\nbackground, and the decision not to -- to go -- to -- to\ntake a look at this was -- was reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Counsel thought they already had that\ninformation and no reason to expect there was anything\nelse in there based on their discussions with their own\nclient.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They thought they had -- it\nwas reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that\nthis man might not even be competent at the moment to\nstand trial, that he -- that they might have a -- a basis\nfor an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to\nrely just on what he told them without looking at the\nrecord that was in the prosecutor's hands?\nMS. ZAPP: Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg.\nwe're talking about the sequence of events here. The -\nthis -- this came up relatively later on in the\nproceedings after counsel had already expended much of\ntheir time gathering information in the -- the information\nabout what was going to be introduced. It -- it happens,\nin -- in terms of the time line of this case, relatively\nlate, after counsel has already talked to experts and\nobtained information, talked to family members and -\nand -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. You're\nrepeating that point which -- so I might ask this question\non this very point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- could I find out what\nshe said came late? I -- I didn't understand. You\nsaid -\nMS. ZAPP: The -- the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it came -- what came\nrelatively late?\nMS. ZAPP: The -- I'm sorry. The -- the file\nitself, the -- the information the file was going to be\nused.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Came up late.\nMS. ZAPP: Comparatively late over the course of\nthis case. The counsel had already done things in that\nrespect that would have led them to conclude that there\nwould be no profit in -- in searching out additional\nrecords.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is this, that I\ntake it on page L31 is the record that existed in this\nhorrendous rape '74 case with Jo, whatever, the woman, the\nbartender. And the prosecution was making an enormous\namount out of that. We've just heard about it. That's\ntrue, isn't it? Am I right about the case? Have I got\nthat right?\nMS. ZAPP: This is the record that did exist.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. This is -- I'm thinking\nof it correctly, that this is the record in the case that\nthe prosecution made a lot out of.\nMS. ZAPP: I believe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- I'm back with Justice\nStevens then and I wonder how it's possible a lawyer\nwouldn't look at the record in that very case if only to\nsee if the prosecutor is characterizing the situation\naccurately. And had he done so, he would have seen on the\nnext page, alcohol problems. He would have seen a\ncomplete list of siblings, and he would have seen, four\npages later, a one-page list of criminal behavior with\nidentification of crimes that took place when he was a\nchild. That's all true.\nNow, if he had then noticed these early criminal\nrecords when he was a 17-year-old and simply gotten the\nrecord in that one, he would have come across the document\nthat is on page L44 and L45 which says, among other\nthings, Ronald comes from the notorious Rompilla family.\nAnd then there is a list of why they are called the\nnotorious Rompilla family which is fairly horrendous.\nNow, I do not understand how any person, getting\nthe first record, wouldn't have been led to the second,\nand I do not understand how any person who read pages 44\nand 45 of the second would not have thought what the\nsiblings are telling me is wrong. I better go check on a\nfew more siblings who happen to have their names and\naddresses here right in the pieces of paper he's looking\nat. And he would then have discovered this absolutely\nhorrendous background that Judge Sloviter mentions. So I\ndo not understand why that one incident, leaving aside all\nthe other ones, but I do not understand why that one\nfailure to consult the record that is being used by the\nprosecutor horrendously against him is not a failure.\nMS. ZAPP: Well, Your -- Your Honor, in response\nto that, I would say this. It's clear from the testimony\nof counsel in the State post-conviction proceedings that\nthey had interviewed their client in great detail about\nhis prior conviction, that they were aware of what had -\nwhat it had involved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This sounds to me like a\nconstitutional argument for serendipity. You're held to\nbe negligent if you don't look at the record for -- for\none purpose and -- and discover by accident something\nthat's there for another purpose. I -- I don't know what\nthe logic of that is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree with that?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, I think there is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. We don't -- you agree with\nthat or not?\nMS. ZAPP: Well, I think there's -- there is an\nelement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You either agree with Justice\nKennedy or not.\nMS. ZAPP: I can agree with -- I do agree with\nit in part.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You do agree. All right. Now,\nif you -\nMS. ZAPP: I -- I do agree that there is -- that\nthere is certainly that involved in -- in this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my question, obviously,\nis, is not the reason that you want to examine the\ncriminal record in the case that is being used\nhorrendously against your client is to find out both as to\nwhat happened at the time and also the background that\nwould be relevant in respect to your client? For example,\nalcohol abuse, which happened to be checked.\nMS. ZAPP: But -- but, Justice Breyer, yes,\ncertainly looking at a record would serve those purposes.\nBut again, the information in those records was available\nfrom other sources. It was not the only source. And -\nand the question that we have to look at here was did\ncounsel set out on a plan to try to get the same\ninformation, which clearly they did, and they -- they\nsought to get it from people who ostensibly knew that\ninformation.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Zapp.\nMs. Lovitt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACI L. LOVITT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. LOVITT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nPetitioner's ineffectiveness argument seems to\nbe hinging on four things which are the court records in\nthe aggravation case, the charge to the expert, the family\nmembers' level of cooperation, and the petitioner's level\nof cooperation. But a fair reading of the record\ndemonstrates that counsel was reasonable with respect to\nall. But I want to start with the court records because\nthat appears to be what's concerning the Court.\nI think there's a misperception here that\ncounsel did nothing to prepare for the aggravation case.\nThe record, fairly read, reflects that they received\nthrough the discovery process the rap sheet and everything\nthey needed to know in order to challenge the -- the\naggravation case, and that's at JA664 and 667, is Attorney\nCharles testifying that he received the rap sheet through\ndiscovery and that the prosecutor, in order to try and\ninduce a plea, was very, very clear about what he intended\nto do in aggravation and what the aggravation case would\nbe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But a rap sheet and so forth\nwill not have normally what this person is like. You're\ndealing with a client who has serious problems of some\nkind as the crimes themselves reveal. They're terrible.\nMS. LOVITT: I -- I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- don't you\nthink it's a reasonable -- or do you think it's a\nreasonable constitutional requirement to say that where\ncases of prior history of the client are being used by the\nprosecution to say what a terrible person he is -- and he\nmay be -- that you -- the -- the lawyer in a capital case\nat least should look at the court records in that case to\nlearn something about what this human being is like and\nwhy? Because court records, but not rap sheets do contain\nthat kind of thing.\nMS. LOVITT: I think there are two answers to\nthat question. First is that counsel was, in fact,\nlooking at the testimony that would be read at -- during\nthe aggravation and sentencing case to determine how to\nchallenge that, how best to challenge that.\nAnd second, the assumption of the question is\nthat the court records were somehow superior to the\nsources that counsel actually looked to. And I don't\nthink on the record of this case, that's objectively true.\nCounsel is -- has -- has hired three independent experts,\nall of whom are specifically trained -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Experts that were hired\nprimarily to say what is his present mental condition, not\nwhat happened in the past.\nMS. LOVITT: No, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm glad\nyou brought this up because I'd like to point the Court to\nJA1069 and 1079 which is where Dr. Cooke testifies, as\nJustice Scalia anticipated, that he was, in fact, asked to\n-- asked to look at the mitigation evidence, and he did\nlook at mitigation evidence. Dr. Sadoff has the same\ntestimony -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the primary reason\nthat those experts were engaged?\nMS. LOVITT: Dr. -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The primary reason.\nMS. LOVITT: Dr. Cooke's and -- Drs. Cooke and\nSadoff testified that they were given an open-ended charge\nto look at mitigation -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is this?\nMS. LOVITT: First, Dr. Cooke is at JA1079 and\n1069. Dr. Sadoff is at 1105 and 1122.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was not\ncontested that in fact the primary reason why these\ndoctors were engaged was that the defense attorney wanted\nto see if there was a basis for a plea of insanity. He\nwanted to see if there was a basis to claim that his\nclient was incompetent to stand trial.\nMS. LOVITT: That is -- that is definitely\ncontested with respect to Drs. Cooke and Sadoff. With\nrespect to Dr. Gross, who was the first expert that was\nhired, he testified that his marching orders were fairly\nlimited, and I think that's where this idea is coming\nacross that all the experts were only charged to look for\ncompetency to stand trial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And Dr. Gross is the one who -\nwho in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism I\nthink.\nMS. LOVITT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And one way, at least a kind of\na threshold step to follow up on alcoholism, would have\nbeen to look at the -- the personal history report in the\nfile of the prior case. If they had done so, they would\nhave found something on that subject.\nSo even -- even if we forget the question of the\n-- the scope of the expert's original brief and we look to\nDr. Gross' suggestion and we look to the failure to look\nin an obvious place, i.e., the -- the personal history\nreport and -- and the case file, which the State said it\nwas going to use, don't we have a problem with competence\nof counsel?\nMS. LOVITT: No, because counsel looked -\nfollowed up in an objectively reasonable place. Their\ntestimony was that they hired two more experts to look at\nthis issue, and Dr. Gross did not conclude -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the two other\npsychiatrists or psychologists?\nMS. LOVITT: The two -- the two other\npsychiatrists. Because the issue wasn't alcoholism.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wel, were they -- were they\nhired to -- to look into alcoholism?\nMS. LOVITT: No. Dr. Gross' report says he\nmight have a violent reaction to alcohol. And he\ntestified that was -- I was throwing that out as a theory.\nI have no idea. I had ruled out alcoholism. I had ruled\nout blackouts. And so the question to me was maybe\nthere's something out there about violent chemical\nreactions to alcohol. Counsel testified that the -- that\nthey followed up on that by hiring experts who they\nthought could examine that issue, and they both concluded\nthat there was nothing there.\nThis is not an instance where you have, you\nknow, open inquiries that counsel didn't follow up on.\nEvery court in this case has recognized -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you tell me again? I'm\n-- I'm just afraid I missed it before. What is your\njustification for failing to look at the -- at the\ncriminal files?\nMS. LOVITT: That they received everything they\nneeded to challenge the aggravation case through\ndiscovery. And there's a little bit -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So even if they did, would it\n-- you still think it would be prudent not even to look at\nthe file?\nMS. LOVITT: They had everything they needed to\nchallenge the aggravation -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they didn't have as much\nas they would have had if they'd looked at the file.\nMS. LOVITT: But the Sixth Amendment question -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with that?\nMS. LOVITT: I -- I think that they had -\nobviously, in retrospect, the court files would have been\nhelpful, but they had nothing to signal that the court\nfiles would give them more information.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that. I'm\njust -- I'm just asking you whether, as a matter of\nroutine preparation for a contested hearing, it is not the\nduty of counsel to take -- at least glance at the exhibits\nthat the other side is going to offer.\nMS. LOVITT: They did. They received them\nthrough discovery. And this is -- there's some testimony\nduring -- during the court proceedings, Attorney Dantos\ndoes not have the transcript with her, and she clarified\nin the testimony at post-conviction -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying they did get\ncopies of the -\nMS. LOVITT: Yes, yes, and that's her testimony\nat JA506 to 508. She says, we received it in discovery\nand I had it and I've looked it, but I didn't have it with\nme at that moment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the it? What is the\nit?\nMS. LOVITT: The it being the transcripts of the\nproceedings that were used in the aggravation phase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not everything that was\nin that file.\nMS. LOVITT: But they did not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a lot more than\njust the transcript of the proceedings in that file.\nMS. LOVITT: Exactly. Because they had\nconducted an objectively reasonable investigation into\nanything else that might be in that file.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the serious question to\nme is -- is -- in many of these cases which we see, there\nare horrendous child abuse histories, and child abuse is a\nterribly difficult thing to get at and it's something that\nmight not convince most juries of anything because they're\nall over the place. But nonetheless, counsel should have\nto make a reasonable decision about whether to take the\nchild abuse route or to take some other route. And would\nit cause constitutional harm, that is, would it cause harm\neven from a prosecutorial point of view, if you just said,\nwell, you should follow up and look at records of prior\ncases being used against you to see if you get a clue\nthere?\nMS. LOVITT: Well, the testimony is clear.\nCounsel knew about the abuse denial dynamic and they did\nfollow up on it by hiring three experts who were charged\nto ferret this out. And it would do constitutional harm\nto say, notwithstanding the fact that you did that, you\nstill have to go to records because as Strickland\nrecognizes, counsel, even where you have diligent, devoted\ncounsel, as here, have to make decisions about resource\nand time allocation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Strickland was about a\nstrategic decision to pursue one kind of defense rather\nthan another.\nThe Government's brief, I must say, was candid\nand, I think, useful. I'm talking about footnote 5 on\npage 22 where you say the Federal public defenders in\nFederal death penalty cases -- they get a mitigation\nspecialist and the mitigation specialist, of course, gets\nrecords. What records? Exactly what we're talking about\nin this case. Gets records, birth, schools, social\nwelfare, employment, jail, medical, and other records.\nAnd here, not one of those -- not one -- was sought.\nMS. LOVITT: But this was the current -- this is\nthe current Federal practice. I think Attorney Charles\ntestifies at length that the prevailing practice in 1988\nin Pennsylvania was not to get records, that it was, as\nthe ABA guidelines and even the Goodpaster article\nsuggests, to first sit down with your client, have an\nextensive conversation with your client, get a\nrelationship of trust, talk to family members, talk to\nfriends, get experts, and then get a game plan together\nabout what records to go to. And in this case -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: About what records to go to,\nand here they went to none.\nMS. LOVITT: Because that objectively reasonable\ninvestigation affirmatively indicated that the records\nwould contain nothing.\nIn hindsight, we have the benefit of hindsight\nto know that they did contain something, but at that point\nyou have three experts, siblings who bracket petitioner in\nage and were living in the same household that -- during\nthe time that's at issue here, and you have extended\nfamily members, including an ex-wife, who aren't subject\nto an abuse denial dynamic, and they're all saying the\nsame thing. There's no abuse. There's no alcohol problem\nwith either him or the family. And the experts are\ntelling you he's not mentally retarded. And you have\nexperts who are specifically charged to look at the\nmitigation case and they're not finding anything.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Lovitt.\nMr. Nolas, you have about 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honors. Thank you very\nmuch.\nJustice Kennedy, you asked a question about\nserendipity. That's why you conduct an investigation.\nThat's why you look into records. That's why this Court\nhas said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough,\ndiligent investigation. When I go and I look at a prior\nconviction court file, I don't know if it's going to say\nthat my client is the worst person on the face of the\nearth or, as in this case, that it's going to provide\nevidence leading to mental retardation, significant mental\ndisturbance, and a critically abusive childhood. You do\nthat investigation because the prior conviction court file\nmay contain information that reduces the weight of the\naggravating factor.\nIn this case, had counsel gotten that court\nfile, as Justice Breyer summarized, they would have had\nevidence that not only would have reduced the weight of\nthat prior aggravating factor that -- but that would have\nprovided something mitigating for this jury. Indeed, Ms.\nZapp quotes at page 41 the 1980 ABA standards that very\nclearly say, please, for mercy, do not substitute for an\nactual thorough investigation of mitigating evidence and\npresentation of mitigating evidence. And all these\nlawyers ended up with was an unconnected plea for mercy\nbecause they didn't take the steps that reasonable counsel\ntake in a capital case.\nI also urge this Court not to be misled by -- by\nsome commentary today about the testimony of the lawyers.\nAt page 506, Ms. Dantos very clearly says that she's read\nthe transcript of the penalty phase when that prior\nconviction court file is brought in by the trial\nprosecutor. And at that point, Mr. Charles, her co\ncounsel, says, I object. I've never seen that before.\nAnd the trial prosecutor says, you could have walked down\nthe hall and gotten it just like I did. That's -- that's\nwhat's she referring to at page 506.\nAs far as the doctors are concerned, I'll just\nread to Your Honors just from Ms. Dantos herself. She has\nread at pages 473 and 474 what Dr. Gross had said. I only\nlooked at mental state at the time of the offense. Is\nthat the purpose of the -- is that what the purpose of the\nevaluation was? Yes, that's what it was as to Dr. Gross.\nThen at page 475, Dr. Cooke, the second guy.\nDid the same evaluation? Yes, the same evaluation.\nAt page 476, Dr. Sadoff, the third doctor. And\nis that also what Dr. Sadoff did? Yes. Page 476.\nAll three of the mental health professionals\nlooked at Mr. Rompilla's mental state at the time of the\ncommission of the crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only? Only? Only?\nMR. NOLAS: That's the lawyer herself saying\nwhat she asked the doctors to do. And if you look at -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's uncontested that\nall three looked into that, but the point that has been\nmade is that the last two went beyond that. Do you\ndisagree with that?\nMR. NOLAS: I disagree with that, Your Honor,\nand you should look at those pages from Ms. Dantos and\nthen look at the pages from Dr. Cooke and Dr. Sadoff.\nThis is Dr. Sadoff at page 1105. I would have\nexamined him, Rompilla, for competency to stand trial. I\nwould have examined him for criminal responsibilities, and\nI would have examined him for possibility of mitigating\ncircumstances at the time of the commission of the crime.\nThere is a universal difference between that\ntype of mental health examination and a life history\nmitigation examination that looks to are there factors in\nyour life that the jury should consider as mitigating.\nWas there abuse? Was there neglect? Was there\nmistreatment in the home? Was there all the stuff that is\nin the records about this case that these counsel did not\nobtain? Not one piece of paper. Justice Kennedy, not\neven to rebut the aggravating factor, not even to do that.\nA basic duty. Even if you put a spin over mitigation, I\nas a lawyer want to rebut that aggravating factor. The\nprosecutor tells me that's the file to go look at. I go\nlook at it. Any reasonable lawyer, I would think, would\ndo that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Nolas.\nMR. NOLAS: Your Honors, thank you very much.\n"
