ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ZIEVE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRule 54(d) provides a standard for an award\nof costs to a prevailing party that, by the Rule's\nexpress terms, does not apply where Federal statute\nprovides otherwise. The Fair Debt Collection Practices\nAct provides otherwise because it states a different\nrule for awarding costs than does Rule 54(d). Whereas\nRule 54(d) gives district courts wide discretion toward\ncost-prevailing defendants, the FDCPA limits courts'\ndiscretion to cases brought in bad faith and for the\npurpose of harassment.\nThe text of the Act provides that, on a\nfinding that action was brought in bad faith and for the\npurpose of harassment, the court may award attorneys'\nfees of reasonable relation to the work expended and\ncosts. That's a matter of grammar. The unmistakable\nmeaning of that sentence is that an award of costs, like\nan award of attorney's fees, is subject to the condition\nthat the plaintiff's suit be brought --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under -- under that\nprovision, that's certainly true. You can't -- you\ncan't get costs under that provision unless there has\nbeen that prerequisite. But it's -- you know, it's\nancient law that repeals by implication are not favored.\nAnd what you're arguing here is that that provision\neffectively repeals another provision which allows costs\nin all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior.\nNow, why -- why is this an exception to our\ngeneral rule? I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me\nlike a clear repealer.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, there's no need to\nconsider repeal by implication in this case, Your Honor,\nbecause Rule 54(d) expressly states that its presumption\ndoes not apply for a Federal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, indeed, but -- but\nyou are assuming a conflict. You're saying either\nthe -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but\nthe statute can be read to say, we're describing one\ncategory of case, we are describing the worst case, the\nbad-faith harassing plaintiff, and the statute deals\nwith that category of person and no other.\nSo if you're not a bad-faith harassing\nplaintiff, but you, nonetheless, lost, then you're under\n54(d).\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, Your Honor, if you look at\nSection k(a)(3), as a whole, the two sentences together\nconfirm that this is not a provision about bad-faith\nplaintiffs, that rather, the provision is addressing\nboth fees and costs to -- to plaintiffs and defendants.\nAnd if -- if the Congress merely wanted to state in that\nsecond sentence that fees were available and didn't mean\nto say anything about costs to defendants, there would\nhave been no reason for Congress to have put costs in\nthat sentence.\nIf --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there are a number\nof reasons. One is symmetry because they have costs in\nthe part about defendants. And the concern that, well,\nif we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing\nplaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get\nonly attorney's fees and not costs.\nSo the statute's provisions like this may be\nredundant, but one can see that a drafter might very\nwell want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the\ndefendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a\nplaintiff.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, you've made a few points,\nand I'll try to address each of them.\nFirst, there -- there would be no reason to\ninclude costs in the second sentence, just because it\nwas in the first sentence, because the first and second\nsentences are not parallel. The first sentence makes an\naward of costs mandatory, and, therefore, it does do\nsome work beyond 54(d). It clearly has -- has a\nfunction in that sentence. Whereas the second sentence,\nthe award is subject to the \"may,\" that is, that it's\nnot mandatory that the court award them.\nIf -- if Congress was -- Congress would have\nno need to be concerned that if it left costs out of the\nsecond sentence there would be some negative implication\nbecause there are several statutes that mention fees\nwithout costs. And GRC has cited no instance in which a\ncourt has read a negative implication into that.\nWe, in our reply brief, cited a couple cases\nthat do the opposite. If -- so, therefore, if\nCongress had omitted costs, left it out of the sentence,\nthen Rule 54(d) would have continued to apply in cases\nwhere the defendants.\nOne more example --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Didn't -- don't district\ncourts always have the authority to award costs for\nsanctionable behavior like bad faith? So this provision\nis duplicate, no matter how we read it. It's either\nduplicative of a power the court already had to award\ncosts for bad faith, or it's duplicate of Rule 54.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, if you read this sentence\nas a misconduct provision, then it does repeat the\nCourt's inherent authority; although, as this Court has\nmentioned in a couple cases, sometimes, statutes want to\nreiterate authority that exists elsewhere.\nIf you read it our way, however, the\nstatute -- this provision does actually do some work\nthat it wouldn't otherwise do; that is, it limits cost\nawards to prevailing defendants of these circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It limits Rule 54.\nMS. ZIEVE: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think your -- your\nanswer is always that Rule 54 obligates courts to give\ncosts. And this rule, as you read it, is a permissive\ngrant only. Even in bad faith litigations, the court\ncould choose not to give costs.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, Rule 54 doesn't obligate a\ncourt to give costs. It establishes a presumption --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: True.\nMS. ZIEVE: -- and this says the presumption\nis limited to cases brought in bad faith and for\npurposes of harassment. There are other statutes that\ndo -- similarly, do what we've -- what's done here.\nCongress could have omitted -- if GRC is correct,\nCongress could have just omitted the words, \"and costs,\"\nleaving the costs to be determined under Rule 54.\nAn example of that is 15 U.S.C. 15c(d)(2),\nwhich is actions by state attorneys general and provides\nthat the court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing\ndefendant upon a finding that the action was in bad\nfaith.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Zieve, if we look at\nother statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at\nstatutes involving lenders, so we would look at the --\nthe Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the\nCredit Organizations Act --\nMS. ZIEVE: Fair Credit?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and those do not\nprovide for attorney's fees. They are covered only\nunder 54(d), which is costs, not fees. Why should we\nread this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant\nunder this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off\nwith respect to costs than defendants under the other\nlending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)?\nCongress gave defendants something more\nhere. Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d)\nwould apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending\nAct, but not to the lender under -- under this Act?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, first, Your Honor, the --\nCongress' purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a\ndefendant-friendly provision. Congress had dual\npurposes in enacting k(a)(3). On the one hand, Congress\nwanted to deter nuisance suits. But on the other hand,\nCongress wanted to ensure that meritorious suits by\nimpecunious debtors were not deterred by the prospect\nthat an award of costs would exceed the value of the\ndamage that could be recovered in a successful suit.\nAnd the two provisions of k(a)(3) show the line Congress\ndrew -- drew and how it balanced those two objectives.\nAs to the other statutes, the Truth in\nLending Act, the Credit Repair Organizations Act, they\nwere enacted at different times by different Congresses.\nThey have different sorts of provisions, some better for\nplaintiffs, some better for defendants.\nAnd -- but this category -- in -- in\nenacting this statute, Congress emphasized that the\nwidespread and national serious problem of collection\nabuse that Congress said inflicts substantial suffering\nand anguish, and noted specifically in the Senate report\nthis Court has cited to in the Jerman case, that\nconsumers, the impecunious -- the people who can't even\nafford to pay their debts, are the primary enforcers of\nthe statute.\nThe FTC got about 120,000 complaints from\nconsumers about debt collectors last year, more than any\nother industry. So Congress may reasonably have decided\nthat the primary enforcers of this statute weren't going\nto be doing that work if they were -- if they were at\nrisk of significant cost awards in cases that have\nfrequently small value.\nThere are other ways, if Congress wanted to\npreserve Rule 54(d), that it could have done it, that\ndid not happen here. For instance, in 49 U.S.C.\n14707(c), Congress has a similar provision about\nattorney's fees to prevailing -- attorney's fees to\nprevailing parties, and then states expressly that fee\nis in addition to costs allowable under the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure. Congress didn't do that here.\nOr Congress could have made it clear that it\nwas not displacing Rule 54(d) as to cost awards by\nstating that the Court could award attorney's fees as\npart of the cost, therefore, distinguishing fees and\ncosts. Congress has done that sort of thing frequently,\nincluding in a statute that provides for an award in\ncases of bad faith.\nI'm looking at 28 U.S.C. 1875, that provides\nthe courts may award fees as part of costs if an action\nwas frivolous or in bad faith.\nSo -- but Congress did none of those things\nhere. Instead, what it did was draft a sentence that\nlinks the term \"cost\" to the term \"attorney's fees\" with\nthe conjunction \"and\" and subjects both of those objects\nof the sentence to the same condition, the condition\nthat the plaintiff suit was brought in bad faith and for\npurpose of harassment.\nGRC suggests that the reading -- that the\nstatute the Justice mentioned -- benefits plaintiffs.\nBut what Congress wanted to do here -- I mean, would\nbenefit plaintiff -- what Congress wanted to do was to\nhelp defendants. There's actually no legislative\nhistory about why this provision was put in there.\nWhat we have instead, for what it's worth,\nis a markup later where this provision is discussed in\nresponse to concerns that frivolous suits -- suits\nshould be deterred, and this provision, which is now\nalready in the statute, is discussed as one means of\ndeterring frivolous suits.\nBut the bad faith and harassment standard is\nthe dividing line that Congress drew between nuisance\nsuits and other suits. This case is clearly on the\nnon-nuisance side of the line, and cases on that side of\nthe line are not subject to an award of costs.\nIf the Court has no further questions?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would assume that, if\nRule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said\nsomething like, \"except as expressly repealed in another\nstatute,\" would what happened here meet that express\nrequirement of repeal? It was Justice Scalia's question\nto you, but reformulated in a different way.\nMS. ZIEVE: If Rule 54(d) incorporated a\nrequirement that a statute expressly referred to Rule\n54(d)?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Expressly repealed\n54(d).\nMS. ZIEVE: That would be a very different\ncase. But of course, Rule 54(d) doesn't do that.\nInstead, when Rule 54(d) was adopted, the Rules\nCommittee actually -- the advisory committee notes list\n25 statutes that it says will not be affected by the\nrule.\nThose are statutes that allow fees, forbid\nfees, condition fees, allow fees in a broader scope of\ncases than Rule 54(d) does. And, of course, none of\nthose would have mentioned Rule 54(d) because they\npreceded adoption of the rule.\nI would reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feigin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nRule 54(d) expressly codifies in absolute\nform the well-established principle that a specific\nprovision displaces a more general one. And I think\nthat principle is very helpful here in answering a\ncouple of the questions that have come up.\nFirst of all, it makes clear that no express\ntextual conflict is necessary. This Court's never\nrequired one, and the specific governs the general\ncases.\nThat's made even clearer, if you look at the\npre-2007 version of the rule, which is meant to be\nsubstantively identical to the current version of the\nrule -- this is at page 12 of the government's brief --\nand the original version of the rule said, \"Except when\nexpress provision therefore is made either in a statute\nof the United States or in these rules, costs shall be\nallowed as of course to the prevailing party, unless the\nCourt otherwise directs.\"\nI think that makes quite clear that\nwhen, as the FDCPA does, there is a specific statutory\nprovision that addresses an award of costs incident to\nthe judgment, that specific statutory provision prevails\nover the default rule that Rule 54(d) contains.\nAnother point about the specific governS\nthe general principle is it would apply here, even if\nthe Court believed that Section 1692k(a)(3) covered some\ntype of circumstances that Rule 54(d) and other things\ndon't.\nAnd that's made quite clear by this Court's\nrecent eight-Justice unanimous opinion in RadLAX Gateway\nHotel v. Amalgamated Bank, in which the Court said --\nand I quote -- \"We know of no authority for the\nproposition that the canon,\" -- they're talking about\nthe specific governs, the general canon -- \"is\nconfined to situations in which the entirety of the\nspecific provision is a\" -- quote -- \"'subset' of the\ngeneral one.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my problem with\nthis is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and\nthey have a good claim until I think you read the whole\nstatute. And I don't know what to say, other than the\nimpression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which\nis what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that\nthe winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get\nattorney's fees.\nYou know, it mentions costs, but that's the\nbackground rule. And then when you get to the second\nsentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith,\nthe plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees.\nIt doesn't really mention costs. That's the background\nrule.\nSo -- and I look at the legislative history,\nthere's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that\ninteresting; the -- they're talking about what the point\nof this is, and say the whole point of this section is\nto help prevent frivolous suits.\nWell, so there we are. That's -- that's\nwhere I am at this moment.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nit does expressly mention costs, both in the first and\nthe second sentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say, on some\ntechnical linguistic basis, it may do that, that's\ncorrect. But perhaps I'm unique in this, but I don't\njust look at the language, I look at the context, I look\nat the purpose, and -- and I don't see anything in the\nlanguage that gets rid of the background rule, and I\ndon't see anything in the purpose that gets rid of the\nbackground rule, and I don't see anything in the history\nthat gets rid of the background rule.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see anything in the\nconsequences that suggests that you get rid of the\nbackground rule. I don't see anything in our traditions\nthat says you should get rid of the background rule.\nSo what -- what do you do with some\nobstreperous judge who doesn't just look at the\nlanguage? I mean, I know who uses it, but that's not\nthe only thing.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, if Congress\nwere satisfied with the background rule, then I think\nit's strange that they added the words \"and costs\" to a\nsentence that is expressly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, why? A person who is a\ndrafter says -- you know, you get your costs and you\nalso get the attorney's fees. They don't -- they don't\nknow every statute, the people who draft this. They --\nthey -- they just say, Senator, what are we trying to\ndo? He says, we're trying to give them attorney's fees.\nThey say, okay, we'll give them the costs and the\nattorney's fees.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I think that gets\nback to Justice Ginsburg's question of why weren't they\njust saying \"and costs\" here, just to make clear that\nnot only fees would be available, but also costs. And I\nthink that's an implausible hypothesis of what Congress\nwas trying do for the following reason: A\ncongressperson who is concerned that a reference to fees\nalone in the second sentence of Section 1692k(a)(3)\nwould preclude application of the default rule in -- in\nRule 54(d), couldn't possibly have thought that the way\nto make clear that Rule 54(d) applies in full was to add\nthe words \"and costs\" in a sentence that's expressly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's if you had been\ndrafting it, perhaps. But the people who actually draft\nthese things are a whole section over in Congress, they\ndon't know every statute, and you give them a general\ninstruction.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the general\ninstruction would be add attorney's fees on the\nplaintiffs and add attorney -- Alright. You\nunderstand the point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we have to assume\nignorance of the drafter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, ignorance of other\nlaws.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a general principle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right, general\nignorance.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FEIGIN: Let me -- Your Honor, let me --\nlet me address that directly. If we're presume that\nCongress is aware of Rule 54(d), then I think it's quite\npeculiar and, in fact, quite counterproductive to have\nadded the words \"and costs\" to a sentence that's\nexpressly conditioned on a finding of bad faith and\npurpose of harassment.\nBut if I accept your hypothesis that\nCongress was not aware of Rule 54(d). Again, it's quite\nstrange that, when thinking about the cost-shifting rule\nthat should apply in FDCPA cases, what Congress decided\nto do was put the words \"and costs\" into a sentence\nthat's expressly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then they shouldn't\nhave put those words in. But we're talking about the next\nsentence. And the next sentence doesn't put the words\nin. So you're -- you're -- you're assuming from that\nfact that, in a pro defendant -- this is a pro-defendant\nprovision they put in, that was their whole point\napparently reading it -- that what they decided to do is\ntake away from defendant's costs, which they normally\nget, without saying anything about it.\nI mean, that's -- you understand the\nproblem.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, the words \"and\ncosts\" appear in both sentences. I agree with Ms.\nZieve, that the legislative history does not indicate\nthat this is a uniquely pro-defendant division --\nprovision, and that's what the Court found in Jerman.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't -- where does it\nsay that? Where was the --\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, first of all --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I would like to read it.\nMR. FEIGIN: -- you can look at -- there is\nno legislative history directly addressing the sentence\nwe're trying to interpret today. But I think, if you\nlook at the Court's opinion in Jerman and the hearing\ncited at page 31 of the red brief, it reflects that\nCongress was trying to balance deterrence of nuisance\nsuits and incentivizing good-faith consumer enforcement.\nIf I could, I would like to address the\npolicy reasons why Congress would have found it\nparticularly useful not to have plaintiffs pay costs in\nthese circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a\npretty odd way to balance. I mean, if you're -- if\nyou're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an\nidea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not\ngive them costs.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, the reason not to give --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very\ncurious way to dilute what was otherwise a\ndefendant-friendly provision.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think\nthe provision is uniquely defendant-friendly. I think\nit draws a dividing line between nuisance suits and\nnon-nuisance suits, premised on a finding of the suit\nbeing brought in bad faith and the purpose of\nharassment.\nAnd the reason why Congress thought it was\nnecessary to shield good-faith plaintiffs from costs\nhere in order to incentivize enforcement, is, first of\nall, these are particularly low-value suits, especially\nwhen compared to other statutes in the CCPA. They're\nthe kind of suits that can be incentivized by a mere\n$1,000 in statutory damages. And as this case\ndemonstrates, the cost of a suit, if taxed against the\nplaintiff, can do much more than 1,000 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you look up -- did you\ntry to do any sampling on that? Because I did,\nactually, and -- and I discovered something that I think\nis not as strong for you, but it isn't too much against\nyou.\nWe just did a random sample of 28 successful\ncases, and I think the average recovery -- except for\none outlier, where it was very high, -it was around\n$4,000 -- 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that\nthe defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand. So\nyou have a point --\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it isn't quite as good\na point, as you seem to suggest. That is, it's a not so\nlow value and the costs are not so high --\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, plaintiffs --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in order to make it.\nMR. FEIGIN: Plaintiffs here are uniquely likely to\nbe deterred because they're the kind of people who have\nbeen pursued by debt collectors. They're going to be in\ndebt themselves. They're not going to be able to pay\ncosts. That's why attorneys -- and that's why the\nstatute provides for attorneys generally to take these\ncases on contingency, on the hope that they'll recover\nfees when the plaintiff is successful.\nNow, if plaintiff's looking to bring this\nkind of case, the only out-of-pocket expense the\nplaintiff is facing is the potential that if it loses\nthe case for some reason that it can't be aware of\ninitially, such as a bona fide good-faith defense or the\nlaw being interpreted against them in an area where the\nlaw is unclear, they're going to have to pay out of\npocket against the plaintiff himself, not the\nplaintiff's attorney, who are the people the defendant\nclaims is -- are responsible for the abuses they allege\nin FDCPA cases. This is going to come out via judgment\ndirectly against the plaintiff.\nIt's difficult to believe that Congress\nenacted a provision specifically because it believed\nthe -- the debt collection industry was forcing, among\nother things, personal bankruptcies and wanted the kind\nof plaintiffs who were going to be in a position to\nenforce the FDCPA to have to face the risk of incurring\nthousands of dollars in costs if they lose a suit that\nthey bring in good faith.\nAnd the reason --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I to understand your\nsimple position to be that what Rule 54(d) does -- says\nis if another provision deals with costs, you're\nrelegated to that other provision?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless, and this --\nyou're inverting the express -- unless that provision\nrefers you back to 54?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, no, Your Honor, I'd\nqualify that a little bit. I think what -- we just\nthink it codifies an absolute form of the\nspecific governs the general principles.\nSo the first question you asked is whether\nthey're covering the same territory, and they are here.\nBoth 1692k(a)(3) and 54(d) cover awards of costs\nincident to the judgment.\nThe second question you asked is the scope\nof the displacement. So it's possible that you might\nhave a provision, as the first sentence of 1692k(a)(3)\ndoes, that only governs in certain circumstances and\nmandates an award of costs in those circumstances.\nWe don't think a sentence like that,\nstanding alone, would displace a court's discretionary\nauthority under Rule 54(d) to award costs in other\ncircumstances. But we don't think there's any need --\nmay I finish the sentence, Your Honor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish that\nsentence.\nMR. FEIGIN: We don't think there's any need\nto adopt some new special rule for Rule 54(d) that's\ndifferent from how this Court normally applies the specific\ngoverns the general principle.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nOur position is that the second sentence of\nsection 1692k(a)(3) is a pro-defendant provision that\ndoes not strip courts of their discretion under Rule 54\nto award costs to prevailing defendants. We think that\nfirst because of the text and structure and, second,\nbecause of the statutory history and purpose.\nAs to the text, the second sentence states\nthat a court may award an affirmative grant of power,\nrather than the court may award attorney's fees and\ncosts if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in bad faith. The\ntext doesn't say that a court may not award costs in the\nabsence of bad faith. The text doesn't say or even\naddress a court's discretion to award costs to\nprevailing defendants as an ordinary incident of defeat.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to\nme that the -- the most natural way to read this\nstatute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look,\nwe have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that --\nthat contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't\nwrite -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without\nproviding a cost provision.\nAnd because we know that about Congress, we\nprovide a default rule. And the default rule is what's\nlaid out in subsection (d) as to costs and then also\nlater as to attorney's fees.\nBut, we know that Congress sometimes does\naddress costs and fees, and where Congress in a\nparticular statute has addressed costs and fees, we look\nto whatever Congress has said -- you know, unless\nCongress has otherwise provided. And here, this is --\n1692k is a provision that addresses costs and fees. It\naddresses them comprehensively and specifically.\nMS. BLATT: Yes. I disagree with everything\nyou said for the following reasons --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I expected you might.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: This is not a field preemption\ncase. Rule --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a question of field\npreemption.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, it is. You're saying that\nif it addresses costs, that it trumps it. And it is\na -- you would never think -- this -- Rule 54 doesn't\nsay, don't award costs if a statute can be plausibly\nread to address it. It says, unless it provides\notherwise, which means Congress actually intended to\ndisplace.\nAnd unless you actually think that this\nprovision intends to take away a cost authority --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe I'm --\nMS. BLATT: -- you don't get there.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- not in the business of\ntrying to figure out what Congress's intent is. All I'm\ntrying to figure out is whether this Federal statute\nprovides otherwise, and this Federal statute does\nprovide otherwise.\nMS. BLATT: Okay. Here's why it doesn't:\nIt doesn't displace it. It doesn't in terms of the\nplain text. It just doesn't. It doesn't say any --\nthere's no disabling aspect about it. It's an\naffirmative grant to protect a defendant. And when you\nsay to a court it has sanctioning power to award\nattorney's fees and costs, that doesn't say anything\nabout what happens in the ordinary case, where the\ndefendant has prevailed at trial and been found to be\ncompletely innocent.\nThere --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in that respect, it\nis different from RadLAX, in which the two provisions -\nwhere we held the specific covers the general -- but we\nheld that because the two provisions contradicted each\nother.\nMS. BLATT: Not only do they not contradict,\nthis is not a specific -- when you said -- the other\nthing I disagreed with, when you said this\ncomprehensively addresses costs, no, this\ncomprehensively is about attorney's fees.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's both, you know?\nMS. BLATT: It is --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And if I might say, I mean,\nyou object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to\nsay Congress should have written a separate provision\nabout costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad,\ngood, or indifferent reason, Congress didn't, and so\nthis statute basically says, here's what prevailing\nplaintiffs get as to both costs and fees, here is what\nprevailing defendants get --\nMS. BLATT: That's not correct. It doesn't\nmention prevailing --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- under what circumstances,\nas to both costs and fees, and those are the rules.\nMS. BLATT: Yes. Unlike -- unlike the whole\nstatute that talks about prevailing plaintiffs, this\ndoesn't. What is fascinating about this case is, in all\n50 titles of the U.S. Code, there are specific\nprovisions that say, plaintiffs shall not be liable for\ncosts, or a plaintiff shall not be liable for costs\nunless a certain condition occurs.\nThere's only one statute -- we looked at all\n50 titles -- there is one statute that says, a court may\naward costs if a certain condition occurs. That's\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By all 50 titles,\nyou don't mean each title, do you?\nMS. BLATT: We've -- we've looked for all,\nwe've looked at all the cost provisions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean, like in\nTitle IX --\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And Title XI?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. That's what's so funny\nabout this. Nothing in this -- this case -- I don't\nmean to trivialize it, but there's only one other\nstatute, that Electronic Fund Transfers Act, that talks\nabout the court shall award attorney's fees and costs if\nthere is bad faith.\nAnd there is one other statute that says,\nfor a prevailing defendant, the court may award costs if\nthe lawsuit is frivolous. And in those three\nsignificant ways, I think it shows why we win, and\nthat's a statute they relied on to say it's just like\nour statute, on page 18 of their brief, page 29 of our\nbrief.\nFirst, it only refers to costs. The statute\nis about costs. Our statute is about attorney's fees\nbeing the main event upon a finding of bad faith.\nSecond, it mentions prevailing defendants;\nours doesn't.\nAnd, third, which I think is missing from\nthe entire 30 minutes that you heard, their argument is\nplaintiff -- Congress sat down and wanted to incentivize\nfrivolous suits and nonfrivolous -- nonfrivolous suits\nalike. At least in the Pipeline Safety Act, Congress\nsaid, if it's frivolous, the defendant gets its costs.\nHere --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: This statute is very -- is\nvery normal if it were just about fees, right? It would\nbe just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it\nsaid prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing\ndefendants only get fees upon some higher standard,\nhere, bad faith. What makes this statute different --\nand it is different -- is that this statute twice says\nnot only fees, but also costs.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Now, you might say that's\nvery uncommon, but in both sentences, it says, we want\nthe same rule for costs as we do for fees.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I mean, a couple things\nabout that, it's both very common -- fee shifting\nprovisions routinely refer to both fees and costs, just\nlike salt and pepper, peanut butter and jelly, they go\ntogether as a set.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And with that, is that\nthere are some statutes that don't?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not always\npeanut butter and jelly.\nMS. BLATT: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's peanut butter and\nhoney sometimes.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: Yes. And here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Love and marriage.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: I don't know about that one.\nBut here -- here, I think Congress -- first\nof all, it's just wrong that the reference to \"and\ncosts\" is grammatically inexplicable and devoid of\npractical function; and that is the fundamental point of\nthe blue brief, that this is just grammatically\ninexplicable, and that's just not true.\nWhat \"and costs\" does is it -- basically,\nthe word \"and\" is being used to mean \"in addition to.\"\n\"And\" means \"in addition to.\" And so what Congress is\nsaying is, when courts fee shift -- attorney's fee shift\nupon a finding of bad faith, courts additionally may award\ncosts in addition to and over and above the attorney's\nfees that were measured in relationship to the work\nperformed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you're right. What\nabout their policy argument here, that you're a --\nyou're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of\nmoney, you don't have a lot of money, and the deal is\nthis, under your interpretation, if you win, you're\ngoing to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose, it will cost you\nabout a thousand.\nThat's -- that's under your interpretation.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And under theirs, it's if\nyou win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least\nyou don't lose anything.\nMS. BLATT: Yes. I think their policy\nargument is -- I mean, it could not be worse. A\nhomeless person -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it could be worse.\nMS. BLATT: No, it couldn't be worse, and\nhere's why: A homeless person filing a civil rights\ncase has to pay costs, and at least that person has to\npay -- has to prove damages. This plaintiff gets $1,000\nfor free. Second of all, the plaintiff in this case\nnever asks for relief. Well, 54 is discretionary. If\nthis woman was in pain and suffering, why didn't she\nsay, district court, I can't afford this?\nIt is the law in every circuit that the\ndistrict courts don't have to award costs. It's just\ndiscretionary. So Rule 54 has a built-in safety valve;\nit accommodates all the policy concerns on the other\nside, and every other informal paupers litigant, every other\nconsumer protection plaintiff, every civil rights plaintiff,\nevery plaintiff in the country faces the risk of a cost\naward, but doesn't get $1,000 thrown in for free.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, we do have in\nthis case the views of the government regulators, the\nFTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we\nhave heard the government's position on the relationship\nbetween these two provisions. Should we give any weight\nto the interpretation of the government administrators?\nMS. BLATT: Obviously not. I don't even\nknow where they would get a basis for deference. I'm\nsorry --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have a lot of cases that\nsay that -- that the agency's views about what courts\nshould do are not entitled to deference. This is --\nthis is a matter --\nMS. BLATT: Yeah, but that would be\nLedbetter, and I don't want to cite that to Justice\nGinsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: So I think the better answer is\nwhat's so mystifying about their policy argument is that\nthey enforce -- they enforce 20 consumer protection\nstatutes, and all of them, their -- their plaintiffs\nhave to pay costs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what about the -- how\ndoes this work, the canon? I'm very interested.\nMS. BLATT: They're --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm very interested in\ncanons, and I want to know on the canon, the traditional\nthing, which you've probably looked up, what about the\nspecific governs the general? Is it -- how is that --\nthat's an old canon that's been around a long time, and\npeople are aware of it. And that's --\nMS. BLATT: Well, I'm happy to go canon to\ncanon.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is -- it seems to be\nthe one they feel is very important.\nMS. BLATT: That's the government. The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Well, that's what I'm\ninterested in.\nMS. BLATT: Okay. Well, I don't think --\ncanons -- you know, don't trump common sense, context,\nhistory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that -- that's a\ndifferent matter.\nMS. BLATT: But let's go to canons. Let's\ngo to canons, specific versus the general. It's all\nword games. It turns on what you think \"specific\"\nmeans. This is not specific to the question presented\nabout prevailing parties and costs. This is about\nattorney's fees. That -- and costs are on top of\nattorney's fees, is essentially how --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you say that, but it\nsays to both. It says the costs, together with the\nreasonable attorney's fees, and then the next sentence,\nit says fees and costs. So you might wish that they\nwere a different statute, and it might be good policy to\nhave a different statute --\nMS. BLATT: I don't wish for a different\nstatute. I think what you're saying is that Congress\npassed a firewall. Congress said, we need to encourage\nfrivolous suits and nonfrivolous, but let's put a\nfirewall in and give them fees and costs, that, God\nforbid, there is bad faith and harassment.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not in the business --\nI'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly\nwhat Congress is doing. I'm in the business of just\nreading what Congress did. And what Congress did is it\ncreated a set of rules that applies to attorney's fees\nand costs at the same time.\nMS. BLATT: It -- it affirmatively gives\ndistrict courts emboldening power to sanction. So --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that sounds very\nterrible.\nMS. BLATT: But not if you file a lawsuit in\nbad faith and for purposes of harassment. So, I mean --\nI think even -- I think the history is obvious; this was\ntrying to make defendants better off than the\ndefendant's suit under the Truth in Lending Act, which\nis part of the same umbrella Consumer Credit Protection\nAct.\nAnd they're -- inexplicably, somehow, by\ntrying to make them better off, made them worse than\nevery other creditor that they serve and immunized these\nplaintiffs from the universal risk of cost shifting that\nevery other litigant has to face. And so -- and you\ndon't get there from -- all they have is a negative\ninference.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Blatt, you say\nit -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by\nfocusing on just part of the provision, but the\nprovision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things. It\ntreats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain\nset of ways. And it treats prevailing defendants in a\ncertain set of ways.\nMS. BLATT: It doesn't speak to prevailing\ndefendants.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Prevailing defendants, but\nwhen -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than\nprevailing plaintiffs because they have to show that\nthere is a bad-faith lawsuit.\nMS. BLATT: Yeah, I'm going -- I'm going to\nkeep repeating it because it's my position. This\ndoesn't -- the fact that this doesn't refer to\nprevailing defendants speaks volumes that what was not\non Congress' mind, was Rule 54. What was on Congress'\nmind is victimized debt collectors who were sued in bad\nfaith.\nNow, I understand this is a pro-plaintiff\nstatute, but this would be extraordinary to think that\nthey gave them attorney's fees when they -- but it's\nbasically saying -- this is a -- this is a defendant who\nwent to trial and won, was law-abiding, didn't do\nanything wrong, and Congress in that situation said, not\nonly might -- might not the suit be -- be -- have merit\nor good faith, it might have even been frivolous.\nWhen under Rule 54 -- again, this is what I\nfind so mystifying about this case. If the petitioner\nthought, oh, I had a really hard case in the law, or,\noh, I'm really poor, she could have asked for\ndiscretionary relief. Instead, the lawyer went into\ncourt and said, I have a recent Ninth Circuit decision,\nand I don't have to pay costs at all.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, let me try it a\ndifferent way.\nMS. BLATT: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Let's just suppose that\n54(k) didn't exist at all. Okay?\nMS. BLATT: 54(d)?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: 54(d) didn't exist.\nMS. BLATT: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And all you had was this\nprovision. Okay?\nMS. BLATT: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So this provision says, on a\nfinding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the\ncourt may award to the defendant attorney's fees and\ncosts. So suppose a defendant wins, but there's not a\nfinding that it was made in bad faith, would then the\nperson be entitled to either attorney's fees or costs?\nMS. BLATT: Well, we wouldn't -- certainly,\nwe sought costs here under Rule 54.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So I'm saying that --\nMS. BLATT: I know. Okay. And you've took\nit up. So that takes out my route seeking for costs\nunder Rule 54, it doesn't exist in your world.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In my world, you would not\nget fees or costs.\nMS. BLATT: Now, we would -- I'm imagining\nthen the world in 1936, and we rely on 1920 or 1919 or\nthe long-standing practice of courts awarding costs.\nNow, a court might --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm just asking you a simple\nquestion.\nMS. BLATT: We would not get costs under\nthis provision, you're correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You would not get costs\nunder that provision.\nMS. BLATT: Because this -- in that sense, I\nthink this was a question that another Justice asked.\nIf you just look at this provision, the only basis for\ncosts and fees in this provision is the bad faith and\nfinding of harassment.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So if you would not\nget costs under that provision --\nMS. BLATT: Under 1692.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- under 1692, a provision\nthat talks about fees and costs, generally, as to both\nplaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that\nsays what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal\nstatute provides otherwise change matters?\nMS. BLATT: Because -- because, again,\nRule 54 is not preemption -- a field preemption. It's\nsaying if Congress intended to displace -- the proviso,\nunless otherwise provided, it was recognition that other\nstatutes might displace Rule 54. And if you look at all\nthe statutes that we cite on pages 19 and 20, they\nactually do prohibit costs.\nAnd then if you look at the statutes on\npages 24 and 25, where, time and time again, Congress\nhas said, a prevailing party may recover attorney's fees\nand costs. Well, the \"and costs,\" in their view, I\nguess those statutes are inexplicable. I mean, it's\nclearly they're redundant, and they overlap with Rule\n54. They don't displace it.\nAnd even the practice guides that we cite on\npage 22, which is basically Wright and Miller and Moore,\nsay something that merely overlaps with Rule 54 doesn't\ndisplace the court's discretion.\nAnd again, I think you have to ask yourself,\nwhat was Congress doing? To me, this is -- this is a --\nthe attorney's fees are the main show, it goes with bad\nfaith. Congress was not thinking about Rule 54, and I\nthink you can be quite confident Congress was not\nthinking, we want plaintiff lawyers to go around saying,\nnot only Congress, but the government wanted us to file\nfrivolous suits.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You might be right, but\nsuppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54. Suppose\nit didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or\nwhat the default provision was. They just wrote a\nstatute about fees and costs. And then -- it doesn't\nreally matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54\nor not.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, if you -- right. And so\nthere's like that Oncale case, with same-sex harassment,\nCongress can write a very -- can write a plain language\nprovision, and regardless of what Congress intended, if\nthe language covers it, that's tough, we're going to\nconstrue it. That's your law.\nThis is not that. This -- this doesn't say\nanything about prevailing parties. This is talking\nabout bad faith and attorney's fees. It doesn't say a\ncourt can't act in the absence of bad faith. It doesn't\nsay anything about prevailing parties. It doesn't\nreveal any intent to displace it, especially when you\ncompare it with all the other statutes, you look at the\nhistory -- sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, it was thinking\nabout prevailing parties because the predecessor\nsentence --\nMS. BLATT: Prevailing defendants -- I\nagree, sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it was talking --\nno, prevailing parties. The provision is geared towards\nprevailing parties in some form. The first sentence\nsays, \"a prevailing plaintiff,\" not whether it's on a\nsubstantial basis or any exception.\nMS. BLATT: Yeah.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It says you get fees or\nyou can get fees and costs.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it then decides to\nlimit what a prevailing defendant can do. Isn't that\nthe natural reading?\nMS. BLATT: No, because it says expressly,\nin a case of successful action, it talks about\nprevailing plaintiffs. And then it says if there's --\nto me, it's just -- it's natural when you just read it\nin light of sort of common sense in context in what\nCongress was doing. If a plaintiff files in bad faith,\nthe court is empowered and emboldened -- it's like a\nneon light -- courts, you have authority to award\nattorney's fees and costs.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's -- that's just\na different way of saying the following: The first\nsentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you\nget costs and fees. How about defendants? Well,\nprevailing is not enough for defendants. Defendants\nhave to show --\nMS. BLATT: Yeah.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- that the suit was filed\nin bad faith --\nMS. BLATT: Yeah. And I think --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- and then they get costs\nand fees.\nMS. BLATT: Right. But I think you have to\nkeep this in mind, that there are completely\ndiametrically opposed background presumptions in our\nlegal system. It's an extraordinary event to get\nattorney's fees, and it's an extraordinary event not to\nget costs.\nAnd so the court -- the Congress has to use\nexplicit language to over -- overturn the American rule.\nAnd so what Congress did here, that is the most natural,\neven if I drew you to a tie --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I completely agree with\nthat. But that's what it comes down to, that if you\nthink that Congress has to use super extraordinary\nlanguage to over -- to -- to get out of 54(d), then\nyou're right. But 54(d) doesn't say that. It just\nsays --\nMS. BLATT: Right. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- unless the Federal\nstatute provides otherwise.\nMS. BLATT: And I think you can look -- the\nPetitioner did -- did a valiant job of trying to drudge\nup as many statutes as they can. All the statutes on\npoint are explicit. Now, there's one statute that might\nnot be, the pipeline safety one.\nAnd so the question is: Do we think that\nCongress actually tried to displace a court's authority\nunder that statute? And that's a statute that just says\na court may award costs if a lawsuit is frivolous. This\none just doesn't say that.\nYou at least -- even if you don't think of\nit as magic language or an explicit statement, the fact\nthat Congress repeatedly has used explicit language\ncasts considerable doubt that this was done by mere\nimplication.\nAnd then you look at the fact that it\ndoesn't mention prevailing parties. It's talking about\nbad faith, it has attorney's fees, what was Congress\ndoing, you look at the legislative history. It shows\nthat it was -- it was trying to make them, better, off\nthan a class of defendants, but their view inexplicably\nmakes them worse off.\nAnd then you look at the result that they're\nactually advocating, that the government thinks it's a\ngood idea that plaintiffs can file lawsuits cost-free\nthat are frivolous. I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess, in the first\nsentence of 3, the phrase \"the costs of the action\" is\nreally superfluous in light of 54(d)(1). You really\ndon't know that. I mean, that would have been the case\nanyway.\nSo there's no reason to think that it isn't\nfrivolous in the second sentence -- or superfluous in\nthe second sentence, right? Why did they have to say\nthe costs of the action in the case of a successful\naction?\nMS. BLATT: Successful action to enforce it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The costs of the action,\ntogether with a reasonable -- as determined by the\ncourt.\nMS. BLATT: Why isn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they have the costs\nanyway, if Congress didn't write anything, right?\nMS. BLATT: I mean, I think that -- again --\nI mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: Yeah, I know. And I was going\nto say there's so much is superfluity in here, I don't\nknow where to begin. It's all over the place. The\nwhole thing, obviously, overlaps with the Court's\ninherent authority.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that\nthere's a serious argument that the first sentence does\naway with the discretionary nature?\nMS. BLATT: No, it's clear, \"shall.\" It's\nclear \"shall,\" obviously. The first sentence does --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's a command.\n54(d) is permissive, according to your earlier argument?\nMS. BLATT: Oh, yes, that's right. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so this does -- it's\nnot superfluous because it went to mandatory?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gotcha.\nMS. BLATT: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well-taken.\nMS. BLATT: Yeah. The question, though,\nwas, in the case of any successful action when,\nobviously, they prevailed to begin with, so the question\nis whether that's superfluous. But the whole provision\noverlaps with the Court's inherent authority. And I\nknow it hasn't come up, but I just think it's strange\nthat it says, for the purposes of bad faith and\nharassment, Congress was obviously using belt and\nsuspenders there, so it's not surprising that Congress\nadded \"and costs\" here.\nIf you look at Rule 54 -- let me just say\none other thing, Justice Kagan -- if you look at Rule\n54, it also says, \"unless the statute provides\notherwise, costs other than attorney's fees.\" So why --\nthey didn't have to say that because, in the next\nprovision, it talks about attorney's fees. They just --\nthey wanted to make clear for whatever reason or maybe\nthey just wrote some really excess, redundant, silly\nlanguage, but they said costs, meaning anything that's\nnot costs -- it's just that Congress sometimes uses\nthese.\nAnd I guess this was the honey and peanut\nbutter thing, is that a lot of fee-shifting statutes\ntalk about both attorney's fees and costs. And so they\nwent together and -- they also mentioned it. Obviously,\nit's different. I agree that there's a verb in the\nfirst sentence that's mandatory, so it trumps Rule 54.\nBut with respect to the two objects,\nCongress was already thinking about attorney's fees and\ncosts anyway, and so there's nothing wrong with them\nsaying, in addition to the attorney's fees that you can\nget in bad faith, once you calculate the attorney's fees\nreasonable in relation to the work performed, you also\nget costs.\nAnd the only thing I would say is -- when we\ndefine \"and\" as in addition to, they seem to think that\nthat was an extraordinary reading of the word \"and,\"\nciting something -- from something called\ndictionary.com, and if you just went to dictionary.com,\nwhich I had not done before, and you type in \"and,\" the\nfirst definition is \"in addition to.\"\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Zieve, you have six minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ZIEVE: Thank you.\nFirst, the FDCPA doesn't just encourage\nfrivolous suits. Ms. Blatt repeatedly referred to\nplaintiffs getting a free $1,000. If the -- if the\nplaintiffs win their suits, that means both that they're\nnot frivolous and they're not in bad faith.\nIn cases that are frivolous, but a court\nmakes a finding that it's not in bad faith, defendants\nhave other means of recovering fees and costs using\nRule 11 or Section 1927. And there are cases in which\ncourts have denied fees and costs under the FDCPA and\ngranted them under Rule 11 or 1927.\nMs. Blatt suggested that --\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: Would you explain why we\nwould look to other rules? You wouldn't look at the\nRule 54(d), but we might look at Rule 11 and we might\nlook at something else? I thought your -- your position\nwas that this statute governs all requests for fees and\ncosts under this particular Act.\nMS. ZIEVE: Our position is that this\nprovision, k(a)(3), discusses the allocation of fees and\ncosts that come at the end of the case, based on who won\nand who lost. And if you read it as a whole, as I think\nJustice Kagan suggested, that's what Congress was doing.\nIt was carefully calibrating the allocation of fees and\ncosts at the end of the case. And, in fact, in\ninstances in which -- which defendants have asked for\nfees and costs in FDCPA cases based on bad faith, they\ndo always come at the end of the case, which also shows\nthis is not a misconduct provision.\nIf it were a misconduct provision, it\nwouldn't just be about bad faith in bringing the action.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act, for example, has a\nprovision that provides for fees, but not costs, that\nspeaks to conduct throughout the case, but with respect\nto bad faith filings of pleadings, motions, or other\npapers, that's a misconduct provision; this one isn't.\nThe main --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it -- isn't it the\ncase that, in order to appeal to the proposition that\nthe specific governs the general, you -- you have to\nread the second sentence of 3 as containing a\nnegative -- a negative implication? As saying --\nMS. ZIEVE: Yeah. We do read the \"court may\naward\" to mean \"and, in other circumstances, it may\nnot.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may not. So you are\nreading in a negative -\nMS. ZIEVE: Just as this Court -- just as\nthis Court read \"may\" in Cooper Industries or Crawford\nFittings and said, \"If you don't read 'may' to define\nthe scope of what Congress is authorizing the Court to\ndo, then that provision has no meaning.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I understood Ms. Blatt to\nactually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside,\nthis does say, you may, under a certain set of\nconditions, which implies you may not, under -- if those\nconditions are not met.\nMS. ZIEVE: Right. She did agree that,\nwithout Rule 54, this provision -- that -- that no costs\ncould be awarded to a defendant, unless they had acted\nin bad faith.\nI mean, I think, at some points, GRC and\nMs. Blatt here today asked you to just ignore that \"and\ncosts\" exists in the sentence at all, although the fact\nthat this sentence is not replicated numerous times\nthroughout the U.S. Code doesn't seem to me reason for\nignoring it, but, rather, for giving effect to it.\nCongress obviously thought it was doing\nsomething when it enacted this sentence and when it\nadded these words to the statute. It does not say, \"The\ncourt may award fees in addition to costs\" or \"as part\nof costs\" or \"together with costs.\"\nAgain, grammatically, it treats the two\nterms, \"fees and costs,\" on a par --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the\nwords \"and costs\" were left out in the second sentence?\nWould not the argument be made that you cannot award\ncosts even in an action brought in bad faith?\nWouldn't -- that this sum argument you're making --\nMS. ZIEVE: No, I don't think so. There\nare -- no. There are statutes that provide for fee\nawards and don't -- don't say anything about costs, and\nthese cases are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying \"negative\nimplication.\" If it -- if it says only \"attorney's fees\nin reasonable relation to the work expended,\" the\nimplication would be you --\nMS. ZIEVE: Justice Scalia, other --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you cannot -- you\ncannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award\ncosts. Wouldn't that be the reading of it?\nMS. ZIEVE: In other cases, under other\nstatutes, that argument has been made occasionally and\nrejected. It's also rejected in the treatises that we\ncite, that if you don't mention costs --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I'm suggesting if\nthat argument is rejected, so should yours be.\nMS. ZIEVE: No, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it seems the two\nare parallel.\nMS. ZIEVE: If the -- if the statute does\nnot mention costs, then it doesn't provide otherwise\nwith respect to costs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So she says if I -- if I\ntease -- if you tease your sister, I'm going to give\nyou -- give her your allowance and her allowance, that\nthat doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if\nyou don't tease her.\nI mean, there are a lot of instances --\nMS. ZIEVE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where you put the \"and\"\nin and it doesn't mean that that's the exclusive place\nfor giving it. Sometimes, it does; sometimes, it\ndoesn't. That's her point.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, put -- well, putting aside\nthat I hope that Congress drafts a little more carefully\nthan a mother may threaten her child --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I doubt that it does.\nI'm sorry. I mean, they're human beings over there;\nthey're not necessarily all --\nMS. ZIEVE: But they're -- the presumption\nbehind that hypothetical is that the one child is going\nto get their allowance no matter what. The presumption\nhere is that Rule 54(d) will apply unless a statute\nprovides otherwise. This statute doesn't.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
