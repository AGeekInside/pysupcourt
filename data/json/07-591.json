        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-591, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Crawford v. Washington, this Court made\nclear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a\nprotection against a system of trial by affidavit. It\nis an ancient procedural guarantee that requires the\nprosecution to prove its case through live witnesses who\ntestify before the jury and who are subject to\ncross-examination.\nIntroducing forensic laboratory reports,\nsuch as the certificates at issue in this case, is the\nmodern equivalent of trial by affidavit. The documents\nare sworn formal statements. They are crafted\npurposefully for the express purpose of proving a fact\nthat is an element of a criminal offense, and, as the\nState forthrightly admits in its brief, they are\nintroduced in lieu of having the analyst called as a\nwitness to the stand. They are therefore\nquintessentially testimonial evidence.\nMassachusetts --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say -- you say\n\"the analyst.\" I suppose it doesn't have to be the\nanalyst but whoever they decide to call. So if you had\na supervisor who runs the cocaine testing lab and he is\nthe one whose report is submitted, I take it he is the\none who would have to show up.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. Our position --\nour position is that whoever the Commonwealth wants to\nuse to prove the fact that they are trying to prove is\nthe person that needs to take the stand. In this case,\nit would be the analyst.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you would ask --\nif a supervisor did it, what would you ask the\nsupervisor? You'd say, you know, did you -- did you do\nthis? Can you testify to your own knowledge that this\nis what the analysis showed? And he would have to say,\nno, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can\ntell you he was a very reliable person. How would that\n-- I don't understand how that would work.\nMR. FISHER: I took the Chief Justice's\nhypothetical to be that the supervisor had actually done\nthe testing, but if the supervisor had not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. No. No,\nI'm saying that he would testify, I guess: I run the\nlab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to\ndo these tests, and this guy did the test. And since he\nwas the one that the Government decided to -- on whose\naffidavit they decided to rely, that's the only person\nyou could get.\nNow, you could -- to impeach him, you say,\nwell, did you do the test? No. But you say, well --\nbut I mean you don't have a right to an analyst at a\nparticular level.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. There is no\nsubstantive right. I think everything you've said is\nright as far as it goes. It just depends what the\nCommonwealth wants to put in in terms of evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose --\nMR. FISHER: If they want to put in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the tests were by\nJohn Smith, assistant lab technician, and you call John\nSmith, and you say, \"Is this your signature?\" \"Yes.\"\n\"Do you remember doing this test?\" And he says, \"I do\nthousands of tests. I don't remember. I'll tell you\nthe way I always do them.\" I mean, is that what you\nwant?\nMR. FISHER: Well, if that's what -- at a\nminimum, that's what we want, Justice Kennedy. This\nCourt has made clear in California --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's what you're\nusually going to get, isn't it?\nMR. FISHER: Well, we don't know what we are\ngoing to get. In some cases, unquestionably --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you know what you're\ngoing to get by looking, number one, at the States which\nallow this, where this happens all the time. You know\nwhat you're going to get in the States where the\ndefendant -- where the defense can subpoena the witness.\nNow, if there are new tests, complex DNA\ntests and so forth, I suppose there is a lot to ask\nabout. Standard blood alcohol, not much to ask about.\nMR. FISHER: But even in a test where the\nanalyst doesn't remember and, as you put it, it's a\nstandardized test, there are still plenty of questions\nthe defendant might want to ask, such as what test was\nperformed? We don't even know from the record what test\nwas performed in this case. What's the error rate on\nthat test? How do your protocols work? What are your\nexperience and credentials in analyzing those? There's\nplenty of questions the defendant might ask.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can raise all those\nquestions from the fact of the -- from the document.\nTell the jury, \"This doesn't show what tests were\nperformed.\" It's there on the document.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that's a choice\nthat defense counsel could make, as the defense counsel\nalways has a choice in a criminal case to decide whether\nto press the prosecution's evidence or to simply stay\nsilent and then later argue at closing the prosecution\nhasn't given you enough to prove the case.\nBut to the extent the Commonwealth is taking\nthe position that cross-examining would be fruitless in\na situation like this, the very basis of this Court's\nCrawford decision is that's not for courts to decide.\nIt is up to the defense counsel to -- if he wishes, to\ninsist on live testimony that he can cross-examine and\nthen --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then why -- why\nisn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the\ndefendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call\nthe analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse\nwitness?\nMR. FISHER: Well, three reasons, Justice\nGinsburg: First, if that were correct, then I don't see\nanything that would stop the prosecution in every\ncriminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits\non a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to\ncall whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them.\nBut even as a matter of text and structure\nof the Constitution, as a textual matter, the right to\nconfrontation is a passive right in the defendant's\nhands. It requires the prosecution to arrange for the\nconfrontation, and that's bolstered structurally by the\nCompulsory Process Clause. Remember, the Compulsory\nProcess Clause gives the defendant the very right that\nyou just explained, that the defendant can subpoena\nwitnesses into court and ask them questions. And surely\nthe Confrontation Clause adds something on top of that.\nAnd I think this Court's decision in Taylor\nagainst Illinois is the best explanation of the\ndifference between the two clauses. This Court said\nthat the Confrontation Clause arises simply by the\nnature of adversary proceedings, and it's a -- it's a\nrule that governs the way the prosecution must introduce\nits case. As I said at the opening here, it's a\nrequirement that the prosecution put its live witnesses\non the stand for the jury to observe them. The defense,\nof course, has the decision whether to cross-examine\nthose witnesses, or if witnesses are not called by the\nprosecution that he would wish to be part of the case,\nhe can subpoena them. But we would vigorously oppose\nany attempt to shift the burden on the defense to call\nwitnesses like this.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say that\nwhat they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that\nthat's all right?\nMR. FISHER: There is a variety of\nnotice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I\nthink the law professors' brief lays it out the best of\nwhat we have before you. We agree with the Solicitor\nGeneral that a plain notice-and-demand statute that\nrequires the defense to do nothing more than assert his\nright in advance of trial to have the prosecution put a\nlive witness on the stand would be constitutional, I\nthink, under this Court's jurisprudence. Under the\nCompulsory Process Clause, under the jury right, there\nare plenty of constitutional rights that, with fair\nnotice, a Defendant can be required to assert in advance\nof trial.\nNow, there are other types of statutes that\nother States call \"notice and demand\" that require\nsomething more of the defendant, whether it be that the\ndefendant himself call the witness, whether it be the\ndefendant himself make some kind of good faith or prima\nfacie showing in order to have the prosecution call the\nwitness. Those types of statutes, I think this Court,\nto the extent in this opinion it would mention\nnotice-and-demand statutes, it would want to be careful\nto leave for another day, because, again, we would agree\nwith the Solicitor General that those would raise more\ndifficult constitutional questions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your answer, you said,\nwell, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's\nall the State would have to do. I think, Mr. Fisher,\nthat was not quite responsive because the question here\nis whether or not there is an exception for business\nrecords. Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses,\nand so forth. We are talking about business records\ndone in the ordinary course.\nIt's true that it -- that the core principle\nis whether that confrontation is required, but the\nquestion is whether or not business records should be\ntreated as something that are not testimony because they\nare done based on other protocols with other procedures\nwhere there is substantial insulation from the facts of\nthe particular case because it's a routine scientific\nexercise.\nSo I think your answer, I would agree, is\nresponsive based on your theory of the case, but as a\nmatter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's\nbefore the Court, I don't think it addresses it.\nMR. FISHER: Okay. Thank you.\nI -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to\nbe asking whether giving the defendant the right to\nsubpoena the witness would be adequate under the\nConfrontation Clause if these documents were\ntestimonial.\nNow, your question is whether they might not\nbe testimonial at all viewed through the lens of whether\nthey are a business record.\nSo, as a historical matter, I think it's\nplain that no documents prepared in contemplation of\nlitigation were ever considered to be business records.\nAnd this Court's decision in Palmer v. Hoffman in 1943 I\nthink lays that out very, very clearly.\nSo there is no historical argument that\nbusiness records would fit -- would be exempted from the\ntestimonial rule as a class. And, of course, this Court\nsaid in Crawford v. Washington that even if a State\nunder a modern hearsay exception, whether it be a\nbusiness-record rule or in the State of Massachusetts's\ncase a special, brand-new hearsay rule -- just because\nthat might be okay in the run-of-the-mill cases doesn't\nexempt it from the right to confrontation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the railroad\ncase was an accident report. This is a scientific\nanalysis.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that is best\ncharacterized, with all due respect, as an argument for\nits reliability. And it may well be that judges and\njuries think that certain scientific processes yield\nmore reliable results in terms of reports and testimony\nand assertions. But we think, again -- and this Court's\ndecision in Crawford says quite strongly -- that a judge\ncannot decide just on the basis of reliability to exempt\na given record or a class of records from the\nConfrontation Clause.\nAnd I think, Justice Kennedy, another\nanalogy that makes it even more clear is police reports.\nPolice reports, just like the lab report in this case,\nare -- are sworn documents created by public servants\nwho are sworn to tell the truth, sworn to find evidence\nwhether it exonerates, whether it incriminates, and to\nwrite up a report. And I don't think anyone has ever\nsuggested that police reports describing a crime scene\n-- for example, no matter how objective the facts\nrelayed, such as there is a blood stain on the carpet,\nthere is -- the door was wide open when I got there --\nthose kinds of assertions would be exempted from the\nConfrontation Clause.\nIt may well be that they are likely to be\ncorrect, that they are assertions of fact that can be\nverified, but we've never understood that to fall\noutside of the ambit of the Confrontation Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you had what we can\ncall an independent lab, that certainly-- you certainly\ncan distinguish that from a police report. It's a\nline-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's\neasily distinguished.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think if you had -- in\ncontrast to this case, if you had a laboratory that was\na private lab being used by the police, that would raise\nthe question whether police agents who are private\nindividuals but -- but asked by the police to create\nsomething like this, would generate testimonial evidence\njust as well. And I think the answer would be yes.\nIn fact, in Davis this Court already\naddressed the situation, although it reserved in the\nfootnote, but it assumed that the 911 operator in that\ncase, who was a private individual working for a private\ncompany hired by the -- by the police --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, how many States\ndo things the way -- the way you would have them done?\nI mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice\nlaws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the\ninformation?\nMR. FISHER: Well, let me give you a few\ncategories, Justice Scalia.\nThere are six States, it is our\nunderstanding, including big populous States like\nCalifornia, Illinois and Georgia, that have no special\nhearsay law whatsoever, that bring in witnesses if\ndefendants demand it.\nThere is another category of States --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they bring in\nwitnesses if -- if defendants demand, but --\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry, I misspoke. I\nmisspoke. That in the ordinary course need to bring in\nwitnesses. Now, that was --getting ahead to my next --\nmy next category, there are at least nine or ten other\nStates that have the kind of bland notice-and-demand\nregime that I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg. And\nso that's another category.\nAnd then you have -- since Crawford there is\nanother, I believe, five additional States where their\nState supreme courts have held that Crawford applies to\nlab reports like this. So at least for the past couple\nof years they have been doing it the way that we would\nurge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I wonder -- and correct me\nif I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case\nstrongly enough with reference to California. I thought\nCalifornia followed the rule that you advocate here.\nMR. FISHER: That's what I meant to say if I\ndidn't say it that way. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else? I\n-- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I\ncan't find anything in the history that suggest lab\nreports would be admitted because they would be\nconsidered being prepared for trial. But business\nrecords are kept out.\nSo we have here a source that's unlikely to\nbe particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts\nlabs. And we have the checks of the discipline, the\nscientific discipline. On the other hand, it's being\nprepared for this trial.\nSo it seems to me some things go one way;\nsome things go the other way. I don't know exactly what\nthe predominant things are. That's what I'd like you to\naddress as much as possible.\nAnd when I look at the definition of\n\"business records hearsay exception\" today, it seems to\nme that the \"hearsay exception\" does cover today some of\nthe things under \"business records\" that would be\nprepared particularly for trial. You could have a\ncompany that goes and measures lines on the street, or\ntread marks, or a variety of things. And I guess they\ncome in under the \"business records exception.\" Do\nthey? I mean, is that right?\nMR. FISHER: They might, Justice Breyer, and\nI'd -- I'd be willing to assume for purposes of argument\nthat they would. But to the extent that they would be\noffered by the prosecution in a criminal case, the fact\nthat they were a business record would not answer the\nconfrontation question as to whether --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course, it\nwouldn't.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's why -- and maybe\nyou have nothing else you want to say on this point.\nIt's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.\nMR. FISHER: I think I do, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems like there are\nsome things going one way, and some things going the\nother on the issue of whether to call it \"testimonial.\"\nMR. FISHER: But I do want to -- with all\nrespect, I did want to add something to what you said\nabout the rigors of the lab or of science. It may well\nbe that those add to the truth, the reliability of\nreports. Let me say two things about that.\nFirst of all, the Confrontation Clause\ndoesn't exempt bishops and nuns, or -- or anyone who we\nknow or who we would think just as well would obviously\nbe telling the truth. It's, again, for the defendant to\ndecide and not for the court to decide whether\ncross-examination would be useful.\nBut let me add to that, Justice Breyer, that\nthe Innocence Project brief in this case and plenty of\nother sources widely available I think very, very, very\npersuasively explain that lab reports are not quite as\nreliable as we might want to think they are, and not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There have been bad\ninstances. You are absolutely right.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what I'm trying\nto work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened\nin the year 1084. I'd -- I'd be quite interested in\nyour views on what's a workable rule. And when I look\nacross the country on this, it seems most States have\nworked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to\ncall the witness if he wants. There is not a particular\nunfairness to that. If he can get ahold of the witness,\nno problem. But they said: We are not going to make\nthe State do this because it's a waste of time, for the\nmost part. It just delays the trial, and there is\nreally nothing at issue.\nMR. FISHER: Well, to the extent that is the\nprominent practice, it's one that grew up under this\nCourt's Roberts jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true.\nMR. FISHER: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if I assume -- I'm\nreally uncertain as to whether it has covered\n\"testimonial\" or not. And also, I'm not enamored\nparticularly of seeing on a close question what happened\nin ancient history.\nMR. FISHER: I understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there\nanything else you want to add to me on those\nassumptions?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, that -- that, again, it is\n-- it is not for the court; it's for the defendant to\ndecide. We think the definition of \"testimonial\"\ngenerally speaking ought to be that when a document is\nprepared in contemplation of prosecution, or more\nspecifically in this case to prove a fact that is an\nelement of a criminal case, because that's what these\nreports say, then they should fall under the\nConfrontation Clause.\nAnd to the extent that these are in some\nrealms and in some places reliable pieces of evidence,\nthere is every reason to believe it's not going to cause\nany problem, because defendants aren't going to want to\nchallenge them very often. If you look at the\nstatistics in the law professors' brief, they say in\nStates like California that -- first of all, we have a\nhuge category of cases that go away in plea bargains.\nAnd then even within the category of cases that go to\ntrial, it's 10 percent of the time or less --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a good defense\nlawyer would love to have the guy there. The first\nthing you say is: Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's\nsample? The guy is going to say no. Just as was\npointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples.\nWell, how long have you been working with the lab? You\nknow, just what -- what was your scientific background?\nWhen did you -- how does this test work? You put three\ndrops of the acid in there. It turns color, whatever it\ndoes. How do you know that? What is the chemical? I\nmean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury\njust doesn't think there is anything to the case at all.\nMR. FISHER: Well, the best I can do to\nanswer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is to say that\nempirically apparently that just doesn't happen. And I\nthink the reason why is explained in some of the defense\nmanuals that we have cited in our brief, which say that\nif your theory of the case has nothing to do with\nwhether the scientific report being introduced by the\nprosecution is correct or not, very often the defense\nisn't going to do itself any favors by -- by insisting\nthat that person take the stand, recite his credentials,\nrecite the testing, and recite the damning evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does that fact support\n-- why does that fact support your argument, that in all\nof those cases you're arguing for what's going to be an\nempty exercise?\nMR. FISHER: No, I would very much resist\nthat it will always be an empty exercise.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. But in -- in the\ninstance where the defendant doesn't think it would be\nworthwhile to subpoena the -- the recordkeeper, the\nperson who performed the test, but simply wants to put\nthe prosecution through the effort of getting the person\nthere to testify, it's -- what is achieved?\nMR. FISHER: Well, as I said, I think that\nthrough notice-and-demand regimes and stipulations,\noften that is not going to happen. But if it is\nachieved, what is achieved is the same thing that is\nachieved in any criminal trial where a defendant insists\nperiodically that the prosecution be put to its proof.\nAfter all, we are talking about putting\nsomebody away for many years in a typical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I absolutely see that\npoint. So that - all right, go back to the plea\nbargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a\nlittle nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining\nsystem as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge,\nthe prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense\nbar would like to have an added weapon, and this added\nweapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to\ninsist that you call these people. You don't even know\nwhere they are. I'm not going to accept the lab report.\nAnd then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement\nor maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place\nbecause he thought you would say something like that.\nSo I'm not -- is there anything you can say\nabout how this works in the presence of plea bargaining?\nDo we know any -- do we have any information on that?\nMR. FISHER: I don't know of any empirical\nstudy where you might say what the price of this is. Of\ncourse, it happens already every day with other\nwitnesses. You're going to have to bring in other\nwitnesses, and this is one more witness. But again,\neven in a case where that's all that's going on, it's no\ndifferent than all the other legal rights the defendant\nhas.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure it's one more\nwitness. Labs are backed up with DNA. You know, the\nFederal budget for the courts, for the Federal courts,\nis $6 billion. Well, $1 billion of that is spent under\nthe Criminal Justice Act for experts and translators and\ncounsels. This -- this is a very, very substantial\nburden if we tell every State in the country that\nevery -- in every drug case you are -- the State must\nproduce the expert.\nMR. FISHER: Remember, Justice Kennedy,\nthat -- that if you look at the States where this\nexists, that's not what happens and that's not what we\nare insisting on. All we are insisting is that the\nprosecution in a case where the defendant demands it,\nwhether it be through a notice and demand regime or\nwhether it be because the prosecution simply calls the\ndefense on the phone two weeks before trial and says,\nI'd like to do this through documentary evidence -- and\nthen these repeat players remember who -- who -- one\nthing I think it's worth keeping in mind in all this, is\nthat in the criminal justice system, by and large,\nespecially in drug cases like this, we are talking about\nrepeat players.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about\nthe defendants or the lawyers?\nMR. FISHER: I'm talking about the\nlawyers --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: -- by and large, Your Honor.\nThey have every -- they have incentives not to, as you\nmight say, yank the chain of the other side.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, I am interested\nin the history since that's what the Court held in\nCrawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause\nis not what we would like it to be, but what it\nhistorically was when it was enshrined in the\nConstitution. As a matter of history, was there a\nbusiness records exception, not from the hearsay rule\nbut from the Confrontation Clause?\nMR. FISHER: Not that I'm aware of. The\nbest -- the best source that I believe exists is the\nWigmore treatise, which both sides have cited. It says\nthere was a shop-book rule that allowed shop-book\nledgers and entries at the common law. But there is\nno -- there's no suggestion that that was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a business\nrecords exception? I don't --\nMR. FISHER: It is a business records\nexception, but it's not an exception to the right to\nconfrontation because no one would have considered\nordinary business records created without contemplation\nof litigation to be -- to be testimonial evidence. What\nwe have here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, wait. You say it's --\nthat business records would often or usually not be\ntestimonial?\nMR. FISHER: I think all of the business\nrecords that were admissible at the time of the founding\nwould have been nontestimonial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would have been\nnontestimonial. So they'd come in on that basis, not\nbecause they were business records?\nMR. FISHER: In a criminal case -- well, the\ntypical regime -- and I'm going to assume that it exists\nat the time of founding, but you need some evidentiary\nrule to get a piece of evidence in in the first place,\nwhether it be business records or whether it be just an\nordinary rule of relevance. But, yes, they would have\nbeen admissible at the time of -- ordinary business\nrecord like a shop book would have been admissible at\nthe time of the founding, but would have not raised a\nconfrontation problem even in a criminal cause because\nit would have been nontestimonial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, I just want to\nbe about -- clear about one thing. We are talking about\ndrug cases primarily. But the rule that we are fighting\nabout is not limited to drugs. Doesn't it apply to\nlaboratory reports on DNA, blood tests, all sorts of\nevidence? Isn't that correct?\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Stevens.\nAnd you can you look at the Massachusetts own decisions.\nThe State courts in Massachusetts already extended their\nrule in their day to ballistics tests, for example,\nwhich are notoriously unreliable in terms of empirical\nstudies that have been -- that have been conducted about\nthem. And my understanding -- I think you're right --\nis that nothing in the Commonwealth's rule distinguishes\none kind of forensic report from another.\nThe United States is offering a slightly\ndifferent analysis that appears to ask, to some degree,\nthe degree of interpretation involved in a given\nforensic laboratory report. I don't know how you would\nadminister that rule, but I can say that to whatever\nextent interpretation would be required, this is clearly\non the interpretive side of the ledger.\nAnd again, if I could point the Court to a\nsource for that, the Scientific Evidence treatise by\nGiannelli and Imwinkelried that the both parties cite at\nsection 23.030(c) lays out the mass spectrometry way of\ntesting for drugs that the Commonwealth tells you was\nthe test used in this case and describes in great detail\nthe amount of expertise, care, skill and interpretive\nmethods that need to be brought in that kind of a test.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that\nthis was prepared in contemplation of litigation? I\nmean, let's suppose the lab occasionally does analyses\nfor other -- research purposes. They get a sample, they\nwant to know what it's -- they want to test it, however\nthey do it. Are we just assuming that it's prepared in\ncontemplation of litigation because it usually is, or --\nyou can imagine a situation where the analyst really has\nno idea, other than perhaps supposition, why he is being\nasked to test the sample.\nMR. FISHER: The easiest answer in this\ncase, Mr. Chief Justice, is it's required by\nMassachusetts law that -- that these tests be done in\ncontemplation of prosecution. The law itself says that\nthe police officer can give it to an analyst, and the\nanalyst can certify a report if it's to be used for law\nenforcement purposes. So there is a statutory\nrequirement. Now, you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the question\nis it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for\nthe police to use and educational programs that want the\nrookies to know what the cocaine looks like.\nMR. FISHER: Well, to the degree it's not\nanswer ed in this case by statute, undoubtedly this\nCourt as it works through this jurisprudence will need\nto ask a question of common sense, whether the actors\ninvolved -- as this Court did in Davis -- whether the\nactors involved would understand what they are doing is\ncreating evidence for a criminal case?\nIf there are no more questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- I'm sorry. Go\nahead.\nMR. FISHER: Okay. I'll reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I just ask,\nyou would extend this to a -- a breath test, a blood\ntest, fingerprints, urinalysis? All of those would be\ncovered by your position?\nMR. FISHER: To the extent that the\nprosecution wanted to introduce a report certifying a\nreporting result of a test, yes, it would be covered by\nours.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you answered the\nquestion that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate\nsubstitute for the analyst. But suppose the lab says:\nWe are very busy in this place; could we schedule a\ndeposition; we'll present the analyst at a time mutually\nagreeable to both sides, rather than have the analyst on\nthe hook to show up on a trial date?\nMR. FISHER: That would work to preserve the\nevidence in case the analyst became unavailable at the\ntime of trial. And then under this Court's\njurisprudence that deposition would be admissible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But only if the analyst\nwasn't there on the day of trial?\nMR. FISHER: Then you -- then I don't think\nit would substitute for live testimony.\nBut let me say one other way that this\nproblem can be addressed by States is that they could\nhave a supervisor take the stand and rely on raw data --\non raw data and give his or her explanation of raw data.\nIt's just that the person cannot take the stand and\nrelay somebody else's conclusion to the jury.\nAnd if there are no more questions, I'll\nreserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher. We'll give you your full rebuttal time.\nGeneral Coakley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTHA COAKLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe drug analysis certificates at issue in\nthis case are not testimonial statements that have been\ncovered by the Confrontation Clause. That is, they are\nnot the statement of a percipient witness who has\nobserved past behavior of the defendant.\nIndeed, what they are are official records\nof objective identified -- it's independently verifiable\nfacts that are -- that were admissible at common law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is your answer to\nMr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours\nis -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case,\nthe State can put in its entire case by -- in a\ncircumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and,\nin effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying,\nwell, you can call the witness as part of the defense\ncase and cross-examine there?\nMS. COAKLEY: Because clearly, the kinds of\naffidavits that are the subject of Confrontation Clause\nanalysis could not be submitted by that. I think this\nis an exception to that. And so --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then that's what you\nhave got to explain to me. Why is it an exception?\nMS. COAKLEY: Because first of all, although\nthe Court has not addressed it so far with Mr. Fisher,\nthese are really not testimonial statements. None of\nthe cases that have dealt with Confrontation Clause\nanalysis -- before Ohio, through Ohio, through in fact\nGiles -- deal with the kind of statement that we are\ntalking about here. It's really a report of a scientist\ntest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the -- the\nblue car going down the street statement? In a\ncircumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and\nsays yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10\no'clock. Is that testimonial?\nMS. COAKLEY: It is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the distinction between\nthat and the lab report saying the substance that was\nshown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the --\nwhat's the distinction?\nMS. COAKLEY: In the first instance you have\na witness to an event in a particular case that can be\ntied to, perhaps, behavior of the defendant that's\ndeemed to be criminal. It's -- it's classic hearsay and\nsubject to confrontation, if it's, you know, is going to\nbe used by the prosecution.\nIn this instance, though, we have a protocol\nset up by a State statute that indeed does test\nsubstances other than those definitely headed for\nlitigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the difference\nbetween the two. I mean, the one, he saw the blue car\ngoing down the street, which through other evidence can\nbe connected to the defendant; and here the witness says\nthis is cocaine, which through other evidence is going\nto be connected to the defendant. And in both cases\nthat -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the\nprosecution for the conviction. I don't see the\ndifference between the two.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, I think there are\nseveral differences, Your Honor, but one of which is\nthat it is identifiable and it can be verified outside\nof what the scope of the Confrontation Clause is. In\nother words, the defendant has a chance to test it ahead\nof time, have his own independent witness. This doesn't\nchange. Whether it is cocaine before, during or after\nthe trial is testable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why --\nMS. COAKLEY: And it's not true of a witness\nstatement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why does that make a\ndifference? In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said\na moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the\nblue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by\nanother witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I\nheard the gun go off there was a blue car there. In\nthis case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the\ncocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has\ntestified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of\nthe defendant.\nThere is -- there is a temporal and physical\npath worked out in both cases. And it seems to me your\nattempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal\npath can be extended by one more step in the cocaine\ncase because you can take the cocaine or take something\nfrom the cocaine sample and let the defense expert\ntestify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see\nwhat that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or\nthe definition of testimonial evidence.\nMS. COAKLEY: I -- I think that that's\nsignificant, Your Honor, because it can be tested and\nverified and isn't dependent upon a cross examination at\ntrial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't you really\nsaying that the confrontation right is therefore not so\nimportant because you have a greater opportunity in the\ncocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting\nevidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found.\nIn other words, if -- if -- if the State's\nwitness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving\nhim wrong than in the blue car case. But if that is\nyour argument, I don't see what it's got to do with --\nwith the basic confrontation right.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think I go back, Your\nHonor, to looking at all the kinds of statements that\nthis Court has looked at within the scope of the\nConfrontation Clause. This kind of public record,\nofficial record, laboratory report, has never been the\nsubject of this kind of analysis and indeed it's not\nsufficient.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, have we ever had --\nhave we ever had a -- a kind of lab report, public\nrecord kind of case in -- in which the record was\nprepared expressly for trial?\nMS. COAKLEY: I think that if you look at\nDutton, for instance, and the concurring opinion by\nJustice Harlan talking about laboratory reports deemed\nto be whatever the analysis was, a business record, that\nwould have been --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Justice Harlan did\nnot take the majority view. I mean you -- I don't know\nwhere you get authority for the proposition that the\npublic record prepared for the purpose of litigation\nwould have come in under the, in effect, the founding\nera -- or would have been outside the founding era\ndefinition of testimonial.\nMS. COAKLEY: Except the public record, for\ninstance of a coroner's result -- not the coroner's\nverdict that involves Marian-type depositions, but the\nresults of a coroner's verdict that says somebody is\ndead and this is the cause and manner and means of\ndeath -- would have been admissible at the time with --\nthat kind of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For the indictment, not --\nnot as -- not as independent evidence in the\nprosecution. It would form the basis for the\nindictment, as I understand what the history is. It\nwould not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the\njury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death\nwas thus and so.\nMR. FISHER: But autopsy results -- my\nunderstanding, Your Honor, is that autopsy results --\nagain not a coroner's verdict, which -- in the reply\nbrief we believe that counsel has conflated what would\nbe a verdict between the fact of an official record, an\nautopsy report of the death, manner and means of\ndeath -- have been and still admissible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me -- and tell\nme if this is not the way you want to argue. It seems\nto me to make your case you have to say of course this\nis hearsay; and the question is whether it's\ntestimonial.\nMS. COAKLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's not testimonial\nbecause these are laboratory protocols, subject to\nongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different\nfrom testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific\nto the case. That's the kind of framework of the\nargument you have to make.\nMS. COAKLEY: That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that as a result of\nthat it is not testimonial because \"testimonial\" is a\nlegal term that's subject to interpretation. I -- I\nguess that's the argument you're making and that you\nhave to make.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As I see it.\nMS. COAKLEY: And I think that that is\ncertainly consistent with the way in which this Court in\nlooking at the series of cases from Crawford since, have\nlooked at what a testimonial statement is. Admittedly,\nyou haven't addressed this kind of statement, and I\nwould argue because it doesn't fall within the principal\nevil that the Confrontation Clause is designed to\nprevent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course the problem was\nin -- I think it was Hammond was the companion case to\nDavid.\nMS. COAKLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the 911 call was\ndone for other -- really other purposes. It wasn't\ntestimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial.\nThis does seem more directed to trial, so then you have\nto tell us why even if it is, there are some independent\nguarantees of -- of reliability that means that we\nshould say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, I agree, Your Honor. I\nthink that you cannot pull one of these qualities out\nand say that because it's prepared in anticipation of\ntrial means that therefore it is testimonial. There\nhave been several criteria that this Court has looked\nat, including -- there are other kinds of analogies to\nthis that are akin to this kind of record. For\ninstance, in an assault case, a gun which is the real\nevidence -- remember the cocaine is the real evidence\nhere -- the Commonwealth would introduce a certificate\nsaying this is a working gun, and that is in lieu of the\nanalyst coming in. When we have to prove public way,\nwhen we have to prove school zone, when we have to prove\nin some instances --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ballistics as well? You\nwould extend this to ballistic tests?\nMS. COAKLEY: If --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't have to\nbring in the ballistic expert? You can just --\nMS. COAKLEY: Not to prove it's a working\nfirearm, Your Honor. In order to make a comparison -- I\nwould agree with counsel that once you get into the\ndiscretionary areas that you need to make comparisons\nand analysis, but this is not that case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that\ndifference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm looking at\nfootnote 10 in your brief on page 30. And you concede\nthat some interpretation of the machine-generated data\nordinarily is required. Now why isn't that a suggestion\nthat there is some leeway and subjective interpretation,\nand you might have different analysts coming out\ndifferently and so you need to get the fellow there and\nask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of\nyour fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion?\nOr this is subjective; I guess some people\nread it one way or the other one way; which way do you\nalways read it? That kind of stuff.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, interestingly, Your\nHonor, that argument wasn't raised in this case below\nand really hasn't been raised in this case before the\nCourt. In fact this is one of the straightforward\nobjective tests that says you put this material into the\nmachine, and the Solicitor General also deals with this.\nThe 100 percent accuracy by and large from that result\nsays this is cocaine; this is heroin, this is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I didn't -- I\ndidn't go back and read the scientific treatise you\ncite, but you say some interpretation is required. So\nwhat type of interpretation?\nMS. COAKLEY: The interpretation that\nbecause of the way that the machine works, the chemicals\nare separated out. And so a chemist, if properly\ntrained, can say by the separation of the chemicals\nthese three, or four or whatever the elements are, equal\ncocaine.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you have to have\na machine? I mean, what about -- what about ballistics?\n\"This bullet came from that gun.\" Does that involve\nsufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the\nexpert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug\ntesting doesn't?\nIt seems to me that's where you have to draw\nthe line.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, I believe that that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And to say that that\nwasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the\nquestion we are going to have to decide if you're going\nto prevail. I don't think it helps to say it wasn't\nraised in the case.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We are raising it.\nMS. COAKLEY: I agree, Your Honor. But that\nhas to do with how satisfied the Court is whether here\nor in other jurisdictions that is a reliable result, and\nI hesitate to use the word \"reliable.\" I don't mean it\nin the Ohio v. Roberts sense. We are talking about the\nscientific test that is or is not reliable, and\ntherefore does it require some other test, whether\nConfrontation Clause or not?\nJUSTICE BREYER: How can we administer\nsomething like that? His point I think is, look, you\ncan't make any distinction either of something that is\nevidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it\nwasn't. And if it was prepared with an eye towards\ntrial, well, then call the person and have him testify.\nThat's it. And if that encompasses every test under the\nsun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a\nreasonable line.\nYou start talking about reliability and\ntheir amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how\npolice labs or other labs have really been way off base\nand moreover really wrong. And you say, oh, distinguish\nbetween a police lab and University of Massachusetts?\nTry going down that road of which one is reliable, which\none isn't reliable. How do we know?\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's his point. No\nworkable way to do it. There can be horrors on both --\nin both areas, and so follow what the history was where\nthere was no history on this being admissible.\nMS. COAKLEY: Your Honor, I disagree because\nthe issues around many of those wrongful convictions\nrelated to suggestive identification procedures, other\nkinds of issues. I'm not aware of any wrongful\nconvictions that came about because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Aren't there some things I\nread in the paper all the time, about these laboratories\nin various places, and they lost the results, they got\nit all wrong? That just doesn't happen?\nMS. COAKLEY: I'm not saying that, Your\nHonor, but I'm saying there are certain evils that the\nConfrontation Clause is designed to prevent. Either\nabuse at the laboratory stage or misconduct by\nprosecutors prior to trial or analysts is not one that\nthe Confrontation Clause is either designed to or is\nspecifically very good at getting at.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? I know I prefer\none thing, the custody. It's very important to know\nwhether indeed this was the particular substance that\nwas taken from the defendant. And to establish that,\nyou have to establish a line of custody. And you can't\ndo that without getting in the person who did the test.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, Your Honor, I agree the\nchain of custody is crucial and it relates to the\ncareful procedure that a police officer used, who by the\nway is the confrontation witness that you worry about\nbecause the behavior is the buying, selling, possession\nof drugs. The element of whether it is cocaine or not\nreally becomes almost secondary to the case. The issue\nis was the behavior criminal? So the officer who seized\nthe drugs is available for confrontation. The drug is\nthen clearly marked so the Commonwealth has to create\nthat chain of custody for the court, and indeed if the\ndefendant, who is in the best position to think that\nperhaps this is involving something other than cocaine\nor heroin, has all the opportunities that he needs to\nmake sure that he gets a fair trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He says -- the policeman\nsays, \"And I gave it to the University of Massachusetts\nlab.\"\nMS. COAKLEY: And they marked it in a\nparticular way that identified --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"And I watched when they\nmarked it in a particular way.\"\nMS. COAKLEY: And the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do I know that that\nthing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who\nwrote this report?\nMS. COAKLEY: I think that whether you\nbrought the analyst in or not, you would have the same\nestablishment of the chain of custody and, indeed, that\npiece of evidence as to whether it's the same drug\nrelates to the officer in this case testified the\npackaging. He could identify it. It comes back --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say you can require\nwitnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did\nthe testing, you can require witnesses to testify? All\nthe way up to there but not the analyst himself?\nMS. COAKLEY: I think, Your Honor, that the\nissue between chain of custody and whether the\nConfrontation Clause is implicated are different issues\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you say that, it\nseems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently\n-- making a distinction between credibility issues and\nreliability issues. And I think you are implicitly\nsaying the Confrontation Clause is there to test\ncredibility but not reliability.\nMS. COAKLEY: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The machine is reliable;\ntherefore, it's outside of confrontation. And I don't\nunderstand the validity of this distinction that is\nimplicit in your answers.\nMS. COAKLEY: I think perhaps if the Court\nlooks at accuracy rather than reliability and gets\noutside the realm of the kinds of statements --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, accuracy --\nMS. COAKLEY: -- that we looked at.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- is an aspect of it.\nMS. COAKLEY: But accuracy goes to what this\nCourt has always allowed in referring to, for instance,\na business records exception or a public records\nexception. The reason they are admissible is precisely\nbecause we believe them to be accurate, and more\nimportantly in this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. They are\nadmissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation\nClause is concerned because they are not testimonial.\nMS. COAKLEY: And they are related, however,\nYour Honor, because the roots of whether it's hearsay or\nnot and the Confrontation Clause arguments come from the\nsame concern that somebody get a fair trial, that he or\nshe has the right to confront the witness --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are back to Roberts\nthen.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I do wish you would\ncomment on the argument that the State of California --\na huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems\nto get along all right under the rule that the\nPetitioner proposes.\nMS. COAKLEY: I did join the amicus brief,\nYour Honor. I believe and -- though I think it's too\nearly to tell because I, certainly from my own\nexperience, know that the number of cases that go to\ntrial is not an indication of what the work is that is\ninvolved, and I know that in Massachusetts it would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the State of California\nand other populous States have for, I take it, some\nnumber of years been able to function quite effectively\nunder the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to\nme that's something that you have to address.\nMS. COAKLEY: And I address that, Your\nHonor, by saying that for Massachusetts it would be an\nundue burden with very little benefit to the defendant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would it be undue for\nCalifornia and not for -- are you accepting the fact\nthat in California it's a workable rule and it's caused\nno problems?\nMS. COAKLEY: I -- I can't disagree with\nthat, Your Honor. I don't have enough information about\nthe way California works or doesn't work. I know that\nas a practical matter --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it seems to me it's\na very important point.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, as a practical matter in\nMassachusetts, it would mean that district court\nmisdemeanor drug prosecutions would essentially grind to\na halt, and the value to the defendant -- and this Court\nhas looked at in Inadi and in other situations where\nthere does not seem to be the real issue involved with\nConfrontation Clause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're predicting\nthat grind to a halt, but there are going to be a large\nnumber that wash out because they are plea bargained.\nSo they won't get into the picture at all. There will\nprobably be a goodly number in which defense counsel\nwill stipulate that the drug quantity -- the drug type\nwas such and such and quantity such and such. So you\ndon't know in how many cases the defendant would take\nadvantage of this confrontation right?\nMS. COAKLEY: No, and they often will not\nstipulate, Your Honor, until the day of trial when they\nrealize that the chemist is there. That's from my own\nexperience and that's a commonsensical rule. The\nquestion is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't these people have to\nappear before the same judge again and again? The point\nmade these are repeat attorneys, and I don't think you\nmake friends and influence people among judges by\ninsisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is\nobviously not needed.\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, two points, Your Honor:\nIn Massachusetts, we do have a circuit court and a\nsuperior court so judges move around. And the second\nthing is that -- my experience is that defendants,\nwhether appointed or otherwise, are extremely vigorous\nin protecting their rights, and if I were defense\ncounsel and I had a strategic advantage, I would insist\non it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you see any reason --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think California\ndid not join the amicus brief.\nMS. COAKLEY: Then I misspoke.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you see any reason why a\nnotice-and-demand statute wouldn't satisfy your concern?\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, the -- the Petitioner\nagreed that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: A bland notice-and-demand\nstatute --\nMS. COAKLEY: We would argue that\nMassachusetts' statute is the functional equivalent of a\nnotice-and-demand statute and complies with whatever\nconcerns the Court may have about the right to\nconfrontation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's the\ncentral issue in the case? The defense says, \"That\nstuff I was carrying was not cocaine. Either I was\ntrying -- you know, I was going to stiff the person I\nwas selling it to or whatever.\" That's the sole\ndefense. That's not cocaine. All you've got to do is\nsubmit an affidavit from the lab guy saying, \"I tested\nit; it is\"?\nMS. COAKLEY: Well, from the prosecution's\npoint of view that would be a bad strategic decision.\nThat's an instance where you would bring in the analyst\nbecause you want to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a non- answer. We\nare asking what's the rule?\nMS. COAKLEY: The rule --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you submit it on the\naffidavit, as the Chief Justice said under your theory\nof the case?\nMS. COAKLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You'd try to have some\ndifferent hypothesis?\nMS. COAKLEY: Yes, because the defendant has\nplenty of opportunity to both have an independent exam,\nto subpoena the witness in himself, to make sure that if\nthat is a true issue at trial -- in many instances --\nmost instances it's not, but he will have the\nopportunity to cross-examine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMs. Schertler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Confrontation Clause is not implicated\nwhen a human being merely authenticates for trial the\ninstruments-generated result of a scientific test. That\nis because the direct output of an instrument is not\ntestimonial and human assertions that merely establish\nthe foundation for admitting nontestimonial evidence do\nnot themselves trigger Confrontation Clause rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe if you were\njust -- if you were just putting in the machine, the raw\ninformation from the machine. But here what speaks is\nthe certification by the analyst, so you don't have\nsimply a machine-generated result; you have a human\nperson who seems to be testifying: I certify that this\nis an accurate report.\nMS. SCHERTLER: If I could draw an analogy,\nJustice Ginsburg, to a historical example that we think\nillustrates our point, historically records custodians\n-- public records custodians have been permitted to\ncertify through, when they have express authority at the\ncommon law, and -- and into present day that they did a\nrecords search, that they found a document within the\npublic records of an agency, and that the document that\nthey are attaching is a true copy of what they found.\nThose are statements by humans that really\nset forth the conditions for -- under which the evidence\nis being presented to the jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMS. SCHERTLER: But those have always been\naccepted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not material prepared\nfor trial. It's not material that was generated\nprecisely in order to prosecute an individual.\nMS. SCHERTLER: The underlying material in\nthe public records case is not testimonial because it\nwas not prepared for trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMS. SCHERTLER: In this case, Justice\nScalia, we would submit that the underlying material is\nalso not testimonial, albeit for a separate reason; and\nthat is that it is an instrument-generated result and\ntherefore not the statement of a witness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's, let's assume that\nit's critical to a particular murder prosecution what\ntime the shot was fired, okay? And you mean to tell me\nif -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at\nthe time the shot was fired, that would not be\ntestimony? Yes, the clock is a machine, right?\nMS. SCHERTLER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is just reciting what\nthe clock said.\nMS. SCHERTLER: My analogy would be, Justice\nScalia, if that clock had in itself a trigger mechanism\nthat would detect when a gunshot was fired; and if that\nclock delivered, as you have in the cases of a drug\nanalysis, a result, a reading that one could submit into\ncourt that says shot detected at 12 p.m., that that\nnontestimonial evidence could be submitted consistently\nwith Confrontation Clause principles, but it would still\nrequire authentication.\nSome person may have to establish that this\nclock was set up, it was operating properly, it was\ncalibrated the way it had to. Those all go to the same\nsorts of foundational facts that are akin to the public\nrecords certificate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you make me think the\npublic certificate. Let's imagine birth and death\nrecords. There is a whole building full of them; they\nare on microfiche. Now, I am not sure how Massachusetts\nworks, but I suppose if you want to introduce one you\ncall up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up,\nproduces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe\nwritten beneath it which says: \"This is a true copy of\nthe,\" and you don't call in the keeper.\nNow that statement on a piece of paper,\n\"this is a true copy of the birth certificate of John\nSmith,\" that was prepared specifically for this trial.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I take it that has\nnothing -- I mean we'll find out, but if they win, every\none of those cases, every document you have to bring in\nthe person to make clear that the document that says\nthat this is a copy of the document --\nMS. SCHERTLER: Our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that what -- is that the\npoint?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, that is -- that is our\npoint. That it is too -- it is too simplified to say,\nas Petitioner does here, that if it's an affidavit or a\ncertificate, and it's prepared for trial, that's the end\nof the analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have to have some\nboundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to\nhave some explanation. You started talking about a\nmachine. There is no machine in Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical, so it seems to me you have two different\nrationales floating around here and -- and neither are\ntethered to a specific rule.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, Justice Kennedy, this\nis why I would bring those two rules together. In the\npublic records example, what you have is underlying\nevidence going into the jury that is nontestimonial. In\nthat instance, it was because it was a public record not\nprepared for trial but has always been accepted from --\nhas always been viewed as nontestimonial.\nYour Honor is correct. In this case we\ndon't have that, but what we do have is an underlying\nevidentiary item that is nontestimonial for a separate\npurpose, and that is that it is a machine-generated\nresult.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're going to work\neither. Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's\naccusers wanted to testify about something that was\nnontestimonial: what happened on the day. So what we\nare looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a\nvery peculiar result that's going to have every public\ndocument in the United States suddenly have the keeper\nof that document having to come into court.\nOn the other hand, I'm having a hard time\nfiguring out what the distinction is between that and\nall these other things.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well -- yes, Justice Breyer.\nLet me just add that in the public records custodian\nsituation, there is always the possibility that the\npublic records custodian who is signing that certificate\nwas careless, is a liar; and those certificates yet have\nalways been viewed as simply foundational vehicles for\ngetting to the jury nontestimonial evidence. The\ndefense is not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Schertler, please\nclarify one thing for me. Is the rule you're seeking\none limited to tests performed by machines?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The rule that I have\narticulated so far, yes. It is -- it would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So would you agree the\nConfrontation Clause would apply if it were an\nindependent expert's test -- test results and testimony.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Justice Stevens, we also\nhave an alternative argument --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just tell me yes or no.\nMS. SCHERTLER: No. I would not. Because\nwe have an alternative --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then we shouldn't\ntalk about just machines.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, we hope to rely on one\nof the same arguments that Massachusetts does, which is\nthat there was a broad exception at common law for\nofficial records, those created by public officers doing\ntheir duty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me you have to\ndo that because there is all sorts of machines that have\nto be interpreted. There -- a chromatic spectrum\nanalysis; the person has to say what he saw there, what\nshe saw there.\nMS. SCHERTLER: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So just because the\nmachine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a\nsensible rule based on that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there was not a broad\nexception at common law for public records created in\nanticipation of criminal litigation.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, we have -- I mean, we\nhave looked for that limitation in the authorities and\nwe simply have not found it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have you found cases where\nthe material was admitted as a public record despite the\nfact that it was a public record created for\nprosecution?\nMR. FISHER: The difficulty with that,\nJustice Scalia, is I don't know of equivalent or\ncomparable records that were being created at that time\nfor purposes of litigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: These other records, no,\nyou haven't found them.\nMS. SCHERTLER: No. I have -- I have not.\nYet, if I could go back to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion, there is no record here about how this test in\nparticular was done, but there -- there -- I can tell\nthe Court that actually technology in the controlled\nsubstance area is to the point where an instrument does\nin fact provide an answer to the analyst. It provides a\nmass spectrum of the unknown and a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes but the rule, the\nissue is not limited to drug cases. Murder cases, all\nsorts of cases where there is scientific evidence.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, the -- the narrower\nrule that we are discussing here would be limited to\nthose situations in which the underlying evidence to be\npresented to the jury is nontestimonial because it is\ninstrument-generated and did not require human analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is your -- what\nis your answer to the question I posed to the Attorney\nGeneral? The only issue in the case is whether the\npowder is or is not cocaine. You think you get by if\nthe law says you can admit this with an affidavit?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice for\nthe following reason. Just as in the case of the\nrecords custodians, a defendant may believe that that is\nnot an authentic record; and nothing about the rule we\npropose would prevent the defense from challenging the\nauthenticity or the circumstances, the correctness of\nthe testing procedures that were used.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can't --\nMS. SCHERTLER: It's just a question of\nwhether -- whether the Confrontation Clause requires\nthat that challenge occur in the Government's case on\ncross-examination, or as in these record custodian's\ncases, if the defense wants to challenge the\nauthenticity of the underlying nontestimonial evidence,\nhe must do so in his case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you comment on the\nCalifornia experience, please?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I would -- I would be happy\nto, Justice Kennedy.\nI -- I don't have information about\nCalifornia. I do have information about the District of\nColumbia. And I can tell the court that in the time\nperiod since the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\nheld that these sorts of certificates of analysis were\ntestimonial, that the court appearances that have been\nrequired of DEA chemists at the Mid-Atlantic laboratory\nhave increased by 500 percent, from seven to 10\nappearances per month to routinely over 50 per month,\nand that the corresponding time that it takes to analyze\nsubstance has increased.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\nFive minutes, Mr. Fisher.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Let me start, Your Honors: If\nthere is any doubt remaining about the machine-generated\ntheory that the Solicitor General was putting forward\ntoday, again I would refer the court back to the\nscientific evidence treatise.\nThe raw data of a mass spectrometer looks --\nlooks something like a heart monitor. It's a printout\nof the squiggly line across the page that a person needs\nto look at and then analyze as to what it shows about\nthe molecular composite of the substance that the\nmachine was operating. We have no objection if\nprosecutors in criminal cases want to introduce machine\ngenerated data. They can do that.\nBut what they can't do is introduce --\nintroduce affidavits certifying as to their -- you know,\ntheir interpretation of what a machine did or simply\nwhat a machine says, because there is no difference --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say they could\nintroduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an\nanalyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that\nthis was cocaine?\nMR. FISHER: They could do that, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your distinction\nwith the recordkeeper?\nMR. FISHER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your distinction\nfrom your own theory of the recordkeeper? Does the\nrecordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify\nto testify that this is indeed the record?\nMR. FISHER: My understanding of the common\nlaw on that, as the solicitor general put it, is that\nthat was a foundational requirement that was not\nnecessarily considered evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, there's a\nhearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect. I'm not saying\nit's the only thing. There is a chain and so forth but,\nthere is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay.\nThe certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth\ncertificate. That's what the -- now, that's that person\noutside of court who made that little piece of paper for\npurposes of this case. And moreover, the statement that\nit certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole\nthing falls without it.\nSo, are you going to say the same thing\napplies, your rule, and you have to call the\nrecordkeeper in or not? And I think you're going to say\nnot. And if you're going to say not, I want to know\nwhat the distinction is?\nMR. FISHER: As a general matter, yes, our\nrule is consistent. Now, if you look at Wigmore,\nWigmore --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are going to calling\nin -- you're going to --\nMR. FISHER: I'm trying to answer. What\nWigmore says is that something like a public\nrecordkeeper's seal was not considered evidence, per se.\nIt was a foundational requirement to put evidence in.\nAnd so, in this Court's words in the Dowdell case, it's\nsomething like a court reporter's transcript that goes\nup to a Court of Appeals and then is looked at. It's\nnot considered evidence against a criminal defendant.\nNow, in stark contrast to this case where\nthe document is expressly citing to a statute of\nMassachusetts law and saying this element of the\ncriminal charge is satisfied. It is a very big\ndifference.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The graph, spectrograph\nor -- or -- or the -- the chart is introduced. Chain of\ncustody is either stipulated or established. Can a\nperson who did not make the test testify as to what that\nline -- what that graph means, and would that be\nsufficient to convict?\nMR. FISHER: So long as chain of custody was\nsatisfied, yes, Justice Kennedy, that someone could take\nthe stand and do that. But remember, the reports in\nthis case do not just report -- even if you accepted the\nsolicitor's general's version that they are reporting\nwhat the machine said about the substance, they also\nhave a paragraph before that, and this goes to Justice\nScalia's question, say, these are -- these are the\nsubstances that were taken from the defendant in this\ncase and given to me by this officer, and so, that is\nadditional information that is being sworn to in the\naffidavit in this case that is also testimony.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't you insist, even\nin that case, on the confrontation right to examine the\nperson who actually conducted the test itself and\ngenerated the papers that the later expert testifies on\nin order to determine the admissibility of the -- of\nthe -- the test results themselves?\nMR. FISHER: I think the defendant may have\nthat right. I understood Justice Kennedy's hypothetical\nto suggest that that chain of custody was stipulated to\nor otherwise agreed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. All I wanted to know\nwas whether you were giving that away or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but chain of custody\nis -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis\nand the professional opinion. My question is only chain\nof custody has been established, that's gone to the\nlaboratory, the paper is produced, an outside witness\ntestifies to what the paper means. I thought you said\nthat that suffices.\nMR. FISHER: I did. So I think I'm --\nhere's what I'm saying.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this. There\nare -- there are -- there are three possibility\nsubjects: Chain of custody, conduct of test,\nsignificance or meaning of the squiggles. As I\nunderstand it, you have said if the chain of custody is\nestablished and if the squiggles are admitted in\nevidence, an expert who did not do the test can testify\nabout the significance of the squiggles. But that\nleaves the question of the -- the evidence about the\nconduct of the test itself.\nAnd I understood you to say to me that you\nwere not conceding that you did not have a -- a\nconfrontation right to examine the person who did the\ntest itself in order to determine admissibility.\nMR. FISHER: I think what we are doing here\nis disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody\nbegins and ends. To the extent chain of custody gets\nyou to the point at which the substance is put into the\nmachine, and that was stipulated to or otherwise not\nthought about, then, yes, the printout could be\nintroduced into evidence and anyone could testify as to\nwhat that printout means. But to the extent that there\nwas a gap between the drugs getting into the laboratory\nand being put into the machine by somebody that the\ndefendant was not stipulating to, then whoever did\nthat -- if the State were going to assert this is who\ndid it and this is the drugs that we had -- that would\nbe something that would be subject to cross-examination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
