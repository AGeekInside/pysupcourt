        "content": "(10:50 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in Jackson\nagainst the Birmingham Board of Education.\nMr. Dellinger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder the decision below, title IX stands alone\nas the only major civil rights statute that would permit\nretaliation against those who complain that the law is\nbeing violated. There are at least a half a dozen anti-\ndiscrimination laws that do not contain a separate\nretaliation provision, and every one of them has been\nfound to prohibit retaliation as one kind of\ndiscrimination.\nThere's a reason for that. Anti-discrimination\nlaws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation\nare allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their\ninstitutions into compliance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, the question is\nwhether -- that -- that may be true, but there would be an\nadministrative remedy. The question here is a private\ncause of action for damages.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is true, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- even assuming the --\nthe validity of your premise, you still have another step.\nMR. DELLINGER: I understand that other step,\nand I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the\nCity of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a\nright of action to enforce title IX, even though there was\nalso administrative remedies available and which was\nvalidated by Congress, as this Court -- every member of\nthis Court recognized in -- in Sandoval.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought\nthat Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on\nthe books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of\ncreation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon\nexemplifies.\nMR. DELLINGER: In this case, there is no doubt\nthat the two established principles together that are\nsettled support this cause of action. The first is that\nthere is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's\nCannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through -- your\nopinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law\nand, the second point, that the statute itself is\nviolated.\nTitle IX is violated by retaliatory action\nagainst Coach Jackson. He's -- and -- and this is an\nimportant part of title IX because, particularly here,\npeople like Coach Jackson need to come forward because\nstudents are often minors. They're not in the best\nposition to know the budgets. It is people like Coach\nJackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is\nrecognized about the -- about the cause of action for\nretaliation is that it is very important to enable people\nto bring their institutions into compliance without\nresorting to litigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's very -- it's very useful,\nI'm sure, but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I am\nsure. If I were -- if I were a coach, one of the first\nthings -- especially a coach of a women's team in high\nschool, one of the first things I would do would be to\ncomplain about not -- not getting enough facilities. This\nwould make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether --\nwhether I'm a lousy coach or not. You -- you would have\nto think twice before you fire me because I would have a\nretaliation claim.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, the burden, of\ncourse, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation.\nAnd you should take great comfort from the fact,\nthe Court can take great comfort from the fact that\nretaliation has been established as a violation of all of\nthe major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to\ntitle VI --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them specifically\nprovide for retaliation, don't they?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do they do that if, as you\nassert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, Congress has taken a\ndifferent approach. In some cases, there would be a\ntextual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of\ndiscrimination based on such individual's race or national\norigin. Title -- and -- and therefore, it might need a\nspecific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon --\nabout discrimination on the basis of sex.\nAnd here I think to -- to allay your concern\nabout the coach, we have had -- title IX's retaliation\nprovision has been the established law. It was the law at\nthe time Congress -- it was understood, at the time\nCongress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of\ntitle VI had been construed by the administrative agency\nto include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress\nenacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan\ndecision, which had recognized that discrimination can\ninclude retaliation.\nSo that it comes as no surprise that every court\nof appeals that has addressed this issue has found that\nthere's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years,\nthere -- at most we can find 140 reported cases in the\nFederal system where there is a claim for retaliation\nunder title IX, and under title IX and all of the other\ndiscrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly\nsatisfactory to work out the causation requirements and --\nin -- in dealing with retaliation cases.\nNow, here, what the respondent did is they\ndischarged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for\ngirls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse\ntreatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so,\nbecause he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was\ndiscriminating on the basis of sex.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that it -- it is a\nreasonable description of what happened -- he was fired\nfor complaining about his girls' team not getting enough\nfacilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded\nfrom participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to\ndiscrimination under an education program?\nMR. DELLINGER: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that -- that\nremotely describes what happened to this coach?\nMR. DELLINGER: Absolutely. First of all, the\n-- the court of appeals correctly says -- in the petition\nappendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for\nthe purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated\nagainst Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX\nviolations. But for the discrimination on the basis of\nsex, he would not have complained, and he not -- had he\nnot made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't\nhave lost his position. He is denied the benefit of\ncoaching in the program. He's denied the ability to\nparticipate in this federally funded program as a coach,\nand he is discriminated against by being singled out for\nretaliation.\nAnd this is not a case in which -- that has\nconcern -- I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question\nabout this being a funding case, and I understand the\nspecial sensitivity that the Court has about rules that\nare based upon spending requirements where you want to be\nsure that States understand what they're agreeing to when\nthey accept the Federal funds.\nThis is not a case in which it could not have\nbeen anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that\ntime, at the time these funds were accepted, which would\nhave been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex\ndiscrimination was itself, of course, universally known.\nRetaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that.\nWe had had 30 years where both the Department of Education\nand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but that's again the\nquestion of the substantive scope of the provision, and\nthat's different from whether there was a congressional\nintent to create a private cause of action for this sort\nof violation. And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and so\nforth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause\nof actions anymore. You have to show that there's a\ncongressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a\nprivate cause of action for damages.\nMR. DELLINGER: I think the Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- that's quite\nseparate from --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. I -- I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- from this -- from the\nquestion of substantive liability.\nMR. DELLINGER: I understand that. Here, first\nof all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when\nit passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was\na background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting\nPark that -- that retaliation was considered a part of\ndiscrimination. The title VI regulations were themselves\nwell known based on identical language, virtually verbatim\nlanguage. It provided for retaliation.\nAnd moreover, this Court as recently as the\nDavis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven\ncase has found that employment discrimination, sexual\nharassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment\nall come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that\nCannon v. the City of -- v. the University of Chicago\ncreates that cause of action.\nNow, this case is actually a lot easier than\nDavis, even taking into account the concerns that -- that\nyou and other Justices expressed there, because this is\nnot a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for\nthe acts of third parties like students over whom you may\nhave limited control. This is deliberately undertaken\nactions by the responsible officials acting intentionally.\nIt's not a novel concept the way one could argue that\npeer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of\ndiscrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 30\nyears by the responsible Federal agency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's separate enough\nfrom discrimination that in other statutes, although\nCongress does create a cause of action for discrimination,\nit goes out of its way to create a separate cause of\naction for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and\nif it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me\nthat you could clearly say that -- that when the State\nsigned on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they\nshould have known that this door to litigation was being\nopened to them. Yes, litigation for -- for discrimination\nagainst -- against female athletes, but not -- not\ndiscrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a\nwhole, new area.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, with -- with all\ndue respect, I don't think there's any way, when the\ndistrict accepted these funds, that they could have\nreasonably relied on the assumption that they would be\nfree to retaliate against people who tried to comply --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but there was -- there\nwas -- let's go back to this for just a moment -- an\nadministrative remedy available for retaliation expressly\nunder the regs?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And did this petitioner seek\nan administrative remedy at all?\nMR. DELLINGER: He did not seek an\nadministrative remedy. He went through the school system\nitself at every level. He went through five different\nlevels, following the chain of command.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What would the administrative\nremedy have allowed here --\nMR. DELLINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- had it been sought?\nMR. DELLINGER: Here, as in Franklin, as in\nDavis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in\nevery one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in\nall of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with\nrace, you can call this to attention to the office of\ncivil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an\ninquiry. Ultimately they have the authority of the\ndraconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they have any other\nsanction? Because the notion of an administrative remedy\nordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's\ncomplaining. But as I understand it, this administrative\nprocess, this detailed administrative process, leads only\nto one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So that's it. It would not\nhave permitted a restoration of the job to the --\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- petitioner.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is not part of the -- the\nadministrative process is only about institutional\nfunding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld\nthe right to bring these actions for what are violations\nof the statute itself.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if we don't accept --\nlet's assume, just for the sake of argument, that -- that\nwe're having trouble accepting the -- the analysis that it\nis a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms.\nYou then made the argument that, in fact, you should\nrecognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of\n-- of school students and so on, if you don't allow\nretaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the\nwhistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute\nis going to be a dead letter.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the -- the argument is\nyou -- you should recognize this as a necessity.\nThat, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice\nO'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a\nprivate cause of action as opposed to the government\nallowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were\nleading up to saying the administrative remedy simply\nisn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact,\nthey don't impose it, or for some other reason.\nSo my question is, is there an argument to say\nthat the administrative remedy simply is not good enough\nto preclude -- to -- to deter retaliation and that's why\nyou've got to have a private cause of action?\nMR. DELLINGER: That -- that is absolutely\nright.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's -- what are the facts?\nWhat's the empirical evidence for that?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you know if administrative\nsanctions have been imposed under title IX against\nschools?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, I'm sure there have been\nsome instances in which there have been administrative\nsanctions under title IX. And I don't -- I do not have\nfigures on those, Justice O'Connor.\nBut let me --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have funds --\nMR. DELLINGER: -- let me suggest --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- have funds -- Mr.\nDellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school\nbecause of a violation of --\nMR. DELLINGER: Not to my knowledge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- title IX?\nMR. DELLINGER: But I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That could be because --\nMR. DELLINGER: -- I actually have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the sanction is so draconian\nthat nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the\ncoach. Of course, they're going to rehire. I -- I find\nit hard to believe why a draconian sanction is\nineffective.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, if it's never -- I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it's -- it's\noverwhelmingly effective. You tell the school you either\nrehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it hard to decide what\nthey're going to do?\nMR. DELLINGER: I do have an answer, first, for\nJustice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger. The\nsanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting\noff funds. And it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I can't imagine anyone\nwho would want such a sanction. Which doesn't help --\nMR. DELLINGER: That is certainly not what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the girls on the team.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- Coach -- Coach Jackson would\nhave sought, and -- and because that process is not one\nthat's responsive to the individual case -- if you're down\nin Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office\nthat has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a\nsanction, the fact of the matter is -- and it's the\nreason --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying the coach\ncares more about it than the Government does?\nMR. DELLINGER: That may well be the case,\nabsolutely. And Coach Jackson --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if the Government\nis charged with -- with just spending the funds and\ndoesn't think that this is worth its time, why should\nthere be a private cause of action --\nMR. DELLINGER: Because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when -- when a private\ncause of action is harder for us to imply than it -- than\nit is to an administrative remedy?\nMR. DELLINGER: Because in this case people like\nCoach Jackson -- it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to\ncome forward. If he's not able to -- if he's not\nprotected and able to come forward, if retaliation is\npossible, then you can't expect the -- the teenagers\nthemselves to carry this burden.\nAnd in fact, it's the reason this Court\nrecognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in\nDavis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to\nprotect the whistle blower and they're not going to be\nable to come forward.\nAnd it's not just whistle blowers, Justice\nKennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions\ncomply and when those efforts at compliance result in\npenalties against them. It has not led to an excessive\namount of litigation, but it has been very effective in\ngiving people comfort to know that they can't be\nretaliated against.\nAnd -- and I -- I understand the -- going to the\nnecessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the\nstatute because it is a form of discrimination on the\nbasis of sex. It is part and parcel. The history of\ndiscrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing\npeople from their jobs is what you did when they\ncomplained about discrimination, when they tried to vote,\nwhen they tried to enroll their students in schools, and\nit is part and parcel of that discrimination. And it is\ndiscrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on\nbehalf of sex.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --\nMR. DELLINGER: I'll reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Gornstein, do you have\nany light to shed on the extent to which administrative\nsanctions have ever been imposed against schools and --\nand the feasibility of going that route?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Administrative sanction has\nnever been imposed under title IX.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They have been under title VI?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There has been one case in which\nan administrative sanction was imposed under title VI,\nJustice Kennedy.\nIt -- the agency does have some flexibility to\nattempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the\nsanction, the final sanction, but --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you take the position that\nwhat occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the\nstatute as discrimination?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: We do, Justice -- Justice\nO'Connor. I'm sorry. Retaliation against a person\nbecause that person has complained about sex\ndiscrimination under title IX is itself discrimination\nwithin the meaning of title IX. And that conclusion flows\nfrom four considerations, beginning with the Court's\ndecision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the\nCourt held that a person subjected to retaliation because\nhe complained about racial discrimination against his\nlessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which\nonly prohibits racial discrimination. Against the\nbackdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have\nunderstood its prohibition against sex discrimination to\nafford comparable protection against retaliation. So a\nperson who is subjected --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why would Congress then in\nsome statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others\nnot? I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It is, Justice O'Connor, but the\nexplanation for that for -- in title VII, for example, is\nthat the core prohibitions in title VII refer to\ndiscrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or\nnational origin, and that such individual's language rules\nout the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It rules out this one, but\nit doesn't rule out the main -- look it, this is a weird\nkind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim\nis the person who has been discriminated against complains\nabout the discrimination, and for that complaint, the\nperson who was discriminated against is demoted or not\npromoted, or whatever. That's -- that's the classic\nretaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely\ncovered by -- on the basis of that person's sex. If --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If it's based on the fact\nthat the -- that the person is complaining about sex\ndiscrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's\nexactly the same theory of discrimination that we have\nhere, Justice Scalia. And that theory of discrimination\nwas recognized in the Sullivan decision. Discrimination\noccurs when there is retaliation against a person because\nhe's complaining about racial discrimination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the date of the\nSullivan case?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It was 3 years before Congress\nenacted section -- I think it was '68 -- '69. I'm sorry.\n'69.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: '69.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It was '69, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you think that we\ntake the same approach to implied causes of action today\nthat we took in 1969?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: You do not, Justice Scalia, when\nyou are starting afresh, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we certainly did not with\na Spending Clause case.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's true, Justice Kennedy.\nBut to answer Justice Scalia's question, first,\nyou operate in the legal context in which Congress was\noperating at the time, and Congress would have understood\n-- and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan\ndecision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that\nthere was a private right of action and once in deciding\nthat the private right of action included a claim for\ndamages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what case it is,\nbut one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that\nthe statute before us had been enacted by Congress before\nwe had set our face against implied causes of action, and\ntherefore, we should interpret that statute the way we\nused to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said\nthat our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of\naction, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were\nenacted by a Congress that -- that thought we would go\nskipping along forever as we did in 1969 or -- or not.\nAnd -- and that's what you're asking us to do here.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just because Congress in -- in\nthe -- at the time this statute was enacted believed in\nthe existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find\nimplied causes of action, we -- we have to do that for all\nthese old statutes.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Let -- let me talk about the\ncases that I think the principle that you're talking about\nemerges from. One is the Central Bank case, and what you\nwere asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and\nabetters, to the statute. We're not asking you to add\nwords to this statute. We're asking you to interpret the\nwords that are there --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about Virginia --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- in light of the relevant\ncontext.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about Virginia\nBankshares?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm -- I'm not sure about\nVirginia Bankshares, but I don't think it -- it states a\nprinciple.\nThe other case that I was thinking about,\nJustice Kennedy, is the -- is the Sandoval case. And\nagain, there somebody was asking you to afford a private\nright of action for something that the statute did not\nitself prohibit. And what we are saying here is,\ninterpret this statute in light of the legal context that\nCongress had it, which is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it -- it's arguable\nexcept that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against\nbecause of his gender.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. But this\nstatute does not require discrimination because of such\nindividual's sex. It require --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- exactly like title VII,\nbut --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It's -- it's written exactly not\nlike title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far\nmore like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan,\nwhich doesn't have a such individual's limitation. And in\n-- and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination\non the basis of race in depriving people of interests of\nproperty violates that statute and affords a private right\nof action to the victim of retaliation.\nAnd so too here. And a person who is victimized\nby retaliation because that person has been subjected\nbefore -- because he complained about sex discrimination\nis a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's where you hang. You\n-- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX,\npaid close attention and said -- instead of saying no\nperson in the United States shall on the basis of that\nperson's sex be excluded from participation, you think\nsomebody had -- had suggested that language, and they\nsaid, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We\nhave to take out that person's. I -- I don't -- it\ndoesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not\nincluding the word that person's sex. It's a very natural\nway to write it: no person in the United States shall on\nthe basis of sex.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But this is -- it opens it up to\nthis interpretation, and then you have to look at all the\nrelevant considerations. Inserting the words, such\nindividual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation\nclaim, and it's not here. And so it's -- then you have to\nlook at all the other relevant considerations, including\nSullivan, including the fact that this is of vital\nimportance to promoting the purposes of the act, including\nthe fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this\nprovision have both interpreted -- the key agencies have\ninterpreted it to encompass protection against\nretaliation, and including the fact that there's\nabsolutely no legitimate interest that a -- a recipient\nhas in retaliating against somebody simply because he's\nfiled a title IX sex discrimination complaint.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gornstein, what\nimplication would there be, if we took the view of the\ncircuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have\na discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with\nrespect to Federal employees, if I understand.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. In -- it -- we\n-- we have taken the position that there is, based on a\ntextual argument within the Federal sector provision, a\nbasis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above\nthe use of discrimination. We have not taken that\nposition with respect to the -- to some other statutes.\nSo we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and\nthat you just can't adopt an automatic principle that\nbecause there's an anti-discrimination provision, it\nautomatically always picks up retaliation protection. You\nhave to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis.\nAnd here, though, all the relevant\nconsiderations, including Sullivan, including the need for\nthis kind of protection to further the purposes of the\nstatute, including the agencies' interpretation of this\nstatute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that\nthis was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to\nget back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending\nClause.\nWhat the Spending Clause does not require is\nthat it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it\nrequired that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer\nharassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice,\nand that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision,\nthis Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important\nbackdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and\nfinally the regulations themselves, which specifically\nforbid retaliation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are punitive damages available\nunder title IX?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm sorry. Punitive damages\nwould not be available against a municipality or against a\n-- but it could be available against some other private\nrecipients.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Thomas.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. THOMAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Stevens, may it please the\nCourt:\nJustice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the\nquestion that you raised immediately. I can't think of\nany school board lawyer who is called by his\nsuperintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and\nthey want to know why you aren't doing this and that who\nwould not be in that superintendent's office that moment\nbecause when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I\nmean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative\nteams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They\ncome in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I\ncan't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is.\nAnd so I say I wanted you to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How often has OCR come to the\nschool district in question under title IX? There are\nmany statutes that --\nMR. THOMAS: And I would want to suggest --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- OCR administers.\nMR. THOMAS: In 1996, we had a conclusion of an\nOCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys'\nfootball as it related to related sports offered for\ngirls. So we -- we know about OCR, and they're in\nAtlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when -- and\nwhen they come, they come, Your Honors.\nIf I may, I'd like to get right now to what I\nhad raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an\nimplied private right of action under title IX for\nretaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not\na victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's\nan advocate of gender equity, and we say no.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does he differ -- how\ndoes he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was\ncomplaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to\nAfrican Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and\nas a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this\nCourt said he could maintain that suit.\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one\nobservation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary\nadministrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the\nonly advocate available at that time was the owner of the\nhome. And -- but I would comment that as he continued in\nhis litigation, he continued to advocate.\nUnder title IX, as we have discussed, for the\nadvocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and\nexpress your concerns and your issues about what's\nhappening. And we find significance in that because the\nultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would\nbe the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr.\nJackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's\nsuccessful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to\nhim. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or\nyou're enjoined from retaliating against him in the\nfuture, but nothing from that Federal court would go to\nbenefit the girls' basketball team.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what do you make\nof the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others\nhave stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative\nremedy in the real world? It's -- it's -- there -- there\nhave never -- there has never been an instance in which\nfunds have been withheld.\nMR. THOMAS: Well, again, Justice Souter, no,\nthe funds have not been terminated. But I can only share\nwith you my experiences with dealing with these people.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you with respect to\nthat, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to\npick and choose because they simply don't have the\nresources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact,\ngo in and investigate? How many times do they say, well,\nthat's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls'\nbasketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Ginsburg, the only thing\nthat I can say is that on my watch, the number one\npriority is to keep OCR out. So -- so therefore --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't my question.\nMy question is of the universe of complaints that are made\nunder title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or\nisn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however\nmuch it may want to, come in the way you described?\nMR. THOMAS: Well, Your Honor, that was\nsomething that was recognized in Cannon. I -- I think\nthat was cited in several of the footnotes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was the very reason\nfor recognizing a private right of action because the --\nthe requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement,\nwould be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could\nenforce it.\nMR. THOMAS: But -- but again, stay mindful.\nGeraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get\nadmission to the -- the med school because of my sex, and\nshe is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on\nthe basis of sex. So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the argument\nthat's being raised is whether we're talking about the\nperson who is listed in the statute as the primary\nbeneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether\nwe're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and\nso on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this\nteacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private\naction, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if\n-- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've\neither got to recognize this kind of private action or you\ncan forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and --\nand so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the\nprimary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to\nthe point of the argument.\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Souter, let me offer this\nin two ways. One, it's not realistic. In -- in other\nwords, when -- when you have a scenario about the private\ncause of action, teachers aren't -- I mean, these parents\nand -- and the -- and especially in Birmingham, we have an\nathletic director at the school. We have a director of\nathletics for the whole school system. And so that --\nthat's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the\nday, the administration is very conscientious about all of\nits programs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's -- to say trust\nme is -- is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman\nin her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on\na team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly\nsituated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless\nyou have someone who is best positioned to know what is\ngoing on, who is the coach.\nMR. THOMAS: But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back\nto the point who really benefits because -- and especially\nin this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the\nmonetary damages, that goes to the advocate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the point is if you\nsay to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone\nbecause a complaint has been made, that's a powerful\nincentive for the school not to retaliate against someone\nand to do something about the discrimination.\nMR. THOMAS: Well, but again, though, Justice\nGinsburg, the other side of that would be when under the\nspending legislation, the school board had a right to know\nwhat the terms and conditions of the financial assistance\nwould be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was\nnowhere on the landscape that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wasn't it in the\nregulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly --\nthe -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to\nimplement this statute, here are our regulations and our\nregulations are you don't retaliate?\nMR. THOMAS: But that's a part of the complaint\nand investigatory process.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The regulations didn't say\nanything about a private cause of action, did it?\nMR. THOMAS: No, it did not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the statute didn't say\nanything about a private cause of action.\nMR. THOMAS: It's not on the face.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the regulation did tell\nthe school not to retaliate in effect.\nTell me, does the record disclose what happened\nto the petitioner, Jackson? What -- what has been the\nresult of all this? Does the record tell us that?\nMR. THOMAS: No, it does not, Justice O'Connor.\nAnd -- and again, it's on a motion to dismiss,\nand obviously, once it was --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it tell us that he was\nremoved as coach?\nMR. THOMAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does the record tell us that?\nMR. THOMAS: It -- it does say that he was\nrelieved.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a legal question,\nnothing to do with, you know, practicalities?\nMR. THOMAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you go back to the\nvery old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's.\nThey pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of\nlegislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that\ncivil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been\nkept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically\nbadly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was\nassociating with people who were black. And they both go\ninto the restaurant and they both are refused service.\nMaybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them.\nNow, can the white individual bring a lawsuit\nunder the -- the civil rights statute? I've always\nthought the answer to that question is, of course, he can.\nWould you -- do you think it's the contrary answer?\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Breyer, in that context --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. THOMAS: -- I -- I would say yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course.\nMR. THOMAS: But again --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So therefore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a civil rights statute\nthat provides for a private cause of action? I -- I want\nto know what the hypothetical is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd -- I'd like to -- I'm\nthinking of various civil rights statutes which make it\nunlawful to describe -- to -- to discriminate. And now, I\nagree with you on that answer. The white person could\nbring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race\nbecause he's being discriminated against not because of\nhis own race, but because he's being -- he's associated\nwith people who are being discriminated against. I agree\nwith your answer.\nAnd so my question is if that's so and if we\nhave a long history here of the words, on the basis of\nsex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but\nretaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's\nwhat I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing\nAnd to get out my whole question -- there are\ntwo parts -- why isn't this the same thing? And the\nsecond part is, because I think it is the same thing --\nthe second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is\nit 1681(a)?\nMR. THOMAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Once we include this in\n1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then\nsupports the other side. It doesn't support you. All\nright. That's my question.\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Breyer, don't we have to\nconsider at some point in time what the congressional\nintent was?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes.\nMR. THOMAS: And again -- and I submit to you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you -- you go ahead. I'm\ndoing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old\ncivil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the\nbasis of your own race. History makes clear that\nretaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit\nwithin -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's\nthe end of the case. So I would like your response to\nthat logic.\nMR. THOMAS: And I would want to submit to you\ninterveningly you have had the passing of the Voting\nRights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to\nCongress. The whole spectrum of American society is in\nCongress. So if Congress is being well represented, when\nit passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a\ndifferent perspective on it.\nGoing back to 1969, some things were foreclosed\nto some of the citizens of the United States. So,\nobviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in\nSullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you\nrespectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in\nCongress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face\nof this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not\nthere.\nIf I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also\nadd as a practical consideration --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, you say it's not\nthere, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought\nit was there. Isn't that correct?\nMR. THOMAS: But -- but that's an -- an\ninvestigatory -- the administrative enforcement scenario.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but their reading of the\nstatute was that the word discrimination included a\nretaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they\ndrafted on the basis of their understanding of what\nCongress intended by using the word -- the words in this\nstatute.\nMR. THOMAS: But don't we go -- Justice Stevens,\ndon't we go back to Sandoval? Can you in a regulation do\nmore than what the statute requires?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You cannot use the regulation\nthat goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what\nthat holds. But a regulation interpreting what the\nstatute itself provides is in a different ball park. And\nthat's what I understand these regulations to have done,\nto say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.\nMR. THOMAS: But -- but again, that's\nretaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the\nappropriate office.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- I mean, Sandoval is\nvery clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very\nclear. And the key language I thought is, the language\nstatutes that focus on the person regulated rather than\nindividuals protected create no implication of an intent\nto confer the private right. So they're looking at\ndisparate impact and disparate impact, according to the\nmajority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to\nprotect the person discriminated against, but was a way of\nregulating people so they wouldn't intentionally\ndiscriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the\nsame -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it.\nThe -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here.\nThe reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not\ntrying to protect university behavior one whit more than\nthe whole underlying thing is trying to protect university\nbehavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being\nfired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we\nhave the history, we have the language, and we have that\nsentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes\ninto 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right\nof action, given Cannon, would be inferred.\nNow, what's -- what's -- that's how -- I'm\ntracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what\nyou say.\nMR. THOMAS: Well, Justice Breyer, on the face\nof the statute, I just can't get there. I apologize for\nthat, respectfully, but -- but I can't.\nAnd Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up,\ninterestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt\nv. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the\nNorthern District of Birmingham -- for the Northern\nDistrict of Alabama made very clear that an implied\nprivate right of action was not cognizable under title IX,\nand that the regulation was not a basis to follow it. And\n-- and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham,\nat very least, because the case was affirmed by the\nEleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so\nanyone who would go --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We -- we can't -- you don't\nbase your argument on giving some legal effect to denial\nof certiorari --\nMR. THOMAS: No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you.\nMR. THOMAS: But -- but to say -- I was trying\nto emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board\nwhen it accepted these Federal funds. It had no way of\nanticipating that retaliation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It had never anticipated a\nprivate right of action, even though it read the Cannon\nopinion, which was written some 20 years ago? Maybe more\nthan that. I don't remember.\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Cannon, your opinion there\nis going to be around for a long time. The scholars are\ngoing to have to debate it for years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There were some later cases\nthat cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply\nCannon anymore.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Congress itself has\nadopted the rule set forth in Cannon.\nMR. THOMAS: But -- but if I may, but then\nJustice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court --\nin his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future\nshould be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action\nabsent such specificity on the part of the legislative\nbranch. And that just speaks volumes to me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It said in this statute we\ndo, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in\nthe identical way --\nMR. THOMAS: Yes, ma'am.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- title VII -- VI\nproscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs.\nSo it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination,\nsex discrimination do have a -- a private right of action,\nand that was the holding of this Court.\nMR. THOMAS: Yes, ma'am. Well, but -- but\nagain, it goes -- goes back to -- but would that include\nretaliation? And -- and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems to me that if\nyou're talking about the sixth grade soccer team,\nrealistically the only one who is going to know anything\n-- enough and be brave enough to complain will be the\nteacher. And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it.\nYou have nice words on paper and they'll never be\nenforced.\nMR. THOMAS: But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher\ncould easily, if they don't get a positive response from\nthe administration, they can call OCR.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And OCR says, as it usually\ndoes, we're too busy. Sorry.\nMR. THOMAS: No. They -- no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Congress didn't give us\nenough money to do the job.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know that? I mean, do we\nhave any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is?\nJust because they haven't cut off funds --\nMR. THOMAS: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they may well not have cut\noff funds because anybody who gets a directive from them\nwill hop to it.\nMR. THOMAS: Justice Scalia, that's exactly it.\nI mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call,\nwe're supposed to jump. It's no doubt about it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do they call more than\ninfrequently?\nMR. THOMAS: All the time. And -- and the other\nside of that coin --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is your personal\ntestimony.\nMR. THOMAS: Yes, ma'am. Yes, it is.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. THOMAS: And -- and Justice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there is much\ntestimony on the other side that says we call and call and\nthey don't come.\nMR. THOMAS: Well, I've been in educational law\nnow almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school\nboards. So I have firsthand knowledge. I mean -- and\nI've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher\ned. I mean, when they come in, they come in.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many title IX complaints\nin your -- in your experience? You mentioned one. Is\nthere any other?\nMR. THOMAS: Two.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Two? In how many years?\nMR. THOMAS: In 26.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Two in 20-something years.\nMR. THOMAS: Yes, ma'am. But they're all\nmemorable.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. THOMAS: They're all -- thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Thomas.\nMr. Newsom.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM\nON BEHALF OF ALABAMA,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. NEWSOM: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nI'd like to address, if I may, several concerns\nthat have been raised during the -- the preceding\narguments.\nOne is to clarify some things about the scope of\nthe administrative remedy. The other side, with respect,\nwants you to think that without the implied right of\naction for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out\nin the cold. That is not true. The administrative remedy\n-- it's not just about funding termination. 34 C.F.R.\n106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems\nnecessary. The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself\ntouted its flexible approach to enforcement which\nincludes, among other things, as this Court noted in\nGebser, citing back to its earlier -- pardon me --\ndecision in North Haven, individualized relief in\nappropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh\nhimself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is\nthe threat of -- of funding termination. So while the OCR\nis wielding the club of funding termination, they can\nextract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate\ncases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do we -- do we have any -- any\nempirical evidence as to -- as to what they have thus\nleveraged?\nMR. NEWSOM: None that I am aware of, Your --\nYour Honor, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the other side says,\nlook, dead letter. What do we know about such life as\nthere may be in the letter?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well -- well, I will, I assume,\nperhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office\nto tell you what -- what the DOJ has and hasn't done.\nWhat I can tell you is that -- that the DOJ manual that\nthe other side cites throughout its briefs expressly\nencourages agencies, when enforcing these -- these things,\nto leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual\nclaimants. So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy,\nthis is far from a dead letter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't concede the\npoint that it is the role of this Court to determine\nwhether agencies are inefficient or not --\nMR. NEWSOM: Of course not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and if they are inefficient\nto -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fill\nthe void?\nMR. NEWSOM: Of course not, Justice Scalia, and\n-- and the Court knows very well from my brief that our\nposition is that when you're talking about implied rights\nof action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading\nup to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts\nof policy considerations really are not relevant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If they're not\nrelevant, do you think that the regulation which provides\n-- do you think it's unlawful?\nMR. NEWSOM: We do not contest the validity of\nthe regulation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If you don't contest the\nvalidity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think\nit's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?\nMR. NEWSOM: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is it doing?\nMR. NEWSOM: It -- section 100.7(e), the\nregulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily\nconcede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all\n-- all it does by its text -- and its structure makes\nclear all it does -- is to govern the internal processes\nof official OCR investigations. It does not go further\nthan that.\nThis Court in Sandoval was very clear that it\nwas -- that it was only authoritative interpretations of a\nstatute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that\nstatute's implied right of action.\nAnother point I want to make about the\nadministrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether\nfunds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if\nthe answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been\nwithdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that\nthe threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in\nadministrative enforcement.\nAnother point about administrative enforcement\nis whether or not there are sufficient resources. That,\nobviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably\nthe inordinate number of complaints about core,\ntraditional discrimination. But as the other side has\nmade clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the\npetitioner's brief -- and then there's a brief filed on\nbehalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this\nout in some detail -- there just aren't many of these\nretaliation claims out there, either in the -- either --\neither in the judicial system or at OCR.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why is that, do you think?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, my -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it because no remedy is\navailable, or is it because there are just very few\ninstances giving rise to such?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, I think in all likelihood, it\nis the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court\nwould presume -- would not presume ill of local school\ndistricts and -- and even State universities, but would\npresume that they are complying with, if not clearly\narticulated law, certainly good public policy.\nThe second point is that what the -- the absence\nof private actions for retaliation shows is that title\nIX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without\nthe implied right of action.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we decide this case on the\nassumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a\ncomplaint of violation of title IX?\nMR. NEWSOM: Certainly, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We should decide it on that\nassumption?\nMR. NEWSOM: You have to take as true, of\ncourse, the facts as pledged in the -- as pleaded in the\ncomplaint.\nAnother point I'd like to make briefly is about\nthe comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to\nlook very closely at title VII when you're -- whether it's\non the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's\nsex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact\nthat it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation\nin a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I\ndidn't -- I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during\nthe first argument. I had my head in my own book, but\nwhat I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the -- the\n-- an instance in which Congress has a choice of two\nmodels for -- for constructing a statute, and it chooses\none over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to\nallow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened\nhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Like the choice it made in\n1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX,\nit knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute\nin its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking\nresemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983.\nSo if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would\nbe that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation\nthat came in '64 and '65.\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, if -- if I could answer in\ntwo parts. First, to say that I think what was going on\nin 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have\nCongress in title VII addressing itself both to\ndiscrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI,\npassed as part of the same piece of legislation,\naddressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use\nJustice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title\nVI model and not the title VII model.\nNow, to get to your question specifically, I\nthink, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question,\nSullivan -- I think there are a number of problems with\nthe other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all\ndue respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty\nopaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing\nlights a principle that every anti-discrimination\nprovision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It says if you're thrown out\nof the club because you champion the rights of a black\nman, you have a right to sue under this statute.\nMR. NEWSOM: Even if I were to grant your\nassumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I\npresume, would not agree with -- he was left sort of\nscratching his head trying to figure out what the Court\nwas trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if\n1982 can be construed that way, that -- that construction\ndoes not necessarily carry over to every anti-\ndiscrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different\nlanguage to begin with and, more importantly, is -- is\npassed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth\nAmendment, which is the broadest conceivable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it did construe the\nword discrimination, didn't it?\nMR. NEWSOM: No, sir. Discrimination is not\neven in -- is not even in title -- rather, in 1982. So\nthe language is very different --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On account of race is in it.\nRight?\nMR. NEWSOM: I'll have to confess I don't -- it\ndoes say something like every person shall have the same\nright as -- dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the\n-- the language frankly is pretty different, and the more\nfundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if\nthat's true for -- for that statute passed under that\nconstitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice\nKennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument\nabout a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that\nconditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express,\nand it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would\nhave gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can\nimagine --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me they would get\nit when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare,\nand agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible\nschool board would say, well, we've got only one sentence\nin the statute. We better look at the regulations to find\nout what's required.\nMR. NEWSOM: I agree, and -- and if -- and if\nthe Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the\nregulation here, what it would have found is a regulation\nnot that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but\ninstead that -- that manages the internal operating\nprocedures for official agency investigations. So to be\nsure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not\nretaliate in -- in the business of an official OCR\ninvestigation, and if it did, it would be subject to\nadministrative enforcement, but it was -- it was not on\nnotice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-\nretaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it\nviolated any such nonexistent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's -- we're not talking\nabout the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What\nmust you do to comply? And it has in there you don't\nretaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly\ntake the position, well, the -- the regulations tell us we\ndon't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency\nbreathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front\nof us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have\nknown the statute meant don't retaliate.\nMR. NEWSOM: And -- and with respect, I think\nthere is a difference, particularly given the clear notice\nrequirements that this Court has -- has used in Spending\nClause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR\ninvestigation and retaliation generally, but -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I really don't get that.\nIf the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate,\nthat's one of the things we're going -- that's going to be\non our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't\nretaliate.\nMR. NEWSOM: Justice Stevens, may I respond?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. NEWSOM: Even granting your assumption,\nJustice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the\n-- is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to -- to\na private right of action for damages and fees even in --\nin the event that there were some generally applicable\nanti-retaliation provision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Newsom.\nMR. NEWSOM: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger, you have about\n3 and a half minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DELLINGER: I should make it clear that\nwe're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause\nof action. We're asking the Court to interpret the cause\nof action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v.\nthe University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress.\nIt was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval. And\nwhen you look at the scope of that -- of that prohibition,\nthat cause of action, why would it not extend to\nretaliation? The idea that you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Other statutes do it\nseparately.\nMR. DELLINGER: I understand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Other statutes don't view the\none as -- as being incorporated in the other.\nMR. DELLINGER: The practice of Congress has not\nbeen consistent on incorporating express provisions\nsometimes because of language differences, but there are\nhalf a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have\nconsistently assumed included retaliation as part of\ndiscrimination. Section 1981, section 1982, title VI,\n1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the\nRehabilitation Act have all been construed that way.\nAnd why would they not? The notion that you\nhave to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of\nChicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her\non the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and\nexpel her for complaining about your admissions policy\nmakes no sense.\nIn this case, relying upon the vagaries of what\nany administration might do about enforcement is not\nnecessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this\nCourt's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it\nfrankly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are no vagaries in\nprivate enforcement. Private attorneys general always act\nin the interest of the whole polity. There are no\nvagaries there.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, in this case, it has been\nknown to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to\nbring them about by allowing people to step forward. The\nlast point they make is that even if there's a cause of\naction, and even if the cause of action covers\nretaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because\nhe's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination.\nThat makes no sense in law or in logic.\nIf the captain of the boys' basketball team\njoins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a\nsupportive way to say, they're just not treating girls'\nbasketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended\nfrom their teams or dropped from the honor society in\nretaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have --\nthey've both been discriminated against on the basis of\nsex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination\nor neither is.\nAnd in this case, it's going to be critically\nimportant that this valuable statute, which has meant so\nmuch for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to\nhave people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that\nthey've got a right that they can enforce that will allow\nthem to come forward within the school itself and try to\nrectify these anomalies in and under title IX.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.\n"
