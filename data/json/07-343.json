        "content": "(10:20 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 07-343, Kennedy versus\nLouisiana.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis country has not executed anyone for a\nrape of any kind in over 43 years. Louisiana's attempt\nto reintroduce this practice into American society\nviolates the Eighth Amendment for two distinct reasons.\nFirst, a long-standing national consensus\nexists against it. Indeed, Louisiana's capital rape law\nis particularly at odds with national values because\nLouisiana is the only State in which Petitioner, as a\nnon-recidivist, could be subject to the death penalty.\nSecond, Louisiana's law violates this\nCourt's Eighth Amendment-narrowing jurisprudence. It\ngives juries unfettered discretion to choose who, among\nthe vast class of offenders convicted of child rape, may\nbe subject to the death penalty. Now, this is in stark\ncontrast to the handful of other States that have\ncapital rape laws that they've recently enacted. Texas,\nfor example, requires an offender to have served a prior\nsentence for the same crime of 25 years before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Our jurisprudence just\nrequires the narrowing of the death penalty to be -- to\nparticularly heinous crimes. And one could say that\nrape is in and of itself particularly heinous, rape of a\nchild of 12 or under.\nMR. FISHER: It's no doubt a serious crime,\nJustice Scalia, but I believe this Court's narrowing\njurisprudence requires narrowing beyond a particularly\nheinous crime. Of course, in Godfrey and Gregg against\nGeorgia, this Court said that deliberate murder is not\non its own enough to subject an offender to the death\npenalty.\nSo there's two problems that arise with\nLouisiana's statute in the context of this Court's\nnarrowing jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How would you describe a\nparticularly heinous rape of a child under 12? What\nwould make it particularly heinous?\nMR. FISHER: Well, there could be several\naggravating facts that would make a rape of a child, or\nindeed of any person, a particularly egregious crime,\nbut in Coker against Georgia, this Court did not simply\nhold that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the\ndeath penalty for the crime of rape; it held that this\nCourt -- that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing\nthe death penalty for rape with aggravating\ncircumstances.\nRemember in Coker against Georgia, there\nwere two aggravating circumstances in that case. First,\nthe offender was a recidivist. He had been convicted of\nrape three times, was a convicted murder who had escaped\nfrom prison. Second, he committed the rape in the\ncourse of committing other very serious felonies,\nincluding kidnapping and robbery.\nAnd so, at the very minimum, the State\nstands here with the burden today to say that an average\nchild rape is worse than the crime in Coker, that this\nCourt held was not sufficiently superior --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the\nState says that all recidivist rapists of children under\n12 will suffer the death penalty. Does it have to\nnarrow that class further? I mean, the need for\nnarrowing depends upon how narrow the class is described\nin the first place. Right?\nMR. FISHER: If --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if the law says you\nhave to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other\nfactors that you just mentioned, if the law said that,\nwould you come in and say, \"Oh, no, you can't just give\neverybody who commits that crime the death penalty\"?\nYou have to narrow the class.\nMR. FISHER: Well, no question that would be\na much stronger argument under this Court's narrowing\njurisprudence. Now, you'd still be left with two\nproblems with that kind of a statute: First, you'd\nstill potentially be left with the problem that this\nCourt addressed in Furman and all the subsequent cases\nof having a large class of offenders of which only a few\nget the death penalty. Now, there needs to be some\nreason to differentiate.\nThe State might well say -- especially the\nState of Texas and other States that have these very\nsevere recidivist requirements might say that is good\nenough, but they'd still be left with the -- with the\nargument that they would have to make that a person who\nconvicts -- who commits child rape and does not -- it\ndoes not result any death, is a worse offender than\nsomebody who deliberately kills somebody --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. What if --\nMR. FISHER: -- on average.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if, instead, the State\nsimply defined the class as the class of those who\ncommit rape, and then listed as an aggravating\ncircumstance the rape of a child under 12 years old?\nThat would be perfectly consistent with the narrowing\njurisprudence, wouldn't it?\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure it would,\nJustice Souter. Remember Coker tells us, I think, that\nyou can't simply start with rape and then add an\naggravating circumstance, in terms of this Court's\nEighth Amendment jurisprudence. But even if you're\nasking, just in terms --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go over that,\nMr. Fisher? Because the -- there was a plurality\nopinion, right, in Coker? And Justice Powell wrote\nseparately, and I thought he left open an outrageous\nrape resulting in serious, lasting harm to the victim.\nHe said that the Coker jury was not asked\nand could not have found from the facts in that case\nthat the offense was outrageous or want only violent in\nthat it involved a aggravated battery. So you don't\nhave an opinion of five Justices saying that, in any and\nall circumstances, rape that leaves the victim alive\ncannot be punished by the death penalty.\nMR. FISHER: Let me first say that the State\nhasn't alleged those things that Justice Powell\nidentified. So, even if Justice Powell's opinion\ncontrolled, I think we would prevail here. But remember\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm questioning -- you're\nsaying it's off the chart because the Court held that\nyou cannot have a death penalty for rape. And I\nsuggested that that's not so clear.\nMR. FISHER: Well, my understanding of this\nCourt's Marks rule is that the narrowest opinion that\ncommands a majority -- so Justice Powell's opinion was\nactually a seventh vote. If you count the two Justices\non this Court who held the death penalty was\nunconstitutional across the board and add the four that\nconstituted the plurality in Coker, we think the\nplurality opinion becomes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a --\nMR. FISHER: -- the controlling one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's strange way of\nmaking a majority, isn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Two people who think even\nthe death penalty for murder is no good, they're going\nto form the majority of people who consider whether a\nlawful death penalty can be imposed for rape. I think\nat least in those circumstances, you have to discount\nthe people who would not allow the death penalty under\nany circumstances for any crime.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not aware of any\nwrinkle in this Court's jurisprudence that says that if\na Justice is too far out of the mainstream that their\nvote is discounted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He --\nMR. FISHER: But I want to try to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He -- he is not considering\nthe issue that is before the Court. The issue before\nthe Court is whether -- whether a permissible death\npenalty can be imposed for this crime. These parties\nsay there's no such thing as a permissible death\npenalty. I mean, it would be -- if that wrinkle isn't\nthere, we should iron it in pretty quickly.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At any rate --\nMR. FISHER: Fair enough.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were four justices\non the plurality opinion. That was the only point I\nwanted to make.\nMR. FISHER: Okay. Thank you. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even -- even with respect\nto -- now, I'm asking you to --\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to forget my question\nagain for a minute.\nMR. FISHER: Okay. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even on the plurality\nanalysis, your argument, as I understand it is, if there\nis any question left in Coker, in effect it's answered\nby Enmund/Tison.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right, and it's\nalso answered by simply the empirics across the country\nright now, if you did nothing more than applied the\nRoper and Atkins cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but then that's a\ndifferent reason.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, speaking of\nRoper and Atkins, is it -- is it only work in one way?\nHow are you ever supposed to get consensus moving in the\nopposite direction? In other words, you look to the\nnumber of States under Roper and Atkins who impose it,\nand you say, well, most of them are abolishing it, so we\nthink it's unconstitutional, combined with other\nfactors.\nNow, if there's going to be a trend the\nother way, how does that happen? As soon as the first\nState says, well, we're going to impose the death\npenalty for child rape, you say, well, there isn't a\nconsensus, so it's unconstitutional. And do 20 States\nhave to get together and do it at the same time? Or how\nare they supposed to move the inquiry under Atkins and\nRoper in the opposite direction?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it's possible,\nbut this Court has understood -- I think well understood\nthat it is a practical problem. It is one that gives\nthis Court caution before ruling a law unconstitutional.\nHere, I don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice.\nMR. FISHER: -- you're going to need to\ngravel --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I say that's nice. We're\nin effect -- in effect prohibiting the people from\nchanging their mind.\nMR. FISHER: I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- about what justify's the\ndeath penalty.\nMR. FISHER: I don't think that's\nnecessarily the case, Justice Scalia. And, of course,\nthere are narrower ways to decide this case that could\nleave open the possibility of future developments.\nBut, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to answer\nyour question and say I think there may be a\nmisunderstanding that this Court really needs to address\nthat in this case, because we have had, since 1995 when\nthe State of Louisiana passed this law and the year\nafter when the supreme court of Louisiana upheld it in a\nvery widely covered opinion from which this Court denied\ncertiorari, there has been a national debate for 12 or\n13 years already as to the propriety of imposing\nthe death --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the trend since\n1995, '90, has been more and more States are passing\nstatutes imposing the death penalty in situations that\ndo not result in death.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right. You have\nto ask yourself the question whether that is enough.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't we say in Atkins\nthat it's the trend that counts; it's not the number?\nMR. FISHER: I think this Court said in\nAtkins --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The trend -- the trendy\nexpression hoist by your own petard: The trend here is\nclearly in the direction of permitting more and more --\nof more and more States permitting the capital\npunishment for this crime.\nMR. FISHER: Clearly, I think that Atkins\nand Roper look at trend among other things. And I think\nit is important to remember that there were 20 States in\neach of those cases that allowed the death penalty under\nthose circumstances, but I think we have to ask\nourselves whether the movement that's occurred over the\npast dozen years is enough to matter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me ask --\nwe will put that to one side, but how much movement you\nneed.\nI'm more interested in the analytic\nquestion: How does it happen? I mean because your\nposition would be every one -- a case in every one of\nthose States, whatever the number is, is\nunconstitutional because we've said the trend is the\nother way.\nWell, how does a trend ever get started in\nthe opposite direction?\nMR. FISHER: Well, as it happened here,\nStates can pass laws, and they can bring prosecutions\npotentially reaching --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you want to say\nthis is -- you want to say this is unconstitutional\nbecause most States do it the other way. And I assume\nif a similar case arose in Texas involving capital\npunishment in a nondeath case, you would say well, most\ngo the other way. In other words, if you knock them\ndown one by one, it is kind of hard to get a trend\ngoing.\nMR. FISHER: Well, a State could do\nsomething like what Georgia has done, which is pass a\nlaw that says that the death penalty is permissible in a\ngiven crime -- in, for example, rape -- to the extent\nallowed by the United States Supreme Court, which is the\nextent allowed by the Eighth Amendment.\nIf several States pass laws like that,\neventually this Court even -- let's say the Court\ndecides this case in my favor today. Eventually this\nCourt could take notice of that and take certiorari and\nagain decide whether or not the Eighth Amendment was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't even have to say\n\"the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court.\"\nThey can pass a law that seems to contradict a prior\nopinion of ours; can't they?\nMR. FISHER: Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Abraham Lincoln should they\ncould, anyway.\nMR. FISHER: There's no double about that,\nand it happens frequently. Now I want to ask about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If somebody in this\ncase is tried and convicted under that law, you would\nsay: Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not\na sufficient trend in favor of that.\nAnd it just seems to me that that\nunderstanding of Atkins and Roper prevents the\ndevelopment of the law except in one direction.\nMR. FISHER: As I said, it may be\npractically difficult, but it's not impossible, because\nthis Court could eventually take notice of what it was\nseeing. Now, I think it is important to ask --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a brief in this\ncase on behalf of several States, and the argument\nthat's made in that brief on the point that the Chief\nJustice has raised is we can never know whether there is\na consensus one way or another so long as Coker seems to\ncover the waterfront, so long as Coker admits of the\ninterpretation that you cannot have the death penalty\nfor rape, period.\nSo the argument is on this question -- not\ntalking about the universe of crimes, but as to rape --\nwe cannot know if there is a consensus one way or\nanother until this Court clarifies what Coker stands\nfor.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I think there\nare two problems with that. First, it is a theoretical\nargument that doesn't have any factual underpinning.\nThere is no evidence in any State legislature that Coker\nhas stood in the way of enacting statutes like this.\nAnd, again, I want to emphasize to this\nCourt to remember, if there were any overhang or\ndistorting effect of Coker, it certainly would have gone\naway by 1996 when the Louisiana supreme court laid out a\nvery detailed opinion explaining why a law like this\ncould be constitutional and, in effect, exhorting other\nStates to pass laws like it.\nAnd so for a dozen years in death-penalty\njurisdictions there has been a very vigorous effort by\nproponents of these laws to get statutes like this\npassed. And look what we end up with. Mr. Chief\nJustice, I want to bring myself back to your trend\nquestion. What we end up with is exactly the same\nnumber of States allowing the death penalty here as\nallowed it in Coker in 1977.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but, as I\npointed out, it is very expensive to run a regime in\nwhich you have the death penalty. And I can see the\nlegislators in those States saying, well, we've got\nCoker on the books. We've only got one State. Why\nwould we want to be the second State and go through this\nprocess and then have the Supreme Court throw it out?\nYou know, everyone is waiting for the next State.\nI mean it's a very difficult process, it\nseems to me, to run the evolution of the law in both\ndirections. And then if you're insisting on a trend of\nwhatever -- I don't know what the number is, 15, or 20,\nor 30 States -- it just can't materialize when you have\nCoker there and you have Atkins looking only in one\ndirection.\nMR. FISHER: There are, no doubt, various\nlegislative considerations. I just would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really think that if\nthis Court held in the present case that the death\npenalty can be imposed for the rape of a child under 12,\ndo you really think that the trend would not continue,\nthat there would not be more States to enact such a\npenalty?\nMR. FISHER: Oh, absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That there would be more?\nMR. FISHER: No. Absolutely, I think that\nit would not continue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That it would not.\nMR. FISHER: If -- and I think it is\nimportant to understand not just the Louisiana supreme\ncourt; but in 2004, when Patrick Kennedy was put on\ndeath row in Louisiana, in light of this Court's Atkins\nand Roper jurisprudence, notice was served in all\ndeath-penalty jurisdictions that if you want a law like\nthis, you've got a few years to pass it before this case\ngets to the Supreme Court.\nI think that's why you have seen an uptick\nof two or there other States passing laws in the last\ncouple of years. But, again, all that has done is\nrecreate the situation this Court faced in 1977 in\nCoker, where six States would have allowed the death\npenalty for child rape.\nAnd in Roper this Court emphasized that it\nwould be very ironic to find a trend or a lack of\nmovement dispositive if the reason for that action more\nrecently is because long ago society recognized that\nthis was an improper punishment and this Court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that all these\nother States, if told that it is permissible to have the\ndeath penalty for child rape at least under some\ncircumstances, would come to the conclusion that the\nworst case of child rape that can be envisioned is still\nless heinous than any murder that qualifies for the\ndeath penalty?\nMR. FISHER: I think they may well,\nJustice Alito. It's important to recognize not just --\nwell, in Roper this Court said -- I think it addressed a\nsimilar question. There has to be a line somewhere in\nterms of the Eighth Amendment.\nNow, we can imagine a terribly serious case\nwith a juvenile offender who is 17 years old, for\nexample, but drawing a line in a place that makes sense\nalmost all of the time is the best we can do. If a\nState were to come up and make the argument today that:\nImagine the most heinous child rape you can, first of\nall, it wouldn't say that under the narrowing problem\nbecause of Maynard against Cartwright.\nBut, more importantly, other States would\nbeg to differ. Look at Utah. Utah thinks the next most\nserious crime after murder is assault, an aggravated\nassault on a prison guard. South Dakota thinks the next\nmost serious crime after murder is aggravated\nkidnapping.\nOnce you roll the line back from the line\nestablished in Coker, which is requiring the death of\nthe victim, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to\nfigure out where the line is going to be drawn for\nEighth Amendment purposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wonder if Atkins\nand Roper are qualitatively different, considering the\nmental retardation of the offender, the youth of the\noffender. Those are issues that go, as we said in Roper\nand Atkins, to culpability. In other words, they are\nfocused on the offender.\nThis is quite different. It is focused on\nthe nature of the offense. And I wonder if that's more\nsomething on which we have less basis for determining\nthe issue than a legislature. We can look at the\nquestion of characteristics of the offender and make a\njudgment about that. I don't know how we decide this\nfor the reason you were just saying: What crimes are\nmore serious than others?\nI wonder if it brings into play our\njurisprudence on things like the three-strikes law and\nothers where we sort of say: We can't judge how serious\ncrimes are and which ones are more serious than others,\nand so we leave that to another branch.\nMR. FISHER: Well, this Court has always\ndifferentiated its proportionality analysis from capital\nto a non-capital context. In Coker, Enmund, Tison, all\nof those cases, rest to a significant degree on the\nseriousness of the crime. I think perhaps the best\ndiscussion is made --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about treason? What\nabout treason? Even the countries of Europe which have\njoined the European Convention on Human Rights, I\nbelieve they make an exception to the prohibition of the\ndeath penalty for treason. You can slaughter your\nfellow citizens, but if you offend the State you can be\nput to death.\nIs treason an exception from the -- our ban\non the death penalty except for murder?\nMR. FISHER: Well, of course, this Court has\nnever answered that, but I think there is every reason\nto believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there a Federal\ntreason statute?\nMR. FISHER: Of course. There is every\nreason to believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that doesn't require\nmurder; does it?\nMR. FISHER: No, it does not. It requires a\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's\nunconstitutional?\nMR. FISHER: No, Your Honor. And I think if\nanyone thought that the treason laws were implicated\nhere, you might have different parties before the Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think treason is\nworse than child rape?\nMR. FISHER: Well, Blackstone thought\ntreason was more serious than murder. It has\ntraditionally been the most serious crime that a person\ncan commit, and I think historically, as well at\nnationally, that is still the sentiment that is shared.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we're talking\nabout --\nMR. FISHER: Now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if were talking\nabout evolving trends, I think it's fair to say that\nsociety's recognition of the seriousness of the crime of\nrape has evolved even since, the period since Coker.\nNow isn't that something that we should take\ninto consideration?\nMR. FISHER: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It certainly\ninvolved -- evolved since the time of Blackstone and\neven since -- as I say, even since Coker. So while\nCoker may have thought rape of an adult wasn't serious\nenough to warrant the death penalty when the legislature\nhad made a contrary determination, perhaps that would be\naddressed differently if -- differently today; and\ncertainly rape of a child would be understood not to be\nnot included in Coker's analysis.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I don't think societal\nattitudes have changed very much. But to the extent any\nof it has, what this Court said in Atkins is you look to\nthe expertise of professional organizations; and I think\nit is relevant here that if the State stands up and says\nwell, the reason why we are doing this is because of\nmore enlightened attitudes about the harm that occurs in\nchild rape, all of the professional organizations sex\nassault groups, social workers, and the like that deal\nwith that crime, like here in the amicus --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The plurality opinion in\nCoker said this: Life is over for the victim of the\nmurderer. For the rape victim, life may not be nearly\nso happy as it was. Now, you think that's something\nthat would be written today?\nMR. FISHER: Perhaps not. I don't know. I\nmean, this Court chooses its words -- other parts of the\nCoker decision I think make clear that the Court\nunderstood that rape was an extraordinarily serious\ncrime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was, at least in\nthe amici briefs in Coker -- may not have been explicit\nin the Court's decision -- but the argument was made\nthat the rape law in question, the Georgia law, came\nfrom an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as\nas good as dead once she was raped; and the crime was\nthought to be an offense against her husband or her\nfather as much as it was to her. And that was the\nbackground of Coker, plus the racial element in it was\nvery strong.\nI imagine that that -- if the question were\n-- the Coker question were to come up again, those would\nstill be factors. I mean, the notion was that making\nrape equivalent to murder was no kindness to women,\nbecause it said once you've been raped, you're spoiled.\nThat's not -- there's no parallel with child\nrape.\nSo I think that what was going on under the\nsurface in Coker is quite different.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I think,\nalthough not with the same historical pedigree, the same\nargument is being put forward by the State today, that\nby definition, for a child to have been raped is\ntantamount to having been killed, and the social workers\nand sex assault experts here today I think are telling\nyou with this one voice, we very much want to\navoid sending --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it isn't\nthe notion that she's somebody else's property; and --\nwhich was the history of the rape statutes.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's fair enough,\nJustice Ginsburg, but I think also I'd like -- perhaps\nJustice Alito was right, that looking at the Court's\nopinion gives us the best indication of the analysis;\nand I think the parts that you were reading are from the\nearlier part of the opinion where the Court was saying\nthat rape in general is not as serious as murder, but\nthe end of the plurality win in Coker is very emphatic.\nIt says, that doesn't end the question, because we have\ntwo very serious aggravating circumstances and this is a\nparticularly serious incident of rape.\nEven then, the Court's words were, that does\nnot change the fact that the victim is not killed. So\nthat is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Coker, of course,\nrepeatedly in the statement of the facts and the\nanalysis, repeatedly referred to the victim as an adult\nwoman. It seems to me the Court was taking -- was being\nvery careful to leave open the question of what would be\nthe analysis in the case of a child.\nMR. FISHER: We don't argue otherwise. We\nunderstand Coker says adult woman. What we're saying is\nthat the rationale of Coker, and not just the rationale\nrequiring somebody to have died, but also the objective\nrationale in Coker, of saying we understand in the past\nfour, five years, there's been a handful; of States that\nhave come forward with laws like this but we nonetheless\nfind a national consensus against it. Look at the\nnumbers in Coker. You had 30 people on death row over\nthe span of five or six years for rape, as compared to\nthis case, you have two people on death row over a span\nof 13 years. Even the practices on the ground indicate\nquite strongly that society and even Louisiana -- look\nat Louisiana where in direct contrast to the way they\nprosecute murder cases, in which it is common for the\nprosecution to take the position that the death penalty\nis the only appropriate punishment for this crime, they\noffer life imprisonment. They've offered life in prison\nin every single child rape case they've prosecuted in\nthe in the last 13 years.\nThe only reason you have Patrick Kennedy\nhere today and one other offender on death row is\nbecause they insisted on their innocence.\nIf there are no further questions, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Fisher, your white\nlight is on, and you do want to protect your rebuttal\nright, but you began by indicating that this statute\ncould be narrowed. It could be narrowed by a\nrequirement of recidivist behavior. Are there any other\nnarrowing categories?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think there are two\nways to decide this case on more narrow grounds, I'll\noffer this answer to your question. First, this Court\ncould say that Louisiana is the only State that doesn't\nrequire recidivism, so it fails the substantive Tison -\nRoper analysis. It could also say that -- that\nLouisiana's law isn't sufficiently narrow. Yes,\nJustice Kennedy, I think if the question is could there\nbe another particularly heinous circumstance that you,\njust in the context of narrowing would be enough, one\nmight imagine other aggravating circumstances.\nCoker wouldn't be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would they be?\nMR. FISHER: One could imagine something\nlike torture or extraordinarily serious harm in a case,\nsomething like that. But again, that would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you do view\nrecidivism? I mean, I assume even if you don't oppose\nthe death penalty, you're going to get a good number of\nyears, right? So you are going to be 40 years in\nprison, come out and do it again? I don't think so.\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure what the question\nis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it is an\nunrealistic condition that you have raped a 12-year -- a\nchild twice. The first time you do it and are convicted\nof it, you'll be sent up for long enough that you won't\nhave the chance to do it a second time.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right, Justice\nScalia. Perhaps the States want to speak to that.\nThey're the ones that put it in their law. But it\nreinforces --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was 25 years, right?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, in Texas and a couple of\nother States. I think it reinforces the fact that they\nthink that by and large child rape is not serious enough\neven in those States to trigger the death penalty, and\nso they're looking for an extraordinarily small class.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nMs. Clark.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIET L. CLARK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case involves the very savage rape of\nan 8-year-old child by her stepfather. He raped her so\nbrutally that he tore her entire perineal opening from\nher vaginal opening and to her anal opening. He tore\nher vagina on the interior such that it separated\npartially from her cervix and allowed her rectum to\nprotrude into her vagina. Invasive emergency surgery\nwas required to repair these injuries. It is\nLouisiana's position that the cruel and unusual\npunishment clause of the Eighth Amendment does not\npreclude the State of Louisiana from --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you just clarify\nabout the -- were those injuries permanent?\nMS. CLARK: Your Honor, those injuries,\nafter surgery they did heal. So the surgery was\nrequired to repair them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They were not permanent\ninjuries.\nMS. CLARK: In the sense that they healed,\nthat's correct, Your Honor. But I think that was a\nperformance injury inflicted upon a child wants -- just\npsychologically and mentally as well as physically.\nAs an initial matter, I would like to\naddress the Coker question. I think that it is quite\nclear that Coker was limited to the rape of an adult\nwoman. There are at lease 14 separate references in the\nopinion to an adult woman or to an adult female. The\nonly reference --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Both -- both sides have\nsomething of a dilemma with Coker, because if you say\nthat it does not control this case, then the consensus\nor the lack of consensus -- or the consensus is more\nreliable. If you say it does control this case, then\nthe consensus is not so reliable; and both sides have\nthat duality that they have to confront.\nMS. CLARK: Yes, Your Honor, I understand\nthat -- that sort of a tension, Justice Kennedy, and I\nthink for the defendant, he's the one asking the Court\nto create this broad categorical restriction and he's\nsaying that it clearly precludes it. At the same time\nhe's saying that States have -- have responded to -- to\nCoker, that somehow that -- the fact that there's not a\ngreater existence of the rape of a child rape laws is\nsomehow not controlled by the fact that it has been\nmisinterpreted, and he point out in his brief several\ninstances of courts where they specifically misinterpret\nthat holding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no -- there is\ndoubt in my mind that this particular kind of crime has\nnot been the subject of a Supreme Court opinion. My\nproblem is I can think of many, many awful, truly\nhorrible circumstances that categorized in many\ndifferent -- under many different criminal statutes; I'm\nnot a moralist. I'm a judge. As a judge, I look at the\nlaw. It seems for 43 years, no one has been executed\nbut for murder.\nMoreover, this Court has never approved the\nexecution for any crime other than murder in those 43\nyears. Right.\nIf I accept your argument, since I'm not a\nmoralist, since I can think of horrible things all over\nthe place, have I then opened the door so that, in fact,\nStates will find lots of different crimes which are\nseriously horrible; and suddenly, we will be in the\nbusiness of creating under the Constitution some kind of\nhighly complex categorization, really a moral\ncategorization of crime, method of commitment, method\nof, et cetera, et cetera.\nMS. CLARK: Your Honor, I think the\nConstitution by only precluding cruel and unusual\npunishment leaves open the possibility that there are\ncertain crimes that by their nature are so heinous that\nthe death penalty --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the answer is yes? Your\nanswer is if we take your position and that's -- I'm not\nsaying it's not a good argument, just take your\nposition, but if we take your position, I can think of\ninstances of kidnapping; I can think of instances of\ntorture. I can think of instances all over the place\nwhich are truly horrible.\nBut then to take your position, what we're\ngoing to do is we are going to say legislatures all over\nthe country do have the right under the Constitution to\ngo, try to categorize horrible by horrible, not just\ndeath. Not just murder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just the way they used to.\nMS. CLARK: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Perhaps at the time, 200\nyears ago, that's true.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CLARK: I think we have to recognize\nthat with child rape there is something very unique and\nhorrible about this crime. It's not true of every\nkidnapping. It's not true --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's not true -- I've\nread the definition of section 41 of rape under the\nLouisiana code. I won't repeat it but it's very broad.\nAnd it can broad in the sense that rape itself can\ninclude a vast number of instances of child molesting,\neach of which is bad; but there are degrees. So I\nsuppose that child molesting of all those kinds that are\nlisted in 41 (c) (1) and (2), which you know I'm sure,\nwould count as rape if committed on a person under 12.\nSome are absolutely horrible. Some are just bad. But\nthat's what the other side means when he says it gives\ntremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and\nchoose who should be executed needs further narrowing.\nWhat's your response.\nMS. CLARK: Your Honor, I'm slightly\nconfused as to what you're referring to in terms of a\nwide variety of acts, because Louisiana Revised Statute\n14:42 that Patrick Kennedy was convicted under, it only\nprovides that he could be convicted of aggravated rape\nof a child under 12 where he had anal intercourse or\nvaginal intercourse with that child. Those are the only\ntwo methods --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those are the only two. So\nthese other things don't count.\nMS. CLARK: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMS. CLARK: Only anal or vaginal rape. And\nI would submit that that is in itself a very narrow\ncrime. This is fundamentally different, I think, from\nhomicide, where in homicide the narrowing was required\nbecause homicides were committed under circumstances\nwhere the offender himself perhaps lacks intent to kill\ntraditionally, but accidentally committed the murder\nduring the course of another felony. Or where the\noffender himself acted with reckless disregard but\nanother person committed it during the course of the\nfelony.\nSo there was a wide variety of intents with\nwhich the crime was committed. There was a wide range\nof circumstances under which the crime was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Clark, what do you do\nwith the requirement that our cases have imposed? It is\nnot a requirement I agree with, but it is certainly one\nour cases have imposed, that you cannot leave -- leave\nit to the jury whether to impose the death penalty or\nnot even for murder, but rather you have to narrow the\nclass of people who have committed that particular crime\nso that -- so that the imposition won't be random.\nAlthough later, we say you have to let the jury consider\nany mitigating factory which makes it random; but\nnonetheless, our cases do say you have to narrow the\nclass of murderers who can be given the death penalty.\nWouldn't the same apply to the class of\nchild rapists?\nMS. CLARK: No, Your Honor. I think the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not.\nMS. CLARK: The point that I was trying to\nmake about murder about the category being so broad, the\nclass being so broad, the range of actions being so\nbroad that when the Court was looking at -- in Furman --\nwhat kind of homicides -- how do we know whether -- why\nthis person is getting the death penalty and why this\nperson isn't, what is the standard that guides it, they\nwere looking at situations where murders like the -- ini\nFurman his actions were described as tripping over a\nwire as you left the house and accidently shooting the\nhomeowner through the front door.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think intentional\nmurder of a -- of a law officer would need no further\nnarrowing?\nMS. CLARK: That's correct, Your Honor. In\nLouisiana law we define -- we have deliberate murder, a\nlaw enforcement official, and that by the category of\nthe victim that is at stake there that crime is\nnarrowed, and that is provided for in Louisiana law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it\nsufficient -- why isn't it sufficient narrowing, even\nafter Coker, that they make the death eligibility rape\nof a child under 12 as opposed to under 16?\nMS. CLARK: That is. That's further\nnarrowing. It is, Your Honor. What I'm saying is it is\nnot clear from this Court's jurisprudence that narrowing\nwould be required in a non-homicide circumstance to\nbegin with, especially one where here we have defined\nthe offense so narrowly that it is -- that under the law\nthat Patrick Kennedy was convicted it was only children\nunder 12. Those kind of offenses, rapes under those\ncircumstances are not committed accidentally. They're\nnever committed without some form of premediation and\ndeliberation. It's just something that is fundamentally\nand uniquely different for murder.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to your -- to\nyour answer on the murder question? And that was you\nsaid there's -- there's a murder analog to this narrow\ndefinition, and you gave the example of the murder of\nthe law enforcement officer. And that raises a question\nthat I had about how Lowenfield ought to be read.\nThe example that you gave was one of the\nfive instances which the Court said out in the\nLowenfield opinion quoting the Louisiana statute. In\neach of those five instances, nothing need be proved\nexcept, as you have put it, the narrowing circumstance\nin the law enforcement officer in your example. But\nunder the Louisiana statute which passed muster in\nLowenfield, there were five analogs of which the law\nenforcement officer was one.\nEach of those crimes was defined as a\nkilling with a specific intent to kill or specific\nintent to inflict great bodily harm. And then in each\none of these instances, there was an extra element\nadded: Law enforcement officer, intent to kill more\nthan three people in Lowenfield, and so on. In fact,\nchild under 12 was one of the examples.\nIt seems to me that the -- one way to read\nthe Louisiana statute there consistently with the --\nwith the value that Justice Scalia's question raised is\nthis: That Louisiana, in effect, had created a general\ncrime of murder with specific intent to kill or inflict\ngreat bodily harm. And then it had given five instances\nin which, as I put it a moment ago, there was an extra\nelement: And that extra element, whether it be killing\nmore than two people, whether it be killing a child\nunder 12, law enforcement officer, functioned like the\naggravating circumstance; so that, in fact, we didn't\nhave a statute that merely said if you kill a law\nofficer intentionally, that's capital, period.\nWhat we had was a capital scheme that says\nif you kill with specific intent to kill or inflict\ngreat bodily harm, that's murder. And if you commit one\nof these other five other elements, that narrows it down\nto capital murder.\nIsn't that a proper way of reading the\nLouisiana murder statute from which you took your\nexample? And if it is, isn't that example inconsistent\nwith the theory that you're arguing here that you can\nsimply define child rape as capital and let it go at\nthat?\nMS. CLARK: No, Your Honor. I think if I --\nif I understand what you're asking, with regard to\nmurder again, murder traditionally is a very broad\ncrime. So, I think what Louisiana did is they defined\nmurder to account for many ways in which it could be\ncommitted. They labeled one class of them as being --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I quite agree with that.\nMy point was just this: You made the argument -- as I\nunderstood it a moment ago -- that the Louisiana child\nrape statute is not unique; that, in fact, Louisiana\ndefines other crimes very narrowly, so that you were\nmaking a different kind of argument.\nYou were saying we in Louisiana define\nmurder of a law enforcement officer very narrowly. No\nrequirement to add any narrowing or aggravating\ncircumstance there, and the statute passed muster. And\nmy point simply is, I don't think that's the way to read\nthe Louisiana statute.\nThe Louisiana statute instead says killing\nwith intent et cetera is -- is capital murder if there\nis a further circumstance added to it; and five are\ngiven.\nSo all I'm saying is I don't think the fact\nthat your capital murder passed muster under Lowenfield\nis authority for saying that the child rape statute\npasses muster here.\nMS. CLARK: Well, I agree with you on that,\nthough I think that perhaps --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you? Do you really?\nMS. CLARK: Well, not -- I agree in the\nsense that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's find out how\nmuch.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't the -- didn't the\nLouisiana statute that -- that was at issue in\nLowenfield produce the result that if you committed\nintentional murder of a law enforcement officer, it was\nup to the jury whether to give you the death penalty or\nnot?\nMS. CLARK: Yes, correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would not the same result\nbe -- be achieved by a statute that said if you\nintentionally kill a law enforcement officer, you are\nsubject to the death penalty? Wouldn't it be precisely\nthe same degree of narrowing?\nMS. CLARK: That's correct. Yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And isn't -- isn't the\ndifference -- isn't the difference just what\nJustice Scalia brought up in an earlier question to\nMr. Fisher? He said what seems to count, the way we\nhave targeted our jurisprudence, turns on how you define\nthe class that is narrowed.\nAnd my suggestion to you was that the class\nthat is narrowed under your homicide statute is a class\nthat consist of all killing with specific intent to kill\net cetera, which is then narrowed by five different\ncircumstances set out.\nHere, the class is defined as child murder,\nand there is nothing in the aggravating circumstances,\nthe possible aggravating circumstances that narrows it\nany more; and isn't that distinction correct?\nMS. CLARK: I think, if I can address this\nperhaps without a specific yes or no, what I'm saying is\nthe homicide statute draws specifically a large class\nand specifically narrows it. The rape statute in itself\nnarrowly defines the target group without making\nreference to the broader class. I think is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In one respect is\nbroader, and perhaps whether it assists your position,\nCoker is a crime that could have only a female victim\nand a male perpetrator, but this child rape statute as I\nunderstand it could be the -- the victim could, male or\nfemale; the perpetrator could be male or female.\nMS. CLARK: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nactually, in Caddo Parish, the man who was convicted and\nsentenced to death there had a -- had a female cohort,\nso to speak who was involved in the rape with him, who I\nbelieve has not been tried yet; but she participated in\nthe rape with him, and therefore as a principal who with\nspecific intent is alleged to have committed the offense\nas well.\nSo both male and female could be convicted\nof this offense, if he commits this offense, and both\nmale and female children could be victims of this\noffense; that's correct, Your Honor.\nI think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you're looking for\ntime, let me ask you one -- one question that interests\nme but is a little divorced from the terms of the\narguments so far. I know it is not popular to refer to\nrefer to international commentary on issues like this,\nbut the English law lords have filed an amicus brief\ndiscussing the international principle that nations that\nretain the death penalty may not extend the death\npenalty to crimes to which it does not presently apply.\nThey suggest that as a matter of\ninternational law, there's sort of a correspondence to\nour evolving standards of decency that have generally\ngoverned our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. It's kind\nof a one-way rachet, we look at trends in one direction\nbut we don't look to see if you suddenly have changed\ngears and go in the other direction.\nCould you just comment on that argument?\nMS. CLARK: Well, first of all, I certainly\nrecognize that there are approximately 28 international\ncountries that would permit the death penalty for rape.\nHowever, this Court in its jurisprudence has never, ever\nbased its determination solely upon that factor. In\ncertain instances, the Court has looked to that to\nconfirm its own decision in the matter, but it's never\nbeen controlling.\nI would point out, though, Your Honor, if I\nmay, that -- that there are no -- there are no treaties\nthat are controlling upon the United States or this\nCourt that would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not asking that. I\njust used that as an analogy to our evolving standards\nof decency cases which has been part of our Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence, that sort of is a -- one way\ndirection in which these cases go. Do you think it's\nappropriate -- are you aware of any case saying we can\nturn around and go in another direction?\nMS. CLARK: I think we can, especially\nwhere, as here, that turn-around, that determination is\nbased upon a unique understanding of how this crime\nseriously, gravely affects children in a manner --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we know more about the\ncrime now than we did 40 years ago?\nMS. CLARK: Well, I think that we do. I\nthink that that is solely reflected in the child\npornography laws that have come about since then. In\nOsborne versus Ohio, the Court said, after Coker, you\ncan't even possess child pornography in the privacy of\nyour own home.\nSo I think that -- because it is so harmful.\nAnd I think that that along with Megan's Law, I think\nthat those sort of cases are also recognition of the\nfact that we now know more about this crime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you give me\none second on my own error here, but I just traced the\nstatute through. What I did was I looked at section 42.\nIt says, \"aggravated rape is a rape committed upon, et\ncetera,\" and then it says \"where the victim is under the\nage of 13.\" Right. So it doesn't say what rape is. So\nI assumed it picked up the definition of rape from\nsection 41. And section 41 defines rape as anal or oral\nor vaginal sexual intercourse, and then in section three\nit defines oral.\nNow am I right; is that the correct\nstatutory thing, or is there some other statute?\nMS. CLARK: That is the correct statutory\nthing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMS. CLARK: I was trying to make this clear\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I go back to my if\nthat is the right statutory thing, because it seems to\ncover, particularly in its definition of oral\nintercourse, a very wide range of child molesting, all\nof which I agree is quite bad, but it's still a very,\nvery wide range.\nMS. CLARK: Well, I think that all sexual\nintercourse is -- I think that's a pretty definite\noffense, despite --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say it wasn't.\nMS. CLARK: But also I would suggest that\nthe point is here is that Patrick Kennedy was not\nconvicted under that provision. He was convicted under\nthe earlier --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean, my question\nrelates back to what Justice Souter was talking about,\nabout the narrowing of the statute.\nMS. CLARK: Right. Right. I would agree\nthat some of the definition of the offenses was narrower\nunder the -- terms that Patrick Kennedy was convicted\nunder than it is today.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say about the\neffect of Enmund and Tison as a -- as a means to\nunderstand how we ought to read Coker? You know what\nI'm getting at.\nMS. CLARK: Yes, Your Honor. I believe in\nEnmund what the Court was looking at was, when the Court\naddressed the issue it didn't simply say a human life\nwasn't taken. It went on to look at is robbery itself,\nthe underlying offense, a crime serious enough to\nwarrant the death penalty? In Tison, the Court was\ntrying to address what are the limits, I believe of the\nfelony murder doctrine as applied to homicide when the\ndefendant himself -- what -- what participation in the\noffense did he have to reach that level in which he\nwould suffer the death penalty. I think that's very\ndifferent from a case like this where the offender\nabsolutely committed the offense, where the offender\nabsolutely does not act by accident or without\npremeditation or deliberation, and directly causes that\nterrible harm himself. I think the verdict --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Clark.\nMS. CLARK: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cruz?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ,\nFOR TEXAS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFew evolving standards of decency are more\npronounced that the growing understanding in modern\nsociety of the unique and irreparable harm caused by\nviolent child rape. From Jessica's Laws to Megan's Laws\nto the laws at issue here, elected legislatures have\nrepeatedly acted to deter and to punish violent child\nrape.\nIn particular, the legislatures of seven\nStates have determined that the very worst child rapists\nshould be eligible for the most serious punishment.\nI'd like to begin by talking about the\neffect of Coker. And Justice Kennedy, you raised in\nparticular the dual aspects of Coker. What we suggest\nthe effect of Coker is, is that it has been under a\ncloud of confusion. A fair reading, a careful reading\nof Coker in my judgment, it's clear Coker does not reach\nthis instance. The Court bent over backwards to\nexplicitly specify that it was adult rape, and indeed\nthe question presented in the briefing in Coker not use\nthe word adult rape at all. It was phrased generally in\nterms of rape, and the Court repeatedly and I would\nsuggest not accidently added the word adult.\nBut that being said, the States have\noperated since Coker under a great deal of confusion as\nto what exactly Coker meant. And, indeed, in 1981 the\nFlorida Supreme Court struck down their law believing\nthat it was, quote, \"compelled\" by Coker. And the State\nlegislatures when they act today -- in the State of\nTexas -- Texas is the most recent State to even act one\nof these laws. When the State legislature was\nconsidering it, the State legislature asked the Attorney\nGeneral's Office for advice specifically on whether\nCoker allowed that.\nAnd there's a great deal of confusion. As\nPetitioner argues quite passionately, those that are\nopposed to the death penalty for child rape argue\nvociferously that Coker does not allow it, as Petitioner\nhas done in many, many pages of briefing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You started out by saying\nit's the worst cases of child abuse, and that's -- child\nrape -- and that's why I was interested in the\ndefinition. It seems to me this definition simply\ncovers all instances of some kind of physical\nintercourse with a child, including oral, vaginal, anal.\nI can't imagine one that wouldn't be covered if the\nvictim of this is under the age of 13.\nNow, am I right in thinking it's not the\nworst instances; it's every instance of rape defined\nthat way?\nMR. CRUZ: You're not exactly right, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. CRUZ: The statute that is being\nchallenged in this case was the pre-amended statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the amendment --\nMR. CRUZ: So oral was not in it. And it\nwasn't 13; it was 12. So the statute under which\nPatrick Kennedy was convicted was only vaginal or anal\nrape.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was not all child rape.\nMR. CRUZ: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was not all child rape.\nIt was only children up to the age of 11.\nMR. CRUZ: That's exactly rate. And so that\nwas a substantial narrowing. It was 11 and younger, and\nit was only vaginal and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. I see.\nMR. CRUZ: And anal. Beyond that, however,\nthe juries that have considered this so far -- and it\nhas been a limited circumstance because of the\ndistorting effect of Coker -- but the juries that have\nconsidered this so far and the prosecutors that have\nprosecuted have shown every ability to distinguish truly\negregious rapes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there was some\nindication that in most cases the prosecutors, in part\nto see if they can get a plea bargain, begin by saying\nthey're going to charge with the death penalty. And I'd\nlike you to comment on prosecutorial discretion. Again,\nit cuts to weight. In one sense, it's -- it's a check,\nso that only the most egregious cases are covered.\nOn the other hand, there's a temptation to overreach,\nand it's an argument that Petitioners make for saying\nthat the death penalty should not apply.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, Petitioners\nassert that that is the case, that a plea bargain has\nbeen offered in every instance. I'm not sure of the\nsource of that assertion, but at least with respect to\nthe State of Texas, we don't have information one way or\nthe other in terms of the conduct of Louisiana\nprosecutors.\nWhat we can say is that the cases that have\nbeen prosecuted -- the two individuals currently on\ndeath row, Patrick Kennedy and Mr. Davis, committed\ncrimes that are just unspeakable. And in both of them,\nthey were not children that were close to the age; they\nwere in this case an eight-year-old little girl; in\nPatrick Kennedy's case, a five-year-old child. They\nwere crimes that were -- and that's part of the evolving\nconcept of decency. Part of the reason the States are\nacting is, in modern times, we're seeing crimes that 20,\n30, 40, years ago, people wouldn't imagine. We're\nseeing predators that seek out young children and do\nabominable things to them. And that's why legislatures\nare acting.\nI will point out Mr. Fisher speculated that\nif this Court made clear that Coker does not prevent a\nnarrow statute focused at child rapists, he speculated\nthat the States would not act.\nI'm standing here on behalf of nine States.\nThere's an additional State, Missouri, that is\nimplicated; there's the State of Louisiana. You have 11\nStates. And I say I find that speculation extremely\ndifficult to believe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Will you give us one\nsentence or two on the response to all the professionals\nwho've commented in the briefs in saying the death\npenalty here will make this situation worse?\nMR. CRUZ: Those professionals -- that is\ntheir opinion on a difficult policy question. The amici\nStates are not here advocating that -- that capital\npunishment for child rape is or isn't a terrific idea.\nWhat we are advocating is that there is an\nevolving understanding of the enormous, unique,\nirreparable harms to children, and it's elected\nlegislatures that can sit and listen to those advocates\nfrom the groups, listen to the empirical data, consider\nthe deterrence effect -- consider all of these and\ndecide one way or the other. I would fully expect, in\ntime, some States would act to establish capital\npunishment and others would not. And that that's\nprecisely how the laboratories of democracy should\noperate.\nWith respect to the decisions, the prior\ndecisions, that this Court has had in Atkins, in Roper,\nand aldo Tison and Enmund, I think all of those, as the\nChief Justice suggested, are about culpability. They\nare about saying -- Atkins and Roper both dealt with a\nclass of offenders that, for characteristics, had\nlimited culpability.\nIn this instance, Patrick Kennedy is a\n300-pound man who violently raped an eight-year-old\ngirl. On any measure, he is exquisitely culpable. And\nthe question, as this Court put it in Roper, as to the\nEighth Amendment inquiry as to the death penalty is\nwhether the offender can be reliably, quote, \"be\nclassified among the worst offenders.\"\nUnder almost any analysis, someone who\ncommits the sort of unspeakable crime that Patrick\nKennedy commits is reliably classified among the worst\noffenders.\nI would point out -- a question\nJustice Stevens asked, you know, has any nation\ninternationally gone backwards? It's interesting if you\nlook at the history in England. England actually has\ngone back in force. Blackstone actually talks about how\nrape under Saxon law was punishable by death, and then\nthere was a period 1285 where the punishment was relaxed\nto loss of the eyes and testicles. That was William the\nConqueror's kinder, gentler version.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: And Blackstone describes, quote,\n\"That previous lenity being productive of the most\nterrible consequences, it was subsequently necessary to\nreturn to making it a capital offense.\" And so England\nhad that history. It is not presently a capital offense\nin England.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But has that sort of a\ndifferent direction from evolving standards of decency\noccurred at all since we first announced the evolving\nstandards of decency and jurisprudence in this Court?\nMR. CRUZ: I'm not aware of a decision doing\nso, but the analytical predicate for the evolving\nstandards of decency -- this Court said over and over\nagain the most reliable indicium is the objective\njudgment of elected legislatures. And in this instance,\nthe legislatures --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what about the comment\non the international community's view that it is really\na one way rachet?\nMR.CRUZ: You know, the Law Lords' brief --\nI have to admit personally I found really quite\nastonishing, and I was harkened back to some of the\nissues this Court considered in the Medeillin case\nbecause the Law Lords' brief argued that the United\nStates -- that this Court has no ability to determine\nthat any other crime is subject to the death penalty.\nAnd there were two bases: One was a treaty that the\nUnited States has never ratified. And secondly was this\ninchoate international law understanding that, because\nother nations have made a policy determination about the\ndeath penalty, that it is forbidden to the U.S.\nCongress, it is forbidden to the States of the United\nStates, and it is forbidden to this Court to ever\nacknowledge there is a crime that is consistent with our\nConstitution.\nThat brief, to my mind, embodied all of the\ndangers of the very broad arguments that we're being\npresented in Medeillin, that ultimately the\nConstitutional and the people of this country determine\nwhat is permissible and what is lawful. This Court has\nchosen to look to other nations for guidance, but that\nbrief didn't say this is guidance. That brief said the\nUnited States is foreclosed from ever doing this because\nother nations have made determinations under their law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were asked to draft\nthis statute that we have here and you have just the\ndefinition of the first statute with the -- what we call\naggravated kind of -- and you have the age limit,\nwould any other limiting categories occur to you as\nbeing inconsistent with sound statutory drafting and\nsound policy?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, there are three\npossible narrowing factors that occur to me. We would\nsubmit the statute is sufficiently narrow as drafted,\nbut beyond that, the one that has been -- the four\nStates that have most recently acted have used\nrecidivism as a narrowing factor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's prior\nconviction --\nMR. CRUZ: Prior conviction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not prior offenses?\nMR. CRUZ: Correct. There are two other\nnarrowing -- narrowing aggravators that could be\napplied. One would be especially heinous or vile rapes.\nThe aggravated rape that Justice Powell discussed in his\nCoker opinion, a really brutal case, which both Florida\nand Georgia have -- I would note Petitioner says Patrick\nKennedy could not be convicted in any other State. In\nFlorida and Georgia, if they concluded that his violent\nrape requiring surgery to correct was especially violent\nand heinous, he could be convicted in either of those\nStates. Or, finally, there could be, as in Lowenfield,\nan aggravator for multiple victims. Some of the worst\nof these child rapists rape more than one child. And so\nthat is another potential aggravator that a State could\nchoose.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Fisher, we'll give you five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: I would like to address first\nthe narrowing component of this case and then turn to\nthe idea of trends on the first question presented.\nFirst, the reasons for this Court's\nnarrowing jurisprudence is to avoid a situation in which\na few, only a few offenders out of a vast pool are given\nthe death penalty, and there's no legal principled\nexplanation to describe why those offenders get the\ndeath penalty.\nMs. Clark says that Louisiana's law is\nnarrow. Well, if you just look at empiric, as best as\nwe've been able to gather statistics and Texas has some\nsimilar statistics in its brief, we're talking about\nunder Louisiana's definition of child rape about five\ntimes as many individuals per year as are convicted of\ndeliberate murder. This is enormous class. And what\nyou end up with is only one every several years getting\nthe death penalty. That is the definition of arbitrary\nand capriciousness.\nJustice Breyer, Mr. Cruz is right, Louisiana\nSupreme Court at 58(a) addressed -- addressed -- as\nexisted at trial, it included or rape. I'm not sure\nexactly under ex post facto which is the operative one\nor not, but it doesn't matter because even the anal or\nvaginal component statute still gets you five times as\nmany -- than just absolutely being struck by lightning.\nEven in Louisiana simply consensual sex between an\n18-year-old and a 12-year-old is a capital offense.\nAnd so we don't think Louisiana's law\nsufficiently narrows. Mr. Cruz says --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that in front of us\nhere?\nMR. FISHER: It is with respect to\nnarrowing, because Mr. Cruz -- the only answer to that,\nI think is what Mr. Cruz --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is not a speech case\nwhere you have standing to object to the statute that\ncan -- would be unconstitutional as applied to others --\nMR. FISHER: We absolutely do --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or is -- contradicts.\nMR. FISHER: There's square precedent,\nunanimous holding of this Court in Maynard against\nCartwright so that you can't justify a statute that\nfails to narrow on as applied grounds. The\nconstitutional infirmity is the fact that it gives\nunfettered discretion to prosecutors and juries to\nchoose who to give the death sentence to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand the\ndifference. If you have a general murder law with an\naggravating factor of killing of a law officer, okay,\nthe jury can decide from the whole category of killings\nof law officers who gets the death penalty and who\ndoesn't. Why is that any different from what happens\nwhen you have a statute that makes it a capital offense\nto kill a law officer, without any further\nqualification?\nIt's exactly the same result. It goes to\nthe jury. This person killed a law officer. It is up\nto you whether you give him the death penalty or not.\nMR. FISHER: At the end of the day the jury\nhas discretion. But the difference between that case\nand this case is that you have a much smaller pool of\noffenders and a much higher likelihood the jury is going\nto return death. Here you have have a vast pool and\nliterally persons one out of every several years getting\nthe death penalty.\nIf I could say a thing -- two things about\nthe trend argument that the states have putting forward?\nFirst, remember there's no trend whatsoever\nwith respect to non-recidivists. The other states that\nhave passed laws in child rape context for capital --\nmaking it a capital crime and even in the Meagan law and\nothers is all about recidivism.\nLouisiana is not part of that trend.\nLouisiana stands alone.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- the\nbulk of your argument, though, it seems to me, would\nnot -- would be the same in a recidivist case, because,\nof course, that doesn't result in death either.\nMR. FISHER: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, I don't --\nit is sort of a factual distinction but I don't see how\nit helps your argument.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it would give you a\nnarrower way to do this case. You could say that under\nthe analysis -- Roper actions Louisiana stands alone in\nterms of what is national consensus.\nIn Enmund this Court said that it is not\nenough for other states to make the basic crime a\ncapital offense. We look to see whether if the other\nstates require an aggravating circumstance, that the\nState before the Court does not; an aggravating\ncircumstance that makes the offender more culpable or\nthe crime more serious. We exclude those states from\nour bean counting analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure that\nthe sort of trends that they look to in Roper and\nAtkins -- I mean, you had different crimes that carried\nthe capital punishment as well. I don't think we're\nlooking at trends in that regard.\nMR. FISHER: If we're looking at trends,\nperhaps I can leave you with this: Again, remember what\nwe have in terms of a trend. All we have done in the\npast 30 years is returned to the place that we were 30\nyears ago in Coker. In Coker when you read that\nopinion, six states make child rape a capital offense.\nThrough all the might and effort of proponents of these\nlaws, what they've been able to accomplish over 31 years\nis to bring it back exactly where we were in Coker this.\nThis Court's whole Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence is based on the idea that a few states may\nwell have laws making something a capital crime and may\nchoose to be outliers, but the very notion of this\nCourt's proportionality jurisprudence is that when\nstates are outliers, and especially in a case like this,\nwhen even are those outlier states impose the death\npenalty so rarely and freakishly, that is a situation\nwhere the Eighth Amendment does not tolerate it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\n"
