        "content": "[10:07 a.m.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nGranholm against Heald and two related cases.\nMr. Bolick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CLINT BOLICK\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1274\nMR. BOLICK: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFor 124 years, as state power over alcohol has\nebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtually\nconstant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of\nrules, not by two. New York and Michigan consigned out\nof-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three\ntier system for closing the market to thousands of small\nfamily-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of\na liquor distributor oligopoly.\nDiscrimination is the core concern of the\nCommerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the\nstate is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in\neconomic protectionism. The states and the liquor\ndistributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has\nconsistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment\ncreates plenary state authority.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under your view, could\nthe three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New\nJersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New\nYork wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?\nMR. BOLICK: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, under your view, the whole\nthree-tier system has to go down?\nMR. BOLICK: No, Justice Kennedy. So long as\nthe state does not discriminate against out-of-state\nentities, it is free to, as this Court -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under my hypothetical.\nI don't know exactly how -- the way it works, you have to\nbe a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer.\nUnder your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a\nNew York retailer.\nMR. BOLICK: That is -- or a challenge, as you\nask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to\nthat, under the same theory that we're advocating here.\nThe state may have a different set of defenses that it\ndoesn't have here. But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But so far as -- the rationale\nis the same.\nMR. BOLICK: The -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, under\nyour rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to\nfall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.\nMR. BOLICK: It has to pass constitutional\nmuster.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And when you say there is no\nprecedent -- I mean, I think a much more modest claim than\nyou're making, the claim simply that a state cannot\ndiscriminate against out-of-state liquor -- i.e., the\nphysical liquid -- which is really more modest and keeps\nthe three-tier effect -- now, your -- that claim, that\nthey couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in\nYoung's Market. I read the briefs in that case. The\nbriefs presented that Court -- you could have written\nthose briefs. And the difficulty for you is, it\narticulated that more modest version very clearly, made a\ntremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by\nSection 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. And this Court\nsquarely rejected it.\nMR. BOLICK: Your Honor, Young's Market -- the\nresult in Young's Market was correct -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The result, I understand, you\ncould put on the basis of there being no discrimination.\nMR. BOLICK: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Reading Justice Brandeis'\nopinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his\nresult.\nMR. BOLICK: The -- the cases that followed\nYoung's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a\nvery sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment. The\nCourt began trenching on that very broad view immediately\nin 1939.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why wasn't that broad\nview appropriate, given the difference between the\nlanguage of the Wilson Act, which has had the words \"to\nthe same extent and in the same manner,\" and the Webb\nKenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty\nFirst Amendment, leaves out \"to the same extent and the\nsame manner.\" It just says that \"alcoholic beverage so\nthat the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use\ntherein, in violation of laws thereof.\" It doesn't say\n\"nondiscriminatory laws.\"\nMR. BOLICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the -- there\nwas no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language\nof the Wilson Act. The Wilson Act dealt with the question\nof discrimination. The Webb-Kenyon Act dealt with\nquestions that arose subsequent to the enactment of the\nWilson Act. And as this Court has held in Craig versus -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe that's the Act,\nbut when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they\nadopt the language, \"to the same extent and in the same\nmanner\"?\nMR. BOLICK: I think the reason for that is\nbecause it was so obvious that the state could not, prior\nto prohibition, discriminate. It was not only embodied in\nthe Wilson Act, but it was embodied in at least three\ncases of this Court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it was not obvious to the\nperson who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first\ninstance, because as I -- as I understand it, there was an\nanti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped.\nAnd do we know why it was dropped?\nMR. BOLICK: It was dropped essentially because\nit was redundant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but is that a -- is that\non a legislative history record somewhere? Do we know\nthat?\nMR. BOLICK: No, Justice Souter, that is not\nexpressly on the record. What is on the record, however,\nis that the Court was aiming -- or, excuse me, the\nCongress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions.\nThere -- and it -- and the one case that was clearest on\npoint on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying\nboth the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid\ndiscrimination. And there was -- there is nothing in the\nlegislative history to indicate that Congress intended to\noverturn that decision. And as this Court has held in\nCraig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty\nFirst Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate\nboth the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore\nto the states the police power that they had before\nprohibition. Emphatically, discrimination was not a part\nof that police power. It was a very accepted context.\nSo, too, is it today. When the -- when the\nliquor distributors in the states asked this Court to\noverturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view\nof the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you\nto overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to\noverturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980,\nthe more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held\nthat the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the\nTwenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the\nCommerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated.\nAnd when you look at the core values of the two\nclauses, they do not clash. The core purpose of the\nCommerce Clause is nondiscrimination. The core purpose of\nthe Twenty-First Amendment is temperance. And if you have\na discriminatory statute, it sends a very strong signal\nthat, in fact -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not only\ntemperance, but it's control over revenues.\nCan you tell me, is the -- is there a New York\nState excise tax on alcohol?\nMR. BOLICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it collected by the\nwholesaler?\nMR. BOLICK: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. What is it, ten\ndollars a gallon, or what?\nMR. BOLICK: It's -- it turns out to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it on one -\nMR. BOLICK: -- a few cents a bottle, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It is on one -\nMR. BOLICK: It's on -- it's -- and all alcohol.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under our cases, can the\nCalifornia winery be required to remit the tax to the New\nYork State revenue authorities?\nMR. BOLICK: We believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that consistent with Quill?\nMR. BOLICK: It is consistent with Quill. The\nway that the states -- there are 26 states that allow\ndirect interstate shipment of wine, and the FTC has\nexamined their record to see if they are doing okay. And\none of the things that they do -- are able to do is tax\ncollection. New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Nevada do\ncollect taxes. The way they do it is by requiring a\npermit in order to ship wine into the state. That takes\ncare of a number of problems, including all sorts of\naccountability concerns that the state may raise.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -\nMR. BOLICK: Under -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the\nargument that there's no practical way, except at great\nexpense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?\nMR. BOLICK: Justice Souter, this is one of the\nmost regulated industries in America, of course, and the\nmodel legislation that has been adopted by a number of\nstates includes record-keeping provisions, it requires\nthat wineries -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I will grant that's\nrequired, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to\nfind out whether they're doing what they are required to\ndo, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit.\nAnd that's one thing in the state; it's another thing\nacross the country.\nMR. BOLICK: No, it's important to recognize,\nJustice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is\n-- which is where the states of New York and Michigan are\nsaying that the other state wineries have to go -- the\nthree-tier system does not do that. The states already\nrely on the Federal Government and the other states to\npolice the wineries.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're -\nMR. BOLICK: Should they -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying they are not dropping\nin to local wineries to do audits, in fact?\nMR. BOLICK: They may, in some instances. It is\nprimarily a federal -- a federal activity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do we have in the record\non that?\nMR. BOLICK: There is not -- there is not a\ngreat deal on the record, either way, on that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean by\n\"it's primarily a federal activity,\" that the Federal\nGovernment polices compliance with the state tax laws?\nMR. BOLICK: That's correct, Your Honor. Under\nthe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does that occur?\nMR. BOLICK: -- under the Federal Alcohol\nAdministration Act, any violation of a state law is a\nfederal offense and it is a violation -- so basically,\nwhether it's under-age access, whether it's taxation,\nwhatever -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But does the federal authority\nmake a routine audit to see that the state tax has been\npaid?\nMR. BOLICK: Basically, every single time that\nthere is a transaction, it is recorded by the U.S. Trade\nand Tax Bureau.\nAnd if it may please the Court, I'd like to\nreserve the rest of my time -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. BOLICK: -- for rebuttal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I have just one further\nquestion. Justice Kennedy asked you, \"What about the\nwholesaler? What about the retailer?\" What about\nalcoholic beverages other than wine?\nMR. BOLICK: Justice Ginsburg, very important\nquestion. We are here today because a majority of states\nhave chosen to regulate wine distinctively. And a handful\nof them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to\ndo so in a discriminatory manner. So long as states do\nnot discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard\nto other alcohol -- and they don't; there's a flat\nprohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and\nother types of spirits -- we will not be here, because\nthere would be no discrimination; there would be a single\nrule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Sullivan?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 03-1116 AND 03-1120\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nNothing in today's case, Justice Kennedy,\nrequires you to take on the three-tier system, for the\nissue that is presented here is a very narrow one.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's very narrow, but\nthe rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked. I just\ndon't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the\ncornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can\nsurvive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical\nwhere a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the -- you know,\nthe physical facilities and so forth that the New York\nwholesaler does.\nMS. SULLIVAN: All that we ask in this case,\nJustice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New\nYork's decision to apply the three-tier system to everyone\nexcept their own in-state -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I know, but what -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- producers of wine -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but you're -- all you're\nasking is for a rationale that's sweeping.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, in our case, we\nwant to suggest that it is -- just as in Healy and Bacchus\n-- that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state\nproducers and against out-of-state producers loses its\nimmunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. As\nJustice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor\nlaw's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity\nafforded by the Twenty-First Amendment.\nIt's really the state's position, aided by their\nwholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one. Their\nposition is that every state law that regulates the\nimportation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any\nconceivable rational connection to a state purpose. So,\nfor example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all\nCalifornia wines, facially exclude California wines,\nsaying, \"There are too many of them, it interferes with\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your answer to Justice\nKennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took\naway the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get,\nthen out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but\nthey'd have nothing to complain about.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's exactly correct, Justice\nGinsburg. As you've said in the context of gender\ndiscrimination, you can cure an equal-protection problem\nby leveling up or leveling down. In this case, we would\nsuggest that the principle of free trade that was the\nreason, the principal reason, for the framing of the\nConstitution and has been reflected in over a century of\ndormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, suggests that you\nshould -- the remedy should be to open the markets to out\nof-state producers -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a decision for the\nstate to make. I mean, the -- what -\nMS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not for this Court.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't deny that a state -\nthat Michigan could bar all out-of-state wine -- not just\n-- not just California, but they could bar all out-of-\nstate wines?\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice Stevens,\nif it were in aid, and only if it were in aid, of the\nstates -- and necessary to serve the state's internal\npurposes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The only reason being given to\ngive a monopoly to local producers, that's their -\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- whole purpose. But could\nthey do that?\nMS. SULLIVAN: The state can have a monopoly if\nit's, itself, a market participant. What the state may -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm saying just to look at\nthe -- just limit to the market to -- the only market\nparticipants would be Michigan wine -\nMS. SULLIVAN: Private -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- wineries.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, a state may not\ndiscriminate against out-of-staters for the sole purpose\nof economic protectionism.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm trying to think of\nwhat Brandeis could have been thinking.\nMS. SULLIVAN: In Young's Market.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right. And this is\na reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no\ndoubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the\ndormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of\noriginal package doctrine -\nMS. SULLIVAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which meant that the foreign\nliquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor.\nNow, he's thinking, \"Why is that? What is that package\ndoctrine?\" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause\n-- it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause -- the dormant\nCommerce Clause is the implication from the existence of\nthe commerce power in the Constitution. So if we have an\namendment that says \"that aspect of the dormant Commerce\nClause doesn't apply,\" that means the dormant Commerce\nClause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant\nCommerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.\nMS. SULLIVAN: But Justice -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, maybe -- I think that's\nhow he's reasoning.\nMS. SULLIVAN: But -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if he is, and even if he\nisn't, why isn't that right?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, the Young's\nMarket language permitting state discrimination is,\nindeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of\nthis Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First\nAmendment with the rest of the Constitution. Remember,\nJustice Brandeis, in Young's Market, didn't even think the\nEqual Protection Clause applied to liquor imports, a\nposition that's inconsistent with Craig against Boren.\nAnd nobody would suggest today that equal protection\npermits a state to import only from male-owned wineries or\nonly import wine from white-owned wineries.\nSo there -- the 40 years of jurisprudence -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Craig against Boren was -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- has been -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- had nothing to do with the\nCommerce Clause.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor, but if -- if\nthere were a law -- the states are claiming that any law\ngoverning -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Nothing to do with\nimportation, either.\nMS. SULLIVAN: But the dormant Commerce Clause\nreflects a fundamental structural principle that is every\nbit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal\nProtection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren. Indeed this\nCourt, in cases from McCulloch to the Eleventh Amendment\ncases and state sovereignty cases, has recognized that a\nprinciple of the Constitution is no less fundamental\nbecause it is a structural implication of the text. So\nthe dormant Commerce Clause stands on the same footing as\nthe affirmative power of Congress and on -- it's the same\nfooting as the Equal Protection Clause at issue -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think Congress -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- in Craig v. Boren -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- could enact a statute\nauthorizing the states to do just what they've done here?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Absolutely, but it has not. And\nthe Wilson Act -- to go back to Justice Souter's question\nand Justice Ginsburg's question -- Congress could\nauthorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran\nFerguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against\nout-of-state industry with respect to the industry of\ninsurance. It has not done so here. Webb-Kenyon did not\nauthorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade\ndiscrimination for just -- reasons Justice Ginsburg\ndescribed. It said you may regulate imports of liquor in\nthe same manner as local liquor laws. And, of course, the\npurpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to\nkeep dry by preventing all those original packages from\npiling up in the railway stations and being open to\nbootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry\npolicies of the state. Wilson forbade discrimination.\nWeb Kenyan didn't authorize it.\nAnd in Congress' most recent articulation of its\nview of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and\nthe rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment\nEnforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress\nhas a rules-of-construction section that says, \"We view\nany state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws\nas reflecting the jurisprudence of this court.\" And, in\nfact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section\nreflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases\nthat said dormant commerce -- the negative implications of\nthe Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection\nClause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment\nClause, constrain the states in their regulation of\nimportation of liquor.\nSo with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice\nBreyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination\nhave been superceded.\nWhat New York and Michigan have done here is say\nthat one set of exceptions apply only to in-state\nproducers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, \"If you\njust sell beer within our state, you don't have to face\nprice ceilings that you have to face if you do business\nover in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.\" Just as in\nBacchus, the -- you struck down a decision -- an excise\ntax exemption that said, \"If you're an importer of liquor,\nyou have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local\nproducer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out\nof that restriction.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, we've got one difference\nfrom Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here,\nwhich I gather was not made, or made seriously, in\nBacchus, is there really is a need for differential\ntreatment for purposes of enforcement. Go back to the\nenforcement of the tax law.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How are we supposed -- what\nstandard are we supposed to use to judge that argument?\nAnd, by that standard, how good is the argument?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Souter, we believe the\nstandard should be strict scrutiny, though there must be a\nnecessity to serve -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- a legitimate -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it's facial discrimination.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Because it's facial\ndiscrimination. It's absolutely undisputed. Michigan -\nin fact, Michigan state concedes that they have flatly\nbanned out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to\nconsumers. There's no question that this is facially\ndiscriminatory. But even if the standard were a more\ndeferential one in which all the state needed to show was\na reasonable need for discrimination, it can't come close\nto doing that here. Neither Michigan nor New York has\nshown that the facial discrimination here is necessary to\nprotect minors or to protect the collection of taxes.\nLet's start with minors. The Michigan claim\nthat it's protecting against under-18 sales is belied by\nthe fact that Michigan is allowing 40 Michigan wineries\nand, at last count, 7500 Michigan retailers to deliver\ndirectly to consumers. The way to protect my -- so just\nas in Craig v. Boren, the exception for young women to\ndrink 3.2 beer, as opposed to young men, belied the\nstate's interest in temperance. So the pattern of\nexceptions here that Michigan has created belies any\nnotion that it's protecting under-18-year-olds from\ndrinking. And, of course -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what about audits for\nrevenue -\nMS. SULLIVAN: On revenue, the nondiscriminatory\nmeans that's available to the state that Michigan and New\nYork have not shown any reason to reject -- 26 states have\nadopted some version of this -- is to require an out-of-\nstate winery to get a permit. And that's a -- Justice\nBreyer, one thing that's still left of Brandeis. You can\nrequire a permit from an out-of-state winery, which would\nbe unusual to acquire from widgets or milk. But you can\nrequire a permit, and, as a condition of the permit,\nJustice Souter. The out-of-state winery has to agree to\nsubmit to the state's jurisdiction, to submit to the\nstate's tax jurisdiction.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, whether or not Quill would\npermit taxation if you were simply sending by common\ncarrier, our clients want to -- want to pay taxes, want to\nsign up for permits, want to play on a -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- level playing field -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- well, they do today, I'm\nsure, but -\n[Laughter.]\nMS. SULLIVAN: But, Justice Souter, to -- look\nat the experience -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They -- you say they don't want\nto go to California to do an audit.\nMS. SULLIVAN: They certainly don't, Justice\nSouter, but New Hampshire is a state that has actually -\nyour own state is a state that has on its Web site a set\nof out-of-state wineries. It requires that they keep and\nsupply sales records on a monthly basis, that they keep\nthose records for three years -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe we're getting ripped off.\nMS. SULLIVAN: I -\n[Laughter.]\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- think New Hampshire's done\nvery well collecting taxes from out-of-state producers,\nJustice Souter. It's a leader -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Sullivan -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- in the field.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- may I -- may I -- I just\nwant to clarify one point. It was just -- the question\nJustice Stevens asked. It's your position that if\nMichigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed\nand consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to\nbe sold, possessed, and consumed. Would -\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is your -\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.\nBut to go back to the physical-presence\nquestion, Justice Souter, Michigan is not now -- Michigan\nofficials are not now traipsing up to the upper peninsula\nand all around the state to inspect wineries. The record\nis clear on that. What Michigan does is require that\nwineries in Michigan send samples and records to their\noffices. And the Internet actually, if anything -- the\nstates say that the Internet increases the danger, but the\nInternet also increases, in parallel, the power of the\nstates to police out-of-state wineries without an in-state\npresence. Just as, Justice Stevens, the Internet may make\nevery speaker with a PC a town crier, as you said -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- in Reno versus ACLU --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- could a state -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- so it makes every interstate\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- could a state require an\nout-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a\npassword, so that, with a password, they could go in and\naudit the books across the country, by wire?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Souter, if it were\npart of a -- an agreement to a permit that the -- that the\nout-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no\nextraterritorial regulation there, that would be just\nfine. So, yes, the state can, through Internet, so to\nspeak, -- Internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring\n-- do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the\nout-of-state winery is paying taxes.\nAnd, by the way, Michigan does not collect\ntaxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors.\nMichigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're\nin-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers.\nSo Michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state\nwineries have to go through the distributors for tax\npurposes. They're not using the distributors as their\ntax-collection agents now.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Commerce Clause, in effect,\nprotects consumers in states from entrenched business\ninterests that want to have protectionism, and you're -\nyou object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do\nit. Under that rationale, aren't all the California\nreciprocity laws invalid, as well?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, reciprocity laws\n-- yet -- possibly. They may be a necessary requirement\nnow that so many states are closed to states. They may be\na necessary mechanism for some states trying to get wines\nto market in the way that the framers envisaged. It may\nbe a necessary, for now, to get into closed states. In a\nworld that we hope that you create, in which\ndiscrimination is not allowed, they would be completely\nunnecessary and possibly unconstitutional.\nBut to return to the key point here, Michigan\nand New York may not facially discriminate in favor of\ntheir own producers unless they can show that reasonable\nnondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable. And here,\nJustice Souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny,\nthey have not come close to making that kind of showing,\nbecause there are all these other means -- means that have\nbeen recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate,\nmeans that have been proven in states from New Hampshire\nto Virginia, means that are not based on facial\ndiscrimination. It's the discrimination that has to be\nshown to -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- be necessary here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- be sure I heard your answer\nto Justice Kennedy correctly. You'd concede that the\nreciprocity laws are all unconstitutional?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Not -- they are subject to\nheightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out\nof-staters in a way that you could not -- for example, in\nNew Energy, you said that you can't have a preference for\n-- you can't have a discrimination in Ohio in reciprocity\nfor Indiana. Reciprocity laws normally do violate the\nprinciple of dormant Commerce Clause invalidation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you contend that they do\n-- the liquor reciprocity laws, all of them are\nunconstitutional.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Not -- we contend that they would\nbe subject to strict scrutiny, and they could be upheld if\nthe state could show that they are closely tailored in a\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They can -- that they can be\n--\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- way that these laws are not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- upheld by making a showing\nthat you say is virtually impossible to make.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, that's not before,\nand if there were other reasons -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I think it is -\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- the state could -\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- it is an interesting\nquestion as to whether that's a -- that's a -- you know,\nthat's a necessary consequence of this decision, in your\nview.\nyou to reach the question of whether there are other state\ndefenses in other cases. The justifications the states\nhave given here are so terribly weak in relation to their\ndiscriminatory laws that you should strike down these\nlaws, you should invalidate them, you should affirm the\njudgement of the Sixth Circuit and reverse the judgements\nof the Second Circuit.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Sullivan.\nMr. Casey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1116 and 03-1120\nMr. Casey: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFor more than 70 years, the Twenty-First\nAmendment has permitted states to restrict the importation\nand delivery of alcohol by out-of-state vendors. There\nare substantial differences between licensed in-state\nvendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not\nsubject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing\npowers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires\nthat sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be\nperformed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state\nvendors. This importation regulation is a power expressly\nconferred by the text of the Twenty-First Amendment. It's\nconsistent with the entire history of alcohol regulation\nin this country, and it's consistent with this Court's\njurisprudence interpreting the Twenty-First Amendment -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now the Bacchus case cuts\nagainst you, to some extent.\nMR. CASEY: The Bacchus case was a very unique\nsituation that we believe is not in any way controlling in\nthe present case. It was not an importation case; it was\nan exemption from a state excise tax on wholesalers for\nalcohol that was already within the state's stream of\ncommerce.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I think what's\nfairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to\nlook at the language of Bacchus, and the language of\nBacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination\ncomponent of the Commerce Clause to liquor control. I\nthink that's a fair and necessary reading of the case.\nNow -\nMR. CASEY: I disagree that that is a necessary\nreading -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I know it -\nMR. CASEY: -- of the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- involved pineapple wine and\nall that. I know that, but -\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what we're talking about is\nthe language of the Court in that case.\nMR. CASEY: Correct, but you're -- you have to\nunderstand that language in light of the actual context.\nThere, the state did not even assert a Twenty-First\nAmendment defense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you have to\nunderstand Young in the light of its context, where there\nwas no discrimination -\nMR. CASEY: There was discrimination in Young,\nYour Honor, and I'd like to get to that. But to focus on\nBacchus for a moment, the state never asserted the Twenty\nFirst amendment, and it was undisputed -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the question was\nbefore the Court, because the dissent certainly raised the\nquestion.\nMR. CASEY: Correct. And we have suggested, in\nour brief, that the Bacchus case is distinguishable and\nnot controlling here. We have also suggested that Bacchus\nwas incorrectly decided. We can prevail in this case\nwithout overruling Bacchus, but we have suggested that -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, why don't you focus on\nthat? Because it's a little hard to plan on overruling\nthat case.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CASEY: Well -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why don't you at least\naddress how you would distinguish Bacchus? Because there\nis a lot of language in there that cuts against your\nposition.\nMR. CASEY: The only justification for the\nstatute in Bacchus was what the Court characterized as\n\"mere protectionism.\" That's not the situation with the\nMichigan statute. Again, the Michigan statute involves\nthe paradigm -- or the quintessential Twenty-First\nAmendment power of regulating importation; it's not an -\nattacks on alcohol that's already an exemption from a tax\nfor two particular products.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no -- I mean, that --\nMR. CASEY: Do you -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that rather lengthy\nstatement you made earlier, that the Bacchus case didn't\ninvolve the importation of alcohol. But it did. I mean,\nthe only reason that the in-state exemption was held to be\nunconstitutional was because you were treating out-of-\nstate sellers differently. How can you possibly say that\n--\nMR. CASEY: It was treating -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the case didn't involve it?\nMR. CASEY: -- it was treating two particular\nitems of in-state production differently than all other\nin-state items and out-of-state items; but it was a\ntaxation issue, not an importation issue. And as the\nCourt said in Bacchus and in Capital Cities, the correct\nanalysis in the -- in evaluating this kind of case is to\ndetermine, first, whether the activity of the regulation\nat issue is an exercise of a power conferred by the\nTwenty-First Amendment -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't we focus on\nthe Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by\nJustice White. He said, \"Hawaii's discriminatory tax\ncannot stand.\" And then he said, \"Whatever you can say\nabout the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain,\nthe central purpose was not to empower the states to favor\nlocal liquor industries by erecting barriers to\ncompetition.\" That was this Court's explanation for\nruling the way it did, even though there was this infant\nindustry of pineapple whatever.\nMR. CASEY: That was the first stage of the\nCourt's analysis. The Court went on to say it was not\nsupported by any clear concern of the Twenty-First\nAmendment in combating the evils of an unrestricted\ntraffic in liquor -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your opponents have said\nthat there isn't any clear countervailing interest here.\nThey're saying you can't claim you're protecting kids,\nbecause you're selling to the kids at home; there's no\nserious audit-collection problem; and the other regulatory\ninterests -- they didn't say this, but are, sort of, gauzy\nthe way they're stated. I mean, they're saying that, by a\nprocess of elimination, what you get down to is nothing\nbut discrimination and protectionism. What is -- what is\nyour answer to that? Where is -\nMR. CASEY: We -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the substantial interest?\nMR. CASEY: -- we disagree wholeheartedly with\nthat. The Michigan -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but -\nMR. CASEY: -- the Michigan regulations do\npromote the state's interest in temperance. They do give\nthe state a better -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- I mean, you say\nthat, but how? The very activity that you don't want them\nto engage in, you're engaging in, or your local wineries\nare engaging in, for example.\nMR. CASEY: But the key is, with an in-state\nlicensee, the state has the ability to enforce against\nthat licensee, to inspect, to punish the licensee -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do we -\nMR. CASEY: -- to hold them accountable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do we have a record of what\nthe state is doing with respect to its in-state licensees,\nindicating what it could not do effectively to out-of-\nstaters? What do we have in the record?\nMR. CASEY: The record in this case consisted of\na small number of affidavits, answers to interrogatories,\nsome surveys that were submitted as exhibits to motions\nfor summary judgement. Both sides submitted that type of\nevidence. The District Court decided this was a question\nof law, and specifically said that he did not consider any\nof the factual evidence. So the record -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, should -\nMR. CASEY: -- was not fully developed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- should we send it back for\n-- if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the\nother of these cases go back for evidence on what, in\nfact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state\nlicensees and evidence that it could not effectively do\nthe same with respect to out-of-staters?\nMR. CASEY: Yes, if -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And what would you show? What\ndo you, in effect -- make an offer of proof.\nMR. CASEY: We would show that the Michigan\nrequirement limiting sales and direct shipping to in-state\nlicensees is required because the state only has effective\nenforcement authority over in-state licensees. But -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but wait a minute. You\n-- it was suggested that the state could require a license\nof an out-of-state supplier, and that that license could\nbe conditioned upon submission to Michigan's jurisdiction\nin all respects. Is that not feasible?\nMR. CASEY: Michigan does have a current license\nfor out-state seller of wine. You know, these players -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But could you not require\nsubmission to -\nMR. CASEY: We -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Michigan's jurisdiction\nfor all purposes of enforcement?\nMR. CASEY: Certainly, we could pass a law to\nthat effect. The problem is -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if you -- if you did that,\ncould you require, as I suggested of Counsel on the other\nside, that you -- that, as a condition of the licensing,\nthat the business records of these companies be placed in\nsome secure online fashion, that, with a password, you\ncould get into and do an audit across the continent just\nas readily as you could do an audit next door? Could\nMichigan not do that?\nMR. CASEY: But there is no guarantee that such\nan audit would be just the same as an audit of an in-state\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask, once we\naccept the proposition -- I think this is the necessary\nreading of Bacchus -- that the Commerce Clause applies to\nliquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's\njust like any other commodity -- food, milk, et cetera -\nand, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to\nshow that this discriminatory treatment is justified -\nmaybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny. And\nthis trial has occurred. You have had that opportunity.\nI don't see why you have a right to go back.\nMR. CASEY: Despite the lack of evidence in the\nrecord and the fact that District Court did not consider\nthat evidence, the Sixth Circuit dismissed all of those\nclaims of the state and remanded for entry of judgement on\nthe Plaintiffs without giving us an opportunity to develop\nthat record. I also want to say -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: See, I don't -- I don't\nunderstand. Didn't you have an opportunity to develop the\nrecord? I mean, this was -\nMR. CASEY: There was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a discriminatory matter. It\nwas your burden to show that whatever discrimination\nexisted -- assuming that we find the law the way Bacchus\nseemed to say it is -- it was your burden to show that\nthere was some justification for that discrimination.\nMR. CASEY: There -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You had your chance to show it.\nMR. CASEY: -- there was evidence in the record.\nThere were affidavits from Michigan enforcement officials\nabout stings, about problem with enforcing -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right, well -\nMR. CASEY: -- against Internet -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- tell us what those -- what\nthat material is, and if we find that material sustains\nyour burden, that's fine, you win; and if it doesn't, you\nlose. I don't know why we have to let you go back and -\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and retry the case.\nMR. CASEY: Our key position is that before you\nget to that kind of evidentiary burden, the legal question\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm interested in.\nYou win, either way. If it -- maybe if the Commerce\nClause -- dormant Commerce Clause discrimination principle\napplies, you win, if we scrutinize strictly and say you\nhave a good justification. Whether you do or not, I guess\nI'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more\ninterested in the first half, which is -- doesn't apply at\nall.\nNow, your opponent said, in response to my\npointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to\nprecedent, Bacchus. Young's Market isn't any good\nanymore. As to concept, you can divide the dormant\nCommerce Clause into a -- you have to favor out-of-state\nprinciple, which was the original package doctrine, which\nhas long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination\nprinciple, which hasn't disappeared. And her third part,\nimplicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed\nat the original package part; there is not a word in any\nbrief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get\nrid of the anti-discrimination principle. I haven't found\na word in support on your side on that. So she says, \"Put\nthose three things together, and we win.\" That's her\npoint. Now, what's your response?\nMR. CASEY: We disagree with that entire\nposition. The text -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you do.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CASEY: -- the text of the Twenty-First\nAmendment -- the text of the Twenty-First Amendment gives\nstates the right to control imports. The history of the\nTwenty-First Amendment in the Webb-Kenyon Act clearly\ndemonstrate -- the purpose of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to\neliminate alcohol shipments from -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think -\nMR. CASEY: -- the Commerce Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that Michigan can prohibit\nthe importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine\nto be produced, sold, and consumed?\nMR. CASEY: Yes. That's precisely what\nsituation was with -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you do, but the\nprinciple of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the\nWilson Act was already there -- very clear -- is to stop\nthe original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out\nof-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you\nhad to sell less. I mean, that's what it's there for. I\ndidn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've\njust said; and if there are such words, now is the time to\npoint them to me -- to point them out.\nMR. CASEY: The title of the Webb-Kenyon Act is,\n\"It is in -- an act divesting intoxicating liquors of\ntheir interstate character in certain cases. The clear\nintent of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to remove alcohol from\nthe Commerce Clause. The Constitution -- the Twenty-First\nAmendment constitutionalized that Commerce Clause\nframework.\" That's what this Court said in Craig v.\nBoren. Craig v. Boren also said, \"The Twenty-First\nAmendment creates an exception to the operation of -- the\nnormal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then you are asking us,\nI guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first\none that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and\nwell? Was it Justice Stewart? And I forgot which case it\nwas. It was -\nMR. CASEY: That may be. The Commerce Clause\nremains alive and well, but the Commerce Clause -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the context of alcoholic\nbeverages.\nMR. CASEY: In the context of powers expressly\nconferred upon the states by the Twenty-First Amendment,\nthat's an exception to the operation -- the normal\noperation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause\nhas to be read in light of the Twenty-First Amendment,\njust as the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read in light\nof the Commerce Clause and other provisions of the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a different\nargument than the one you made before, which seems to be\nsaying the Twenty-First Amendment trumps, not that the two\nhave to be harmonized.\nMR. CASEY: When you read the two in light of\neach other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the\npurpose of the Twenty-First Amendment was to remove\nalcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional\nmatter, to prevent Congress from tampering with it in the\nfuture, to give the judgement to the states as to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you --\nMR. CASEY: -- the necessity for -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you say further than that;\nyou say the purpose was to allow that the states\ndiscriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.\nMR. CASEY: That is one of the purposes, yes.\nIn that -- in the case that was decided immediately after\nthe Young's Market, Mahoney, and Indianapolis Brewing, the\nCourt said, \"Discrimination is permissible in this narrow\ncontext, where the state is acting pursuant to its Twenty\nFirst Amendment powers and regulating importation of\nalcohol.\"\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that gets us back to\nBacchus and what to make of that.\nMR. CASEY: I -- as I indicated, I don't believe\nBacchus overrules those cases; it didn't even cite most of\nthose cases. But -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the dissent seemed to\nthink so -\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- didn't it?\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. But, as I said, we\nbelieve Bacchus is distinguishable, because that was mere\nprotectionism, the state does have other justifications\nhere -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we've also said that\nmere protectionism is permitted.\nMR. CASEY: Mere protectionism is permitted. In\nthis case, if we have to present other justifications, we\nhave, and there are other justifications, unlike the\nsituation in Bacchus. So even if the Bacchus rationale is\ngood law, we still prevail on that.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Halligan?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN HALLIGAN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 03-1274\nMS. HALLIGAN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn answer to your question first, Justice\nBreyer, the Twenty-First Amendment does not propose a\nnondiscriminatory ban. The Court rejected that position,\nnot just in Young's Market and Mahoney in Indianapolis,\nbut also in Clark Distilling, the case in which the Court\nupheld the constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act,\nitself. It held that the Webb-Kenyon Act operated to\nremove any immunity that had been conferred by the dormant\nCommerce Clause. Bacchus is not to the contrary. In\nNorth Dakota, which follows Bacchus, the Court relied\nagain on Young's Market to say that the states could\nimpose different rules on out-of-state vendors where they\nwere necessary to protect the integrity -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you take the\nposition that your colleague on your same side takes, that\na state can permit only the sale, consumption, and -- of\nits own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The express terms of the Twenty\nFirst Amendment would allow that if -- particularly if it\nwere necessary to advance the concerns of the Twenty-First\nAmendment. For example -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, don't -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't put in the\nqualifications.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just for local\nprotectionism.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Simply for mere protectionism?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just for local\nprotectionism. We want to promote our wines, and not\nanybody else's.\nMS. HALLIGAN: The terms of the amendment would\nallow that, but I don't think the Court needs to explore\nthe outer parameters of the Twenty-First -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm trying to understand\nwhat your -\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- the Twenty-First -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what your theory is. And\nso you are in agreement with your colleague that this\ncould be done, if New York chose. You can only drink New\nYork-grown wines in -- sell and consume -- in the state of\nNew York.\nMS. HALLIGAN: It could be done, but that\nquestion really isn't presented here, because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But could Congress pass a law\nforbidding it?\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's a difficult question,\nbecause -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. All right. But I need\nan answer to it.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because, you see, what's going\nto come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, \"Well,\ndidn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?\"\nMS. HALLIGAN: Let me answer both of those\nquestions, if I can, Your Honor. Certainly, this Court\nhas held, repeatedly, that the Twenty-First Amendment did\nnot, in any substantial way, completely repeal Congress'\naffirmative power under the Commerce Clause. It said that\nin Midcal and Capital Cities. But we would argue that if\nCongress acted in a way which completely removed state\nauthority to determine whether or not alcohol could be\nsold and the terms under which it could be sold -- for\nexample, if Congress said all states must be dry -- then\nwe would argue that the Twenty-First Amendment wouldn't\nallow that, because that would completely eviscerate any\nstate authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can that be? I mean, if\nthis is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce\nClause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by\nenacting a statute?\nMS. HALLIGAN: The legislative history makes\nclear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to\neliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce\nClause and authorize states to regulate it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you want us to read\nit by its terms. It doesn't say anything about the\ndormant Commerce Clause. If we read it absolutely the way\none of your arguments wants us to do, surely it excludes\nCongress.\nMS. HALLIGAN: By terms of our -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't want us to read it\nabsolutely.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, I don't think that -\nagain, I don't think that you need to decide those\nquestions in this case. This case goes to what's at the\nvery core of the Twenty-First Amendment, whether states\ncan decide who can sell liquor to their citizens and\nwhether or not states -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it also goes to the very\ncore of the Commerce Clause. And there are really two\nclassifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases. One is\n-- and I think it's an improper use of the term \"dormant\nclause\" -- is where there's discrimination. Only the\nCongress can allow discrimination against out-of-state\nproducts. That's one whole classification. And that's\nwhat's -- and that's what's involved here.\nMS. HALLIGAN: North Dakota indicates otherwise,\nI believe, Your Honor. In North Dakota, this Court said\nthat, because, when alcohol flows across the border, it\nposes unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the\nstate can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of\nits regulatory and supervisory powers, that it may be\nappropriate and necessary for states to impose unique\nrules on out-of-state vendors. In North Dakota, the Court\ndid not say -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's fine. And the\nother side isn't denying that here, that if, you know,\nthey're -- discrimination means treating out-of-state\npeople differently without good reason.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But there is good reason -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if you're willing to -\nokay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're\nhalfway there and we're just arguing about whether there\nis good reason here or not.\nMS. HALLIGAN: There is good reason here, Your\nHonor. What's critical about New York's law, as well as\nMichigan's law, is that it requires that any alcohol\nvendor have a physical presence in the state. And that's\nimportant for a couple of reasons. The state can't\nmeaningfully oversee traffic in alcohol with an out-of-\nstate entity. Petitioner suggested -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is it doing with the in\nstate entities? I mean, one of the claims is that nobody\nis posting officers outside the in-state wineries, no\none's making substantial physical audits of in-state\nwineries. Is that wrong?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It is wrong, Your Honor. It's\ncertainly not the case that we have an SLA inspector\noutside every entity that sells liquor. That would not be\npossible. But it is true that the state liquor authority\ncan, and does, physically inspect the premises. They do\nso to determine whether -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do they inspect them for?\nTheir books, I suppose.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, more than that, and this is\nwhy the physical presence is important and why the\nInternet hypothetical that Your Honor raised would not -\nwould not satisfy the state's concerns. What the state\ncan do is, it can go onto a premises, and it can count\nwhether the bottles on the shelves of that premises match\nthe records. That's the best way to detect whether or not\nthere is evasion. Because if you have -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And is there a record that the\nstate is doing that?\nMS. HALLIGAN: There is not clear evidence in\nthe record with respect to that -- to that level of\ndetail, but that -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't that the end of\nthat issue, then? I mean, it is your burden, isn't it?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, there is material in\nthe McKeon affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix -\nMr. McKeon is the Chair of the state liquor authority -\nbut it's also the case that to suggest that because there\nis some option out there -- and there's no firm evidence\nthat a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the\nstate's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion\n-- but the possibility that's there's some rule out there,\nbecause other states have adopted more lax rules, is to\ntreat alcohol like any other product. And the Twenty\nFirst Amendment reflects a consensus by this nation that\nalcohol is unique, that it should not be open to -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Twenty-First\nAmendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated\nas unique, and the issue here is whether you're really\ndoing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And, so far, the one specific\nthing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do go\non winery premises, and they count bottles, and they see\nif they match what's on the written record.\nMS. HALLIGAN: They also draw on the assistance\nof local law enforcement. And this is also -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if that's -\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- set forth -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if that's really what New\nYork's concern is, then why does New York say, \"Ah, but\nout-of-staters, if only you establish an office here -\nnot a winery; an office -- you can operate, and you can\nmake the direct sales from that office, and even in\" -- I\nthink your brief told us that, well, these small wineries,\nout-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry\nabout, because, after all, they could join together -- a\ngroup of them could open an office. Now, that office,\nowned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going to\nhave bottles on the shelf, is it?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor, it would.\nThat's -- the state laws requires that any licensed winery\nhave a government-bonded storehouse or ware-room -\nstorehouse -- storeroom or warehouse, pardon me --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, isn't the -\nMS. HALLIGAN: The reason for that is because\nphysical products -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you envision this\ncombination of small wineries? You said that in-state\nestablishments might be jointly maintained by out-of-state\nwineries.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor. The state\nliquor authority has not issued any regulations on this,\nbut presumably what they would say is, you could share a\nspace, provided that the physical property of each winery,\nthe bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in\nand check whether or not each winery's products conform\nwith their records.\nThere are other reasons why a physical presence\nis important, as well. First of all, the state draws on\nlocal law enforcement extensively to identify illegal\nactivities, and that would not be possible with any entity\nlocated out-of-state. Additionally -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What illegal -- I'm sorry -\nyou've got to be specific. What illegal activities?\nSelling to minors?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It could be selling to minors,\nbut it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensed\npremises, where you are selling outside the proper hours\nof sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but if licensed premises\ndon't serve a state interest, then you can't require a\nlicensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far.\nMS. HALLIGAN: But, Your Honor, the principle\nthat having entities that sell liquor be licensed, is one\nthat is at the heart, not just at the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does -- how does requiring\nthem to have an in-state office somehow prevent them from\nshipping to minors from out of state -\nMS. HALLIGAN: It -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or from shipping to\nconsumers from out of state without paying you their tax?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does the opening of an -\nMS. HALLIGAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- an office in New York State\nat all prevent that?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It can't prevent it a hundred\npercent, but no -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It can't prevent it at all.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, it can deter it, and\nit can deter it significantly, because, first of all,\nthere is a much more significant opportunity to identify\nthe illegal activities; and, secondly, if a retailer or a\nwholesaler or a manufacturer knows that, that operates as\na powerful deterrent -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What did -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We seem to be talking -- may I\njust ask one -- we seem to be talking about two different\nthings. Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the\nlicense and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from\noutside. And I -- is that the assumption? Or is your\nargument that New York can require -- does require the in\nstate warehouse, and you can ship into -- in New York, you\ncan ship only from that warehouse?\nMS. HALLIGAN: To be clear, the state has not\nissued regulations that specifically address that point,\nbecause -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- we don't know yet.\nMS. HALLIGAN: We don't know. But in talking\nwith the state liquor authority, they have made it clear\nthat their intent would be to require that the liquor come\nfirst to the in-state premises -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, even if -- I'm willing to\nassume that. How does that guarantee that the out-of-\nstate winery will not, in violation of New York State law,\nship directly to minors or ship directly to consumers,\njust simply bypassing its cache of wine in New York?\nMS. HALLIGAN: There is no guarantee, Your\nHonor, but there is never any guarantee -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's no guarantee.\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- that people won't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't enable\nyou to enforce your law any more rigorously than without\nhaving a requirement for a local office.\nMS. HALLIGAN: That, I would respectfully\ndisagree with. It does operate as a powerful deterrent\nand -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument there is\nthat -\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- as an investigative aid.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if they break the law, you\ncan shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't\neffectively do that if the warehouse is in California.\nIsn't that your point?\nMS. HALLIGAN: That's one of the points, but\nalso that we're much more likely to be able to identify\nthe illegal activities in the first place. The suggestion\nthat we would send inspectors to California or any other\nplace to look at books and count bottles is completely\ninfeasible. And the Twenty-First Amendment was intended\nto allow states to deal with the regulatory challenges\nthat are posed when liquor comes across the border. If we\nhad to demonstrate that there was a hundred-percent\ncompliance, then we couldn't have any regulation at all.\nThat's not, I would submit, a -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to what -\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- reasonable measure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to what extent does New\nYork take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the\nstates from which this wine is coming? You say we must do\nthis to police for all kinds of things. But don't other\nstates -- California, Virginia -- don't they have laws\nthat their local wineries must meet?\nMS. HALLIGAN: They -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is New York just saying,\n\"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally\nunregulated, anyway\"?\nMS. HALLIGAN: We're not suggesting that, Your\nHonor. What we are suggesting is that relying on other\nstates to enforce law violations in New York State is not\na very feasible alternative. Additionally, there are 33\nstates that have agreed with New York, a number of whom\nare states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted\nshipping statutes, and said to this Court, \"Please do not\nprohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York\nand Michigan.\" So it's obviously important to the\nregulators in those states, as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the states that do a\nallow shipment from out of state? They don't care about\ntheir --\nMS. HALLIGAN: I can't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many are there that allow\nshipment from out-of-state wineries?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I believe that the current number\nis 26 states. I certainly can't speak to the regulatory\nmotivations of each of those states, or the reasons why\nthose laws might have been passed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly suggests that what\n-- that what you're arguing is not essential to the\nstate's enforcement of its alcohol laws.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, a number of those states\nhave, in fact, joined New York and Michigan in asking the\nCourt not to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: States don't like federal\nregulation -\nMS. HALLIGAN: -- restrict that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- of any sort, of course. I\nknow that.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, I think that all the\nTwenty-First Amendment requires the states to demonstrate\nis that the regulatory regime that they have chosen has\nsome relationship to their goals of protecting the\nintegrity of the state's system. And that's certainly\nwhat the Court suggested in North Dakota.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure. When you\nhave facial discrimination against out-of-state products,\nI think you're -- the bar is a little higher than that.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, that was the case in North\nDakota, as well. In North Dakota, the state imposed\nregulations on out-of-state vendors that were extremely\nonerous, so onerous that some vendors said they wouldn't\nship products at all. That was alcohol that was not even\ndestined for consumption within the state; but on a\nfederal enclave. And the mere risk of diversion into\nunregulated and unlawful channels was enough to allow the\nstate to impose those discriminatory rules. The same is\ntrue here.\nJustice O'Connor, you also asked about Bacchus,\nas well, and I would like to take a moment to address\nthat.\nBacchus is distinguishable in several ways.\nFirst of all, Bacchus was a tax. And while we would argue\nthat taxes could be used to further states' interest in\nsuppressing consumption, for example, it is certainly not\nat the heart of the -- of the Twenty-First Amendment in\nthe way that the direct regulation of alcohol across the\nborder is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if you can't grant a\ntax exemption -- and it seems to me, a fortiori -- you\ncan't grant a prohibition about importing at all.\nMS. HALLIGAN: I, respectfully, would disagree\nwith that, Your Honor. If you can't address the alcohol\nthat flows across the border, which was precisely why the\nTwenty-First Amendment was enacted, as well as Webb\nKenyon, because the -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm suggesting a tax on\nimports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, we would certainly, you\nknow, welcome the authority to do both, but importation is\nwhat is at the heart of the Twenty-First Amendment.\nBacchus is also different, because, there, the state made\nno effort whatsoever to defend the statute with reference\nto any concerns related to the Twenty-First Amendment.\nAnd Bacchus -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And according to the District\nCourt, in this very case, the State Attorney General\nconceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by\nin-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.\nMS. HALLIGAN: That was an off-the-cuff remark\nby a single attorney, Your Honor, and that can't be taken\nas dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this\nstatute. It also was regarding a provision that is not\neven directly before the Court right now which confers no\ndifferent shipment privileges than are conferred on any\nwinery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would\nobtain a license to sell in New York.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Halligan.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Bolick, you have, let's\nsee, about four minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLINT BOLICK\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1274\nMR. BOLICK: Thank you, Justice Stevens. Three\nvery brief points.\nThere his a panoply of tools available to states\nto police out-of-state wineries in direct shipping, as the\nFederal Trade Commission has recognized. They can, if\nthey issue a permit, revoke that permit. And New York has\nauthority to issue such permits under Section 105-9. The\nTwenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, for which the\nliquor distributors and states lobbied very hard, gives\ninjunction authority in the home federal courts. And, of\ncourse, the federal agency, the Tax and Trade Bureau, can\nrevoke a permit if state law is violated. In the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who's going to count the\nbottles?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BOLICK: Your Honor, the state -- the\nFederal Government is able to count those, but the\nevidence is that they don't. And that goes back to a\nquestion, I believe, Justice Souter asked. In the\nMichigan case, a question was posed in an interrogatory,\n\"What enforcement by -- is done of in-state wineries.\" In\nthat regard, the answer was, \"None.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you count bottles? I\nwould have thought the consumers have all the bottles.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BOLICK: That's exactly right. And,\ncertainly in the directly shipping context in-state, that\nis emphatically the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think they were referring to\nfull bottles. I guess -\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BOLICK: With direct shipping -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They've all been drinking -\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- to arbitrators.\nMR. BOLICK: With direct shipping, Justice\nScalia, we can personalize things.\nIn terms of the Bacchus case, as Justice\nGinsburg pointed out, New York, like Hawaii, conceded\nprotectionism. It is very rife in the legislative record\nin 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished. In\n1995, when Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have\nsolved this problem, he said, and I quote -- and this is\nin the record, the Joint -- the Second Circuit Joint\nAppendix, at 442 -- he said, and I quote, \"Since the vast\nmajority of this country's wines are produced in\nCalifornia, I believe that this bill would inevitably lead\nto a significant increase in mail-order wines from that\nstate into New York. This increase could, in turn, lead\nto a decrease in sales for New York liquor stores and\ntheir distributors, and shrink New York wineries' market\nshare. That is protectionism.\"\nAnd, finally, the notion that small winemakers\ncould go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do\nthis -- if you could drive out to Middleburg and visit\nJuanita Swedenburg's winery -- and she invites you to do\nso --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. BOLICK: -- you will find Mrs. Swedenburg\nselling wine, harvesting grapes, and bottling. This is a\nban on -- this is market foreclosure, sure and simple -\nfewer than 600 wineries are represented on the stores of\nNew York's shelves, out of over 3,000 wineries -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The question -\nMR. BOLICK: -- in the United States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- really is whether the plain\nlanguage of the Twenty-First Amendment allows that very\nprotectionism.\nMR. BOLICK: And I would refer you, in my brief\ntime remaining, to the brief, the Carter-Phillips brief\nfor the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the DKT Liberty\nbrief, which go into the history of the Twenty-First\nAmendment, which was intended to restore the police power,\nwhich did not include the power to discriminate. Our\nclients cannot compete with the liquor distributors in the\npolitical marketplace in their -- in their -- in their\nhome states. They can, however, compete in the economic\nmarketplace. The Commerce Clause protects that right,\nthat level playing field. The Twenty-First Amendment was\nnever intended to take it away.\nWe ask this Court, respectfully, to honor 124\nyears of precedent in the National Economic Union.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Bolick. The\ncase is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
