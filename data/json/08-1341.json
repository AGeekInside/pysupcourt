        "content": "(11:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Case 08-1341, United States v. Marcus.\nMr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals erred in holding that\nreversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate on\nplain error review if there was any possibility, no\nmatter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was based\nentirely on conduct predating the enactment of the\nstatute.\nUnder Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a\nforfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at\na minimum a reasonable possibility that the error\nactually affected the outcome of the case. In\nparticular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error\ntest requires a defendant to show a serious effect on\nthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\nproceedings. That test calls for a case-specific,\nfact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy\nit if there is no reasonable possibility that the error\naffected the outcome.\nThe decision of the court of appeals is\ninconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four\nof the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most\nrecently Puckett from just last term. Puckett\nestablished that the prong four inquiry is case-specific\nand fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four\nis inappropriate. And that's exactly what the court of\nappeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if\nthere's any possibility of prejudice, reversal is\nrequired.\nIn addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear\nthat when the error is one that affects an issue on\nwhich the evidence is overwhelming or essentially\nuncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious\neffect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\nof judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that\ncontext on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't\naffect the outcome would undermine public confidence in\nthe judicial system.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there errors that\nare -- that are so basic that they would call for an\nautomatic new trial? You say this -- this is not such\na -- such an error.\nMR. MILLER: This Court has reserved the\nquestion of whether, for example, a structural error\nwould automatically satisfy the \"affects substantial\nrights\" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano\ntest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by\n\"structural\"?\nMR. MILLER: Well, the sort of error that,\nif properly preserved, would result in automatic\nreversal without an assessment of harmlessness.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but if you can be\nconcrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what\nelse would be structural?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean in Johnson, for\nexample, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in\nJohnson it was unclear whether the omission of one\nelement, the failure to instruct the jury on one element\nof the offense, was a structural error. And in Johnson,\nthe Court said, even assuming that that's a structural\nerror and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has\nsatisfied prong three, showing an effect on the\nsubstantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has\nto apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of\nthe record and the facts in that particular case whether\nthere was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\nAnd in that case, the Court said that there\nwasn't, because the evidence on the point that was the\nsubject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and\nessentially uncontroverted. And that's, in our view, the\nsort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment\nof the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken\nin this case.\nThe effect of the decision below is\nessentially to carve out a special rule of plain error\nreview that's applicable only to a particular kind of\nerror; namely --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this? Prong\nthree of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right? And\nthen it's your position that prong four also looks to\nprejudice? Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one\nis more searching than the other, perhaps?\nHow do they fit together in that relation --\nin that regard?\nMR. MILLER: Well, that's -- that's right.\nWe think that prong three in the case of a\nconstitutional error requires at least a reasonable\npossibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demands\nat least that much and, in some cases, may demand more.\nOne example of a case where a defendant\ncould satisfy prong three but not prong four would be,\nfor example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error. If you had\na drug possession case where the only evidence that the\nsubstance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a\nlaboratory certificate admitted without confrontation,\nthat would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and\nthat would -- the defendant would be able to show an\neffect on his substantial rights, because if that was\nthe only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled\nto a directed verdict without it. Nonetheless --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under three.\nMR. MILLER: Under prong three. But looking\nat prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, for\nexample, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoena\nthe chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of the\nreport, there would be no basis for concluding on those\nfacts that there was a serious effect on the fairness or\nintegrity or reputation of the proceedings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You answered Justice Alito\nby saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more\nsearching, more demanding, under four. It might also be\nthe other way around. I mean, if you satisfy -- if,\nunder three, you find that it hasn't affected the\noutcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.\nMR. MILLER: If, under three, the defendant\nfails, then you don't need to apply prong four, because\nprong four -- prong four is essentially an\nimplementation of the discretion conferred by the word --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. MILLER: -- \"may\" in Rule 52(b). In\norder for the court to have any authority to correct\na plain error, it must be one that affects substantial\nrights. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. There -- there is an\noverlap.\nMR. MILLER: There is some overlap in the\ninquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court\nmade clear in Puckett, rule four requires a\nfact-intensive, case-specific inquiry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So under -- under three, the\ncourt could conclude that the defendant has shown that\nit isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a\nconstitutional error, that the error didn't affect the\noutcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but\nin prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's\nfairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that --\nis that -- that how it would work?\nMR. MILLER: Or if, you know, as in the --\nmy Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence\nin the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect\non the defendant's rights of that particular error, that\nerror, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine\npublic confidence in the outcome.\nWhat the court of appeals did here was to\ncreate a special rule applicable only to those errors\ninvolving the failure to instruct the jury that they may\nnot convict solely on pre-enactment evidence. The court\ndidn't give any reason why those errors should be\ntreated differently from other kinds of errors.\nInstead, it was simply applying a line of circuit\nprecedent that went back to cases predating Olano.\nAnd there is no reason for creating a\nspecial rule in that context. To the contrary, Johnson\nemphatically rejected the proposition that there are\nerrors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis. And\nthe Court said that even errors implicating fundamental\nconstitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth\nAmendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth\nAmendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also\nsubject to the application --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want us to do it,\nright? You want us to remand it so that they can do it,\nright? Is that --\nMR. MILLER: This Court's usual practice\nwhen there's an issue that wasn't passed upon below is\nto leave it to be considered on remand. We think that's\nparticularly appropriate because of the fact- and\nrecord-intensive nature of the argument in this case.\nSo, if the Court does reach that issue, we\nwould urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the\nconcurring judges below, who said that, with respect to\nthe forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the\npre-enactment and post-enactment periods were\nessentially identical, such that there is no basis in\nthe record on which a rational jury could have concluded\nthat he violated the statute in the pre-enactment\nperiod --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The point may be\ntangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date\nproblem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and\nthe jury was later properly instructed, do you think\nthat the government would find it important to introduce\nthe evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set\nforth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury\nthe story?\nMR. MILLER: Indeed, it would. In order to\nestablish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the\ngovernment had to show that Respondent had obtained\nlabor services by threats of serious harm or by a\nscheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to\nbelieve that she would suffer serious harm.\nAnd so, in this case, there was essentially a\nuniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaining\nlabor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed,\nbrutally carrying out those threats. And so the\npre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying\nout the threats would certainly be relevant to show that\nthe post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats\nand that the victim could take them seriously as\nthreats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide\nthe labor or services.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument\nthat was made that in the pre-enactment period the\nWeb site was created, and that's when the -- that was the\nreally hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to\ndate?\nMR. MILLER: Well, there -- I mean, the\nstatute refers to \"labor or services.\" And creating a\nWeb site is a kind of labor or service, and maintaining a\nWeb site is also a kind of labor or service. And\nthere's -- as the concurring judges in the court of\nappeals noted, there's no basis on which the jury could\nhave concluded that one satisfies the statute but the\nother does not. They're both -- they both fall\ncomfortably within the ordinary meaning --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Miller, can I ask you\nthis question? We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not --\nas construed in Olano, which has developed the four\nfactors.\nIn your view, does the character of the\nviolation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does\nthat ever make a difference? Could a court ever think\nthat one kind of constitutional violation is a little\nbit more serious than another, or are they all fungible?\nMR. MILLER: I think in Johnson the Court\nquite clearly said that even very serious constitutional\nerrors are subject to the same analysis under\nRule 52(b). And certainly there's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, but the same\nconstitutional analysis includes step four, which is\nwhether it undermines confidence in the result. And\ndon't you think that some constitutional violations more\nundermine confidence than others?\nMR. MILLER: Absolutely. And the test that\nwould be applied would be the same, but the result of\nthat test might be different. For example, if the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it not also be\npossible that some constitutional violations undermine\nconfidence a little more than others?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. I mean, if the error were,\nfor example, a biased judge -- I mean, that would be one\nthat would almost invariably undermine confidence in\nthe integrity of the proceedings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then why is the Second\nCircuit so wrong to say: We think ex post facto\nviolations are perhaps a little more serious than some\nothers.\nMR. MILLER: Well, because the error, the\nessential error in this case, was the failure to give\nthe jury an instruction telling them that they could not\nconvict on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. And that\nis essentially analogous to the error that you had in\nJohnson, where there was a failure to give the jury an\ninstruction telling them that they had to find\nmateriality. And there --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are all omissions in jury\ninstructions fungible, then? I'm -- here we have an\nomission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post\nFacto Clause. Does -- the fact that it relates to the\nEx Post Facto Clause doesn't give it any extra weight or\nany lesser weight in the analysis?\nMR. MILLER: I think in the context of an\nerror like this, there isn't any reason to attach extra\nweight --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if the\ninstruction told the jury in a criminal case that you\ncan find the defendant guilty if you think it more\nlikely than not that he committed the crime, that might\nbe different, don't you think?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. That very well might be\ndifferent. That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this is\nex post facto, as opposed to a general due process\nviolation?\nMR. MILLER: No. I mean -- that's right.\nThe Ex Post Facto Clause regulates the content of the\nlaws that Congress can pass, and there would be an ex\npost facto issue in the case if Congress had tried to\nmake section 1589 retroactive, but it didn't. And\neveryone agrees that section 1589 applies only\nprospectively.\nSo the constitutional violation, if there is\none, comes from the possibility that the defendant could\nhave been convicted on the basis of Congress -- of\nconduct that did not violate the statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- you agree\nthat there is a violation?\nMR. MILLER: There is a violation in the\nfailure to instruct. And we think it's the\nDue Process Clause that is the source of the requirement\nthat the defendant not be convicted on the basis of the\nconduct that doesn't violate a statute.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fahringer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD PRICE FAHRINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FAHRINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it\nplease the Court:\nWe do believe there are errors that are so\nbasic that they require a reversal automatically. And\ncertainly one of them is trying a person for conduct for\n2 years that violated no law. It's almost\nunimaginable and it's unheard of. There are very few\ncases that even come close to resembling --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that I think\nmost trial judges would have admitted this evidence with\nthe proper instruction to the jury, that it's background\nevidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and\njust begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to\nthem.\nMR. FAHRINGER: That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I agree there was not\na proper instruction here, there should have been an\nobjection, and so forth. But in an ordinary trial, this\nevidence would have come in with the proper limiting\ninstruction.\nMR. FAHRINGER: What's so important about\nthat, if it please Your Honor, is that he couldn't have\nbeen convicted on that evidence. The court would have\ninstructed that this evidence was received --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of -- of -- of course, the\njury would have to be instructed very carefully.\nMR. FAHRINGER: But here, Your Honor, all\nthis evidence came in, and he could be convicted and was\nconvicted on the -- what we lend -- we think lends an\nawful lot of force to our argument here is that the\ngovernment has conceded that he could have been\nconvicted exclusively on the pre-enactment conduct\nalone. That that was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Convicted, but not --\nthere was a possibility, but not a reasonable\npossibility. That is, it's conceivable, but the\ngovernment also is urging the reasonable\npossibility that it is not likely, given the character of\nthe evidence in the post-enactment period.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, Your Honor, I\nunderstand that, but I certainly -- I'd like to say\nfirst, in terms of the concession that was made here, you\nare talking about 2 years of conduct that came into a\ntrial that is really quite extraordinary and terribly\ndynamic.\nThe one -- last third of that, Your Honor, I\nthink cannot -- even though it came post-statute, it\ncannot be used to legitimatize that first 2 years.\nAnd -- and the jury heard all of it, and -- and as a\nmatter of fact, what we attach a great deal of importance\nto, the last question the jury asked of the judge: We\nwant to know what constitutes labor.\nAnd they put in their note the -- the\nlargest task of all, the building and the designing of\nthe Web site and then maintaining it. And that was all\npre-enactment; the threats were all pre-enactment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this was a long -- a\nlong jury deliberation.\nMR. FAHRINGER: It was out for 7 days,\nYour Honor. Seven days the jury deliberated over this\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Kennedy suggested\nthat, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, it\nwould have come in to show pattern, scheme. So it's one\n-- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not\nhave seen that evidence, would not have heard the\nevidence, and another to say the judge should have\ncharged them: Now, you cannot use this evidence that\nyou've heard for another purpose. You cannot use it to\ndetermine his guilt or innocence.\nMR. FAHRINGER: But -- but, Your Honor, I\nwanted to mention to the Court, of course, Rule 403 that\nsays that if the prejudice of the evidence outweighs the\nprobative value. I think if we could take ourselves\nback to that trial court and a lawyer stood up and said,\nYour Honor, we want to put in 2 years of background\nevidence, I -- I think there's a good likelihood that\nit would have been excluded. I don't think you can\nsay --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you can be pleased\nthat I was not the trial judge.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FAHRINGER: Sorry to hear that, Your\nHonor.\nBut in the -- in the course of taking in\nsome evidence as background, I don't think it's ever\nbeen of this magnitude in a unique case where the\nevidence that's coming in bears directly on the\nliability. And I think the -- the question is terribly\nimportant because, obviously, it shows the jury was\nfocused on the pre-enactment conduct, even with the\nforced labor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I assume you could make all\nthat argument on remand, if we remand it. But what's\nyour argument -- apparently from what I've read in this\ncase, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error\nthat nobody else uses.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it says that all the other\ncircuits say: This is our set of standards, and we've\nset them forth. And the Second Circuit says: No, it's\n-- you have to have a new trial if there's any\npossibility, no matter how unlikely.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, nobody else uses that.\nIt seems contrary to our cases, and is there any\njustification for their using it?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because unless I can hear a\njustification, I would guess I would vote to say send it\nback and let them use the same standard anybody else\ndoes.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, one point you make,\nYour Honor, that I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to\nthat?\nMR. FAHRINGER: It's certainly welcome, and\nthat is that we are seeking a retrial here. You know,\nyou speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the\ngentleman can be tried on that conduct that was\npost-enactment.\nBut in response to Your Honor's question, I\nthink, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in\nthis whole case is, it all ran together in front of the\njury, and they saw all of this proof with no\ninstruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the --\nthe mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in\nfront of that had to have a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why don't you make\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Address the test used by\nthe Second Circuit. That's what we're concerned about.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what the\nquestion pertained to. They're using a test nobody\nelse used, that does not comport with -- with our prior\nopinions. Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them,\nyou know, use the right test?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, I think -- and I\nchoose my words carefully -- I think that this test\nunder this circumstance was justified. When the court\nsaw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say if\nthere was any possibility that the jury\nrelied exclusively --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The very magnitude of\nthe error would argue for -- you'd win on any test.\nI mean, why does that say you have to use a special test\nthat is specially designed to find when there is hardly\nany error? Here there's such a bigger error,\naccording -- that you think that you would have won\nunder any test.\nSo that -- so why -- why do you do have to\nhave this special favorable test? That's -- that's the\nquestion that I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of\nwhether you are right or whether you are wrong on the --\nhow much evidence there was and how awful it was.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I think -- to answer Your\nHonor's question, which is a -- an incisive one, and\nthat is because, Your Honor, it's only -- the court made\nit very clear, we're only applying this test to ex post\nfacto, and I think in this instance you are right, the\nmagnitude of the error prompted them to say that if\nthere was any possibility that this 2 years of conduct\n-- the jury could have based their verdict\nexclusively on that, we think we had to be granted a new\ntrial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- may I ask this\nquestion about the -- I -- I should know this, but I\ndon't. To what extent has the regular test that my\ncolleagues referred to applied in ex post facto cases in\nother circuits?\nMR. FAHRINGER: The -- the Olano test, Your\nHonor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, the possibility test has\nbeen used in the Third Circuit in the Tykarsky case. It\nhas also been used in several States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Were those ex post --\nMR. FAHRINGER: -- Georgia being one.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- ex post facto cases?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that it isn't\nnecessarily a conflict between this case and all other\nplain error cases; it's a narrow category of cases\ninvolving ex post facto violations?\nMR. FAHRINGER: In the -- in this very\nnarrow category, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you call it an ex\npost facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with\nthe government; it's a due process violation.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what happened is\nimproper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre-\n-- pre-statute conduct. But it might have been evidence\nthat was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason.\nThat would be just as much of a -- a due process violation.\nWhat is special about the fact that the\nreason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was\nthat it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the\nstatute?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, as I know, you\nare aware of the Marks case. They held that the ex post\nfacto concept applied to judicial precedent as well, and\nthat was repeated in the Harris case in -- as well. But\nI think, Your Honor, certainly the whole strength and --\nand weight of the ex post facto law is present here.\nThe Second Circuit said that it certainly involves ex\npost facto implications. What you are doing is, you're\ntaking conduct that violates no law before the law is\npassed, and you're taking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And when a State court\nallows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an\nex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State\ncourt judgment. But that's not what occurred here.\nWhat occurred here is that the trial court let the jury\nconsider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction,\nwhich it should not have let the jury consider.\nAnd there's a lot of evidence that a court\nshould not have let the jury consider. I don't see\nanything particularly special about fact that the reason\nthis evidence shouldn't have been before the jury was\nthat it occurred before the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it not only allowed\nthe evidence before the jury, but it also told the jury\nit was sufficient to convict.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, that's right.\nIt -- it -- what is special about it is -- I think it's an\nextremely rare and irregular case that would allow 2\nyears of conduct to come into a case --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the -- what if the\nperiod -- the -- the period that was charged started 1\nday before the statute took effect?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, if it was -- Your\nHonor, my stand --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would -- would the test\nbe different? Now, if you have 1 day of pre-enactment\nconduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based\non that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't\nit? And so, therefore, if the test is any possibility,\nthe result is automatic new trial in that situation.\nIs -- is that where your argument leads?\nMR. FAHRINGER: My argument is, Your Honor,\nthat no person in this country under our Constitution\nshould be tried for 1 day on conduct that did not\nviolate a law. I -- I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true. And also no\nperson should be convicted with a confession that was\ncoerced. And no person should be convicted with\nevidence given under torture. And no person should be\nconvicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police.\nNow, for all those latter things, every\ncourt apparently uses the normal standard. So why would\nwe in this case use a special standard?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Well, it's different, Your\nHonor. In all of those cases, there was a law, at least\ngiving the court jurisdiction, that was violated. There's\na very serious question here whether there was\njurisdiction when they came in. Jurisdiction is derived\nsolely through statutes that are violated in the\ncriminal field.\nThere were no statutes. So there's a\nserious question of whether there was even jurisdiction.\nBut -- but what's different is it seems to me if you\nhave a law, a mail fraud law, and then there is some sort\nof a violation and a -- a suppression of evidence or\nwhatever other arguments you're going to make,\nthat's -- that's light years away from a situation where\nthere's absolutely no law to -- to violate. And the\nconduct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and,\ntherefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I beg your pardon.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's also no violation\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of\nthe Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law\nshall be passed.\nMR. FAHRINGER: But, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have -- you don't\nhave an ex post facto law that was passed here.\nYou have an incorrect jury charge. You have\nthe judge telling the jury that you could convict on the\nbasis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't.\nThat is not an ex post facto law.\nMR. FAHRINGER: But, Your Honor, I -- I --\nin all due respect, I invite your attention to your\ncase in Marks and -- and the Harris case where they have\nsaid that we have extended ex post facto to obviously\na -- a whole host of cases now that involve judicial\nprecedent and -- and the actions of prosecutors\nand what not.\nThis, I can't imagine in a way in terms of\nthe concept of ex post facto to put in 2 years of\nconduct that is not in violation of any law, that\ncertainly fits within the presiding spirit of the ex\npost facto concept that people shouldn't -- you know, if\nyou want to go back to our very basics, and that's what\nunique about this case, the entitlement to notice of\nwhat conduct is to be avoided, a statute that tells you\nwhat conduct you have to avoid, and all those --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking for Marks, where\nis that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Beg your pardon, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have mentioned several\ntimes the Marks case. What case is --\nMR. FAHRINGER: M-A-R-K-S.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?\nMR. FAHRINGER: That's in -- in our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it in your brief?\nMR. FAHRINGER: I -- I believe it was cited\nin our brief, Your Honor. I will give you that in just\na moment, if I may. But -- but I'm under the\nimpression, Your Honor, from our research that there\nwere a number of cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, see, I don't know\nwhat that case is. If it was a case in which we\nreversed a State supreme court because the State supreme\ncourt upheld the State statute that -- you know, that\nmade prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could\nsay that was an ex post facto violation through the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I think this comment is\nrelevant to what you just said. Our forefathers in --\nin imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the\nfew that they imposed on the States as well as the\nFederal Government, and I think that lends it force in a\nsense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as\ndoes the Federal Government.\nBut we feel, under all those circumstances\nhere, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very\ncritical fact, and that is the enormity of the error\nhere at being a -- a constitutional error, and we\ncertainly think a structural error, structural error in\nthe sense that it ran from the beginning of the case. The\ngrand jury should not have indicted on conduct that\nviolated no law. He should not have been arraigned. He\nshould not have been tried. He should not have\nconvicted. He should not have been considered. All of\nthis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your position\nthat two concurring judges said that evidence should not\nhave been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the\njury should have been told you can convict only on\npost -- whatever the date was? But they also pointed\nout that one of the most severe incidents fell in the\npost-enactment period. It was in April of 2001. It\nwas -- and that was vivid evidence properly --\nproperly used by the jury to determine guilt or\ninnocence.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I -- I understand that, and\nI think I know what you are referring to, Your Honor.\nI find much of the evidence in this case extremely\ndistasteful, but we are operating under a land of laws\nand Constitution. And it seems to me his rights are as\nimportant -- I know this Court appreciates that -- as\nany other person's.\nAnd the truth of the matter is that much of\nthis very unattractive evidence came in before the law\nwas ever enacted. And I think what happens is -- and this\nis a reality psychologically -- it all blends together, it\nall comes together. And without any kind of\ninstruction. I -- my view would be, under ex post facto\nprinciples, it would have ordinarily been excluded. It\nwouldn't have been brought in.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. This -- this\nevidence was improper because if the legislature had\nmade that action punishable when it occurred before the\nstatute was enacted, that would have been a violation of\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause. Now, in fact, the legislature\ndidn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause. But we do have the\nadmission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted,\nwhich is no different from evidence that should have not\nbeen admitted for some other reason.\nFor example, where the -- where the court\ngives an instruction that permits evidence to be\nconsidered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is\nirrelevant to the crime. And the jury says you can\nfind him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up\nin the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with\nthe crime.\nWhy is this any different from that? It's\njust evidence that the jury should not have been allowed\nto use for conviction. I don't see why there is\nanything special about the fact that the reason it\nshouldn't be used for conviction --\nMR. FAHRINGER: In all due --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is because it occurred\npre-statute.\nMR. FAHRINGER: In all due respect, Your\nHonor, I believe the cases and Supreme Court cases have\nheld that the ex post facto law has been extended to\njudicial precedent. And we cite those cases, Your\nHonor, in our brief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I thought\nwhat we have said that it's just a violation of due\nprocess to convict someone for conduct that was not\ncriminal when the conduct was -- was made. It's --\nit's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process\nviolation. It just -- it's a serious due process\nviolation.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I think you're right, Your\nHonor, in the sense that it's an ex post facto law being\napplied through the Due Process Clause. But the impact and\nthe force of that, I think, is still just as great and\njust as powerful. And -- and -- and the error here\nfactually is -- is absolutely enormous.\nAnd -- and what I think the very least a\ndefendant in his position is entitled to is -- he's\nsuffering under a 9-year sentence. I think he is\nentitled to have another trial where he is only confronted\nwith the evidence that came after the statute. And if\nthey're going to put in evidence that goes before that,\nthey would have to justify that under one of a number of\ndifferent concepts, Rule 404(b) or one of the others.\nAnd we would argue in that context -- none of\nthis was ever done in court -- under 403, if it was too\nextensive, the prejudice outweighs the probative value.\nAnd I think that many judges would be sympathetic to\nthat, for putting in a whole 2 years of conduct. Some\nmight come in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Courtesy -- courtesy of\nJustice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks\ncase. And the -- the summary of the case at the\nbeginning says: \"Petitioners were convicted of\ntransporting obscene materials in violation of the\nFederal statute.\" \"Held: The Due Process Clause of the\nFifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to\npetitioners of the Miller standards.\"\nIt was a due process case.\nMR. FAHRINGER: And the only thing that I would\nthink of immediately of that is, is the statute here. He\nwas -- there's no question the -- the -- the conduct\nwas forbidden by statutes in -- in time, but was applied\nin advance of those statutes, before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, the Due\nProcess Clause was violated when the court let that in.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I don't have a quarrel with\nyou on that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you have to\npersuade us that there is something special about a\nviolation of the Due Process Clause that lets in\nevidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations\nthat let in other evidence that should not properly be\nused to convict the defendant. And I frankly don't --\ndon't see why it's so special.\nMR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, I'm endeavoring\nto pursue it, but somewhat unsuccessfully.\nThis is not an evidentiary error. It is in\nevery sense a due -- an ex post facto error, but it is\nthrough the Due Process Clause. I think that there we\nmeet on common ground. It's through the Due Process\nClause that the Ex Post Facto Clause is made -- made\neffective in trial. But the truth of the matter is -- I\nmean, the indictment here, which you start with, charged\nthese crimes going all the way back to January of 1999,\nwhen the Act didn't come -- didn't become effective\nuntil October of 2000.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the conduct\nthat -- we didn't have -- what if we did not\nhave pre-enactment conduct? What if we -- if this\nstatute applies only within the United States, as I\nassume that it does, and all of the conduct that's now\npre-enactment was conduct that took place outside the\nUnited States? Would that -- would the case be\ndifferent for these purposes?\nMR. FAHRINGER: If all the conduct that was\nproven at the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Instead of having\npre-enactment conduct, you have conduct in Canada,\nMexico, someplace else.\nMR. FAHRINGER: I -- I think it would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the jury was\ninstructed that he could be convicted on the basis of\nwhat had happened in Canada. That would be the same?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes, that's right. And I --\nall I'm suggesting is, wherever the evidence comes from,\nit shouldn't be admitted except under one of the very\nnarrow exceptions, such as Rule 404(b). And we would\nargue, under 403, it should be excluded, wherever the\nevidence came from. And a judge would -- as I\nunderstand it, a judge would instruct the jury: You\ncannot convict Mr. Marcus on any of this evidence\nwhatsoever that is pre-enactment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, of course, but the\nquestion is whether the mere possibility standard would\napply in that case as well, or whether you think this\nmere possibility standard applies only in the case of\npre-enactment conduct?\nMR. FAHRINGER: I think the possibility\nstandard only applies to ex post facto statute\ncases and pre-enactment conduct. That's my view, Your\nHonor. I think it's a very narrow holding. And I'm\nnot urging that this would be the standard for other --\nother than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this\nwould be the standard in ex post facto cases where --\nwhat this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about\nit, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule.\nWhat has gone on in the past is we have to\nmeasure. We have to take, on the one hand, the post-\nenactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the\npre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I\n-- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before\nGideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in\nthat context whether a person got able representation\nuntil you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright.\nAren't we in the same position here?\nWouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where\nclearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment\nconduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct\nand there is any possibility that the jury convicted on\nthat, there will be a new trial? It seems that's going\nto avoid all of that balancing and weighing and\nperennial -- perennial appellate review. That's what I\nthink is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's\ndecision. I think that's where there is a great deal of\nsense behind it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is,\nessentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area;\nit's just error because it involved evidence\npre-enactment? That error is enough; it doesn't have to\nmeet --\nMR. FAHRINGER: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have to meet\nthe standard for plain error?\nMR. FAHRINGER: Yes, absolutely. And this\ndoesn't affect that whatsoever. I mean, I think there's\na misconception among some people. We -- the Second\nCircuit took the four Olano factors and applied\nthem, one, two, three, four. They didn't touch them.\nThey didn't in any way alter them.\nWhat they did is, on the concept and the\nrule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was\npurely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't\napply to plain error. Those four prongs have been left\nintact. And so they haven't disturbed that in any way\nwhatsoever. They set those four prongs out in the\npreamble of their opinion. Obviously, what they found\nwas, when you have a case of this magnitude of\npre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that\ncertainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the\ntrial and the judicial reputation.\nI say it myself. It appeared on the front\npage of The New York Times: Man convicted for 2 years\nof conduct where there was no law. That, I would guess,\nwould have an adverse effect on the reputation of our\njudicial process, whereas a ruling where a court held\nthis man should go back and get a new trial on the\nconduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct\nthat violated no law, would enhance the reputation of\nthe courts.\nSo applying that factor, we feel strongly\nand powerfully that the correct disposition here is to\naffirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. And\nwe will go back and we will have a retrial on the conduct\nthat violated the statute.\nIf you have no other questions, I -- I thank\nyou for your attention.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fahringer.\nMr. Miller, you have 16 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Just very brief -- excuse me --\nvery briefly, I'd like to make two points.\nThe first is that, essentially, the error in\nthis case was the failure to give a limiting instruction\nrelating to the use of pre-enactment evidence, and\nthat's the same sort of instructional or evidentiary\nerror that can be considered in a case-specific analysis\nunder prong four and should have been considered\nthrough that analysis.\nThe second is that Respondent suggested\nthere was a lack of jurisdiction in this case. That\nargument rests on an understanding of jurisdiction that\nthis Court rejected in Cotton, and we discussed that at\npages 9 to 11 of our reply brief.\nIf the Court has no further questions, we\nask that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
