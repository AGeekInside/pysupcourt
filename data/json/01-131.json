        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in case number 01-131, Gary Gisbrecht vs. Jo Anne\nBarnhart.\nSpectators are admonished, do not talk until\nyou get out of the courtroom. The Court remains in\nsession. Mr. Schnaufer?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAUFER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: We are asking this Court to recognize a\nsimple principle that a federal statute requires that an\nattorney fee be contingent on success in litigation, that\nwhen the court determines an attorney fee pursuant to that\nstatute, an attorney fee should reflect the contingent\nnature of the fee, thus because 406(b) requires a\ncontingent fee in Social Security cases, when the district\ncourt determined the reasonable fee pursuant to 406(b)\nthat attorney fee must reflect the contingent nature of\nthe fee.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a question about the\nlimits of the extent of the prohibition, whatever is in\n406(b). I think that can be read to deal only with the\nquestion where the attorney is seeking a recovery out of\nthe plaintiff's recovery.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's\npossible to interpret the statute in a way that would not\ncriminalize charging a claimant a noncontingent fee,\nhowever the existing practice in the bar is to take it as\nprohibiting charging a noncontingent fee?\nQUESTION: Well, there anything more\nauthoritative as the existing practice of the bar that\nwould lead to that conclusion?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: I would direct the Court's\nattention to the 406(b)(2) where it sets forth the\ncriminal penalties for violation of the statute. There is\nonly one appellate court to address whether or not a\nnoncontingent fee may be charged as the third circuit in\nCoup, but it doesn't reach the issue. Also one district\ncourt in Hutchinson cited in the amicus brief from the\nclaimants representatives addresses that.\nNo. I think even if the statute did not\nrequire a contingent fee when there was no judgment\nfavorable to the plaintiff, I believe that the vast\nmajority of claimants would voluntarily choose to enter\ninto contingent fee agreements.\nQUESTION: Because that's how they get counsel?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Absolutely. So even if the\nstatute didn't criminalize charging a noncontingent fee,\nthis would be the voluntary selection of the vast majority\nof --\nQUESTION: Well, if the statute, 406(b) reads\nas though when there is a judgment favorable to the\nclaimant, the court may allow a reasonable fee. And could\napparently determine that fee any way it saw fit?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: I believe this Court's decision\nin Christenberg Garments is relevant. That case also\naddresses whether the term, whether the court may award\nattorney fees interpreting that the court did, the\nattorney matter wasn't up to the court, that the court\nwould generally award the attorney fee in that fee\nshifting context. So yes, there are situations in which a\ndifferent --\nQUESTION: Well, it suggests perhaps that the\ncourt would allow a fee, but it seems open-ended that it\nwill allow the court to determine the fee any way it wants\non the lodestar method or via, by some other method.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice O'Connor, I believe\nthe statute should be interpreted relative to the legal\ncontext in which it was enacted in 1965, which additional\nrole of state courts rule on contingent fee agreements was\nto decide where the agreed upon amount between the parties\nwas excessive or abusive.\nQUESTION: That wasn't personal to any\nstatutory mandate, was it? Wasn't that that just the\nsupervisory power of the courts over fees?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, the federal courts in the\nearly '60s, in 1965, doubted whether they even had the\nauthority to rule on the appropriateness of a contingent\nfee. Congress clarified that by specifically providing\n406(b) so the court, the district court would determine\nthe reasonableness of a 406(b) fee. I believe that the --\nQUESTION: Well, you think the language of the\nstatute requires a contingent fee? At only reasonable fee\ncan be a contingent fee?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: That any attorney fee has to be\ncontingent on success in the litigation that could be\ndifferent fee agreements. For example, a plaintiff may\nagree to charge or to pay his or her attorney a flat fee\ncontingent on success in litigation or a specific hourly\nfee contingent on success in the litigation or for\nexample, a complex formula based on the success in\nlitigation.\nBut the attorney fee in our view --\nQUESTION: But you think that the implication\nof this statute is that the court has to base it on the\nagreement of the attorney and the attorney's client?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. I believe the relevant\ninquiry --\nQUESTION: Because it done say that. I think\nyou are reading something in that isn't there. And you\nare basing that on practice of lawyers at the time or\nsomething?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: But, Justice O'Connor. I\nbelieve that clearly in 1965, Congress could not have\nintended to adopt for this statute the lodestar method\ngiven that the lodestar method had not been invented until\na decade or so later and not really adopted by this Court\nuntil its decision in --\nQUESTION: Well, before lodestar, there were\nother descriptions for reasonable fees that depended on\nhours, degree of difficulty, etcetera etc. I mean,\nlawyers did that for decades.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. Yes, Justice Kennedy, and\nwhen a court was involved, the question would be whether\nthe agreed upon fee is reasonable or unreasonable, the\ncourt would not itself in the context when there was an\nexisting fee, fee agreement determine what it felt was the\nmost appropriate fee, so the primary question when there\nis a fee agreement and a fee request is whether the fee\nrequest, the agreed upon fee is reasonable.\nQUESTION: I think this is a very difficult\ncase because either way, we are going to be, I mean on\nwhich circuits involved, we are going to be upsetting\nstandard arrangements, contingent fees in some cases. In\nthis case, in the Ninth Circuit, are you saying that the\nfee, the fee the Ninth Circuit set was not reasonable?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Kennedy. For\nseveral reasons the attorney fee that the district courts\nin Ninth Circuit set was not reasonable. First and\nforemost, the district courts did not address the primary\nquestion whether the agreed upon fee was a reasonable fee.\nSecond, the district court who decided, who ordered the\nfees in Gisbrecht, Miller and Sandine, did not take into\naccount, did not have the attorney fees reflect the\ncontingent nature of the fee. The district courts awarded\nin all three cases noncontingent hourly rates,\nnoncontingent fees when by law, the attorney fee must be\ncontingent on success.\nQUESTION: Well, but, of course, that assumes\nthat you are correct here. But based on a standard of\nfair compensation, was this unfair compensation?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Quite without reference to your\nstatutory argument?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. Because when an attorney\nfee is contingent on success in the litigation, the\nattorney fee should reflect the contingent nature of the\nfee. In this case, even if there were not a prohibition\non charging noncontingent fee, the parties had freely\ncontracted that the attorney would be paid more taking\ninto account the risk of loss.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me you have got to\nget back to the statute and say why the statute should be\nread the way you want it to. This isn't an ordinary\nsituation event or of a contingent fee say in a personal\ninjury case which the court may have supervision over in\nthe general sense. Here the court doesn't say that the\nattorney shall enter into an agreement and the court shall\nenforce it. It says the court may determine and allow as\npart of its judgment a reasonable fee for such\nrepresentation. I think you have got to build from that\nand say why you think that the amount of the contingencies\nspecified in your contract is the one that the court has\nto follow.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthat the practice before 1965 is relevant. Attorneys were\nentering into contingent fee agreements with their clients\nto represent full representation in civil actions.\nCongress in an act in 406(b), did not void those\nagreements, did not say that attorneys should not charge a\ncontingent fee, but instead, chose to regulate the\ncontingent fee agreements.\nIf Congress had, if Congress had intended to\nprohibit attorneys from engaging, from making contingent\nfee agreements with their clients, force representation in\nfederal court, Congress really could have said so. I\nthink we have cited.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't say anything in\n(b)(1)(a) about contingent fees, does it?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: No. (B)(1)(a) reflects that\nthe attorney be must be contingent upon a favorable\njudgment.\nQUESTION: Well, if you get a favorable\njudgment --\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Right.\nQUESTION: You can get a fee.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Which isn't quite the same thing.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: We believe that the purpose of\nthe statute expressed by Congress is fully implemented by\nour view.\nQUESTION: Let me -- I'm having trouble\nfollowing your argument. And one reason is because I am\nusing the words differently than apparently you are. I\nunderstand we are in a universe where you are only going\nto get paid under this statute if you win. Am I right\nabout that.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right, so we all assume in that\nsense every fee is contingent.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes.\nQUESTION: But then I thought we were trying to\ndistinguish within that universe between some circuits\nthat say the way we should calculate that is by looking to\nwhat they call the lodestar, and other circuits that say\nthe way we calculate it is we look to the agreement and if\nthe agreement is for 25 percent of the recovery, that's\nwhere we start. Am I right?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice --\nQUESTION: All right. Now what is it that we\nare trying to decide? Are we trying to decide whether --\nwhat is it that you see us trying to decide within that\nuniverse?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Well, there are significant\nvariations of the lodestar method. The government now\nproposes that the lodestar method be the lodestar method\nfrom the fee shifting context, not taking into account the\ncontingent nature.\nQUESTION: All right. As far as I can see, the\nNinth Circuit says we start with the lodestar, but then it\ncan be adjusted for 12 factors. Number six of which is\nwhat I would call the contingent fee, namely, the one 25\npercent of the judgment written into the contract which is\nwhat I will use the word contingent to refer to, and so\nyou have the Ninth Circuit says first the lodestar\nadjusted for that, and then some other circuits say first\nstart with 25 percent contingency, but adjust it if that\nisn't reasonable. Now, that's how I was seeing it. Now,\nam I right?\nCorrect me if I'm not.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice, I believe there are\nvariations.\nQUESTION: And there are some variations, but\nthose are the two basic things. All right. As between\nthose two basic things, what is it you want us to say.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: We ask the court to, to specify\nthat when a district court determines a reasonable fee\nunder 406(b) it should start by asking first the question\nwhat is the agreed upon amount and is the agreed upon\namount --\nQUESTION: Okay. You said circuits start with\nthe 25 percent contract and adjust, rather than the\ncircuits that say start with the lodestar and adjust.\nOkay. And the statute says may. And now why should we do\nwhat you want rather than letting the Ninth Circuit free\nto do it the way it wants?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: I believe, Justice Breyer, that\nthere could be possible, you could allow different\ncircuits to do things in different ways, but the interest\nis in uniform federal law. I believe that the method, the\ntraditional method of determining contingent fee is best\nserved, best serves the purpose of the act. Hence the\nlodestar calculation is generally an expensive,\ntime-consuming endeavor best suited to complex litigation.\nSocial Security cases only take generally 30, 40 or 50\nhours to accomplish.\nIf attorney fee litigation using, trying to\nproof up the Hensley hourly rate is required, then\nattorneys will have to spend five, maybe 10, in this case\nmuch more hours trying to collect a compensatory fee.\nQUESTION: Mr. Schnaufer, can I ask you this\nquestion? As I understand it, 406(a)provides that for\nrepresentation before the agency, the agency shall\nprescribe a maximum fee. Is -- is -- am I correct in\nthat.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: So the agency sets a fee and it\ndoesn't matter what the parties have agreed to before the\nagency. They can agree to whatever they like. The agency\nsays this is the maximum fee. Why would Congress in B\nadopt a totally different regime for representation before\nthe courts? As a, you know, before the agency, your\nagreement with your lawyer doesn't make any difference,\nbut before the courts basically what governs is your\nagreement with the lawyer. I don't know why they would do\nthat?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Scalia, I believe that\nthe statute does not say. That the statute does not\nrequire the agency to ignore an agreement between a\nplaintiff or a claimant and his or her attorney when\ndetermining a fee for administrative work. In fact, if\nyou take a look at the regulations --\nQUESTION: Well, it requires them to ignore it\nif it goes beyond what the agency determines is the\nmaximum amount that ought to be charged.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Scalia. In that\nway 406(b) and 406(a) are the same. To the extent that\nany agreement between an attorney and the Social Security\nclaimant is inconsistent with the statute provision that\nagreement is void. The long-standing provision --\nQUESTION: What about the provision at the\nadministrative level that does refer to an agreement?\nThis is, what is it, (a)(2), an agreement --\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes.\nQUESTION: It controls with a cap of $4,000 at\nthe agency level.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nstatute there is elucidative of Congress' acknowledgment\nand lass the agency's acknowledgment of the capacity of\nSocial Security claimants to contract with their attorneys\nfor representation in federal court. We are not asking\nspecifically for the court to adopt the presumption, the\nconclusive presumption in 406(a)(2), instead, we maintain\nthat the attorney has the ability, has the burden as the\nfee applicant to establish the reasonableness of the fee.\nThat is somewhat different than the more lenient rules of\n406(a)(2).\nQUESTION: May I ask, just a question of what\nthis fee is composed of. Say the claimant loses at all\nthree levels of the administrator, the administrative\nlevel, then wins in court. Do the hours before the agency\ncount and then would they be computed differently because\nthe 406(a) --\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Ginsburg, it depends on\nwhether or not the claimant was represented during the\nadministrative proceedings. If the claimant was\nrepresented during the administrative proceedings, then\nthe claimant's attorney can apply to the agency for\ncompensation for their services after the --\nQUESTION: After winning in court, so they\nwould be completely different.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. They are dual\nentitlement. The attorney with seek both 406(b) fees from\nthe court, for the court work, and 406(a) fees from the\nagency for the agency work.\nQUESTION: I believe there is another scheme I\nthink that's more adhered than this Social Security\nscheme. For veterans' benefits purposes, you are probably\nfamiliar with the provision that provides for filing an\nagreement and then if there is, when they reach such an\nagreement, the total fee payable to the attorney may not\nexceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due\nbenefits awarded. That's an express scheme for filing of\nan agreement and the agreement enforceable.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I\nbelieve that Congress does, has addressed specifically on\noccasion when a court, when the court should look to an\nagreement or the agency should look to the agreement to\ndetermine a reasonable fee. However, I believe that in\nthe context of the legal context in 1965, Congress would\nhave understood that a district court determining a\nreasonable fee for representation in court for the --\nwould look first to whether or not there was a contract\nbetween the attorney and the claimant and whether or not\nthe agreement upon amount was reasonable. That would be\nthe method by which the judge would be expected to\nproceed. The judge would not be expected to determine\nindependently a lodestar amount or try to determine a\nreasonable fee. If the fee agreed to between the attorney\nand the client was reasonable, then that fee would be\napproved.\nQUESTION: So you are saying this is a more --\nthis same statute came later, but that essentially, that\nthey operate the same way?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, but with important\ndifferences. The 406(a)(2) administrative fees creates a\npresumption in favor of the reasonableness of the fee. We\nare saying that the attorney has the burden under 406(b)\nto prove the reasonableness of the fee. We are not\nsuggesting that there is any presumption that the fee\nrequested or that 25 percent is a reasonable fee. The\nattorney has to prove that the reasonable fee is the\nagreed upon fee. Of course, it's important in many cases\nthe attorney will not request the full agreed upon fee but\noftentimes will request much less.\nFor example, in the case of Anderson that this\ncourt denied cert on, the request was not for the full\namount of the contract, but for significantly less. I\nbelieve the attorneys have a strong interest in not\nmaking, requesting inordinately large fees from the court\nbecause one, it would be improper, unreasonable, two, the\ngovernment would be likely to object, and three, the court\nwould be unlikely to award it and so attorneys generally\nare going to make a fee request to the court under 406(b),\nthey are going to be within the raping of reasonableness.\nQUESTION: If you place an objection to the\nlodestar method, you said this becomes a litigation that\nis embarrassingly longer than the litigation over the\nclient itself.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Ginsburg, our objection\nto the lodestar method depends on how you, what you mean\nby the lodestar method. There is a lodestar method using\nthe fee shifting context that is a noncontingent fee.\nThere is also a lodestar method that may allow enhancement\nfor contingency and that would be a fee-shifting context.\nQUESTION: The district court here relied on\nthe bar fees in the Portland area, didn't it, for lawyers\nthat have been practicing a certain amount of time?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The\nhourly rates used were established as noncontingent hourly\nrates however since the attorney services were contingent\non success, an attorney fee awarded at that rate would not\nbe fully compensatory. That when an attorney fee is\ncontingent on success, the attorney fee, a reasonable\nattorney fee should reflect the contingent nature.\nQUESTION: Well, every fee is in a sense\ncontingent on success. I mean, if you lose the lawsuit,\nyou don't charge the same amount as if you win the\nlawsuit, whether or not the fee agreement is contingent?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. Mr. Chief Justice. In\nthis case, the government maintained that $125 for one\nattorney was the appropriate reasonable noncontingent\nhourly rate, however, the government also concedes that\nthe class-based risk of loss in these cases is two out of\nthree. We have set forth agency's own statistics showing\nthat 1/3 of Social Security plaintiffs end up receiving\npast due benefits and so on average, an attorney will\nreceive 1/3 of that noncontingent hourly rate if that\nnoncontingent hourly rate is all the compensation that the\nattorney can obtain.\nQUESTION: Mr. Schnaufer, here's my problem\nwith, with your basic argument, which is look at the\nparties who negotiated a fee in another context, that\nnegotiated fees with what the court begins with. This is\nnot other contexts. All three of the contracts involved\nin this case provided for a fee of 25 percent of the back\nbenefits, right?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: And there is testimony in this case\nthat that is the universal practice, the universal\npractice of all the lawyers that represent these kind of,\nthese kinds of clients.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: And that, that 25 percent of back\nbenefits is the maximum allowed by law?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Now, what, what reason is there to\nbelieve that this is a, you know, an honest evaluation by\nthe two parties of what the, of what the lawyers' services\nare worth? The lawyers are simply going for the absolute\nmaximum that the laws allow. I don't know why we should\n\"approach this\" or why Congress would have approached it\nas cases in which well, you know, after all, the parties\nstruck a deal at the beginning at arm's length and that\nshould be the starting point. This is not that kind of a\nsituation. It is a closed market in which these, these\nplaintiffs take what the bar gives them. That's about\nit.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Scalia, I believe that\nif the statute specified a 5 percent maximum fee or 10\npercent maximum fee, the attorneys would also generally\ncharge, almost universally charge that same five or 10\npercent. It's important to take a look at the 25 percent\ncap on past due benefits in relative context. This is 25\npercent of past due benefits. It's not 25 percent of the\nwhole value of the case. In normal civil litigation an\nattorney recovers not 25 percent of a small part of the\njudgment but the lifetime benefit.\nQUESTION: Sometimes it would be a larger part\nof the benefit. It depends entirely on how long the case\ngoes on. It's entirely fluky, and in all of the cases,\nthe lawyers come in and say 25 percent. That's the max I\ncan get, and that's what I'm going to ask for.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: I think that, Justice Scalia, I\nthink in this case it's useful to look at an example and\nsee what that 25 percent cap actually does. The\ngovernment in this case maintained that the noncontingent\nhourly rate was $125 per attorney. Also the government\ndoes not dispute that the risk of loss is one in three and\nso a fully compensatory hourly rate would multiply that\nhourly rate times a three multiplier for $375 an hour.\nHowever, in these cases, the actual, the 25 percent cap\ncame in, would have been met at $280, $190 and roughly\n$270.\nQUESTION: But your multiplication assumes a\nfictitious market. If I'm an attorney and I'm practicing\nin this area and I know I'm going to win only one out of\nevery three cases, I'm going to tell the judge my hourly\nrate in order to make a decent level in this part of the\nlaw and this special is X dollars an hour, $150 an hour.\nI have to get that. And I take it the trial judge would\nsay yes, that's right, $150 an hour is the prevailing\nrate. That's what you get.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Kennedy, I believe the\nhourly --\nQUESTION: You, you, you made the assumption of\na, of a fictitious market.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Kennedy, I believe that\nthe government concedes that there is a preloss in a\ntypical Title II case and also the government's position\nwas that the appropriate noncontingent win, lose or draw\nhourly rate was $125 for one of these attorneys.\nTherefore, under the government scheme, paying $125 an\nhour to an attorney for services will only mean that the\nonly grosses only $44, roughly, roughly a third of that\namount. And so the way the government is counting, the\nestablishing of the hourly rate at $125, admitting to the\nclass based risk of loss as one of not contesting that,\ncan you see that the attorney's recovery is actually much\nlower than that noncontingent hourly rate, given the --\nQUESTION: Well, it will be --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a question I have\nbeen trying to get in for a while here. What would you,\nwhat would your reaction be to a rule that says the\ndistrict judges shall require the applicant for a fee to\none, file any contract he has, two, file a statement of\nhis hours, three, file his normal rate that he normally\ncharges and based on the district judge's knowledge of the\nproceedings, he shall set a reasonable fee?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Justice Stevens, I believe that\nthat would accomplish the goal readily, a local district\ncourt could adopt such a rule which would be consistent in\n406(b). I think that the court should also at the same\ntime consider whether or not there is any offsetting award\nunder the Equal Access Justice Act. Also, whether or not\nthere is any fee, fee liability under 406(a).\nQUESTION: Well, the district court here\nexpressed, perhaps it was a magistrate judge, expressed\nsome skepticism as to the number of hours, I think, put in\non one of these cases.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthat the district court judge disputed whether there was\nany special expertise involved. The government did not\ncontest that all the hours in these cases were reasonably\nspent, the 25 hours, the 39 and the 52 hours.\nQUESTION: Well, the fact the government didn't\ncontest it doesn't mean that perhaps we shouldn't pay some\nattention to the view of the district judge.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: The district court judge did\naward the number of hours requested. The district court\njudge did not reduce the hours at all in terms of the\nhours. I'd like to take the rest --\nQUESTION: Why should we consider the separate\nfee under the equal access to justice act? A reasonable\nfee is a reasonable fee. Why does it matter that some\nmoney may be forthcoming from a different source to pay\nfor it?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: The statute concerns how much\nthe client will actually end up paying his or her\nattorneys that the Equal Access Justice Act --\nQUESTION: And it says that they should pay a\nreasonable amount.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: All right. Yes. A reasonable\namount. And for example, the out-of-pocket attorneys fees\nin this case with the EAJA offset was 29,675 for all three\nclaimants who received $114,000 in back benefits. And so\nin that context I believe that the attorney fees, the\njudge should consider the equal access to justice act\nbecause how much the claimant pays is very important.\nQUESTION: How does it work under the\nfee-shifting --\nQUESTION: The equal access to justice fee is\nfor the benefit of the lawyer, rather than the client.\nMR. SCHNAUFER: The EAJA itself, the offset\nprovision states that the attorney should keep the larger\nof the 406(b) and the EAJA fee so the statute itself\ncontemplates that the attorney is entitled to the larger\nfee.\nQUESTION: In the context of a fee-shifting\nstatute where EAJA applies, the lawyer gets the fees from\nthe Defendant under EAJA. Can the lawyer have an\nagreement with the client that the client is going to pay\nan override above, above what the lawyer gets from the\nDefendant?\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes. We rely quite heavily,\nJustice Ginsburg, on this Court's decision on Venegas vs.\nMitchell, recognizing that an attorney fee paid by a\nclient to his or her own attorney can be in addition to\nthe amount of a fee-shifting statute. A fee-shifting\nstatute such as the EAJA will not provide a fully against\ntore fee in almost all cases. This is particularly true\nsince the EAJA's hourly rate has an artificial cap. It is\nnot the prevailing market rate based upon the attorney's\nservices in the legal community. If I may, I take the --\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Schnaufer. Mr.\nSalmons, we will hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SALMONS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court: For three reasons the Court should use the\nlodestar method to determine and award a reasonable\nattorney's fee under the Social Security Act. First, the\nlodestar method best reflects the plain language and\npurposes of Section 406(b). Second, it is consistent with\nthe strong presumption in favor of the lodestar approach\nannounced in this Court, attorneys' fees cases and third\nit best furthers the statute's directive that the fees\nawarded in each case must be reasonable.\nQUESTION: Does the lodestar method take into\naccount the contingent nature of the recovery?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the lodestar method\npermits district courts to take a number of factors into\naccount in determining the reasonable hourly rate and the\nreasonable fee under this Court's decision in Dague,\nhowever, courts are not permitted to increase what would\notherwise be a reasonable fee based on the mere fact that\nit was contingent.\nQUESTION: Would it be a reasonable fee if it\nincluded in the hourly rate reference to the fact that\nthere is only a 1/3 success rate? As a judge, I want to\npractice in this area. I know the area very well. I win\nonly a third of the time, therefore my hourly rate takes\ninto account the fact that I'm going to win only a third\nof the time and my hourly rate is $200 an hour. Can the\ndistrict judge accept that?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I think under\nDague that would not be permissible. This court in\nDague --\nQUESTION: Then that's a false market the\ndistrict judge is using in order to award the fee. I\ndon't understand that. And, of course, I see the\nconsistency of your position because if you said yes well\nthen I would say well doesn't the contingency fee do the\nsame thing. So I'm -- but -- I'm concerned about how the\ndistrict judge can award in effect just $40 an hour.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think there are at\nleast the three responses to that. First, this Court in\nDague rejected the notion that contingency enhancements\nwere necessary in order to determine a reasonable fee in\nthe context of fee-shifting statutes.\nQUESTION: What in that case, what statute were\nwe interpreting?\nMR. SALMONS: That involved Section 1988, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Yes. Not this one.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Not cases like this where there is a\nlow success rate, and where the language of the statute\nsays a reasonable fee.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I mean, why isn't the court, why\ncan't the court determine it as it wishes, so long as it\nfinds at the end of the day it's reasonable? An hourly\nrate that it enhances somewhat or the risk factor, or even\na contingent fee could be reasonable, as long as it\ndoesn't exceed 25 percent. Doesn't this statutory\nlanguage leave that open?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think the statutory\nlanguage is open to this Court and to courts generally to\nconstrue a standard that best furthers the purposes of the\nact. This Court has long held --\nQUESTION: Do you think the statute requires\nthat one particular method be selected or does it leave it\nup to the judge?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, it certainly leaves\nit up to courts. That's true in fee-shifting statutes as\nwell as with this statute.\nQUESTION: Well I'm not, I'm not sure that\nfee-shifting statutes are necessarily an appropriate\nanalogy here because perhaps there is no reason for\nrequiring a Defendant to pay a lot of money because of an\narrangement between the plaintiff and his attorney was\ncontingent, and the attorney doesn't win many cases. But\nI think if you are talking about an agreement between the\nplaintiff and the client in the actual case, there may be\nmore of a case for it.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think actually to\nthe contrary in the contempt of fee-shifting statutes this\nCourt has long recognized that the purpose of those\nstatutes is merely to encourage lawyers to undertake that\nlitigation, and nevertheless, this Court has said that a\ncontingent enhancement is not necessary to provide that\nextra inducement that a lodestar calculation is adequate\nand appropriate in striking the balance that Congress\nintended when Congress only intends to encourage\nlitigation. In this context, by contrast, Section 406(b)\nis not merely a statute designed to encourage litigation,\nbut is designed to protect Social Security claimants and\ntheir awards of back --\nQUESTION: I can't understand your position\nthat a reasonable fee must be determined without regards\nto the realities of the special practice. I just don't\nunderstand that.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that, that is simply\nnot our position. It is not our position the courts must\nbe blind to the realities of this practice.\nQUESTION: Is one of the realities that you can\nwin only a third of the time?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, those numbers obviously\nvary. Lawyers in this kind of environment are prevailing\nall of the time.\nQUESTION: Let's assume that that is a given in\nthe particular community and in the particular practice.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. I think that\none thing that's important to keep in mind is that\nCongress struck the balance in this statute between\nprotecting claims and encouraging lawyers.\nQUESTION: In the case that I put, can the\njudge or cannot the judge take into account the fact that\nthe attorney is going to win only a third of the time?\nThis is his only practice. This is all he does. He is a\nspecialist.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if what you mean by\ntake into account --\nQUESTION: That the hourly rate --\nMR. SALMONS: That the court can increase the\nhourly rate in order to provide a subsidy from prevailing\nSocial Security claimants to losing Social Security\nclaimants, I think that would be inappropriate under this\nstatute and under this Court's decisions in Dague, which\nalthough it is a different context, I think the difference\nis quite strongly in favor of applying the same rule here.\nQUESTION: It's not a subsidy. What's a\nsubsidy? I mean the obvious, everybody has the same\npoint. If you say they can only learn $40 an hour, the\nSocial Security people won't be represented or they will\npad their hours. Now, I can't believe Congress wanted\nthat. So, so there doesn't seem to be an answer to that,\nand Congress used the word may, so may means may. I mean,\nthat's the simple argument.\nMR. SALMONS: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And it sounds to me so far there is\nno answer.\nMR. SALMONS: The point I was making is that it\ncertainly is available to this Court to set a standard for\ncourts to apply.\nQUESTION: If it's available, why wouldn't we\ndo it?\nMR. SALMONS: That's what I was trying to\naddress, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. SALMONS: I think the reason why this Court\nshould not adopt a rule that would require the shifting of\nbenefits in effect from successful Social Security --\nQUESTION: That's what I asked. What do you\nmean shifting of benefits? It's not a -- a subsidy is\nwhere you take some money and you pay for somebody to do\nsomething. I don't see why you call this a subsidy.\nThat's a conclusion. What they are doing here is they are\ncharging what it costs them to provide service to Smith,\nand it is what it costs because in the absence of this,\nSmith won't get the service. Nor will Jones and Brown,\nthey are apt to lose. But particularly Smith won't.\nMR. SALMONS: But Your Honor, that's not\nnecessarily true. I mean, individual cases, the riskiness\nof individual cases is going to vary widely.\nQUESTION: Smith is paying, Smith is paying for\nthe work done for the two guys who lost.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. That's exactly\nright. And that's the way this Court --\nQUESTION: One way to word that.\nMR. SALMONS: That's the way this Court\naddressed it.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, why shouldn't we look\nat it that way?\nMR. SALMONS: That same analysis --\nQUESTION: But why should we look at it that\nway since Smith is also paying for what it costs to serve\nSmith?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think that the\nreason this Court should view contingency enhancements in\nthis context as inappropriate is because of the purpose of\nthe statute primarily designed to protect the benefits of\nsuccessful Social Security claims.\nQUESTION: Well but the statute itself speaks,\nsets a kept, a contingent fee of no more than 25 percent.\nI mean the statute itself refers to that as a cap.\nMR. SALMONS: The statute has -- that's\ncorrect, Your Honor. And the statute has two provisions.\nOne is that it sets an upper bound of a reasonable fee\nwhich is 25 percent but more precisely\nQUESTION: That does not suggest that there can\nnever be a contingency factor, does it?\nMR. SALMONS: It does not necessarily suggest\nthat, no. What we are talking -- what I think the\nquestion as Justice Breyer posed was more an a policy\nlevel, why should this Court adopt a rule that would allow\nthose kinds of enhancements and I think one of the reasons\nwhy that's inappropriate in this context is because the\npurpose here is not just to encourage lawyers to take\nthese cases, which was the case in the fee-shifting\nstatutes where this Court said enhancements aren't\nnecessary. The purpose here is to protect claimants and\nit would be particularly inappropriate --\nQUESTION: Well, is the purpose to give fair\ncompensation to members of the bar?\nMR. SALMONS: That is, that is a purpose, but I\nwould submit, Your Honor, that in regards to the language\nwe are focusing on of the reasonable fee, that is not the\nprimary purpose. There is a separate provision in 406(b)\nwhere Congress addressed the question of the problem of\nencouraging lawyers to take these lawsuits.\nQUESTION: Suppose you had a good friend and he\nsaid I'm going to go into Social Security work. I, I know\nthe area very well. It's going to be my specialty. I'm\ngoing to win a third of the time. I'm going to in effect\nget $40 an hour. Would you advice him to go into that\npart of the practice?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that would probably\ndepend on what some of his alternatives were. I don't\nmean that in any sort of derogatory way, but it is not the\ncase that lawyers cannot make a sufficient wage under the\nlodestar method. It's important to remember that there\nare at least six circuits who have been applying the\nlodestar method.\nQUESTION: May I ask you in a way what you mean\nby the lodestar method. I know we have talked about it in\na lot of cases, but would it be a satisfactory compliance\nwith the lodestar method in your view of the case if every\njudge said to every lawyer, file your time sheet with me,\nI want to know your hours, I want to know your regular\ncharge, and I want to see the contract you have got, and I\nknow a lot about the case, I'll fix the fee. Would that\nsatisfy your view?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that would certainly\nbe a one way to interpret a statute that I think on the\ntext of the statute there is nothing that would prohibit\nit. I think there are strong reasons why this Court may\nwant to provide some guidance.\nQUESTION: Well, the guidance is --\nMR. SALMONS: For federal rules.\nQUESTION: You should take into account the\nhours, the general charge that he makes and the success in\nthe case and whatever contract he has made and then you\nwould know the case, you decide the reasonable fee. And\nwe don't want to have a 10-month argument under lodestar\nmethod about what the, you know, one of the things we want\nto avoid is protracted litigation in these cases, so we\nwant to simplify it. I think you would agree that's\ndesirable?\nMR. SALMONS: I do agree that's desirable, but\nI think the lodestar method is the best way to could that.\nQUESTION: And I'm just wondering if what I\npropose to be a sufficient compliance with the lodestar\nmethod to satisfy the government?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think it would\nlargely be in compliance with lodestar method, although\nnot under this Court's decision in Dague which has\nprohibited the consideration of contingency enhancements.\nQUESTION: Did that, did that prohibition of\ncontingency enhancements apply in the context such as this\nwhere it was only legally possible to charge when you win?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor, that was not the\ncontext of 1988.\nQUESTION: Might not that make a difference?\nIt's one thing to say well, if you don't, if you don't\ncharge anything for your losing cases, that's your\nproblem. You ought to charge. And we are not going to\nallow you to conduct that practice and make, make this\nplaintiff pay for the, for the two who you lost. But when\nyou are in a different context where the only time you can\nget fees by law is where you win, would we have to pay,\nwould we have to adopt the same rule?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think this Court\nshould adopt the same rule and it's because the reasons\nthis Court adopted the rule that it did in the context of\nfee-shifting statutes was not because there was still some\npossibility that lawyers could negotiate fees even that\nwon on a contingent basis.\nQUESTION: What's the government's position,\nsupposing one of the Social Security lawyers has a very\nwealthy client who feels he is entitled to Social Security\nas a course he is just like everybody else. He hasn't\nbeen paid it, and says to the lawyer, I'll pay you $300 an\nhour if, for all the work you put on this case because I\nam determined to get that Social Security. Do you think\n406(b) prohibits that?\nMR. SALMONS: Um --\nQUESTION: He doesn't want to get it out of the\njudgment at all. He says I'll bill you for it afterwards.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the commissioner does\ninterpret 406(b) to require only contingent fees, that it\nprohibits a lawyer from charging fees when there is no\naward of back benefits.\nQUESTION: A maximum wouldn't make any sense\notherwise. I mean, the maximum is 25 percent of the back\npay award. If there is no back pay award, you can charge\nas much as you like. I mean, that's strange.\nMR. SALMONS: We think that in light of, of the\nterms of 406(b), its purpose is in the structure with,\nwith the provision that would make it in fact a crime to\ncharge more. But the best way to read that is to require\nthat only fees that have been authorized by a court can be\ncharged.\nQUESTION: Has the commission ever issued an\nopinion to that effect?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. There is no\nregulation that simply addresses that. To be honest with\nyou, it is not an issue that has really come up because\nlawyers as the record here again reflects, have a\nuniversal practice of entering into fee agreements that\nsay 25 percent contingency at the statutory maximum and\ntheir contingent fees so it's just not an issue that comes\nup.\nQUESTION: So the statute says all fees are\ncontingent and the government says there can be no\ncontingent fees? That's where we are in this case?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The statute says\nthe relevant language of the statute says the courts will\ndetermine a reasonable fee, and we --\nQUESTION: But all fees are contingent on\nsuccess. In other words, there is some confusion, I\nthink, of what the term contingent fee means. Nobody gets\na fee if they lose. At least the secretaries interpreted\nthe statute as long as I know to say that the only time\nthat the lawyer is going to recover is if the plaintiff\nguess benefits, is that right?\nMR. SALMONS: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Okay. And then the question is\nwhat's, what this provision requires. One just reaction\nthat I had to this picture is well, in tort litigation,\nthe standard is a third of the recovery. And why isn't\nhere, why isn't a quarter of the recovery eminently\nreasonable considering as was pointed out that the\nrecovery comes only out of the past benefits. No --\nnothing out of the future benefits the person is going to\nget. So what is it about the 25 percent of past benefits?\nIt doesn't just make a whole lot of sense instead of\nengaging in what we know from this very case, we'll take\nas much time as the calculation, as the dispute over the\nbenefits themselves. The litigation here over the fees\ntook as long as the litigation over the claimant's right\nto benefits.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, let me if I may\naddress your last point first. That is to say that the\ncommissioner's experience with the lodestar method in the\nnumerous circuits that apply it is not that it is\ndifficult to apply, but keep in mind, Your Honors, that in\nmost of these cases, the lawyers are also seeking EAJA\nfees and so the very same court that's going to consider\nthe 406(b) fee claim has already undertaken a lodestar\nanalysis to determine a reasonable number of hours and\nthen the rate is determined by EAJA, but the\ncommissioner's experience is that the lodestar method is\nnot difficult to apply and in the vast majority of cases,\ncertainly in most circuits, the commissioner doesn't\nobject to most of the fee claims because they are\nreasonable. The courts have determined standards for what\nreasonable rates are in the relevant prevailing markets.\nQUESTION: You mentioned EAJA. One of the\nproblems that I have with that analogy is it works out\nhere that you get EAJA is just about this it. These three\nlawyers got what, what EAJA permitted. And then\nfee-shifting statutes generally you get from the Defendant\nwhat EAJA allows you, but then you can have, you can\nrecover more from your own client. Here it works out that\nEAJA is it and it seems to me something unfair about that.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think the only\nthing unfair in that sense is that Congress here has\ndetermined that the market for legal services in the\nSocial Security context was failing to carry out the\npurposes of the Social Security Act, and that lawyers had\nunequal bargaining power and were charging inordinately\nlarge contingency fees --\nQUESTION: But those were the days you were\ntalking about 50 percent contingent fees so Congress cut\nit back to 25, so why -- what --\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: What -- you just said well, 25 not\nin every case, maybe only work two hours, it would be\nunreasonable, but instead of having the judge and the\nlawyers go through this whole thing, I mean, EAJA is\navailable only if the government's position was not\nsubstantially justified, right? It's not automatic.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. That's correct.\nIt's a standard that course seem to find on a regular\nbasis in these cases, but that is the standard.\nQUESTION: Does the government -- I don't know\nhow it works, but when someone is seeking benefits from\nthe government, government has prevailed all through the\nagency, loses in court, does the government just sort of\nconcede that the government's position was not\nsubstantially justified?\nMR. SALMONS: Not necessarily, Your Honor. I\nthink the government lawyers in each case would look at\nthe prevailing circuit law or, of the jurisdiction, would\nlook at the facts of the case and make the determination.\nIn most of these cases, EAJA fees seem to be awarded and\nthe resolution of those fees doesn't take a lot of time.\nQUESTION: Well, shouldn't there about, you say\nyou look at the law of the particular circuit. I would\nthink that a concept like was the government's position\nsubstantially justified shouldn't be whatever it means in,\nin 12 different appellate courts.\nMR. SALMONS: My point, Your Honor, is just one\nof the things I think that's keeping, is important to keep\nin mind in these cases is that they, by their nature, tend\nto be very routine and so both in terms of awarding EAJA\nfees and in terms of awarding 406(b) fees, it is not very\ndifficult for courts to develop practices in these cases\nthat, that result in a very expedited process, and that in\nfact, that is, that is the way the lodestar method is\napplied and I, and it seems to me, Your Honors, that the\nalternative that's being proposed would largely frustrate\nthe purpose that Justice Stevens was identifying of the\nneed for some sort of expedited procedures here. They\npoint to four additional factors that aren't lodestar\nfactors that they think courts should take into account.\nSome of the contingency circuits who have\nadopted some modified contingency rule have added\nadditional factors, including requiring courts to ask\nwhether the claimants had been notified that there were\nother options other than the 25 percent contingent fee\nwhich under the facts of this case we were told the\nlawyers would never do.\nQUESTION: Does the government have any\nstatistics as to how often an award of attorneys fees by a\ndistrict judge is appealed to the Court of Appeals?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that is, in the\ncontext of 406(b) cases?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: There are no -- the agency does\nnot specifically keep statistics on that, although I did\ndiscuss that with the relevant agency personnel and was\ninformed that in fact the agency very rarely seeks an\nappeal unless the case involves some broader legal\nprinciple that the agency determines is important to\nlitigation.\nQUESTION: How about the attorney?\nMR. SALMONS: I do not have any figures on\nthat, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Salmons, another question of\nstatistics. We have had the statistic that only one out\nof three cases is successful. And I take it you have not\nchallenged that. That's one of the arguments that there\nis something that is really outrageous practice going on\nand there is a need to enhance for that contingency. What\nI want to ask is are there any, is there any evidence,\nstatistical or otherwise, to explain why the rate is only\none win out of three cases?\nOne reason might be that, or one description\nmight be that virtually all lawyers who take these cases\nin fact have the experience of losing two for every one.\nBut another explanation might be that lawyers who can tell\nthe difference between a good case and a bad case win at a\nvery high rate, and that a lot of young lawyers who don't\nhave access to many clients are willing to take long shots\nand that when you average those two together, you bet the\none win out of three cases.\nDo we know, do we know which possible\ndescription is correct or whether there is some third\ndescription that explains the one in three?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any\nstatistical or other information that's directly on point,\nalthough I could think it is important to keep in mind\nthat the standards of review among other things have a lot\nto do with the outcome of these cases, and that, and that\nthe general statistics that the courts provide through,\nfor example, the federal judiciary home page that tracks\ndifferent types of cases in different circuits, for\nexample, shows that there has been dramatic increases in\nthe number of Title II disability lawsuits that are filed\ninitially in district courts between the period of 1990 to\n2000. In fact, that they have tripled.\nQUESTION: Does that have anything to do with\nwhat the rate is because these are all cases that lost at\nthe administrative level, right?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Is there any, any showing that maybe\nin the prior period, there were more cases winning at the\nadministrative level, therefore fewer getting into the\ncourt?\nMR. SALMONS: Not that I have seen. In fact,\nYour Honor, the numbers that I have seen suggest that the\npercentage of cases that win before the agency has been\nrelatively consistent.\nQUESTION: I don't understand the point were\nyou driving at. So what, so they tripled in 10 years, you\nknow, and the ice cap melted.\nMR. SALMONS: I surely don't want to overstate\nit.\nQUESTION: I don't understand what you were\ndriving at. What was the point that you were making?\nMR. SALMONS: The point I was attempting to make,\nYour Honor --\nQUESTION: Is this the result of those, of\nthose jurisdictions that have allowed contingency to be\nconsidered?\nMR. SALMONS: No. Not at all. Your Honor.\nThe point I was trying to make is that there aren't any\nhard statistics that show how the different legal rules\nhave having an effect on litigants in this context, but\nthe general --\nQUESTION: And likewise, I take it there are no\nstatistics on how the different compensation approaches\nare having an effect?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. And that's,\nthat's the point I was trying to make, Your Honor. That\nall that we can tell is that one, the commissioner has not\nbeen flooded with complaints in the circuits that applied\nthe lodestar, which is the dominant method and has been\nfor over 10 years.\nQUESTION: Do you have any flooded in the other\njurisdictions?\nMR. SALMONS: No. My point is that there are,\nthere are, there is no reason to think that the rules are\nhaving that dramatic of an effect on the availability of\ncounsel.\nQUESTION: Then why don't we leave it alone?\nLet the judge do it?\nMR. SALMONS: That is certainly an option that\nis before this Court. The government's position is that\nif the Court is going to address the issue of what\nstandards should be applied, that the best way for this\nCourt to do it is to specify that the lodestar method is\nthe best method, and that includes --\nQUESTION: But that is a pretty big swing if\nyou say if the judge can go up to 25 percent if that's\nreasonable, here what was the percent, the lodestar\npercent, the lodestar yielded what percent of the past two\nbenefits in these cases?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I don't have that\nfigure. I can tell you that in terms of hourly rates, for\nexample, I --\nQUESTION: Wasn't it about half of what the\ncontingency would have been?\nQUESTION: Even less, I think.\nMR. SALMONS: It varied in the, in the cases.\nQUESTION: I think it was under 10 percent.\nMR. SALMONS: I think one way to sort of try\nand track that is that what the claimants lawyers in these\ncases did was because they recognized they were in a\nlodestar circuit, they had, they kept the same number of\nreasonable hours they would use for their EAJA fees which\nthe government did not contest and then they just divided\nthat by the 25 percent figure and came up with an hourly\nrate. So the hourly rates they sought in these cases\nranged from around $180 an hour to nearly $300 an hour.\nQUESTION: But those were chopped down by the\njudge.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Because they were not supposed to,\nat least this Court, the Court here did it. It took out\nfollowing this Court's precedent any override for risk of\nnonsuccess.\nMR. SALMONS: That's right, Your Honor. The\nNinth Circuit has --\nQUESTION: So I'm not talking about the rates\nthat the lawyers asked for, I'm talking about the rates\nthat they got. My concern is this. If you just say well\njudge, look at the agreement. Look at the hourly rate.\nYou can get swings from one court saying as I think was\ntrue here, 7.8 percent to another judge saying in that\nvery same case 25 percent. That's why I think you have to\nhave a little more control, a little more uniformity.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, let me make two\npoints very quickly. One is that when Congress enacted\nthis statute, it recognized not only that lawyers were\ncharging an inordinately large percentage in terms of\ntheir contingency fees, but there was an inherent problem\nwith contingency fees because in this context they do not\ntrack the value, a reasonable value of legal services.\nThey turn unnecessarily on factors such as the number of\ndependents and the amount of delay that it takes in order\nto get the benefits over which time the benefits continued\nto accrue which just has no bearing whatsoever on the\namount, the value of the legal services provider.\nQUESTION: Are you recommending that we say let\nthe judge do it, no matter what? Is that the government's\nposition? I thought the government was coming in with a\npretty stiff position that it's the lodestar method\nperiod.\nMR. SALMONS: That is the government's\nposition, Your Honor. We think that the lodestar method.\nLet me just see if I can, and be very clear.\nQUESTION: Your position is that we do not want\nto subsidize bad suits?\nMR. SALMONS: Yes. That is exactly right.\nQUESTION: It is not in the best interests of\nanybody, the country or anybody else, to encourage lawyers\nto bring bad suits and then get paid for it when they win\na good suit, right?\nQUESTION: I was wondering if you had spent a\nlot of time --\nQUESTION: This is certainly a way to get\nlawyers in the good suits.\nMR. SALMONS: But, Your Honor, there is no,\nthere is no evidence of that. And in fact the evidence\nthat it does exist is to the contrary. There are six\ncircuits that have been employing the lodestar method for,\nfor decades without any evidence that there is a failure\nof lawyers who want to take these cases. The lawyers in\nthese cases submitted affidavits that said we, we practice\nregularly in federal courts in Title II cases and we have\nbeen doing it for years and years and that's in the\ncontext of lodestar statutes.\nQUESTION: Why not make it run the same way the\nveterans' benefits do? I mean, after all, it's a similar\nkind of set up. You claim that if it's at the agency, you\nlose, you come to court, and there it's the agreement is\n20 percent, so it's, but that seems to be working fine,\nright? Where the judge gives the 20 percent.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that would certainly\nbe an alternative availability to Congress. The\ndifference would be the statutory language would prohibit\nthis Court from adopting a rule that would look primarily\nto the fee contracts. Congress knows how to write that\nkind of statute when it wants to. It did so in 406(a)(2).\nIt has not done so here. Another point I would like to\nmake, Your Honor, is that, is that these cases are, as\nboth sides seem to agree, are somewhat unique in that they\ngenerally require a very low number of hours. They don't\nrequire the same kinds of risk undertaken by the lawyers\nas other contingent fee cases do.\nQUESTION: Well, if that's so then the judge in\nall the circuits that follow the contingent method would\nreduce the award. I mean, in one way you are going to\nstart with the lodestar enhance. In the other way you are\ngoing to start with the contingent fee reduce it. I guess\nthe simpler is the contingent fee reduce it. I think\nfrankly you don't have to go into the hours.\nMR. SALMONS: I disagree, Your Honor, because\nof the court's experience, the lodestar method, I think\nthat's the most efficient way for courts to determine the\nfee.\nQUESTION: Beyond the record, do you have any\nstatistics on how often contingent fees are reduced in the\ncontingency circuits?\nMR. SALMONS: I do not, Your Honor. I do not.\nOne other thing that I think --\nQUESTION: Do you have any sort of egregious\nexamples where there was a lot of delay in those circuits\njust to build up the recovery? Has that turned out to be\na problem for the agency anywhere?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the agency has not\nexperienced any particular problem under either of these\nstandards. We do think that the lodestar method as this\nCourt announced it in Dague is the best way to effectuate\nCongress' intent under the purposes of this statute. I\nthink it's important to keep in mind that Congress has\nalready provided a mechanism to ensure adequate counsel\nhere, and that is the payment out of the back benefit\nawards directly to the lawyer. That's different than in\nother contingent fee contexts.\nSo that Congress was concerned with the need to\nencourage counsel and it provided a provision to do that.\nIt struck the balance, and then it requires the courts to\ndetermine the reasonable fee in each case based on a fair\nvalue of the legal services provided and this Court has\nlong held that there is a strong presumption that when\nCongress says courts determine a reasonable fee, Congress\nmeans the lodestar method.\nIf the lodestar method --\nQUESTION: That wasn't even established until\nHensley against -- whatever it is. The lodestar got\nsettled around in the circuits in the 1980s. Social\nSecurity claims have been going on a long time. Wasn't it\nstandard before, but it was contingent?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, courts used a variety\nof standards before as they did under other fee statutes.\nThe fact that the lodestar method wasn't fully developed\ndidn't prevent this Court from adopting it under the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, for example, but prior to the adoption\nof the lodestar method, it's not the case the courts were\nroutinely deferring to the fee contracts.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr.\nSchnaufer, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAUFER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SCHNAUFER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nbelieve that the government's position is a bold new\nposition. The government has not previously advanced\nexcept for in its brief that all circuits are wrong, that\neven the lodestar jurisdictions are wrong. That no one\ncan, no enhancements for contingencies can ever be\npermitted and so the agency cannot rely on the experience\nin the circuit lodestar to say that this method is the\npreferable method.\nClaimants need attorneys. In these cases the\ngovernment conceded that the agency's position, underlying\nagency position was not substantially justified without\nattorneys whose claimants most likely would never receive\nthe benefits that they were due. Justice Stevens, you\nasked about possibly about the EAJA of lodestar. There\nare many reasons why the EAJA, Equal Access Justice Act is\nnot the lodestar amount. The EAJA has an artificial\nhourly rate capped below the prevailing market rate. The\nEAJA also often represents a settlement of the parties for\nthe risk of litigating the substantial justification\nissue. And so we cannot rely, just because there is an\nEqual Access Justice Act award, there is not in the case\nalready a lodestar amount.\nThen I guess I think it allows this Court to\ndistinguish easily Dague. Dague should not be applied\noutside of the fee-shifting context because as its\nrequest, a plaintiff should be able to pay his or her own\nattorney to take into account the risk of loss. Justice\nO'Connor, I think was asking whether or not contingency\ncould be taken into account by a district court in\ndetermining the fee. I believe that if this Court can\ndirect that the lodestar method be adopted to enhance for\ncontingency reflecting the necessary contingent nature of\nthe claim or the court can use a contingent fee method,\nthere again looking at the contingent nature of the fee,\nregardless of which way the court goes, the court allows\nmore than one method. I brief that the contingent nature\nof Social Security cases should be taken into account.\nThe government describes dependence. The\ngovernment objects that attorney fee awards would be\narbitrarily different based upon the number of dependents.\nThe government lost that issue in Hopkins vs. Cohen in\n1968. This Court held in Hopkins the number -- thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
