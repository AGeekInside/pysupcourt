        "content": "[10:16 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Samson versus California.\nMr. Long.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe search in this case was not based on\nindividualized suspicion, and no other adequate\nsafeguards limited the police officer's discretion to\nsearch Petitioner. For this reason, the search, which\nwould not be permitted by virtually any other State or\nby the Federal Government, was unreasonable.\nThe Court has reaffirmed many times that the\nFourth Amendment does not permit the individual officer\nin the field to exercise unconstrained discretion to\nsearch. The Court has said that the Fourth Amendment\nis primarily directed at the evil -- it was primarily\ndirected at the evil of general warrants and writs of\nassistance, and the evil of general warrants and writs\nof assistance was that they gave individual officers\nblanket authority to search where they pleased and\nplaced the liberty of every man in the hands of every\npetty officer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to\nliberty, as it -- it's not disputed, is it, that your\nclient could have had his parole revoked even though\nthe search was suspicionless? So, what we're talking about\nthe difference between revocation of parole, on the one\nhand, and a separate criminal offense. Is that right?\nMR. LONG: Well, a parolee has conditional\nliberty. But, at the time of this search, Mr. Samson\nwas on parole, there was no suspicion of any wrongdoing\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that\nevidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis\nto revoke parole.\nMR. LONG: Oh, well, the Court held, in the\nScott case, that the exclusionary rule does not apply\nat parole revocation hearings. So, if there is an\nunreasonable search of a parolee that violates the\nFourth Amendment, the evidence could not be admitted at\na criminal trial, but it could be admitted at a parole\nrevocation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the -- what the -- the\nconsequence here is whether --\nMR. LONG: I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- he will have his parole\nrevoked --\nMR. LONG: I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or he will have a\nseparate criminal offense.\nMR. LONG: I understand your question. In\nCalifornia, Justice Ginsburg, a nonviolent drug\noffense, the possession of a small amount of an illegal\nsubstance, is not a basis for revocation of parole. It\nis not possible to revoke parole in California for this\noffense. So, parole revocation would not have been a\npossibility here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nsuppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, but\nlet me ask you this, because I -- her question suggests\nthis, to me at least. Suppose the parole officer said,\n\"Now, look, I'm going to search you. If you don't\nconsent, then I'm going to revoke your parole.\"\nMR. LONG: Well, this, of course, was a\npolice officer, not a parole officer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I --\nMR. LONG: But if --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- my question was\na parole officer, and I'll get to police officer next.\nMR. LONG: All right. I think if a parole\nofficer said, \"You must consent to this search\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When you see the --\nMR. LONG: -- \"this particular search\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- person on the street, et\ncetera, et cetera.\nMR. LONG: \"And, if you don't, I'll revoke\nyour\" -- I mean, the consent is not, in this case,\nfirst. I mean, California has said, the Supreme Court\nhas said, parole, in the parole search condition, is\nimposed as a matter of law. Your hypothetical poses a\nquestion of, could there be knowing and voluntary\nconsent to a search if the consequence of refusing is\nrevocation of parole? I would argue, in that\nsituation, that the consequences of refusal are so dire\nthat, effectively, the parolee would have no real\nchoice but to consent. So, it would be, in a sense, a\ncoerced consent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why are they dire? I mean,\nhe's just back in the situation he would have been in,\ndid he not comply with the conditions of his parole. I\ndon't see that that's dire. He has a choice. He can\nstay in prison and --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and suffer the reduction\nof privacy there, which is much, much greater than\nbeing subjected to -- I mean, he -- he cannot even go\nto the toilet in privacy. Or he can go out on parole,\nsubject to the condition that --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he --\nMR. LONG: I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- he can --\nMR. LONG: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- be searched.\nMR. LONG: I have two answers to that,\nJustice Scalia. I mean, first, in California, you\nfinish your prison sentence, and then parole is a\nseparate period that happens. The California Supreme\nCourt said, in People v. Guzman and other cases, parole\nis not a part of the sentence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's --\nMR. LONG: -- in California.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but it's also clear from\nthe California statute that it is not a right, that\nit's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole\nin exchange -- in exchange for agreeing to the\nconditions, one of which is that you can be searched.\nMR. LONG: Well, it's -- in California, every\ninmate gets parole. It's a matter of law. It's not a\nprivilege -- in Morrissey against Brewer. The Court --\nin other cases, the Court rejected the rights privilege\ndistinction anyway.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: California statute says it's\na privilege, doesn't it?\nMR. LONG: Yes, in section 3067.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does.\nMR. LONG: But it is -- it is also a --\nsection 3000 of the California penal code says every\nprisoner gets parole. It is imposed on the prisoner as\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the --\nMR. LONG: -- a matter of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- prisoner -- oh, I thought\nthat he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do,\nif --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if they decide that they\ndon't want to be subjected to searches.\nMR. LONG: The California Supreme Court has\nheld, in People v. Reyes, and in other cases cited in\nour brief, that, in California, parole is not a matter\nof choice, it is imposed as a matter of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- and you mean people\nare put out on the street when -- kicking and screaming\nwhen they say, \"No, I want to stay in jail. I don't\nwant to be\" --\nMR. LONG: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"searched. I would\nrather stay in jail\"? And --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they are dragged out --\nMR. LONG: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- into the street. Is that\nwhat happens?\nMR. LONG: That is what the California\nSupreme Court has said.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I --\nMR. LONG: And what the statutes say is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I don't think so.\nMR. LONG: That -- the statutes say that\nparole is a -- is a transitional period, and that every\ninmate should undergo a period of parole.\nBut coming back to your earlier question, the\nCourt has said that the condition of a parolee is very\ndifferent from the condition of a prisoner. The Court\nsaid that in Morrissey against Brewer. And the Court\nsaid, in Griffin, as to probationers, that while the\nFourth Amendment rights of probationers -- and so,\nparolees, too, we concede -- are reduced, there are --\nthe State can go too far. And if the State exceeds --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --\nMR. LONG: -- the permissible limits, it's a\nviolation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- their condition is\nvery different, in a broad range of areas. They -- you\ngive up First Amendment rights. For example, it's\ntypical to have a condition of parole that you don't\nconsort with known criminals or gang members. You --\noften it says you must refrain from alcohol. Sometimes\nthey say you can't go near particular places, if they\nthink that's going to tempt you to return to a life of\ncrime. Those are all First Amendment rights that are\nsacrificed while you're on parole. Why is this any\ndifferent?\nMR. LONG: Well, there are many rights that\nare sacrificed. What the Court has said about the\nFourth Amendment rights is, because parolees have\nconditional liberty, they will have a reduced, but not\neliminated, Fourth Amendment protection --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a drug --\nwhat if you're convicted of a drug offense, you're on\nparole, and one of the conditions is, every week you\nhave to go in for a drug test?\nMR. LONG: Well, that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you --\nMR. LONG: -- that would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you -- is that\nacceptable?\nMR. LONG: That would be different in several\nrespects, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, there would\nnot be discretion. You wouldn't have the individual\nofficer deciding --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be a\nFourth Amendment right that you would be giving up --\nMR. LONG: Yes. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that you would\notherwise have if you weren't on parole.\nMR. LONG: And I want to be clear, we are not\n-- we're arguing there is a broad spectrum of searches\nthat States can undertake of parolees, and I'm, by no\nmeans, arguing today that all of them, or even most of\nthem, are unconstitutional. This is a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What would you say about a\ncondition that you must -- not a regular drug test --\nyou just have to submit yourself to a drug test\nwhenever a police officer asks you to?\nMR. LONG: Well, you know, that would be much\nnarrower, because it would simply be a drug test. I\nthink it would have the problems of -- the officer\nwould have complete discretion. If it were like the\nCalifornia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's -- I\nmean, the point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it would\nvalid? That's what I was asking you.\nMR. LONG: I think, because that's a much\nnarrower test, that that could pass muster if -- but I\nwould think there really ought to be some guidance to\nthe officer. I think our ultimate submission today is\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so that a --\nMR. LONG: -- this is so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so that a burglar could\nbe searched for burglar tools --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but not for drugs? And\nthe drug addict can be searched for drugs, and not\nburglar tools?\nMR. LONG: If it were -- if it were tied to\nthe crime that the parolee has committed, you know,\nthat would give it some limitation. This is a\ncompletely unlimited search, for anything, any crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice Stevens's\nquestion highlights the point that you criticize about:\nthe randomness of it is often a critical element. I\nsuppose it makes much more sense to say you're subject\nto a random drug test than that you have to come in at\na scheduled time, when you -- presumably, you could\nrefrain from using drugs prior to the test. And, to\nsome extent, it's the same, even if you're not talking\nabout a drug test.\nMR. LONG: Well, in all --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The search is only\ngoing to be effective if it's not announced or --\nMR. LONG: Well, in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- scheduled.\nMR. LONG: -- and in this Court's\nsuspicionless search cases, you can have a random test\nwhere you draw names at random. There's some other\nprocess that doesn't leave it up to each individual\nofficer to decide who gets the drug test or which car\nto stop to check the driver's license and registration.\nWhat the Court has consistently held is really at the\ncore of the Fourth Amendment is this notion of: the\nindividual officer in the field has complete discretion\nto decide, \"Do I search this person? Do I not? What's\nthe scope of the search? What do\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying --\nMR. LONG: -- \"I search for?\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on the difference\nbetween -- you said \"officer in the field.\" Would this\nbe okay if it had been his parole officer?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The parole officer was\nwalking along the street, saw this guy, and said, \"I'm\ngoing to search you.\"\nMR. LONG: I think it's a very different set\nof circumstances if we have a parole officer. This\nCourt has said, at least twice, in Griffin and in\nScott, that a parole officer has a different function.\nThey are not in an adversarial, or a purely\nadversarial, relationship. They often think of the\nparolee or the probationer as a client. They're trying\nto see that the person succeeds. In some sense, the\nparole officer fails when the parolee goes back to\nprison. The parole -- the parole officer can act on\ntheir entire knowledge and experience with the client,\nor the parolee. So, all of that makes a difference.\nAnd the Court has noted that several times.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When he's in prison, is\nthere any problem about the prison guards intruding\nupon his privacy, willy-nilly, whenever they choose?\nMR. LONG: The -- as I understand the Court's\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, walking --\nMR. LONG: -- holding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by his cell, which is\nalways opened, and checking in on him to see what's --\nwhat he's doing.\nMR. LONG: As I understand the Court's\nholding in Hudson against Palmer, the Fourth Amendment\ndoes not apply in a prison cell. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, he's better off on\nparole than -- well, at least no worse off on parole\nthan he would be when he was in prison.\nMR. LONG: But, Your Honor, that's not the\nway this Court has analyzed the Fourth Amendment\nissues. It's a different situation. It is conditional\nliberty. It's the -- that sort of active grace theory,\nor right, privilege, distinction, or greater power\nincludes the lesser, all those arguments have been\nrejected, in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are --\nMR. LONG: -- Morrissey against Brewer, and\nGagnon --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nMR. LONG: -- against Scarpelli.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by me. No, please.\nMR. LONG: It's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the\npragmatic argument that seems to cut through all of your\nobjections? The pragmatic argument is both in favor\nof complete discretion and of suspicionless search,\nthat the in terrorem effect of knowing that these\nsearches can occur at any moment, in fact, discourages\nrecidivism.\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's your response to\nthat?\nMR. LONG: -- I have a pragmatic argument,\nand then I have an argument just based on the Fourth\nAmendment. Pragmatically, no other State, as far as we\ncan tell, and not the Federal Government, authorizes\nthis kind of search; that is, blanket suspicionless\ndiscretionary searches by police officers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from --\nMR. LONG: So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from the lack of\npopularity of the State's view --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do we have -- do we have\nany empirical evidence that bears on the in terrorem\nargument?\nMR. LONG: The -- well, the empirical\nevidence is that all the other States don't seem to be\nhaving a harder time --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --\nMR. LONG: -- with recidivism.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I realize that. But,\nbeyond that, do we have any empirical evidence, one way\nor the other?\nMR. LONG: Well, the California -- I think\nthat's a pretty powerful demonstration, but we do have,\nbeyond that, empirically, California was with all the\nother States until the People against Reyes decision.\nNow they've moved to suspicionless searches. They seem\nto have about the same rate of recidivism --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it --\nMR. LONG: -- as they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the answer is --\nMR. LONG: -- did before.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- we don't have any\nempirical evidence, one way or the other, apart from\nthe fact that California stands out in its system. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. LONG: Well, I -- I'm -- think I'm\noffering you evidence that counts as empirical in my\nmind, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --\nMR. LONG: -- apparently it's not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I know it, but I've said,\nabout three times, that I want to get beyond the\npeculiar position of California to any other empirical\nevidence that cuts for you or against you. And I take\nit there really isn't --\nMR. LONG: Well, there -- we have a footnote.\nThere is a brief submitted by a Stanford law\nprofessor, and we have at least a footnote in our\nbrief. There is some social science research that\nsuggests that this more intensive supervision is really\nnot effective, if you look at broad numbers. I mean, I\nthink you will catch some additional people. I mean,\nit happened in this case. But if you step back and\nlook at the overall effects, it's not -- it's not\nparticularly helpful --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, if we're going to catch\nsome additional people, is that not sufficient? That\nis, why is it unreasonable, say, not for law\nprofessors, but business school professors, management\nconsultants, to say, \"You have a lot of prisoners in\nCalifornia, hundreds of thousands -- I don't know,\nmaybe more than 100,000 -- and we'll tell the\nLegislature that they can cut the terms, save money,\nrelease them early, but we want to have management\nchecks. And the management checks are, you might be\nsearched at any time. And we catch a few. And that's\nhelpful.\" Now, if the --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- State decides that,\nwhat's unreasonable about it? \"They're\" --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- \"letting the people out\nearlier than they otherwise would\" --\nMR. LONG: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- says the Legislature.\nMR. LONG: Because, Justice Breyer, it has to\nbe a balancing analysis, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's on the other\nside? The other side --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is, you'd rather not have\npolicemen search you, but your alternative is going to\nbe in jail.\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, the other side is a\nsearch condition that says you have -- you could be\nsearched at any time, any place, by any police officer\nfor evidence of any crime, is a breathtakingly broad\ninvasion of privacy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, that's how\nit happens when he's in prison.\nMR. LONG: Well, but he has come out of\nprison. The State has seen fit to release him on\nparole into society. He has conditional liberty. And\nthe Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there is a\nbreathtakingly high probability that he is committing a\ncrime. The statistics cited in the Government's brief\nsay that in an April 2001 report prepared by the\nCalifornia Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 68\npercent of adult parolees are returned to prison -- 68\npercent; 55 percent, for a parole violation; and 13\npercent for the commission of a new felony offense. I\nmean, it seems to me a breathtaking statistic like that\nmay call for breathtaking --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- measures to try to police\nthe matter closely.\nMR. LONG: It is a very serious problem. We\ndon't want to minimize it. I mean, it is a fact that\nmany -- many parolees -- and this is true especially in\nCalifornia -- end up being returned for technical\nviolations, like not showing up to meetings with parole\nofficers. Some of the offenses are not as serious as\nothers. But it is a very serious problem. We\nrecognize that. But what the Court has said is that\nthe gravity of the problem cannot justify any means.\nThere has to be a balancing of the invasion of privacy\nagainst the State's need to undertake this.\nAnd coming back to my second answer to the\nquestion you asked several minutes ago, Justice Scalia,\nI mean, ultimately this search is a -- it's a general\nwarrant. It's a writ of assistance. It's limited to\nparolees, but if the Court is going to stand by what it\nhas said in Griffin and other cases, that their\nparolees and probationers have some modicum of Fourth\nAmendment rights -- reduced, we recognize that -- this\nis -- this is the core of what the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the --\nMR. LONG: -- framers of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- California --\nMR. LONG: -- the Fourth Amendment\nprohibited.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The California\nSupreme Court said that the Fourth Amendment applied to\nthese searches, but it only protected in a limited way,\nalong the same lines as we said in Griffin. And the\nstandard they applied was, it protected against\narbitrary or harassing or capricious searches --\nMR. LONG: Yes, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which seems to go\nto your argument, which is centered around the\nunbridled discretion of the officer. And the\nCalifornia Supreme Court is saying it's not unbridled.\nMR. LONG: That is their answer to my\nargument, and I want to be very clear about \"arbitrary,\ncapricious, and harassing.\" That's the California\nSupreme Court's standard. So, of course, they get to\ndefine it. And they have not defined it the way this\nCourt perhaps would define \"arbitrary.\" It's not\narbitrary, capricious, or harassing if it has a\npermissible law enforcement purpose. So, as long as\nthe officer says, \"Well, I don't have any reason to\nthink there's evidence of any crime here, but that's\nwhat I'm looking for. Perhaps there's evidence of\ncrime\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nMR. LONG: -- that's enough.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- fine. But it\nturns out he stops the guy every hour of the day, then\nhe has a pretty strong case that this is for\nharassment, and it's not --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for the special\nlaw enforcement --\nMR. LONG: Well, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- need that\naccompanies releasing parolees.\nMR. LONG: And I take it the Fourth Amendment\nitself would prohibit that sort of thing. But it --\nyou couldn't -- you couldn't justify a general warrant\nby saying, \"Well, yes, the officer can search anybody,\nwithout any suspicion, and he can choose.\" But it --\nyou know, the search can't happen too often, or it\ncan't last too long. That would not be -- and you --\nand you -- similarly, it would not be an answer to say,\n\"Well, as long as he's looking for evidence of crime.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but your point\nwas that this is the core of the Fourth Amendment, and\nthey're taking away all of the protection and leaving\nit to the unbridled discretion. And that turns out to\nbe not the case. Under the law that authorizes the\nprocedure, the California Supreme Court interpretation\nis that the Fourth Amendment provides protection\nagainst harassment or arbitrary and --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- capricious\nsearches.\nMR. LONG: -- I mean, my argument is that\nwhat is left of the Fourth Amendment under the\nCalifornia approach is not the core. It's the far\nperiphery. There has never been a case -- and we were\nable to find over a hundred, and perhaps over 200; it\ndepends on how you count -- of cases where parolees or\nprobationers have said, \"You know, this search was\narbitrary or capricious or harassing.\" It is always\nrejected, for the same reason it was in this case. The\nCourt says, \"Well\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then which way do you\nthink that cuts? There's --\nMR. LONG: It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- never been a case\nof a harassing search of a parolee.\nMR. LONG: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that's what -\n- or 200 cases in the --\nMR. LONG: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in --\nMR. LONG: -- I think it cuts in the\ndirection that it is an empty, vacuous standard. It's\na standard --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?\nMR. LONG: -- that's always --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? If it -- if it -- if\nit -- it doesn't go to the suspicionless character of\nthe search, but it does say it has to be reasonable in\ntime, place, or manner.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And maybe the --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- officers are reasonable\nin time, place --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or manner.\nMR. LONG: And -- but it's -- it had -- there\nhas never been a case in which a court has rejected a\nparolee search as unreasonable in time, place, or\nmanner. And you could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many times has it been\nchallenged --\nMR. LONG: As --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on the --\nMR. LONG: -- we said -- we found over a hundred\ncases in which it's been challenged in the California\ncourts. And it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well --\nMR. LONG: I mean, if you think about it, if\nthe search is, say, at night, the argument is going to\nbe -- well, if we said we'd not -- \"never going to\nsearch you at night,\" then you would commit crimes at\nnight. We had a very extreme case in our brief about\nbody-cavity searches. And they said, \"Well, that -- of\ncourse, that\" -- you know, the suggestion was, \"Of\ncourse, that would be too extreme.\" But you could see\nan argument if parolees and probationers knew that that\nwas off limits, that -- you know, that would become a -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say there was a case in\nwhich, without any special reason, they did --\nMR. LONG: No. Let --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a cavity search --\nMR. LONG: No, let me be -- I am not aware of\nany actual case. We posited that. We said -- you know,\nbecause you don't need to know anything about the parolee,\nexcept he's on parole, and you can search for evidence\nof any crime. You don't need any suspicion that -- so, you\ncould have somebody, a sort of white-collar criminal,\nor you'd check someone who's written a bad check. And\nif you say, \"Well, I think perhaps you're involved in\ndrugs. Maybe you're one of these balloon-swallowers\" -\n- you don't need any actual reason to think that's\nhappening, you can simply say, \"I want to investigate\nthat.\" And the way -- you have to investigate that by x\nrays or something else quite intrusive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The California Supreme Court\nmay -- might well hold that it's arbitrary to conduct\nsuch an extreme search as a body-cavity search, or to -\n- I don't know --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to decide to search the\nperson when he's in the men's room or something. I\nmean, there are --\nMR. LONG: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there are a lot of\nlimitations that the California court --\nMR. LONG: They might, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- could put on it, within\nthe context of harassment or --\nMR. LONG: But our principal submission,\nJustice Scalia -- I mean, if California said, \"We have\na terrible problem with crime in California; and,\ntherefore, we're authorizing every police officer to\nsearch every person anytime, anywhere, for any crime,\"\nthat would be, I would submit, the clearest sort of\nFourth Amendment violation you could imagine. It would\nbe a general warrant or a writ of assistance. It\ncouldn't possibly be justified by saying, \"Well, if it\ngets too extreme, if it gets into body-cavity searches,\nwe won't allow it.\" We are talking about parolees,\nyes. Their Fourth Amendment rights are reduced, yes.\nWe recognize that. But saying that this sort of\nabsolutely unguided discretion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the reason ---\nMR. LONG: -- there's no sort of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the reason that people, I\nthink, are saying that is because they have a lot of\nprisoners, they're trying to create a category of\npeople who don't have to stay in prison, where they\nhave no rights. And the real question is, can\nCalifornia, in trying to create this interim category,\nreduce the Fourth Amendment right in the way you\ndescribe?\nMR. LONG: They --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course they can't do it,\nbut the justification is not that there is something\nbad about this particular individual or he's in some\nkind of limbo. The reason is that there's a policy\ntending towards release, which California has decided\nthey want to introduce this as a condition. Now --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and so, what -- and the\nquestion is, what's unreasonable about that?\nMR. LONG: Well, what's unreasonable about it\nis that it goes so far in the direction of eliminating\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of people who are not\nprisoners -- they are -- they have conditional liberty\n-- that it is simply not consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment. And on the empirical side, California is an\noutlier. All the other States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I -- may I ask you --\nMR. LONG: -- and the Federal Government --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Part of\nyour appeal of your case is, you talk about the\ncorporate offender or tax dodger, something like that.\nIt seems quite unreasonable, I agree with you. But\nwhat if you defined the class much more narrowly and\nlimit it to people who have been convicted of violent\ncrimes of a very serious nature and so forth, and said,\nas to those, they can have a totally suspicionless\nsearch? Would that --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- be permissible?\nMR. LONG: -- I -- one of the things we\nwanted to make -- I think there are many things that\nStates can do. They could certainly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I wonder whether --\nMR. LONG: -- there's the possibility of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether you think they\ncould do that.\nMR. LONG: There's the possibility of\nindividual determinations, based on the individual\ncircumstances. If you went --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what I'm --\nMR. LONG: -- category by --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I wanted to see if there is a\nway that the class could be defined narrowly, because I\nwant to ask the other side if they would allow the\nsearch for any ex-felon, for example. You could divide\nit in a way that seemed obviously too broad. But is --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- there a narrower class -\n-\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that you think would be\nacceptable?\nMR. LONG: I think this could be much\nnarrower. And, in my view, it would become a much\ncloser constitutional question if it were limited to\ncertain crimes where the legislature or the State made\na finding that there's a particular need to have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Say you were a --\nMR. LONG: -- suspicionless --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- terrorist, for example.\nMR. LONG: And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's just limited to\nterrorists, convicted terrorists.\nMR. LONG: Yes, perhaps convicted terrorists.\nYou know, that -- and it -- that's very different from\nwhat we have here, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about drug offenders,\ngiven the high rate of recidivism?\nMR. LONG: Well, I -- you know, we -- I think\nyou would have to see the facts of that case, but if\nthey made a finding that, \"Because of the nature of\ndrug offenses, we need suspicionless searches rather\nthan simply reasonable suspicion, and we need police\nofficers, not parole officers\" -- and there could be\nother regulations. The Federal regulations, we think,\nare a model, really. They have lots of limitations on\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Long, is it -- is it\nfair to compare California to other States? The\nassumption would have to be that other States grant\nparole as liberally as California does. Maybe\nCalifornia has made the decision, \"We have too many\npeople in prison. We're going to let a lot of them\nout, but we're going to keep them on a very tight\nleash.\" Why shouldn't it be able to do that? To\nhave tighter controls, but let out many more people on\nparole, which is -- which is exactly what I think\nthey're doing.\nMR. LONG: Well, and I -- I think they can\nhave tighter controls, Your Honor. They can -- they\ncan have -- they could have -- they could make this a\nspecial condition of parole --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But my only --\nMR. LONG: -- rather than a general condition\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- point is --\nMR. LONG: -- of parole.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fact that other\nStates aren't as tight doesn't prove anything, because\nother States --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- may not be --\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- be trying to do the same\nthing --\nMR. LONG: I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to empty their prisons --\nMR. LONG: This Court has said, generally,\nthat what the Court has found to be reasonable for one\nState is reasonable for all. And when a practice is\nnot well established -- and here, it's far from well\nestablished; California's virtually unique -- the Court\nhas taken that into account for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose you were in a\nhalfway house, and the State says, \"We're creating a\nstatus. One is, you're a prisoner. Another is, you're\na halfway house. Another is, on your -- parole. But\nwe want to subject you to suspicionless searches at --\nin all three stages -- prison, halfway house, parole.\"\nCould they do it for the halfway house?\nMR. LONG: Well, they might -- halfway\nhouses, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, are\nlargely now a thing of the past. But if the idea is\nyou would actually be in a custody situation at night,\nperhaps in lockdown, then perhaps Hudson against Palmer\nwould come into play --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This person goes --\nMR. LONG: -- which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- out to work, comes back\nat the end of the day, and is checked in.\nMR. LONG: And so, your hypothetical is,\ncould there be suspicionless searches by --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, while the --\nMR. LONG: -- police officers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- while the --\nMR. LONG: -- at work?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The person who is in this\nsemi-custody state, he's going to work, and, while he's\nat his workplace, the police officer shows up and says,\n\"I'm going to pat you down, and then I'm going to\" --\nMR. LONG: It's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"see if you have\ndrugs.\"\nMR. LONG: It's a -- it's a harder case.\nAgain, our bottom line is, there would need to be some\nlimitations on that individual officer's discretion.\nThat's the core of the Fourth Amendment.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\nMr. Niver, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD E. NIVER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. NIVER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --\nmay it please the Court:\nAlarmed by the State rate of recidivism and\nrevocation of the more than 100,000 parolees,\nCalifornia enacted a statute which authorized the\nsearch of a parolee based solely on his status as a\nparolee. We submit that such a search is reasonable\nunder the Fourth Amendment.\nAs this Court held recently in United States\nversus Knights, to determine the validity of the search\nwe balance the State's need to search against the\nprivacy interest affected. Here, the need is\noverwhelming, and the privacy interest is dramatically\nreduced.\nTurning first to Petitioner's expectation of\nprivacy, it is greatly diminished. Even if it exists,\nit is far less than that enjoyed by the average law-\nabiding citizen. No one outside the confines of a\nprison has a lesser expectation of privacy than a\nparolee.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Doesn't\nthat kind of beg the question? I mean, if we say he's\ngot the normal Fourth Amendment rights, his -- I mean,\nthe expectation-of-privacy analysis seems to me to be\ntotally circular.\nMR. NIVER: That's what the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say he doesn't\nhave an expectation of privacy, so it's not protected.\nWell, if we say he does have a -- if we say it is\nprotected, then he does have an expectation of privacy.\nMR. NIVER: Well, this Court spoke to that in\nKnights and said, unanimously that the -- in Knights,\nit was a probation condition, but I think that it --\nobviously, the same analysis applies here -- that the\nimposition or acceptance of a -- of a search condition\nby a parolee or a probationer results in the severely\ndiminished expectation of privacy enjoyed by the\nparolee or probationer. And this Court said that\nunanimously in Knights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Knights\ninvolved a situation where reasonable suspicion was\nrequired, so it addressed the problem that Mr. Long has\nof unbridled discretion. You still had to have an\narticulable reasonable suspicion with respect to the\nindividual.\nMR. NIVER: That is true, Your Honor, but the\nthreshold question was whether he had an expectation of\nprivacy at all, or to the -- the extent of that\nexpectation of privacy. And the Court, in Knights,\nbefore it discussed the balance, had to identify the\nfactors in the balance. In terms of the probationer's\ninterest in that case, by virtue of the search\ncondition, this Court said that his interest in -- his\nexpectation of privacy was severely diminished, and\nleft open specific --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- and why was\nhis expectation of privacy severely diminished?\nMR. NIVER: Because of the parole's -- excuse\nme -- the probation search that was imposed upon him by\nvirtue of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because of the very\npractice that's being challenged here today, right?\nMR. NIVER: Well, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because he saw\nsomething -- you -- he signed something that said,\n\"You're subject to searches.\" Well, that's what is at\nissue. It seems to me that it's -- I guess I've said\nit before, he's -- it's begging the question to say,\n\"You can do this, because he has a diminished\nexpectation of privacy.\" How far do you push this?\nCan you have parolees come in and take a lie-detector\ntest every week? Do they have -- do they have\ndiminished expectation with respect to their Fifth\nAmendment rights?\nMR. NIVER: With regard to the Fifth\nAmendment rights, if they are not in custody, then --\nor even if they are -- I don't think that that would\nnecessarily -- the -- any expectation of privacy would\npreclude the imposition of a lie-detector test, no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was that a yes, you\ncan have them --\nMR. NIVER: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can.\nMR. NIVER: Yes. But in this case, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, even\nin prison, I -- what -- I'm not sure you could even do\nthat if they were still in prison. Can you subject\npeople in prison --\nMR. NIVER: Well, of course, that would not\nbe a Fourth Amendment claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No, I --\nMR. NIVER: It would be a different --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Chief Justice was trying\nto get out of the Fourth Amendment into the Fifth.\nMR. NIVER: That failing -- well, in terms of\nthe lack of a precedent from this Court, you know, at\nthis point we can only speculate, but it seems to me\nthat if a person can be required to submit to a drug\ntest by virtue of the status as a parolee or\nprobationer, I don't think that it is an extravagant\nstep to say that they could be required to submit to an\ninterview.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say the same\nthing if the offense he had committed was tax evasion\nor price-fixing or speeding? Would the -- would a\nperson on parole for any one of those offenses have --\nbe subject to the same risk of a suspicionless search?\nAnd would it be justified?\nMR. NIVER: Suspicionless search?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well --\nMR. NIVER: Where we're back to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- applying this statute to\n--\nMR. NIVER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- a price-fixer, tax-\nevader, speeder. Do you think it's justified?\nMR. NIVER: If he's on parole, Your Honor, if\nhe's -- look, this applies to parolees in California\nwho have been convicted of felonies, served time in\nprison, and have been --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if it's to be --\nMR. NIVER: -- released on parole.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- applied to the tax\noffender and so forth, how about just applying it to\nall ex-felons? Would that be permissible?\nMR. NIVER: On parole, or not on --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, just the very fact that\nthere's -- they're an ex-felon. And let the person\nknow, at the time of his discharge from prison, that\nthis is one of the things that the State is going to\nexact from you as a punishment for your crime.\nMR. NIVER: If the person is on parole, the\nanswer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm saying --\nMR. NIVER: Oh --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- he's not on parole.\nMR. NIVER: -- he's no longer on parole?\nThan the entire balance changes. The reduction of the\nexpectation of privacy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm hypothesizing a\ncase in which the law will destroy the expectation of\nprivacy, because it will provide that all ex-felons are\nsubject to search. So, they would know, the same as a\nparolee now knows, he's subject to search. Would that\nbe valid?\nMR. NIVER: My answer to that is, it would\nnot be valid, Your Honor, because a person, having\nserved his time on parole, the State's overwhelming\ninterest in supervision has ended. The State has\ndetermined that that person, having successfully\ncompleted his period of parole --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- so you don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Most --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- rely on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Most States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the fact that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't let felons vote. I\nmean, that's a punishment that they impose after\nthey're out of prison.\nMR. NIVER: Yes, but this is not -- yes, Your\nHonor, but this is really not about punishment, this is\nabout supervision. And if a parolee has successfully\ncompleted this parole, has been discharged from parole,\nthen the balance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then we're not relying\non the elimination of the expectation of privacy,\nbecause, under my hypothetical statute, the ex-felon\nwould know he's subject to it. So, it has to be\nsomething other than the absence of an expectation of\nprivacy. Is that correct?\nMR. NIVER: Not -- a person who is no longer\non parole, there is no longer the overwhelming State\ninterest in supervision. The balance changes. Our\nposition would be that that would not be a permissible\nsearch.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that the\nprincipal difference, Mr. Niver, is that when he's on\nparole, it's in lieu of being in jail. If that's not\nthe difference, you don't persuade me. He has\nvoluntarily accepted the parole in exchange for his\ngetting out of jail. And he'd be in worse condition if\nhe were in jail. That's what, seems to me, makes the\ndifference.\nMR. NIVER: Well, that's -- I think that's\nexactly right, Your Honor. The ex-parolee, no longer\non parole, is no longer in custody of the -- of the\nCalifornia Department of Corrections. There is no\nlonger an overwhelming need to supervise the person,\nwho, having successfully completed parole, is\npresumptively not the threat to society that he was\nthat he -- when he was a parolee. The balance changes,\nand such a condition -- that is to say a suspicionless\nsearch of an ex-parolee, I think would offend the\nFourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Niver --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what do you achieve by\nthis system that you have that you couldn't achieve by\na system that more carefully worked out the rules and\nconditions of a random search? I mean, rules, so that\nyou avoid the totally discretionary element. And if\nyou want to have management consultants, as I was\nimagining, have 'em. They're not just going to tell\nyou, \"Go and ask anybody to search anytime he wants.\"\nThey'll have a system worked out. So, why not at least\nrequire you to think it through that much? And,\notherwise, it is unreasonable.\nMR. NIVER: Well, we have disputed\nPetitioner's position that this is a search, although\nsuspicionless, that it is -- that discretion is not\ncircumscribed is our position. And it is, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are there manuals --\nare there any -- here is the cop on the beat.\nMR. NIVER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He sees someone that he\nknows is a parolee. Is there any instruction that he's\nbeen given so that his discretion can be guided instead\nof rudderless? In practice in California, are all --\nMR. NIVER: In -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. What is the\npractice?\nMR. NIVER: In practice, the -- a search -- a\nparole search may not be arbitrary, capricious, or\nconducted solely for the purpose of harassing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you about what\ninstruction, what training, if you know, are officers\ngiven? Or are they given no training, just the law\nthat says, \"You can search any parolee\"?\nMR. NIVER: No, they are not told that they\nmay search any parolee, Your Honor. Rather, they are\ntold that the search must be to rehabilitate, reform,\nor have some other law enforcement purpose. And they -\n-\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. The officer says,\n\"I'm searching to see whether the person has any\nevidence of crime on him.\" For example, whether he has\nany drugs on him. Law enforcement purpose:\nsupervisory, I suppose. They want to know whether\ntheir -- whether their parolees are committing\noffenses. And yet, that reason would apply to everyone\nvirtually all the time. So, it doesn't seem to be a\nlimitation at all. What -- am I -- am I missing\nsomething?\nMR. NIVER: It does apply -- it is a\nlimitation. It is not a limitation that would protect\nthe expectation of privacy of a nonparole --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how does the\nlimitation work? The guy is on 1st Street, and an\nofficer says, you know, \"I recognize this person is a\nparolee, and I have a law enforcement objective. Is\nthe person committing a crime? Is the -- is the person\na recidivist? Is the person violating parole?\" So, he\nsearches him. The person gets to 2nd Street, another\nofficer does the same thing. Three hours later, a\nthird officer does the same thing. In each case, it\nseems to me, their justification would not fall afoul\nof the arbitrary, capricious, or harassment standard.\nIt's not coordinated. They have a -- both a parole\nand a law enforcement objective. Why is there any\nlimitation, then, on the right to search?\nMR. NIVER: If these are, as I understand\nYour Honor's hypothetical, three independent searches -\n-\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Uh-huh.\nMR. NIVER: -- to the extent that that could\nhappen, and I suppose it could, the -- again, the\nlimitation is it be, as Your Honor states, for a\nvalid law enforcement purpose, and it would require --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. No, but let's get\nbehind the rhetoric. Is there any reason my\nhypothetical could not, in fact, turn out to be true?\nMR. NIVER: There is no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from the unlikelihood\nof all those police officers out there. But, leaving\nthat aside, is there -- is there any reason, in the\nstandard, that my hypothetical could not be true?\nMR. NIVER: Well, Your Honor, no, there is no\nreason, but it would -- it requires more than testimony\nby the officers. If the officers at -- each testified\nthat they conducted the search, they're -- also\nrequires a finding of fact by the trial court that the\nsearches were, in fact, for a valid law enforcement\npurpose.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I mean, let's assume\nthe police are telling the truth, and the judge says,\n\"Sure.\" So, there is no limitation. And it sounds to\nme, then, as though about the only limitation that\nwould be enforceable would be the limitation against\nharassment. If one officer did it every 15 minutes to\nthe same person, or if there were a departmental\nsystematic policy saying, you know, \"Get so-and-so,\"\nthat I can understand as being a limitation. But I\ndon't see any other limit.\nMR. NIVER: Well, the limitation is, as Your\nHonor states, if it's a -- for a valid law enforcement\npurpose or to promote rehabilitation or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize --\nMR. NIVER: -- recommend --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but do you --\nMR. NIVER: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you agree that there\nis not any practical limitation, other than the\nharassment limitation?\nMR. NIVER: I -- well, that harassment\nlimitation is sufficient to protect the residuum of an\nexpectation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --\nMR. NIVER: -- of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe it is. But what's\nthe answer to my question? Is that, in practical\nterms, the only limitation?\nMR. NIVER: It is a -- but it -- yes, Your\nHonor, that is the protection.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that\nmaybe cavity searches would not -- would not be allowed\nwithout some special reason for them. And that\nwouldn't necessarily be harassment.\nMR. NIVER: I think it depends on the\ncircumstances of the search.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes --\nMR. NIVER: There's an --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --\nMR. NIVER: -- overarching principle here,\nunder the Fourth Amendment, that the search be\nreasonable, in terms of manner and scope.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. NIVER: That applies equally to a\nsuspicionless search as it would to a search based on\nindividual suspicion. To that extent, it's really not\nan issue that arises from the fact that this is\nsuspicionless.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be arbitrary\nand capricious? You told us harassing would be the\nrepeated searches by the same officer.\nMR. NIVER: Or an -- or a needlessly intrusive\nsearch, as has been just described, or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume -- let's\nassume that the cavity search is demanded at the bus\nstation, and the officer says, \"We know that drugs get\ntransported by people who ingest them in the balloons,\nand they get on buses and they travel back and forth\nfrom city A to city B.\" Any reason that that would run\nafoul of arbitrary and capricious?\nMR. NIVER: Depends on the circumstances of\nthe search. Again, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All I'm telling you is, he's\nat a bus station. The facts are that a lot of people\nwho travel on buses are drug couriers. This person is\na parolee. Would that run afoul of the -- of any\narbitrary and capricious limitation?\nMR. NIVER: It would, for example, if it were\ndone in public view. If the officer didn't, then --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, sure, but the officer\nsays, \"All right. I'm taking you down to the station\nfor a cavity search.\"\nMR. NIVER: Again, the office -- if the\nofficer did it under those circumstances, it's for the\nfinder of fact to decide whether it was done for a\nlegitimate purpose or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're -- I'm asking\nyou to be the finder of fact for me. This is the\nofficer's explanation. This is the factual -- set of\nfactual premises on which he acts. Has he violated the\narbitrary and capricious limitation?\nMR. NIVER: If, in fact, it was for the\npurpose that you state, a legitimate law enforcement\npurpose, and he has been removed from public view, and\nit's reasonable, in terms of manner and intensity, then\nit would be permissible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose you couldn't -\n-\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you couldn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- conduct cavity searches\nwithout some special reason, even in prison. Wouldn't\nthat be -- isn't there some remnant of a fourth-\namendment right in prison that you cannot subject, you\nknow, the whole cellblock to cavity searches?\nMR. NIVER: That would depend, Your Honor, on\nthe prison, the prison regs, the State. I can't answer\nthat question --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --\nMR. NIVER: -- in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I thought the assumption\nof your answer to my question a moment ago was that\nthere was no such limitation, so far as California is\nconcerned.\nMR. NIVER: No, there is a limitation, in\nterms of manner and scope.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, sure. But we -- the\nmanner, in this case, is, they take him down to the\nstation, so that they're not going through this in the\nmiddle of a crowded bus terminal. But the point of the\nquestion was, any parolee at a bus terminal could be\nsubjected to this demand for search, and I thought your\nanswer was, yes, he could be. And now, in response to\nJustice Scalia's question, you're saying, \"Well, there\nmay be some limitation.\" So, which is it?\nMR. NIVER: That if the search is a -- for a\nvalid law enforcement purpose, and it is reasonable in\nscope and manner, then it is a permissible parolee\nsearch, in California.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it depend -- I\nmean, what if he's on parole for transporting drugs in\nballoons from bus stations? Does that make a\ndifference? -- as opposed to, he's on parole for tax\nfraud.\nMR. NIVER: It certainly might, Your Honor.\nAnd, again, that would be -- that -- an additional bit\nof evidence to present -- to be presented to the\nsuppression court to determine whether the scope of the\nsearch was reasonable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But all this is on a case\n-- would be on a case-by-case basis. There are no\ngoing-in guides for the officer on the street.\nMR. NIVER: It's necessarily determined on\nthe -- any search has to be decided -- the\nreasonableness of any search has to be decided on a\ncase-by-case basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the reasonableness here\nwould be unreasonable, unless there are some checks.\nWe're talking about suspicionless searches. And you\ncould have checks. But what about saying -- why is it\nreasonable to do it without any rule-based controls on\nthe behavior of the police? That's the question.\nMR. NIVER: Okay. And the answer is, in\nterms of the competing interests, the lowered\nexpectations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But what interest\ndoes it serve not to have some rules, manuals,\nregulations that help make sure it really is random, or\nhelp make sure it isn't harassing, or help make sure\nthat it's serving the very ends that you hope to serve\nwith the suspicionless searches?\nMR. NIVER: If a State wishes to adopt such\nrules, those would -- may comply with the Fourth\nAmendment. The question is not, what could be done?\nThe question is, What was done? The question is\nwhether California's rule, which permits parolee\nsearches that -- with the -- absolute prohibition of\narbitrary, capricious, and harassing suits, and which\nmust be conducted under the Fourth Amendment, in terms\n-- reasonable, in terms of time, place, manner, and\nscope -- the question is whether that system, the\nCalifornia scheme, is constitutional under the Fourth\nAmendment. And here, the system was designed to\naddress an overwhelming problem that the Court, this\nCourt, has well defined. The -- over 100,000 parolees\nare on the street at any given time. Almost 90,000 of\nthem will be revoked in any given period. They -- the\nCalifornia parolees require intense supervision. The\nstatute, 3067, was enacted to permit that kind of\nintense supervision. And the protection afforded to\nthe parolee, in terms of a requirement of a proper\npurpose --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Niver.\nMr. Marcus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L.

Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nConcerned about the threat that parolees pose\nto public safety, the California Legislature, in 1996,\nauthorized both police and parole officers to search\nthem without individualized suspicion. Whether\nevaluated under the special-needs doctrine applied in\nGriffin, or the totality-of-the-circumstances approach\napplied in Knights, the search of Petitioner in this\ncase, pursuant to his search condition, was reasonable\nunder the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do we have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But not the consent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to decide --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not the consent\napproach, I take it. I didn't get an opportunity to\nask the counsel who argued just previously. Seemed to\nme that he argued consent when he answered Justice\nStevens's question about the tax-evader. But he argued\nthe overwhelming practical needs when he argued the\nrest of the case. And I thought I saw some tension in\nthe argument there. And I take it the Government does\nnot embrace the consent argument?\nMR. MARCUS: No, we do embrace it. We -- but\nwe briefed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you --\nMR. MARCUS: -- the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just --\nMR. MARCUS: It --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- put it in number --\nMR. MARCUS: We --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you put it --\nMR. MARCUS: We --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in number three?\nMR. MARCUS: Right. It --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In --\nMR. MARCUS: -- well, primarily -- for a\ncouple of reasons. First, Your Honor, the California\nSupreme Court has not had a chance to interpret\n3067(a), you know, after the Reyes decision. They\nweren't interpreting it there. And so, they haven't\nhad a chance to revisit their ruling that, as a matter\nof State law, it's not -- there's no consent when it\ncomes to a parolee. And that's -- so, we thought maybe\nthat would be a reason this Court, prudentially,\nwouldn't want to reach that issue.\nAnd, secondly, the -- while the joint\nappendix contains a portion of the agreement that the\nPetitioner signed, it doesn't contain the whole content\nof the agreement. The appellate record doesn't contain\nthe whole content of the agreement. So, we didn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your view, if the\nconsent was straightforward in the documents, would\nthat be the strongest argument or the weakest argument?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I take you'll win\non any --\nMR. MARCUS: We --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- argument --\nMR. MARCUS: Right, we think all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you can take.\nMR. MARCUS: -- we think all three arguments\nare strong. I don't think -- one isn't necessarily\nstronger than the other. And -- but -- and this Court\n-- but if the Court -- I mean, the Court certainly, at\na minimum, can look at the statutes under California\nlaw, and can certainly conclude from the statutes that\nif a -- if some -- if an inmate doesn't sign the\npapers, he stays in prison until his sentence basically\nterminates. And then -- and then, at that point, when\nhe's released, this -- another provision, section\n3060.5, kicks in, and his parole -- his parole is\nrevoked. And he eventually will -- he ultimately will\nserve his whole term of parole in prison, so that the\nCourt can see by the statutes that it is, effectively,\na choice, statutorily, that he -- someone who does not\nwant to be on parole does not have -- does not have to\nsign the condition, and will never go on parole.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long seemed to have --\ntell us something different about that. It's -- they\nhad -- they must go out. He seemed to say they didn't\nhave the choice of staying in.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think it's fairly clear,\nYour Honor, under -- if you look at the appendix to the\nPetitioner's brief, if you -- if you look at a\ncombination of section 3067(b), and then -- which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think he said he was\nunaware of anybody who was dragged out kicking and\nscreaming.\nMR. MARCUS: Right. And then if you look at\n3067(b), and then you also look at -- 3067(a) and (b),\nand then you look at section 3060.5, which provides for\nrevocation if the -- if the inmate is -- or the parolee\nis unwilling to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it really --\nMR. MARCUS: -- sign the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it really isn't.\nMR. MARCUS: -- agreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's -- this is not like\nyou sign an agreement and you're -- you can do it or\nyou can not do it. I mean, this is a real Hobson's\nchoice, isn't it?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, you know, again, if you\nthink that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You can't --\nMR. MARCUS: -- there --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- negotiate, \"I don't\" --\nMR. MARCUS: There --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"want this part.\"\nMR. MARCUS: There undoubtedly are adverse\nconsequences to not signing the agreement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you --\nMR. MARCUS: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- waive your --\ncould you waive --\nMR. MARCUS: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your Eighth\nAmendment rights? You know, if your parole's revoked,\nyou're going to go back into a very cruel and unusual\nprison, not the one you left.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I mean, I think -- I think\nthe test would be whether it's -- whether it's\nreasonably the consent -- what they're asking you to\nagree to is reasonably related to the purposes of\npunishment. And, in this case, the -- you know, the\nsupervision of the parolee, rehabilitation, protection\nof public safety. And so, we think the consent\nargument works very well here.\nBut, if I could, I'd like to also address our\narguments under the totality of the circumstances and\nspecial needs. Faced with a serious recidivism\nproblem, California has made the reasonable judgment\nthat subjecting parolees to suspicionless searches is\nnecessary to protect public safety and to promote\nrehabilitation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it's the case --\nMR. MARCUS: But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that this program would\nallow some searches that are -- that violate the Fourth\nAmendment, but that this particular search would not?\nHow closely can we focus just on what happened here, or\ndo we have to consider all the -- all the types of\nsearches and the circumstances of searches that the\nCalifornia program might permit?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I -- no, I mean, I think\ntypically this Court applies a very, sort of, narrowly\ntailored approach to Fourth Amendment questions, and\nfocuses narrowly on the context in which the search was\nconducted. In this case, for example, you wouldn't --\nyou wouldn't have to reach the question of whether a\nsearch of a home was constitutional. This -- I mean,\nthe question here is whether a search of the Petitioner\non a public street was constitutional. And the Court\ndoes typically limit its Fourth Amendment cases to the\nfacts presented.\nSo -- but, at the same time, in analyzing\nthat, I think you do have to consider what the Fourth\nAmendment standard is. And we believe the Fourth\nAmendment does impose -- the Fourth Amendment itself\nimposes restrictions on the discretion of police\nofficers and parole officers that are meaningful, that\n-- as the Reyes Court said, there are restrictions on\nthe timing, the frequency, the duration, and the\noppressiveness of the search. So, police officers and\nparole officers are on notice that courts will review\nsuspicionless searches very carefully. They're on\nnotice that there are limits to what they can do. And\nthey're --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But following --\nMR. MARCUS: -- on notice that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- up on Justice --\nMR. MARCUS: -- if a search is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Alito's thought,\nsupposing there were no restrictions whatsoever, but\nthis particular search didn't seem very offensive.\nWould you still defend it?\nMR. MARCUS: If there were no -- no, we --\nno, we think there are -- the Fourth Amendment imposes\nrestrictions -- time, place, and manner restrictions --\non the suspicionless searches.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMR. MARCUS: And so, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's asking you, I think,\nJustice Alito's question, \"Do we have to get into\nthat?\" So long as this one's okay, why do -- why do we\nhave to get into whether there might be some other ones\nthat aren't okay?\nMR. MARCUS: I -- that's correct. I don't --\nI mean, I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it --\nMR. MARCUS: -- I think you just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- it was assumed\nCalifornia --\nMR. MARCUS: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- didn't say if they had\nprotection against harassment and so forth. Suppose\nthey just said, \"Cart blanche, you can search any\nparolee at any time, any place.\" And then you'd ask\nwhether this search was reasonable.\nMR. MARCUS: Right. And I think, in determining\nthat, you would -- in determining it and looking at the\nfacts of this case, you would -- you would apply a Fourth\nAmendment standard to determine whether this search was\nobjectively reasonable. And you would look at factors\nlike the time, place, frequency, and manner to\ndetermine whether a search was, in fact, reasonable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, it would uphold this.\nMR. MARCUS: -- and objective --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There's --\nMR. MARCUS: -- objective --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- no matter now\nunreasonable the California statute might be in other\napplications.\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct. And it's to see\nwhether it's objective -- whether the search in this\ncase was objectively related to the purposes of\nsupervision, to protect public safety, and to promote\nrehabilitation. That, we think, is the test under the\nFourth Amendment. And while Petitioner points out that\nthere are a hundred cases out there where the standard,\nyou know, hasn't been used to throw out a search, at\nthe same time, he hasn't pointed to any cases where a\nprosecution has been based on an abusive search that\nthis standard has been too toothless to throw out. And\nwe think that's significant, given that this type of\ncondition has been in place for over 20 years for\nprobationers, since the Bravo decision in 1987. And\nthe parole condition has been in place since 1996, when\nthe Legislature authorized this and made a considered\ndecision to switch from a reasonable-suspicion standard\nto a suspicionless standard for parolees.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government -- is the\nGovernment of the United States somewhat behind the\nState of California? It's not efficient in -- as\nefficient as California in supervising its parolees?\nBecause you don't have this rule.\nMR. MARCUS: We don't have this program.\nThere are -- I mean, District Courts have the authority\nto impose a suspicionless search condition. And some\nhave. I think the important thing to keep in mind here\nis that this is a -- the Court has traditionally given\na lot of deference to States in dealing with convicted\nfelons in their criminal justice system, in making\nsentencing determinations, reasonable sentencing\ndeterminations, as this Court emphasized in the Ewing\ndecision. And so, California clearly has a big problem\non their hands. The recidivism rates are demonstrated,\nthey're in the record. The -- California was\nresponding to those high recidivism rates. They were\nalso responding to some high-profile crimes involving\nparolees. And the -- and, on top of that, we do have a\nbrief that's submitted by 21 States who say that they\ndo need this authority to effectively supervise\nparolees.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has --\nMR. MARCUS: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the recidivism rate\ngone down in the years since the Reyes decision, since\nthis is suspicionless search, as opposed to reasonable\nsuspicion?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I -- I mean, I'm not sure\nif the studies have been -- statistics have been, sort\nof, documented up to this -- to this date, but I think\nit's fair to say that it would be difficult to draw\nconclusions from those statistics, because, of course,\nthis gives -- this provision gives the California\nparole and police officers more authority to conduct\nsearches; and so, there's -- to the extent it's\nincreasing the detection of crime, and so more people\nare actually being, you know, put back in prison on a\nparole violation or a criminal violation, it wouldn't\nnecessarily mean that it's -- this isn't, you know,\nbeing successful in reducing recidivism, because\nthere's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do --\nMR. MARCUS: -- I mean, there's that side to\nit, too.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even apart from the -- what\n-- the lack of evidence for any change since the Reyes\ndecision, do we have any empirical evidence, perhaps\ninvolving a control group, about the likelihood of the\n-- this liberal search policy in reducing recidivism?\nMR. MARCUS: May I answer the question, Your\nHonor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.\nMR. MARCUS: I think, you know, traditionally\nthis Court has been very deferential to State decisions\non -- you know, on efficacy, on whether a particular\nprogram is going to be efficacious -- I mean, cases\nlike Martinez-Fuerte and the Sitz decision involving\ncheckpoints for drunk driving -- in a court. Even\nwith, you know, very strong, you know, low efficacy\nrates -- in, you know, a program that's showing very\nlow efficacy rates, the Court said that these are\njudgment that -- judgments that the States need to\nmake, and they ought to be given a lot of deference,\neven if, you know, their -- the numbers, you\nknow, of -- don't show, by clear and convincing proof,\nthat the problem isn't being ameliorated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMarcus.\nMr. Long, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. LONG: In answer to Justice Alito's\nquestion, this search is unconstitutional, because the\nofficer was completely at liberty -- he had complete\ndiscretion to decide whether to search. And it would\nnot be acceptable if California said, \"You can search\nanybody on the street,\" if the answer was, \"Well, it\nwasn't a particularly invasive search.\" Granted,\nparolees have far less Fourth Amendment rights than\nothers, but this is so much the core of the Fourth\nAmendment. This is what the framers wrote the Fourth\nAmendment to stop, these general warrants and writs of\nassistance. One --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we --\nMR. LONG: -- consent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we normally don't look\ninto the mind of the officer to decide whether his\naction was okay or not.\nMR. LONG: Well, and we're not asking you to\nlook into the mind of the officer. It's --\nCalifornia's system, it's quite clear -- they admitted\nit here -- leaves it up to -- the officer can have any\nreason for doing the search. It's arbitrary, in the\nsense this Court would use, but not California.\nOn consent, very quickly, footnote 16 of our\nreply brief, the California Supreme Court has said\nrepeatedly that -- including very recently, since this\nsection 3067 -- that parole is not a matter of consent;\nit is imposed on you. This is a question of State law.\nPerhaps this Court would read the State law\ndifferently. But, as the Court said in Griffin, the\nState Supreme Court is the last word on the questions\nof State law.\nAs to abuses, there are a number. One that\nI'll just mention, the California Supreme Court has\nheld that it's perfectly okay -- if the officer knows\nsomebody in the house is on parole or probation, they\ncan use that as a lever to go in and search to try to\nfind evidence about somebody else who's in the house.\nThat is permissible under the California standard.\nBut the bottom line here is that this type of\nsearch regime is at the core of the prohibition of the\nFourth Amendment. It's what the framers wrote the\nFourth Amendment to prohibit. So, if parolees have any\nFourth Amendment rights, other than, you know, an\nessentially useless arbitrary-and-capricious standard\nthat's never going to work, the Fourth Amendment has to\nprohibit this search. There are many other things the\nStates can do. They have many options. This is at the\nendpoint on the spectrum.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\n"
