        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 00-6029, Tracy Ragsdale v. Wolverine World\nWide.\nMr. Sutter.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SUTTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe FMLA guarantees much more than 12 weeks of\nabsence from work. The FMLA guarantees a specific bundle\nof statutory rights that an employer must grant eligible\nemployees. In many cases, the company's leave plan, as is\nthe case here, may provide different rights from the\nbundle of rights that the FMLA grants eligible employees.\n825.208 and 825.700(a) implement the statute in an\nimportant way.\nUnder the regulations, 825.208 and 700, if the\nemployer wants a period of absences or leave to count\nagainst a worker's annual FMLA entitlement, the employer\nmust do three things. First, the company must decide to\ngrant the worker this bundle of rights that the FMLA\ngrants him or her. Second, the employer must tell the\nemployee that they have these benefit rights, and third,\nthe employer must tell the employee that the employer has\nelected to count this period of leave against the FMLA.\nQUESTION: Does the act require the posting of\nsome general notice in the place of employment about the\nFamily Leave Act?\nMR. SUTTER: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does. 29\nU.S.C. 2619 provides that each employer shall post a\ngeneral notice in the form that the Secretary shall\nprescribe, so Congress painted it in broad brush strokes\nand intended that the Secretary had the ability to provide\nwhat information is provided to employees.\nQUESTION: Well, can the Secretary then provide\nthat it has to be done by personal communication?\nMR. SUTTER: Well, Your Honor, that is just --\nas this Court noted in the FDA case, just simply because\nthe Secretary has spoken and required posting in this\ninstance does not mean that the Secretary cannot fill the\ngap, as it were, and require personal notice if the\nSecretary determines that such notice is reasonably\nnecessary to implement the act.\nIn this case, Justice O'Connor, I think all\nwould agree that it is difficult to exercise a right that\none does not know that one has, and in this case the\nSecretary decided that the employer must first choose\nto -- that the FMLA -- that the worker will get the FMLA\nrights, and then tell the employee, and this regulation\npromotes communication, communication between the employer\nand the employee.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sutter, may I ask if -- in this\ncase, as I understand it, the employee initially did not\nqualify for the FMLA leave because she hadn't been there\nlong enough. The FMLA is 12 weeks. Her initial weeks,\nthe first 4 weeks had to be under the company policy\nbecause there was nothing else, so is the thrust of your\nargument that therefore she is entitled to a minimum of 16\nweeks, even assuming notice at the time that FMLA comes\nactive?\nMR. SUTTER: Justice Ginsburg, the thrust of my\nargument is, is that the FMLA is more than just 12 weeks.\nThe FMLA is a specific bundle of rights --\nQUESTION: Yes, well, that's a separate\nquestion, but let's assume that there's no difference in\nthe rights under each, and in this case I don't know that\nthat bundle that you describe is any different under the\ncompany plan as far as continuing the insurance and the\npension payments, but is it your contention that she would\ntherefore, because she didn't have enough to qualify for\nthe FMLA leave, she would get 16 weeks --\nMR. SUTTER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- and not 12?\nMR. SUTTER: Yes, Your Honor, because the act\nprovides that only eligible employees are entitled to FMLA\nleave, and eligible employees must have worked for that\nemployer for 12 months, and at the --\nQUESTION: So it's a little odd that when she\ndidn't qualify she gets extra time than if she had already\nbeen there long enough to qualify, in which case it would\nbe only 12 weeks.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, I can see where one might\nbelieve that it is a bit odd, but again, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe company leave plan in this case did not provide her\nwith all of the FMLA bundle of rights.\nQUESTION: Why didn't it?\nQUESTION: Why didn't it?\nMR. SUTTER: Because the leave plan in this\ncase, for example, did not allow her to have intermittent\nleave. Section 2612 --\nQUESTION: She wasn't able to have intermittent\nleave anyway, as I understand it. The doctor didn't allow\nher to go back to work even intermittently until the\nperiod was over.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, Justice Scalia, the doctor\nonly had two options. Because the employer elected on the\nfront end not to allow Ms. Ragsdale her bundle of FMLA\nrights, the doctor had two options. Either Ms. Ragsdale\nquit, or she cannot work for 30 days. There's a third\noption that would have become involved had the employer\ngiven the employee notice of a right to --\nQUESTION: You mean the doctor skewed his\nmedical advice and told her you can't work at all only\nbecause the employer hadn't told her she could work\nintermittently? I can't imagine that.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, it's --\nQUESTION: The problem I have with your case is\nnot -- not the rule that the employer has to give notice.\nThat's a perfectly reasonable rule. The problem I have is\nthe remedy that is provided if the rule is violated. Now,\nunder that provision of the act which imposes a penalty\nwhen the employer fails to comply with the provision of\nthe act, what you're entitled to is damages, what you\nwould have lost, what you've lost by reason of the\nemployer's noncompliance.\nIn this case, I don't see anything at all that\nshe lost, and the penalty under the regulation that is\nimposed for noncompliance with the notice is an entire\nfree additional 12 weeks. It goes beyond any damages she\nsuffered at all.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, Justice Scalia, we -- it is\ndifficult, looking 3, 4 years later, to determine whether\nor not Ms. Ragsdale would have been able to work\nintermittently. We contend that she would have been.\nHowever, having said that --\nQUESTION: Well, but under the damage provision\nof the act you have to prove that. Why isn't it\nreasonable to say the employer has to make her good for\nany damages she suffered, and if you could show that she\nsuffered something because of it, fine, but what this\nregulation says is, she gets a whole nother 12 weeks,\nwhether in fact she could have made use of that notice or\nnot, and as I read the facts I don't see anything she\ncould have done if she had gotten the notice. I think she\nwould have been in the same position she's in now.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, certainly the district court\ndid not address the issue of prejudice. However, the\nSecretary could have reasonably determined that monetary\npenalties were appropriate. However, the Secretary\ndecided that the FMLA is not simply money to be bought or\nto be sold or exchanged. The FMLA is a specific bundle of\nrights that the employee has different rights and\nobligations under. If the employ -- the -- Ms. Ragsdale\nin this case never got FMLA leave because the employer\nnever designated it as FMLA leave.\nQUESTION: But as Justice Scalia points out, the\nemployee under your view gets even more than she's\nentitled to under the act under certain circumstances.\nSuppose that the notice isn't given, and she takes leave,\nand medical benefits are not paid. I assume the employer\nhas to pay for medical benefits.\nMR. SUTTER: Right.\nQUESTION: And also give 12 additional weeks.\nThat seems -- it seems to me that you're having it both\nways.\nMR. SUTTER: No, Justice Kennedy, I do not\nbelieve that we are, because in this case, while the\nstatute explicitly requires 12 weeks of leave in any\nperiod, 2612(b)(1) also allows employees to extend that 12\nweeks over a calendar year using intermittent leave, so\nlooking at this case as simply a calculation of weeks is\ninaccurate.\nQUESTION: But I put you the case in which she I\nwould think would be entitled to back -- to compensatory\ndamages for not having been paid her medical benefits, and\nin addition, so that during the period that she took off\nthe Government counts that for purposes of monetary\nliability, but it doesn't count that for purposes of\naccrued leave, so she's entitled to monetary compensation\nfor the benefits that weren't paid during that unnoticed\nleave period, and she's entitled to an additional 12\nweeks. That just doesn't make sense.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, Justice Kennedy, the specific\nissue here is what happens when the employer provides the\nemployee with less rights than the FMLA bundle of rights\nprovides. When the --\nQUESTION: And the answer is that she ends up\nwith more than what the Family Leave Act would have\nprovided.\nMR. SUTTER: In this case, Justice Kennedy, in\nterms of time I believe the Court is correct. However, in\nterms of the specific bundle of rights, the issue for this\nCourt to determine is whether or not the Secretary has\nacted reasonably when, in circumstances such as these, the\nemployee receives less than what she is entitled to\nspecifically.\nQUESTION: I don't -- well, I don't agree that\nthat's the issue. I don't think you've established that\nshe was deprived of any right that she would have been\nentitled to under the act. You're simply asserting that\nshe -- had she received the notice she might have worked\nintermittently, but as far as the medical advice is\nconcerned she couldn't have worked intermittently. Don't\nyou think you have some obligation to provide that she was\ndeprived of some of the benefits of the act?\nMR. SUTTER: The Secretary may have reasonably\nrequired that this analysis occur after the need for\nintermittent leave arose. However, the Secretary, to\navoid just these types of misunderstandings, required the\ndesignation to be on --\nQUESTION: It's a prophylactic rule that the\nSecretary has adopted, even though the statute itself, in\nthe provisions that it sets forth for where the employer\nhas failed to comply with the act, does not adopt a\nprophylactic rule. It says you give the employee the\ndamages that the employee is entitled to.\nMR. SUTTER: Under either a Morning prophylactic\nrule, or the interpretive powers granted the Secretary\nunder Chevron, we believe the regulation is entirely\nappropriate because the issue of notice is not addressed.\nQUESTION: Well, may I go back to the question\nof what the damages are? On your view, or on the\nSecretary's view, does the employee get another 12 weeks\nof leave if the employee does not need another 12 weeks of\nleave?\nMR. SUTTER: If the employee does not need --\nQUESTION: Let's assume the employee is cured.\nDoes the employee then have the right to enjoy 12 weeks\noff?\nMR. SUTTER: Not unless, for example, she is\ninvolved in a serious car accident, another serious --\nQUESTION: Well, no, but my hypothesis is that\nwhatever the reason for the leave was, sickness or\npregnancy, be whatever, it's over, so that I take it that\nthe additional 12 weeks, or only an additional 12 weeks,\nif the person still has some medical or social need for\nthe leave.\nMR. SUTTER: That's exactly correct, Justice.\nQUESTION: As I understand what Judge McGill\nsaid in the Eighth Circuit, he did say that he -- there\ncould be cases where it would be appropriate for this\nregulation to apply if she could show that she was\ndisadvantaged by not being given the option, so he left\nthat door open if there were some disadvantage. He said\nhe saw none here.\nMR. SUTTER: Yes, and that's an entirely\nreasonable interpretation, a reasonable alternative to\nwhat the Secretary did here, but that is not the -- Judge\nMcGill did not give the Secretary the appropriate\ndeference that she is entitled to in promulgating this\nregulation. This regulation says that determination\nshould be made when the intermittent leave may or may not\nbe needed.\nQUESTION: But his reason, I understand, was\nthat Congress said 12 weeks, and to interpret that statute\nthat says 12 weeks to mean 24 weeks, or in this case even\nmore than that -- because the company leave was 30 weeks,\nright?\nMR. SUTTER: The company granted 4 weeks pre-\nFMLA eligibility and 26 weeks post.\nQUESTION: So his view was that the regulation\nconflicted with the statute.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, and as this Court recognized\nin the FDA case, you cannot read one statute in isolation.\nYou have to also look at not only 2612(a), which says\nspecifically 12 weeks of leave in any 12-month period,\nthereby leaving it open for, as the Secretary has done in\nthis case, identifying four different ways to calculate 12\nweeks. For example, it could be backward-looking. You\ncan -- the employer can look back 12 weeks if it chooses\nto do so, or it can look forward.\nFor example, if I have a broken leg -- if I have\na broken leg, and then I recover from that, and then I\nhave another serious health condition, you can actually\nlook forward to the forward-looking 12 weeks, the 12-\nmonth period, so if you take 12 months out of a calendar\nyou can actually, depending on how you calculate it, have\n24 weeks of leave, depending on how they may calculate it.\nNow, I would urge the Court to read 2612(a) in\nconjunction with 2612(b)(1) which allows intermittent\nleave, which can extend FMLA leave over a period of 24\nweeks if they work half-time, 36 weeks if they work three-\nquarter time.\nMay I reserve my time for rebuttal?\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Sutter.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Secretary of Labor has determined that an\nemployee can derive the maximum benefit from the FMLA only\nif he has accurate information concerning the act,\nincluding the fact that his leave will count against his\n12-week FMLA entitlement. To implement that determin --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, do you think that that\ncan be met by just posting some general notice saying that\nany leave taken by an employee is going to require taking\nFMLA leave first?\nMR. STEWART: No, we don't, Your Honor. The\nstatute itself requires that an employer post notice in\nsuch form as is directed by the Secretary. The Secretary\nhas addressed the type of notice that must be posted for\nthe workforce generally, but the Secretary has also\ndetermined that, although the general posting requirement\nis helpful, an employee who is actually on the point of\ntaking leave for an FMLA-covered purpose needs additional\ninformation concerning the rights and responsibilities\nunder the act, so the employer couldn't comply with the\nregulatory requirement simply by posting a notice for the\nworkforce generally, and the intention here is not to\npenalize the employer for noncompliance with the\nregulation. Rather, the Secretary's determination is that\na precondition to effective exercise of FMLA rights is\nfull and complete information concerning the dictates of\nthe act, including the fact that the leave will count\nagainst the 12-week entitlement.\nQUESTION: That's fine, but where the employee\nhas no FMLA rights, that is to say, where the leave that\nthe employer provides gives the employee everything that\nthe employee would have under the FMLA, why should the\nemployee get another 12 weeks?\nMR. STEWART: First, it's not --\nQUESTION: The problem is not the requirement --\nto my mind is not the requirement of notice at the\nbeginning of the leave. It's the penalty that the\nSecretary chooses to impose when that notice is not given.\nMR. STEWART: Well, first it's not clear in many\ncases, and it's not clear in this case, whether in fact\nthe leave that the employer provided complied with all the\nrequirements of the act. That is, Mr. Sutter has argued\nthat the employer's plan doesn't contain a right to\nintermittent leave. Now, there's a further question of\nwhether this particular employee could have effectively\nutilized the FMLA right to intermittent leave if she had\nknown she had it, but the thrust of the --\nQUESTION: Well, I agree that those are\nquestions, but it seems to me those are questions that\nhave to be answered by the person who is seeking to impose\na liability on the employer.\nMR. STEWART: But the thrust of the Secretary's\nregulation is that it is better to have a bright line rule\nthan to require the courts to engage in after-the-fact\nspeculative inquiries regarding what might have been done\nmonths or years earlier if the requisite notice had been\ngiven and this, to the extent this is harsh, it is harsh\nin the same way that a statute of limitations is harsh.\nClearly, when a plaintiff with a meritorious claim has his\nsuit dismissed because he's missed the statutory\nlimitations period by a small number of days, there's an\nelement of unfairness there, but the justification for\nhaving a bright line rule is, first a bright line rule is\nlikely to produce --\nQUESTION: The statutes of limitations are not\nimposed by regulation. They're imposed by statute.\nMR. STEWART: Certainly, statutory -- statutes\nof limitations by definition are imposed by the\nlegislature, but there are instances, and we've cited one\nin our brief, in which an administrative agency that is\ngiven authority to resolve complaints under an act may be\nauthorized to promulgate reasonable procedural regulations\nto implement that directive, and that might include the\nrequirement that a claim be filed within a certain number\nof days.\nQUESTION: What case is --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart --\nMR. STEWART: This is on page 24 of our brief in\nfootnote 6. We've cited Rennie v. Skerrett, which is a\nSeventh Circuit case that discusses predecessor versions\nof the current EEOC regulations which provide that Federal\nemployees claiming discrimination under title VII must\npresent their claims to the agency within a specified\nnumber of days.\nQUESTION: But here there's something really\nstrange about it. That is, they couldn't give the notice.\nWhen she started on leave she wasn't entitled to anything,\nso here's an employer being more generous than the Federal\nlaw requires in that he's covering her although she's\nworked less than a year, so there's no question of giving\nthe notice when she's put on leave because she's not\nentitled to any Federal leave, isn't that so?\nMR. STEWART: Well, first the regulation -- she\nwas not entitled to FMLA leave at the time of her first\nrequest, but in fact the DOL regulations specifically\nrequire that if an employee requests leave for an FMLA-\ncovered purpose but is not yet eligible for the\nprotections of the FMLA, the employer is required to\nnotify the employee of the time when she will become\neligible, and second, at any rate, when the employee made\nher first request for extension of leave she had passed\nthe 12-month period and she was eligible for the\nprotections of the act, and it's true that in terms of the\nsheer number of weeks of leave that it was willing to\ngive, the company was more generous than the act required,\nbut the fact that an individual or a business goes beyond\nthe requirements of the law in some respects doesn't\nexcuse its noncompliance with other aspects of the law.\nQUESTION: I don't see any noncompliance. You\nsaid about the intermittent, that's fuzzy, but they --\ntheir leave policy covered the health insurance, covered\nthe pension payments.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the intermittent leave is\nitself important, and again there may be a substantial\nquestion as to whether this particular employee could have\nmade effective use of the FMLA right to intermittent leave\nhad she known she had it, and the Secretary might, as the\nEighth Circuit suggested, have adopted the regulatory\napproach under which that would be the dispositive\ninquiry, but instead the Secretary has chosen to\npromulgate a bright line rule.\nQUESTION: A prophylactic rule, which the\nstatute itself does not do. I mean, section 2617(a)(1)\nrequires that when an employer violates section 2615 he\nhas to pay damages equal to the amount of, and then it\ngoes through, any wages he lost, salary he's lost,\nemployment benefits he's lost, and the Secretary comes up\nwith this new rule in which it doesn't matter whether the\nemployee's been damaged at all, we're going to impose a\nprophylactic rule. I don't know any other situation in\nwhich an agency is authorized to do that.\nMR. STEWART: Well, in this case the statute not\nonly gives the agency general rulemaking authority but\nalso provides that it will be a violation of the act for\nan employer to interfere with or restrain an employee in\nher exercise of FMLA rights and, by its nature, that\nlanguage presumes that there will be instances in which\nemployer conduct is not in terms prohibited by the act,\nbut is likely to have the practical effect of dissuading\nor preventing employees from effectively exercising their\nstatutory --\nQUESTION: But if she had no rights, he's not\nguilty of that. I mean, what this regulation is saying\nis, whether or not the employer in this particular case\nrestrained her exercise of rights, whether or not she\ncould have taken intermittent leave, he's going to have to\ngive her another 12 weeks.\nMR. STEWART: Well, under the NLRB, under the\nNLRB's approach to implementation of the NLRA, the\nquestion of whether employer conduct has interfered with\nor restrained the exercise of protected rights is not\nresolved by asking whether particular employees were, in\nfact, deterred from engaging in protected conduct. It's\nwhether the employer conduct is of a nature that could\nreasonably be expected to have that effect, and the\nSecretary's determination is that failing to inform the\nemployee that her time is being counted against the 12-\nweek FMLA entitlement and then dismissing her while she\nstill has the serious health condition will have the\npractical effect of interfering with, or is likely to have\nthe practical effect of interfering with or restraining\nher exercise of protected rights.\nAnd again, the Secretary could have chosen an\napproach under which a more case-specific evidence would\nbe offered as to the actual use the employee might have\nmade of the information, but the Secretary was not\nrequired to do so, and again, this is comparable to the\nsituation in a statute of limitations situation where, if\na suit is filed --\nQUESTION: Well, under the statute of\nlimitations, if a district judge throws out a suit because\na 2-year statute has run and then the appellate court said\nno, you -- there was 3 weeks available there and it was\nfiled on time, we don't give them a whole new 2 years.\nThat's what you're doing.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the analogy to the statute\nof limitations is really that, if the statute of\nlimitations has expired, we don't ask whether the\ndefendant could have done anything differently, or whether\nthe defendant was prejudiced by the absence of notice\nwithin the 2-year period. The -- for purposes of your\nhypothetical, though, the situation might also be compared\nto a tolling provision in a statute of limitations that\nsays the statute will not begin to run until the potential\nplaintiff has received a particular item of information.\nIf that were the situation, then the statute of\nlimitations simply doesn't begin to run until the\nplaintiff knows that, and we don't ask whether the\nplaintiff would have done anything differently had she\nreceived the information sooner.\nAnd again, this is not intended as a penalty or\neven as a penalty for the employer's noncompliance with\nthe regulatory requirement. Rather, the gist of the\nSecretary's determination is, in order to make effective\nuse of FMLA rights, this sort of information is a\nprecondition, and therefore it's a natural approach to\nsay, until the employee has that information the 12-week\nperiod will not begin to run.\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, suppose somebody has\nworked for 5 months but the company has leave that kicks\nin that early, and then 7 months later would qualify for\nthe FMLA, but -- or has already had much more than the 12\nweeks of leave, hasn't been given notice because there\nwasn't any eligibility, what happens then?\nMR. STEWART: May I answer?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: There's a separate provision in\nthe statute that makes eligibility for FMLA benefits\ncontingent upon having worked 1,250 hours in the preceding\ncalendar year and, therefore, it's likely that an employee\nwho had worked only 5 months and then had been on leave\nfor 7 months would fail to satisfy that requirement.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Bennett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BENNETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BENNETT: Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,\nmay it please the Court:\nThe employer notice regulations the petitioner\nand DOL are defending here today allow employee -- they're\npremised on -- their arguments are, Your Honor, are that\nthey allow employees the right to, quote, plan leave, to\ncommunicate with each other. What they have done to\nthis -- these regulations is elevate this right, this\nperceived right to plan leave -- if it's a right, it's an\nimplicit right in the statute, Your Honor. It's not an\nexpressed right, if it's a right at all, and they have\nelevated this right above the expressed right in the\nstatute to have leave limited to a total of 12 weeks of\nleave.\nWhat they have in essence done through this\nregulation is what the most skilled and persuasive\nlegislative body in this country could not do, and that\nwas entitle employees to leave for more than 12 weeks of\nleave. Congress clearly attempted to do that. This leave\nwent through a number of forms before it was eventually\npassed by Congress. The first piece of legislation\nproviding for family medical leave in 1986 provided for 36\nweeks of leave for employees for these conditions, and\nthat bill did not pass Congress. The 100th Congress came\nback with a leave for 26 weeks leave over 24 months, and\nagain that deal couldn't pass Congress.\nIt was only when Congress limited the leave to a\ntotal of 12 weeks of leave over a 12-month period of time\nthat they were able to pass this particular piece of\nlegislation. Congress specifically spoke in the statute\nand in, more abundantly in the legislative history\nsurrounding this particular statute, that their primary\nintent and focus was to limit leave to a total of 12 weeks\nof leave, to grant employees this minimal leave right.\nQUESTION: Suppose -- I suppose that the\nGovernment didn't think of what it was doing as giving an\nextra 12 weeks of leave. They didn't see it that way. I\nimagine the way they saw it is that we think the employee\nhas to have notice at the time that this counts as his\nFMLA leave, and what happens if he doesn't get it? If he\ndoesn't get it, it doesn't count as FMLA leave. That's a\nvery simple requirement and a very simple remedy, and it\nhas the consequence you spoke of, but if that isn't the\nsimple remedy, they shouldn't have done that simple\nremedy, what, in your opinion, should they have done,\nassuming the problem?\nMR. BENNETT: Again, the issue, as Justice\nScalia has pointed out, is not the requirement --\nQUESTION: That's what I'm assuming. I'm\nassuming that they come across a real problem. The real\nproblem is, no, or very few employees, or not many\nemployees notice what's going on until the moment that\nthey have to go for the chemotherapy. At that point they\nworry about leave, and so the agency says, employer, if\nyou want it to count as FMLA leave, tell them\nspecifically.\nNow, we all agree that's fine, and then what\nhappens if you don't? Well, they say, it doesn't count.\nThat's all. Now, you think that part is wrong. Now, I\nwant to know, if you think that's wrong, what should, in\nyour opinion, the agency have done there instead?\nMR. BENNETT: Congress specified a monetary\npenalty. In the statute itself, Congress said you shall\npost a notice advising employees of what their rights are.\nIf an employer, Your Honor, does not post a notice at all,\ndoesn't in any way advise their employees of what their\nrights are under the statute, completely ignores the\nstatutory provision to post this notice, all the\nemployer -- all -- the only penalty the employer gets is a\nmonetary penalty --\nQUESTION: In your opinion, it would have been a\nbetter remedy if the agency had said, and if you don't\ntell them, you have to pay them $10,00 cash. That, in\nyour opinion would have -- I imagine a few employers might\nhave objected to that.\nMR. BENNETT: I think the -- some employers\nmight object to the amount of the penalty, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh well, let's say $5,000.\nMR. BENNETT: I believe --\nQUESTION: $5,000 cash to any employee because\nthe notice provision wasn't given, and all small\nemployers, large employers, any time they fail to -- now,\nwould you have -- you would have preferred that remedy.\nDo you think most employers would have preferred that\nremedy? What amount do you think it should have been?\nMR. BENNETT: Well, aside from constitutional\nissues as a penalty, I believe you have to look at what\nCongress intended. Congress intended that employees get\nthe notice, and where -- excuse me, get the leave, and\nCongress specifically provided where -- a notice provision\nwithin the statute, and that notice provision, Congress\nsaid, if you don't give it, a penalty is appropriate. DOL\nhas now come up with a whole new penalty that far exceeds\nin this --\nQUESTION: I'm just trying to make -- to try to\nunderstand, to put you in the position of the agency.\nThey're trying to do something, and they're trying to find\na remedy for not doing it, and you say it should have been\nlike $5,000 payment, and I want you to see that a lot of\npeople might have thought that was much worse than simply\nsaying, don't count it as leave. Some might have thought\nit was better. So doesn't the agency have a range where\nthey can choose what's reasonable?\nMR. BENNETT: I believe the agency does have a\nrange to choose what's reasonable, Your Honor, but I don't\nbelieve --\nQUESTION: Could the agency choose a monetary\npenalty? Could the agency as a matter of administrative\ndiscretion impose a penalty, or would that have to come\nfrom the -- is that even within the realm of choice that\nthe agency would have?\nMR. BENNETT: Well, again, one of the\ncontingents we raise, Your Honor, is that Congress\nspecifically spoke to notice, all the notice that's\nrequired under the statute. We contend that the DOL does\nnot have the right to come in and promulgate a regulation\nthat an employer notify an employee specifically and\nprospectively that they're using leave, but to the extent\nthat they do, to the extent that there's some perceived\ngap in there where they do have the right to do that, they\ncan't do that where it's manifestly contrary to the\nstatute. In this statute, the primary focus --\nQUESTION: But the question is, let's assume\nthat it would be permissible for the Secretary to say,\ngive them notice that the leave counts as this -- for this\npurpose, that that would be permissible. That was an\nassumption that Justice Scalia was making. Then what does\nthe Secretary have in her arsenal to put teeth behind\nthat, if not the extension of the period?\nMR. BENNETT: Again, the Secretary can exercise\nthe discretion to determine a -- fashion a reasonable\nremedy for the company's failure to provide this notice,\nbut that remedy, Your Honor, cannot exceed --\nQUESTION: Well, what would be reasonable? The\nfine question maybe a question whether the Secretary has\nauthority to do it. What, other than saying the period\ndoesn't run if you don't give the notice, could the\nSecretary have done?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I believe the penalty\nthat the Secretary should have granted in this particular\ncase, or authorized under this regulation, would be a\nmonetary penalty. Congress said $100 for not telling the\nemployees at all.\nQUESTION: Would there ever be an instance in\nwhich the Secretary, on a case-by-case basis, could say\nthat we are ordering you to grant additional family leave?\nI.e., suppose the employee knows that his wife is going to\nhave a difficult pregnancy and he says, I'm going to take\nsome time off under the company plan at the early stages\nand I'll save my family leave for later, and he makes a\nmistake, and the mistake is compounded by the fact that\nthere was no notice. Assume that notice is required, and\nthat that's valid. Would there ever be an instance in\nwhich additional leave would be an appropriate remedial\nstep?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I'm not sure that\nthere would be. The statute provides that an employer\ncannot interfere or restrain. Where an employee feels\nthat, indeed, because the employer didn't notify, that\nthey've interfered or restrained, the statute provides a\ncause of action for that, for the courts to determine, and\nI suppose they could file a claim with DOL, and in that\nsituation they may be able to step in and fashion a\nremedy, but they'd have to show that, indeed, they somehow\ninterfered with --\nQUESTION: Well, could that remedy ever consist\nof granting additional leave?\nMR. BENNETT: I suppose, in those situations --\nQUESTION: Assuming the employee was prejudiced\nin a case that's -- on a case-by-case basis.\nMR. BENNETT: We contend, Your Honor, they could\nnot. The statute provides for leave. You would look in\nthat case the same as you would, Your Honor, under the\nFair Labor Standards Act for minimum wage. You look first\nto see whether or not the basic benefit of the statute was\ngranted. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act for minimum\nwage, for instance, you first look to see if the employee\nis paid minimum wage. The employee may file a complaint\nbecause the employer failed to adequately notify the\nemployee that they were paying them minimum wage. They\ndidn't note it on their check stub, and the employee\ncouldn't tell they were being paid the wage.\nThe first thing you make a determination of was\nwhether the employee received the minimum wage. If they\ndo --\nQUESTION: Yes, but minimum wages, all we're\ntalking about is the dollars. Here we're talking about\ntime as well.\nMR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor, but if,\nindeed, the employee --\nQUESTION: And that's the currency the agency\nhas to deal with, and you say under no circumstance may\nthe Secretary, however reasonable the employee's reliance\nwas, however faulty the notice was, under no circumstance\nmay they ever give additional leave.\nMR. BENNETT: Provided the leave already granted\nby the -- provided the employee had already been given 12\nweeks of leave under the conditions contained within the\nstatute, Your Honor, that is our contention.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not sure it's incumbent\nupon you to write a regulation for the agency. I gather\nyour point is that whatever the remedy provided by the\nagency, it has to be a remedy that is attached to the harm\nthat has been caused. I gather your main point is, no\nharm, no foul. If the employee has not been deprived of\nanything he's entitled to under the statute, there's\nsimply no basis for remedy at all.\nNow, what the remedy might be had the employer\nshown that the employee could have had intermittent leave,\nor if there's something else that the employee could have\ndone with notice, that's not the case that you're arguing\nto us, is it?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, that's not our\nspecific case, that's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, but it might be the case if we\nstipulate that in some instances additional leave must be\ngranted.\nMR. BENNETT: It could be the case --\nQUESTION: If we stipulate that.\nMR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then what the agency, what the\nGovernment is going to say, Department of Labor is, well,\nsince in some instances you grant leave it's just\nadministratively simpler for us to do it this way and you\nalways get the leave.\nMR. BENNETT: Again, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: So it does make a difference in\nanswering the question whether or not leave can ever be an\neffective standard.\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, again, under the\nstatute, you read the statute, you look at the legislative\nhistory surrounding the statute, prior to the enactment of\nthis statute Congress specifically noted in the\nlegislative history that the United States stood alone in\nthe industrialized world as not having leave for these\nparticular types of conditions. Prior to the enactment of\nthis statute, employees in this country didn't have the\nright to take 1 week of leave. Congress was looking to\nprovide that the employees could get the leave.\nFor an employee who receives 12 weeks of leave\neven if the employee doesn't understand that the leave is\nstanding medical leave, what Congress was attempting to do\nunder the Family and Medical Leave Act, Your Honor, will\nhave been satisfied, again assuming, Your Honor, that the\nleave was for the four conditions that they provide in the\nstatute and that the employer at least granted them 12\nweeks of leave, held their job open for 12 weeks of leave,\ndid not in any way take away benefits that they had prior\nto taking the leave, and they helped maintain their health\ninsurance. That was what Congress --\nQUESTION: I think there was one argument in the\nbrief that she could have initially had the company leave\nwhen she wasn't eligible yet, and then she could have said\nat that point, 4 weeks later when she became eligible for\nthe FMLA leave, she could say, okay, company, stop the\ncompany leave. Now I'm taking my 12 weeks of Federal\nleave, and when I finish that, I'll go back and pick up\nthe rest of my company leave. That she couldn't do here.\nThat one argument in the brief for petitioner was to that\neffect, and how do you respond to that?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, we -- that is a good\npoint that Your Honor makes. What -- DOL has taken the\nstatute out of context, and what they are creating is a\nseparate category of leave specifically coded as, quote,\nFMLA leave. The statute doesn't mention that FMLA leave\nwas to be in addition to any company leave. As a matter\nof fact, the statute and the legislative history is\nreplete with references that Congress was well aware that\nemployers out there such as my client had more generous\nleave policies. They put a provision within the statute\nand said, we do not intend by the enactment of this\nstatute to discourage you from retaining those benefits or\neven providing even more generous benefits. What we're\ntrying to do -- and they also provided in that very same\nstatute, Your Honor, that employers cannot craft a\nregulation, or craft leave policies that go below.\nWhat they intended to do was, where an employer\nhad a leave policy that provided for leave, under these\ncircumstances, if an employer had a policy that in all\nintent and circumstances would allow an employee off for\nleave for the four conditions they prescribed, if the\nleave was job-protected, health insurance was maintained,\nan employee didn't lose any other benefits while they were\nout on leave, but the employer's leave was only for 10\nweeks, all this act did was cause -- was augment that\nemployer's policy to require the employer to provide the\nemployee an additional 2 weeks of leave. This act wasn't\nmeant to require the employer to grant the employee an\nadditional 10 weeks on top of the 10 they already --\nexcuse -- 12 weeks on top of the 10 they already had.\nCongress could have said that in the statute.\nQUESTION: What if the employer's leave doesn't\nprecisely mirror the statutory requirements? For example,\nwhat if the employer's leave does not allow intermittent\nleave? It says, you've got to take your 12 weeks in one\nbig lump. You can't work, you know, half a week here,\nhalf a week there.\nMR. BENNETT: The statute deals with that, Your\nHonor, in the section dealing with interference. In that\ncase the employee makes a request that they need\nintermittent leave, which they have a right to do under\nthe statute. Congress specifically granted that. Then,\nindeed, the employer's policy, to the extent they did not,\nthey would be found -- the leave would not be consistent\nwith family medical leave and you've now interfered with\nthe employees' leave, and then the question becomes the\nremedy for that interference.\nQUESTION: But of course the employee has to\nknow about the -- that particular right in order to invoke\nit.\nGoing back to Justice O'Connor's question of\nyour opponent, did your client give the statutory -- post\nthe statutory notices?\nMR. BENNETT: Yes, Your Honor, we posted the\nstatutory notices, and as a matter of fact, because my\nclient has its own company-provided leave policy, this was\nwithin a collective bargaining agreement, and it's also\nwithin the employee's handbook, so the employees were\naware of it through the collective bargaining agreement,\nthrough the employee handbook which was handed out along\nwith the collective bargaining agreement to all employees.\nThe employer, my particular client, Your Honor, has a 5-\nday orientation process, and on one of those days they\nspecifically go over with employees what their leave\nrights are on -- for -- with the company, so this employee\nhas notice provisions.\nQUESTION: But that notice described the\ncollective bargaining agreement. Did it also describe the\nstatutory requirements?\nMR. BENNETT: I do not believe there was any\nspecific reference to the FMLA notice posting, Your Honor.\nI -- the employees are shown the bulletin board where all\nthose notices are posted, title VII, wage and hour, and\nFMLA, but no, they're not specifically -- there's not a\nspecific discussion --\nQUESTION: So that to the extent that there may\nhave been a difference between the statutory requirement\nand the company policy, they would not have been advised\nof the statutory requirement.\nMR. BENNETT: Not by the company, Your Honor,\nbut the statute doesn't require that. Congress said,\nhere's the way employees should get notice. Congress\ncould have crafted another way for employees to receive\nnotice, but they said notice to the employees shall be\nmade in this manner, and a general employer notice be\nposted to all employees, the same as the Congress has done\nfor many of our other labor employment law standards.\nThey have said that's the method we find the best to\nnotify employees of their rights.\nEmployees are notified of their rights under the\nADA in the very same manner. That statute is much more\ncomplicated than this particular statute, where an\nemployee who has a disability that could prevent them from\nworking at all, not just for a few weeks but at all, has\nto know that they have to request an accommodation before\nan employer has a right to grant you one. That notice is\nmerely a notice posting on the bulletin board for the\nemployer, for the employee to know what their rights are\nin this statute, and this one is no different, Your Honor.\nDOL has crafted a whole new regulation. This\nregulation adds a whole new requirement on receiving\nleave.\nQUESTION: If the requirement was so difficult\nto deal with, one would expect there would have been some\ncomment to that effect. This is with notice and comment\nrulemaking, and as I understand it there was no comment by\nemployers about the requirement that notice be given that\nthe leave is counting as family leave.\nMR. BENNETT: I believe there was a notice on\nthese regulations when they came out initially, and then\nthey issued final regulations, and I can't speak directly\nas to the comments that were -- all the comments that were\nmade about this one particular regulation, but I believe\nthe DOL in their brief does mention that there was not a\nobjection --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BENNETT: -- specific objection by employers\nto that, and I believe that to be accurate, Your Honor,\nbut I don't believe -- and I can attest for my client's\npurpose that we did recognize from reading that that what\nwe were going to have to do was grant additional leave,\nadditional leave, that we're not going to be able to grant\nadditional leave, that we're going to have to grant\nadditional leave over and above what we've given them.\nWe've given 30 weeks already for --\nQUESTION: But why wouldn't they recognize that,\nbecause that's what the regulation said. The regulation\nwasn't trying to disguise that that would be --\nMR. BENNETT: No, Justice Ginsburg, it was not.\nI just do not believe that employers fully understood that\nthat was the penalty provision under this particular\nregulation. It's now become very obvious that that's\nthe -- that's a very steep penalty for employers who fail\nto provide the specific prospective notice to employees.\nThe statute says, employer, if you get -- if an\nemployee lets you know that they have -- they need leave\nfor one of these four conditions, you're to look at that,\nmake a determination whether or not the leave they are\nasking for falls within one of those four issues, whether\nit's a serious health of themselves, or family, or a birth\nor adoption. If it does, then employer, your obligation\nat that point is to grant the leave, and you grant the\nleave under these conditions. You must make sure you give\nthem at least 12 weeks, you must make sure their job is\nprotected, you must make sure that you continue their\nhealth insurance, and you must make sure that their other\nbenefits are not diminished during the term of the leave.\nThat's what Congress said all you have to do, employer, in\ngranting the leave.\nDOL has now crafted a regulation that says, oh,\nhold on, in addition to that you've got to specifically\nnotify them in advance you can do all of those things.\nYou can give them leave for all of those purposes, 30\nweeks in our case, but the leave doesn't count. Now,\nthat's clearly inconsistent with Congress' stated purpose\nin providing a leave, what Congress said, what type of\nleave would qualify for leave under this --\nQUESTION: Well, are you therefore saying that\neven the notice provision is beyond the Secretary's power?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, we have taken the\nposition that the statute --\nQUESTION: No, but I thought that's what you\nwere suggesting a moment ago. Is that what you meant to\nsuggest?\nMR. BENNETT: The notice --\nQUESTION: The Secretary cannot even require a\nnotice?\nMR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor. I think the\nstatute has spoken to that. They talk about notice. That\nstatute provides that the employee is to notify the\nemployer of the need for leave. The statute goes on that\nonce the employer receives the notice, the employer is to\nprovide the notice. Congress used the term, notify, in\nregard to employee, and did not use the term notify in\nregard to the employer in that particular case, so you\ncan't argue that Congress didn't consider notice. They\nclearly considered notice, and because they used notice in\none particular portion of the statute and left it out in\nanother particular portion of the statute, there's a\npresumption, Your Honor, that Congress did that\npurposefully and intentionally.\nQUESTION: What if the employer's leave does not\ncomply with all of the conditions, all right, that are\nrequired by the act, and the employee goes off on that\nleave, and there's no notification that the employee could\nget more, could have the benefits continued or what-not.\nWhat happens in that situation? Does that leave count?\nIt doesn't count as statutory leave, does it?\nMR. BENNETT: If the employee was given the\nleave, Your Honor, I believe that the leave counts. Then\nthe issue becomes whether you've interfered with their\nrights under the statute. Did you -- for instance, if you\ndidn't hold their job open, let's just say you gave them\nthe 12 weeks --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BENNETT: -- but you didn't hold their job\nopen --\nQUESTION: Then the damage provision would cut\nin.\nMR. BENNETT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: 12 --\nMR. BENNETT: The leave, it's not like, as if\nthe leave doesn't count. They gave them the leave.\nQUESTION: The leave --\nMR. BENNETT: They gave them an additional 12\nweeks plus damages for not giving them their job back.\nThey just have to provide them their job back and any lost\npay for failure to do that. But this regulation --\nQUESTION: But here there was a requirement that\nwent beyond what the Federal act requires. That was the\nmonthly recertification by the doctor that she still had\nthis disabling condition. For the FMLA you don't need to\nhave that monthly certificate, do you?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the regulations\npromulgated by the Department of Labor provide that if an\nemployer -- excuse me. If a physician certifies that an\nemployee needs leave for more than 30 weeks -- excuse me,\nfor more than 30 days, say this employee's going to need\nto be absent for 60 days, or 90 days, the employer can't\nrequire during that initial certification that they\nrecertify unless they have some other reasons to think\nthey need to.\nBut in this case, the doctor's certification\nthat was provided to the employer was 30 days, and the\nstatute says where the doctor doesn't provide for a longer\ncertification, an employer can require that an employee on\na -- provide certification on a reasonable basis no sooner\nthan every 30 days, which --\nQUESTION: Well, wasn't the 30-day period chosen\nin this case because the employer's regulation says we'll\nonly do it for 30 days at a time?\nMR. BENNETT: That is true, Your Honor. That\nis -- that was the company's policy to require the\ncertification every 30 days.\nThe legislative history again surrounding this\nstatute shows that Congress clearly intended to limit\nleave to a total of 12 weeks leave. The length of this\nleave is the single most contentious issue Congress was\nfaced in enacting the legislation. Indeed, there were\nthose in Congress who wanted a more expansive leave, and\nthere were those who wanted no federally protected leave\nwhatsoever.\nQUESTION: So you're saying it's a false\nquestion as to whether, when the employee takes leave,\nhe's taking FMLA leave or employer's leave, that there\naren't two categories?\nMR. BENNETT: No, sir, that's correct,\nJustice --\nQUESTION: So that you don't have to give the\nnotice in order that the employee can know which of the\ntwo leaves he's taking. He just takes leave, and if the\nemployer doesn't give him all of the benefits that the\nFMLA requires on that leave, then there's a damages\nprovision in the act.\nMR. BENNETT: That's correct, Your Honor, there\nis no requirement in the statute that the employee notify\nthe employer that they're taking leave. The only\nnotification -- the only -- the provision that DOL is\nbootstrapping their argument to, or their regulation to,\nis 2612(b)(2), which says if you're going to do paid\nleave, if you're going to provide the employee with paid\nleave, which is not the case here, this was unpaid leave,\nif you're going to provide the employee with paid leave --\nwhich is not the case here. This was unpaid leave.\nIf you're going to provide the employee with\npaid leave, Congress said, then you've got -- you can\nelect -- employer, you can to require them to use paid\nleave, or the employee can use it if they don't have\nthe -- if they need to take paid leave as opposed to\nunpaid, they can use that, but at that point the employer\nprovides the leave. There's no provision that Congress\nsaid, if it's unpaid leave, you have to designate or\nsubstitute it for company-provided leave. Clearly\nexplicit is that unpaid leave, as long as it meets these\nconditions, is FMLA leave.\nQUESTION: Well, there's no provision, but\nneither is there any clear answer to the question, and I\nsuppose one of the arguments in favor of the Secretary's\nregulation here is that it really was a gap-filling\nregulation with respect to unpaid company leave. We've\ngot to have a kind of default provision to know which --\nwhether it counts or whether it doesn't count, and that's\nwhat the Secretary's reg addresses. What's your response\nto that?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I believe the statute\nitself creates a default rule. In that case --\nQUESTION: For un -- when the company's leave is\nunpaid?\nMR. BENNETT: For the unpaid. It creates --\nQUESTION: What is the default rule?\nMR. BENNETT: In 2612(c) and 2612(d)(1), the\nstatute specifically talks about unpaid leave, leave shall\nbe unpaid. (d)(1) provides that if you're going to\nrequire the employee to use paid leave and it's less than\nthe 12 weeks, then the additional amount between the paid\nleave and the statutory 12 weeks is unpaid, up to a total\nof 12 weeks, so the statute says 12 weeks is all we're\nrequiring. If it's not paid, then the remainder of it is\nunpaid. Now then -- and section (d) creates an exception\nto that.\nQUESTION: No, but that -- as I understand it,\nthat addresses the issue of the character of leave, if\nthere isn't a full 12 weeks provided, but as I understand\nit also there is no clear default provision when we have a\nsituation in which there could be concurrent -- in which\nthe leave could be seen either as unpaid company leave or\nas leave under the act. That question, is it under the\nact or is it under the company's plan, is answered in the\ncase of paid leave but it's not answered in the case of\nunpaid leave. Am I missing something?\nMR. BENNETT: That's true, Your Honor. There's\nno specific provision about that. The statute itself\ntalked about paid leave. It didn't mention the\nsubstitution of unpaid leave. Back again to the point I\nmade earlier --\nQUESTION: And their argument is that because\nthe statute didn't talk about that, there has -- or it is\nreasonable for the Secretary to come up with a rule that\ntells us whether it counts against the act or whether it\ndoesn't in the unpaid case.\nMR. BENNETT: Their assumption is that there's a\ngap and that it's reasonable for them to step in.\nQUESTION: That's right.\nMR. BENNETT: Our position, Your Honor, is that\nCongress specifically decided not to require that. They\ntalk about in the statute a total of 12 weeks of leave.\nThe statute doesn't say a total of company -- or paid\nleave or unpaid.\nQUESTION: Well, Congress may not have required\nit, but at the end of the 12 weeks there's still the\nquestion, did this count under the statute, or didn't it\ncount under the statute, and if the statute was silent, it\nwould seem to be that that would be a subject for the\nSecretary's regulation.\nMR. BENNETT: But Justice Souter, the statute is\nnot silent. The statute says, if you provide leave for\none of these four conditions to one of your employees and\nyou provide these benefits to them, these basic\nprotections to them, then that leave is family medical\nleave.\nQUESTION: You're saying all leave counts under\nthe statute.\nMR. BENNETT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All leave counts --\nMR. BENNETT: All leave.\nQUESTION: -- under the statute.\nMR. BENNETT: Paid or unpaid, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And if you haven't provided in\nconnection with the leave everything that the statute\nrequires, such as a person can come back to the same job\nand so forth, there's a damages provision.\nMR. BENNETT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Which is in the statute.\nMR. BENNETT: In the statute, that's correct.\nQUESTION: And on that assumption, what was the\npurpose of having the special provisions with respect to\nwhether it counts as statutory or company when the leave\nis paid?\nMR. BENNETT: There are many employers out there\nwho -- such as my client who have more generous leave\npolicies. Congress wasn't concerned about those when they\nenacted this statute. It was those unenlightened\nemployers, as Secretary Robert Reich called them in his\ntestimony before the Congress on this issue, those who\ndidn't see the need to have leave of any sort, or\ninadequate leave, that this act was sought to benefit.\nThose employers who had paid leave said, okay,\nwe provide unpaid, but what about our paid leave, can\nwe -- what do we do about that, do we have to provide them\nthe 12 weeks of unpaid leave in addition to our paid\nleave, and Congress specifically addressed that in the\nstatute. If you have paid leave, and paid leave and\nvacation time and other personal time not necessarily for\na serious health condition, Congress said, if you've got\nthat, employer, if you're a generous employer that's going\nto provide that, we will allow you to substitute that\nleave for the unpaid leave we're requiring under this\nstatute. You can require that, employer, that an employee\ntake their paid leave, and then you just make up the\ndifference.\nAgain, Congress clearly thought 12 weeks was 12\nweeks. They were looking to accommodate the legitimate\ninterests of the employer in this regard, not to burden\nthe employer by requiring them to provide more than\n12 weeks of leave in this statute, but at the same time\nbalancing the reasonable needs of employees to have at\nleast -- at least 12 weeks of leave for family and medical\nconditions.\nYour Honor, I appreciate your time and attention\nthis morning. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bennett.\nMr. Sutter, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SUTTER: The company never gave the doctor\nthe option to allow Ms. Ragsdale to work intermittently.\nOn the joint appendix at page 63 and 64 the company form\nonly asks whether the worker needs sick leave. It doesn't\nask, like the certification required by the Department of\nLabor, whether or not the worker can work intermittently,\nand the form does not allow the doctor to certify more\nthan 30 days.\nIn fact, the actual policy at issue in this\ncompany, at issue here allows the company doctor to make a\ndetermination about whether or not Ms. Ragsdale was able\nto qualify for this leave. 29 U.S.C. 2613(e) prohibits\nthat specifically.\nThe question before this Court --\nQUESTION: There's a damages provision for that,\nI assume.\nMR. SUTTER: Yes. Yes, Justice, but there is\nalso a provision for appropriate injunctive relief such as\nreinstatement and other -- and relief as the court may\ndeem appropriate, and I would submit to you that, as one\nof the Justices recognized, this is not simply about\nmoney. This is a bundle of rights that you must know\nabout before you can exercise them, and the company, as\ncounsel candidly admitted, would interfere with those\nrights once Ms. Ragsdale asked for them and the company\nrefused to give them.\nThe question then becomes, then, how is Ms.\nRagsdale, or did the Secretary act reasonably when it\nrequired the company to tell Ms. Ragsdale about her rights\nto intermittent leave, her rights to extended leave more\nthan 30 days, her right to be reviewed by a doctor that\ndoes not have a regular relationship with the company, as\nrequired by 2613(e), as well as her right to substitute\npaid leave. Ms. Ragsdale in this case had a week of paid\nvacation.\nNow, whether or not Ms. Ragsdale was prejudiced\nis a post hoc analysis. The Secretary has reasonably\ndetermined that these determinations should be made on the\nfront end. All the employer has to do is make the\nelection. It's in the employer's power --\nQUESTION: Well, of course, you couldn't really\ndo it on the front end here because she wasn't eligible\noriginally for FMLA leave. It had already happened.\nMR. SUTTER: Well, that's true, Justice\nO'Connor, but the regulatory scheme provides that the\nemployer should have given her a date by which she would\nhave been eligible for FMLA leave. Under the collective\nbargaining agreement this employer had to grant her this\nleave. This is not a situation where it is out of the\ncompany's generosity. This agreement was extracted from\nthe company by the union.\nQUESTION: Well, that's true of most agreements,\nisn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SUTTER: And that is why -- that is why\nCongress required the FMLA --\nQUESTION: But it is somewhat unusual that a\nunion wouldn't advise the employees, its membership about\ntheir statutory rights.\nMR. SUTTER: Of course it is, and it might be\nentirely reasonable for me to stand up here and substitute\nmy judgment for the Secretary's, but it is also equally\nreasonable that the company be allowed the benefit of\nmaking this determination, and to say that the requirement\nthat employees communicate is infirmed, we disagree,\nbecause you see, 2612 -- 2611 requires communication for\nplanning when intermittent leave is required.\nCommunication is the sine qua non -- I'm sorry, we don't\nspeak much like that in Arkansas, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SUTTER: except where you all can understand\nit, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SUTTER: -- information is the key to\nexercising these rights, and if you don't know that you\nhave them, you can't exercise them, and Justice Scalia,\nthat is the interference here, and when there's an\ninterference --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Sutter.\nMR. SUTTER: Thank you.\n"
