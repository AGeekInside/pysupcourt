        "content": "(11:20 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-1437, Carlsbad Technology v. HIF Bio,\nInc.\nMr. Rhodes.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RHODES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe single issue presented in this case is\nwhether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to\na district court's discretionary decision to decline the\nexercise of supplemental jurisdiction. In this case,\nafter the district court dismissed Respondent's federal\nRICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining\nstate law claims under 1367(c). That was not a remand\nbased upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because\njurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court\nby 1367(a).\nIt's been the rule for some 30 years that\nthe bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds\nset forth in 1447(c). And for reference the statutes\nare on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief.\nThose two grounds are a remand that's based\nupon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand\nthat is based upon any defect other than a lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely\nmotion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of\nremoval. The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in\nthis case is whether this remand is one that's based\nupon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nNow, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction\non the district courts in 1367(a), where the case\ncontains a Federal claim and related State law claims,\nand a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand\nthat's based upon the court's lack of subject matter\njurisdiction.\nJurisdiction either exists or it does not.\nA district court's power to hear a case and its power to\ndecline to exercise jurisdiction are part and parcel of\nthe same thing. Absent the power to hear a case, a\ndistrict court cannot decline to exercise that -- or\ncannot exercise discretion to decline to exercise that\njurisdiction.\nNow, in this Court's Osborn v. Haley case,\nit made reference back to Carnegie-Mellon and also\nUnited Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that even if only State\nlaw claims are remaining in the case after the Federal\nclaim has been resolved, the district court has\ndiscretion consistent with Article III to retain\njurisdiction over that cause of action.\nNow, this is inconsistent with the Federal\nCircuit's analysis in this case that a remand based upon\n1367(c) is a remand based upon a lack of subject matter\njurisdiction because in its view an independent basis\nfor that jurisdiction is lacking.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there something odd\nabout saying if it's really fundamental like the\npresence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that\nis not reviewable? It's not disputed, right? That if\nthe district court says, I lack subject matter\njurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong\nas that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?\nMR. RHODES: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with\nthat, because if the court does say that I am remanding\nthis because, either rightly or wrongly, I lack subject\nmatter jurisdiction, then that would fall squarely\nwithin 1447(c) and (d).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Though that could be a\nvery grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion,\nthat that would be reviewable. And I appreciate your\nstatutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that\nCongress would want to be firm that if the remand is for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no\nreview, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could\nkeep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable.\nThat doesn't make a whole lot of sense to\nsay the judge could keep it or remand it, that that\naction is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't\nhave jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have\njurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.\nMR. RHODES: I agree with you, Justice\nGinsburg, that that seems rather confusing. I would\naddress my answer in this way: The review ban of\n1447(d) arose in the situations where apparently\nCongress wanted to -- to inhibit the abuse by those\nseeking only to delay the case by filing a motion for\nremand.\nFor example, a case that is filed in State\ncourt that clearly expresses no Federal question or\ndiversity issue, yet the defendant, in order to delay\nthe case, will then remove it to Federal court. In\nthose situations Congress wants to prevent those kinds\nof frivolous removals to Federal court.\nBut here in, our particular case -- and\nmaybe -- let me back up a minute. Maybe we should look\nat that in a different way, because even though you may\nhave a legitimate basis for removing the case to Federal\ncourt and the district court disagrees with you, perhaps\nthe better policy is that those types of remands should\nnot be reviewable, even though sometimes a district\ncourt is going to get them wrong.\nBut in this particular case, there was a\nFederal RICO claim asserted against us in state court,\nand as a defendant we were not removing that case on\nsome frivolous basis. We were removing it because we\nwere entitled to be in Federal court.\nIt was only after the district judge\ndismissed the Federal RICO count -- and there was no\nmotion for remand on this case filed by Respondents --\nthe district court sua sponte decided that he was not\ngoing to exercise his power to hear this case because he\nthought there were legitimate State law claims and he\nremanded on that basis. Now, that's a discretionary\nremand and normally we would be arguing that where\ndiscretion is exercised by a district court it should be\nreviewable for an abuse of discretion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't it be --\nhere the district judge said: I got rid of the RICO\nclaim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's\nno Federal interest in this case any more. They're all\nState law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye.\nI could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a\nsound use of the resources of the Federal court.\nNow, even if you're right that this is a\ndiscretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction\nbecause the discretion implies that there is power,\nisn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals,\nassuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the\ndistrict judge about questions of this nature, the\ndistrict judge's decision that this isn't worth the time\nof the Federal court?\nMR. RHODES: I'm not sure about the number\nof percentage of cases that -- that there is going to be\na decision by the appellate court to say we shouldn't\ninterfere in that, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't you -- as a\npractical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is\npending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction\nover the State claim, but the district court is told by\nCongress: It's your call; it's a matter of discretion.\nAnd the judge gives one of the reasons that's\nenumerated, that reason being that the State claims are\noverwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed,\nthinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.\nWhy would a court of appeals overturn such a\njudgment?\nMR. RHODES: I think, Justice Ginsburg, I\ncan give you an answer to that because there is a recent\ncase that's in our brief, the Brookshire case from the\nFifth Circuit, where the district court exercised\njurisdiction over Federal and supplemental claims, and\ndid that for quite a while and ruled on a number of\ndispositive motions; and then basically on the eve of\ntrial, after resolving the Federal claim, remanded it\nback to the State court.\nThe Fifth Circuit, because it had the\nability to review that, under the statutory\nconstruction, was able to review that on the basis of an\nabuse of discretion and said that the district court had\ndefinitely abused its discretion. After retaining\njurisdiction for that length of time and then returning\nit to State court, that was a waste of judicial\nresources.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was because we\nwould have to retread the same ground in the State court\nthat had already been covered in the Federal court, but\nthat's not the kind of case that was presented here. I\nknow the case has lingered for a long time, but there\nwas no processing of those State law claims. The judge\nconcentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said \"the rest\nof the claims I'm not interested in.\"\nSo it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit\nwhere there was a large investment of Federal court\nenergy and time and sending it back would mean going\nover once again what had already transpired in the\nFederal court.\nMR. RHODES: That is true. This case is\ndifferent because what the -- what the district court\nhad labeled as legitimate State law claims as to, for\nexample, inventorship, we argued are within the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court, and that is\nwhy we appealed to the Federal Circuit in order to have\nthat issue resolved.\nHere, if we went back to State court we\nwould be in the position of having to argue that the\nState court -- that the State court lacked jurisdiction\nto hear that claim because it was something that was\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.\nIt seems that in this particular situation it would be\nbetter to have the Federal Circuit to pass upon the\nexclusivity of the inventorship issue under the patent\nlaws rather than to have to go back to State court and\nwork back up through the State court system to have that\nresolved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you explain why\nthat is a Federal question? It's a dispute over the\nownership of this invention, right? So it's not a\nquestion of the validity of a patent or infringement of\na patent? It's just the invention is like any res, and\ntwo parties are disputing about ownership. Why is --\nwhy does that become a Federal case?\nMR. RHODES: It became a Federal question\nbecause in our view it arose under the patent laws\nbecause when they filed their complaint, even though\nthey couched it in terms of purely State law claims,\nthey did allege that we had falsely claimed to be the\ninventors; and the basis for that claim that we falsely\nclaimed to be the inventors was the oath and declaration\nthat was filed in connection with our patent\napplications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nSo what they were raising was an issue with\nrespect to our ability to claim to be the inventors of\nwhat we claimed in our U.S. patent application.\nTherefore, since that falls squarely under our\nentitlement to -- to inventorship, of what we claim to\nbe the inventors, under Article I, section 8, it seemed\nto us that that clearly fell within the exclusive\njurisdiction of the Federal court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one sort of\na preliminary question? If we just applied the plain\nlanguage of 1447(d), then this case was properly\nremanded; the remand order is not subject to review. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. RHODES: Yes. If we just read 1447(d)\non its face, that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What really prevents us\nfrom reaching that decision in this case? Because\nactually it's an open question because you were both\narguing about it here and you certainly disagree. Why\ncouldn't we just simply say for this particular category\nof remand orders, we'll just apply the plain language of\n1447(d)?\nMR. RHODES: That would be going against the\nrule that was set out in Thermtron that 1447(d) was\nlimited to only the specified grounds of 1447(c), which\nare lack of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand it would be a\nmodification of the dicta in Thermtron, but why wouldn't\nthat be a simple solution to this case?\nMR. RHODES: I'm not sure that would be a\nsimple solution to this case, Justice Stevens, and the\nreason for that is that if we -- if the Court decides to\ndo that, then we return to those areas where total chaos\ncould really break out, and the reason for that is that\nwe would be in a situation where district courts can --\ncan dress up in language that is lack of subject matter\njurisdiction and remand cases, knowing that there is not\ngoing to be any review.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, no, that wouldn't\navoid the plain language of the statute. Pretextual\ndistrict court orders wouldn't avoid the plain language\nof the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think there's no\nneed to dress up anything. I mean, as Justice Stevens\npoint, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you\nsend it back, it's not reviewable.\nMR. RHODES: If we were to read 1447(d) just\nplainly on its face without --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could we do that in\nlight of Thermtron? Thermtron went against the clear\ntext of the statute that says remands are not\nreviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes\nthey are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a\ndistrict judge to say: Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over\nthis case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a --\nthis is a small-change case; it belongs in State court.\nThe court, I think, was outraged by a district court\nthinking that it could dump a case simply because it was\ntoo busy with more important things.\nThat was the setting of Thermtron, and to\nreach the result that the court reached, the court had\nto go against the language of the statute when read in\nabsolute terms. But anyway, the court did that, and\nthen they gave a rationale for what the new test was\ngoing to be. It was no longer going to be remands are\nno longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to\nbe -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was\nit, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447? The -- it -- the\ncourt read the statute to say less than it in fact did.\nThat's what Thermtron did.\nMR. RHODES: That is the exact holding of\nThermtron, that they were not going to construe that so\nwoodenly to allow a district court to abdicate its\nmandatory jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, \"woodenly\" is\na bit much. I mean, they're going to read it not to say\nwhat it says. And Thermtron involved the court saying:\nI'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with\nother things. I mean, it could be limited to that\nunusual situation, couldn't it?\nMR. RHODES: Mr. Chief Justice, it could,\nbut --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it would solve\nthe problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that\nthis way you don't get to appeal big things like no\nsubject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal\npicayune things.\nMR. RHODES: Again, I'm not sure how we\nwould divide those up between big things and picayune\nthings. But I think, to answer your question, we have\n30 years of this particular rule under Thermtron being\nuniformly applied by all the circuit courts of appeal,\nand they have found this to be a workable, statutory\ninterpretation to give them a framework to handle these\nkinds of cases. And it's not a situation where the\ncircuit courts of appeal have run away from situations\nlike this, where remands have been based upon declining\nto exercise discretionary power to send it back to State\ncourt. They have seemed to want to work within the\nstatutory framework to review those kinds of cases.\nAnd I think it would be a large departure to\ngo back and try to modify what all the circuit courts of\nappeal, except for maybe the Federal Circuit, had\nadopted as a workable framework in order to solve these\nkinds of problems.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one clear way to do\nit would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has\nasked for that. You haven't asked for it and the other\nside hasn't asked for it.\nMR. RHODES: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You just have to\ndistinguish Thermtron. You don't have to overrule it.\nYou'd still apply it on its facts.\nThat's a very different problem. When the\njudge says, I'm too busy to hear this, I'm going to send\nit back to State court, that's what Thermtron resolved.\nHere --\nMR. RHODES: And yet --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not involved here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your concern is what\nwas the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the\nCourt's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to get rid of\nQuackenbush, too, don't you?\nMR. RHODES: Yes, Quackenbush is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Throw that overboard, too?\nMR. RHODES: We would have to overthrow that\nas well, and the reason for that is because Quackenbush\nwas a remand based upon -- an abstention-based remand\nunder Burford, and in that case, this Court found that\nabstention-based remands did not fall within either\nprong of 1447(c). So -- in fact, this Court gave that\nvery little attention in Quackenbush before it moved on\nto the 1291 issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You thought the\nRespondents asked us to overrule Thermtron. On page 22,\nyou say, \"Respondents' implicit request for this Court\nto overrule Thermtron should be rejected.\"\nMR. RHODES: Yes, we did say that, and I'm\nnot sure that they -- they expressly said you should\noverrule Thermtron, but the strong suggestion in their\nbrief was perhaps you should.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't it -- isn't it\nalso the case that Congress has amended the relevant\nprovisions of 1447 since Thermtron and they have not\nseen fit to overrule or change those provisions?\nMR. RHODES: Given the fact that Congress\nhas twice amended 1447(c) after Thermtron, it seems that\nthey have actually ratified this Court's statutory\nconstruction under Thermtron, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this gets a lot\nof attention across the street? The reviewability of\nremand orders gets --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, in one of\nthose provisions they said this was only technical\namendments, and if they're just doing technical\namendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and\napprove the whole thing.\nMR. RHODES: No, Mr. Chief Justice, if they\nwanted to get rid of Thermtron they could have done it\nin a very direct way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right, but\nwhat if we want to get rid of it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RHODES: I can't suggest what the Court\nmight finally decide other than to say that -- that,\nagain, the circuit courts of appeal have uniformly\napplied this. They seem to be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't\nhave a choice, right? They can't say, I don't like the\nSupreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other\nthan the Federal Circuit.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RHODES: Actually, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat was going to be my next point. Not the Federal\nCircuit -- but it does, again, provide a workable\nframework for dealing with these issues, and it seems to\nbe a very large departure to go back and wipe out the\nlast 30 years of case law that has been developed to\nhandle these issues. It would be a large departure.\nIf there's no other questions, I'll reserve\nthe remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just make one\ncomment on the large departure: Would it be a large\ndeparture if we just said, in the very narrow category\nof cases where there has been a remand on the basis of\n-- the district judge doesn't want to exercise\nsupplementary jurisdiction over State law claims, that's\nnot appealable, period? Just say that's a slight\nexception from Thermtron?\nMR. RHODES: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --\nsorry -- Justice Stevens, that would be an exception\nunder Thermtron that doesn't seem to be called for\nbecause the way it's been interpreted, it has to be --\nand the way even the amendments in '88 and again in '96\n-- it's only barred if it's for a lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, and plainly here a discretionary remand --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not for that basis?\nThey're not amendments of subsection (d), and subsection\n(d) is what has the language that really reads right on\nthis case.\nMR. RHODES: Well, I think the other -- the\nother problem with that is the whole doctrine of -- of\nsupplemental jurisdiction that was first laid out in\nCarnegie-Mellon and United Mine Workers, where the\ndifference between remands under 1367(c) seem not to\noverlap with the remands under 1447(d) and 1441. So if\nwe made that an exception and we pulled this into\n1447(d), it -- I'm not sure what the consequences would\nbe from doing that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Allison.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE S. ALLISON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ALLISON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nLet me begin with Petitioner's counsel's\nlast remark, and that is that we don't know what the\nconsequences would be, except that we do know that by\napplying the review bar to supplemental jurisdiction\nremands, it would bring us closer to achieving the\npurpose that has been expressed in the statutes of\nCongress since 1887.\nI know that the Court is familiar with the\nlate Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion when\nhe was an Associate Justice in the Thermtron case and\nJustice Rehnquist at that time wrote that there had been\nno cases since the review bar was put into place in\n1887, no cases where exceptions to review had been\nrecognized. He believed that it was a plenary bar on\nreview.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a dissenting\nopinion, and that was how many years ago? How many\nyears?\nMR. ALLISON: Justice Ginsburg, it -- it was\na dissenting opinion, and it was in 1976, and we\ncertainly would not cite it as authoritative except for\nour confidence in Justice Rehnquist's review of the law\nas it existed at that time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have a majority\nrationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute\nterms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those\nbased on a defect in the removal or lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. So you can't say, well, Thermtron\nhad a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own\nunusual facts because the court gave a rationale. I\nmean, courts give reasons for what they do. And the\ncourt drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d)\nhas to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals\nwith only two kinds of remands, one for defective\nremoval and the other for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction.\nMR. ALLISON: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And, in fact, to harken to your earlier\nquestion, to Your Honor's earlier question, we are not\nasking for Thermtron to be overruled, but I think, in\neffect, to be updated.\nThe Court in Thermtron did give a rationale,\nand the rationale that it gave was that it viewed, the\nopinion for the Court by Justice White viewed 1447(c) as\nbeing the sole source of Federal remand power. And as\nthe Court noticed in the ensuing 30, 40 -- excuse me --\nyes, 40-odd years, there have been a number of other\nsources of remand power recognized.\nAnd we see no reason why the holding in\nThermtron should not be overruled but be updated to\nrecognize that the spirit of what the Court held in that\ncase would be served and would be harmonized with the\nreview bar as it has existed lo these 120 odd-years,\nwould be served by expanding the -- excuse me,\ncontracting the reach of Thermtron so that it is not\nsimply 1447(c) remands, but any remand authorized by\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But no matter -- no\nmatter what adjective or what verb you use, that's\noverruling a very clear rule of Thermtron. And we\nnormally operate on a theory that when a conventional\nstatute is construed by this Court, it stays construed\nuntil Congress changes it.\nAnd I don't -- I don't see how you can\nfollow the line of reasoning that you're proposing, even\nthough you talk about updating and harmonizing, without\nviolating that basic stare decisis rule.\nMR. ALLISON: It's an essential question,\nJustice Souter. And I think the way we harmonize it is\nto say that Thermtron has indeed been pared back by the\nCourt's subsequent decisions. And, of course, it is our\nsecond argument that the Court do something with the\nrule in Thermtron.\nOur primary argument gets to the question of\nthe statutory language and whether a Cohill remand falls\nwithin it. But our secondary argument is to say,\ncertainly, it's well recognized that Cohill disapproved\nand pared down that portion of Thermtron that held that\nthe only remand power is the remand power expressed in\n1447(c).\nAnd a later case, in Quackenbush, the\nquestion of whether mandamus or appeal was the\nappropriate vehicle for challenging remand orders. And\nin that case, again, the Court said that we are\ndisavowing Thermtron's sweeping statement that mandamus\nis the only vehicle for challenging a remand order.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We did -- we did not\ndisavow the relationship between (c) and (d).\nMR. ALLISON: Indeed, the Court did not.\nAnd we suggest again only -- it is only a suggestion in\nour brief that the Court might wish to look at the\nensuing history since Thermtron and make a similar\nlimiting statement that recognizes that a lot of remand\nauthority has been established since Thermtron, and a\nnumber of statutes by the Court's -- by the Court's\nholding in Cohill.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What in addition to the\ncivil rights provision?\nMR. ALLISON: Well, indeed in Things\nRemembered, the Court was considering whether a 1447's,\ncomma -- whether 1447's review bar applied to a remand\nunder 1452. 1452 is another statute that deals with\nremands in the context of cases associated with\nbankruptcy issues. And in that case, there was a remand\nfor failing to follow a removal procedure, and the Court\nheld, citing Rice, United States versus Rice, based on\nCongress's awareness of the universality of the review\nban. That when another statute comes in place that\nprovides for remand, for the review bar applies whether\nor not, of course --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that's a specific\nstatute that would prevail over the general provision.\nMR. ALLISON: It's a little bit -- Justice\nGinsburg, it's a little bit different than the Court's\ndecision in Osborn, in which the much more specific\nWestfall Act Provision was held to prevail over 1447.\nIn Things Remembered, it was simply the fact\nthat the review bar was held to apply to a remand, even\naccording -- under another statute, and, of course,\nrecognizing that there are now other statutory bases for\nremand. The interesting thing about 1452 -- and Justice\nGinsburg, I believe you wrote the concurrence on this --\nis that 1452 provides for remand on any equitable\nground, and that such remands are not subject to review\nby appeal or otherwise.\nSo 1452, again, expresses, I think, a trend\nin the thinking of Congress, if there is such a thing as\nthe thinking of Congress, that the review bar will be\nexpanded and will even include such discretionary\ndecisions by a district court as any equitable ground.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Things Remembered, I\nthink, was raised very carefully, such to say that the\nquestion that's before the Court now has not been\ndecided before, the precise question here --\nMR. ALLISON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- discretionary remand?\nMR. ALLISON: That is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and I think, I\nlooked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to\nbe just as I remembered it --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was neutral,\ncolorless. It just said we haven't been confronted with\nthis issue. And I think Powerex said the same thing,\nalthough it said it in more definite terms, it is far\nfrom clear.\nMR. ALLISON: That is true, and that is what\nthe federal circuit said -- meant when it said that\nPowerex made the question precedential. Because,\ncertainly, if Things Remembered had decided the issue\nthat's before the Court today, I think the issue\nwouldn't be before the Court today. And that is, of\ncourse, why we're here.\nBut the Thermtron -- the Thermtron issue\nreally is our second argument, and the it is a very\ngentle argument that the Court -- and if the Court\ncertainly wishes to continue discussing that, that is --\nthat is very profitable for what we're doing here today.\nBut the first argument is that, harkening\nback to your original questions, Justice Ginsburg, why\nshouldn't a remand when only state law claims remain in\na case, and -- Cohill 1367(c)3 why should that not come\nwithin the language of 1447(c), what I'll call the\njurisdictional clause, because it clearly is a matter\nthat is only of concern to state courts -- and I think\nthat the Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs made\nclear that when all State -- all the federal claims have\nleft the case and only State law claims remain, that\nit's almost presumptive that those should be sent back.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but your opponent's\nargument is that the claims that remain do include a\nfederal claim.\nMR. ALLISON: That is true, Justice Stevens.\nThat is his argument. And I think what's important\nabout that argument is the inconsistency it sets up. It\nessentially casts a net that draws in these supplemental\njurisdiction cases. And what the net does is it allows\nthe courts of appeals to review some artful pleading\nissues, which is essentially what we have here. We have\nstate law claims, and our opponents are suggesting that\nthese are, in fact, disguised federal claims that must\nbe heard in federal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What about the ruling on\nthe RICO claim itself? That was clearly a federal\nissue.\nMR. ALLISON: Yes. The RICO claim was\nwhat -- was what gave the district court jurisdiction\nover the case in the first place. And it's interesting\nthat in the district court's decision, it made me\nthink -- it made me think a little bit of the Waco case,\nbecause in the district court's decision, the district\ncourt very clearly said, first, I have no jurisdiction\nover these State law claims, and I'm going to remand\nthem, and now I will turn to the RICO claim which\ncreates a conundrum that I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe the district judge\ndidn't say that. Maybe you can point me to the place\nwhere it did. But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong,\nbecause there is -- that's what supplemental\njurisdiction is. It's says you have jurisdiction, it's\na huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you\nare powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to\nexercise it or not.\nMR. ALLISON: Justice Ginsburg, that's why\nwe didn't -- we didn't press that point because I think\n-- I think that even we can see that the court exercised\nits jurisdiction to decide and dismiss the RICO claim,\nalthough it's reminiscent of -- of -- of the decision\nin Kircher --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't a discretionary\ndecision about RICO. RICO -- there was no Federal\nclaims stated. That's out of it.\nMR. ALLISON: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What the district court\nhas jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which\nit can choose not to exercise, but it can say, \"I don't\nhave jurisdiction,\" because Congress has given\nsupplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court\nto remand on stated conditions.\nBut you -- you seem to conflate the absence\nof subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary\ndecision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction\nthat the court undoubtedly has.\nMR. ALLISON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have\nmade every effort not to conflate those two -- those two\nconcepts, and in fact we did say that when -- when a\ncourt acquires supplemental jurisdiction in a case, that\nthat is a species of subject matter jurisdiction at that\npoint, as the Court held in City of Chicago v\nInternational College of Surgeons.\nAt that point the court does have a\nmandatory discretion -- or mandatory jurisdiction to\nexercise power over the entire Article III case; but we\nthen argue when the Federal claims leave the case that\njurisdiction changes. That jurisdiction changes from a\nmandatory one that the court, as in Thermtron, would\ncertainly be concerned if the district court had -- if\njurisdiction that's mandatory. But it changes by\noperation of 1367 from mandatory to discretionary; and\nwhen Congress passed 1367 in 1990, Congress intended to\ncodify the existing law right up through Cohill on the\nsubject of supplemental jurisdiction, combining\nancillary and intended in those --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your idea is\nthere is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall\nout then there is no jurisdiction?\nMR. ALLISON: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but that seems\nto me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you\nhave Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event --\nlet's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that\ngives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal\njurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't\ndumping chemicals with it. You don't then say \"there is\nno jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once\nthe finding is made that the facts didn't support it,\nthen there was no jurisdiction.\" You say, \"there was\njurisdiction all the time and you lose.\"\nMR. ALLISON: There was -- there was indeed\njurisdiction. And what we argue is that the nature of\nthe change, when it goes from mandatory, the concern of\nThermtron, to discretionary, which gives -- virtually\npushes out of the Federal Court to the State courts\nanytime up until trial -- the nature of that\njurisdiction changes; and we believe that that is not\nwhat Congress intended by the words \"subject matter\njurisdiction\" in 1447(c).\nSo if we come back to the words of the\nstatute, the words of the statute should be construed\nbroadly in order to serve the purposes of -- of remand.\nThe Court has made clear that concerns of comity and\nfederalism say that we should construe 1447 in favor of\nremand and I believe that that should extend to the\nconcept of the whole delay of concept and shuttling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- when what you are\ndoing is that you are using the label \"subject manager\njurisdiction\" in a way that seems to me, that -- there\nare many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the\nedges, but not subject matter jurisdiction. Subject\nmatter jurisdiction means court, you have no power,\nperiod. There's no diversity, there's no Federal\nquestion, there's no other basis for the Federal Court\nto exercise jurisdiction; and to say, \"Well, we can\nextend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include\na case where the district court chooses not to hear\nseveral claims, even though it has jurisdiction over\nthem.\" I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the\nnotion subject matter jurisdiction.\nMR. ALLISON: It is -- it is a difficult, a\ndifficult conundrum. I think maybe all conundra are\ndifficult, but this one particularly. And, Justice\nGinsburg, in the opinion that you wrote for the Court in\nthe RBOC case, you very clearly pointed out that the\nword \"jurisdiction\" is used in a variety of ways by\nlegal scholars --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not subject\nmatter jurisdiction. Jurisdiction -- personal\njurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction. When I did\nin -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all\nkinds of things like time limits on when you can sue,\nhave been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when\nthey are not. They are simply statutes of limitation.\nMR. ALLISON: That -- that is correct, but\nthat is -- that is the nature of the problem -- that is\nthe nature of the problems that this Court confronted in\nKircher and Powerex -- again this is by analogy only.\nWe are not concerned about labels like that, if the\ndistrict court believes that it was remanding the case\nbecause it lacked jurisdiction.\nBut I'm coming back to subject matter\njurisdiction, and I have found no case in this Court\nthat has given a definition -- Chicago with its\nmandatory language was the closest I was able to find.\nThe Koffski case out of the Seventh Circuit\nis the one case I was able to find from a higher court\nthat said that supplemental jurisdiction is technically\na form of subject matter jurisdiction. What we argue --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it only technical?\nIt says court, you can exercise power. Subject matter\njurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given\ncontroversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there\nis undoubted power in the district court to hear those\nclaims.\nMR. ALLISON: In a -- certainly I think in a\ntextbook sense, that is what subject matter -- when the\nworld is divided between subject matter and personal and\nthird, territorial, which I think is a relation -- has\nrelation to personal -- when the world is divided along\nthose lines, then subject matter takes on the broadest\npossible meaning, but we have conflicting broad\npolicies. On the one hand, we have a broad definition\nof subject matter definition; on the other hand we have\na statute which should be construed to favor remand at\nalmost all lawful cost.\nAnd -- and subject matter, if we step back\nfrom our -- our dichotomy, personal and subject matter,\nsubject matter also means, as -- as Your Honor said at\nthe beginning of this argument, something that is --\nthat is a subject with which the Federal courts should\nbe concerned, and on which they should expend their\nresources; and we now have the circuit courts hearing\nappeals from decisions, discretionary decisions because\nthey are technically within the realm of subject matter\njurisdiction. But clearly, State law claims are not the\nsubject matter with which the Federal courts should\nroutinely be concerned, and that's why United Mine\nWorkers -- and Cohill echoed it -- says, these claims\nshould be sent back, and Cohill even -- both cases even\nsaid that the propriety of remanding the claims should\nbe reviewed at every stage in the litigation. That --\nthat I think presents us a pretty strong policy by this\nCourt that remand is to be indulged at almost any lawful\ncost.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You put it in terms in\nyour brief, if I understood your position correctly,\nyes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over\nsupplemental claims, but once the district court chooses\nnot to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were\nthe words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.\nMR. ALLISON: Yes. The -- the argument --\nand I was attempting to make a technical argument in the\nbrief, and I think today I'm speaking in slightly more\nglobal terms -- but the technical argument is that when\na district court makes a decision, in the words of\nGibbs, that it would be inappropriate to exercise\njurisdiction over those claims, then the claims are to\nbe remanded.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about if it changes its\nmind?\nMR. ALLISON: Justice Alito, the question of\nwhether a -- question of reviewability because the cases\nthat we found that -- that talked about reconsideration\ntalked about reconsideration only because there was the\npotential for review of these orders.\nI think the norm for a remanded case is that\nthe order of remand is entered, and the order of remand\nis certified and mailed to the State court, and the\ndistrict court no longer has jurisdiction at that point.\nNow, certainly it could reconsider as it's\nengaged in its decision process. It could go back and\nforth and reconsider it before it signs the order. But\nthat's no different than -- than many other cases in\nwhich the court can make a discretionary decision that\nit has no jurisdiction. The only --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretionary\ndecision is that it chooses not to hear the case. It's\nnot that -- there is no discretion there. There's\nnothing discretionary about saying we have no\njurisdiction. \"We have no jurisdiction\" means we have\nno power. So the -- the two are just at odds with each\nother. No power, yes power, but we choose not to\nexercise it.\nMR. ALLISON: And I think -- I think that\nthe -- again, the purpose of the review bar as it's been\nexpressed for over a hundred years has been to trust\ndistrict judges to make these decisions and then get the\ncase where it needs to be to be resolved on its merits.\nSo to say that the court chooses not to hear the case,\nit -- it suggests something a little bit less gray than\nthe decision that I believe the court would make when it\ndecides that it's inappropriate to hear the case, in the\nwords of Gibbs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you think that\nchoosing not to hear is distinguishable from a decision\nthat it is inappropriate to hear?\nMR. ALLISON: I -- I meant only to suggest\nthat it is not a -- it is not a choice. It is a -- not\na -- an ill-considered choice. Certainly, there's a\nchoice involved in the decision that it would be\ninappropriate. But I don't see -- and I -- I wanted to\nresist a rhetorical question, but then I don't see how\nanyone could say when a court is faced with -- with only\nState-law claims that it could either decide or not and\nit decides it would be inappropriate to retain\njurisdiction over those claims, that somehow it should\nretain jurisdiction over those claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would argue\nfor a highly deferential standard of review, respecting\nthe district judge's determination that it's not what --\nit hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it\nshouldn't because they are purely state-law questions.\nThat's -- but that's something quite different from --\nfrom a -- the -- the terminology that you used is\ntroublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest\nitself of jurisdiction.\nIf Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has\nit, and the Court can't divest itself of that. It can,\nif Congress permits it, decline to exercise\njurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting\nitself of jurisdiction.\nMR. ALLISON: I believe -- well -- and --\nand this is a mechanical argument, but I believe that\nwhen the court makes the decision and then -- and then\nanticipates the remand, that that is divesting itself of\njurisdiction. And perhaps it was -- perhaps it was a\npoor -- a poor word choice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But even -- even on your\nanalysis it seems to me that the -- the cart is before\nthe horse, because it is -- it is not remanding because\nit does not have jurisdiction. What you are saying is\nthat after it remands, it loses jurisdiction, and those\nare two very distinct categories.\nThe -- the premise for the declaration that\nit does not have jurisdiction is a premise that even on\nyour argument does not arise until a following\nagreement. So there's no way you can fit it, it seems\nto me, into the category of -- of remanding because at\nthe point of deciding to remand it has no jurisdiction.\nThat, in fact, is false.\nMR. ALLISON: It is simply a question, I\nthink, of -- of the choice of the word \"divest\" and what\nthat means. I would -- I would analogize in order to\nperhaps make it seem more -- more accurate -- I would\nanalogize it to what a district court now can do under\nsection 1447(e) where it makes a decision in applying\nthe law and using its discretion to allow joinder of a\nnondiverse party. That would then destroy diversity and\nrequire the case to be remanded.\nAnd I would say in that case that the court\nmakes a decision that divests it of jurisdiction, and it\nis very technical to say that -- - that, yes, it lacks\njurisdiction as soon as it enters the order admitting\nthat party to the case. But that may very well be the\nsame order that remands the case to the State court.\nBut I -- I do -- I do see that there is\npower. And if the case is going to turn on power, as\nthe Court -- or some of the language in Powerex\nsuggested that it might, then I don't know that we -- I\ndon't know that we make much headway. But I -- I -- I\nsee 1447(c) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction as being\nbroad enough to comfortably take in the situation where\nthe State law claims not really within the subject\nmatter of the district court's power are determined\ninappropriate for that court to hear and sent back.\nAnd it would bring us that much closer to\nrealizing the purpose of the review bar that has existed\nsince 1887, taking a category of cases out of the\njurisdiction of the circuit courts.\nI -- I had wanted to offer the Court some\nstatistics, as maybe proof-of-law professors might,\nabout the number of cases that are heard on this type of\nappeal. I can say that the cases that we found in our\nfootnotes 18 through 20 represent something close to the\nuniverse of cases in which discretion was found to be\nabused. And that abuse of discretion is nowhere near as\negregious as the legal errors that a district court\nmight commit in making erroneous judgments that it has\nno jurisdiction which were nonetheless subjected to the\nreview bar in Kircher and Powerex.\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nstop now.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nThank you. Mr. Rhodes, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RHODES: I just had a few quick points I\nwould like to bring up.\nFirst, I would just like to reiterate that\nwhen Congress enacted 1367, that gave it Article III\njurisdiction in those matters, just as 1331 and 1332 do.\nI would also like to reiterate that -- that stare\ndecisis should be maintained over this statutory\ninterpretation because it has proved to be workable\nrather than not workable.\nAgain, the circuit courts -- even though as\nMr. Chief Justice has iterated that they have to follow\nthis, they have found it to be a workable framework.\nAnd, again, as the Court expressed in Powerex, they\nagreed that in Quackenbush that Thermtron was not\naltered. And Congress has -- has seemingly ratified\nthis Court's interpretation in Thermtron, and it has\nbeen applied in Quackenbush.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose, though,\nif it would be an abuse of discretion for the district\ncourt to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is --\nthere never was jurisdiction, right? You said they have\ndiscretion to exercise or not. If it turns out they\ndon't have discretion to exercise, you know, because\nit's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why\nwouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of\njurisdiction?\nMR. RHODES: My response to that, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is that until a court decides that it was an\nabuse of discretion, the district court had jurisdiction\nunder 1367(c) to either exercise that power or not\nexercise that power.\nAnd unless there's any further questions for\nme, I ask that the brief -- this be remanded to the\nFederal circuit to decide on the merits of the appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
