        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will hear argument\nin United States against the White Mountain Apache Tribe.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn 1960, Congress declared the former Fort\nApache military post to be held in trust for the White\nMountain Apache Tribe. The specific --\nQUESTION: What condition was it in in 1960?\nWas it basically like it is today, or has it gotten worse?\nWhat was it like then?\nMR. GARRE: Well, it -- it's certainly much\nolder today. It's about 40 years older today. The\ncondition the -- the legislative history doesn't discuss\nthe condition of the fort in particular detail.\nIt's important to recognize that the military\nfort was built for temporary use -- today, some -- almost\na century ago, and in 1960 had been built for temporary\nuse, you know, more than 50, 60, or 70 years ago. So it\nwouldn't at all have been surprising if there had been a\nstate of decay in 1960.\nAnd of course, when Congress passed the 1960\nstatute, there was no indication at all -- certainly not\non the face of the statute, or in the legislative history\nthat's contained in respondent's lodging -- that it had in\nmind a historic preservation goal, or that it had in mind\nthat -- that it would require the Secretary of the\nInterior to undertake the enormous financial\nresponsibility of having to restore a century-old fort.\nQUESTION: -- making use today of a portion of\nthe structures there for the school and administrative\nneeds?\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.\nThe -- the vast majority of the buildings and historic\ndistrict area of Fort Apache are used today for school and\nadministrative purposes.\nQUESTION: Are those maintained in some fashion\nfor that use by the Federal Government?\nMR. GARRE: They are. As we point out in note 1\nof our reply brief, the Department of the Interior has\nspent more than $3 million over the past decade or\n15 years on repair and maintenance projects at the fort.\nIt's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in\nhistoric restoration efforts at the fort with the support\nof the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the\nInterior, and with the assistance of private, State, and\neven -- in some cases -- Federal tax dollars.\nQUESTION: Well, the U.S. Government does hold\nthe property in trust for the tribe -- the White Mountain\nTribe. Right?\nMR. GARRE: That's true. Just like the U.S.\nGovernment --\nQUESTION: And what basic responsibility does\nthat entail, would you say, the fact that the Government\nis a trustee?\nMR. GARRE: Well, when Congress places land in\ntrust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that\nthis Court has recognized. First, it places a restraint\non the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes\nthe property from State taxation. And if you look at\npages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates\nthat in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do\nwith Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the\nDepartment to have Congress place the land in trust so\nthat it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding\nreservation lands.\nNow, we know from the first Mitchell decision\ndecided by this Court that simply placing property in\ntrust does not in itself create a substantive right to\nmoney damages.\nQUESTION: But there was an enormous difference\nin that case in that the Indians managed the land. Under\nthe General Allotments Act, the idea was to make the\nindividual owner autonomous. Here, I think it's not\ndisputed that this land has been operated by the U.S.\nGovernment, and the U.S. Government has exclusive control.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, that -- that may\nbe true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act -- that is,\nthat the Federal Government is using the property, but the\n1960 act -- quite unlike the General Allotment Act --\nspecifically reserves to the Government the right to use\nthe property for Government uses. And in that respect, we\nthink the trust relationship created by the statute in\nthis case is much more limited than the one that was\ncreated by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of\nfactual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a\ndamages action under the Tucker Act.\nQUESTION: Can you just explain one small point\nto -- to me? I know what \"school purpose\" means. What is\n\"administrative\"? Is that administrative in connection\nwith the school, or some free-floating administration?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I -- I think generally, the\n\"administrative use\" can refer to executive uses, and is a\nvery broad term. In that respect, I think it's\ninstructive that Congress used that term. Nevertheless,\nI think that -- that \"administrative purposes\" has to be\nread with school purposes, and can be read to refer to\nboth uses for storage and the like, and also for\nadministrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian\nAffairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or -- or on\nthe surrounding reservation. So in that respect, it's\nadministrative for the purpose of the Department of the\nInterior, who operates activities there through the local\nagent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\nNow --\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, is -- is any of the -- or\nlet me ask you an open-ended question. How much of the\nproperty which is the subject of this claim was within the\nGovernment's control throughout this period, and how much\nof it was not?\nMR. GARRE:\nthe vast majority, if not all, was -- well, that's not\ntrue. The -- the vast majority of the property has been\nwithin the Government's control, but it's important to\nrecognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for\nbuilding-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence\nof Federal use and control. And the tribe does have\naccess to the Fort Apache property. The tribe is there.\nThe tribe even has a -- a cultural museum that it operates\non the property. So it's -- it's not as though this is a\nFederal enclave --\nQUESTION: Well, is the tribe making -- is the\ntribe making a monetary claim with respect to property\nwhich it has had in its control, as distinct from the\nGovernment's, during this period?\nMR. GARRE: If you look at appendix A to the\ntribe's complaint, which -- which has a detailed building-\nby-building analysis of the ways in which the building\ndon't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say\nthe tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at\nFort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to\nbuildings over which the Federal Government is not -- have\nany active use or -- or control.\nBut we don't think that a damages action can be\nbrought against the United States based on some fact-\nbound, manipulable notion of Federal control.\nQUESTION: No. I -- I realize that. I realize\nthat.\nMR. GARRE: Under the Tucker Act -- and this\nCourt emphasized it in the Mitchell decisions, and it's\nemphasized it in other decisions -- a substantive right to\ndamages against the United States -- which, after all, is\na right to damages against the public fisc -- has to be\ngrounded in a source of substantive law.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- can we talk just for a\nmoment about the analogy? And we'll call it just that,\nthe area of private trusts.\nI -- I take it that usually a trustee, who has\nthe obligation to repair buildings for the beneficiaries\nso they don't fall into disrepair, does so at the\nbeneficiaries' expense.\nMR. GARRE: That -- that's true.\nQUESTION: And that -- that didn't seem to\nfigure into your argument. Again, it -- it struck me,\nas -- reading the briefs -- that that was an argument --\nyou don't really make that argument.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: Is that because the trustee here is\nboth the beneficiary -- is -- is a co-beneficiary of the\ntrust?\nMR. GARRE:\nthe typical common law trust, but the -- the most\nfundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think\nthat a court should have to plumb through the common law\nto determine whether or not Congress established a right\nto damages against the United States in this case.\nAnd it's also true -- if you look at the common\nlaw, the first thing you -- you're met with -- with -- is\nwith the general rule that you can't get breach of trust\ndamages against the sovereign. So you'd have to get --\nnot only you'd have to get around the courts --\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- but, I mean, that's\nthe whole purpose of the Tucker Act. I mean, to -- to\nplead sovereign immunity begs the question. That's\nexactly the question before us.\nMR. GARRE: Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia,\nand we think that that question should be answered by\nlooking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies,\nwhich is the 1960 act.\nQUESTION: Well, but it would have seemed to me,\nfollowing Justice Scalia's question and my own, that if\nthe law of trusts gave a clear indication one way or the\nother that there was a liability, then the Tucker Act\nanalysis might -- might be different accordingly.\nMR. GARRE: With respect, I disagree. And I\nthink the Mitchell I case establishes that. In\nMitchell I, both the Court of Claims and the dissenters on\nthis Court reasoned that because the General Allotment Act\nplaced land, quote, in trust, that therefore one could\nlook to the common law and therefore one could import into\nthe Tucker Act all the liabilities that would follow\nagainst a private trustee, even liabilities that would\nresult in damages actions. A majority of this Court\nrejected that analysis.\nNow, in Mitchell II, the Court specifically\naffirmed the result in Mitchell I, and it emphasized that\nMitchell II was different because in that case, the Court\nhad statutes and regulations that created specific\nmanagement duties that could be fairly interpreted as\nmandating the payment of compensation for the breach of\nthose duties.\nNow, the court of appeals recognized at page 18a\nof the petition appendix -- and the -- even the tribe\nrecognizes on page 11 of its brief -- that the 1960 act\ndoesn't set forth any specific management duties on the\npart of the Government.\nQUESTION: Do you think the Government could\nhave just destroyed the property or the structures on the\nland?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I -- Justice Stevens, I think\nthat the notion that the Government would destroy the\nproperty, if it did so in a way that was clearly\ninconsistent with the terms of the act --\nQUESTION: Let me put it another way. Do you\nthink they had a duty not to destroy the property?\nMR. GARRE: That -- that duty, if it exists,\ncomes from ordinary tort principles and from principles of\njust compensation under the Fifth Amendment. And those\nclaims haven't been asserted in this case. This case\ninvolves a breach of trust action, a claim for damages\nbased on the alleged breach of trust which the tribe\ngrounds in the 1960 act, and --\nQUESTION: No, I understand. But part of the\nquestion we have is to what extent did the Government\nassume duties beyond immunizing the property from State\ntaxation and preventing its alienation. Did they have any\nadditional duties? And I'm not clear on whether you've\ntold me they had a duty not to destroy it or not.\nMR. GARRE: Not under -- under the 1960 act, the\nstatute in this case. Now, if the Government had --\nQUESTION: But did they -- from any source, did\nthey have a duty not to destroy it?\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think -- I think it would,\nJustice Stevens. If I could respond by -- by maybe\nrunning through some hypotheticals --\nQUESTION:\nno, to be honest with you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: Yes, it would under the Fifth\nAmendment to the Constitution if Congress sold the fort to\nsomeone else, or if Congress destroyed the fort. Then the\ntribe might have a claim for just compensation. The tribe\nhas referred to some just compensation cases in its brief,\nbut it hasn't brought a just compensation claim in this\ncase.\nThe tribe also might seek to bring a damages\naction under the Federal Torts Claimed Act -- Tort Claims\nAct for some kind of destruction of property. The tribe\nhasn't brought that --\nQUESTION: So you are -- to this extent, you're\ndiffering from counsel's position before the Federal\nCircuit, because I believe at that level, counsel was\nasked if the United States could dynamite all the\nbuildings to the ground with no liability to the tribe,\nand the answer was yes.\nMR. GARRE: Well, it's -- it's not clear to me\nthe context in which that question came up.\nBut I also think that it's true that if the\nSecretary decided that it was necessary to level a\nbuilding because it proves an attractive nuisance to\nschool children, or because it was desirable to build a\nmore -- newer and better educational facility at the fort,\nthat the 1960 act would authorize the Secretary to do\nthat.\nBut -- but we do recognize that there are other\nprinciples in this area stemming from the Fifth Amendment,\na source of substantive law, stemming possibly from the\nFederal Torts Claims Act, another source of substantive\nlaw, which aren't invoked in this case, which might be\nimplicated based on the Government's management of the\nproperty.\nQUESTION: Well, how about Mitchell II?\nMR. GARRE: Well, in Mitchell II, Justice\nO'Connor, the statutes and regulations there, which --\nwhich the Court described as a pervasive, statutory scheme\ngoverning Indian timber management, provided specific\nfiduciary management duties that could be fairly\ninterpreted as -- as mandating payment of compensation.\nThey -- they specifically govern the generation of profits\nor proceeds for the Indian tribe, and in that case, the\nCourt held that the violation of those duties, grounded in\na statute or regulation, gave rise to a money damages\naction under the Tucker Act. This case is --\nQUESTION: Well, how would -- how would you\ndescribe the duties the United States has as trustee with\nrelation to this property?\ntotal of its duties?\nMR. GARRE: I think the -- the principal duties\nare the ones that the Court has always recognized when it\nplaces land in trust: not to alienate the land and -- and\nit immunizes it from State taxation.\nQUESTION: In -- in effect, I think what you're\nsaying is that there are no trust duties. There's a\npeculiarity here. The word trust in -- as you're using it\nin the argument, simply has those two implications: don't\ngive it away and place it in a -- in a condition or -- or,\nby virtue of the word trust, it is in a condition to avoid\ntaxation.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: I think you're saying that there are\nno fiduciary duties beyond that. If there is any duty\nbeyond that, it's got to come from the Constitution, or\nit's got to come from a specific provision of -- of a\nstatute creating a duty not necessarily as -- as that of a\ntrustee, but simply as a statutory duty. Isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. GARRE: That's correct when the tribe comes\ninto court under the Tucker Act and asserts a claim for\nmonetary damages against the United States Treasury.\nWe're dealing against an area of sovereign immunity where\nthe United States is immune from damages for breach of\ntrust unless Congress --\nQUESTION: But I think you're saying two things,\nand they -- they mesh perfectly. One, you're making a\nsovereign immunity argument. Two, you're saying there is\nno trust responsibility whatsoever on the part of the\ntrustee except not to alienate.\nMR. GARRE: Not enforceable in an action for\nmonetary damages. Of course, in this area, the Court has\nrecognized --\nQUESTION: So you are conceding that there --\nthat there might be equitable remedies based on -- on a\ntheory of fiduciary duty?\nMR. GARRE: It's conceivable that there would be\nan equitable remedy based on a violation of statute, not\non equitable duties. This is -- this is a realm --\nQUESTION: So that if -- may -- may I just, you\nknow --\nMR. GARRE: Yes. Sorry.\nQUESTION: -- pursue the example that Justice\nStevens used? If the Government said, 30 days from now,\nwe are going to blow up all the buildings, there would be\na -- an -- an equitable remedy based upon fiduciary duty?\nMR. GARRE: I think in that situation, Justice\nSouter, the tribe might be able to bring an injunction --\ninjunctive action perhaps under the APA claiming that that\nuse of the property, the destruction of it, would exceed\nthe scope of the Government's use right under the 1960\nact.\nQUESTION: Well, is that -- I -- I don't\nunderstand what you're saying.\nMR. GARRE: That -- that would be under statute,\nnot on some --\nQUESTION: So -- so you're saying that would not\nbe based on fiduciary responsibility?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: If -- if it exceeded the Government's\nuse right, what -- what other obligation -- what would be\nthe source of -- of a -- of an obligation if -- if it was\nnot fiduciary duty?\nMR. GARRE: I think it could be a property\ninterest as well. I mean, we acknowledge that the 1968 --\nthe 1960 act gives this tribe --\nQUESTION: But the property interest takes into\nconsideration the trust relationship, doesn't it?\nMR. GARRE: Well, it doesn't necessarily have\nto. The Court has had many cases brought by Indian tribes\nclaiming just compensation under the Fifth Amendment of --\nof property, which -- at least in some management -- some\naspects would have a trust in it. Overlapping all this\narea is the notion that the Government has political and\nmoral responsibility to the Indian tribes, and the Court\nhas recognized that throughout its decisions since --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- just -- just to put\nJustice Souter's question back before you -- and my own:\nWhat trust duties does the United States have in addition\nto not alienating the property, and making sure that it's\nimmune from State taxation? I think your answer is it has\nno fiduciary obligations at all. There may be some\nobligations under the Fifth Amendment to protect property,\net cetera, but as a trustee, it has no fiduciary\nobligations other than the ones that are mentioned.\nMR. GARRE: The United States has general\nfiduciary obligations to the Indian tribes that this\nCourt has recognized. But the Court has never\nrecognized -- and I think it rejected the notion in the\nMitchell I case that --\nQUESTION: Well, but do those general\nobligations with reference to this property import any\nduty other than the duty not to alienate and to ensure\nthat it's immune from State taxation?\nMR. GARRE: Not a duty and certainly not a duty\nthat's enforceable in an action for monetary damages.\nQUESTION: Well, I would have thought there\nmight well be a duty for the trustee -- the U.S.\nGovernment acting as trustee here -- not to lay waste to\nthe property held in trust for the tribe --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- not to affirmatively lay waste to\nit or -- or allow something to happen that just the\nordinary care would suggest should not happen.\nMR. GARRE: Justice O'Connor, that duty\ncertainly is not expressed in the terms of the 1960\nstatute, and -- and, of course, there are other\nstatutory --\nQUESTION: Well, except to the extent that the\nstatute does say, all right, this property, Fort Apache,\nis to be held by the U.S. Government in trust for the\ntribe. And maybe that conveys some notion, in addition to\nnot alienating it, not laying waste to it. Now, whether\nwhat's done fits that I don't know. Maybe ordinary wear\nand tear isn't covered, but --\nMR. GARRE: I -- I don't think that that\nposition would be consistent with the Court's ruling in\nMitchell I, where the Court rejected the notion that the\nuse of language, in trust, subjects the United States to\nall the liabilities of a private trustee.\nQUESTION: Well, there's a little more here than\nwas true in Mitchell I. It's specific property, hold it\nin trust, and the Government can use it for a school or\nadministrative needs, but there -- there's something more\nthan was in Mitchell I.\nMR. GARRE: With respect, I think that there --\nthere's less, Justice O'Connor, that -- that Congress\nspecifically carved out of the trust relationship the\nright of the Government to use the property for the\nGovernment's purposes.\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, there -- there is one\nsignificant difference, and that is the control element.\nMitchell I stressed that the control was with the\nallottee. Mitchell II has a whole paragraph that says\nwhat's key is who has control. And as I read it, it was\nthat these specific instructions were an indication that\nthe U.S. had exclusive control, but that the real thing\nwas the control, who has control of this property.\nMR. GARRE: But -- but there's a key difference,\nJustice Ginsburg, between this case and Mitchell II with\nrespect to the question of control. In Mitchell II, the\nCourt emphasized throughout its decision and -- and\ndiscussed the statutes and regulations in detail for more\nthan four pages. The control stemmed from specific\nstatutory and regulatory duties that were created by\nCongress in that case, and the Court found that the\nviolation of those specific duties, which could be\nfairly -- fairly interpreted as mandating compensation,\ngave rise to a damages claim against the United States.\nIn this case, the tribe can't point to a single\nstatute or regulation, and the only statute it relies in\nthis case -- in this Court is the 1960 act that creates\nany --\nQUESTION: Well, then you're -- you're reading\nit differently than I have just set it out. As I take the\nCourt to have said control is key, and these specific\nregulations show that there is indeed control, that the\nUnited States runs the show. But the nature of this\ntrust, there wouldn't be any instructions. You wouldn't\nexpect there to be detailed instructions. The question is\nwho was in control.\nMR. GARRE: Well, there -- there is no specific\nmanagement duty in this case. Instead of the situation in\nMitchell I or Mitchell II, Congress gave --\nQUESTION: Can I interrupt with just one -- one\nquestion? The trust here refers not only to the land but\nto the improvements. Doesn't that make a difference? In\na -- in a private situation wouldn't that normally create\nin the -- the trustee a duty to ensure against fire, and\nto take care of the improvements as opposed to just bare\nlegal title to the property?\nMR. GARRE: It -- it might, Justice Stevens, but\nI think the reference to that also is important in terms\nof Congress' express delegation to the Secretary the duty\nto use all of the trust property, the land and the\nbuildings, to operate an Indian school there, which is\nthe -- the use that -- that the property had been put\nsince the 1920s.\nQUESTION: So in your -- in your opinion, if\nthis statute had added the words, and if the Government\ndoes take control, it shall use ordinary prudence and\nskill to preserve the property, then they'd have a claim.\nMR. GARRE: It -- it certainly would be a\nmuch --\nQUESTION: Is that yes or no.\nMR. GARRE: -- different case.\nQUESTION: No. Yes or no.\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think -- if I can analyze\nthat claim. I -- I think they -- they might have a claim,\nJustice Breyer.\nQUESTION: When you say might, I'm just\nimagining the same statute, everything that's gone on this\nmorning, and it says if they take control, they shall use\nordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property.\nMR. GARRE: The --\nQUESTION: The answer then is yes or no?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think it would be no,\nJustice Breyer, and if I could explain why.\nQUESTION: It would be no even then. Then what\nhave we been arguing about --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- because, I mean, everybody has\nbeen asking you whether that can be implied here? And my\nimpression was you said yes. I mean, if it --\nMR. GARRE: Congress creates a number of duties.\nAnd Congress has legislative -- of course, in the area of\nhistoric preservation, and it creates duties that the\ncourts below found are procedural in nature.\nQUESTION: And so if they said, and by the way,\nif in fact they take control, the trustee -- i.e., the\nUnited States -- has a duty when they take control to use\nordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property.\nMR. GARRE: Then the statute -- they would --\nthey would have a specific management duty. And then the\nquestion --\nQUESTION: And so the answer is then they would\nhave -- they could -- then they'd win. Right? If it said\nthat.\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think they might under that\nsituation.\nQUESTION: Okay, fine.\nMR. GARRE: But there's a second question under\nthe Court's cases that the Court would have to answer it,\nand that's case two, and that's whether or not that\nspecific statutory duty can be fairly interpreted as\nmandating the payment of compensation.\nQUESTION: And it adds, and indeed if they\nviolate this, they have to pay a lot of money.\nMR. GARRE: Of -- of course, in that situation.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then we're all right.\nMR. GARRE: Of course, in that situation --\nQUESTION: So our issue here -- what I'm getting\nat is our issue then is whether that word control implies\nthose latter words --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that were, in fact, left out.\nThat's the question. Is that right or not?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think it's the question\nbecause the word control doesn't appear anywhere in the\nface of the statute.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I -- I was reading --\nit's subject to the right of the Secretary of Interior to\nuse any part of the land in improvements.\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nQUESTION: So I -- we have to decide right to\nuse -- does that imply those words that are left out.\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nQUESTION: It didn't say he had to use it, did\nit?\nMR. GARRE: No, not at all.\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: So in order to say he controlled it,\nyou -- you would have to say he --\nQUESTION: I misspoke. I'm sorry to have mixed\npeople up.\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nQUESTION: I meant right to use. Does it imply\nthe words that are not there when they use it?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. And -- and I think -- and if I\ncould be more clear, I think that we think the Court's\ncases and the Tucker Act -- and -- and we think can also\nlook to cases in the section 1983 context -- establishes a\ntwo-step inquiry. First, has Congress created a specific\nduty on the Government's part, and second, can that duty\nbe fairly interpreted as mandating a payment of\ncompensation breached?\nQUESTION: How does it work in other areas of\nreal estate law, where suppose I turn my beach house over\nto a friend and he has a wild party and destroys it? Do I\nhave a claim against him if I had no knowledge he would do\nsuch a thing?\nMR. GARRE: Conceivably you might have a tort\nclaim, Justice Breyer, but that's not a claim that's --\nQUESTION:\ngive or lease or give property to other people if they\nwreck the place, contrary to expectation, we imply into\nthose promises or words that they had to take reasonable\ncare?\nMR. GARRE: Possibly as a breach of a contract\nor a tort --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. GARRE: -- violation.\nQUESTION: If we normally do that in the law,\nwhy would we not do the same thing here where, indeed, in\naddition to what you normally have, you have this word\ntrust and special relationship?\nMR. GARRE: I think the Court refused to do that\nin the Mitchell I case because there, the Court used the\nlanguage, in trust, and it refused to --\nQUESTION: Well, it wasn't a question of laying\nwaste in Mitchell I, was it? It was just a question of\nnot using the land to its utmost financial benefit.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true, Justice Scalia.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: So the question he's asking you is --\nis destroying the land.\nYou say in your -- you quote in your brief\nAustin on trusts to the effect that there is a fundamental\ndifference between a private trust and a public trust.\nWhat -- what kind of cases is -- is that -- is that\nsection referring to?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, suppose I leave my -- my\nhouse to the City of Falls Church in trust for the people\nof Falls Church. What -- what obligations are imposed on\nthe City of Falls Church?\nMR. GARRE: I think what the -- I mean, there\nyou might have a situation where the question is whether\nyou could enforce obligations against a private individual\nwho left it in trust. Here we're talking about a\nsituation where the --\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm talking about\nimposing -- what obligations are imposed upon Falls\nChurch.\nMR. GARRE: You could impose -- you could --\nQUESTION: I leave property to Falls Church in\ntrust for the people of Falls Church or in trust for some\ncategory of the -- of the people of Falls Church.\nMR. GARRE: I think the Restatement\nprovisions --\nQUESTION: The Little League or something.\nMR. GARRE: -- that we referred to incorporate\nthe doctrine of sovereign immunity in this area, and you\ncould impose possibly injunctive --\nQUESTION: Oh, is that all that -- that Scott on\ntrusts was referring to, just the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: Because if that's all he was\nreferring to, you know, that's been waived by -- by the\nstatute here.\nMR. GARRE: No.\nQUESTION: I thought there was something quite\ndifferent he was referring to, that the whole nature of a\npublic trust is different from a private trust. If that's\nnot the case, then all of that is quite irrelevant it\nseems to me.\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think it's both, Justice\nScalia, that the public trust is different in that we\ndon't ordinarily assume that the Government acts in all\nits capacities as a private trustee. And that's certainly\ntrue in the Indian law context. This Court -- there are\nmore than 56 million acres of land that the Government\nholds in trust. If the Court assumed just by Congress'\nuse of the word in trust, the Government had assumed all\nthe liabilities of -- of a common law trustee, then that\nwould be an enormous potential liability that there's no\nindication whatsoever Congress ever agreed to assume.\nQUESTION: Okay, Mr. Garre. You're -- you're\narguing that you can't infer from the use of the word\ntrust that all of the obligations and all of the potential\nliabilities of a private trustee are carried by it. But\nyour argument seems to go, if I understand it, to the\nother extreme, that the use of the word trust seems to\nimply no obligation and no responsibility unless it is\nfollowed by a specific delineation of what those\nresponsibilities are.\nAnd my question is -- Justice Breyer a minute\nago was saying, well, what would be different if we added\ncertain words. And my question is what would we -- be\ndifferent if we subtracted certain words on your theory?\nWhat if the statute had not included the words, in trust?\nWouldn't your argument be exactly the same?\nMR. GARRE: Under the Tucker Act -- and, of\ncourse, the Tucker Act doesn't refer to claims for breach\nof trust.\nQUESTION: No, but would you answer my question?\nWouldn't you be -- aren't you making the same argument\nunder a statute that says in trust that you would be\nmaking under a statute that did not include the words, in\ntrust, at all? Isn't that so?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. That -- that's true, Justice\nSouter. But I -- I think --\nQUESTION:\nwith the usual canon of construction that we assume that\nCongress does not use useless words?\nMR. GARRE: Those words had great effect here.\nThey had the same effect that the words have -- this\nCourt has recognized -- with respect to the alienation of\nland and with respect to immunization of land to State\ntaxation.\nQUESTION: Yes. They -- they couldn't alienate\nunder a statute that says the -- the land and et cetera\nwill be held by the United States for the tribe. Taxes\ncouldn't be levied by lesser sovereigns against lands held\nby the United States under those circumstances.\nMR. GARRE: Those -- those --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that the word, in\ntrust, means nothing.\nMR. GARRE: No. With respect, I would disagree.\nIt has those two settled consequences. We know from\npages 6 and 7 --\nQUESTION: But why would you not have those\nconsequences without those words? It's true if you have\nthose words, the consequences follow. But wouldn't the\nconsequences follow without the words?\nMR. GARRE: No.\nQUESTION: And if in fact that's all the\nGovernment -- if that's all Congress was getting at, why\ndidn't Congress simply say that instead of using the\nphrase, in trust, that normally carries enormous\nimplications?\nMR. GARRE: The -- that -- that line of argument\nis the argument that we think that the court of appeal --\nthe Court of Claims made in Mitchell I and that the\ndissenters made in Mitchell I, and we think that the\nmajority of the Court rejected --\nQUESTION: And -- and Justice Ginsburg has\nsuggested that maybe the -- the significance of that line\nof argument depends on whether there was or was not\ncontrol. But I think --\nMR. GARRE: In the factual sense.\nQUESTION: -- on your argument, I think what\nyou're telling us is that Mitchell I -- and in any event\nyour argument -- has the implication that those words add\nabsolutely nothing.\nMR. GARRE: No, no, Justice Souter. That's not\nthe implication of our argument. They do have the\naccepted meanings. The United States holds land in trust.\nIt is immunized from State taxation. If the tribe itself\nheld it or private Indians held it, it wouldn't be\nsubject -- it would be subject to State taxation.\nQUESTION: What if the Government of the United\nStates held it?\nMR. GARRE: Well, it does in this case, and\nthat's the significance of holding it in trust.\nQUESTION: Yes, and it -- and it would do so\nunder the statute if the words, in trust, weren't used.\nMR. GARRE: That -- that -- it also has -- in\nthis case it has the effect of making the lands here like\nthe surrounding reservation lands. And -- and again, I\nthink pages 6 and 7 of the tribe's lodging helps to make\nthat point.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brauchli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. BRAUCHLI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf the Secretary of the Interior had never taken\ncontrol of these buildings, we would not be here. It\nwould be a -- a bare trust. Simply putting these\nbuildings in trust does not create any fiduciary\nobligations.\nBut the Secretary did take control. It's not\nmandatory; it's voluntary. And that's why this case is\nexactly like Mitchell II. In Mitchell I, there's no nexus\nbetween the General Allotment Act and managing a forest.\nBut when you look at the forest management statute,\nthere's a direct nexus from the forest management statutes\nto control of the forest, and when you control the forest,\nto the exclusion of the tribe, then you are responsible as\na fiduciary.\nQUESTION: But the control -- the control here\nwas not control given for the benefit of the tribe. To\nthe contrary, it was control given for the United States'\nown use. It seems to me that's -- that's quite different.\nI agree that if -- if you -- you say the United States\nshall control it for the benefit of -- of the tribe, you\nmight have a different case. But that's not what this\nstatute said. It said the United States shall control it\nfor its -- its use, running an Indian school and so forth.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Justice Scalia, I respectfully\ndisagree.\nQUESTION: Administrative purposes.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: The -- the benefit to the\ntribe -- Congress stripped the United States of all fee\nsimple, absolute title and gave 100 percent beneficial\ntitle to the tribe. The United States has no retention of\nownership whatsoever. They have a use easement, and\nthat's all they have. A very limited right. And the\nbenefit is what Congress said, and Congress said, we're\ngoing to take this fort, which we established to kill\nApaches and imprison them, and we're going to give it to\nthe White Mountain Apache Tribe. And they gave it, and it\nhas value. It has 35 buildings. It has 7,500 acres. Now\nit's only -- you know, we're down. We're talking\nabout 288 acres.\nQUESTION: I thought the fort was to protect\nwhite settlers. But you -- you know, you can describe it\nthe way you like.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, it was to protect white\nsettlers --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: -- but from my clients'\nviewpoint, it was established to conquer them. So that's\nwhat I'm here for, my client.\nQUESTION: Yes, I understand.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: And there was a benefit. And\nthe -- the benefit said -- it's been postponed because the\nUnited States Secretary reserved a very limited right to\nuse it for a school --\nQUESTION: I -- I want to make I understand your\nargument. If the Government had, after this statute was\nenacted, said, you know, we really don't have any interest\nat all in these buildings, and just let them go to waste,\nbut they didn't use them in any way, there would be no\nliability?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Absolutely none. Before\nMarch 18, 1960, they could have --\nQUESTION: Why? I mean, what -- what kind of a\ntheory is that? If -- if the Government occupies the\nbuildings and -- and by that preserves them in a small\nsense, they're falling apart, but at least it's better\nthan a complete -- complete abandonment, they're liable,\nbut if they completely abandon them, they're not. I -- I\njust don't understand that.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Justice Kennedy, if I understood\nyour question, I thought you meant before March 18, 1960\nwhen they owned it --\nQUESTION: No, no. I mean after 1960.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Oh.\nQUESTION: I thought your initial argument was\nthat after 1960, once the Government took control by,\ni.e. -- by that I thought you meant possessing the\nbuildings --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Occupying.\nQUESTION: -- it had a duty, but that if it had\nnot possessed the buildings or occupied the buildings, it\nwould have no duty.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes, that is true. That's what\nI'm saying. The -- the fact is that they occupied --\nQUESTION:\nMR. BRAUCHLI: They occupied and physically\ncontrolled the buildings. If -- for instance, we are not\nfiling a claim for the four buildings. There's only 4\nbuildings out of 35 being used for a school right now.\nThe -- four. And so we're not filing a claim for those,\nand they just -- they just sprang for 3 and a half million\ndollars to fix those up. But the other buildings that\nthey have used and occupied and destroyed and -- and\nsome -- they've demolished four -- those are the buildings\nthat we have a claim for.\nAnd we say we're not charging you for trespass.\nWe're not charging you for reasonable wear and tear,\nbut --\nQUESTION: Well, since 1960, did the U.S. use\nsome of the buildings other than it's now using?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes, and the reason that they\nhave fallen off from use is because the enrollment went\nfrom 500 students down to about 80.\nQUESTION: Well, if there are 35 buildings on\nthe premises, how many did the Government use since 1960?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: The Government used all of the\nbuildings. They physically occupied them.\nQUESTION: All of them.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes, they did, and they used them\nfor storage and for schools.\nQUESTION: Since 1960.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes. And so it's been under the\nexclusive control. But as --\nQUESTION: And now it physically occupies 4 of\nthe 35.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Four for school and about six for\nits administrative use.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brauchli, would you give me your\nview on the hypothetical that I asked your -- your\ncolleague on the other side? Suppose I leave property to\nthe City of Falls Church. The City of Falls Church takes\npossession. It's not occupied by anybody else. And\nit's -- it's in trust for the people of Falls Church. The\nCity of Falls Church takes possession. It doesn't do\nanything with the land. It just leaves it there. Now, in\nthe law of trusts, that -- that would be wasteful, and the\ntrustee would have to use the land in order to generate\nincome for the people of Falls Church, or at least do\nsomething for the people of Falls Church.\nDo you think the City of Falls Church would be\nin breach of trust? Do you know of any lawsuits against\ncities or any public entities that -- that have accepted\nland or other property in trust?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: If -- if the land is being -- as\nI understand the question, you -- you are leaving this to\nFalls Church and as a beneficiary --\nQUESTION: It's a lot. It's a great big lot,\nand I say, you know, I'd like to leave it to the City of\nFalls Church and I do. And the City of Falls Church\ndoesn't do anything with it, just leaves it there. It\ncould have built a -- you know, an apartment building and\ngotten a lot of income for the city coffers. It could\nhave built a baseball diamond or whatever. It just leaves\nthe lot there.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: That is not our situation --\nQUESTION: Is that a lawsuit?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: I don't know because --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's crucial to your case\nhere --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: I don't --\nQUESTION: -- it seems to me.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, I don't think --\nQUESTION: I think it goes to the point of\nwhether a public trust is the same thing as a private\ntrust.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, this is a private trust.\nI think this is a private trust, and it's not a public\ntrust. But it's --\nQUESTION: Even if it were, I guess the real\nanalogy would be it goes to the City of Falls Church to be\nheld in trust for the public to be used as a school for as\nlong as they want it, and thereafter to go to the\narcheological society for preservation. And now they run\nit down as a school, and the question would be can the\narcheological society now sue them for the loss. I don't\nknow. Maybe it can.\nQUESTION: Well, this -- this doesn't say that\nit goes to the archeological society --\nQUESTION: It goes to the tribe.\nQUESTION: -- or that it goes to the Indians\nafterwards. It just says, in trust.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Justice Scalia, I think you're\nsaying that -- you're talking about a situation where the\nbeneficiary doesn't do anything with the property. If\nthe -- if the -- I think the analogy would be -- that\nyou're making is if the White Mountain Apache Tribe did\nnothing to their property. Then that's their choice. But\nif you as the trustee went in there and destroyed the\nproperty that you were going to give to the --\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about destroying it.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: -- beneficiary of Falls Church,\nthat's our situation.\nQUESTION: Yes.\naside. I'm -- I'm just saying that the City of Falls\nChurch doesn't do anything with it. It does not do what a\ntrustee would normally have to do, and that is produce\nincome from it, or -- or use it in -- in some way that\nwill benefit the -- the cestui que trust. Okay? It just\nleaves it fallow.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: And they're a trustee.\nQUESTION: And -- and I don't know of any\nlawsuits in which in such a situation a citizen could say,\nyou know, I'm -- I'm a citizen of Falls Church, and you\nare wasting my -- my trust estate.\nQUESTION: No. I don't even know of one that\nsays I have my forest which I leave to the people of Falls\nChurch, and lo and behold, 20 years later, that forest is\na wreck. They cut every tree. And I don't know if the\ncitizens of Falls Church can sue there either, but I know\nthe Indians can.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: I don't -- I think there's a\ndifferent -- there's -- this Court unanimously last term\nin the Klamath case said that the fiduciary relationship,\nthe trust relationship, between the United States and the\ntribes is the primary cornerstone of Indian law. It was a\nunanimous opinion. There's a special trust relationship\nbetween the Indian people and the United States Government\nand when the United States --\nQUESTION: But does that -- does that extend to\na requirement that the United States spend its monies\nrather than the tribe's monies to preserve the land?\nSuppose in this case that some basic erosion systems were\nneeded because the land was eroding, endangering the --\nthe topography, and some simple irrigation rivulets or --\nor drainage rivulets would -- would save the property.\nWould the United States have the obligation to perform\nthose -- those repairs?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes. Yes, they do.\nQUESTION: At its expense?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes.\nQUESTION: What -- what authority do you have\nfor that?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Because they --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's certainly not a -- a\ntrustee doesn't have the duty to repair at his own expense\nin -- in a private trust.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, this is not a -- I -- the\nUnited States, if they are -- the beneficiary is the\ntribe, and I think when you have a trustee in control and\noccupying, they -- according to the treatises I read --\nread, there's an absolute obligation to protect and\npreserve the beneficiary.\nQUESTION:\nThat's the point. The -- the trust itself has to provide\nthe means, the -- the financial wherewithal to make those\nrepairs. This isn't a duty financially imposed on the\ntrustee.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, I just disagree with that.\nWhen the United States is the trustee --\nQUESTION: Well, you'd have to have some\nauthority. You may disagree, but how -- how do you find\nit out of trust law?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Okay. My authority is the\nMitchell II which was a waste case as well as a benefits\ncase because in that case, there was a requirement to\nmanage the forest on a sustained yield basis, and if --\nQUESTION: All right. If your --\nQUESTION: Waste -- waste is different.\nQUESTION: If your answer to me --\nQUESTION: Waste is different from doing\nsomething that costs money, and the money has to come from\nsomewhere. And -- and do you think the United States\ncould sell off a piece of this to private hands in order\nto obtain the money to renovate these buildings?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: No, but they did appropriate\nmoney --\nQUESTION: So you're -- you're urging then that\nordinary trust law does not apply in the case of a public\ntrust.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, I think that the trust\nrelationship between the United States and Indian tribes\nis sui generis.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: You cannot import the common law\nwholesale into a -- this type of situation.\nQUESTION: Based on your answer you gave to me\nabout the hypothetical about the erosion occurring, it --\nit would seem to me that if the United States has an\naffirmative duty in that case, the fact that it occupied\nor didn't occupy the buildings does not alter its duty to\nkeep those buildings in repair. Its occupancy and use has\nnothing to do with the case --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well --\nQUESTION: -- because in my hypothetical they\ndidn't occupy or use the land.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, the complaint is for -- for\ndamage to the infrastructure for failure to keep up the --\nthe water and sewer system, the electrical system, as well\nas the buildings that they used and controlled. They had\ntotal, exclusive control.\nQUESTION: But if they didn't -- in Justice\nKennedy's question, if the United States didn't use it for\nadministrative and school purposes, then the United\nStates, under the terms of the trust, has no right to hold\nit because they have this exclusive right of occupancy\nonly for those purposes. And if they just let the -- then\nit would be -- wouldn't it belong to the tribe?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: It expires and they -- they said\nthat in the court of appeals below that the -- the circuit\njudges said, well, can you use it as a uranium dump? And\nthe Department of Justice said, no, because that would be\na breach of the trust because we're only allowed to use it\nfor school or administrative purposes. Therefore, a\nuranium dump would be outside the use allowed.\nI think waste is a use outside what Congress\nallowed them, and it's a specific use and it should be\nconstrued against the easement. The easements are not\nwide open.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I'm not sure you confront\nthe question, and I'm not sure what the answer is. If the\nwaste -- duty to protect waste requires spending some\nmoney, whose money do you spend? The trustee's or the\ntrust's? The beneficiary's money or the trustee's money?\nIf you buy an insurance policy, does the trustee pay for\nout of his own pocket or out of trust assets?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, I think in this case the\nUnited States was obligated to prevent the deterioration.\nAll they have to do is repair -- they have\nbasketball-sized holes in the roof letting rain in which\nprogressively deteriorates -- deteriorates the property.\nQUESTION: Could the United States have used\ntrust assets to perform that duty?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: I think they should use their own\nassets since they're using it rent-free, and they should\nprotect the property because they have --\nQUESTION: You're saying they should use it.\nCould they -- in your judgment, could the United States\nhave used trust assets to perform that duty?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes, the United States' assets.\nI'm -- are you -- I'm not --\nQUESTION: That's not my question.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Oh, you mean the trust assets.\nYou mean the buildings themselves? I don't -- well, they\nhave collected rents --\nQUESTION: Could they cut --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: -- for some of the buildings.\nQUESTION: Could they cut down some trees and\nsay, we're going to sell off some timber because we've got\nto raise some money to fix the roof? Would that have been\na -- a legitimate use of the property?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Of the tribe's timber?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BRAUCHLI:\nwithout the tribe's permission.\nQUESTION: So it's literally got to come out of\na pocket of the National Government which has no relation\nto the tribe's assets is what you're saying.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: That's what I'm saying.\nQUESTION: Suppose you -- you rent -- it's\nrather interesting. I mean, suppose -- suppose that the\ntrustee -- this were an ordinary trust, but the trustee\nwas giving it to a third party to use, which he'd have the\nright to do under the trust. And the third party didn't\nrepair the basketball-sized holes in the pavilion. How do\nwe decide if it's that third party's responsibility, or if\ntrust assets should have been used? I mean, here I'm\nthinking that --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well --\nQUESTION: -- the trustee is both the trustee\nand the third party himself because he's using it for his\nown purposes.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, under landlord and tenant\nlaw, the tenant would certainly be liable for the waste,\nand this Court said that in the Bostwick case.\nQUESTION: Would the tenant have to repair the\nholes in the roof?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: The tenant would be responsible.\nAny lease of tribal property by a -- a tenant, the -- the\nduty is to the United States as well as the tribe. And\nthe United States under the leasing regulations has an\nabsolute duty to go in there and protect the -- to protect\nthe value of the property -- and I put that in my brief --\nthe value of the property from a tenant who's injuring\nthat property. So here they're saying we're like a\ntenant, but we can commit all the waste we want to.\nQUESTION: What precisely are you asking for?\nYou said -- you started to say something, and then you\nwere asked a question. You said you're not asking for\nwear and tear. What is the measure of the damages\nyou're --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: I think the measure of damages\nwould be against the measuring stick of a reasonable\ntrustee in like circumstances in total control of the\ntrust corpus of his beneficiary. And I'm saying it's that\namount of damages necessary to bring it up to code, less\nreasonable wear and tear.\nQUESTION: So it would be -- that -- that would\nbe the -- 14 million-dollar figure to bring it up to code?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, that was been altered\nbecause the tribe has engaged in a little self-help, and\nwe actually took over five -- five buildings, and we had a\ngrant from the White House Save America's Treasures and\nthe National Endowment of the Humanities and the State of\nArizona, and the tribe put 2 million of their own dollars.\nSo I think that figure is more like $8 million, and\nthat's --\nQUESTION: But you're still -- what you're\ntalking about is what it would cost to bring this up to\nhistoric building preservation level?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Not necessarily. Its just a --\nwhen you have -- not -- we're not talking about restoring\nit. We're talking about rehabilitating the buildings and\nyou can keep its historic character and make modifications\nto it. We're not talking about restoring it and making it\ninto a theme park like the Government suggests. We're\ntalking about bringing it up to code. You can make some\nmodifications to it.\nThe -- the standards are -- the Secretary's\nstandard says if you're going to have properties listed on\nthe National Register of Historic Properties, you can make\nmodifications, but you have to keep the historic\ncharacter. You can upgrade the electricity. You can\nrepair the roofs. And actually the code is a lot more lax\nthan the Uniform Building Code. The --\nQUESTION: What -- what is this code? Is it a\ngenerally applicable code about things like electric\nwiring and -- and sound roofs, or --\nMR. BRAUCHLI:\nAffairs usually uses the General Services Administration\nand the Uniform Building Code or the Uniform Code of\nBuilding Conservation. That's what the National Park\nService --\nQUESTION: But is that what you --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is that what you're referring to --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Right.\nQUESTION: -- when you say, the code?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Right. And their assessment, the\nBIA's assessment, in 1998 came out within a few hundred\nthousand dollars of our assessment of the -- of the cost\nto make the repairs which they had deferred maintenance\nbasically for 40 years in some buildings.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brauchli --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I'm -- I'm confused about -- about\nthese buildings that -- that have basketball-sized holes\nin the roof. The Government is still using these\nbuildings?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: No, they have not. Because of\nthe deferred maintenance, those buildings are boarded up.\nQUESTION: Well, then they're not using them\nanymore. So I mean, you can't argue --\nMR. BRAUCHLI:\nQUESTION: -- that they have -- if they're not\nusing them, you can't say that they're in control of them,\nand that their being in control requires them to make the\nrepairs. I mean, it --\nMR. BRAUCHLI: No.\nQUESTION: Under -- under the -- under the\nstatute, they're not required to use the buildings. They\nmay use the buildings. If they're no longer using them,\nand they have basketball hole -- size -- -sized holes in\nthe roof, it seems to me you have to come up with some\ntheory other than the Government's continuing control\nwhich imposes upon the Government the obligation to repair\nthe buildings.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Let me clarify something.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: The -- the buildings -- when the\nneed expires, their right to be there expires. I'm\ntalking about the -- the boys' dorm now. That's the\nbasketball-sized holes in the roofs.\nWe made a demand. The tribe made a demand for\nthe return of 15 buildings. They said, you no longer need\nthem. Give those buildings back to us. Your -- your\nright to be there has expired, but you give us the money\nfor the -- to repair those because they're not\ninhabitable. They used to be.\na lot of money. We have photographs from 1960. We know\nthey were in very good shape in 1960.\nQUESTION: And what did the Government say? You\ncan't have the buildings, or you can't have the money?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: They said -- oh, they -- they\nwant to give us the buildings.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: They said, you can't have the\nmoney.\nQUESTION: Well, that's exactly right, it seems\nto me, if the only theory on which they're obliged to\nrepair them is that they're in control of them. They're\nsaying, you know, we're not using them anymore. We don't\nwant to repair them. If you want them, they're yours and\nyou can repair them.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: They don't own them, and under\nMitchell II, this Court said that when the United States\nis in control of a -- of a resource of a tribe, a -- a\nfiduciary relationship is established in respect to that\nresource.\nQUESTION: No, but isn't your argument that\nthey -- I -- I'm not saying whether you win or lose on it,\nbut isn't your argument that they are obliged to give us\nthe money to repair them because the deterioration took\nplace when they were in control?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes.\nQUESTION: Isn't that your point?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: That is my point which I did not\napparently express very well, but that is the point\nthat --\nQUESTION: You mean they -- they were still\nusing those buildings when the -- when the basketball-\nsized holes in the roofs appeared?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: They were using the buildings as\nthe progressive -- it's not a Big Bang Theory about a\nbuilding falling down.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRAUCHLI: It's -- it's a progressive\ndeterioration of the buildings. And then when they felt\nthat -- they just started to board them up, and -- and we\nsaid, okay, we'll take -- they said -- well, actually,\nthey wrote a letter, said they're yours. And we said,\nwhat do you mean they're -- they're ours? With an\n$8 million repair bill and you had total control, and you\nfeel you have the right to destroy property that you don't\nown?\nAnd this deprives Congress of the benefit that\nCongress intended. So here's the executive branch saying,\nwe don't care what Congress gave you. We'll make sure you\ndon't get anything except a -- a pile of rubble. And\nsomeone has got to pay for that, and the tribe should not\npay for that. And that's the point of the damage claim.\nWe went to the Secretary and they said -- after\na year of wasting my time at the solicitor's office, they\nsaid -- finally, the Special Assistant to the Secretary\nsaid, you're going to have to sue us because we're not\ngoing to give you the money, and we feel we have the right\nto destroy this property. And that's -- whether it's\ndemolition by neglect or, as the Department of Justice\nsaid in the circuit court below, since you don't have\ntitle to this property, contrary to the plain text of the\nact, we have the right to dynamite it.\nAnd somehow it's been held in some kind of\npurgatory state where what Congress intended to give to\nthe tribe wasn't really intended to give to the tribe.\nIt's a -- it's a plaything for the BIA to play with and\ndestroy.\nAnd that's not the fiduciary relationship that\nthis Court has been noted for in -- in respect to a one-\non-one relationship. In Nevada versus United States, we\nsaid, when it's one on one, a fiduciary relationship and\nthere's a fiduciary obligation incumbent upon the United\nStates when it deals with Indian people.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brauchli --\nQUESTION: What about --\nQUESTION: -- can I ask this factual question?\nI should know, but I really don't. How long ago did the\nGovernment's active use of the buildings cease?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: It is different depending on the\nbuilding, and that's why we say we have to go\nbuilding-by-building. And they have raised the statute of\nlimitations. They said, your claim is premature, in -- in\nthe trial court. Then, in the circuit court they said,\nit's -- no. They said it's -- you're too late. You\ndidn't -- the statute of limitations will bar your claim.\nSo that's still lingering out there.\nThen, in the -- then in the circuit court of\nappeals they said, it's not in trust, and therefore we can\ndynamite it.\nThen, in their briefs here they say, we control\neverything and your claim is premature.\nSo they have shifting defenses.\nDifferent buildings, because they didn't\nmaintain them, they started sloughing off one-by-one\nbecause they --\nQUESTION: Do you have a theory on when their\nactive use of the buildings ceased?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: It's -- it goes -- it really does\nhave to go by building-by-building because I would say\nthat --\nQUESTION: Give me any building. Was it\n10 years ago? Five years ago?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: -- in the last 5, 6. The last 6\nyears have been progressive, where they started boarding\nthem up and just stopped --\nQUESTION: And your theory is that the -- the\nwaste occurred before or after they ceased using some --\nor some of each?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: It's -- it's some of each. It's\na deteriorating use. We don't ask them to restore\npre-1960 condition. We're saying take the 1960 condition,\nand the waste you committed from 1960 when it's under your\ncontrol. We don't want them to -- they don't have to\nrestore it back to its -- as they say -- Old West shape.\nWe're just asking it -- for the condition that when we got\nit from Congress, Congress said, here's the gift. Here is\nthe Fort Apache, but we're going to give the Secretary\njust a limited use, and when that need expires, then the\nSecretary has no right because but for that act, the\nSecretary can't even set foot on that property. It's\ntrespass.\nQUESTION: Well, is it -- let -- may I also get\nclear on something that I -- I thought I was clear on but\nI'm not. Is it your theory that they are responsible for\nthe waste or damage or deterioration that took place up to\nthe point at which they ceased actively to use it, or up\nto the point at which they relinquished control over it to\nyou? Because I take it those -- for some buildings --\nwill be different -- different dates.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes. There's -- they maintain\nthat they relinquished some buildings and therefore it's\nbarred by the statute of limitations.\nQUESTION: No. But what is your theory? Is it\nthat their responsibility is measured by the date at which\nthey ceased to use, or the date at which they relinquished\ncontrol to you?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: It was the date when they\nrelinquished control and we accepted it because we refused\nto accept them without the money to repair them.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: And they're --\nQUESTION: So you're saying during part of the\nperiod in which the -- the property was just boarded up,\ntheir responsibility was still in effect.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Yes, because they still kept them\non their facility inventory maintenance list, but they\ndidn't get -- they get the maintenance money and they use\nit for other things other than the --\nQUESTION: Suppose in -- suppose in 1960 the\nGovernment said, here are the buildings. We don't want\nthem. And you said, well, you know, it's -- it's going to\ncost us a lot of money to keep up these buildings. You're\ngoing to have to pay for that. We can't do that. Could\nthe Government then say, well, we have a stand-off, we'll\ndestroy them?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Are you talking about after\nMarch 18th, or before --\nQUESTION: This is after the 1960 act was\nenacted and they had become the trustee.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: If they never physically occupied\nthose buildings or they stopped using them, it's not their\nliability. If they walked away from the property in -- on\nMarch 18th, 1960, they said, Hey, Congress just gave this\nto you. We've been using them but we're going to walk\naway today. No responsibility. None. Because when they\nwere the owner, they can do whatever they want. When the\ntribe becomes the owner and they -- they take control of\nthe trust corpus, then there's an obligation, the most\nfundamental, rudimentary, crude fiduciary duty as to --\nQUESTION: Can -- can the Government terminate\nthis trust anytime it wants?\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Pardon?\nQUESTION: Can the Government terminate this\ntrust anytime it wants by executive order?\nMR. BRAUCHLI:\nexecutive branch does not have the power to terminate this\nreservation. Only Congress can.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's what I thought. The\ntrust remains in effect at all times.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: But it's -- it'd be only a bare\ntrust, Your -- Your Honor, because if -- once they -- once\nthey relinquish the control and the need is not there,\ntheir liability ends. You know, we have taken over the\ncook's cabin. We've taken over four buildings. Their\nliability is going to end there because we took them over.\nWe had to use some self-help.\nQUESTION: What -- what of the Government's\nargument that this was really an illusory trust? That is,\nthe statute, the 1960 statute, gave the Government the\nright to use this for -- for school and administrative\npurposes as long as they wanted to. So at -- looking at\nit from 1960, that could be forever. They might have\nwanted to use it as a school forever, and then the tribe\nwould have nothing.\nMR. BRAUCHLI: Well, the -- to answer that\nquestion, Your Honor, the measure of damages always could\nbe measured against a reasonable trustee. If they kept\nusing for 100 years, then of course, there's going to be\nnormal -- you know, even normal wear and tear, but there's\nstill -- that's something for the trial court to sort out\nas to the measure of damages. I mean, what is\nreasonable -- what is reasonable to repair, what is\nreasonable not to under the circumstances. That's --\nthat's a question for the trier of fact as to the measure\nof damages.\nBut, you know, the reality of the situation is\nthat the need has expired except for about 10 buildings.\nIn this -- I mentioned the Bostwick case because\nin the Bostwick case, the United States had open, free\nuse -- unrestricted use of a private home, and they --\nthey committed waste. And there was -- and this Court --\nCourt -- they were sued. The United States was sued and\nthe Court said that there's an implied covenant against\nwaste even those the lease is silent as to that duty. And\nI think the analogy is here in the trust situation.\nWhen -- when -- it doesn't matter if the statute doesn't\nsay you have to repair buildings when you're using them.\nIt would be unnatural for a statute to say so.\nThat's all I have, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Brauchli.\nMr. Garre, you have 1 minute left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it\nplease the Court:\nThe Government is not using the property, and is\nnot required to use the property for the benefit of the\ntribe as the court of appeals acknowledged at page 14a of\nthe appendix to the petition. It's using the property for\nits own Government purposes, and in that respect, this\ncase is completely unlike Mitchell II, where the statutes\nand regulations specifically required the Government to\nmanage the property as an economic resource for the\nIndians.\nThere are no trust assets to pay for any\nhistoric restoration efforts because Congress directed\nthat the property would be used for Government purposes,\nnot for any -- any kind of economic purposes that would\ngenerate assets. Congress has a separate regime for\nhistoric preservation. It grants millions of dollars each\nyear for historic preservation projects, and as\nMr. Brauchli alluded, Congress has granted funds for\nhistoric reservation at Fort Apache. The tribe has\nengaged in its own historic preservation efforts there\nwith millions of dollars of private, State, and Federal\nfunding, and the Department of the Interior has put\nmillions of dollars of its own maintenance and repair\nefforts into the fort.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS:\n(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
