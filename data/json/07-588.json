        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first today in Case 07-588, Entergy Corporation\nv. Riverkeeper Incorporated, and the consolidated cases.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL\nPROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL.,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor more than 30 years, EPA has construed\nthe Clean Water Act to permit it to consider the\nrelationship between costs and benefits in setting\nlimits on water intake. The court of appeals'\nunprecedented limitation of that discretion is wrong as\na matter of basic Chevron interpretive principles for at\nleast three reasons.\nFirst, the controlling statutory standard,\nwhich looks to the best technology available for\nminimizing adverse environmental impacts, is ambiguous\nand does not preclude EPA's interpretation, especially\nin light of the statute's other \"best technology\"\nprovisions, two of which expressly require consideration\nof the relationship between costs and benefits.\nSecond, there is no indication that Congress\ndetermined for itself that the benefits of stricter\nregulations would in fact outweigh their costs.\nInstead, from the context -- I'm sorry, for -- I'm\nsorry. There is no indication in either the context or\nthe history of the statute that Congress determined for\nitself that the benefits of stricter regulations would\nin fact justify their costs. Instead the indication is\nthat Congress left that to the agency.\nCongress took a very careful look at the\nseparate issue of the discharge of pollutants and\nlegislated numerous very specific provisions concerning\nthe discharge of pollutants. But when it came to water\nintake, the Congress gave scant attention to that at all\nand included only this one very general provision in the\nact on that subject.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, in the\nother provision it specifically required consideration\nof costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this\nprovision.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. In our view, that\nstrongly supports our view that, first, Congress\nunderstood that consideration of cost and benefits was\nnot incompatible with the application of a best\ntechnology standard. Otherwise it would not have\nrequired that consideration as part of the best quality\nstandard, which seems to show at a minimum that a best\ntechnology standard does not unambiguously foreclose\nconsideration of the relationship between costs and\nbenefits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to follow up\non that, because your statement about compatibility\nraises what for me is a fundamental difficulty in\nunderstanding this case. And I think my difficulty goes\nboth to Chevron step one and step two. And that is\nthis: I think we all start from the premise that,\nwhatever else subsection (d) had in mind, it was\nimposing some kind of a technology-driven standard\ncriterion. It's there in the words.\nThe difficulty that I have is if you are\ngoing to apply on at least a site-specific basis a cost\nbenefit analysis, I'm not sure how it would work. In\nother words, it seems to me that when you're talking\nabout the possible harm from pulling in a few fish or a\nfew plankton or a few baby clam larvae and so on, as\nagainst the cost conceivably of millions of dollars for\nextending intake pipes or putting technical expensive\nfiltering mechanisms, you are dealing with such\nincommensurables that I don't know how on a site-\nspecific basis you would sensibly apply a cost-benefit\nanalysis. Are a thousand plankton worth a million\ndollars? I don't know.\nAnd my difficulty then is, I don't know how\nit would work. And because I don't know how it would\nwork, it seems to me that if you are going to apply a\ncost-benefit analysis, the odds are what you are going\nto do is basically eliminate the whole technology-driven\npoint of the statute. So that's my difficulty. Can you\nhelp me out on that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Two points on that. The\nfirst is that this is how it's always been done. I\nmean, since 1977 at least, first permitting decisions\nhave always been done on a facility by facility, case by\ncase basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do we know so far as intake\npipes are concerned? I mean, maybe I'm being foolish in\nthinking it's a little easy to make sense of it when\nwe're talking about toxic discharges, but leaving that\naside, do we know that, with respect to these kind of\nintake technology decisions, that the cost-benefit\nanalysis has been in any way sensible? In other words,\nmaybe what Congress had in mind was this just doesn't\nwork doing it on a site-specific cost-benefit analysis\nand that's why we're going to pass subsection (b) in the\nfirst place. So you say, well, we've had experience\nwith cost-benefit analysis. What's the experience?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Sure. I guess now I have\nthree points.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: The first is that -- the\nfirst is that the history here is, that I was referring\nto, is with respect to cooling water intake structures,\nwhere for more than 30 years cooling water intake\nstructures have been determined on a case by case basis,\nwhere EPA determined as early as 1977 and ever since\nthat it would be unreasonable to impose -- to require\nthe use of technology whose costs were wholly\ndisproportionate to its benefits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And have these been\napplications of something more than the outside\nstandard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in\na case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or\noutrageously disproportionate there wouldn't be -- that\nthere would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff?\nThese have been more subtle decisions than that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And I mean, just the\nphrasing of the standard, whether costs are wholly\ndisproportionate to benefits, itself indicates that\nthere is a comparison here. We cite in our brief one\nparticular -- in our reply brief, one specific example\nwhere benefits were clearly not de minimus.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Second Circuit\nrecognized that latter kind of taking account of costs\ndisproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and\nthey also recognized a cost comparison. If you have a\ncheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that\nand you don't have to use the one that will capture the\nextra fish. So everybody agrees that there is some\nconsideration of cost. The question is how much, and\nthe concern is, as Justice Souter says, that you are\ncomparing things that aren't comparable.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, first off -- I'm sorry.\nI guess one basic point is just that -- first off,\nexcuse me, in terms of the court of appeals' recognition\nthat costs and benefits could be compared in extreme\ncircumstances, that just deprives it of the logic of its\nposition, because when we talk about the extent or\ndegree or manner to which a permissible consideration\ncan be considered that's a classic manner for the\nagency's gap-filling discretion, not something for the\ncourt of appeals or Respondents to get discretion on.\nAnd, second, in terms of the concern that\nthe cost-benefit analysis can be difficult because we're\ncomparing benefits that are not easily monetized to\neconomic costs, that is just systematically the case\nwith all cost-benefit analyses, even ones which people\ndo in ordinary life. When I decide whether to buy a TV\nfor this amount or a more expensive TV for a different\namount, I don't know exactly how in my head I quantify\nthat, but I do. And with respect to cost-benefit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it easier to quantity\nthat than the value of a plankton?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Not -- well -- but with cost-\nbenefit analyses, again, this is routinely done by\nagencies. The statisticians and the economists --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is -- let me -- I will\ngrant you that agencies purport to do this kind of\nthing. But my question and I think Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion is, does it make any sense in these\ncircumstances to think that you really can do a cost-\nbenefit analysis? And if the answer is no, we have been\npurporting to do it but it really doesn't make a lot of\nsense, then it either means that there is just going to\nbe an irrational process going on, or it means that the\ntechnology-driven standard basically is going to be read\nright out of the statute, because you are always going\nto find some disproportion which is going to limit your\nuse of technology.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think the most irrational\nthing would be to just throw up one's hands and say that\nwe are going to impose standards whether or not they do\nharm more harm than good, whether or not they make any\nsense. And -- and here the agency very carefully\nconsidered the relative costs and the relative benefits\nand also did so in a way that puts its thumb on the side\nof the environmental side of the scales.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to get back\nto your television hypothetical, if you told somebody\nthat you were going to buy the best TV available nobody\nwould think you meant that you were going to buy a very\ncheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits,\nthat was the best one. They would think you are going\nto get the fanciest TV you could.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, these words have\ndifferent meanings in different contexts, which just\nunderscores their ambiguity. But taking the phrase here\nas a whole, if I said I was going to acquire the best\ntechnology available for winterizing my lawnmower so\nthat it would work again in the spring, the best\ntechnology available for winterizing a $400 lawnmower\nwould not be $500 fluid, because when one's talking\nabout protecting something it's intuitive to think about\nthe value of what's being protected.\nAnd again, Congress by expressly requiring\ncost-benefit analysis for some of the pollution\ndischarge limits was expressly contemplating exactly\nwhat seems to concern you, Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it make any\ndifference --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- that costs would be traded\nagainst benefits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have the two labels:\nThe BP, \"best practical,\" and then \"best available.\"\nAnd isn't it so that the best available technology,\nthinking of the Clean Air Act, what they call \"BAT,\" is\nconsidered the most technology-forcing standard and then\nthere are lesser standards? But you seem to think that\nthese can be --\nMR. JOSEFFER: All of these words can have\ndifferent meanings. I think of the four best technology\nprovisions that are expressly cross-referenced in this\nprovision, the one that's most informative here is the\nbest conventional pollutant control technology, because\nCongress expressly required cost-benefit consideration\nin determining the best conventional pollutant control\ntechnology and \"best\" is the only word in that phrase\nthat is amenable to a cost-benefit reading.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think maybe what\nJustice Ginsburg was beginning to get at is my question\nhere. I assume that BTA is the most rigorous of the\nstandards set forth in the statute. You can argue with\nthat assumption, but grant me the assumption for the\nmoment. If BTA is more rigorous than the other\nstandards, what is it in the regulations that reflects\nthe agency's concurrence with that? What is there in\nthe agency regulations that indicates that there is a\nmore rigorous examination under BTA than the other\nstandards?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, to be clear, the agency\ndoes not think and therefore did not in its regulation\npresume that the best technology available for\nminimizing adverse environmental impact was more strict\nthan the other standards. Just two commonsense points\non that. The pollutant discharge standards, which are\nthe other ones, establish their goal to be the\nelimination of discharges, whereas here this provision\nsays that its goal is to minimize. So on its face this\nis a more measured standard than the others.\nAnd, second, as a practical matter, there is\nno reason Congress would want greater protection for\nfish through intake structures than for people through\nthe discharge of pollutants. I mean especially --\nCongress enacted all of these provisions in 1972, and it\nprovided at that time that in determining pollution\ndischarge, even including toxic pollution discharge, EPA\nwas required to consider the relationship between cost\nand benefits up until 1989.\nAnd it makes no sense to think that Congress\nwould have wanted stricter standards for fish here than\nfor people under the toxic discharge provisions. And on\nits face --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you disagreeing with\nthe premise of Justice Kennedy's question?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Our argument is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think --\nJR. JOSEFFER: -- this provision here for\nwater intact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Congress intended a\ntougher standard?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Pardon?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You do not think Congress\nintended a tougher standard; is that true?\nMR. JOSEFFER: We think Congress did not\nintend this to be a tougher standard than the ones for\ndischarge of pollutants --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why didn't it use BPT or\n-- or one -- one of the other standards?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, because these are all\ndifferent standards. One thing that -- two thing are\nfor certain. One is that this standard is different\nthan all of the others --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If they are different,\nthen one is either less rigorous or more rigorous.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. But there is no\nreason to presume this one is more rigorous, especially\nconsidering -- first -- I mean, the words here -- it\nuses important words here it did not use elsewhere.\nHere we have \"best technology available\" --\n\"best technology available for minimizing adverse\nenvironmental impact.\" And, first, \"best,\" as some of\nthe examples earlier demonstrated, is not necessarily\nthe way that most singlemindedly pursues a goal at all\ncosts and without regard to all of the consequences,\nwhich is why -- for example, if you were talking about\nthe best way to get home, it would not necessarily be\nthe most direct route if that required payment of a\ntoll.\nSimilarly, \"minimize\" is also an -- and,\nagain, Congress used \"best\" to mean that in \"best\nconventional pollutant control technology,\" because that\nis the only word there that is amenable to our reading.\nAnd, second, \"minimize\" is also an important\nword, because \"minimize\" has two perfectly common and\nordinary meanings. One is to reduce to the greatest\nextended possible. The other in ordinary usage is to\nreduce to some lesser, reasonable level.\nSo if I said, for example, that I was trying\nto minimize the risk of being hit by a car today, I\npresumably would not mean that I was staying inside at\nhome all the time. Instead, it would mean that,\nconsistent with other needs, including economic ones,\nlike the need to travel to work, I was being prudent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if it \"available to\nreduce\"? \"For minimizing\" is no stronger than if it had\nsaid \"available\" -- if it meant what you suggest, why\ndidn't it read \"available to reduce\"?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, elsewhere in the Clean\n-- in the Clean Water Act, Congress clearly did use\n\"minimize\" to mean a reduction. If Congress called for\na, quote, \"drastic minimization of paperwork,\" Section\n33 U.S. Code 1251(f), then a \"drastic minimization\" has\nto mean a drastic reduction, which is a perfectly\nordinary meaning of the word.\n\"Available\" is also relevant because,\nJustice Ginsburg, as you mentioned earlier --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Reduce\" in any event is --\nis not -- is not the same as what you are arguing. You\nare arguing reduce to the maximum extent reasonably\npossible. The word \"reduce\" alone doesn't convey that.\nThe word \"reduce\" would just mean, you know, if you --\nif you knock it down any amount, you have reduced it.\nBut you are saying \"minimize\" requires more\nthan that. It means reducing it to the maximum extent\nreasonably possible. Isn't that what you are saying?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. We -- we construe -- I\nthink the other side might take that view of -- of\n\"minimize.\" Our view is that \"minimize\" means you have\nto reduce --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just to reduce.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- a reasonable -- refers to\na reasonable reduction. And so some minimal reduction\nin this context would probably not be reasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that to\nbe your position. You -- you don't think that\n\"minimize\" even means that you reduce it to the maximum\nextent reasonably possible?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, I guess it depends --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think any reduction\nconstitutes minimizing?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, because it does have to\nbe a reasonable reduction, which would not be -- in this\ncontext would not be a trivial one. Reasonableness --\nwe may -- we may agree, depending on what one means by\n\"reasonable.\" \"Reasonableness\" tends to connote a\nconsideration of -- of all relevant factors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: And so when we're talking\nabout a reasonable reduction, we are going to talk about\na reduction that is reasonable in light of, among other\nthings, the relationship between costs and benefits. So\nwe may agree if that's what we both mean by\n\"reasonableness.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me say it again and you\ntell me whether you agree. I had thought that what you\nmeant the meaning of \"minimize\" was is that you reduce\nthe -- the harm to the maximum extent reasonably\npossible, not merely that you reduce it to some extent.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think that's right with --\nwith \"reasonably\" entailing a consideration of -- of the\nrelationship between costs and benefits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, \"reasonable\"\nincludes everything.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes.\nIf -- I could reserve the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start with just setting the\nstage here. For almost 30 years now, the Executive\nBranch has had an executive order through all\nadministrations that requires a cost-benefit analysis to\nbe done whenever regulations are adopted. And that's\nbecause the Executive Branch considers that to be just\nan essential component of reasoned decisionmaking.\nSo this Court should not be quick to\nconclude that Congress intended to deprive the agency of\nthe tools that it needs to come up with reasoned answers\nto these vexing problems in the absence -- -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this is\na Chevron case?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it is a Chevron case,\nYour Honor. And we think -- certainly think it could be\nresolved under step one, meaning the following: Can you\nread the statute reasonably to say that Congress\nunambiguously foreclosed cost-benefit analysis under\n316(b)? I think the answer to that is no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the -- one\nquestion I have on this is if I look at the two\nstandards -- and the first one is \"best practical\" -- it\ntalks about cost-benefit. It says you shall consider\nthe total cost of application of technology in relation\nto the effluent-reduction benefits.\nThen you look at \"best available,\" and\nthey've changed the phrase. It doesn't get rid of cost,\nbut it simply says you shall take into account the cost\nof achieving such effluent reduction.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, but that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they both use the word\n\"cost.\"\nMS. MAHONEY: They do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you look at what\nSenator Muskie said at the time.\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what Senator Muskie\nsaid at that time is the object here is when we move to\nbetter -- to better technology, we -- you know, when you\nget past the practical and you get into the other, it\nsays -- stop considering costs? Not quite. He says:\n\"While costs should be a factor in the administrator's\njudgment.\" So he is not against using costs. He says\nthat you have to do it under a reasonableness standard\nwhere you are taking into account all the goals and so\nforth.\nNow, that's ambiguous. But, as I read it,\nit says: Of course you can't avoid taking into account\ncosts, but don't do it too much.\nAnd, therefore, you would say: Don't apply\none of these big formal things when you reach your final\ngoal. There are other ways of getting there. Of\ncourse, see that it isn't absurd. And for 30 years the\nagency has had a way. It has talked about \"grossly\ndisproportionate.\"\nNow, that's the whole background to the\nquestion. My question is, of course: Why not let\nsleeping dogs lie? Let the agency take it into account\nthe way it's done it to prevent absurd results, but not\ntry to do it so that it's so refined you can't even take\naccount of what a fish is worth unless they happen to be\none of the 1.2 percent that goes to market.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, we are not\narguing that you have to do monetized cost-benefit\nanalysis, nor did the agency say that it was basing its\nrule on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine. Then what are\nyou arguing? Are you arguing that you should take costs\ninto account? Because I don't think -- or I don't think\nyou should reach much disagreement on that point, that\nsometimes you take them into account the way that\nSenator Muskie suggested.\nMS. MAHONEY: But, Your Honor, the -- the\nSecond Circuit held, and Respondents argue, that the\nbenefits have to be essentially the same before you can\nlook at the cost of the technology.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well now, what they are\ngoing to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and\nI would be very interested in hearing it.\nMS. MAHONEY: But that is what they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then you would be\nsatisfied with the following ruling: The Second Circuit\nwent too far in saying that you can never take costs\ninto account.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can\nsometimes take account of them, and the standard that we\nthink is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one\nthey have used for 30 years. Is it grossly\ndisproportionate? Are you -- is it feasible? Is it\npractical? Are you using costs along with other things?\nHow do you feel about some slightly vague thing like\nthat?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, something like that, as\nlong as it is clear that costs can be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are happy with that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, as long as costs can be\ncompared to benefits, and the Second Circuit said they\ncould not be; that the benefits have to be essentially\nthe same. That's what \"cost-effectiveness analysis\"\nmeans. Of course the statute doesn't say \"cost\neffectiveness.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's simply\nsaying the Second Circuit was wrong, the use of the word\n\"cost\" is meaningless without some idea --\nMS. MAHONEY: Of comparison.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of what the costs are\nrelevant to, but a -- but a vague, grossly\ndisproportionate test is okay with you?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it or not?\nMS. MAHONEY: A -- a vague, grossly\ndisproportionate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The one they used for 30\nyears at EPA, is that all right or not all right?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think the point\nis: Yes, if for 30 years they have not been mandating\nclosed-cycle cooling under that standing -- standard, so\nfrom the industry's perspective, that probably is an\nacceptable standard.\nBut the real point here is that when we\nstart talking about to what degree can you compare the\ncosts, is it significantly greater than, is it wholly\ndisproportionate, that's exactly where Chevron comes in.\nIf everyone concludes that you can compare costs to\nbenefits, then certainly the agency should have some\nflexibility.\nWith respect to the question of whether it\nshould be the same standard as the -- what I think\nyou're referring to as the B-A-T standard, which governs\ndischarges of even toxic pollutants, I think the answer\nto that is that not necessarily by any means, because\nthe acronyms are similar but the text isn't. That\nstandard actually talks about the goal of eliminating\ndischarges. Congress did not say eliminate all\nimpingement and entrainment to the country. They could\nhave, they didn't.\nThey said minimize adverse environmental\nimpact, which is necessarily a broad delegation of\ndiscretion to the agency. In addition, that standard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, I -- before\nyou go any further. I am not clear. I -- I did not\nunderstand that for 30 years the only test has been a\ngrossly disproportionate test. You seem to accept that\nas true.\nMS. MAHONEY: Wholly disproportionate, Your\nHonor, has been the test. That's what has been used.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wholly disproportionate?\nMS. MAHONEY: Wholly disproportionate, not\ngrossly disproportionate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're -- you're happy\nwith that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, the point is that I -- I\nthink what I am happy with is saying that the agency\nshould have discretion to formulate what test it's going\nto use. But under the wholly disproportionate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. You think they can\nuse a wholly disproportionate?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you'd be happy if they\ncontinued to do that, but you wouldn't be particularly\nhappy if we prescribed that as the only available test?\nIs that the --\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I just think that it's\nhard to get that out of the language. When -- when it\ndoesn't come straight out of the language \"wholly\ndisproportionate,\" then you ought to leave it to the\nagency. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the -- could the\nagency mandate a closed-cycle system, recirculating\nsystem --\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, they haven't.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for a whole plant?\nCould they -- under your view, could the agency, given\nits Chevron latitude, mandate closed circulation?\nMS. MAHONEY: Under a wholly\ndisproportionate standard, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just under the statute.\nMS. MAHONEY: Under the statute, I doubt it.\nIt would probably be arbitrary and capricious. But --\nand -- and let me explain why.\nThe statute talks about minimizing adverse\nenvironmental impact, and it's important to understand\nwhat the EPA did here. At page 169a of the appendix,\nthey say: \"We are using impingement and entrainment as\na quick and convenient metric.\" In other words, we are\ngoing to make you reduce impingement and entrainment to\nthe -- to a very large extent, get it down, you know,\nclose to zero if we can, whatever. But that's not\nbecause it is itself adverse environmental impact. They\nsay they didn't define it at 287a.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it seems to\nme -- of course, there are limits on what the agency can\ndo, but if it couldn't mandate the closed circulation\nsystem -- I think I've got the term right -- if it could\nnot do that, then this is not -- you're backing away\nfrom Chevron.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, here's -- here's how we\nwould say it, Your Honor. There may be some locations\nwhere that -- where it would not be wholly\ndisproportionate. If -- if for some reason you couldn't\ndesign an alternative system that would protect, for\ninstance, a balanced population of fish in that water\nbody, then it might be that -- that -- that\nclosed-cycled cooling would be required.\nBut on a national basis, at 355a the agency\nsaid that they understood that reducing impingement and\nentrainment at the ranges they were talking about would\nnot be justified in many locations across the country.\nAnd that's because power plants may be impinging numbers\nof fish that aren't actually harming that water body.\nFish have the potential to procreate in very substantial\nnumbers. Some fish spawn 500,000 eggs in a year. And,\nso, if the -- and throughout the act, even under 316a,\nfor instance, Congress has said that, even with respect\nto thermal discharges, you can get variances if you can\nshow that you are not harming a balanced population of\nfish in the water body.\nSo given that, given the variances\nthroughout the act and even these kinds of limits on the\ndischarge standards, which are designed to protect human\nhealth, why would you read the mandate for the maximum\ntechnology on intake structures which has nothing to do\nwith human health, nothing. It is just to protect fish\nin the water body.\nSo, it doesn't make sense that in a single\nsentence added in conference in a voluminous act about\ndischarges of pollutants, that Congress would mandate\nthe maximum technology for --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't they use\nthe word \"cost\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: Because, Your Honor, I\ndon't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, your -- your\nargument is they used cost here, they used cost there,\nthey didn't use cost here but they must have meant cost.\nMS. MAHONEY: Here's why, Your Honor:\nBecause the most significant comparison between this\nstatutory section and the others is they didn't list any\nof the factors. All of the other sections have -- have\na detailed list of considerations that the agency must\ntake into account. This one says nothing. This is not\nan example of where --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And maybe the inference to\nbe drawn is the agency is not supposed to be taking any\nof these considerations into account.\nMS. MAHONEY: I -- I don't think that's the\nmost reasonable inference because it would lead to very\nirrational results, 200-foot cooling towers in -- in --\nin town -- in historic old towns --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You've got the -- I mean\neverybody agrees that there is kind of an ultimate\nirrationality standard here. So that's -- that's not --\nthat -- that kind of a horrible is not really the point.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI don't know where in the language you can get allowance\nto take into account things like energy impacts. Why?\nIf Congress gave a complete and full standard, why can\nwe take into account aesthetic harm, navigational harm,\nenergy impact? It doesn't allow for that, and I think\nit doesn't allow for that because Congress intended the\nagency to define the terms in a reasonable way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. MAHONEY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Lazarus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LAZARUS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn section 316(b), Congress did not\nauthorize EPA to decide that the benefits of minimizing\nadverse environmental impact did not justify the cost of\navailable technology.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except -- except, you say,\nwhen it's grossly disproportionate?\nMR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where -- where do\nyou find that? Or the Second Circuit said, anyway.\nMR. LAZARUS: Let me explain our position,\nYour Honor. EPA has no authority in any circumstance to\ndecide that fish aren't worth a certain amount of cost.\nSo EPA never has the authority, in any context, to weigh\ncosts against benefits. The reason why we think that\nwould not lead to the kind of absurd circumstances\nthey're suggesting is not because Congress has that --\nsorry -- EPA has that authority. It's because we don't\nthink that those kinds of absurd circumstances result\nfrom the cost-benefit balance mandated by Congress.\nLet me explain why, because there are three\nsafeguards in the statutory language, its plain meaning,\nwhich would guard against any possibility that a\nregulated facility would have to spend millions or\nhundreds of millions or billions of dollars to protect\njust a few fish.\nThey would -- that would never happen. I\nmean, it would never happen, but not because EPA can\ndecide it's not worth it. This is why it would never\nhappen. Three reasons, and these are contributing\nreasons.\nThe first reason is if you actually had some\nexorbitant huge increase in costs, if that would happen,\nmost of those cases would be triggered by the\navailability requirement. And that is, that EPA could\ndeem that cost not be reasonably borne by the industry.\nThat's the ground they --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't want to interrupt\nyou in your enumeration of three reasons, but I just\ndon't see how you get cost into the concept of\navailability. It doesn't fit in there any better than\nit does under \"best.\"\nMR. LAZARUS: No, I think it -- I think it\nfits quite well in the word \"available.\" And EPA has\nsaid that since 1976. It was not disputed by anyone\nthat available --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not the plain meaning\nof the word. If I look in the real estate page of\nthe -- of the \"Washington Post\" on Sunday and I look for\nthe best house that is available, the best house that is\navailable might cost $50 million. Now, that would be\navailable to me. I couldn't afford it, but it would be\navailable.\nI don't see how cost can be fit into that\nconcept of availability.\nMR. LAZARUS: I think because it's clear\nthat in the context of the Clean Water Act what Congress\nmeant in available -- and this is throughout the\nstatute -- all the technology-based performance\nstandards, the availability was both technologically\navailable and economically available. And that is not\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are using the word in a\nstrange -- economically available? Economically\nfeasible maybe. But you wouldn't say economically\navailable. You wouldn't say I can't buy the house\nbecause for me it's not economically available. I might\nsay it's not economically feasible, it's not\neconomically possible, but it's not economically\navailable? That's weird.\nMR. LAZARUS: It may -- it may be weird,\nYour Honor, but it is not anything that has ever been\ndisputed in the interpretation of the Water Act. It's\nhow EPA has interpreted it for 30 years, and no court,\nno one, has ever disputed the fact that availability\nincludes economic availability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I disagree with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Availability -- if\navailability includes economic availability, why doesn't\n\"best\" include economically best?\nMR. LAZARUS: Because what the statute says\nis not that EPA should -- should promulgate the best\ntechnology. It says the best technology available for\nminimizing.\nAnd what -- what Congress did was told EPA\nwhat the technology must be best for. And that is not\nreducing it to the amount that EPA believes is sensible.\nIt means minimizing it, which means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- but that -- but\nthat doesn't answer, it seems to me, the question. Yes,\nthe best available for that purpose, but what is best\nfor that purpose could include other factors such as how\nexpensive is it and -- and how much it harms the\nindustry and all sorts of things.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, it certainly -- it\ncertainly includes costs. It certainly includes sort of\nwhether it can be reasonably borne by the industry.\nThere's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why does it? I don't\nknow how you draw the lines you are drawing. You say\nyes, \"best\" includes whether it would bankrupt the\nindustry. Well, if it includes whether it would\nbankrupt the industry, why shouldn't it include whether\nit would bankrupt the individual power company?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, there is no -- there is\nno question, Your Honor, that the word \"available,\" and\nperhaps the word \"best\" -- we think the word \"available\"\nincludes an inquiry into whether or not it could be\nborne by the industry. We also wouldn't doubt, Your\nHonor -- we wouldn't doubt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I agree with you on\nthat, whether it's borne by the industry. But you draw\nthe line there.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, that's not what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it where that\nline is drawn up to the agency?\nMR. LAZARUS: We're not, Your Honor -- let\nme explain because I think we are confusing different\ninquiries here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. LAZARUS: We also would agree that EPA\ncan take into account site-specific factors in deciding\nwhether technology is available. Some technology is\navailable for some facilities given their location, but\nnot available for other facilities given their location;\nbut when -- where EPA decides, right, where EPA decides\nwhether technology is available or not, we don't doubt\nthey have authority to do that and some discretion to\ndecide when technology is no longer available because of\nthe cost. But where they don't have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't\nthat exactly what they did here in listing what they\ncall a suite of technologies or approaches that is\navailable? I thought that was exactly what they did.\nThey said for different locations, different\ntechnologies may be the best available.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right. And that is perfectly\nappropriate. But here's what they did which is not\npermitted. They could decide based on site-specific\nfactors whether technology is available. What they\ncan't do is, once they decide a technology is available,\nthey can't then say: But we don't think it's worth\nminimizing adverse environmental impact with that\ntechnology, because we don't think those benefits are\nworth that cost. That comparison inquiry they can't\nmake.\nSo if I can do my safeguards: The first one\nis we think availability and cost would eliminate a lot\nof those problems. But let's assume -- let's just\nassume that technology is much more expensive, way more\nexpensive, but it's still available in our view. It\nstill can be borne by the industry even on a\nsite-specific basis, which we don't disagree that could\nbe done.\nThen let's say that the national -- EPA says\nwell, but that will only save -- you know, your cheaper\ntechnology will only save a million fish. We actually\nthink you have to save a million and one fish.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how you can do\nthat. I just don't see it. It's -- I mean, suppose\nthat the cost of this machine is $100,000. Now, if you\nsay I'm talking about using that machine for an entire\nindustry, you would say, my God, that is certainly\navailable. But here I have just one part of the\nindustry here; I have a little plant; and you know, to\nhook that machine up is only going to save one\nparamecium. Neither of us wants that.\nAnd so the logical thing to say is to say\nwell, it isn't available for that. And I would be with\nyou there.\nMR. LAZARUS: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But to be honest about it,\nI would have to say the reason it isn't available is\nquite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the\nharm -- that particular adverse impact which is killing\na -- a water animal. The reason it isn't is because it\ndoesn't kill any water animals. Well, let me be honest;\nit kills one, or it kills two --\nMR. LAZARUS: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or it kills three, and\ndon't tell me de minimis, because as soon as you say de\nminimis, I'm going to add one, okay?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what I'm trying to show\nhere is that -- that there -- it isn't meaningful to\ntalk about cost being available for an end, without some\n-- about something not being available for an end in\nlight of its costs, unless you take into account what\nthat end is. I mean, we'd spend trillions to make\nAmerica secure so not 50 thousand people die, but we\nwon't spend trillions for a road accident. And -- and\nof course you take those things into account.\nSo that's -- that's exactly the point I\nwonder about. Are you really saying pay no attention or\nare you saying, which I could understand better, but you\nhave to say what you want, I mean, that what we mean is,\nyes, they can take costs into account. That's what they\ndo under the comparable standard, best available\ntechnology, but just use your head, don't do it too\nmuch, don't use it -- like take other things into\naccount, too, don't do a formal cost-benefit analysis;\ndon't try to evaluate the paramecium. Do the difference\nbetween the -- you know, the two standards: Best\npractical, best available. Do \"grossly\" or \"wholly\" or\nsomething.\nMR. LAZARUS: But for best available there\nis no cost-benefit analysis. It's only for best\npractical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, but best\navailable says take costs into account.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, there is a way of\ndoing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that\nthey have some discretion over, that doesn't involve\nsome enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am\nsearching for. I don't -- I am not sitting here with an\nanswer. I'm trying to find a way of making sense of\nthis.\nMR. LAZARUS: But -- well, let me try to\ngive you an answer. They can consider costs only in a\ncost feasibility perspective. They cannot compare costs\nto benefits. Congress made --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those two things seem\ncontrary to me. I don't see how you could -- do you see\nwhy?\nMR. LAZARUS: No, I don't, because it is two\nfundamentally different policy decisions. What Congress\ndecided in 1972 was that EPA should be allowed to\nconsider costs in determining whether technology was\navailable, but not -- and they did this for a reason,\nYour Honor -- but not to weigh those costs against those\nbenefits in deciding whether or not those costs were\nworth it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But how is it -- how is it\nfeasible if it has no benefits at all?\nMR. LAZARUS: It -- it -- it's still\nfeasible for, in terms of the industry, whether they can\nafford it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then we are going to reach\nour insane results.\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes -- you are never going to\n-- you are never going reach the insane result. It's\nnever going to happen, Your Honor. It's never going to\nhappen. Put aside the availability limitation, which\nwill cut off like it did dry cooling. EPA rejected it\nsaying it was too expensive. Not because of the\ncost-benefit: it's too expensive. If you have some --\nsomething where it will only just be saving a few fish\n-- what you have to remember is that 316(b) doesn't\nimpose technology design reform. What it imposes is\nthat technology-based performance standards. And if EPA\nwere to say, you have to save just a few more fish, if\nthey really want to promulgate a standard on that kind\nof increment, the regulated facility would always be\nable to save just a small increment, without adopting\nsome expensive technology, because of the way cooling\nwater intake structures work.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your\nargument is focused on proving that your interpretation\nwon't lead to insane results, as you put it. But you\nhave to do a lot more than that. I mean, you have to\nestablish that this is not ambiguous language.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, I think it's not\nambiguous language because you look at the statutory\nlanguage, it says -- right? That's in section 316(b) --\nEPA is required -- right? Instructed, required, that\nlocation, design, construction, capacity of cooling\nwater intake structures reflect the best technology\navailable for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\nAnd what we argue, and I think this is quite compelling,\nYour Honor, is that with that language Congress itself\nstruck the cost-benefit analysis. Congress said for\ncosts, EPA has to ensure the technology is available.\nEither on industry wide, and could take site into\naccount site-specific factors. For benefits, Congress\nsaid EPA has to ensure that the environmental benefits\n-- the adverse environmental impact -- be minimized to\nthe extent it can be done with available technology.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have a good -- you have\na good argument based on the language of the statute, I\nthink, that that costs cannot be taken into account at\nall.\nMR. LAZARUS: But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: At all. But once you\nconcede that it can be taken into account at all, then I\ndon't see why you were not in Chevron step 2.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, this is a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Once the foot is in the door\nI don't see how you can --\nMR. LAZARUS: It's a complete line. Whether\nthe word \"available\" can extend to cost feasibility\nanalysis is one question. Whether the word \"available\"\ncan be -- allow EPA to compare costs and benefits, to\nweigh one against the other, that's a completely\ndifferent question. So the fact that we say the first\nhalf, it doesn't mean the second. Congress really had a\n-- what they were doing in 1972, was Congress --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But our problem is that\nwe -- you've got a clear distinction in mind, and I -- I\ndon't think we are getting the distinction. Is the\ndistinction in crude terms this: they can consider\ncosts in the sense that on an industry-wide basis they\ncan ask, is there money in the bank or will there be\nmoney in the bank to pay for this? They don't ask\ncost-benefit in the sense of asking: is the money in\nthe bank worth what they are going to get for it?\nSo is -- is the line you are drawing a money\nin the bank line? Is that the point you are making?\nMR. LAZARUS: No. It's -- it's they can't\nmake a judgment that it's not worth it. It's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right. But --\nMR. LAZARUS: And for reasons that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the only question,\nwhen you say they can consider costs, are you saying\nthey are simply asking whether it is economically\npossible for the industry to afford this, regardless of\nwhether it's any good or not?\nMR. LAZARUS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that what --\nMR. LAZARUS: Absolutely. What -- 1972, if\nthis is what Congress is faced with.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you say whether the\nindustry can afford it, does it take into account at all\nthe effect on the that price consumers have to pay? If\nthe effect of achieving a small gain in protecting -- uh\n-- fish is to increase electricity costs ten times, is\nthat something that cannot be taken into account?\nMR. LAZARUS: If it can be reasonably borne\nby the industry or some site-specific, they can't make\nany other judgment. And if I can, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can't make any other\njudgment. So imagine the consequence of that\nenvironmentally. They can't make any other judgment.\nSuppose the EPA is right: it's going to add 20 electric\nplants, huge plants, purely to save the fish; and the\nresult is the cost of electricity goes up, and the\nresult is there are no electric cars, because people\nmake the comparison with oil, and now they have to have\npetrol. I mean, it's very hard for me to believe that\nSenator Muskie would have written a statute that would\nhave foreseen such an effect.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right. I think because such\nan effect wouldn't happen. What Senator Muskie and\nCongress was worried about in 1972, Your Honor, was they\nwere worried about the possible underregulation. They\nworried about overregulation. And their concern was, if\nyou gave EPA the authority to weigh costs against\nbenefits, you would have systemic underregulation and\nthe regulatory process bogged down by --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly where I\nagree with you. So I go back to page 170 of the\nlegislative history, which I have read now six times,\nand I agree with you that it is not totally clear.\nMaybe you think it is. But it seems to me what he is\nsaying there is just what you've said: Don't go into\nthis with some elaborate thing, but remember costs are\nstill relevant. And what I've been searching for\nthroughout is a set of words that would help me\ntranslate that thought into a legal reality.\nMR. LAZARUS: And going back to Justice\nSouter's statement a moment ago, which I agree with,\nwhat Senator Muskie's distinction he wanted to draw was\nto allow EPA to engage in cost analysis as to\nfeasibility, money in the bank, but not to make that\nvalue judgment of what's worth what. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you get to\nthat money in the bank, does this mean that best\ntechnology available changes over time? I mean, maybe\nthe industry could have borne these costs two years ago,\nbut they probably can't today. Nobody has money in the\nbank today.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAZARUS: It certainly does depend, and\nthis is how EPA does it, not just in this area but\nthroughout all the technology-based performance\nstandards, looking at availability. EPA looks at\nindustry revenues, barriers to entry, and decides\nwhether or not this technology is available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think they\ncould have said, two years ago, this is what you have to\ndo, but today they would say you don't have to do that\nanymore --\nMR. LAZARUS: It's quite possible --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even though the\ntechnology is still available.\nMR. LAZARUS: Notice -- notice -- not\neconomically. Notice in this case, what the Second\nCircuit said in remanding was EPA may be able to justify\nthe same decision on availability basis, but they didn't\nmake that determination here. What has happened for the\npast 30 years, which is how I -- counsel over here\nposited the case -- what has happened over the last 30\nyears is the EPA has ignored the statutory language and\nit engaged in this wholly disproportionate analysis as a\nresult, which has led to the very kind of\nunderregulation that Senator Muskie was worried about,\nand that is that they had never looked to see whether\nclosed-cycle cooling is in fact available, economically\navailable. Instead, they tried to compare these things.\nThey've just kept from going Phase I through cycle\ncooling. They've never given a serious look at\nclosed-cycle cooling. And the kind of increment we're\ntalking about, if they actually looked at closed-cycle\ncooling, if they'd make available information, we are\nnot talking about increments; it's a 98 percent\nreduction in the water flow that happens. If you go\nfrom one --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lazarus, can I ask you\n--\nMR. LAZARUS: -- phase to closed cycle.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion? It's not economically available if it would\nbankrupt the whole industry?\nMR. LAZARUS: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What about if it bankrupts\nthree firms?\nMR. LAZARUS: If it bankrupts three firms --\nif one looks how EPA has interpreted that historically,\nYour Honor, throughout all the pollution control\nstatutes, the Air Act, the Water Act, Resource\nConservation Act, EPA has said that itself is not enough\nto say it's available for the industry, but it is\npossible -- we don't doubt this -- it is possible --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's not economically\navailable to those three firms.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, but here's what happens:\nWhat the EPA said -- and you can see this in this\nCourt's decision in the Crushed Stone case, where the\nCourt drew this distinction. A particular facility can\nseek a variance based on cost impact to them, if they\ncan show that the cost to them is much greater because\nof some particular circumstances to them than it is for\nthe industry as a whole. And this Court said they could\ndo that. EPA has long said it. We don't question it,\nthat they can do a cost-benefit --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but this -- they just\nhave -- they are just not quite as strong a company.\nMR. LAZARUS: No. And that's the very\ndistinction this Court drew in the Crushed Stone case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But is the variance a\nmatter of statutory right or -- or is it available under\na regulation?\nMR. LAZARUS: It's -- the way this Court\ninterpreted sort of the use of categorical standards in\nthe Dupont case, early on in the 1970s, the Court said\nin that case that EPA can promulgate these kind of\ntechnology-based performance standards on a categorical\nbasis --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. LAZARUS: -- but if they do so, they\nhave to take -- they have to give a variance possibility\nbecause if a particular --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why isn't that\nsimply another name for cost-benefit analysis?\nMR. LAZARUS: Because you can't do it on a\ncost-benefit -- it's not a cost-benefit variance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you are doing it on\ncost-benefit. You are saying --\nMR. LAZARUS: No --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we require this and\nthe company goes bankrupt, the value of demanding it is\nnot satisfied by the result.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, that's not the\njustification for the cost variance. The justification\nfor cost variance is not because of a sort of benefits\nbeing lost. It's because if you can show -- if the only\nbasis you can get a cost variance -- and this is an\nimportant distinction but not an easy one -- the only\nway you can get a variance is if you can show the\nassumptions EPA made about how much this would cost\ndon't apply to you because there is something different\nabout your facility, so it actually costs you much more.\nYou can get a variance for that. You can't get a\nvariance if you say, \"We are a weak company and our\nrevenues aren't strong.\" You can't get a variance for\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you can't get a\nvariance and you also would say the EPA cannot take it\ninto account if this particular plant -- although the\ncompany as a whole is quite prosperous, this is a small\nplant, and it's not generating that much electricity.\nIt's really just not worth it to put in this big tower.\nWe are going to close down.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would not be something\nthat EPA could take into account.\nMR. LAZARUS: The EPA can take into account,\nas they do for all technology-based performance\nstandards, they can take into account the size of the\nfacility to the extent it bears on the availability\nquestion. They can't do it because they think it's not\nworth it in terms of the benefits over here. They can\n-- they can take into account on availability, but not\nover here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the\nparticular case? What they said here is that, if you\nrequire the closed circuit for everybody, we are going\nto have to build, we are going to have to pay an energy\npenalty of 2.4 to 5.3 percent. You will have to build\n20 additional 400-megawatt plants, which is huge, many,\nmany, many billions of dollars, and the -- just to\nreplace the capacity you have lost. And the result,\nwhich seems quite logical, would be to increase by a\nlot, not just a little, the consumption of fossil fuel.\nWell, now how are they not -- you seem to\nbe arguing that they can't take that into account,\nwhich, for an environmental agency, I would have\nthought, \"But they must take it into account.\"\nMR. LAZARUS: We are not saying they can't\ntake that into account. EPA has said they can. The\nSecond Circuit said they could, and we agree. But\nhere's how they could take it into account. They can\ntake it into account in deciding what will be necessary\nto reduce environmental impact. So they can take into\naccount those things that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if they did exactly the\nsame thing they've done, which I've just read you, and\nthey put a label on it, instead of saying \"thinking of\nbenefits,\" we were calling it now \"taking into account\nenvironmental impacts,\" then they could do it?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well -- but they -- here's\nwhat they could do, Your Honor, and I don't think there\nis anything anomalous about this: The EPA can say,\n\"Here are the factors we're going to take into account\nin deciding whether or not we are minimizing adverse\nenvironmental impact, and we have some authority to\ndecide what is and is not a relevant environmental\nimpact. We -- here the industry can take into account\nin deciding whether or not this technology, this cost,\nmakes it available or not.\" They have authority here,\nbut once they decide whether technology is available,\nonce they decide what \"environmental impact\" means and\nwhat it means to minimize, once they decided that, they\ncan't then say, \"Well, we don't think these impacts are\nworth those costs.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see that thought, and\nthis is what's concerning me, but there may be a very\ngood answer. A lot remains to be done with EPA. They\nhave an enormous job to do. And I wouldn't want to get\nthem tied up in unnecessary red tape, where everybody is\nsuddenly taking them to court on rather technical\nthings. So if this \"grossly\" or \"wholly,\" or whatever\nyou call it, read out of the Muskie page 170 -- read it\nout of the \"available technology\" definition, you can\ntake costs into account; just don't do it in this other\nway. I can see how they could work with that.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm worried about what\nyou are saying that may make it so difficult for them\nthat they won't be able to do the job.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, we are doing the exact\nopposite now, Your Honor. What we are trying to do is\nsay that the information that EPA has to focus on, the\nway Congress constrained them, is limited and it doesn't\nallow them to weigh one against the other.\nWhat happens if -- and this is why Congress\ndidn't want to give EPA cost-benefit analysis authority\nhere or almost anywhere in the statute. Congress was\nconcerned that it would bog down the regulatory process,\nand that is that if you actually had EPA -- had to come\nup to this weighing of one to the other and try to weigh\nthese imponderables, you would be subject to such\nextraordinary attack -- it happened in this case with\nthis rulemaking -- it would slow down the decisionmaking\nprocess. It wouldn't speed it up. Congress understood\nthat information is not costless. And sometimes one can\nachieve a better cost-benefit balance by having\nregulation be based on less information rather than more\ninformation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree.\nMR. LAZARUS: And that's why they said, \"We\nwant to take out this particular\" -- remember, before\n1972, there was cost-benefit analysis based upon\nassessment of water quality impacts. And Congress saw\nwhat happened with that. It completely paralyzed the\nregulatory decisionmaking process. They ended up with\nvery little regulation. So they said: All right, we're\nnot -- we think EPA can do cost-feasibility analysis\nwell. We don't think they do cost-benefit analysis\nwell. We think that kind of information is several\norders of magnitude greater and more imponderable, and\nit's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is the reason they\ndon't do cost-benefit analysis well because they are\nforced to do it in a political atmosphere in which it is\ndifficult to make rational decisions? Is that basically\nthe reason Congress would have come to that conclusion?\nMR. LAZARUS: I think that may be part, but\nI don't think that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that --\nMR. LAZARUS: -- the real reason in 1972. I\nthink that does happen. I think the real reason, 1972,\nwas that Congress saw what happened before, and they\nsaid, it turns out to be really hard in the water\nquality context to measure and value environmental\nimpact. It's so hard that we think that EPA can get a\nbetter, more rational result if we instead say, here's\nwhat you focus on, technology available, minimizing, and\ndon't try to compare.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I think -- I see your\npoint, but I think if I accept your point, all I am\ndoing is saying, they may in a kind of smoke and mirrors\nway take cost-benefit analysis into consideration sub\nrosa, when they decide what availability is going to\nmean; and they make take it into consideration when they\ndecide what a -- a -- an undesirable environmental\nimpact is; and that sort of gets the -- the weighing\nprocess out of the public focus.\nAnd if they do it that way, they -- they can\nbring in just the considerations that Justice Breyer is\ntalking about, but they don't do it in an obvious way.\nAnd I think that's what your argument boils down to.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, I think argument boils\ndown to that they can focus on environmental impact,\ndecide what is and isn't environmental impact, they can\nfocus on availability, decides what costs are relevant\nto that, and when is the technology available --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What costs are relevant to\nthat?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, the relevant --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When they made that\ndecision, are they not in effect anticipating the kind\nof decision they would make on a more specific basis in\na more highly charged political atmosphere, if they\nengaged in the cost-benefit analysis that you say they\ncan't do?\nMR. LAZARUS: It may well be one reason why\nCongress didn't want to compare one to the other, about\nthat charged atmosphere. But what -- they can't do it.\nI don't think they are doing it sub rosa. Our point is,\nYour Honor, is they do it according to Congress's\ninstruction, you won't have these kinds of absurd\nresults.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the page -- the page of\nthe legislative history or the page of the text of the\nstatute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it\nwith your son. It costs $100.\nMR. LAZARUS: I think that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your son says, \"It costs\n$100.\" You say, \"That's too expensive.\" He says, \"But\nI didn't tell you what it was for.\" What? I mean --\nyou see?\nNow you tell me the page, and I have read a\nlot of it; tell me the page of the legislative history\nor the phrase of the statute where it says what you just\nsaid -- that you cannot take into account what you were\nbuying for that $100.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What page? I will read it\nagain.\nMR. LAZARUS: I'm -- I'm not going to give\nyou a specific page. I'm going to give you the\nstatutory language in section 316(b).\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know 316(b).\nMR. LAZARUS: What Congress is doing\nsystemically in 316(b) and throughout the Clean Water\nAct is that Congress is saying we want to give EPA the\nauthority for cost feasibility; we don't believe in this\n-- that it works with cost-benefit analysis because of\nthe weighing against one against the other.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it has -- it has\nrequired, not just permitted but required cost-benefit\nanalysis in other areas. What --\nMR. LAZARUS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is your\nresponse to the fact that it -- it seems ridiculous to\nallow it, and indeed require it in effluent situations\nwhere human health is at stake, and yet to forbid it in\nthis intake situation when you were just talking about\nthe snail darter. What -- what's your response to that?\nMR. LAZARUS: Two responses, Your Honor.\nThe first is that in 1972, which is when 316(b) was\nenacted, Congress did not allow cost-benefit analysis\nfor toxic pollutants. Toxic pollutants were not\nregulated under section 301 and 304 of the statute.\nThey were not subject to best practicable technology;\nthey were not subject to best available technologies.\nThey were subject to a separate provision, and that this\nsection 307 at that time. That's a subsequent amendment\nto the law. Where Congress originally --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And did that section 307\nnot allow cost-benefit?\nMR. LAZARUS: It did not allow cost-benefit.\nThe way Congress originally approached hazardous water\npollutants and toxic air pollutants, the Clean Water Act\nis the same. They said EPA, this is so harmful that we\nactually want you to do an assessment to figure out at\nwhat level will it no longer be harmful to humans? And\nwhat they found out when they tried that, is they found\nout, boy, that information is unbelievably hard to come\nup with. And so, they had -- the regulation depended on\nthis incredible information, and the result was that EPA\ndid nothing. They did the nothing for water toxics,\nthey did nothing for air toxics. So in 1977, when they\nlearned how more information could lead to less\nregulation, they said all right: we've got to change\nthat. That doesn't work, so we are going to move to a\ntechnology-based performance approach in the first\ninstance, and then couple it with -- still keeping the\nhealth-based as a backup, to be able to go past that.\nSo they put the technology-based as the\nfirst step and they kept the 307, but in 1972, Your\nHonor, there was only one provision of the Clean Water\nAct in which Congress delegated any authority to EPA to\ncompare costs and benefits; and that was under 301(b)(2)\nand 304(b)(2). And in that provision they said until\n1977 only, EPA for best practical control technology,\nyou can and you must do cost-benefit analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. LAZARUS: That's the only provision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have to\nagree, wouldn't you, that the panel's decision in this\ncase overruled the prior panel's decision in judge\nKatzman's decision in Riverkeeper 1?\nMR. LAZARUS: No, they certainly didn't\noverrule it for two different reasons. If you look at\nthe Riverkeeper 2 opinion, I think it's on 25a, note 11,\nthey explain that in Riverkeeper 1, dry cooling was\nrejected because it was too expensive. That's an\navailability consideration, not a cost-benefit\nconsideration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in Riverkeeper\n1 what Judge Katzman said is that we think EPA was\npermitted to consider costs and energy efficiency in\ndetermining the best technology available. He was\ndeciding it on the basis of availability, too.\nMR. LAZARUS: He gave -- he gave several\nreasons, Your Honor. Also included was the fact that it\nwas too expensive. Which is why the Riverkeeper 2 court\ncharacterized that as dictum. In all events, with all\ndue respect to my former colleagues on the Georgetown\nfaculty, Judge Katzman was wrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Joseffer, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL\nPROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JOSEFFER: Thank you. If I could start\nwhere I left off, the fact that Riverkeeper 1 in their\nview is wrong, I think does confirm what anyone would\nconclude after reading the two opinions, which is that\nthey are not consistent. At a minimum that helps to\ndemonstrate ambiguity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's an ambiguity the\ngovernment said it could live with. Now the government\nadvised this Court not to grant cert in this case, isn't\nthat so?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Our -- our -- what we said\nwas we thought the court of appeals was dead wrong, that\nit was a very important issue, but in the interlocutory\nposture of this case, which was a remand, we did not\nthink that it was -- was so important as to warrant your\ncert standards. Frankly, we were delighted to find out\nwe were wrong about that.\nThe other point I need to make is that this\ncase is, after all, about the one sentence in the Act\nthat deals with water intake, not about all the other\ndetailed provisions about the discharge of pollutants,\nwhich is important because about half of the last\nargument dealt with the discharge of pollutants.\nThe fact that there is no list of factors\nhere, and instead just one general sentence, just\nunderscores that on this issue, Congress was delegating\nespecially broad authority to the agency to address a\nproblem that at the time was relatively novel, and that\nlegislative record confirms Congress itself did not give\nany real weight to. If we want to look at floor\nstatements, thought I would not look to the floor\nstatement of Congressman Muskey concerning a different\nstandard, which was the BAT standard, but instead the\nonly floor statement that addresses this standard, and\nit says that economic practicability is the test, and\neveryone agrees that practicably considers costs and\nbenefits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that was the House\nside, which the House side was against that. And the --\nthe question I have from your point of view is the --\nthe obverse question: if you look at this particular\ncost-benefit analysis, I mean, it goes through all these\nthings which, they don't know what the numbers are,\nnobody knows what the values of the fishes are, which\n98% are never even eaten, they are fast swimmers or\nwhatever.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the -- you see\nthe point here. That all of his fears, your -- your\nopponent, brother here, seem to be manifest in this kind\nof a document which, if you do read Senator Muskey,\nseems to be the very things he was against.\nSo -- so what is -- I am still left with\nyour suggestion of what to do, other than just, \"well,\nit's all fine.\"\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, look -- first off.\nWhat EPA did here was not among the most robust forms of\ncost-benefit analysis. In other words we don't think\nthe Court necessarily needs to expand -- to opine on the\nouter limit here. EPA did two things. First, as you\nmentioned, it first created national performance\nstandards; second it did a variance when an facility's\ncosts are significantly greater than the benefits.\nSo first in determining -- so -- well, the\nsecond of those is easiest, because there is an obvious\nthumb on the environmental side of the scales there.\nCosts have been to be significantly greater than\nbenefits, which is not all that aggressive.\nHere, with respect to the nationwide\nperformance standards, EPA again did not just try to do\na strict -- costs are, you know, one penny greater than\nbenefits. Instead it weighed up a number of\nconsiderations. It looked to the incremental benefits\nof closed cycle cooling versus the technology it chose.\nAnd then it -- it determined that those incremental\nbenefits were outweighed by a variety of other things,\nincluding -- one was the extremely high costs of\nclosed-cycle cooling, three and a half billion; second,\nthe cost-benefit ratio, which was extremely\ndisproportionate; third, the energy impacts which you\nmentioned are really quite significant.\nWe are talking about 40% of the Nation's\npower supply. If we are going to reduce that by 4\npercent and require 20 new plants to be built and\nrequire each of those plants to be taken offline for 10\nmonths while it's retrofitted, that's really a very\nsignificant concern of EPA's. And then the fourth is\nair pollution.\nAnd so when EPA is weighing benefits against\nall the other thing and is not purporting to assign\nartificial monetary values to everything, I argue that\nthis just underscores that we are well within the\nagency's discretion here.\nIf I could also turn then to just the main\npoint. One of the main points here is that I really\ndon't think Respondents have any logic to their\nposition, because when we are talking about the text\nthey say costs have to be considered against\naffordability and not against benefits. But when we are\ntalking about absurd results, they say, oh sure, you can\nconsider costs against benefits, when it would otherwise\nbe absurd. But under Chevron it's the agency's\ngap-filling discretion to decide when where to draw that\nline, and nothing draw a de minimis line in the statute\nany more than the line EPA has drawn.\nCHIEF
