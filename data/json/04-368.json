MAHONEY, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioner 50\nP R O C E E D I In G S\n[10:07 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Arthur Andersen v. United States.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Government concedes that the destruction of\ndocuments in anticipation of a proceeding was not a crime\nin the fall of 2001 based upon a statutory rule that\nCongress had preserved for over a century. The central\nquestion in this case is whether Congress, nevertheless,\nintended to make a polite request to engage in that lawful\nconduct, a form of witness tampering punishable by ten\nyears in prison. We ask this Court to reject that\ninterpretation of the statute and to hold that Arthur\nAndersen did not commit a crime.\nI'd like to turn first to the term \"corruptly\npersuade\" as it's used in Section 1512 and explain why\nArthur Andersen's interpretation represents not only a\nreasonable reading, but the best reading of the language\nin the statute.\nThe first thing that we see when we look at the\nstatutory context is that Congress did not prohibit -- did\nnot prohibit -- all persuasion to destroy documents for\nthe specific purpose of making them unavailable for use in\nan official proceeding. It did not, because it did not\nsimply say, \"Anyone who persuades a witness to do this has\nviolated the statute.\" It added a very important\nlimitation, and that is the word \"corruptly\" -- \"corruptly\npersuades.\"\nSo what kinds of requests are excluded from the\ndefinition? When is it that it's okay to persuade someone\nto destroy a document for use in an official proceeding?\nAnd the answer, we think, based on the traditional meaning\nof the term \"corruptly,\" is that \"corruptly\" means that\nyou have persuaded someone in a fashion that uses improper\nmeans, such as bribery, or you've asked the witness to\nviolate duties imposed by other law, whether that's the\nduties imposed by contempt or the duties imposed by a\nwhole range of statutes that govern the obligations of\npeople in our society.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose you persuaded --\nand I know that is not this case -- suppose you persuaded\nthe person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a\nfraud. Would that be corrupt?\nMS. MAHONEY: If -- Your Honor, if it was a\ncrime, then, yes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in order to -- let's say\nit's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and\nyou persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to\nconceal the fraud.\nMS. MAHONEY: Okay, if this is in a -- in the\ncourse of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to\nbe a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by\nSection 1512. If it is in advance of a proceeding -- and\nlet's assume that you know that a proceeding --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- is likely, then the answer\ndepends on whether you know that you are concealing --\nthat you know a crime has been committed. And if you know\nthat a crime has bee committed, then you are violating a\nfederal statute, 18 U.S.C. --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My question is, Does that give\n-- would that give some content to the meaning of\n\"corruptly,\" in your view?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, in that case, if the witness\nknows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking\nthem to violate, they have a duty, under those\ncircumstances, not to assist you in concealing your\noffense. That's a duty that's imposed by criminal law.\nSo if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are\ncorrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would\nfall within the interpretation of the statute that Arthur\nAndersen is advancing here.\nAnd it fits, Your Honor, with what Congress\nreally did for a hundred years before 2002. What it did\nis, it said that -- under the Pettibone rule, that it is\nnot a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of\na proceeding. But if you know that -- if you know that a\ncrime has been -- a crime has been committed and you\ndestroy documents, that is a crime.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I --\nMS. MAHONEY: That's a crime --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- may I ask you about\nanother provision, Section 1515(c)? And that says, this\nchapter -- and it -- and it's referring back to Section\n1512 -- \"does not prohibit or punish the providing of\nlawful bona fide legal representation services in\nconnection with, or anticipation of, an official\nproceeding.\"\nNow, how -- did Ms. Temple invoke that provision\nin this case?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the -- that section\nwas not argued to the District Court, but it was invoked\nin the following way, in two ways. First of all, there\nwas evidence introduced in the case that she was providing\nlegal advice. And since it is not in affirmative defense,\nit really was the Government's burden at all times, at\nleast once there was evidence introduced that she was\nproviding legal advice, to get a finding from the jury\nthat she was not engaged in bona fide and lawful services,\nparticularly in this case, Your Honor, where the\nGovernment argued, told the jury, that Nancy Temple was\nthe, quote, \"central figure,\" end quote, in this -- in\nthis episode. And in addition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you know it's not an\naffirmative defense?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it doesn't read like an\naffirmative defense, Your Honor. It doesn't say\n\"affirmative defense.\" It simply -- and in -- when it was\nintroduced, it was listed in the legislation as a Rule of\nConstruction. And I think that's exactly how it reads.\nIt doesn't purport to put the burden of proof on Andersen,\nor on Nancy Temple.\nAnd, Your honor, I think, actually --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course, it has the\nword \"lawful,\" \"the providing of lawful bona fide legal\nrepresentation services.\" So, you know, it could be\nargued that if she violating the other provisions, she's\nstill in violation.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, under the\nGovernment's definition of \"corruptly,\" she couldn't have\nbeen providing lawful bona fide services.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's what I want to\nknow, is, in light of the Government's position and the\nway this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what\ndoes it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision? I'm\njust curious how it all plays out.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think it negates it\nin its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in\nthis case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding\nability of a possible future proceeding, even if the\nAndersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that\ntheir conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt. They\nwere instructed that they must find that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does that have the\neffect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your\nview?\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. But I think, Your\nHonor -- because I think it would be impossible to satisfy\nit under this instruction. In addition, I also think that\nthe -- that this provision really just demonstrates that\nthe Government's interpretation of \"corruptly\" is wrong,\nto begin with.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's the effect, in\n1512(b), of the word \"knowingly\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think, Your Honor, that\n\"knowingly\" means, in this context -- just as it means\n\"knowingly intimidate,\" \"knowingly threatened,\" \"knowingly\ncorruptly persuade\" -- that means that you have to know\nthat your persuasion is asking the witness to violate\ntheir duties, to violate the law. You have to know that\nit's corrupt.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that satisfied at least\nby the part of the definition that refers to \"subverting\nan official proceeding\"? I mean, that certainly carries,\nto me, the implication that you realize that you're doing\nsomething wrong. An official proceeding is, prima facie\nat least, lawful, and you are subverting it. Doesn't that\nsatisfy the \"knowingly\" requirement?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause the definition that was given to this jury was\n\"subvert, undermine, or impede,\" and not just the\nintegrity of the proceeding; but, rather, the fact-finding\nability of a future proceeding --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- including a governmental\ninquiry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I think I would go far in\nagreeing with you if the -- if the instruction had been\n\"merely to impede\" or \"merely to undermine.\" Now, I guess\nthat gets to a question I wanted somebody to answer, and\nyou can probably do it. Did the -- did the Court, in\ngiving the instructions, ever refer -- in defining the\nterm, ever refer to any of these three possibilities,\nseparately, or did it do it simply as \"subvert, undermine,\nor\" -- what was the third? -- impede\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: Impede. I believe -- I believe it\nwas done as a -- as a -- as a group.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It did --\nMS. MAHONEY: But it says \"or.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- one other question. In\nanticipation of that instruction -- I assume the counsel\nnew what was coming -- did the Government ever argue to\nthe jury that \"merely impeding,\" alone, or \"merely\nundermining,\" alone, would be sufficient, as distinct from\nsaying, \"If he subverts, undermines, and impedes\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I'm not certain of the\nanswer, except that I do know that the Government did\nargue that simply -- the mere idea that David Duncan\ntestified that, you know, he thought that the -- somebody\nat the SEC might want to look at this information someday\nwas sufficient to satisfy the instructions. And so, I\nthink it is a fair inference that the way that they argued\nthis case to the jury was that any intent to keep any kind\nof information away from the SEC was enough to satisfy the\ndefinition in this case. And, in fact, Your Honor, when\nthe instructions were being debated, the pattern\ninstruction for the Fifth Circuit for \"corruptly,\" under\n1503, actually is -- includes the words \"knowingly or\ndishonestly to subvert the integrity of the proceeding.\"\nThe Government insisted that the word \"dishonestly\" not be\nused, that the word \"impede\" be added, and they changed\n\"fact-finding\" a bit -- changed it from \"subverting the\nproceedings\" to \"the fact-finding ability.\" They did\neverything they could to strip this instruction of any\nmens rea, and then went beyond that and said, \"And in\naddition, even if the Andersen employees had a good-faith\nand sincere belief that their conduct did not violate the\nlaw, it's still a crime.\"\nSo, what we have here is an array of testimony\nfrom people who say, \"We honestly believed that this was\npermissible conduct,\" but the jury was told that they had\nto convict anyway if there was any possible partial\nmotivation to impede possible future fact-finding --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- of an inquiry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how does -- how does David\nDuncan's guilty plea -- he entered a plea of guilty to a\ncharge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to\nimpede the SEC investigation by shredding documents. So,\nwhat were the elements of that offense that are absent in\nthis one?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, he plead guilty to the\noffense, as described to him and agreed upon between him\nand his lawyer; in other -- and the Government -- which is\nbasically the instruction that was given in this case.\nWhen he testified in this proceeding, he repeatedly said,\ndespite his guilty plea, that he did not believe, at the\ntime, that he had done anything unlawful or improper. He\nsaid, \"I thought my conduct was perfectly appropriate. I\nplead guilty because I was persuaded that it didn't matter\nwhat I thought at the time.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What sentence did he get, by\nthe way?\nMS. MAHONEY: He's not been sentenced yet, Your\nHonor.\nAnd he was explicit throughout. He also said --\nhe never testified that he even thought that an SEC\nproceeding was probable at the time; he just thought it\nwas possible. Nor did he say that he ever consciously\ntried to hide the truth or hide the facts. What he did\nsay is that, \"Yes, part of what was on my mind at the time\nthat I asked for compliance with this policy was that the\nSEC and others might want to look at these files someday,\nand I'd better get them in compliance with our retention\npolicy, because I know that drafts and notes are the kinds\nof things that could be misused and misconstrued at some\npoint in the future.\" That was the basis of his guilty\nplea, that was the basis of his testimony in this case.\nAnd the Government's interpretation, the instructions that\nwere given to this jury, deprived the term \"corruptly\npersuade\" of any of its ordinary and traditional meaning.\nUnder the Government's view, for instance, of\n\"corruptly,\" bribery becomes irrelevant under this\nstatute. I mean, if you look at this statute, and you\nsay, \"What was Congress trying to prohibit here when it\nsays\" -- it's a got a list of wrongful means of\ninterfering with witnesses. It says \"intimidate\" and\n\"threaten\" and \"use of physical force,\" and it says\n\"corruptly persuades.\" The first thing that would come to\nyour mind is bribery. But bribery is irrelevant under the\nGovernment's interpretation, and let me explain why.\nBecause they say that, \"Well, yes, it's true, it says\n'corruptly persuade,' but all that means if you -- is if\nyou had any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a\nproceeding, then you're guilty, just for asking. It\ndoesn't matter whether you used any money -- monetary\ncompensation in order to extract this behavior; you're\nautomatically guilty. But if you use bribery --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume it also would make\n\"intimidate,\" and so forth, quite superfluous.\nMS. MAHONEY: It absolutely would, Your Honor,\nbecause it would basically cover any kind of request.\nBut, in addition, they say that under their\ndefinition what it really means is that if you did it for\nsome other motive, if you got them to destroy the document\nso that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding --\nand that was your intent, that it couldn't be used in an\nofficial proceeding -- and you bribed them to do it, but\nyour motive was to avoid embarrassment, it would not be a\ncrime. Under Andersen's interpretation, it would still be\na crime, because of course you have corruptly persuaded\nthem to destroy a document for use in an official\nproceeding, even if -- at the appropriate time, if there\nis a nexus -- because it doesn't matter whether you were\ntrying to avoid embarrassment; if you were bribing them to\nkeep it out of the -- of the proceeding, of course that\nwould be covered by the traditional definition of\n\"corruptly persuade.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you're anticipating a\nrevenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from\nthe SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not\nrequired to keep, but that would make the officials' task\neasier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of\ndays, instead of -- it's going to take him a week. Can\nyou make it harder for him?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, under Section 1519,\nnow, it may well be that that is criminal behavior,\nbecause it -- Congress has now, basically, required you to\npreserve documents. But, at the time, no, that would not\nhave been a crime. And if you could do it yourself, then\nasking your wife to throw them out instead can't be what\nCongress really had in mind under Section 1512. You know,\nhypothetical, the man could throw it out himself and not\ngo to jail, but if he asked his wife to do it, then he\ngoes to jail for ten years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There is, in the case, this\nlingering feeling that something's wrong out there. I\nknow that we don't -- we don't convict people on that\nbasis; we require something more specific.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, and I think that this\nstatute, reasonably read, Your Honor, tells you exactly\nwhat that specific thing is. If you intimidate them, if\nyou mislead them, if you use physical force, if you\ncorruptly persuade them. And that means either you've\nused unlawful means, like bribery, or you asked them to\nviolate their independent legal duties. And that\ndefinition, Your Honor, is quite consistent with the\ntraditional interpretation of the term \"corruptly,\" even\nin the obstruction statutes.\nAnd I'd like to just emphasize, for instance, in\na tampering case, a juror tampering case that preceded the\ncongressional adoption of the term \"corruptly persuades,\"\nthe Jackson case, the jury was specifically instructed\nthat \"corruptly\" means \"knowingly and willfully, with the\nspecific intent to influence a juror to violate his duties\nas a petit juror.\"\nSimilarly, in Aguilar, in the District Court, the\njury was instructed -- that was a tampering case -- quote,\n\"an act is done corruptly if it is done voluntarily and\nintentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or\na lawful result by some unlawful method,\" end quote.\nThis is exactly parallel to the interpretation that\nAndersen is asking this Court to adopt. And if that if\nthat interpretation is adopted, it makes sense of this\nstatute. If this statute isn't read in reference to the\nviolation of other legal duties, than it covers a whole\nrange of conduct that is unquestionably innocent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I just don't like the\nIRS, and I know they're coming. I have some very detailed\nsummaries which will give them the answer they need right\naway. I throw away those summaries and make them go back\nto the original records just to make it tough for them.\nCan I do that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Section 1519, I don't think you\ncan. Could you have done that in the -- in the fall of\n2001? Yes, Your Honor, you could. What that really\nreflects is the Pettibone rule. The Pettibone rule, for a\nhundred years, was that destruction and other kinds of\nacts of potential obstruction in advance of a proceeding\nwere not a crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, we -- you know, we\nall know that what are euphemistically termed \"record-\nretention programs\" are, in fact, record-destruction\nprograms, and that one of the purposes of the destruction\nis to eliminate from the files information that private\nindividuals can use for lawsuits and that Government\ninvestigators can use for investigations. And there has\nbeen nothing unlawful about having such a program, even if\none of your purposes is not to leave lying around in the\nfile stuff that can be used against you by either the\ngovernment or a private individual.\nSo, I would have thought that your argument was\nvery persuasive, except for the fact of 1519. I think\nthat 1519 gives me cause to believe that Congress could,\nindeed, say, \"You can't have record-retention programs.\"\nHow else do you interpret 1519?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, they certainly hadn't said\nit in the fall of 2001, Your Honor. And so, for that\nreason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but I -- well, yeah, but\n--\nMS. MAHONEY: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but your argument is, you\nknow, \"It's inconceivable that they would have meant\nthat.\" But, my -- they said it in 1519 --\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- -- in 2002.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- let me put it this way. If\nthey're gonna -- if they're going to say it, though, they\nhave to say it with very clear language, because,\notherwise, there would be no fair warning. You couldn't\nconclude from the language of the witness-tampering\nstatute, which is designed to protect witnesses, that\nCongress had made all record-retention programs unlawful.\nI also think, Your Honor, that when it comes\ntime to construe Section 1519, some kind of nexus will\nhave to be, you know, reasonably read in there, because,\notherwise, you are correct, all document retention\npolicies, or virtually all of them, are fatally doomed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And what is a\n\"document\"? I mean, in Justice Kennedy's example, is it\njust some handwritten notes? Do they become \"documents\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor. And, in\nthis case, the evidence was quite clear that, you know,\nAndersen retained its work papers, and the work papers\nwere extremely extensive, and they were required to fully\ndocument the audit. The only things that were thrown away\nwere notes and preliminary drafts, which had already been\nincorporated, in effect, into the final conclusions in the\nwork papers; and yet that was the whole theory of this\ncase, is that there were some documents that were\ndestroyed. They were precisely the kinds of documents\nthat document-retention policies are designed to\neliminate, in part -- for a variety of reasons, but, in\npart, because they are preliminary in character and they\ncan be misconstrued.\nFor instance, Your Honor, the FBI agents,\ngenerally speaking, have the practice of not keeping their\nnotes of interviews. They take those notes, they make a\nfile memorandum, they throw away the notes. Why do they\ndo that? Of course they know the defendant would love to\nhave those notes when it comes time for a trial. They do\nit because they feel that they have written it up in an\naccurate way, and enough's enough.\nThat's what we're talking about here, Your Honor.\nAnd there was nothing in the language of 1512 that would\nhave put Andersen on notice that its document-retention\npolicy was -- well, in fact, the Government doesn't say\nits document retention was a crime; it says it wasn't a\ncrime. Instead, the crime was when David Duncan asked his\nsecretary to throw away documents that he could have\nthrown away, lawfully, himself. This statute does not\ngive fair warning that that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was Section 1519 at issue?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. Section 1519 did\nnot get passed until the year 2002. It did not exist.\nInstead, the rule that was in force then was the Pettibone\nrule, the one that's reflected in the text of Section\n1505; and that is, \"the proceeding must be pending.\"\nThat's, no doubt, why the Government didn't charge\nAndersen with a crime under Section 1505. I mean, they\nmake it sound like the culpability here is the destruction\nof records. Well, if so, then you would think that they\nwould have charged Andersen with destroying documents --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute --\nMS. MAHONEY: -- but they didn't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- wasn't there another\nprovision in effect that said it doesn't matter whether\nthe -- whether the proceeding is pending? I forget which\none it is.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, that -- no, that's just 15-\n-- that's 1512, for witness tampering. But for the act of\ndestroying documents to interfere with a proceeding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. MAHONEY: -- that's Section 1505, and the\nproceeding must be pending. And that is -- that is still\nthe rule today, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- just to make it\nclear, I take it you would still have the same objection\nto the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a\nproceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, if a proceeding is -- yes,\nwe would, in this case. Yes, absolutely. But, you know,\nif a proceeding is pending, then it changed the -- changes\nthe way that you apply the definition of \"corruptly.\" But\nyou're certainly right that the definition is the same.\nThe question is, under the proper definition of\n\"corruptly,\" did you induce the witnesses to engage in\nthis activity through improper means, such as bribery, or\ndid you try to get them to violate their independent legal\nduties? For instance, if they had duties, under Section\n1519, not to destroy, then it makes perfect sense, because\nwhat you have done is, you have asked the witness to\nengage in conduct which violates the law, and that\ncorrupts them, it harms them, it fits with the purposes of\nthe statute, it fits with the structure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it was proper, then, for\nMichael Odom to tell the Andersen personnel when he's\nencouraging them to follow the policy -- he said, \"If it's\ndestroyed in the course of normal policy and litigation,\nand litigation is filed the next day, that's great. We\nfollowed our policy, and whatever there was that might\nhave been of interest to somebody, it's gone and\nirretrievable.\"\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's fine for him to make\nthat linkage between, \"Destroy it. Maybe there's going to\nbe litigation filed tomorrow.\" \"That's great. It will be\ngone\"?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, at the time that he\nmade that statement, what that statement actually reflects\nis the Pettibone rule. He was accurate in his -- in his\nstatement about what the law was governing document\ndestruction at the time. That's a good-faith reasonable\nbelief that was absolutely supported by the law.\nBut, more importantly, Your Honor, if we look at Mr.\nOdom's remarks, he wasn't working -- he wasn't -- this\nwasn't in connection with the Enron engagement; there were\nonly, I think, ten people, out of, like, 80, at that\ntraining seminar that had anything to do with Enron. He\nwas talking about the firm's document-retention policy.\nThe jury asked to see that videotape. They may have\nactually convicted Andersen based upon his remarks about\nthe document-retention policy. They, similarly, may have\nconvicted Andersen based upon Nancy Temple's memos that --\none of which was a reminder to the engagement team that\nthey were supposed to applying -- complying with the\ndocument-retention policy. That's legal services. This\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Odom wasn't saying this in\nthe abstract. There were other proceedings, weren't\nthere?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, it was just a\ntraining session that was just a -- a section of the\ntraining session. It has -- literally, I think there were\n89 attendees, only about ten of them --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At the time of that training,\nwere there not other proceedings involving Arthur\nAndersen?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. No, I don't\nbelieve so. That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There were, involving Enron, at\nthat point, isn't that correct? The -- Enron had gotten\nthe letter?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. That was on\nOctober the 10th. The letter did not come until October\nthe 17th. Andersen learned about it on October the 19th.\nI'd like to save the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal, please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Ms.\nMahoney.\nMr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nArthur Andersen's conduct in this case explains\nwhy Congress enacted a statute like Section 1512 that\nprotects against the anticipatory destruction of documents\nwhen a proceeding is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Section 1519, enacted\nsubsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than\n1512?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, Section 1519 was\nenacted after the events --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- in this case in order to plug\nthe loophole that Arthur Andersen has pointed out existed\nin Section 1512 at the time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you think it's superfluous.\n1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise in\nfutility, because the law already did what 1519 said.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. The law did not already do\nwhat 1519 says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wherein does it go further?\nMR. DREEBEN: It reaches single-actor\nobstructive conduct. What Ms. Mahoney has said --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about the\nPettibone interpretation that has been outstanding for a\nlong time?\nMR. DREEBEN: Pettibone applied, Justice\nO'Connor, to a specific statute, Section 1503, and it's\nsimilarly incorporated in 1505. Those statutes protected\nagainst obstruction of pending judicial, administrative,\nand congressional proceedings. The innovation in Section\n1512 was to reach beyond the existence of a pending\nproceeding and to ensure that basically the store doesn't\nget robbed before the proceeding starts.\nIf Arthur Andersen is correct, the anticipation of a\ngrand jury investigation that is thought to occur the next\nday, a corporation can send out a directive to its\nemployees and say, \"Shred all the smoking guns.\" It's the\ncorporate equivalent of seeing something that looks like a\ncrime scene and sending somebody in before the police can\nget the yellow tape up to wipe down the fingerprints.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When can they do it? When can\nthey do it? You didn't allege here that it was in\nanticipation of any particular proceeding. You say they\ncan't do it once they know that the investigation is on\nthe way. But your theory in this case is that they can't\ndo it, whether they know the investigation is on the way\nor not. They can't destroy any evidence that might be the\nsubject of an investigation.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, that's not our theory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is your theory?\nMR. DREEBEN: Our theory is that a person acts\ncorruptly when anticipating a reasonable possibility of an\ninvestigation into a specific matter, directs another\nperson to destroy documents that are potentially relevant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"A reasonable possibility of an\ninvestigation.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you want criminal liability\nto turn upon that.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether or not there is a\nreasonable possibility of an investigation. You want\nsomebody to go to jail on how a jury decides that\nquestion.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think there's anything\nunusual about the decision of that kind of question at\nall. It's a analogous, but different and quite\ndistinguishable nexus requirement from the kind of nexus\nrequirement that this Court interpreted Section 1503 to\nhave in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I have a company and I\nknow that the pattern is, I'm going to be audited every\nfive years by the IRS. And in year four, I -- one year --\none year before the investigation, I instruct my\nbookkeeping staff, \"Keep everything you need to document\nour expenses, but destroy everything that's remotely\nrelated to that, or indirectly related to that. Give them\njust a clean, simple file. Destroy anything that's -- all\nsupporting documentation. Give them what they need and\nwhat they're entitled to have, but nothing else. And\nstep up that policy, because they're going to be here next\nyear.\" Under your -- it seems to me that that violates\nyour rule.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, it turns on\nwhether the intent there is to subvert, undermine, or\nimpede the proceeding. And the answer is, if it is yes,\nthen it would be prohibited by this statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would be prohibited to\ntell somebody to do it.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you could do it. The doing\nof it is perfectly okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: That was a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't that seem strange to\nyou?\nMR. DREEBEN: It seemed strange to Congress,\ntoo. And when this case threw a spotlight on that\nomission in the statute, Congress didn't react --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would suggest that it throws\na spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong. It\ndoesn't --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't make -- it\ndoesn't make any sense to make unlawful the asking of\nsomebody to do something which is, itself, not unlawful,\nso that the person could do it, but if you asked them to\ndo it, you're guilty, he's not guilty. And that's -- that\nis weird.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. DREEBEN: What was weird about it, Justice\nScalia, is that it allowed the person to do it himself.\nAnd when Congress --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let me ask you about\nthis precise thing. Is it Mr. Duncan? If he had,\nhimself, shredded the documents, or destroyed them, that\nwas perfectly okay at the time it was done.\nMR. DREEBEN: It wasn't --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that right?\nMR. DREEBEN: -- prohibited by this statute.\nAnd when --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would not have been a\nviolation.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the Government got the\nconviction, got him to plead guilty, apparently, on the\nbasis that if he asked somebody else to do what was\nperfectly lawful for him to do, it would violate the\nstatute.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what -- how do you read\nthat in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor\nprovision for legal advice and so on?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that the safe-harbor\nprovision substantially bears on this case at all. First\nof all, Arthur Andersen never raised the safe-harbor\nprovision, so that the Government would --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And the woman lawyer never\nraised it, is that right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Nancy Temple was not a defendant\nin this case, but her conduct was at issue, because, after\nhaving immediately recognized that an SEC investigation\nwas highly probable, Nancy Temple sends out a document\nreminder saying --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- basically, \"purge the files.\"\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But under this statute, with\nthe safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her,\nas a lawyer, to say, \"You can destroy these documents\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, it is, in this case, if her\nintent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your definition of\n\"subvert, undermine\" is, if you destroy any document that\nmight raise a question, say, in the IRS audit. It seems\nto me that is a sweeping position, which will cause\nproblems for every major corporation or small business in\nthis country. I just -- I just don't understand it.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause the Government's position here has never been that\nthe mere existence of a document-destruction policy used\nunder routine circumstances is a violation of the statute.\nWhat the Government focused on in this case was using a\ndocument-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to\nclean up and purge files when a government investigation\nwas anticipated and it was perceived that these materials\nwould be relevant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's like in -- the\nold -- the rule in the Army, \"Make two copies of\neverything you throw out.\" I mean, that's what they're\ngoing to have to do.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You used words --\nMR. DREEBEN: Under this statute, Justice\nKennedy, that's not the issue. I think the timeline here\nis critical. This was not a company that was routinely\nexercising a document-destruction policy, or document-\nretention policy, to maintain only that which was\nnecessary for its ongoing business.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it was. The training\nsession that you introduced in evidence was precisely\nthat, a general training session for all employees,\nsaying, \"This is our document,\" quote, \"retention policy.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but that was triggered, in\npart, by Nancy Temple's recognition -- in the midst of\nserving on a crisis response team, recognizing that Enron\nwas in the process of imploding, Arthur Andersen, which\nwas basically on probation with the SEC -- because it had\nbeen previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior\nsummer, and was under a cease and desist order -- and\nseeing the SEC coming down the pike, at that moment, she\ndecides to remind the Enron team, which had not been at\nall compliant with this document-retention policy, \"It's\ntime to get the files in line.\" This wasn't because all\nof a sudden the company had become preoccupied with\nneatness; it was so that it could document, in its audit\nwork papers, those things that supported its conclusions.\nThat's what its document policy said.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He says that occurred before\nEnron had even gotten a letter.\nMR. DREEBEN: But not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That meeting.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- not before Enron's problems had\nbegun to become -- surfacing in the Wall Street Journal,\nin the financial press, the stock price was sliding.\nEverybody who was sophisticated in this environment -- and\nsurely Arthur Andersen was -- knew that when a Fortune 500\ncompany is looking at a potential need to restate its\nincome statements because the accountants have been --\nproved a black-and-white violation of GAAP, and they all\nknew that that was true, that SEC proceedings are likely\nto occur. Even the witness --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you -- if you had alleged\nthat they did this in order to cover up a fraud, there\nwould be no problem. But what you're doing is to say it's\nillegal to do what every other company in the country can\ndo if they don't have an audit immediately on the horizon.\nI just don't understand it.\nMR. DREEBEN: No other company in the country\nwould do this, Justice Kennedy. This is an extraordinary\ncase precisely because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that it would be\nperfectly okay for this company, or any other one, to\ndestroy their documents. What's bad is telling somebody\nto destroy the documents.\nMR. DREEBEN: But in an organizational context,\nthat's the only way that directives like this can be given\nout and implemented. This wasn't a case of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you know that the --\nyou've put your finger on a problem for me. You have\nsaid, Would it be the case that a person, before the\nproceeding begins, could simply tell somebody else to\ndestroy the smoking gun? I understand that you fear that\nAndersen's approach would lead to that result. And it's\nbothering me. Therefore, I'd like you whether the word\n\"corruptly\" could include a person who knows three things:\none, that the investigation, which has not yet started,\nalmost certainly will want this document; two, there is no\nlegal right to withhold it; and, three, that if I tell him\nto do it, it will be destroyed -- I mean, that it's\nimportant to the investigation. Important to the\ninvestigation, they want it, it's cover-up, and they will,\nin fact, have no legal right to take it back. Now, would\nthat be \"corrupt\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, it would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- be \"corrupt.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. IF that's \"corrupt,\"\nthen does that cover this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that it does cover this\ncase, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How? Because it seems to me\nthere was quite a lot of -- by the way, the person who's\ndoing the persuading has to know this. They have to know\nthat it will be wanted, that it's important, and there is\nno legal right to withhold it. So it seems to me that, on\nthe one hand, that does cover your problem, and, on the\nother hand, it does not cover this case. Now, that's what\nI'd like you to reply to.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think that\nthe facts of the case are subsumed within the description\nthat you've given. The jury instructions did not require\nfindings on all of those features; and that is, in large\npart, because of the kinds of instructions that Arthur\nAndersen --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The jury instruction left\nout the word \"corruptly,\" as far as I can see, in the part\nthat was critical. They define \"corruptly\" as simply an\nintent to impede. And the word \"impede\" goes well beyond\nwhat I've said, both because it does not cover the three\nthings, but, most particularly, because it does not say\nthat it was dishonest or that the person who did the\npersuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the\ninvestigation would have the legal right to get the\nmaterial and there was no right to withhold it. The words\nthat Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say\nprecisely that, were at least a step in the right\ndirection.\nMR. DREEBEN: The jury instruction said less\nthan what you have suggested, Justice Breyer, no question\nabout it, but what they did require was that there be an\nintent to undermine, subvert, or impede the investigation.\nI think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't -- wasn't that\ninstruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be\nthe instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of\nwhat was being done was no defense? I mean, if you had an\ninstruction that depended upon the word \"subvert,\" I could\n-- I could understand your argument. But it seems to me\nthat the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty\nwith your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond\n\"subvert\" to merely \"impede,\" and it included an\ninstruction that good faith was no defense.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, this is to\nstatute, and the word \"corruptly\" is not a word, that has\nbeen ever construed to require consciousness of\nillegality. That is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about \"knowingly\"?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yeah, the word \"knowingly.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How about \"knowingly\"? Does\nthat -- does that usually connote knowledge of the\nillegality?\nMR. DREEBEN: Definitely not. The word\n\"knowingly\" usually connotes knowledge of the underlying\nfacts. And, in this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Knowingly corruptly.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: The word \"knowingly\" does not\ntravel down the statute to modify \"corruptly.\" It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see why it doesn't. I\nmean, there's no grammatical break.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there is a logical break,\nbecause if it travel down the statute and reach all the\nway to \"misleading conduct,\" what Congress would have\nwritten is a statute, when you read the definition of\n\"misleading conduct,\" that says, \"whoever knowingly\nknowingly makes a false statement,\" because the definition\nof misleading conduct includes \"knowingly making false\nstatements,\" \"knowingly omitting things,\" \"intentionally\nengaging in deceptive behavior.\" And you'd end up with a\n-- in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever.\nIt makes sense for Congress to have said,\n\"knowingly used force or intimidation.\" But then when you\nget to the word \"threat,\" there is inherent knowledge in\nit. \"Corruptly\" inherently embodies knowledge. And the\ndefinition of \"misleading conduct\" inherently --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's certainly --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- embodies knowledge.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I will -- I will grant\nyou that the definition that the Government asked for, and\ngot, for \"corruptly persuades,\" does have that\nimplication, so far as the \"subvert\" prong is concerned.\nBut when you get beyond the \"subvert\" prong, and you get\ndown to the third one, \"merely to impede,\" you're getting\npretty thin, so far as the -- as the implication of\nknowledge of wrongdoing is concerned, and you've still go\nthe problem of the instruction that negated good faith is\na defense.\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me try to address each of\nthose. First of all, the words were used as a definition\nof \"improper purpose,\" and they were used together,\n\"subvert, undermine, or impede,\" and they logically have a\nrelationship to each other. When the Court of Appeals\nlooked at those words and defined them, which it did, it\ntalked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining\nof the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that\nthe Government was anticipated to make. And I think,\n\"impede\" has to be read logically in that group. Now, I\nwill acknowledge that \"impeding\" can have broader\nconnotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the\nobstruction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why did -- if that is so, why\ndid you need it? In other words, you had a -- you had a\npattern instruction, apparently, that was -- that was\nkeyed to \"subversion,\" which I think would be an easy\nargument for you. If the addition of \"impede\" really\nwasn't adding that much, why did you ask the Court to put\nit in there?\nMR. DREEBEN: Here is what it adds, Justice\nSouter. \"Undermine\" and \"subvert\" have a connotation of\ncompletely preventing the performance of the official duty\nin the proceeding. \"Impede\" removes any implication that\nyou need to totally thwart the government activity in\norder to be guilty of this crime. It's enough to\n\"interfere\" with it, which is the word that the Court of\nAppeals used to define it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you could\nundermine and be unsuccessful. It's not as though\nundermine means that you're necessarily going to succeed.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but it was to avoid any\nconnotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of\nthose words that the Government sought the use of the word\n\"impede.\" And I should note that it appears, in Section\n1503, Section 1505 --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But not in 1512.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. That's correct.\nBut what --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's not there.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- what the Government was doing\nin this instance was attempting to give content to the\nword \"corruptly\" that would enable the jurors to know that\nthey can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in\ndusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext\nto destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-\nfinding ability of an anticipated proceeding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but it sounds like --\nactually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute,\nbut that's, in a sense, my problem. The statute talks\nabout \"corruptly persuading another person to destroy a\npaper with the intent to impair that paper's availability\nfor use in an official proceeding.\" So, then we look at\nthe instruction, and the instruction speaks of \"destroying\nthe paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede.\"\nFine. It sounds like it's just the same as the statute,\nbut for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the\nword \"corruptly.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, it's a definition\nof \"corruptly\" that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So to define\n\"corruptly\" as \"doing the same thing that the rest of the\nstatute does\" seems a little strange. If I were a juror,\nI might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of\npurpose.\nMR. DREEBEN: The Court of Appeals addressed the\nargument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of\n\"corruptly\" that was used in this case is redundant and\nsuperfluous in light of the additional intent that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not perfectly redundant.\nOne can imagine driving a wedge between making something\nunavailable, which the jury would find relevant, or the\ninvestigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact-\nfinding ability of the investigator. They're not\nlogically identical, but they do strike me as so similar\nthat it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a\ndifference between those two phrases.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that they have a\nvery significant difference, an important function in\nensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope\nof protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is\nwhat Congress intended it to do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge\nme to go back to a previous answer you gave? I'm sorry, I\ndidn't quite get it. In responding to Justice Souter's\ninquiry concerning the word \"knowingly,\" you said the word\n\"knowingly\" appears later, so that it would be -- it would\nbe reduplicative. What later appearance are you talking\nabout, in 1512(b)?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, on page 5(a) --\nor, I'm sorry, on page 3(a) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 3(a), right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- of the Government's appendix --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- to its brief, at the bottom of\nthe page, subsection (b) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- appears, \"Whoever knowingly\nuses intimidation or physical force\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- et cetera.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: The last phrase in the sequence is\n\"engages in misleading conduct towards another person.\"\nThat phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page\n11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the Government's\nappendix. It's Section 1515(a)(3). And it says the term\n\"misleading conduct\" means \"knowingly making a false\nstatement; intentionally omitting information from a\nstatement; with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or\ninviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent to\nmislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a\nsample;\" and, finally, \"knowingly using a trick scheme or\ndevice.\"\nSo, \"knowingly\" is to be read in as if it were\npart of Section 1512 when it comes to defining the term\n\"engaging in misleading conduct,\" so you would end up with\na statute that Congress have, for some reason, drafted\nthat includes the word \"knowingly\" at the beginning, and\nthen \"knowingly\" later as the definition of one of the\nterms that the initial \"knowingly\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't know how you can\navoid that.\nMR. DREEBEN: You avoid it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Whoever knowingly engages in\nmisleading conduct,\" which is later defined as --\nMR. DREEBEN: No. It's, \"Whoever knowingly uses\nintimidation or physical force.\" That's what \"knowingly\"\napplies to. And then the words \"threaten, corruptly\npersuade, and engages in misleading conduct,\" have\ninherent knowledge in them. In other words --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. The \"knowingly\"\nonly applies to \"uses intimidation or physical force.\"\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right, because \"corruptly\"\nis, and always has been, a scienter term, and its\nappearance in Section 1512 is a direct lineal descendant\nfrom the fact that that word appears in Section 1503.\nWhen Congress enacted this statute, it had every reason to\nbelieve, because it intended to do this, that the\ndefinition of \"corruptly,\" that had been fairly widespread\nin the use of the word in Section 1503, would be applied\nto 1512.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why --\nMR. DREEBEN: And, in that context --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- why isn't the answer to your\nargument that the requirement in (b) -- \"knowingly\"\nrequirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down through\nthe series, but it travels at least as far as \"corruptly\npersuades\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's sort of reading the\nstatute just to achieve a result.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we know it --\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's contrary to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- applies to something at the\nbeginning of the series. It's got -- it's got some work\nto do. You've made an argument that it doesn't apply, or\nit would be logically absurd to apply it, to something at\nthe end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle.\nAnd why isn't the answer to your argument simply to say,\n\"Okay, it doesn't travel all the way to the end, but it\ntravels up to the end, and it travels as far as this\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: Because a \"threat,\" itself, which\nis the third term in the series, and the one that precedes\nthe term that's at issue here, also involves an element of\nscienter or knowledge. You can use intimidation\ninadvertently. You could be a very heavy, dangerous-\nlooking guy, standing out in front of the grand jury room,\nand a witness might come along and see you and realize, to\nhimself, \"Uh-oh, I'm in trouble if I testify.\" If you\nhaven't done that knowingly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that big, heavy guy\nwould violate the statute just by standing there?\nMR. DREEBEN: He wouldn't, Chief Justice\nRehnquist, precisely because it requires that he knowingly\nuse intimidation. So that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you can -- you\ncan use intimidation unknowingly, any more than you can\nthreaten unknowingly. If they felt it necessary to put\n\"knowingly\" before \"use intimidation,\" I think they would\nhave felt it necessary to put \"knowingly\" before\n\"threaten.\" The two terms are just about identical.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that they're\nactually quite different in the context of this statute,\nbut even if the Court were to conclude that \"knowingly\"\ndid travel down and produce a phrase, \"knowingly\ncorruptly,\" the word \"knowingly\" generally in the criminal\nlaw refers to \"knowledge of the facts that make your\nconduct unlawful.\" Arthur Andersen here is asking for a\nvery --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, the --- in general terms,\nwhen you speak of \"general interpretation,\" I suppose I\nthink it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes\nwith the following idea. Congress did not intend to try\nto make of the statute a highly general weapon for the\nJustice Department to pick and choose. That's a\nnotification problem. It's also because we don't want one\nlaw, \"It is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the\nAttorney General.\" You know, I mean, we want to have\nnarrow criminal statutes.\nNow, is it reasonable to start with that frame\nof mind? And if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against\nyou in this case?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it does,\nJustice Breyer. There are, of course, contexts where the\nCourt concludes that a statute, after applying all the\ntools of statutory construction, is ambiguous, and then\nrules of construction do apply to narrow it; but there is\nno provision that says that the Court should approach the\nquestion of construction with a view to narrow it. I\nthink --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, how about the rule of\nlenity in the criminal statutes? If this thing is so\nconfusing, how's the business person supposed to know what\nthey can do? How's the lawyer supposed to know?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it is that\nconfusing, Justice O'Connor. This is a statute that was\nenacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-\nunderstood meaning of the word \"corruptly.\" The same word\nappears in Section 1505. When the D.C. Circuit concluded\nthat that provision was vague, as applied to a particular\ncase, Congress came back with a definition that\nlegislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said\n\"corruptly\" means \"acting with an improper purpose.\" The\n\"improper purpose\" in an obstruction-of-justice case has\ntraditionally been \"the purpose to obstruct justice.\"\nThat definition logically applies to Section\n1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades\nprovision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it\nhad not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-\ntampering in the statute, originally. And some courts\nconcluded that it was no longer punishable under Section\n1503, either.\nTo fix that situation, Congress looked to the model\nof Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety\nof acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test\nwould not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering\na witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the\nwitness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying\ndocuments before a subpoena had been issued, but in an\nanticipation that the subpoena was likely. Those kinds of\nacts were considered to be unlawful.\nSimilarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to\nan individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith,\nnot to protect that individual's own interest, but to\nobstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal\norganization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts\nhad recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had\nrecognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the\ntime of the enactment of this statute. And Congress\nspecifically said, \"We want 1512 to be able to pick up the\nkinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer\nprosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been\nincluded in the original version of 1512.\" So that there\nis history here that explains how these terms should be\napplied.\nAnd as far as Petitioner's contention that the\nword \"corruptly\" does nothing and leads to a series of\nhorrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and\nappropriate use of the word \"corruptly\" solves those\nproblems. Petitioners talk about how people should be\nable to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary\ninvestigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to\nengage in those conversations. But if an entity has\nsubpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply\ninvites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going\nto be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that\nproceeding to invite them to exercise that right. If the\nagency wants their testimony, it can get it through\ncompulsion.\nSimilarly, Petitioners argue that document\npolicies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's\napproach. But as the Court of Appeals specifically\nrecognized in this case, a sound application of the word\n\"corruptly\" would look to whether there is a threat of\nsome kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an\nobligation not to destroy the documents before the\nproceeding gets started.\nAnd, as well, there are intents that are simply\nnot intents to subvert the administration of justice, that\nmay result in rendering certain evidence unavailable. And\nif a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate\nanother provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to\nviolate 1512. And a sound use of \"corruptly\" prevents all\nof those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to\nthe conclusion that the statute is unduly broad.\nNow, Petitioner in this case, in addition to\nattacking the word \"corruptly,\" also has advanced a number\nof arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some\nconnection that had to be required between the Defendant's\nintent in a possible future proceeding. But the reason\nthat there was no adequate instruction on those issues is\nlargely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided\nto ask for two instructions that were contrary to the\nstatute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to\nimpose today. It never asked that the Defendant must be\nshown to believe that some particular proceeding was\nlikely to occur in the near future. Instead, what it did\nis say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair\nan object's availability for use in a particular\nproceeding. And what the Court of Appeals said is that if\nthere was any problem in that, it's not reversible error;\nit's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding\nthat was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron.\nAnd the other instruction that Petitioners asked\nfor in the District Court is that the official proceeding\nmust be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the\nfuture. But that instruction is flatly contrary to the\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nDreeben.\nMs. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. MAHONEY: Thank you.\nI'd like to first address the fact that much of\nthe Government's argument is focused on this nexus, the\nimminence of the proceeding, that sort of thing, but\nactually the jury was not required to find any nexus\nwhatsoever, and was told the wrong definition of an\n\"official proceeding,\" to boot. It was told that the\ninformal inquiry by the SEC staff was an official\nproceeding, and that an official proceeding was already\ngoing on at the time of the events at issue here; in fact,\neven before Nancy Temple even knew about that informal\ninquiry, which, in and of itself, is reversible error.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you think it should\nhave been?\nMS. MAHONEY: The \"official proceeding,\" at\nworst, Your Honor, it was the formal investigation of the\nSEC, which is commenced by a vote of the Commission and\nhas compulsory process available. It is certainly not a\nstaff person sitting in their office in Houston opening a\nfile and doing some Internet searches. That's the\nGovernment's definition. That's in -- a matter within the\njurisdiction of an agency, and that's not the language\nthat appears in this statute.\nAlso, in terms of whether Andersen raised this\nargument, of course they did. They asked for an\ninstruction that the proceeding be ongoing or scheduled,\nbecause that was Fifth Circuit law at the time. Andersen\nwasn't supposed to guess that the Fifth Circuit was going\nto change what it had held in case called Shively. And\nthe Fifth Circuit understood that Andersen had preserved\nthe argument, and expressly says in its opinion that the\nissue is, What is the concreteness of the Defendant's\nexpectation of a proceeding that should be required under\nthis statute? -- and found that \"feared\" was enough.\nThat's not enough. \"Possible\" is not enough, especially\nif a broad definition, like the one the Government wants\nto have -- there's got to be a serious nexus.\nNexus problems can be avoided, though, if the\nmore traditional definition of \"corruptly\" is used in the\nfirst place, which is not only required by lenity, but,\nfrankly, is required even by the witness-tampering cases\nunder Section 1503. As I read to you, the definitions of\n\"corruptly\" are completely consistent with Andersen's\ndefinition.\nThe Government says, \"Oh, no. In fact, all it\nmeant under 1503 was an intent to obstruct justice.\" That\ncan't possibly be what Congress intended for Section 1512,\nbecause this Court had held, for -- a hundred years ago,\nthat you necessarily lack the evil intent to obstruct if a\nproceeding is not pending. And 1512 does apply even\nbefore proceedings begin, so the definition had to be\ntailored to the precise circumstances of Section 1512. It\ncouldn't import the precise thing.\nPlus, the definition under 1503 has never been\nany intent to impede the fact-finding ability is a\nprohibited intent. That would require lawyers and clients\nall over the country to go to jail. It's that you intend\nto subvert and undermine the integrity of the due\nadministration of justice. And that term does not mean\nsimply to impede the fact-finding; it means that you\nintend to disobey those duties that are imposed upon you\nin the course of a proceeding. And cases, including the\nHoward case cited in our brief and cited by the\nGovernment, make that crystal clear. It is not translated\nto what this jury instruction was, which is that -- any\nintent to impede fact-finding.\nJust take a look at the examples, if the\nGovernment were correct about this. If I were to ask my\nlawyer to assert, let's say, a reporter's privilege that\nis debatable, under the Government's -- and I do it,\nbecause I know that that document is harmful, and I want\nto keep it out of the proceeding -- under the Government's\ndefinition, that is corrupt, because I am trying to get\nanother person to withhold a document in order to impede\nthe fact-finding ability of the decision-maker.\nIt makes no sense to define \"corruptly\" that\nway. If you, instead, define it with reference to duties,\nit makes perfect sense. That's not corrupt, because there\nis no duty to provide a document when you have a good-\nfaith claim of privilege.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\n[Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
