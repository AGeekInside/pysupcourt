        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now\nin No. 02-964, George Baldwin v. Michael Reese.\nGeneral Myers.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. HARDY MYERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MYERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhen a state prisoner decides to attack his\nconviction on the basis of a claimed violation of Federal\nconstitutional right, your cases have held that he must\nfirst alert the state courts he is raising a Federal\nclaim, if that claim is to be exhausted for Federal habeas\npurposes. But what the prisoner must say to the state\ncourts to tell them he is raising a Federal claim\ncontinues to be a - a troubled area of Federal habeas law.\nIt is one that has divided the circuits and is producing\nvery different analyses and results.\nSome cases are holding that the prisoner must\nmake some explicit citation or reference to the Federal\nsource of his claim. Some cases are holding that a\nFederal claim has been fairly presented even when - even\nthough what the prisoner is saying to the state courts\ncould as - as - as reasonably be interpreted as stating a\nstate law claim. And some courts have held that a Federal\nclaim is fairly presented even when the statement of the\nclaim is clearly a claim under state law only.\nThis continuing - and in this - in this case -\nQUESTION: Well, we're reviewing a Ninth Circuit\nholding, which seems fairly open-ended. How would you\ncharacterize the Ninth Circuit rule?\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, I was about to describe\nit is a transformation of the responsibility of the state\nprisoner to present his claim, a transformation of that\ninto a responsibility of the - of the state court - state\ncourts to, in effect, step into the shoes of the state\nprisoner and complete or try to complete an incompletely\npresented claim.\nThis - this overall division among the circuits\nand this case from the Ninth Circuit, we think, Your\nHonors, illustrates or confirms very strongly the need for\nfurther clarification by this Court as to exactly what\nmust be said by -\nQUESTION: Well, do you agree with your opponents\nhere on at least some of the ground rules that would\nsuffice? I mean, is it enough to cite a Federal\nconstitutional provision or a Federal statute or other\nprovision describing the right as Federal? You're both in\nagreement that would do?\nMR. MYERS: Yes. We believe that is so, so long\nas -\nQUESTION: How about if you cite at least a - a\nreported case that has decided the claim on a Federal\nbasis? You make your claim and cite a case that -\nMR. MYERS: Yes -\nQUESTION: - clearly has decided the claim on a\nFederal basis. Is that - you're both in agreement that\nwould do?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honors, so -\nQUESTION: And what if a - a claim is spelled out\nthat necessarily must be based on a Federal right to exist\nat all?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor, that is part of the\ntest that we propose -\nQUESTION: Why yes? I don't understand that.\nmean, why is it necessarily a Federal claim? It's\nnecessarily a Federal claim only if it's a valid claim.\nIt might be an erroneous state claim.\nMR. MYERS: Well, we are referring to\nnecessarily, Your Honor, in the sense that the - the\nsource of the claim, that is its Federal source, is -\nQUESTION: Who -\nQUESTION: But the - the -\nMR. MYERS: - is unmistake -\nQUESTION: He hasn't read the state constitution.\nHe - he makes a due process claim. Now, you're - you're\ngoing to say, since there is no Due Process Clause in the\nstate constitution, but there is in the Federal\nConstitution, we must assume it's a Federal claim. Why?\nIt may be an erroneous state claim.\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, we think that the state\ncourt -\nQUESTION: And I don't want to have to go through\nthe trouble of figuring out whether there's a valid state\nclaim. I - I mean, this is going to require a Federal\ncourt every time there's such a claim to go through state\nlaw and determine whether there is anything to this under\nstate law. Why should - why should we do that? Why, I\nmean, why aren't your first two requirements enough? Look\nat - cite a Federal case, cite a Federal provision. Is -\nis this an enormous burden?\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, and we would be quite\ncontent -\nQUESTION: So why do you want to add anything to\nit? I - I don't - I don't really understand going beyond\nthat.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you the other - the\ncontrary question. Suppose the - the prisoner alleges, I\nhad a lawyer who didn't even graduate from law school, and\nbecause I had such a law - lousy lawyer, I lost the case\nand I'm in jail, and I would be innocent if I were not in\njail, but he doesn't cite any cases or any constitutional\nprovision. Would that have - present a Federal claim?\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor. Inasmuch as -\nQUESTION: You don't think so?\nMR. MYERS: Not - not necessarily -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but if he added, and therefore,\nit violated the Federal Constitution, then it would be a\nFederal claim?\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, it would - the - a\nFederal source of the claim would have been identified,\nbut, of course, whatever further clarification the Court\nmight consider adopting or adopt, the balance of the\nstatement of the claim also has to meet the requirements\nof fair presentation.\nQUESTION: But why - why doesn't the state judge\nknow he's raising a claim of inadequate assistance of\ncounsel that violates the Federal Constitution? Doesn't\nthat give the state judge a fair opportunity to decide the\nFederal question?\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, because the\ndescription of the claim that you just gave, apart from\nwhether it's factually adequate or whatever could as -\ncould equally address, or state a claim under state law.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly -\nQUESTION: But that anybody knows -\nQUESTION: - but the question is whether it\nstates a Federal claim that has been exhausted. Doesn't\nit also state a Federal claim?\nMR. MYERS: Not necessarily, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I - I thought the Federal standards -\nand I was going to get into this, but let's do it in\nrelation to Justice Stevens' hypothetical - I thought the\nFederal standards and the state standards for adequate\nassistance of counsel were - were in substance the same,\nand in, you know, in Oregon. And - and if they are the\nsame, why is it unfair to the state or to the state courts\nto construe a - a - a statement like the one Justice\nStevens just read, as stating a Federal as well as a state\nclaim? The court is going to do the same thing no matter\nhow it construes it.\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, when state judicial\nauthority is invoked to address a claim before it, it's of\nparamount importance for that court to know whether it is\naddressing a state claim -\nQUESTION: No, my -\nQUESTION: Well, we - we need to lay down a rule,\nI think, that is - can be applied generally and not just\nto Oregon, so that, of course, a peculiarity of Oregon law\nought not to control what we're trying to do in making a\nmore general statement.\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, and I would like to -\nQUESTION: May - maybe I didn't make my - my\npoint. My - my point was, if a claim is stated as a\nmatter of fact, which under the law of the state and the\nlaw of the United States is governed by identical\nstandards, what is unfair about construing that as a\nFederal as well as a state claim, regardless of what label\nis put on it?\nMR. MYERS: And, Your Honor, as I was saying a\nfew moments ago, it - the answer to that goes to the fact\n- or rests on the fact that the state court's authority to\naddress a state law-based claim is very different, of\ncourse, from its authority to address a Federal law-based\nclaim. It has the ability to judge and decide the state\nlaw claim any way it - it thinks is correct under state\nlaw. It must, of course, in the relation to a Federal\nclaim, follow the precedents faithfully of this Court -\nQUESTION: No, but I'm - my - the - the - my - my\nquestion assumed that the - that the substantive law\ngoverning the claim was the same under - under the state\nsystem and under the Federal system. So my assumption is\nthat you're going to get the same result, and the result\nis going to be equally right or equally wrong, regardless\nof - of - of whether you construe it as a state claim and\na Federal claim.\nMR. MYERS: But, Your Honor, the - the - the\nauthority issue is crucial, because if the state court\ndoes not know whether it, in fact, has a state law claim\nbefore it, it does not know whether it has the prerogative\nin that case to change the rule.\nQUESTION: Suppose -\nQUESTION: Well, it -\nQUESTION: - Oregon had said in prior decisions,\nas states sometimes do in dealing with constitutional\nprovisions, we interpret inadequate assistance of counsel\nin our state to be strictly in tune with the way the\nSupreme Court interprets inadequate or ineffective\nassistance of counsel. That is, our state standard is the\nsame, identical, to the Federal, so there isn't any doubt\nabout there being a difference between the state law and\nthe Federal law. The - the state supreme court has said,\nwe take our lead from the Federal definition.\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, I - I would still assert\nrespectfully that the - the - the clarity with which the\nclaim is presented in terms of making clear whether there\nis a state claim or a Federal claim present is still of\ngreat importance, because the state court can still change\nits decision with respect to the state claim if it is a\nstate claim.\nQUESTION: Sure it can, but the question is, what\ndoes it know when it sets out to adjudicate the case? Is\nit fairly on notice at day one on a premise like Justice\nGinsburg's that the claim is equally state or Federal?\nAnd it seems to me that on a premise like hers, of course\nthe state can fairly say the law is the same, doesn't\nmatter at this point whether - whether I call it state or\nwhether I call it Federal, so it's fair to assume it's\nboth.\nIf the state court, let's say the state supreme\ncourt, later on says, we think we'll change our rule, then\nall the state court has to do is to say, the claim is\neither good or bad under Federal law and this - the result\nis now going to be different under state law. But the\nstate courts at each stage on a premise like Justice\nGinsburg is fairly on notice of what it has to decide.\nThere's no unfairness to it. That's the point that we're\ngetting at, and I - and I don't understand your answer\nwhen you say it's important for them to know the source if\nthere's no unfairness.\nMR. MYERS: Well, Your Honor, with respect, we do\nthink that there is unfairness if it is not absolutely and\nexplicitly clear to the court that a Federal claim is\nbeing presented by a state court.\nQUESTION: You mean because it's just nice to\nknow?\nMR. MYERS: No, because it -\nQUESTION: It doesn't make any difference in the\nlaw. It doesn't make any difference in - in the standards\nby which they would go about adjudicating it.\nMR. MYERS: But it could, in the sense that they\nmight want to change their position or interpretation with\nrespect to state law.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that - the change in position\nto allow the claim. But we're only concerned with cases\nin which the state has denied relief. If you could - if\nthe state grants relief, there's no exhaustion problem.\nHe got the relief.\nMR. MYERS: That's true, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And so if he's denied relief without\nknowing whether it's Federal or state, is there any\npossibility that if it were refiled, and clearly named\nFederal Constitution as the background, he would then\ngrant relief?\nMR. MYERS: I'm not sure, Your Honor. I don't\nthink so.\nQUESTION: I don't see how it could possibly\nhappen. If the rules are the same, he made a\nconscientious examination, they claim, and said, you lose.\nIf he came back and added the words, cited some Federal\ncase, he'd still lose. So why hasn't the state had a fair\nopportunity to consider that claim and the interests of\nFederal is in par not, why are they not accommodated by\nthat - by just saying, if you - if you made a claim that's\nclearly Federal on its facts and you've had a chance to\ndecide it, why - why shouldn't that - that not count - be\nsufficient exhaustion?\nMR. MYERS: Well, because we think at - again,\nYour Honor, we think - not only do I still feel the\nauthority issue, very respectfully, is important, but also\nour whole approach toward fair presentation of Federal\nclaims places a choice on the petitioner to make as to\nwhether or not to assert a Federal claim.\nQUESTION: General Myers, doesn't the burden on\nthe habeas court have anything to do with this? If - if\nthis hypothesis is adopted, the habeas court will have to,\nI suppose, consider the facts and determine whether that\nstatement of facts makes out a Federal claim or not, thing\none. Thing two, the Federal habeas court will then have\nto examine state court, a state law, to assure itself that\nstate law and Federal law, with regard to this matter, are\nexactly the same.\nAnd all of this is in order to save the habeas\npetitioner what burden? The burden of saying Federal\nclaim when he files his - his complaint. What - does it\nseem to you a close question who should bear that burden?\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: How often are these habeas -\nMR. MYERS: There is -\nQUESTION: - petitioners represented by counsel\nin Oregon? Is this - are - is counsel regularly appointed\nfor Federal habeas petitioners?\nMR. MYERS: For Federal habeas?\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MYERS: Yes, I - well, like indigent Federal\nhabeas, yes, I believe so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You don't know that?\nQUESTION: In - in the state courts?\nMR. MYERS: Oh, I'm sorry. I - I -\nQUESTION: In - in the Federal court you think\nthey're routinely appointed by the state?\nMR. MYERS: No, not -\nQUESTION: A Federal habeas petitioner?\nMR. MYERS: In Federal court, no, Your Honor.\nThey - they are -\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. MYERS: They would -\nQUESTION: It would be up to the Federal rules.\nMR. MYERS: - they would probably be Federal,\nyes. But they are -\nQUESTION: And must - must the petitioner seeking\nhabeas relief also fairly present the factual basis for\nthe claim?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Was that done here?\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And did the state point that out\nalone?\nMR. MYERS: No, Your Honor. In the - in the\nhabeas proceedings in the district court, we focused\nsolely on the issue of the adequacy of that - of the\nidentification of the claim as Federal in nature.\nQUESTION: Well, but if the petition contains no\nfacts, you wouldn't point that out? I - I don't\nunderstand.\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't you say, but there are no\nfacts?\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, in this case, we made a\nchoice to concentrate or focus on the issue of the - of\nthe sufficiency of the - of the identification of the\nclaim as Federal, and we maintained that as the focus and\nthat was the - the focus of the petition, of course, for -\nQUESTION: And you want us to decide this case on\nthe assumption that facts were presented when indeed none\nwere?\nMR. MYERS: In this case, yes, Your Honor,\ninasmuch as we have not appealed from - we have not made\nthat an issue below and appealed from it. We have asked\nfor review solely confined to the issue of the adequate -\nthe adequacy of the - of the sufficiency of the - of the\nidentification of the claim as Federal in nature. If I\ncould -\nQUESTION: May I - may I go back to the question\n-\nQUESTION: Just to make it clear where - where\nyour - what your rule is, the very asset Justice O'Connor\nsaid, does it suffice if you cite a constitutional\nprovision, a case, a - a formulation. And then we had\nanother discussion, but that was only part of your test,\nbecause you also, I take it, assert that you - that the\npetitioner must set forth the factual basis for its claim\n- for his claim?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So that that's a two-part test. It -\nand it seems to me that in some cases it's going to be\nfairly obvious what the facts are and in some cases it's\nfairly obvious what the legal standard is, and depending.\nIn the case that Justice Stevens puts, where he alleges\njust the facts that his - that his lawyer was not even a\nlawyer and - and indicates why it was ineffective, but -\nbut doesn't cite a Federal provision, it seems to me any\njudge knows you have to have adequate assistance of\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment, and that in the case\nput by Justice Stevens, it is simply a formalistic\nrequirement.\nNow, it may be that you're going to say,\nalthough it's formalistic in some cases, it's necessary to\nrun the habeas system that we have this rule. Is - is -\nis the latter your position?\nMR. MYERS: It - well, Your Honor, we don't -\nyes. We don't believe that it's formalistic inasmuch as a\nclaim so described could equally describe a violation of,\nconceivably, I suppose, state statute, but certainly a\nstate constitution. And I think it's at the very heart of\nthe whole notion of - of - of Federalism or comity, as\napplied in habeas, that this Court enforce the reality\nthat we have state constitutions that are offering\nprotections -\nQUESTION: We certainly enforce it with respect\nto people raising claims in our Court. We require very\nspecifically that they refer to a specific source of\nFederal law before we will even decide it.\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor. I would -\nQUESTION: How does the case decided, the\nFitzgerald case, which is cited in page 34 of the red\nbrief, it was just last term, when - when this Court said\nthat the Court would consider a state court decision as\nrelying on Federal grounds sufficient to support this\nCourt's jurisdiction, if under the state's decisional law,\nthe state and the Federal constitutional claim are treated\nidentically, the content of the right is treated\nidentically.\nThat - that decision from just last term says,\nyou've got a claim out there and it's a constitutional\nclaim and the Federal law and state law are identical, the\ncontent of the law is identical, we will treat it as\nFederal. That was a decision just from last term.\nMR. MYERS: I - I may have misunderstood the -\nthat interpretation, Your Honor, because I thought this\nwas still a very much open question as to whether -\nQUESTION: This was not in the habeas context.\nMR. MYERS: Yes, I understand. And in the habeas\ncontext -\nQUESTION: And it - what I read to you is - is\nfrom the decision itself. The Court will consider a state\ncourt decision as relying upon Federal grounds sufficient\nto support the Court's jurisdiction. That is, when the\nstate courts have in other cases declared that they will\napply the same analysis in considering the state\nconstitutional claim as the Federal courts would, I think\nin that case it was equal protection. But the - the Court\n- that was critical to the Court's deciding that case last\nterm.\nMR. MYERS: Well, if I am understanding it\ncorrectly, Your Honor, I would very much advocate for the\nCourt not extending - I'm understanding it correctly - not\nextending that - that doctrine or view, if you will, into\nthe habeas context.\nQUESTION: It had to do with jurisdiction, not\nwith pleading. There was pled in the case a violation of\nFederal law. There was no doubt that the person before\nthe Court was claiming a violation of Federal law. What\nthe case held was that there is jurisdiction because the -\nwe will assume that the state court made a ruling on a\nquestion of Federal law where it relies on state law that\nlooks to Federal cases. That's quite different from the\npleading question that you have before you.\nQUESTION: May I ask you what you understand to\nbe the purpose of the exhaustion requirement?\nMR. MYERS: It is, Your Honor, to assure that the\nstates have a meaningful first response - opportunity to\nconsider Federal attacks on their convictions, and to -\nQUESTION: Do you - do you think the hypothetical\nthat I gave you would give a state court a meaningful\nopportunity to decide the Federal question?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then it would seem we would follow the\nexhaustion requirement is satisfied.\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I go back to the question of\nappointment of counsel? Is counsel routinely appointed\nfor state petitioners in the state courts of Oregon -\nMR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor, by statute -\nQUESTION: - for state habeas -\nMR. MYERS: In the post-conviction relief\nprocess, yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. MYERS: Always, by statute. There is one\nfurther reason also I'd like to mention to the Court for\nnot adopting a view that generally says, if a state\ncourt's interpretation of a particular assertion of - of a\n- of a right, and the Federal interpretation are the same,\ntherefore the Federal claim has been presented\nautomatically. And that is that I think that represents a\nvery transitory rule for the Court to adopt inasmuch as\nthe state interpretation of its own law could change at a\ngiven point in time, and thus, in a given jurisdiction,\nwhat was congruent ceases to be congruent.\nThis Court's interpretation of Federal law could\nchange so that, again, where there might have been\ncongruencies before, they - they have now become\nincongruent, and -\nQUESTION: Don't you think it's likely that\nFederal judges sitting in the state would be aware of\nthose changes?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, I think they would be aware of\nthem, Your Honor. But also to come back to a point that\nJustice Scalia made, it - there could be also renewed and\nfurther issues as to whether there has been a change,\nwhether they are congruent or not congruent -\nQUESTION: But are you thinking of changes that\nare favorable to the claimant or favorable to the state?\nMR. MYERS: Well, I think it could go either way,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: But certainly if it's favorable to the\nclaimant, it couldn't cause any harm. It's only if you\nmake it narrower that it would make a difference.\nMR. MYERS: Yes.\nQUESTION: I guess in every case where the\nFederal habeas court has some doubt whether a Federal\nclaim was raised, the Federal habeas court, that is, where\nit is not explicitly stated, the Federal habeas court will\nhave to inquire into state law to see whether it is indeed\ncongruent with Federal law. Isn't that right?\nMR. MYERS: Yes, that's correct. Any event, with\nthe present state of the law within the circuits, and in\nlight of the Ninth Circuit's decision, Your Honors, we\nvery much hope that this Court will take the opportunity\nin this case to both reaffirm that it is the petitioner's\nresponsibility to set forth, to choose and to set forth\nhis Federal claim as Federal, and that you will provide\nfurther guidance as to how that must occur. That furthers\nclarification can certainly work to serve all the\ninterests that are at stake here, a true meaningful\nopportunity for the states to be able to - to have the\nfirst opportunity to decide the Federal questions.\nIt can reduce the amount of litigation that is\noccurring around the exhaustion issue, and, I think - and\n- and save precious resources, and I think, Your Honors,\nthat a clear, further - a further clarification of the\nrule will actually serve the interests of petitioners by\nmake - bringing meritorious Federal claims to - to\ndecision more - sooner and more consistently.\nQUESTION: What was wrong with the Ninth\nCircuit's position, at least with respect to the\nintermediate appellate court? That is, it's reviewing a\ndecision of a court below. That court below has Federal\nwritten all over it. Why isn't that a - a reasonable\nassumption that the - that the intermediate appellate\ncourt where there is jurisdiction as a matter of right,\nit's reviewing a decision, it's bound to read that\ndecision?\nMR. MYERS: Actually, Your Honor, in the petition\nfor review in Oregon, the decision of the court below is\nincluded, but that in this case was a summary affirmance\nof the - of the trial court's decision.\nQUESTION: Well, you're talking about the court -\nthe Supreme Court of Oregon. I think Justice Ginsburg was\nasking about the Oregon Court of Appeals.\nMR. MYERS: Yes, that's -\nQUESTION: The - the appeal from the trial court\nto the court of appeals.\nMR. MYERS: I beg your pardon, Your Honor. Well,\ninsofar as that stage is concerned, the - the - the papers\nthat were submitted to the court of appeals did not advise\nor tell that court that a Federal question was being\nraised, a Federal claim was being raised. There was\nsimply a claim of inadequate assistance of appellate\ncounsel, but there was no indication that - whether that\nwas a state claim, state law-based claim or a Federal law-\nbased claim.\nAnd both state and Federal law-based claims of\ninadequate assistance of appellate counsel had been - had\nbeen raised in the - in the - in the petition at the trial\nstage.\nQUESTION: Do you wish to reserve the rest of\nyour time, General Myers?\nMR. MYERS: I do. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Balske, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS BALSKE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BALSKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWe have a narrow question of fair presentation\nhere, and it isn't a great effort for the courts, I don't\nbelieve, in Mr. Reese's case, to go searching to find that\nhe did fairly present. We start out by going to the PCR\npetition itself, which alleges the violation both under\nthe state and Federal Constitution. It mentions the Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendments. And then, when the -\nQUESTION: You're talking about the trial court,\ncorrect?\nMR. BALSKE: Yes, I am. And when -\nQUESTION: You have to - you agree you have to\npresent the claim all the way up through the state?\nMR. BALSKE: I do, I do. And when the trial\ncourt decides it, we go right into the Oregon clear\nstatement rule. Oregon post-conviction is designed to let\nthe appellate courts know the basis of those trial court\nrulings, so we have the clear statement rule under\n138.640.\nQUESTION: Well, there were - there were two -\nthere was a petition and an amended position, as I recall.\nMR. BALSKE: Correct.\nQUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. BALSKE: You're right.\nQUESTION: And the - the original petition did\nnot recite the - the factual basis to support the claim.\nThat was only in the amended petition, and the amended\npetition was not - the amended petition, I - I take it,\nplease correct me if I'm wrong, was - was the one in which\nthe allegation of conflict of interest and the precise\nreasons for it was cited. That seems to drop out of the\ncase because then it's not - that amended petition, which\ncontained the factual basis, is - is not incorporated or\ncited to the court of - the state court of appeals.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, well the - the way it works in\nPCR is the court, under the pleadings, decides the case\nbased on the first amended petition. That's the one that\nstates the legal basis of the claim under the Federal and\nstate Constitution. That's the one that the judgment of\nthe state trial court made and - and relied on.\nSo under the clear statement rule, then, when it\nmade its decision and cited a Federal ground, under\nOregon's clear statement rule, we have a decision on\nFederal grounds at that -\nQUESTION: No, you're - you're - you refer to a\nclear statement rule. Is that a rule of Oregon law -\nMR. BALSKE: Yes.\nQUESTION: - or a rule of Federal law?\nMR. BALSKE: That is a rule of Oregon law, and\nthat -\nQUESTION: And what does - what does it - what\ndoes that - what's the case for it, and what does it say?\nMR. BALSKE: It's not a case, it's a\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BALSKE: It's 138.640. It's at the state's\nbrief in the appendix at page 4, and it reads as follows,\nquote, the order making final disposition of the petition\nshall state clearly the grounds upon which the cause was\ndetermined, and whether a state or Federal question, or\nboth, was presented and decided.\nAnd in Mr. Reese's case, the trial court\nfollowed that rule and filed a memorandum of opinion that\ncited that its decision of the ineffectiveness claim was\non Federal grounds only. And then Mr. - then Mr. Reese\nappeals.\nQUESTION: Did - did - did the order of the\nOregon trial court specify the facts upon which the\nFederal claim was -\nMR. BALSKE: No.\nQUESTION: - was based?\nMR. BALSKE: No. But again, that's not before\nthe Court in the issue presented, and that issue was\nwaived by the state in the Ninth Circuit. They abandoned\nany position that Mr. Reese's claim wasn't sufficiently\nfactually based, and we're presented with the question of\nfair presentation, whether or not he indicated -\nQUESTION: Well, all right, but it wasn't, okay?\nI mean, I'm in an appeals court, I've a lot to do -\nMR. BALSKE: Right.\nQUESTION: - thousands of cases. There are\njudgments of all sorts below. I don't read the judgments\nwhen I have thousands of cases. I look and see, what is\nthis individual complaining about?\nMR. BALSKE: Right.\nQUESTION: So I look to see what the arguments\nare that he's making that the lower court made a mistake.\nNow, if I was in the Supreme Court of Oregon, and I\nthought, but I lost this, that you shouldn't have to\npresent it in the Supreme Court of Oregon, but the rule is\nyou do.\nMR. BALSKE: Right.\nQUESTION: All right? Well, I'm there as a busy\njudge, I look at it, he makes no mention of the Federal\nclaim, goodbye, that's the end of it. I don't look up at\nthe Federal claim. So - what - what - why - how could we\nhold to the contrary?\nMR. BALSKE: There - let - let me help you there.\nIf you will turn to the - page 44 of the joint appendix,\nwhat you're going to find there is the petition for review\nto the Oregon Supreme Court. And when you get to page 44,\nand 44 and 45 across, what you see is it follows the\nstandard form, it's in proper form, nothing more.\nBut when you turn the page, as a busy judge\nyou're scanning, as you're talking about, and you look and\nyou say, what's it about, is this a state case or a\nFederal case, look on the first page, 46, index of\nauthorities, constitutions. Only one, the Federal\nConstitution, four constitutional amendments cited, Fifth,\nSixth, Eight, Fourteenth -\nQUESTION: But all that tells me is that\nsomewhere in this brief they're cited, that's the table of\nauthorities they cite. That isn't what the argument is.\nMR. BALSKE: And - well -\nQUESTION: So if I'm going to look to see what\nthe argument is, I'll try to turn the page and -\nMR. BALSKE: A judge -\nQUESTION: - where does it say he's making the\nargument -\nMR. BALSKE: You're not going to look for an\nargument because you're an Oregon Supreme Court judge, and\nunder the Oregon Supreme Court rule, I'm - yeah,\n9.05(4)(A)(v), the petitioner only presents a brief\nargument if he wants to, it's optional. You don't put\nargument into a petition for a review, so -\nQUESTION: Do you have to have your reasons why\nthey're wrong and so on?\nMR. BALSKE: Yes, and in -\nQUESTION: Where is that?\nMR. BALSKE: - that's where we turn to the next\npage, 47, statement of legal questions presented on\nreview. We - we see on the page across from the Federal\nConstitution, ineffectiveness - ineffective assistance of\nboth trial court and appellate court counsel. The next\nparagraph, statement of reasons for reversal of court of\nappeals. Again we see ineffective assistance of both\ntrial court and appellate court counsel.\nSo, it - we're scanning it, we're busy, we're\njust trying to decide whether we're going to review the\ncase. We're not deciding it on the merits. We've got a\nFederal case. We've got a Federal issue. It's presented\nby Mr. Reese.\nQUESTION: I see.\nQUESTION: I - I couldn't possibly tell from this\nwhat - what the case was about, other than some free-\nfloating ineffective assistance of counsel case.\nMR. BALSKE: And that -\nQUESTION: And - and are you saying that Oregon\nrules make it optional as to whether he's going to tell me\nwhat the case is about?\nMR. BALSKE: Yeah, what - well, whether you're\ngoing to brief it, whether you're going to present legal\nargument. It's optional under -\nQUESTION: But there are no facts. I mean, if\nyou're in the Federal habeas court, why aren't you just\nout right there for having no facts?\nMR. BALSKE: Because the state waived that\ndefense in this case. I'm - I - that's just the way -\nQUESTION: But it - but the point is -\nMR. BALSKE: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: - as I understand my colleague's\nquestion, if the judge sees that there are no facts set\nout, why doesn't the judge just say, you're out of here?\nMR. BALSKE: The judge might say that, but the\njudge would say that in the context of a Federal question,\na Federal issue presented of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel under the Federal Constitution.\nQUESTION: But think he would say that on the\nbasis of Oregon procedural law that -\nMR. BALSKE: Well -\nQUESTION: - you - you just haven't said\nanything.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I don't - well, it's\nconjecture what they would have decided or thought.\nWhat's critical here is what was presented, the question\ntoday is what was presented versus -\nQUESTION: Okay. What - what - what is the\nhardship for a - for a petitioner in PCR Oregon -\nMR. BALSKE: Sure.\nQUESTION: - to either say, I'm relying on\nsection, you know, article XIV of the United States\nConstitution, or I'm relying on some Federal case. I\nmean, that - that just seems a very minimal requirement.\nMR. BALSKE: Well -\nQUESTION: What's - what's hard about that?\nMR. BALSKE: Well -\nQUESTION: Could - can you answer that?\nMR. BALSKE: I - I can answer it by saying that\nthe prisoners are pretty ignorant. Their lawyers in the\nstate post-conviction system, bless their souls, are not\nthe sharpest lawyers in the world.\nQUESTION: Well, you - how sharp do you have to\nbe to figure that out?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, tell you what, let me give you\nthe perfect example in this case. Turn to page 42 of the\nstate's brief for its application of the rule. Here's how\nsharp you have to be. Now, I think if you read the cover\nof the brief, we see that five lawyers, including the\nattorney general of Oregon have -\nQUESTION: No, where - are - are you reading from\nsome - in the brief?\nMR. BALSKE: Yes. I'm sorry. Please look at the\ntop and then look at number IIA and read their language,\nalert the state court to the Federal legal source of the\nclaim by, A, citing to the Sixth Amendment, quote, my\nappellate attorney violated my right to effective\nassistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. I'm\nsorry, you didn't pick that up. It's page 42 -\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. BALSKE: If Mr. Reese followed the formula\nwritten by the attorney general, he would fail their test,\nbecause the right to ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel comes under the Fourteenth Amendment, not the\nSixth Amendment. But the state's attorney generals, who\nare writing the test for you, can't even get it right.\nHow is a poor indigent prisoner going to know how to say\nthe right number? I mean -\nQUESTION: Touche.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BALSKE: I - I think, Justice O'Connor -\nQUESTION: I - I think it's - it's - it's common\nto, you know, you've heard of the incorporation doctrine,\nwhich is that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and\napplies to the states the first ten amendments, or at\nleast portions of the first ten amendments.\nMR. BALSKE: But -\nQUESTION: So it is not inaccurate to say that -\nthat it's a Sixth Amendment right, which has been applied\nto the states via the Fourteenth.\nMR. BALSKE: I thought when we're talking about\nappellate counsel, though, the Sixth Amendment doesn't\ncover it, because the Sixth Amendment doesn't give you the\nright to effective counsel on your appeal, only at trial.\nAnd the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and due\nprocess are what actually cover them. So, if - if you're\nclaiming ineffective assistance of appellate, not trial,\nappellate counsel, it is Fourteenth Amendment, it's not\nSixth Amendment.\nQUESTION: What would happen if the Oregon\nconstitution happened to contain the right in the same\nnumber amendment, like the Sixth was - they were both\nSixth Amendment. Then you have to say Sixth Amendment of\nthe Federal Constitution?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, the - it - the trouble here,\nthe heart -\nQUESTION: Or is this - is this one of the ones\nthat it doesn't contain it in the Oregon constitution\nSixth Amendment so this is one of the ones that, by\nnecessity, must refer to.\nMR. BALSKE: No. This isn't one of those,\nbecause that's at article I, section 11, it doesn't. So\nthis isn't the easy case, this is a -\nQUESTION: But the - the court of appeals -\nMR. BALSKE: - tougher case.\nQUESTION: - thought that the only way in which\nthis claim was properly presented was if they adopted, the\ncourt of appeals adopted the rule, that the state court is\ndeemed to have read and understood the proceedings in the\ntrial court. Am I - am I right about -\nMR. BALSKE: I think they said that and -\nQUESTION: - that formulation of the rule?\nMR. BALSKE: I think they said that, and I don't\nthink you have to go that far to find that Mr. Reese\nfairly presented his claim.\nQUESTION: Well, do you defend that as the test?\nMR. BALSKE: I'm -\nQUESTION: It - it's a - do you defend -\nMR. BALSKE: No.\nQUESTION: - the Ninth Circuit's -\nMR. BALSKE: I don't.\nQUESTION: - articulated test?\nMR. BALSKE: I do not defend the Ninth Circuit's\ntest. I only defend the judgment.\nQUESTION: In your -\nMR. BALSKE: I only say to you he fairly\npresented the claim in this case.\nQUESTION: Right. In - in your opinion, as a\nlawyer who, I take it, is involved in these things -\nMR. BALSKE: Yes.\nQUESTION: - is there really a big problem of\ndifferences among the lower circuits - among the lower\ncourts? To what extent do we have to find a rule? I take\nit the rule now is called fair presentation?\nMR. BALSKE: Correct.\nQUESTION: And there are dozens of ways it could\nbe done. And so the court is just like - supposed to look\nat the individual circumstance, say was it done, was it\nnot done? Here you think it was done because the whole\nthing's two pages, they refer to the Federal Constitution\nin the - in the citation of authorities, and they have no\nparticular, et cetera. All right. Now, is there a\nproblem or isn't there a problem among the circuits in\napplying this fair presentation test?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, if the - the - there are\ndifferences in the circuits, so I can't disagree -\nQUESTION: Is it - are they real differences in\nterms of what counts or -\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I -\nQUESTION: - are they just differences in -\nMR. BALSKE: - I don't think they are in the\nsense of, although I know this Court likely views the\nNinth Circuit as quote, unquote, a liberal circuit of\nsorts, when you read their opinion here, they were being\nvery conservative. They're saying Duncan v. Henry\napplies. Under Duncan you must state it at every level of\nthe proceedings. I mean, they -\nQUESTION: But that - that's a Ninth Circuit\ncase, isn't it, the - Duncan against Henry?\nMR. BALSKE: Yes, it is. It is.\nQUESTION: It's not a case from this Court?\nMR. BALSKE: No, I was talking about -\nQUESTION: But - but the only -\nMR. BALSKE: - they were applying your Duncan\ndecision.\nQUESTION: But the only way in which they could\nsustain their judgment was to adopt this rule of - that\nthe appellate court has the duty, or is presumed to have\nunderstood what happened in the trial court. You seem to\nagree that your case doesn't have to turn on that. The\nNinth Circuit, I thought, said that the case turned on\nthat proposition. Otherwise, it was not going to make it.\nAnd - and I just have to - I can't speak for my\ncolleagues -\nMR. BALSKE: Right.\nQUESTION: - but the - the petition that you read\nme at the appendix, where that just cites the Federal\nconstitutional provision and then says ineffective of\ncounsel - ineffective assistance of counsel - does not\ngive the court any clue as to what it's supposed to do -\nMR. BALSKE: Well -\nQUESTION: - other than to review a record.\nMR. BALSKE: Well - sorry.\nQUESTION: And - and - and I had thought the\nexhaustion requirement was designed to give the court some\nassistance in determining whether or not it showed -\nshould spend more time with the case in order to review\nthe record, in other words, said that counsel had a\nconflict of interest because of marriage or something. It\nwould have been - it would have - it would have been\ntriggered - a - a - a more specific review by the district\ncourt. And it just - by the - by the state appellate\ncourt - and it just didn't have that information.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, what the purpose of the\nexhaustion rule is to give him a fair opportunity to\ndecide it. And when you're talking about petitions for\nreview, it's a little different because it's not your\nbrief on the merits where they're actually deciding -\nQUESTION: But we get thousands of cases around\nhere that just says Fifth Amendment, ineffective\nassistance of counsel. That gives us very, very little\nhelp.\nMR. BALSKE: Well -\nQUESTION: Sixth Amendment.\nMR. BALSKE: - here - here we're talking about\nineffective assistance of counsel. We're talking about it\nwith an Oregon statute that required the Oregon court to\neven tell the appellate courts whether it had been decided\nunder the state or the Federal Constitution. And here\nthey said this was decided under Federal. And then when\nhe uses ineffective, I know that that's less than\nsatisfying, but in Oregon too, if you look in the state's\nbrief, I think, at page 4, footnote 5, what you're going\nto find there is Oregon's - the State of Oregon's position\non what a inmate means when he says ineffectiveness.\nThere it says that in applying article I,\nsection 11 of the Oregon constitution, quote, Oregon\ncourts often refer to inadequate assistance of counsel\ninstead of ineffective assistance of counsel, the term\nusually employed by the state and Federal courts in\napplying the analogous provision of the Federal\nConstitution.\nSo as the Oregon courts are reading the\npleadings, the definition we're looking at, ineffective\nassistance of counsel, the term usually employed by the\nstate and Federal courts. We're giving, factual parts\naside, which aren't with this case at this point, legal\nonly, the Oregon courts were fairly presented with the\nFederal question because -\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me that argument\nthat you're making now that inadequate is the buzzword for\na state claim, ineffective for a Federal claim, is at\nleast in tension with your argument that - that in - with\nrespect to ineffective assistance of counsel, the state -\nthe content of the state standard and - is identical to\nthe Federal. So these labels don't mean anything if the\ncontent is identical, so how -\nMR. BALSKE: Right. Well, I - all I'm, I guess I\ninartfully stated it. I - the position I wanted to\nconvey, and I didn't, is that we started out with a clear\nFederal claim, and when he used ineffective twice more in\nhis appeals, he did nothing at all to dispel anybody of\nthe fact that it was a Federal case. It started out\nFederal and he had allegations under state and Federal\nConstitution. It got decided Federal and then he said\nineffectiveness. He gave no indication that he was\nnarrowing the case at all.\nAnd a good contrast is another Ninth Circuit en\nbanc case, Peterson, because Peterson raised it just like\nMr. Reese initially, under both constitutions. He raised\nit again that way in the appellate court. But when he got\nto his petition for review, he indicated that, to the\nOregon Supreme Court, that he was going on the state\nconstitution, because he only said in his petition for\nreview that this violated article I, section 11 of the\nOregon constitution.\nThat's a contrast, and much - and he, as the\nNinth Circuit held, did not exhaust his state remedies,\nbecause he didn't give the Oregon Supreme Court the fair\nopportunity, because what he did was he took their eyes\nand led them over to the state constitution. And Mr.\nReese didn't do that.\nQUESTION: Well, if you - you say that the Ninth\nCircuit approach to this was wrong, which - which seems to\nbe anchored in, if it's clear that the court of first\ninstance relied on the Federal ground, that stays with the\ncase all the way up. You - you reject that, or you say,\nyou - you are asking us to affirm the judgment, not that\nreasoning. What is your reasoning? What is enough?\nMR. BALSKE: Sure. My reasoning is that it's\nfairly presented when a state inmate clearly articulates\nit under the Federal Constitution, and then continues to\nappeal that judgment without indicating in any way\nwhatsoever that he's relying on anything but the Federal\nConstitution.\nQUESTION: But may I -\nQUESTION: Then I don't see how that differs from\nthe Ninth Circuit -\nQUESTION: That's the Ninth Circuit.\nQUESTION: - because you have to start with the\ncourt of first instance, and you seem to be saying that\nthe court of first instance relies on a Federal ground\nthat stays with the case.\nMR. BALSKE: That - I - that's true. I agree\nwith that portion of it. I guess maybe I -\nQUESTION: I thought you said before that you\nwere not defending the - the Ninth Circuit's approach.\nMR. BALSKE: I -\nQUESTION: Now you tell me you are. I thought\nyou were relying upon the statement in the - in the brief\nto the supreme court that he was relying upon - upon the\nFederal Constitution.\nMR. BALSKE: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And I was going to ask you if you're\nrelying on that now, why didn't you rely on it in your\nbrief in opposition? The question presented by the state\nwas, does a state prisoner alert the state's highest court\nthat he is raising a Federal claim when, in that court, he\nneither cites a specific provision of the Federal\nConstitution nor cites at least one authority that has\ndecided the claim on a Federal basis? Why - why didn't -\nMR. BALSKE: I did -\nQUESTION: - you respond to that -\nMR. BALSKE: I did, but I -\nQUESTION: - by simply saying the question is not\npresented because, in fact, he did cite a specific\nprovision of the Constitution?\nMR. BALSKE: I did, but I didn't -\nQUESTION: I mean, we're wasting our time here if\n- if you want us to decide whether this brief -\nMR. BALSKE: It's -\nQUESTION: - you know, contains the - the Sixth\nAmendment or not. The question we granted cert on is,\ndoes he alert it when he neither - neither cites a\nspecific provision of the Federal Constitution nor cites\nat least one authority? I - I mean -\nMR. BALSKE: I understand.\nQUESTION: What - we're just spinning our wheels\nhere.\nQUESTION: You - you said you did raise that in\nthe EIO?\nMR. BALSKE: But, yeah -\nQUESTION: Where?\nMR. BALSKE: - it's argued in -\nQUESTION: I need to go back to it.\nMR. BALSKE: It's in section III of my brief.\nQUESTION: I've just looked at it. I - I didn't\nsee it.\nMR. BALSKE: Okay.\nQUESTION: I didn't see it presented very\nclearly. It seems to me -\nQUESTION: All right. Anyway, what you're asking\nis - that's why I started at the beginning. I thought the\nquestion was - I thought what the Ninth Circuit did was\ncite a case called Lyons, and in Lyons they say you do\nhave to either cite a particular provision of the Federal\nConstitution or a case that's clearly a Federal case. And\nthen they held that the brief you pointed out to me did\nnot do that. Then they said, but anyway, that brief is\ngood enough because in the lower courts or other courts\nthey had cited the Federal Constitution explicitly.\nNow on that question, I would think they're\nwrong, aren't they? Because, as I started out, you can't\nexpect judges to start going back and filing - looking\nthrough all the briefs they filed in the lower courts, or\nthe opinions below.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I -\nQUESTION: That was, I thought, the question.\nMR. BALSKE: Well -\nQUESTION: And on that question, do you - what do\nyou want to say? I mean, if you're -\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I guess what I want to say is\nthis. I think - if the rule that I'm - I'm not\nnecessarily espousing a rule, I'm trying to say that my\nclient, Mr. Reese, fairly presented. But in saying that\nMr. Reese fairly presented, I don't think that our\napproach is going to place a great burden on the courts by\nany stretch, because all you have to look at is his\npleading in the state court that started it, where he says\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendment. Then you just look at his\nbrief in the court of appeals and his petition for review,\nand the answer is there. And -\nQUESTION: So - so - so now you're - you're -\nwhat you - in order to win your case, you're going to have\nto give us a standard, and your standard is, it seems to\nme, that state appellate courts are bound to look at the\npleadings in the lower courts.\nMR. BALSKE: I guess you're seeing my focus being\nback in the state courts, and I'm looking at Federal\ncourt. I'm looking at when the petitioner files his\npetition and the state steps forward and says failure to\nexhaust. Petitioner's counsel then has the burden of\ncoming forward and saying, take a look at what was in the\nbriefs and what was presented, not what was in the minds\nof the state courts when they looked at them -\nQUESTION: No, but the exhaustion rule -\nMR. BALSKE: - but what did he present?\nQUESTION: - depends upon whether or not the\nstate appellate courts had fair notice of the claim.\nMR. BALSKE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's - that's what we're trying\nto discuss here and -\nQUESTION: That sounds -\nQUESTION: - and it - and - and the - and the\nonly way you can save your case, in the posture that comes\nto us, as I see it, is that that state appellate court is\nbound to look at the pleadings in the - in the court of\nfirst instance.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, what we have here -\nQUESTION: And - and that is a rule. I mean -\nMR. BALSKE: Well - well, here's -\nQUESTION: - you - you - if you're going to save\nyour judgment, we're going to have to do it with a rule.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, and I think with the rule,\nhere's - here's the caveat to the rule, so to speak, and\nit's that comity goes both ways. In other words, we're\nrespecting the state courts have given him the\nopportunity, but we're also going to respect the state's\ncourts own rules and statutes that they use when they're\nlooking at petitions and appeals. And here we're looking\nat Oregon. When you look at Oregon, we turn the page to\nOregon, we have the statute that I read early - earlier,\nthe plain statement, clear statement rule. So -\nQUESTION: But that just goes to the trial\ncourt's judgment, doesn't it?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, that goes to the - the -\nspecifying the basis of the judgment in the trial court -\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. BALSKE: - whether it's a state or a Federal\nissue.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. BALSKE: And in this case, in his written\nopinion, he does that.\nQUESTION: But how does - how does that bear on\nthe appeal process?\nMR. BALSKE: And then in the appeal process, I'm\n- the - the - the reason you have the clear statement rule\nis so the appellate courts will know what the trial court\ndid, not -\nQUESTION: Well, then, you're really - you really\nare supporting the Ninth Circuit's judgment, aren't you -\nopinion? The - the Supreme Court of Oregon should have\nlooked at the trial court's decision, even though it's a\ncourt where the review is discretionary from the court of\nappeals.\nMR. BALSKE: The - the court of appeals most\ncertainly would have seen it and the - the Oregon Supreme\nCourt was on notice by his petition, I mean, the petition\nfor review itself -\nQUESTION: You - you want -\nMR. BALSKE: - is ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\nQUESTION: You want to withdraw your - your\nassurance earlier that you are not defending the - the\nNinth Circuit's basis for reaching its result, but just\nthe result?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I guess, you know, I didn't\nthink that I needed the Ninth Circuit's and I - I must be\nconfused now, because I think I just -\nQUESTION: I - I'm certainly confused. I don't\nknow whether you are.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I think I can -\nQUESTION: Is - is -\nMR. BALSKE: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I don't think you need the Ninth\nCircuit if you're saying the following. Let me tell you\nwhat I think you're saying and you tell me -\nMR. BALSKE: Yeah.\nQUESTION: - whether I'm right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: At the court of appeals level, we\ndon't need the Ninth Circuit rule because the court of\nappeals was reviewing a trial court judgment including\nfindings and statement of law and there it was right in\nthe statement of law referred to, Federal. Number two, we\ndon't need the Ninth Circuit rule when we get to the\nOregon Supreme Court because we've got a petition and the\npetition says Federal, refers specifically to four Federal\namendments, doesn't refer to any state court, any state\nlaw or any state constitution. So you don't need the\nNinth Circuit rule for that purpose. Is that what you're\nsaying?\nMR. BALSKE: That's what I'm saying.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Well, then you have the problem -\nQUESTION: May I ask you -\nQUESTION: - of the Ninth Circuit. Yes?\nQUESTION: Excuse me, may I ask you another\nquestion? Is - is it your view that there's a difference\nbetween the state rule on inadequate assistance of counsel\nand the Federal rule on the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, yes, in this sense of - did\nyou want -\nQUESTION: Well, if there's a difference, would\nyour client not have had the obligation to - to exhaust\nthe state rule as well as the Federal rule? Because that\nwas a remedy for the basic wrong you're complaining of.\nMR. BALSKE: I guess I didn't follow your\nquestion. Could I ask you to repeat it?\nQUESTION: Are inadequate assistance as a matter\nof state law the same as -\nMR. BALSKE: Right.\nQUESTION: - ineffective assistance as a matter\nof Federal law?\nMR. BALSKE: Well, at the trial level, trial\nineffectiveness, they are different clearly. They have a\ntest that's called inadequate for state counsel. They\ncall it ineffective under Strickland -\nQUESTION: It is just a difference in names or a\ndifference in substance?\nMR. BALSKE: It's a difference in substance when\nyou're talking about trial court ineffectiveness. In - in\nour case when we move over -\nQUESTION: I see. You're talking about\nappellate.\nMR. BALSKE: - now we're talking about appellate\nineffectiveness.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. BALSKE: They've got one test that was\ndiscussed during earlier questions, and what they do is\nthey interchangeably use the words ineffective and\ninadequate. They don't use any one term all the time, but\nthere's just one test. That's Oregon law.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: If you -\nQUESTION: Mr. Balske, could you cite me the -\nthe portion of your brief in opposition that you think\nmost clearly presented -\nMR. BALSKE: Yes.\nQUESTION: - the - the issue that -\nMR. BALSKE: Sure.\nQUESTION: - that you are now relying on at the\nSupreme Court level to wit that the Federal Constitution\nwas cited in the brief to the Supreme Court?\nMR. BALSKE: Right.\nQUESTION: Where -\nMR. BALSKE: Well, I think it will be in - I did\nit in three parts, and the third part would have been that\n-\nQUESTION: This is the brief in opposition -\nQUESTION: The brief in opposition -\nQUESTION: - to certiorari.\nQUESTION: - to the petition for cert.\nMR. BALSKE: Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm not even\nthinking.\nQUESTION: Once I've granted -\nQUESTION: It's orange.\nQUESTION: - on - on this question, it's too late\nto tell me the question is irrelevant.\nMR. BALSKE: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I - I like to know it's irrelevant\nbefore I vote to grant cert.\nMR. BALSKE: Right. I - I, you know, I honestly\ndon't remember what I argued at all in that brief. I\nhaven't looked at that in preparing for this and I\napologize, but I -\nQUESTION: If - can you tell - tell me, if I were\nto accept your position about the Ninth Circuit rule, how\ndoes it differ from what I wrote in dissent when I thought\nthat we - you - you shouldn't have to go to the supreme\ncourt of the state, if you - if you remember? If you don't\nremember, that's all right.\nMR. BALSKE: I mean, I know that -\nQUESTION: I mean, what's bothering me about it\nis it sounds like a reasonable position, but it also\nsounds like a position I agreed with in dissent, which\nmeans it isn't the law, the opposite is the law.\nMR. BALSKE: Well, at - I don't disagree that\nO'Sullivan says that it's got to be presented to the\nhighest court of the state. And my position is simply\nthat he did so in this case.\nQUESTION: If there had been an - an objection\npreserved in the Ninth Circuit that whatever else, this\ndoesn't tell us what the facts were, would not that have\nbeen a - a ground for saying you didn't exhaust?\nMR. BALSKE: That would have been a bigger\nproblem for me than this problem, yes, because although he\nsaid, and part of his saying was under the Oregon Balfour\nprocedure when he didn't have a lawyer, he said, my lawyer\nand I disagreed on what issues to raise. One thing that\nMr. Reese didn't say factually was what those issues were,\nand that would be my problem if their position were that\nfactually it wasn't clear enough.\nQUESTION: So - so they - they have abandoned an\nobjection one - one would think would be the logical first\none, he doesn't have any facts, out the door.\nMR. BALSKE: Yes, I - that's true. They did\nabandon it.\nQUESTION: Do we have to ignore that too?\nMR. BALSKE: I think you should, and I've argued\nin my brief that you should because they dropped it from\nthe case and abandoned it, and because the only issue\npresented is the issue of whether or not he fairly\npresented it. So I would espouse that, whether you have\nto or not, obviously your decision.\nQUESTION: But if this - if this Court is going\nto give any guidance, certainly that should be the - the\nfirst one, shouldn't it?\nMR. BALSKE: Well sure. The first piece -\nQUESTION: So, what your case is about -\nMR. BALSKE: - and - and I think that is fair\npresentation law. You have to supply sufficient facts and\nthe law upon which you rely. Here they didn't object to\nthe insufficiency of facts, but the rule wouldn't be any\ndifferent than it was before under Picard.\nIf there are no more questions, thank you very\nmuch.\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE: Thank you, Mr. Balske.\nGeneral Myers, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. HARDY MYERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, so two quick comments or\npoints. First, this case illustrates the fallacy of any\nkind of doctrine which says that a appellate court can\ntell what issues have been chosen to be asserted to it,\nput before it, by going back and looking at the decision\nof a - of a lower court. Here, the trial court in Oregon\ndisposed of one of the Federal inappellate assistance of\ncounsel claims, citing Jones against Barnes, but it had\nbefore it state law claims of inappellate - ineffective\nassistance of counsel, as well as Federal. The trial\ncourt didn't mention the state claims, but they were all\ndismissed as well by the judgment that was ultimately\nentered at the trial court level.\nSo both state and Federal claims were dismissed.\nYou couldn't tell by looking at the trial court judgment\nwhat the - what the prisoner was choosing to actually\nassert among those dismissed claims at the court of\nappeals level. He could as well have been asserting his\ndismissed state ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nQUESTION: General Myers, do you have any\nresponse to the - to the new point raised - it was new to\nme anyway - that - that this in fact, the Federal claim\nwas raised in the petition?\nMR. MYERS: No. Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What - what is that? I'd really like\nto know that.\nMR. MYERS: It - at page 47-48 of the joint\nappendix, which you may have already been referring to -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MYERS: - the petition for review is set\nforth. And if you go to the argument portion, Your Honor,\nwhich is at the very - second paragraph of the argument\nportion, I think that's going to be on page 48.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MYERS: You'll see the last - second sentence\nof the second paragraph: Moreover, since petitioner\nasserts he was coerced and threatened by counsel to waive\nhis right to trial by jury, petitioner believes his Fifth,\nSixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights have been -\nQUESTION: I see, I see.\nMR. MYERS: - have been violated. So - so the\nineffective assistance of trial counsel claim was\nspecifically Federalized, if you will, and that's the -\nthat's the only place where those Federal citations\nappear.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. MYERS: Your Honors, again, the - the state\nof the law in this area, we think, can fairly be described\nas still disturbed, a term I used earlier, and we very\nsincerely hope that this Court will use this case both in\nrelation to the Ninth Circuit decision to reaffirm that it\nis the state petitioner, not the state courts, who have\nthe responsibility to assert - fairly present the claim,\nand secondly, to go for further - and further clarify\nspecifically what state prisoners must do in order to\nclearly indicate the Federal source of their claim -\nQUESTION: If you prevail, I hope you're not\nunhappy with what you get, because you're going to have\npetitions in which there's a huge laundry list of cases.\nWe have to then qualify that by saying there has to be a\nfair and concise statement of the legal and the factual\nbasis for the claim.\nMR. MYERS: Your Honor, indeed, the fact that\nFederal - or that the Federal source of the claim is used\nis not the end of the fair presentation issue, because\nthere's still going to be the ongoing requirement of\nadequately identifying your substance of your claim, to\nuse the terminology of this Court, the - the legal theory\nas well as the adequacy of the fact.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\n"
