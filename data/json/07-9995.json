        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 07-9995, Rivera v. Illinois.\nMr. Leven.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. LEVEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LEVEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Petitioner lawfully exercised a\nperemptory challenge on juror Delores Gomez. As a\nresult of the erroneous denial of that challenge, Ms.\nGomez wrongfully sat on the jury and lacked authority to\nrender a judgment. Petitioner's conviction should be\nreversed automatically for three separate and\nindependent reasons.\nFirst, the trial before an unlawful\nadjudicator is structural error. Two, the wrongful\nseating of a juror is structural error, because the\neffect of the error is impossible to determine --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you putting -- are\nyou equating this with a biased judge? The -- the\ncategory of structural error has been kept very narrow\nby this Court. And it seems to me that a juror who is\nperfectly qualified, who it is conceded -- it is\nconceded could not have been dismissed for cause, is\nquite a different matter than a judge who -- who has\ntaken a bribe or who has a monetary stake in the case.\nIt -- it seems quite a stretch to apply\nthose decisions to -- to the case of a juror who was\nqualified, and it was just a judge who was overexuberant\nin denying a peremptory challenge.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, our unlawful-adjudicator\nclaim is not dependent on a finding or showing of bias.\nA -- a juror who is illegally on the jury, who does not\nhave the authority to serve, would render the jury\nimproperly constituted. Therefore, there would be\nstructural error for a jury illegally constituted to\nrender a judgment irrespective of bias.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But your whole\nargument that the -- that the juror was illegally\nsitting and the jury was illegally constituted is a --\nin effect a statement of the effect of State law. And\nthe State supreme court doesn't think that's the effect\nunder State law.\nSo it seems to me that the -- the full\npremise of your argument that there is something\ninherently unlawful about the seating of that juror is\nsimply in -- in effect denied by the State supreme\ncourt. And we take our law from them.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, Your Honor, there are\nState law and Federal law components to this issue.\nPetitioner had a lawful right to excuse juror Gomez\nunder Illinois Supreme Court Rule 434.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But no -- no\nconstitutional right, no constitutional right to the\nperemptory challenge.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, there is a constitutional\nright to due process involved that is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you in effect\nare saying that any violation of State law with respect,\nlet's say, to criminal trial procedure becomes, if not\nremedied, a due process violation under Federal law.\nThat's -- that's your -- your unstated premise, isn't\nit?\nMR. LEVEN: No, Your Honor. The -- our\nargument is very narrow in scope: That if a -- a jury\nthat is illegally constituted renders a verdict of\nguilty, then that jury is an unlawful adjudicator. The\nunlawful adjudicator claim is what triggers the right to\ndue process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There could be a thousand\nreasons why under State law a particular jury is\nimproperly constituted. So you are saying whenever the\nState under whatever State laws it has says that the\njudge made a mistake about who to put on the jury, that\nthat violates the Federal Constitution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just as an example, to\nfollow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can\nyou answer his question -- many States have -- have\nrules that you have to be a resident of the county to\nserve on that jury. And suppose a juror thinks that he\nor she is a resident and gets the county line wrong or\ndoesn't know what the residency requirement. Under your\nrule -- what is your term, an \"unlawful adjudicator.\"\nAnd then we have a -- we have a -- a Federal\nconstitutional standard that requires structural error\nfor any State -- for any violation of any State -- State\nrule. That is Justice Breyer's question.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, with respect to jury\nqualifications such as age and citizenship, there is a\nvery delicate screening process that goes into effect.\nSo the problem of an unlawful-adjudicator with respect\nto, say, age would be a very, very rare phenomenon and\nwould rarely occur, because jurors who are too young to\nserve, perhaps under 18 years old, would never make\ntheir way to a jury pool in the first place. So it\nwould really be unfair to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are -- you are\navoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there\nare not going to be many violations of this sort, and\nthen you pick out age. But Justice Breyer began -- the\npreface to his question was -- was that there are -- are\nmanifold requirements varying from State to State.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What you are giving us is\na sweeping proposition, A, for the constitutional\nprinciples that you are setting forth; B, for the\nsupervision and intrusion it would cause Federal courts\non the State system.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, if we take the juror's\nqualifications that were discussed in the State's brief,\nit would appear that all the qualifications that are\ndiscussed there would -- as I said, it would be a very\nrare situation, indeed, for a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? One\nqualification is that a jury -- a juror can't be\nprejudiced. All right. I think it's a very common\nthing for prosecutors and defense lawyers to get into\narguments about whether a particular juror is or is not\nprejudiced. Okay.\nSo sometimes the judge excuses them, maybe\nfive million times a year; and probably in a certain\npercentage, maybe 5,000 or 500 or 50,000, the judge is\nwrong. All right.\nSo the State appellate court says he's\nwrong. So the jury wasn't made up properly.\nNow you are saying in every one of those\ncases that violates the Federal Constitution. I have\nnever heard of this before. It may be there is some\nprecedent for it. I don't know. That's why I am\nasking.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, Gomez versus United States\nset forth the principle equating a right to an\nadjudicator with lawful authority to decide at every\ncritical stage of the proceeding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that means that held --\nwe have held in that case -- I had better look at it --\nthat in any instance where excusing a juror violates\nState law that that is a violation of the Federal\nConstitution. Which is the case that says that?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, that -- that case did not\ninvolve jurors, Your Honor, but it did involve a\nmagistrate who lacked the authority to preside over voir\ndire. And the court held under a general principle of\nlaw equating the right of -- the lawful-authority right\nto the right to an impartial jury and used the phrase \"a\nbasic fair trial right,\" meaning that the right to a\nlawful adjudicator is a basic fair trial right. And\nalso --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are not --\nsuggesting, because you conceded there was no basis for\na for-cause challenge, you are not -- you are not saying\nthat Gomez was unqualified or that she was biased. If\nshe was biased, you had a basis for that, she could be\nexcused for cause.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, there is a reasonable\npossibility of bias with respect to Gomez because of her\nextensive contacts with gunshot victims at Cook County\nHospital --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But she was an\nadministrator. She wasn't a nurse. She didn't deal\nwith people who had gunshot wounds.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the Illinois Supreme Court\nheld that defense counsel's strike of Gomez was a valid\nreason to have her removed from the jury. She could\nhave, even though she said -- even though she was not\nchallengeable for cause, the peremptory challenge is\nthere for a purpose, and that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't need a good\nreason for a peremptory challenge.\nMR. LEVEN: The peremptory -- if I\nunderstand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole fun of a\nperemptory challenge: You don't need a good reason.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the purpose of the\nperemptory challenge is to help to create a fair and\nimpartial jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And for some\nreason, I just think this person is not going to vote\nfor me. I don't know why. I just don't think so. I\ndon't want this person sitting on the jury. That's all\nthe reason you need.\nMR. LEVEN: That's right. Under Swain v.\nAlabama, a peremptory challenge can be exercised without\nhaving to state a reason.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, our footnote in a\nlater case authored by Justice Scalia indicates\nconsiderable doubt as to the viability and to the\ncorrectness of that formulation in Swain.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, with --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Salazar, I think, is\nthe --\nMR. LEVEN: Yes, Martinez-Salazar in its\nfootnote 4 determined that the automatic reversal rule\nin Swain was subject to reconsideration due to the\nadvent of harmless error analysis.\nBut I was citing Swain for a different\npurpose. I was citing Swain for the purpose that a\nperemptory challenge can be exercised without having to\nstate a reason, and that's a fundamental --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. I thought you\nwere citing Swain -- and I think you are going to have\nto establish -- that peremptory -- to win your case,\nthat there is a constitutional basis, a constitutional\nright to exercise a peremptory challenge, at least --\nthen you can you have a subset of that -- when the State\ngives it to you. But I think Swain no longer stands for\nthat proposition.\nMR. LEVEN: I wasn't citing it for that\nproposition, Your Honor. We have the case of Evitts v.\nLucey, for example, where the Court was analyzing the\nright to an appeal. And the Court found that the right\nto an appeal was not of constitutional origin, but once\nthe State had created a right to an appeal it had the\nobligation to administer that right consistently with\nfundamental fairness and due process.\nSo here we have a peremptory right that the\nState of Illinois wasn't obligated to create. But once\nit adopted that peremptory right, it was, in effect,\nadopting the long venerable tradition of peremptory\nchallenges that has existed in this country since the\nfounding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- well, first,\nhow many peremptories does Illinois law allow?\nMR. LEVEN: For non-capital cases, it's\nseven, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose a State\nallowed only three peremptory challenges. There would\nbe nothing in the least unconstitutional about that,\nright?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, under Ross v. Oklahoma,\nthe State had the authority to regulate peremptory\nchallenges.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This was number four, was\nit?\nMR. LEVEN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The challenge to Gomez\nwas the number four peremptory?\nMR. LEVEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, if the State had\nonly three which it could do, there would be no basis\nfor removing Gomez from the array. That is, the defense\nwould have already exercised three peremptory\nchallenges, she's number four, too bad. That would be\nthe end of it, right? She would sit on the jury.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, as to our unlawful\nadjudicator claim that would be correct, because if the\ndefense did not have a peremptory challenge to exercise\nin order to strike Gomez if the peremptories have run\nout --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is something\nunseemly about saying because the State is generous in\nits peremptories, you have a grand constitutional\nargument to make, even though there is no constitutional\nright to any peremptory challenge?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the State is obligated,\nconsistent with due process, to provide that which is\npromised. And the problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That goes back to the point\nwhich you rejected when I suggested -- I suggested\nearlier that you were in effect arguing that every\nviolation of a State statute in this criminal context\namounted to a due process violation. And you say, no,\nthat's not what I am arguing. It seems to me that that\nis exactly what you just said to Justice Ginsburg.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, what makes the peremptory\nchallenge unique is its venerable tradition since the\ntime --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we were talking about\nperemptory challenges before and we are talking about\nperemptory challenges now. Have you changed your\nposition from -- from the position you stated in answer\nto my question?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, if I understand correctly,\nYour Honor, the case involves peremptory challenges.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Look, the question that I\nthought I was asking and I thought you were answering\nwas this: Do you claim that every violation of State\nlaw in the -- we'll say in the selection of jurors -- is\nautomatically, if not remedied by the State, a Federal\ndue process violation? And you said, if I recall\ncorrectly, no.\nIt seemed to me that in answering\nJustice Ginsburg's question just now you were saying\nyes. You said the State has to act consistently with\ndue process.\nMR. LEVEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so, do you stand by\nthe answer you gave me or is it, in fact, now your\nposition that every violation of state law that goes\nunremedied becomes a federal due process violation?\nMR. LEVEN: No, I'm not saying that every\nviolation of State law that's unremedied --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then why does\nthis one become a due process violation if it's\nunremedied.\nMR. LEVEN: Because this one involves a\nState violation that resulted in an unlawful\nadjudicator. Let's take --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- that then\ngoes back to an earlier question. It's an unlawful\nadjudicator if state law says so. Federal law says you\ndon't even have to have peremptory challenges, you don't\neven have to have a process for winnowing out the Gomez\njurors.\nSo, in effect, if you are saying that there\nis something unlawful about the seating of the juror,\nyou are making a statement of State law, and the State\nSupreme Court disagrees with you, which seems to me to\nforeclose your argument.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the State disagreed with\nour position as to the Federal automatic reversal law.\nThe court applied, and we would argue misapplied --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the court -- the\nSupreme Court of Illinois did not find anything unlawful\nabout the juror sitting. They said, yeah, the perempt\nshould have -- the peremptory challenge should have been\nrespected. But they did not say, and it seems to me\nthey clearly rejected the notion, that there was\nsomething unlawful about the jury and unlawful about\nthat juror's participating in reaching a verdict; isn't\nthat correct?\nMR. LEVEN: I would read the Illinois\nSupreme Court opinion -- specifically what they did\nstate is that the trial court was incorrect in denying\nthe peremptory challenge, therefore that juror should\nnot have sat on the jury, that juror was wrongfully on\nthe jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no. The -- the\nperemptory challenge should have been respected. But\nthe Illinois Supreme Court did not say, as I understand\nit, that by allowing the juror to sit the juror was\nacting in an unlawful capacity, or that there was\nsomething unlawful under State law about the jury's\nactions and the jury's verdict.\nAm I not correct about that?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the Illinois Supreme Court\nonly made one statement, that the peremptory was\nwrongfully denied. Now, as far as elaborating on its\nreasoning --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if they thought that\ntainted everything that happened afterwards, it seems to\nme they would have said, therefore, the verdict is no\ngood.\nMR. LEVEN: No, because the court misapplied\nthis Court's precedent in Neder. That's the basis for\nthe court affirming the conviction. It had nothing to\ndo with the issue of whether or not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it had everything\nto do, it seems to me, with the issue of State law.\nRegardless of whether they applied or misapplied a\nprecedent of ours respect -- with respect to Federal\nconstitutional law, it seems to me that the Illinois\nSupreme Court has to have meant it was okay so far as\nthe validity of the verdict was concerned for this\nperson to participate.\nMR. LEVEN: The Illinois Supreme Court found\nthat the verdict was valid because they thought that the\nerror was subject to harmless error review in relying on\nNeder and Martinez-Salazar\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So ultimately, there was --\nthere was no error under State law that needed to be\ncorrected?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, there is an error in terms\nof the adjudicator, Ms. Gomez, being seated on the jury\nand under Rule 434 Petitioner had the right to a juror\nthat then was not subject to a peremptory challenge.\nGomez was -- seated on that jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But so far as the ultimate\njury verdict was concerned, the Illinois Supreme Court,\nI understand it to have said, was there is no error that\nneeds to be corrected under State law.\nMR. LEVEN: I don't read the opinion that\nway. I read --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't they\ncorrect it?\nMR. LEVEN: Because they thought that the\nerror was subject to harmless error review under Federal\nlaw. And we would argue the two positions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You read -- in other words,\nyou read the -- the -- the Illinois Supreme Court as to\nsay, this is a violation of our statutes and\nconstitution, a violation that would -- would entitle\nthis person to have the -- the verdict set aside and a\nnew trial, but because the Federal practice, applying\nFederal constitutional law, is to engage in harmless\nerror analysis, we won't correct our State law error as\na matter of State law, and -- and we will in fact apply\na harmless error analysis that otherwise wouldn't apply\nbecause it's Federal, and on that ground we will let the\nverdict stand. Is that the way you read the Illinois\nSupreme Court?\nMR. LEVEN: No. The court declined to\ndetermine whether a constitutional right had been\nviolated, but the court applied this Court's precedent\nunder Martinez-Salazar and Neder, the Federal harmless\nerror automatically reversal law that this Court has,\nand used that to find that the error was subject to\nharmless error review. The court did not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but how -- how\ncould it do that if there were not some underlying\nFederal constitutional right? I say \"how could it do\nthat.\" It obvious that they did it; but what -- what\nwould be the principle basis for that analysis? What\nwould be the analytic framework that would lead it to\nlook to the Federal decisions? This is a State issue.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the court did not specify\nwhy it did so, but it did rely on Neder and\nMartinez-Salazar. And therefore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are asking you what\nthe analytic justification for that course of reasoning\nis if that is indeed its course of reasoning.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, it's hard for me to\nspeculate on the thinking of the Illinois Supreme Court.\nBut --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you have to give\nus a sustainable analytic framework if -- if we are\ngoing to reverse their decision.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, we argued at the Illinois\nSupreme Court level that due process was violated; but\nthe Illinois Supreme Court declined to consider whether\na constitutional right had been violated, moved\naccordingly to the question of whether or not automatic\nreversal would apply or whether the error would be\nsubject to harmless error review.\nBut the Illinois Supreme Court did not say\nanything about whether a constitutional right had been\nviolated except it declined to consider that issue, even\nthough it was argued at that level by Petitioner.\nNot only do we have a constitutional basis\nfor this Court to have access to its automatic reversal\nlaw; the fact that the court did rely on -- the Illinois\nSupreme Court relied on Neder and Martinez-Salazar gives\nthis Court authority to reach the issue of whether or\nnot to apply automatic reversal law under -- under its\nauthority to correct --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the Illinois\nSupreme Court was assuming a Federal violation when it\ndecided what the reversal rule would be. But your\nFederal violation determines -- is bottomed on the\nnotion that there was an unlawful adjudicator on the\njury. Would that reasoning apply, in regard to one of\nthe earlier questions, if you have a Cook County jury\nand they had a juror from Dupage County and the law says\nno, you have got to have a local juror, and it turns out\nthat they had wrongly seated such a juror? Would that\nbe an unlawful adjudicator?\nMR. LEVEN: Yes, it would appear so if it --\nif a State law stated that, a juror qualification\nrequirement that the juror who presides in Cook County\nmust be a resident of the county.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just have one more\nthought. And if it is such an unlawful adjudicator, it\nwould definitely be Federal constitutional error?\nMR. LEVEN: Yes, because it would implicate\nthe due process clause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But would it have to\nbe -- would it have to be structural error? I -- I\ndon't know why you don't argue that it's structural\nerror when the error is a wrongful denial of a\nperemptory challenge, because it is impossible for you\nto establish the harmfulness of error because, as\nJustice Scalia pointed out, a peremptory challenge is\njust a hunch on your part; you don't need any more. But\nif it's something like he was in Dupage County rather\nthan Cook County, maybe that's something where it's fair\nto put the burden of showing harmfulness on the\ndefendant.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nState under Chapman would be required to prove\nharmlessness, and I think it would be impossible to\ndetermine whether this -- this error would be harmful --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe that's\ntrue. My point is that may be true with respect to a\nperemptory challenge, but it doesn't seem to me to be\nterribly difficult to say, well, he lives in Dupage\nCounty and not Cook County, so what's the big deal?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, under harmless error\nreview, the appellate court envisions the actual jury\nthat rendered the verdict, whether or not the error\nwould have rendered the verdict different had it been --\nhad it not occurred. And in this instance, we have a --\nwe can't analyze it from the perspective of whether this\njury would have rendered the same verdict absent the\nerror, because this jury that rendered the verdict is\nillegally composed, is illegitimate.\nSo what the Illinois Supreme Court did in\nanalyzing harmless error review is it substituted its\njudgment for -- for the reviewing court, it substituted\nits judgment for the -- for the jury. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we had an actual\njury. It's not as though you had no jury verdict and\nthen the court would say -- the court would say, we\nthink that this defendant was as guilty as they come;\nbut you had a jury with jurors who met all the State law\nqualifications, already made the determination of guilt.\nSo that's a little different from the case where, say, a\njudge would attempt the equivalent of a directed\nverdict.\nMR. LEVEN: Well, in this case I don't think\nwe can look at it from the perspective that the Court\nnormally looks at it from when it reviews -- adopts\nharmless error review. In the normal situation the\nCourt looks at whether or not the error contributed to\nthe verdict and whether or not the actual jury that\nrendered the verdict would have rendered the same\nverdict absent the error.\nBut we don't have -- we can't do it from the\nperspective of the actual jury in this case, because the\nactual jury here is illegal.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the\nConstitution prohibits the State from going further than\nBatson to protect against the use of peremptory\nchallenges for discriminatory purposes? Specifically,\nis there any reason why a State could not provide that\nwhenever -- that a trial judge always has the authority,\nwhen the judge has any suspicion of discrimination, to\nask for an explanation from counsel as to the reason,\nwithout having to establish -- without there having to\nbe a prima facie case?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, that's our position, Your\nHonor, because what the trial judge did in this case is\nasked for a reason without having established any prima\nfacie case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, well, that's what\nBatson says has to be done to in order justify the\nstrike. When -- but is there any reason why a State\ncouldn't go further to guard against discrimination in\nthe use of peremptories?\nMR. LEVEN: I apologize, Your Honor; I'm not\nsure I understand about going further than. Under\nBatson there is a three-step process, and the State must\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination before\nthe judge is entitled to ask for any kind of\nexplanation; and here there wasn't any kind of gender\ndiscrimination of any kind, according to the Illinois\nSupreme Court. Therefore, the -- the judge in this case\nwas not authorized to even ask for an explanation. But\nthe explanation given by defense counsel is pretty good.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Justice Alito's\nquestion is could the State say as a matter of State law\nwhenever the trial judge has a hunch that there might\nhave been discriminatory purpose involved, may he refuse\nto allow the preemptory challenge?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, we argued that the judge\ndoesn't have sua sponte authority to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I -- if the State\nexplicitly gave the trial judge that authority, would\nthat be constitutional?\nMR. LEVEN: Well, the -- the State has the\nauthority to have some regulation of preemptory\nchallenge rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The authority to challenge\npreemptory challenge rights entirely? Right?\nMR. LEVEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this is not a hard\nquestion.\nMR. LEVEN: Yes, the State can abolish\nperemptory challenges if it wishes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, it could\ntake the much lesser step of allowing the trial judge,\nif he has any suspicion that a peremptory-challenge\nright is being used in violation of Batson, to disallow\nit. What is wrong with that.\nMR. LEVEN: In this case, though, we do have\nperemptory challenges created by the State. And, Your\nHonor, I request that I -- to reserve the remainder of\nmy time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Scodro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCODRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is no due-process violation here, and\nthat takes care of this case at the threshold.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, does it really?\nSuppose I agree with you that there is -- there is no\nFederal constitutional violation. But I also think that\nin assessing the consequence of a State-law violation\nthe Illinois court here was looking to Federal law and\nwas trying to apply the Federal law of harmless error.\nIf that's the situation, would we not have\nthe obligation to determine, or wouldn't we have the\nobligation to determine, whether it was properly\napplying the Federal law of harmless error? Even though\nit didn't have to, it chose to use the Federal law of\nharmless error to -- to apply to this State violation.\nMR. SCODRO: Justice Scalia, the briefs\nbefore the Illinois Supreme Court raise two independent\ngrounds for automatic reversal by the petitioner. One\nwas a pure State law for automatic reversal. The other\nwas a due-process violation that would then trigger a\nFederal automatic reversal.\nWhat the Illinois Supreme Court did\nexplicitly is to say, even if there were a due-process\nviolation here, we believe as a matter of Federal law\nthat would not trigger automatic reversal.\nWhat certainly applied -- because of some of\nthe Federal questions that they have suggested, what is\nimplied is that if the Court had believed that as a\nmatter of Illinois law there were an automatic-reversal\nrule required, that this was an unlawful juror to the\nextended so profound that it voided the judgment and\nrequired a new trial, under those circumstances the\ncourt would never have had to reach that assumption,\nmuch less go into any of the analysis it did.\nSo here the court was faced with both\nclaims, rejected both, but to reach the Federal claim\nthey must first show a due-process violation. And\nthat's what they failed to do here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to\nJustice Scalia's question is what?\nMR. SCODRO: The answer, Your Honor, is that\nif the court had said, we are going to lockstep our\nFederal -- or, rather, our State harmless-error analysis\nwith the Federal question, Federal analysis, and\nwhatever they say goes, then I would agree under those\ncircumstances this Court could review that and say, you\ngot that wrong.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case would\nyou cite for that proposition? And you can't say\nMichigan versus Long.\nMR. SCODRO: I can't say Michigan versus\nLong. That is an excellent question, Your Honor. I\nmean I think that -- let me -- let me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why did they get it\nwrong?\nMR. SCODRO: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say they got it\nwrong?\nMR. SCODRO: Oh, I don't think they did. I\nwould --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that mean even if it\nwere Federal? I don't know. I'm asking. Again, I\ndon't know.\nMR. SCODRO: We think they analyzed it\nabsolutely correctly, as a matter of fact.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't this Johnson versus\nStandard Oil and that sort of thing?\nMR. SCODRO: Well, I think -- I should say\nif the court -- if the -- if the Illinois court wanted\nto back away from Federal law at this point, they could\nabsolutely do so. And so even if this Court were to\nsay, you got it wrong federally, they could, of course,\nat that point say, no, we -- as a matter of State law,\nwe are going to apply a Brack standard or a Chapman\nstandard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that clear as a matter\n-- I don't know. Again, I'm asking. Is it clear as a\nmatter of Federal law that we have lots of Federal\ntrials, and in a Federal trial where a district judge\nmakes an error in excusing a juror -- he shouldn't have\nexcused the juror, there are many, many reasons for\ndoing it, so the jury is not properly as the defense\nlawyer has the right to have it -- that that requires\nautomatically a new trial? Is that clear as a matter of\nFederal law or not? And I --\nMR. SCODRO: That is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know the answer.\nMR. SCODRO: It is not clear, Your Honor.\nIn response to an earlier question they cited Gomez.\nAnd they -- and there is a line of cases including Gomez\nthat are cited in their brief. Those are Federal\nsupervisory authority cases in which the Court said not\nas a matter of due process interpreting the Federal\nstatute -- in that case the Magistrate's act -- to\nconclude that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am not talking about\nMagistrates, and I'm not talking about due process. I\nam asking the question, just what I asked. Now, you\nheard what I asked. It's about jurors.\nMR. SCODRO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right? What is the\nanswer?\nMR. SCODRO: It is not -- that is not a due-\nprocess violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. I'm not asking\nthat question. I am asking when a lawyer -- when a --\nwhen a judge makes a mistake and excuses a juror whom he\nshouldn't have excused because he thought the juror was\nprejudiced, let's say, and he wasn't. The appeals court\nsays, you are wrong about excusing him. Does under\nFederal law the defendant become entitled to a new\ntrial? Not under the Constitution, under whatever you\nwant.\nMR. SCODRO: I don't believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?\nMR. SCODRO: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think the answer is no,\nokay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Going back to\nJustice Scalia's question, do you think we would have\njurisdiction of this certiorari condition if we were\nconvinced there was no Federal or constitutional error;\nthey were merely trying to decide whether the State\ncourt applied the correct constitutional standard in\ncorrecting what it thought was a correct federal\nconstitutional error?\nMR. SCODRO: I don't, Your Honor. I think\nthe Federal question, if there is one presented, is\nwhether or not there is a Federal due-process violation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if there is none\nthere, we don't have jurisdiction to answer and give an\nadvisory opinion on how the Illinois Supreme Court\nshould run its shop.\nMR. SCODRO: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the Illinois Supreme\nCourt can happily go along blaming everything on us, so\nwhen it stands for reelection, it can say, well, we are\njust applying Federal law.\nMR. SCODRO: Your Honor, I think in this\ncase what the Illinois Supreme Court did is they\nconcluded --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but that's the\nconsequence of your answer to that question. It seems\nto me there is much to be said for the disposition that\nwhere a State court even in resolving a State-law\nquestion uses a Federal principle, adverts specifically\nto Federal law and cites Federal cases, it would cover\nyou.\nMR. SCODRO: Your Honor, let me be clear.\nWhat they did here is they had assumed the Federal\nconstitutional violation because they recognized that\nthere was no State entitlement to a new trial under\nthese circumstances. So they then said, well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You -- they did make that\nassumption, but you think the assumption is wrong. And\nif we think the assumption is wrong, you would agree\nwith Justice Scalia that we can go ahead and say, well,\nyou are running for reelection, so we are going to\ncorrect your errors on Federal law.\nMR. SCODRO: I would say, Your Honor, I\nthink that if the Court were to conclude there is no\ndue-process violation, it would be an artificial\nexercise to then embark on an analysis of a -- harmless\nerrors.\nThis Court has said time and again that\nthere is a close link between the alleged due-process or\nSixth Amendment violation and the manner in which the\ndue process -- the harmless-error analysis is conducted.\nIn Gonzales/Lopez that was the gist of much\nof the debate between the majority of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would certainly agree\nthat if the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court used\nthe Federal harmless-error rule was because it was\nassuming a Federal constitutional violation, once we\nreject that assumption, the whole thing drops out. But\nis that entirely clear from the opinion?\nMR. SCODRO: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clear that the\nIllinois Supreme Court wouldn't have used the same test\nunder simply Illinois law?\nMR. SCODRO: Well, two points, Your Honor.\nFirst, in context with the briefs which independently\nsought both State and Federal remand and page 171 of the\njoint appendix where the court makes clear that we are\nsimply not going to resolve the question of whether\nthere is a Federal due-process violation, I think in\ncontext it does become clear what the court has done\nhere is it certainly concluded there is not a State\nright.\nSo it proceeded to say, well, what if there\nis a Federal due-process entitlement? If that is the\ncase, let's proceed and decide, well, it's harmless\nanyway. We don't need to then reverse this conviction.\nNow, I will say that if the Court harbors\nconcerns -- if the Court were to conclude there is no\ndue-process violation here, but harbors concerns that\nthe Illinois Supreme Court feels itself duty bound to\nfollow this Court's jurisprudence on the question of\nharmlessness, then at that point the Court could simply\nmake a due-process ruling and remand to allow the\nIllinois Supreme Court to make clear what I think is\nalready clear -- but to make crystal clear that they\nwould apply a -- a harmless-error standard to this sort\n-- this sort of declaration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is the -- the\nonly reason the Illinois Supreme Court found: That\nthere was no error of constitutional dimension, meaning\nFederal constitutional dimension. The only reason it --\nit found that is because it found that the error was\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nMR. SCODRO: Your Honor, I think that what\nthey have done is they just put the statement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is the cart before the\nhorse.\nMR. SCODRO: They have run the analysis, and\nwhat they have done, Your Honor, is said, look, any\nerror here of constitutional dimension would be\nharmless. Therefore, we inform the reader on page 171\nwe simply haven't reached the question. Please don't\nread the foregoing analysis to suggest that we have made\na prior conclusion that there is indeed a due-process\nviolation here.\nIndeed, the court suggests there probably\nisn't by early arguments that you are pointing out that\nthis Court has long held since -- since Hilt in 1919 has\nlong held that there is no due-process entitlement to a\nperemptory challenge. So I think in context it is quite\nclear that what the Court has done is to say, there is\nnothing in here for you under Illinois law. Under\nFederal law, even if there were a due-process violation,\nit is simply not -- it is simply harmless error.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- then you would\nhave no objection to a remand that says, Illinois\nSupreme Court, you can't blame it on Federal law. It's\nup to you as a matter of State law. And now answer the\nquestion that you didn't answer; that is, what is the\nconsequence under State law of an erroneous denial of a\nperemptory? You would have no objection to such a\nremand?\nMR. SCODRO: Your Honor, we would have no\nobjection to that procedure, but I would caution that it\nseems unnecessary in light of the fact that the parties\nso sought relief under both State and Federal law and\nthe fact that the supreme court -- the Illinois Supreme\nCourt concludes it doesn't need to reach -- the way it\nanalyzes the -- the constitutional question.\nI think that -- and this underlying\nassumption that judges understand, I think it's fair to\nassume that the Illinois justices understood they could\ngo further as a matter of State law than Federal, but\nnot -- they couldn't provide fewer protections.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: For the reasons that have\nbeen discussed, it may be that we won't get to the\nmerits of the Petitioner's argument, but assuming we do,\nthe Petitioner talks about the -- I don't have -- the\n\"unlawfully constituted jury.\" Is -- is -- what is the\nextinction distinction between the hypothetical case of\nthe juror who isn't a resident of the county and the\nState says you have to be a resident of the county --\nwhat is the distinction between that and, say, a\nnon-Article III judge sitting on a court of appeals\npanel? Why is one structural and the other not?\nMR. SCODRO: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this would -- this\nwould be a little different than the juror who might be\nbiased or might not be biased, because this goes to a\nhard qualification. It's just a hypothetical in the\ncase, but it's a -- it's a linchpin to the Petitioner's\nargument.\nMR. SCODRO: I should begin by saying that\nthe Gomez and Wingo and Nguyen decisions and others they\ncite in that line for the non-Article III judge\nproposition are themselves not due process decisions,\nbut are conclusions as a matter of State -- of Federal\nlaw, rather, the idea being that Congress simply hadn't\ndelegated the authority properly in those cases. They\nare not due process cases.\nBut if one were to assume that those would\nalso be due process violations, to have a non-Article II\njudge sit, I would distinguish those cases at that point\nhypothetically by saying there is a profound, profound\ndifference between someone who lacks any and all mantle\nof state authority, on the one hand, and a juror who is\nproperly sworn and who satisfies all the statutory\nrequirements for sitting as a matter of Illinois law.\nAnd I should note, in the reply brief\nthere's a point at which they contend --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but the\nhypothetical is it doesn't -- the juror doesn't satisfy\nthe requirement because he or she is from the wrong\ncounty.\nMR. SCODRO: Again, Your Honor, the\nfundamental -- the lodestar analysis here in the due\nprocess appeal -- in Buford, the Court said it did not\ndefine it with precision, but it has always been\nfundamental fairness, a community sense of fair play and\ndecency.\nIt seems to me that, as you move into a\njudge with absolutely no mantle of State authority or --\nand -- whatsoever, versus a juror who is properly sworn,\nproperly instructed, but who nevertheless sits from a\ndifferent neighboring jurisdiction -- and I should note\nthat in Cook County there are three jury jurisdictions,\nso the errors could be legion just within Cook County in\nterms of being from the wrong part of the county. It\nseems to me that that sort of error simply doesn't come\nanywhere close to the fundamental fairness --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- but how do\nyou -- there is no way to tell. I mean, presumably the\nState has a reason for restricting the jury pool to the\nneighborhood, and that type of limitation does go back\nto Blackstone, the vicinage of the crime. So -- and the\nthere's no way to tell. There's no way to tell whether\nthe juror from DuPage County is going to have a\ndifferent view of a different perspective or affected it\nin a -- or that it affected the verdict in a particular\ncase.\nMR. SCODRO: This is true, Your Honor, but\nin those contexts, the very State law that has created\nthose divisions, for whatever reason they have seen fit\nto do so, is the proper authority to conclude whether or\nnot the error is so profound by having that person sit\nthat it ought not be a violation of due process -- that\nit ought to be a void judgment. That's how these\nFederal cases, Gomez and others --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did -- that's exactly what\nI can't figure out. I'm trying -- forget due process.\nAll right? Keep that out of your mind. We have\napproximately 50 State jurisdictions, the District of\nColumbia, and a bunch of Federal jurisdictions. All\nright? In those jurisdictions, to your knowledge -- you\nmay not know this, you may not have looked it up -- but\nwhat happens in the situation where a juror -- where a\njuror should have been excused? I guess there's a new\ntrial. The juror should have been excused, but wasn't.\nI guess there's a new trial normally; is that right?\nMR. SCODRO: If the juror is biased, yes,\nbut not if the juror is unbiased --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the juror is biased.\nYes. Okay.\nNow suppose it's the defendant who wanted\nthe juror and he was wrongly excused. All right? So\nthat's what the appeals court holds. What's the rule?\nAgain, do they go back and look and see if it's biased?\nIf the juror -- if the defendant didn't get the juror he\nwanted, somebody else took his place, do they look to\nsee if that person was biased? And if not, say, too\nbad, defendant, you may have been right, but you lost\nthe jury that you want, no remedy? What happens?\nMR. SCODRO: It's my understanding -- I\ndon't believe -- I don't have cases to cite on that --\nbut I don't believe there would be a remedy because this\nCourt has said time and again that the preemptory right\nand those surrounding it do not create a right to any\nparticular jury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, at least in the case of\nwhere he failed to get a preemptory, whether it's\nFederal or whether it's State, the Federal law and most\nState law is: You lost your right to a preemptory, one\nof them. You should have had it, but you are out of\nluck, if -- if the juror who replaced the replacement,\nthe juror who was there, you know, who otherwise\nwouldn't have been is a fair juror.\nMR. SCODRO: Your Honor, I thought you were\nasking what happens if a particular juror the defendant\nwanted did not sit, and under those circumstances, I\nwould say that because this Court has held --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the last\nhypothetical?\nMR. SCODRO: If you question -- that\nindicates really the split in this case, Your Honor, and\nthe indirect split that was -- all of which was laid out\nin the cert petition. There is -- there is\ndisagreement, but we would note that much of the\ndisagreement -- some of it -- is true Martinez-Salazar,\nfootnote 4 with its remarks about Swain. Some of it is\nFederal, and therefore you don't have the same concern\nabout a threshold due process violation.\nI will say, to answer your original question\nas well about jurors who should not have sat but are not\ndeemed biased, Illinois certainly has a history of cases\nto that effect, and the court -- the Illinois court has\nhandled them as a matter of Illinois law. The case in\n1986, an alien sat, and the court concluded there was no\ntimely objection that was part of this analysis, but it\ncertainly was not a \"nullity,\" in the court's words,\nunder those circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What was that case?\nMR. SCODRO: This is not cited in the\nbriefs, so I'm only citing it in response to a question.\nIt's a case called Chase from the Illinois Supreme Court\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, Illinois --\nMR. SCODRO: -- in 1886. And it's a case in\nwhich an alien sat on the jury, and there was, I\nbelieve, as part of the court's analysis a failure to\nmake a contemporaneous objection, but they said it was\nnot a \"nullity,\" to use the court's words, to seat this\nimproper juror and, again, made as a determination of\nIllinois law, just as the question here as to what\nremedy should be in effect is purely a question of\nIllinois law.\nAgain, they have simply failed to establish\na due process violation. This Court has said time and\nagain there is no due process entitlement to peremptory\nchallenges. Much of what we accept as given these days\ndepends, hinges, upon that presumption, including the\nBaston line, as the concurrence in Miller-El pointed out\nin 2005, numerous restrictions on peremptories that have\nbeen upheld since the 19th century, which are laid out\nin the government's brief. And then, indeed, the\nremarkable variety amongst States, which has been\ntouched upon today, where States -- State by State --\nprovide very different numbers of peremptory challenges,\nand they provide very different limits thereon as well.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the judge who sat on a\nState trial was not authorized under State law to hear\nthat particular matter, would that be a due process\nviolation?\nMR. SCODRO: I think the answer to that is\nno, Your Honor. And indeed, as we point out in our\nbrief, Cook County has several substantive divisions, so\nthat, for example, a criminal law division judge is not\nauthorized to sit on a family law matter, for example.\nAnd yet Illinois law has made clear that if there's an\nerror, if you go to the wrong court and that is unlikely\nto happen in the scenario I put forth, but it could\neasily happen between law and chancery for example, and\ndoes indeed happen. If that were be the case, the --\nany error in going to the wrong court and having the\nwrong court resolve your issue does not void the\njudgment as a matter of law. And I certainly don't\nthink that would implicate due process concerns.\nIf the Court has no further questions, we\nwould ask that you affirm the judgment below.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Roberts?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFederal law does not require automatic\nreversal of a conviction because the denial of a\nperemptory challenge at most violated only his State law\nrights. And even if his Federal constitutional rights\nhad been violated, harmless error review would apply.\nThe Constitution does not give criminal defendants the\nright to peremptory challenges; therefore, a -- the\nright of a State defendant like Petitioner to exercise\nperemptory challenges derives entirely from State law,\nand when erroneous denial of a preemptory challenge\ndeprives him only of State law right, and when the State\nlaw rights alone have been violated, State law not\nfederal law dictates whether harmless error review\napplies. The violation of a State law right doesn't\nrise to a due process -- federal due process violation\nunless it deprives the defendant of a fair trial.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly held\nthat States can withhold preemptory challenges entirely\nwithout impairing the right to an impartial jury or a\nfair trial. It, therefore, follows that the erroneous\ndenial of a single preemptory challenge does not render\na trial fundamentally unfair.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if it's not a single\nchallenge. What if, let's say, each side has six, and\nthe trial judge just arbitrarily refuses to allow a\ndefendant to exercise any preemptory challenge, but the\njury -- the jury is ultimately selected, there is no\nreason to think it's not a fair jury?\nMR. ROBERTS: We'd still thing that that\nwould not be a federal constitutional violation, and\neven if it were some kind of a federal violation, that\nit would be subject to review for harmlessness. If the\ntrial court could violate due process, if its actions so\nskewed the balance of power over the selection of the\njury in favor of the government that it resulted in a\nfundamentally unfair trial, but even the denial of\nmultiple preemptory challenges wouldn't rise to that\nlevel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the Illinois had a\nstatute that the prosecution gets 10 peremptories and\nthe defendants get one, would that raise a federal\nquestion?\nMR. ROBERTS: The question there would be\nwhether that so skewed -- the test that I said before.\nI think the question would be that that's so skewed\nabout --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the answer pretty\nclear that that would be unfair.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't -- I don't think that\nthe answer is clear at all. The State might rationally\nconclude that because the government has to prove its\ncase beyond a reasonable doubt, because it has to\nconvince the jurors unanimously to rule in its favor and\nbecause it has no right to appeal an unfavorable\ndetermination by the jury, that the prosecution should\nbe entitled to more preemptory challenges. Of course,\nthis case doesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I will use that as an\nexamination question but let's hope it doesn't come up.\nMR. ROBERTS: It's unlikely to, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The reason it's unlikely\nis it is so clearly unconstitutional.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we don't think it's\nunconstitutional at all, Your Honor, but it is contrary\nto what the common practice and the way things have been\napproached in both the federal and State court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, if you do\nget to harmless error, how do you deal with the question\nthat was raised by the Chief Justice, that is, there is\nno way in the world that you can tell whether this was\nharmless or not? You would have to imagine another\njuror being on the panel, that juror could have swung\nthe case, could have had no influence, there is just no\nway of knowing what would happen.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that rests on\nthe mistaken premise that harmless error now just turns\non the predilections of the particular decisionmaker or\non speculation about what one particular juror would\nhave done differently than another. In fact, harmless\nerror -- the harmless error inquiry looks at the\nhypothetical objective rational juror. And so, that's\nwhat you look at and the difference between --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but maybe --\nmaybe you have an -- you know, the irrational juror.\nYou know, the holdout is not going to convict for any\nreason.\nMR. ROBERTS: But -- but that is not an\nappropriate part of -- of a harmless error analysis just\nlike the fact that the jury might engage in\nnullification is an appropriate part of the harmless\nelement.\nIf -- in Strickland, which is the best case,\nI think, to explain how that is irrelevant to the\ninquiry, even though it's part of the constitutional\nthere -- analysis there, the Court very clearly explains\nthat you don't look at the particular decisionmaker, you\ndon't speculate about nullification and about arbitrary\naction and the like, it sort of transferable over.\nThat's just not an appropriate part -- analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even assuming\nyour premise, isn't it pretty difficult to know what a\nrational juror would have done?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we think that the\ncorrect inquiry in this circumstance, given the nature\nof the right, is to ask whether the error resulted in\nthe seating of a juror that was not impartial. And then\nyou look at the record in the case, the voir dire\nrecord, and make that determination, and the government\nbears the -- bears the burden of proof.\nSo we don't think that that would be\ndifficult to do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that is almost the\nsame, at least in some states, as getting a new trial\nanyway. If we find out after the fact that the jury was\nbiased, and in some States that's a reason for a new\ntrial in the discretion of the trial court, anyway.\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that -- that could be,\nbut --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The point is you are not\ngiving much substance to the rule.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think we are\nrespecting its fundamental -- its fundamental purpose,\nYour Honor, which is to assist to help achieve the goal\nof selecting an impartial juror.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the law there?\nThat's what I am trying to get at. I mean, my initial\ninstinct would be that if a defendant doesn't get the\njury that the law entitles him to, that's an error. And\nyou normally would think it was harmful, because you\ncan't say, in honesty, it was harmless, it's the jury\nthat's supposed to decide. I suspect it would work out\nthat way. I have never looked into it. How has it\nworked out?\nMR. ROBERTS: Generally for errors like the\nerror you described before, where the judge\nerroneously -- mistakenly excuses a juror in the belief\nthat the juror is disqualified for cause, where the\njudge mistakenly substitutes a qualified alternate for\none of the jurors, or the judge places one alternate on\nthe jury instead of another, the courts have generally\nlooked at that for harmlessness and has not required\nautomatic reversal.\nIndeed, even in the case of jurors that\ndon't satisfy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So in other\nwords, they have often said you don't get a new trial?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. And even in the case of\njurors that don't meet the statutory requirements in the\nfederal courts of appeals have held that unless a biased\njuror sits, a new trial is not required.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But don't some of those\ncourts, rather than focusing on the qualifications of\nthe particular juror, look to the -- how close the case\nwas?\nMR. ROBERTS: The harmless error analysis,\nthere are sort of a lot of different scenarios of types\nof violations, and the standard that they use is not\nclear in all of them. In the ones that -- the cases\nthat I found that involve the seating of jurors that\ndon't meet the federal statutory requirements, usually\nthey involve felons that didn't reveal that they were\nfelons, the courts have looked to the biased juror\nstandard.\nSome courts have done that, others have\nlooked to whether it affects the verdict. They haven't\nbeen exactly clear how you determine that, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's because there\nis no way to tell.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I think that --\nthat even if you had a standard that said to look to\nwhether there was an effect on the verdict, you can tell\nprecisely the way the Illinois Supreme Court applied\nNeder here, if no rational jury could have acquitted,\nthen you know the substitution of one rational,\nimpartial juror for another didn't have an effect on the\noutcome. And that doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment\nto do that, Your Honor, because the underlying right --\nthe underlying error doesn't violate the Sixth\nAmendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But a jury is a\nfundamental protection of individual liberty, and in\nyour analysis you are having a judge decide what the\njury would --\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. As\nJustice Ginsburg pointed out before, the Petitioner here\ngot a determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\non every element of the offense from a fair and\nimpartial jury that was properly instructed. So we are\nnot having a judge substitute that at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The judge is making\na determination that a juror that should have been\nsitting would act like the juror who was sitting\ninstead.\nMR. ROBERTS: That is true. But the Sixth\nAmendment doesn't give the defendant the right to any\nparticular jury, it doesn't give the defendant the right\nto a jury that has been selected in compliance with\nevery jot and frivolous State law. And therefore, if\nthe underlying error, as the underlying error here where\nyou get a denial of preemptory, where a juror is seated\nthat even though that violated state law, assumably\nhere, that -- that that doesn't amount to a Sixth\nAmendment violation.\nAnd if the defendant got his Sixth Amendment\nrights at trial, then the way you conduct harmless error\nreview can't violate his Sixth Amendment rights. He\nalready got them. And so it can be done and it doesn't\nviolate the Sixth Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are any number of\nalternatives that we can adopt in ruling for your\nposition. If we were to rule for your position, what do\nyou think is the most straightforward rationale?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- we would obviously\nlike to have sort of alternative rulings that do both,\nbut I think the most logical way to approach the case is\nto decide whether there was a violation of the\nConstitution here, and because there wasn't one, to say\nthat State law governs the harmless error analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Leven, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. LEVEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LEVEN: Your Honor, the Hicks v.\nOklahoma case is a very important case as far as the due\nprocess right to a unlawful adjudicator, because there\nwe had an unlawful sentencer. So, I would ask that the\nCourt consider that, that's a State case involving an\nunlawful adjudicator. So we do have a due process\nviolation under that case.\nAs to the Sixth Amendment issue, the\nIllinois Supreme Court did act inconsistently with the\nSixth Amendment as far as its manner of conducting\nharmless error review, because harmless error review is\nimpossible to conduct in this situation, because in\norder to do that, we would have to examine what the\nparticular jury would have done had it not been for the\nerror; and the particular jury in this case must be out,\nbecause there the particular jury, the panel as a whole,\nis illegally constituted, and the -- and it's impossible\nto conduct your harmless error analysis.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that any harder than\nharmless error analysis that is conducted all the time?\nFor example evidence is erroneously excluded from the\ntrial, and you ask was that a harmless error? But you\nhave to -- there has to be speculation about how this\njury would have received the additional evidence. What\n-- what's the difference?\nMR. LEVEN: Because in that situation, we\nare looking at what the particular jury, how a\nparticular jury in that case would have resolved the\nmatter had the erroneously admitted evidence not been\nadmitted.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the court has no -- has\nno inside information about the dynamics of that\nparticular jury. It's just -- it's deciding what a\nrational jury would do, what a -- what a standard jury\nwould do.\nMR. LEVEN: Whether that particular jury\nwould have reached the same verdict, which we can't do\nin this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. But how does the Court\nknow anything particular about the jury when it conducts\nthat harmless error analysis? It doesn't.\nMR. LEVEN: It probably could look at the\nrecord as a whole to determine whether or not the -- the\nparticular jury that rendered the verdict would have\ndone the same thing had the erroneously admitted\nevidence not -- not been -- not been introduced.\nAnd in this case, we have a very different\nsituation. We have an illegal adjudicator, and we can't\ndetermine whether that adjudicator would have resolved\nthe case differently had it not been -- it's impossible\nto assess because of the -- the particular adjudicator\nthat resolved this case, in the present case, was\nillegally composed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
