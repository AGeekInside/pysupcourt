        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 09-571, Connick v. Thompson.\nMr. Duncan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DUNCAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case asks when a district attorney's\noffice may be liable under section 1983 for inadequately\ntraining prosecutors. The Petitioner, Orleans Parish\nDistrict Attorney's Office, was found liable for the\nterrible injuries caused to Mr. Thompson by a Brady\nviolation on the theory the office was deliberately\nindifferent to Brady training, this despite the fact\nthat there was proved no pattern of previous misconduct\nby office prosecutors.\nThe district court exempted this case from\nthe ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed\nanalogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton\nopinion. There, the Court suggested that a city may be\nliable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police\nofficers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly\nforce.\nExtending that hypothetical to this case was\nerror. It misunderstood Canton's distinction between\nsingle-incident and pattern liability, nullifying\nCanton's stringent standards of fault and causation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't this something in\nbetween? Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one\nrookie police officer. Here, it wasn't one rogue\nprosecutor. There were four prosecutors who knew of\nthis blood evidence, and there were multiple\nopportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them\napparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this\nquiet.\nNow, if we were just talking about -- what\nwas his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case.\nBut we have the three other prosecutors. And so I think\nit's questionable to characterize this as a single\nincident.\nMR. DUNCAN: I understand your question,\nJustice Ginsburg. Our argument does not turn on whether\nit was one or three or four prosecutors. What our\nargument does turn on is that the theory from the Canton\nhypothetical, which does not require a pattern, was\nclearly at issue in this case. The district court\nanalogized to Canton in order to allow the jury to find\nliability absent a pattern.\nThere is no question that, whether it was\none or four prosecutors, this is a single incident of a\nBrady violation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this is a\nsingle incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort\nis likely to happen without training, then one incident\nis enough.\nEvery prosecutor knows that there can be\nBrady violations if people are not taught what Brady\nmeans, because it's not self-evident in every situation,\ncorrect?\nMR. DUNCAN: That's -- that's true, Justice\nSotomayor. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So if you\nknow that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors'\noffices are filled with young ADAs who have just come\nout of law school. If you know that they are going to\nmeet some situations where the answer is not intuitively\nknown, like that if you get a lab report, you should\nturn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that\nwhat the jury said, to train them to turn over lab\nreports?\nNow, I know you claim you had that policy.\nMR. DUNCAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can talk later about\nwhether or not there was sufficient evidence for the\njury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not.\nThat's a sufficiency of the evidence question.\nBut if you know that lab reports have to be\nturned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not\nto do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no\npolicy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had\nno policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible\nfor a Canton-like violation?\nMR. DUNCAN: The question is under the Brady\nscenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on?\nDoes it fall on the single-incident line or the pattern\nline? We say it falls on the pattern line.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Life doesn't always come\nin just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this\ndoesn't fit into a single rookie.\nYou have -- if you have four prosecutors who\nare not turning over this evidence, then it seems like\nthere's kind of a culture in the office that we don't\nturn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because\none suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will\nshow you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from\nThompson to have it mean anything.\nSo there was misunderstanding about that.\nBut what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into\na single incident, it doesn't fit. So we have a\nsituation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly\nconfronted before.\nMR. DUNCAN: I think the Court has in\nCanton, Your Honor. Let me answer it this way: If we\npay close attention to the function of the\nsingle-incident hypothetical in Canton, I think it\nilluminates the kind of notice, the kind of fault, and\nthe kind of causation that needs to arise out of a\ngeneral situation.\nSo looking carefully, what Canton said is:\nA policymaker who fails to give police officers the\nbasic constitutional standard for deadly force, which\nthey are not equipped to know in the beginning, and\nwithout which they --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you tell me -- I\nthink I have a copy.\nMR. DUNCAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes.\nThis is -- this is -- I'm referring to the -- the basic\nCanton standard is at 390, page 390 of the Canton\nopinion. And specifically, the footnote is footnote 10,\nthat discusses the two possibilities, the no-pattern and\nthe pattern possibilities.\nSo -- and I'm reading from Canton at\nfootnote 10. City policymakers know -- \"For example,\"\nthe Court said, \"city policymakers know to a moral\ncertainty that their police officers will be required to\narrest fleeing felons. The city has armed its officers\nwith firearms, in part to allow them to accomplish this\ntask. Thus, the need to train officers in the\nconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force...\ncan be said to be 'so obvious' that the failure to do\nso\" is \"deliberate indifference.\"\nNow, what we have there, as Justice\nO'Connor's concurrence in that case and then later the\nCourt's opinion in Bryan County explain, you have a\nfailure to inform city personnel of the basic standard\nwithout which they have no hope of doing their job in a\nconstitutional manner. So you put your employees in a\nsituation of impossibility, and when a deadly force\nviolation occurs, what you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These are people who\nhaven't gone to law school, right?\nMR. DUNCAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do not know that you\ncannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?\nMR. DUNCAN: They've got no background\nequipment to know what the constitutional standard is.\nAnd so that satisfies, in a general situation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you were giving guns to\nlawyers, it might have been different.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DUNCAN: It could be, Your Honor.\nHere, you're giving --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Depending on the law school\nthey went to or what?\n{Laughter.)\nMR. DUNCAN: It could be.\nHowever, what you are giving to lawyers here\nis the task of analyzing legal judgments. Can lawyers'\njudgments go astray, Justice Sotomayor? Absolutely.\nAbsolutely. But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now what you're\nsuggesting is that for certainty you know that a\nlawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a\nparticular area of law is that complicated.\nYour people disagreed -- some of your people\ndisagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab\nreport was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when\nyou didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady\nviolation. That has been conceded in this case, so I\naccept as a working proposition that they should have\nknown that.\nWhat you're suggesting is you get a pass\nbecause, even though you know that there's an area of\nlaw that a young lawyer is not going to be able to\nfigure out on their own, you fail to train them and\nyou're okay.\nMR. DUNCAN: Well, that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not the Canton\nexample.\nMR. DUNCAN: That is not -- that's the\nCanton example, Your Honor. What we have here --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what you're\nsaying.\nMR. DUNCAN: No, that's not what we're\nsaying. We're not saying that the policymaker\ninevitably knows my prosecutors are going to make this\nmistake, and so I need to train on it and I don't care\nabout training on it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then why don't we\njust --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can we just -- can we clear\nsomething up?\nMR. DUNCAN: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you -- are you accepting\nthe proposition that Brady always requires that lab\nreports be turned over?\nMR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. What we would\nconcede in this case is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I know you concede that\nthere was a Brady violation here --\nMR. DUNCAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- but in answer to some of\nthe questions, it seems to me you were possibly -- or at\nleast you did not express an opinion on the suggestion\nthat it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn\nover a lab report.\nMR. DUNCAN: I'm not aware that it would\nalways be a violation of Brady. However, of course, we\nhave evidence in this case that the -- uncontradicted\nevidence, that the office policy was to turn over all\nscientific reports. But --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Duncan, could I give you\na hypothetical -- -\nMR. DUNCAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- just to test how strong\nyour position is here.\nSo let's say that there is a new DA comes to\ntown, and he says, there's going to be one attorney per\ncase from now on, and it will be a random assignment\nsystem. So sometimes important cases will be tried by\nexperienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by\npeople right out of law school. And there will be no\nBrady supervision at all, no Brady training. And there\nis a closed file system, that we only turn over what\nwe're required to turn over and not anything else.\nAnd in addition to that, if I, the DA, find\nthat you have turned over things that you're not\nrequired to turn over, that will be taken into account\nin your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary\npurposes, et cetera. That will be very severely frowned\nupon.\nSo he, the new DA --\nMR. DUNCAN: I'm sorry -- repeat the last\npart again, the \"severely frowned upon\" part.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: If you turn over anything\nthat you didn't have to. Okay?\nMR. DUNCAN: Exactly. I understand.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: If you give any material\nthat you're not required to do by law.\nAnd so he puts into place this whole system\nand -- and says, okay, go to it. And what happens is\nthat there are Brady violations. And there's a Brady\nviolation in a capital case and the person sits on death\nrow, or the person is executed, whichever, and there's a\nclaim brought.\nIs that claim not a good claim?\nMR. DUNCAN: If there is a pattern of\ndemonstrated --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: There's not a pattern,\nbecause he just came to town and he just, you know,\ninstituted all these policies, and this is the first\nBrady violation.\nMR. DUNCAN: Not for the first Brady\nviolation, Justice Kagan. But in your hypothetical, you\nnoted a policy of actually assigning inexperienced\nprosecutors randomly to perhaps high-profile cases.\nIf that were the facts, the jury, as they\ncould have in this case, could have found that an\nofficial policy actually caused the violation. But they\ndidn't find it in this case. So the hypo leaves open\nthat possibility.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the failure to train or\nsupervise in any way and the setting up a structural\nsystem that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady\nviolations, that would not be enough?\nIn other words, even if the jury said yes,\nyou are liable under that second theory -- not the\npolicy theory, but the failure to train and supervise\ntheory -- that -- that would have to be rejected?\nMR. DUNCAN: No -- exactly, Your Honor. No\nliability there, because it doesn't meet the stringent\nfault and causation standards of Canton.\nThis goes back to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is that so? The\n-- I've read the instruction that the court gave, and it\nseemed to me the instruction the Court gave was\nword-for-word taken from Canton. And when I read the\nquestion that you presented in your Petitioner's brief\n-- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case\nwas about was an instance where there was only -- it was\nconceded that there was only one such instance.\nBut then when I read your second reiteration\nof the question, which is a little different, and read\nthe briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones.\nAnd so what you're really asking us to do is to decide\nin the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence\nsupports them. I didn't think I was getting into that,\nand, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly\nsupports it, but others could disagree. But why are we\ngetting into that business in this Court?\nMR. DUNCAN: We're not asking you to.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then what is it\nyou're asking? Is there something in the instructions\nthat is wrong? What?\nMR. DUNCAN: Yes, the instructions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. DUNCAN: -- reflect that the single\nincident theory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. Where -- I'm\nreading the instruction. I have it here. What is it?\nI'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying, what in\nthe words stated are wrong? And where is the request\nthat they be stated differently? That I should look at\nthat, and that they weren't. Okay.\nMR. DUNCAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. Let me\nhelp you with that. The -- the -- at the Joint Appendix\npage 828, we have the instructions on deliberate\nindifference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What's\nthe page number.\nMR. DUNCAN: 828.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 828.\nMR. DUNCAN: Joint Appendix 828.\nThere are the instructions on deliberate\nindifference. Let me start here, Justice Breyer. These\ninstructions are taken from the Second Circuit's Walker\ndecision, which was the first court that I am aware of\nto allow for the possibility of single-incident\nliability in a Brady situation.\nThe second instruction there allows a\nchoice. It allows a choice for the jury to find that a\nsingle-incident situation -- I'm sorry -- that a\nsituation involving a Brady decision could arise and be\na basis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the words -- I\nmean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are\npretty similar to my copy of what he actually said. So\nwhat are the words on page 828 that you think he should\nhave said that he didn't say?\nMR. DUNCAN: \"The situation involved a\ndifficult choice or one that prosecutors had a history\nof mishandling.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. What he says\nhere is, \"The situation involved a difficult choice or\none that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling,\nsuch that additional training, supervision, or\nmonitoring was clearly needed.\"\nSo it looks to me like, unless I'm reading\nthe wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo\nhere. It looks to me like he gave those words.\nMR. DUNCAN: That is the -- I'm sorry. Then\nI misunderstood your question. Those are the actual\ninstructions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying what is it that\nyou asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you\nasked him not to do that he did do? That's what\nhappens. That's the way you object to an instruction.\nMR. DUNCAN: I understand, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So what is that?\nMR. DUNCAN: I misunderstood. I was reading\nwhere I thought the single-incident theory was posed in\nthe jury instructions. What the Petitioners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought he asked that.\nSo I was glad to see that. Thank you.\nMR. DUNCAN: The Petitioners specifically\nasked that an instruction be given that required a\npattern of similar violations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want you to point out in\nthe record the words that were said to the district\ncourt saying, Judge, I want you to say this, and then\nthe judge didn't do it.\nMR. DUNCAN: It is instruction number 14.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is where?\nMR. DUNCAN: The proposed instruction. I\nregret to say I don't believe that's in the Joint\nAppendix, Your Honor. And it is also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I think we take it as\nsaying that you not objecting to what -- to instruction.\nMR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, your whole brief is\nobjecting to the instruction, and you didn't include the\nobjection?\nMR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. The argument\nis not about the specific jury instruction. It's about\nthe legal theory. What it's about --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. If you don't\nobject to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm\nsaying, that what you're objecting to is you don't think\nthe evidence was such that, given that instruction, the\njury could find guilt. And that's what I thought this\ncase wasn't about to begin with, and there are three\nother instances. So I don't see why, given this\ninstruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.\nMR. DUNCAN: What our main complaint is, is\nabout the failure of the district court to grant a\nmotion for summary judgment and a judgment as a matter\nof law on the basis that a failure-to-train theory under\nthese circumstances does not permit the single -- the\nsingle-incident --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understood -- and\nmaybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there\nwas no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could\nbe handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to\ntrain for one incident.\nMR. DUNCAN: Absent a pattern. Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was the petition as\nit came --\nMR. DUNCAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it doesn't matter\nwhat the facts are. The facts that Justice Kagan gave\nyou would never constitute an actionable claim against a\nprosecutor; is that your position in this case?\nMR. DUNCAN: That's -- under the Canton\nhypothetical, yes. It would have to fall on the pattern\nside because the general Brady situation is unlike the\nsingle-incident --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I add to my\nhypothetical, then?\nMR. DUNCAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose that this new\ndistrict attorney said -- you know, every day he came\ninto the office and he said: I think Brady is just\ncrazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the\nSupreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't\nget caught, anything you do is okay by me.\nMR. DUNCAN: That sounds like a policy to\nme, Your Honor. That sounds like a policy, an\nactionable policy on the part of the policymaker.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a policy. He's\njust, you know, making his views known around the\noffice.\nMR. DUNCAN: Well, this Court has defined\n\"policy\" as a deliberate choice to embark on a course of\naction in Pembaur, which this Court accepted. That\nsounds like a policy to me. If it's not a policy --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Then the policy is just that\nyou -- you have to turn over what you have to turn over,\nnothing else, and if you turn over anything else you'll\nget penalized for doing so. That's the policy.\nMR. DUNCAN: Well, then the policy is\nconstitutional. So what we would look to is, are\nprosecutors failing to exercise their judgment properly\npursuant to that policy? And that falls very squarely\nwithin the second part of the Canton choices, which\nrequires a pattern.\nThis case is about the alleged failure to\nremedy, to guide, to reinforce, the pre-existing legal\njudgment that a prosecutor has by virtue of being a\nlegal professional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so? I mean, you\nare assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a\ncourse in criminal procedure, and I think there are many\nlaw schools where they don't even have such a course and\nothers where most -- I don't know anywhere it's\ncompulsory to take a course in criminal procedure. So\nyou're assuming that. And, of course, the time is\nrunning. There's something I wanted to ask you about\nBrady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would\nwant special vigilance. And that is, Miranda warnings,\nyou know what was said; search and seizure, you know\nwhat the police did. But the problem with Brady -- and\nthis case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know.\nIf the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do,\nthere's a very high risk, as there was in this case,\nthat it will never come to light.\nSo, recognizing the legal obligation of the\nprosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady\nevidence because it doesn't help the State's case,\nshouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking\nabout a Brady claim?\nMR. DUNCAN: Well, of course, there should\nbe vigilance, but the question you pose,\nJustice Ginsburg, is whether the latency, the\nhiddenness, that characterizes Brady violations should\nchange where we locate the Canton violation. Should it\nbe enough to put it into the single-incident, so-obvious\ncategory, or still in the pattern category? But Canton\ndoesn't indicate that the latency of a particular\nviolation should -- should turn on which category it\ngoes into. Instead, it's the nature of the employee\nduties and the employees themselves and how\nthat situation gives notice to a policymaker about when\nthere are obvious training risks. That's what we're\ntalking about.\nSo to go back to the hypothetical in Canton,\nwhether or not a deadly force situation is secret or\nnot -- of course, it's not. But the office has failed\nnot just to train, but to inform of the basic\nconstitutional duty without which those officers have no\nchance of fulfilling their duties. And when they do a\ndeadly force violation under those circumstances, the\ncausal link will be very strong. It will be strong\nenough to meet Canton.\nAnd so there you have -- there you have a\nsituation where deliberate indifference and causation\nare met without the pattern. But what -- you do not\nhave that in the situation of Brady compliance because,\nas -- as everyone agrees Brady involves gray areas. It\nis -- it is impossible to determine beforehand exactly\nwhy a Brady violation will occur and what specific\ntraining measures would prevent it from occurring.\nAnd what that means is this falls plainly\nwithin what Canton said about the pattern situation.\nAnd here's what Canton said in the footnote 10 following\nonto the hypothetical. \"It could also be that the\npolice, in exercising their discretion, so often violate\nconstitutional rights that the need for further training\nmust have been plainly obvious....\"\nThat's the situation we have posed by the\nBrady situation in general.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But, look -- I\n-- he read the instructions. They came right out of\nCanton. Seems perfect.\nNow you're saying, well, whether they did or\nnot, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have\nliability if there's only one incident. And at that\npoint, I say, gee, I don't know. I mean, maybe it\ndepends on what the incident is. Maybe the incident\ninvolved somebody saying, hey, Brady? What's Brady? Or\nsomebody saying, what's a criminal trial? I mean, that\nperson needs training.\nAnd -- or -- but I don't even have to think\nof that here, because there were four incidents here.\nAnd, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird\nhypotheticals. So where we have four instances and we\nhave correct instructions, what's the problem?\nMR. DUNCAN: Your Honor, there weren't four\ninstances. There was one Brady violation that possibly\ncould have involved one to four prosecutors. That's\none --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. We have -- we\nhave -- all this case? I thought that they had several\ninstances in other cases.\nMR. DUNCAN: No. No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All involved -- in other\nwords, there has never in this office been an instance\nof a Brady violation outside of this case.\nMR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. That's not\ntrue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not before this\ncase. There was some --\nJUSTICE BREYER: After, that's what it was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- later, as far as we\nknow.\nMR. DUNCAN: There were some -- there were\nfour reported Brady violations before this case, in the\ndecade leading up, involving this office, that had\nnothing to do with the circumstances involved here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. There were four Brady\nviolations involving this office, okay?\nMR. DUNCAN: Correct, out of tens of\nthousands of prosecutions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now we're\ntalking about not one; we are talking about four --\nMR. DUNCAN: We're -- but we're not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- over many years, with\ntens of thousands of violations, correct?\nMR. DUNCAN: What was -- the Fifth Circuit\npanel in this case affirmatively said Thompson did not\neven try to prove a pattern, and he did not prove a\npattern of violations. The Fifth Circuit panel said\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is helpful. Thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On your instruction in --\nMR. DUNCAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at J.A. 28 second,\nwould the instruction in your view have been proper, if\nthe \"or\" had been replaced by an \"and.\" So: \"The\nsituation involved a difficult choice and one that\nprosecutors had a history of mishandling.\"\nMR. DUNCAN: That's closer to what it should\nbe, Justice Kennedy, yes, because that begins to capture\nthe pattern requirement. It's not -- it's not the\npattern instruction that was specifically put forth by\nthe Petitioners in instruction number 15.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Has there been -- has\nthere been any argument that you have waived your\nobjection to the instructions?\nMR. DUNCAN: Not by Petitioners -- not by\nthe Respondent in this case. There's no -- there's no\n-- question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you -- did you object\nto it? To this charge?\nMR. DUNCAN: The -- the charge?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: With the \"or\" --\ndifficult choice \"or\" one that prosecutors had a history\nof mishandling.\nMR. DUNCAN: No, the Petitioners did not\nobject to the -- the specific formulation of that\ncharge. Immediately after that charge, though, they --\nthey said, no, but we -- we have to have a pattern\ninstruction here. In other words --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the\npattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?\nMR. DUNCAN: It was rejected. It was\nrejected twice, Your Honor, first in the formal jury\ninstructions and then at the charge colloquy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that wasn't the\nquestion presented to us. You didn't present to us an\nissue of whether the jury instruction --\nMR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- was wrong or not.\nMR. DUNCAN: What we present is the legal\ntheory on which this case was submitted -- what got to\nthe jury in the first place never should have got to\nthat legal theory at all.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, what I'm trying\nto figure out is whether your position is that under no\ncircumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan\nset forth, could you be charged with a single-incident\nCanton violation. That is your -- your theory?\nMR. DUNCAN: With respect to the Brady\nsituation, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Brady situation.\nMR. DUNCAN: Let me answer it this way:\nWhat -- what the Canton single-incident hypo is talking\nabout is failing to provide employees with basic tools,\nwithout which they absolutely have no chance of\nfulfilling their constitutional obligations. If we --\nit's difficult to imagine that situation for\nprosecutors.\nIt is -- it's conceivable that a district\nattorney's office set up -- sets up a structure where\nprosecutors have no chance of even knowing whether\nthere's Brady evidence in the file. If you have that\nsituation, then it's closer to the Canton\nsingle-incident hypothetical, but not involving the\nexercise of legal judgment in particular cases. We say\nno.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how do you\nexercise legal judgment if you don't even know what\nyou're supposed to turn over? That was Justice\nGinsburg's question.\nMR. DUNCAN: That's exactly -- that's my\npoint. That's my point. If you don't -- if you don't\neven -- in other words, if you don't even have a police\nfile, for instance, you can't exercise your legal\njudgment if you don't even know what -- what the\nsubject of your legal -- the object of your legal\njudgment is.\nBut that's not this case. What we're\ntalking about here is a failure to remedy, reinforce,\nrefine existing legal judgment that prosecutors have.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. DUNCAN: If there are no further\nquestions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cooney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF J. GORDON COONEY, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. COONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAlthough the Petitioners' brief attempts to\nrelitigate factual issues that were resolved against\nthem by the jury, they have raised today only one\nquestion of law, and that is whether this Court should\nwrite into section 1983 a per se rule that the only way,\nthe only way, a civil rights victim can ever establish\nthe deliberate indifference of a district attorney is if\nhe can prove a prior significant history of assistant\nprosecutors violating other citizens' constitutional\nrights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For -- for Brady\nviolations. They limit the principle to Brady\nviolations.\nMR. COONEY: Yes, Your Honor. And I would\nsubmit that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a significant\nlimitation, don't you think?\nMR. COONEY: But I would submit, Your Honor,\nthat this Court's -- that their requirement for proving\ndeliberate indifference is, first, contrary to the\nteaching of this Court in Canton and subsequent cases.\nIt finds no place in the language of section 1983 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But at the -- but at the\noutset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong --\nthat you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to\nhave a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train\ncase. You didn't mention that.\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a failure-to-train\ncase; is it not?\nMR. COONEY: It is absolutely a deliberate\nindifference to the need to train and provide other\nprotections to the office.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think that's very\nimportant.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, if you could -- could\nyou just say as succinctly as possible what you would\ntell assistant district attorneys if you were the\ndistrict attorney for this jurisdiction, and you, with\nthe benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what\nkind of -- what would you tell them they should do with\nrespect to Brady?\nMR. COONEY: Yes, Your Honor. First of all\nI think Canton says you have to look at the specific\ncircumstances. And so I don't think there's a\none-size-fits-all way or message that has to be\nprovided.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but you are training\nthem, so: Now I want to tell you what you have to do\nunder Brady.\nMR. COONEY: Well, first --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you tell them?\nMR. COONEY: In this office, Your Honor, I\nthink the first thing one has to confront is Mr.\nConnick's testimony and, in fact, the concession that\nthe Petitioners made on pages 6 and 7 of their merits\nbrief that the office started with what the brief\ndescribed as \"Connick's disclosure policies were no\nmystery\" -- turn over what the law required and nothing\nmore. I mean, that would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well,\nJustice Alito's question was, what you would tell the\nassistant DAs? What's your answer?\nMR. COONEY: And Mr. Chief Justice, with --\nif -- first of all, I wouldn't start with that rule.\nBut if I started with that rule it would be incumbent\nupon me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't you start with\nthat rule? The rule is perfectly lawful, my goodness.\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I'm not saying it's\nan unlawful rule. However, it requires a countervailing\nmessage. And if you're going to adopt --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I really would appreciate it\nif you'd get to my question. Brady requires that\nexculpatory evidence be turned over. Now, do you -- do\nyou think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know\nthat?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I don't know that.\nIt seems from the record in this case they thought that\nonly something that screamed \"exculpatory evidence\" on\nits face needed to be turned over.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Now, you phrase --\nyou are the instructor. You phrase the lesson that you\nthink is required by Brady that has to be given to them.\nMR. COONEY: I think at a minimum it has two\npieces, Your Honor. It has basic instruction about how\nto go about fulfilling the Brady obligation, and how do\nyou go about looking through the file to make sure you\nknow what's there, making sure you have documents that\nare in the possession of the police.\nThinking in advance, as this Court talked\nabout in the Agurs case, about what the evidence is\ngoing to be at trial and looking thoughtfully at that\nevidence to determine whether or not the evidence was\nfavorable to the accused and needs to be produced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. That's your\ninstruction on Brady. Now, you're basing liability on\n-- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady. So\nyou say they should have instructed on Brady.\nWhat else should they have instructed on?\nMR. COONEY: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're the -- you're\nthe new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct\nmy people. What -- what do they instruct on? I know\nthey instruct on Brady under your view. What else?\nMR. COONEY: I think the second thing that\nthe -- that the office really should do is to -- to talk\nabout the importance of safeguarding the innocent here,\nthat our job is not just to secure convictions.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we're looking\nat -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to\nviolate the Constitution. I think that's a good thing,\nto tell them they have an obligation as well to protect\nthe innocent.\nBut we're worried about violations of our\nconstitutional requirements. We know Brady is one.\nWhat's the next one? What's day 2 in the course?\nMR. COONEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- I do\nthink that there are other constitutional requirements\ninvolved. Most of the hypotheticals, however, that have\nbeen brought before the Court as a parade of horribles\naren't actions by the district attorney.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, with respect, I\nreally don't think, as a young district -- assistant\ndistrict attorney, that you have told me anything that's\ngoing to be really helpful to me other than, you know,\nfollow the law, which you certainly should do, in\ndealing with my obligation to turn over physical\nevidence, which is what's involved here.\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Or a lab report regarding\nphysical evidence.\nNow, suppose I have -- I have several cases.\nI have this case, where I have got blood -- I have\nphysical evidence, I have a blood test. I have another\ncase where all I have was physical evidence, but there\nhas been no testing of it.\nNow, do I have to turn over that physical\nevidence?\nMR. COONEY: In this case, there has been a\nstipulation by the district attorney's office that you\ndo. And I think if you think about the evidence in this\ncase --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I have to turn over all\nphysical evidence that's in my possession?\nMR. COONEY: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay.\nMR. COONEY: But here, the specific --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, what's the instruction\nthat you're going to give me to tell me where I'm going\nto draw that line?\nMR. COONEY: If you have physical evidence\nthat, if tested, can establish the innocence of the\nperson who is charged, you have to turn it over.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do I know that\nbefore the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, didn't they here?\nDidn't they make it available?\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do I know that before\nthe physical evidence is tested?\nSuppose I've got all sorts of items that\nwere found at the -- at the scene, and they might have\nDNA on them. They might have epithelial samples on\nthem -- you know, all this fancy forensic testing that's\ndone these days. Do I have to turn over all of that?\nMR. COONEY: No, Your Honor. In this case,\nwhat we're talking about is a piece of evidence, a\nspecific piece, several specific pieces of physical\nevidence, that it has been stipulated the prosecutors\nknew contained the blood of the perpetrator.\nIt -- the rule and the training that should\nhave been provided in this instance, particularly since\nthe DA argues that it was perfectly clear that that\nshould have been produced --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, you see what I'm\ngetting at is that you're dealing with a very specific\nsituation. So the instruction would be: If you have\nphysical evidence and you have tested it for blood and\nyou have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but\nyou don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type\nof the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that\nhas to be turned over.\nAnd you're saying that the failure to\nprovide training to every assistant district attorney on\na question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a\npotential claim, gives rise to a claim?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, what I'm saying is\nI think there are at least three layers to the training\nthat were missing here. One was the clear message about\nthe importance of Brady compliance. The second was the\nbasic ground rules about how you go about your Brady\nobligation. And, third, if you have evidence that can\nconclusively establish to a scientific certainty the\ninnocence of the person being charged, you have to turn\nit over or get it -- get it tested. You can't just put\nit in your hip pocket and say, I know --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Wait a\nminute. What evidence is there that they put this in\ntheir hip pocket?\nThere was a disclosure that the evidence\nexisted. Where is the evidence that the defense counsel\ndidn't have access to asking for it?\nMR. COONEY: Yes, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or asking for it to be\ntested? Where was that suppressed?\nMR. COONEY: The -- the only information --\nthere was a discovery response that was filed very\nshortly before trial, long after Mr. Thompson was\ncharged with the crime, where in response to one of the\nquestions, the response was: \"Inspection to be\npermitted.\" If you look at the chronology --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what -- where's the\nBrady violation for telling a defense attorney there was\na blood sample there, you can test it?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, there was no\ninformation provided. It was -- the simple response was\nthat the request was for all scientific evidence, and it\nsimply -- and physical evidence from the scene of the\ncrime. The answer was: \"Inspection to be permitted.\"\nThen the blood evidence, the very next day,\nafter the response was provided, was removed from the\ncrime lab by the prosecutors, never to be found again.\nAnd defense counsel testified without impeachment at\ntrial that he went to the evidence locker, looked in the\nevidence locker, found certain pieces of physical\nevidence consistent with the discovery response, but not\nthe blood evidence, neither the blood report nor the\nphysical specimens that were involved in this case, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that you are claiming\nthere was suppression of that evidence?\nMR. COONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if it is --\nprosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional\nrights by making improper statements in their closing\narguments.\nDo you have to instruct new -- I suspect new\nprosecutors coming out of law school don't know what\nthose rules are. Do you have to give instruction on\nwhat they can say in closing arguments?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think, first of\nall, the issue has to rise to a constitutional level in\norder to be talking about this for section 1983\npurposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. My\nunderstanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in\ncriminal law. I need training in that. But my\nunderstanding is that comments in a closing argument can\ngive rise to a constitutional violation.\nSo you should -- you should train those\npeople. You know that. You know that that can happen,\njust as you know there can be Brady violations. So they\nneed training in exactly what they can say and can't say\nin closing argument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And Miranda and proper\nsupervision of affidavits in support of search warrants,\nand proper instructions that tell the police not to\nexceed the scope of the warrant. So this is -- our\ncourse is expanding.\nMR. COONEY: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the point of\nconcern here is that we're going to have to go through a\nlist, case by case, of everything there has to be\ntraining on.\nMR. COONEY: I think -- I think there are\nsome important distinctions here. And, first of all,\nwhen you're talking about search and seizure, when\nyou're talking about Miranda, you're talking about those\nthings, the actor that is committing the constitutional\ntort there is not the district attorney. It's the\npolice. What we're talking about here, the\nconstitutional tort --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you're talking\nabout improper comments in closing argument, it is the\nprosecuting attorney.\nMR. COONEY: But the second important\ndistinction, Your Honor -- and I do believe training\nshould be given there. But I think there's a\nfundamental distinction between a Brady violation, which\nhappens in private and may never be revealed and, if\nrevealed, often happens long after trial and long after\nincarceration, and a situation where a prosecutor makes\nan improper comment during a closing jury, which is made\nin public. Defense counsel has the opportunity right\nthere to stand up and say, Your Honor, I object, and the\ncourt has the ability to address that issue then and\nthere.\nWith a Brady violation, you don't have any\nof that. It's made in secret. It's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't -- you\ndon't have to train with respect to closing arguments?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think they do.\nBut I think there's -- there's a particular issue.\nThere's particular force in this context because of the\nunique nature of Brady, because it's made in private,\nbecause it is -- by definition, if the information has\nbeen concealed, it has not been revealed prior to the\ntime the defendant suffers constitutional harm. He's --\nhe's found guilty, he's sentenced to death, et cetera.\nThe Brady violation, unlike your situation,\nMr. Chief Justice, doesn't come to light, perhaps ever.\nBut in Mr. Thompson's case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have --\nMR. COONEY: -- more than a decade after he\nwas convicted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's something like I\nwas trying to get at before when I said Miranda is out\nthere, you know what was said, you know what was seized,\ntalking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn't\ncome out with it, high risk it will never come out.\nSo we have use of force, plus -- that can\nkill people if you're not properly trained. Brady,\nbecause if they don't come up with the information, it\ncould have what almost happened in this case.\nAnything else on this special list?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The concern was that you\ndon't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical\nlaw school course before you let them do their job.\nMR. COONEY: I agree with that concern, Your\nHonor. And -- and I think it's important to remember\nthat in this case, this was a no-training case. The\nevidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson was\nthere was zero Brady training in the office.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So what would have been\nenough? I mean, is an hour a year enough? Is an hour a\nmonth enough?\nMR. COONEY: I think that would have been\ndependent on what its content was, Your Honor, and the\nother circumstances of the office.\nIf you look at Canton, what Canton does is\nit asks the question: Is there an obvious need for\ntraining based on the circumstances of this\nparticular --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. As I understand it,\nyou -- you really have a need to train them, when you\nknow defense counsel is coming over to look at the\nphysical evidence, don't remove from the locker some of\nthe physical evidence.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to give a course\nin that?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, what -- what\nhappened is the physical evidence very conveniently was\nbeing sent to the crime lab when it was removed. And so\nwe don't know what the motivation was as to why that\nphysical evidence was removed at that time. What we\nknow is for many, many months --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, you shouldn't\nhave -- you shouldn't have mentioned it. I thought you\nwere -- you were asserting that it was intentionally\nremoved in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing\nit.\nMR. COONEY: What we assert, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that.\nMR. COONEY: It was certainly not -- it was\nintentionally not placed back in into evidence after it\ncame back from the crime lab, and there was actual\ntestimony from the grand jury that was handling this and\nlooking into this situation for some period of time --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, there's a\n--\nMR. COONEY: -- of not just that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There is a causation\nproblem here. Even assuming training, if Deegan was\ngoing to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as he\nadmitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lack\nof training is just irrelevant.\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think there\nare --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm very concerned\nabout that causation aspect.\nMR. COONEY: First of all -- let me address\nthat directly. First of all, the causation question was\nput to the jury; the jury instruction very clearly said\nin order for there to be liability here, the fault must\nbe in the training program, not in the individual\nprosecutor. And the defense argued vehemently that\nthere was a lack of causation. What's interesting here\nis --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the judge actually,\nthough, instructed the jury -- this is back on J.A.\n828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's\nfailure to adequately train, monitor, or supervise\namounted to -- deliberate indifference, et cetera.\nSo liability could have been predicated not\non the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a\nprocess by which superiors in the district attorney's\noffice reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were\nmade by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, the concept of\nmonitoring or supervision was actually a concept that\ndefendants injected into the case. And so, to the\nextent that there is any concern that there's an\nexpansion from training, it's been error that's invited.\nAnd I don't believe it's error, Your Honor, but it's not\nsomething that -- that was put into the case by the\ndefense or the court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't\nthat be error? That the -- the head of a very large\noffice is personally liable under Canton for violations\nthat are -- that are produced by actions taken by\nsubordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to\nreview all of the decisions that are made by those\nsubordinates? Doesn't that go well beyond anything\nCanton permits?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, again, the clear\nthrust of this case was a failure-to-train case. The\nconcept of monitoring and supervision was introduced by\nthe defense, not by the -- by the plaintiffs. But to\nget back to Justice Kennedy's case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you please state\nin simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train\nthese prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do?\nWhat training -- Justice Alito asked it generally; I'm\nasking specifically -- what is the exact training that\nwas required in this situation that caused the violation\nin this case?\nMR. COONEY: Number one, there was\nabsolutely no Brady training at all.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Forget about no Brady\ntraining. What -- I think Justice Alito asked this\nquestion. What specifically would the training have\nsaid or done that would have avoided this Brady\nviolation?\nMR. COONEY: First of all, I think a broad\nstatement in training about the importance of\nsafeguarding the rights of the accused --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, that seems to\nsuggest that you're claiming that if there was an\nintentional violation by the prosecutors, that that\nstatement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing\nsomething he or she knew was illegal. Is that what\nyou're intending?\nMR. COONEY: No, it isn't, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. So tell me.\nMR. COONEY: The -- the second aspect of --\nof it, though, is what I said to Justice Alito, and that\nis that if you have physical evidence which, if tested,\nwould establish either the guilt or the innocence of the\n-- of the defendant, it needs to be produced. Or at\nleast tested.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes to the\nsufficiency --\nMR. COONEY: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether they had a\npolicy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so\nthere was no Brady violation from the failure to test\nhere.\nMR. COONEY: The Brady violation was for\nfailure to produce; you're right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't -- am I right -- am I\nright on this? Here -- I read on page 4 of your brief\nthat it seemed what happened -- and I might not be\nright. Correct me if I'm not. What happened is a piece\nof paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the\nprosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what\nit said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was\ntype B. And the person on trial has blood of type O.\nIs that what happened?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, certainly what the\ncrime lab report said was that the blood that was tested\nof the perpetrator was type B.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the -- and the\nprosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?\nMR. COONEY: We don't know that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, that's something --\nMR. COONEY: That's the unresolved factual\nquestion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. COONEY: And I think that's where\ncausation comes in, Your Honor, because I think there\nare two possibilities.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did it turn out at the\ntrial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?\nMR. COONEY: It turned out that Mr. Thompson\nwas in fact type O. But the evidence is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: When the did they learn\nthat?\nMR. COONEY: The evidence is unclear as to\nwhether or not the assistants knew at the time that John\nThompson had type O blood.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask you what\n-- most law offices with which I'm familiar, the\ntraining is mentoring. In other words, the young\nattorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by\nfollowing them along -- around.\nWould it have been an adequate training\nprogram for this office simply to say, new prosecutors,\nyou don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after\na year, and you're going to follow one of the\nprosecutors around and learn from them? Is that an\nadequate training program?\nMR. COONEY: If, in fact, the senior\nprosecutors, Your Honor, have a good familiarity with\nthe constitutional requirements --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. COONEY: -- absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even -- even if the\nviolation that becomes the basis for the claim later on\nis one that, you know, didn't come up in that year? We\n-- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year.\nThey went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but\nthere wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn\nabout this type of question. And --\nMR. COONEY: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that give rise\nto a claim of the sort you're bringing here?\nMR. COONEY: I think the failure here -- and\nI think we have to come back to the deliberate\nindifference piece because what would happen there in\nthat instance, Your Honor, even if the training was not\nprovided, I think as experience has shown under Canton,\nthat claim would fail for failure to show the deliberate\nindifference of the policymaker.\nBut here you had substantial evidence about\nMr. Connick's indifference.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cooney, when you -- when\nyou gave the specific instruction that you think should\nbe provided to assistant district attorneys, what you\nstated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I\nthink. You -- did I understand you correctly?\nYou said that Brady means that if the\nprosecutor has physical evidence which, if tested, might\nestablish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatory\nevidence that must be turned over.\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, that certainly has\nbeen the position taken by the district attorney's\noffice in this case --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that consistent with\nArizona v. Youngblood?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I believe it -- it\nis consistent with Brady that if -- if one has a piece\nof evidence that can conclusively establish that the\ndefendant is innocent, that it can't be the law that the\nprosecutor can just put it in his hip pocket, not get it\ntested, and not turn it over to the defense, and not\nworry about whether they're prosecuting an innocent man.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, you see, it was\ntested. And it was made available to the defense.\nTurning over -- using the word \"turning over\" is\nridiculous, because they're not going to physically give\nit to the defense attorney to go off and do what he\nwants. They're going to give it to a lab that will\nestablish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera.\nSo it was made available. He went to look\nat it, but the looking at it wouldn't have told the\ndefense attorney anything. They had to make it\navailable for testing. He never asked for testing.\nThey did the lab reports. So now we come down to the\nonly failure is in the turning over of this report.\nCorrect?\nMR. COONEY: No, Your Honor. First of all,\nthere is -- there is a stipulation, stipulation L at\nJ.A. 14: Prior to the armed robbery trial, Mr.\nThompson and his attorneys were not advised of the\nexistence of the blood evidence, that the evidence had\nbeen tested, that a blood type was determined\ndefinitively --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, what did I just\nsay? The failure to turn over the report, correct?\nMR. COONEY: But -- but -- yes, Your Honor.\nBut what also is present here is the defense never had\nthe chance to -- never saw the physical blood evidence\nitself.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Never knew it existed?\nMR. COONEY: Never knew it existed, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's --\nMR. COONEY: There is testimony,\nclear testimony to that effect. If you look at Mr.\nWilliams's testimony in this case, there is a section of\nthe cross-examination where John Thompson's defense\ncounsel at the original criminal trial said just that.\nHe didn't know it existed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't -- it isn't\nclear from what -- according to what you said earlier,\nit isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from\nthe defense. It might have just been -- you said it was\nsent to the lab when -- when he came to look for it.\nMR. COONEY: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So would training have --\nhave gone into that detail? Don't send something to the\nlab when defense counsel is coming over to look for it.\nI mean, you know, that -- that's pretty detailed.\nMR. COONEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, but here\nthere's a stipulation that the crime lab report with the\nconclusive evidence about the perpetrator's blood\ntype was never --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but -- but that --\nMR. COONEY: -- ever provided.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the lab report.\nThat -- that's what Justice --\nMR. COONEY: And the physical evidence was\nnever seen, Your Honor, by defense counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For all we know, by\naccident, right? And the training would -- would\nprobably not have remedied that -- that difficulty.\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, four prosecutors --\nit is clear that four prosecutors knew about the\nexistence of blood evidence for months, and it was never\nproduced to the defense. And that blood evidence would\nhave conclusively established John Thompson's innocence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The defense was told to\ncome over and look for it -- to look at it. And when he\ncame over to look at it -- for all we know, by\naccident -- it was -- it had been sent to the lab.\nMR. COONEY: But -- but Your Honor, the \"it\"\nwas not come over and see the blood evidence. It was --\nthere was a broad request for -- for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand, but --\nyes. Okay.\nMR. COONEY: -- physical evidence at the\ncrime scene, including things that had nothing to do\nwith the blood. So there's nothing that the defense\nlawyer would have known by going to the evidence room to\nsay: I know there is nothing here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that --\nisn't that best practice? In other words, I thought\nthat was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does\nis say look at everything we've got. And as my brother\nhas suggested, what is important may not be there for\neither deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.\nMR. COONEY: But the point here, Your\nHonor -- and I think this goes to the causation point,\nthat -- that it would appear -- it would appear from\nlooking at Mr. Williams's testimony that there was a\ndeliberate effort to stay away from blood evidence in\nthe carjacking case. And Mr. Williams conceded that.\nSo this idea that this was an innocent error on the part\nof the prosecutors does not find support in the record.\nThe question is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it was willful --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that dooms your\ncase. If it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an\nintentional violation of Brady, there is no training\nthat was going to stop him from doing that.\nMR. COONEY: No, Your Honor, I think there\nis a difference between a tactical choice to do\nsomething sharp, on the one hand, and a knowing Brady\nviolation, on the other hand.\nAnd the jury could clearly conclude --\nparticularly because the 30(b)(6) witness in this office\ntestified that, in his view, it wasn't Brady material\nunless the -- unless the prosecutors knew John\nThompson's blood type -- the jury could clearly conclude\nthat what happened here was these four prosecutors\ndidn't understand and never got a clear message about --\nabout what Brady required, and they -- they did not\nproduce this evidence.\nThere is nothing that clearly showed that\nthey committed knowing Brady violations in this case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cooney, I'm still\nconfused as to sort of how much is enough by way of\ntraining and how you would ask a court or a jury to\ndecide that.\nYou suggested to the Chief Justice formal\ntraining wasn't -- isn't necessary if there's some\nsupervision, if there's some mentoring. But, you know,\nthis seems to give cities no sense of what they have to\ndo. No safe harbors. Is that your position?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think that Canton\narticulates a very flexible test. And I don't think\nCanton says there is one size that fits all. And I\nthink the protection that district attorney's offices\nget from Canton is from the standard of deliberate\nindifference.\nAnd if one looks at the 21 years of\nexperience under Canton, there have been between 6 and 8\ncases against prosecutors' offices under this kind of\ntheory, in total, where there was some payout from the\nprosecutors' offices to the defense. Total. In the 21\nyears.\nSo -- and the Court said -- this Court said\nin Canton, judge and jury doing their job are adequate\nto the test. I think we have been spending a lot of\ntime focusing on how much training. The fact is, this\nis a no-training case, where evidence that the -- that\nthe defendants now concede should have been produced\nwasn't produced, and four people knew about it and\nfailed to produce it.\nIn addition, there were multiple additional\npieces of Brady material in the murder case that weren't\nproduced. And this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would this have been\n-- would this be a no-training case if the rule was you\nhave to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair\nprosecutor before we let you have a case, and, in fact,\nyou have to be here 10 years before we let you have a\ncapital case? That's all it says. Is that sufficient\ntraining?\nMR. COONEY: I think, again, you would have\nto look at the circumstances of the office. I think\nwith this -- this presumption against disclosure that\nwas present in Connick's office, that takes this case\nout of the realm of the typical prosecutor's case,\nbecause it is a bare minimum disclosure rule.\nI think there needs to be -- if you're going\nto have that bare minimum disclosure rule, there needs\nto be something to counterbalance it. If you look at\nwhat the assistants testified to in this case, they all\nknew what not to produce. What they didn't know was\nwhat to produce.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what do you do with\nthe Dubelier testimony? Didn't he testify that it was\nstandard operating procedure to turn over all lab\nreports?\nMR. COONEY: Your Honor, I think there are\ntwo very quick answers to that. If one looks at J.A.\n550 to 551, which was Mr. Glas, the grand jury\nprosecutor's, testimony.\nWhat he clearly said was, during the grand\njury, when Mr. Connick decided to terminate the grand\njury, Mr. Connick and his first assistant were actually\narguing with Glas that if the prosecutors didn't know\nJohn Thompson's blood type, they didn't need to turn\nover the blood report.\nSo that's number one. I think there is an\nissue of fact that has to be resolved in our favor\nsolely from J.A. 550 and 551.\nAnd the second is, Your Honor, the -- the\nrule, the bare minimum discovery rule. Louisiana law\ndid not require the production of crime lab reports in\n1985.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Duncan, have you 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DUNCAN: Justice Alito and Justice\nKagan, you asked repeatedly questions designed to elicit\na response from my colleague: What would you tell a\nADAs with respect to training -- and I believe Justice\nSotomayor as well -- that would have prevented such a\nthing? And I didn't hear a clear answer.\nThe legal issue in this case turns on the\nfact that, in the deadly force scenario that Canton\nmarks out as the paradigm single-incident case, it is\nvery clear what a police office needs to tell a police\nofficer. Here's the deadly force standard under\nTennessee v. Garner: Don't shoot people unless there's\na reasonable probability of physical danger to yourself\nor to others. You've got to tell them that.\nWith respect to the Brady scenario, it's not\nclear at all. Yes, of course, training is useful. Yes,\nof course, training is important. But how do you\nconnect up a lack of specific training with a particular\nviolation that occurs?\nAnd having heard the argument, I'm -- I'm no\nlonger clear as to what the theory of the case of my\ncolleague's is about what caused the violation.\nWhatever caused the violation, I haven't heard about a\nspecific training measure that would have actually\nprevented what happened in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you train\nyour new hires? First day, somebody right out of law\nschool shows up and says, I want to be an assistant\ndistrict attorney. How do you train them?\nMR. COONEY: I think the first thing you do\nis you have a hiring process that emphasizes the\nimportant of -- the importance of Brady, as this office\ndid. Brady was important. One witness said --\nMcElroy -- from the moment you walked in the door, you\nhad to write an essay on Brady. Brady was emphasized as\nbeing very important. And then --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Duncan, that I think you\ncan't say, because that's just overturning what the jury\nfound.\nMR. DUNCAN: I -- I don't think -- the jury\ncouldn't have found that that didn't occur, Your Honor.\nThe jury found that that was inadequate.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The jury found that there\nwas inadequate training.\nMR. DUNCAN: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In fact, the jury found -- I\nthink, if you look at the record -- the jury could have\nfound, a reasonable jury could have found, that there\nwas no training here.\nMR. DUNCAN: A reasonable jury could have\nfound -- well, Your Honor, we don't contest the finding\nof inadequate training. What we contest is the\ningredients that lead -- that can lead to a deliberate\nindifference finding on the basis of inadequate\ntraining.\nAnd what we say is that this case, that is a\ngeneral case about you failed to train on Brady, it\ndoesn't fit within the single-incident hypothetical.\nAnd what I was trying to get at with -- with response to\nyour questions and Justice Alito's question was that, if\nyou can't say with any specificity, well, what training\ndo you give?\nYou asked repeatedly, Your Honor, how much\ntraining is enough? So is an hour a year? I thought I\nheard my colleague say that an hour a year may make this\nnot a no-training case, and so what you have there is a\npattern --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have to overturn the\njury finding?\nMR. DUNCAN: No, Your Honor. Absolutely\nnot.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We don't?\nMR. DUNCAN: No, you do not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because they found that the\nfailure to adequately train amounted to deliberate\nindifference to the fact that inaction would obviously\nresult in a constitutional violation. That's what they\nfound.\nNow, how can we -- assuming that's true and\naccepting it and not overturning it -- find that there\nwas something unlawful? Because you're arguing --\nyou're all arguing about whether the training program\nreally was adequate or not. They found it was not.\nWhat do we do?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer.\nMR. DUNCAN: Thank you, Your Honor, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nThe correct resolution is the lower court\nshould dismiss the failure-to-train claim as a matter of\nlaw because there was no demonstration of a pattern of\nviolations, and this situation does not fall within the\nnarrow range of circumstances that Canton foresees for\nsingle-incident liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
