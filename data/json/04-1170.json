        "content": "(11:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Kansas v. Marsh.\nGeneral Kline.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has never held that a specific\nstructure for weighing aggravating and mitigating\nfactors is required by the eighth amendment. Yet, this\nCourt has consistently held that all that is required\nby the eighth amendment is for States to afford an\nopportunity to jurors to consider all mitigating\nevidence relevant to determination of a sentence other\nthan death.\nThe Kansas statute, it is undisputed in this\ncase, allowed the respondent to introduce all such\nevidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, are\nspecifically instructed to consider all such mitigating\nevidence on an individualized basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: General, may -- may I -- I'd\nlike to pose a question which at least gets to the nub\nof the issue, as I see it, and -- and get your response\nto it.\nThe premise of my question is this. We -- we\ngenerally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life,\naggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a\ncase in which the -- the assumption is that they are\nevenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are\nexactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the\njury shall return the verdict of death.\nIf we are going to demand, as we have said\nthat we're going to demand, that the determination --\nthat the death penalty determination be one of\nwhat we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what\nhas to be supplied in order to make the Kansas\nprovision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it\nseems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other\nthings being equal, there is a presumption in favor of\ndeath.\nAnd my question is, am I correct in saying\nthat in order to hold your way, we have to hold that\nthe eighth amendment -- is consistent with the\neighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of\ndeath, other things being equal?\nMR. KLINE: As the Court -- yes. As the\nCourt has done in Walton, the standard in the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you agree that's --\nthat's a proper way to look at the issue then.\nMR. KLINE: Well, to take the issue in its\ntotal context and refer to the instructions and the\ntotality of what the jury is instructed, I would\ndisagree that there is a presumption of death --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then how do you get off the\ndime?\nMR. KLINE: The jury is given in the\ninstruction, instruction number 4 and instruction\nnumber 5, a direction as to the effect of their\nreasoned moral judgment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the\ndirection, as I understand it, is that if mitigation\nand aggravation are even, then the only way to come to\na conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because\nthe mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you\nshould return a verdict of death. And that seems to me\nanother way of saying there is a presumption that if\naggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty\nshould be death.\nMR. KLINE: Instruction number 5 does\ninstruct the juror, Justice Souter, that if the State\nmeets the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the mitigating factors do not outweigh the\naggravating factors, then the jury shall sentence the\ndefendant to death.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State has made a\njudgment that this particular offense -- what's it\ncalled? Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --\nMR. KLINE: First, they have to be convicted,\nJustice Scalia, of capital murder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Capital murder, as its name\nimplies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are\nmitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is\nnot proper.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a moral judgment,\nisn't it?\nMR. KLINE: That certainly is, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And even if the State had\nsaid the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State-\nprescribed moral judgment. If the State had said\ncapital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the\nmitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors,\nthat's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't\nit?\nMR. KLINE: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And can -- can you go back\nto Justice Souter's question for a minute? Because the\nway I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions\nthat I'd like you to make: first, that there could be\nsuch a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this\nis a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a\nsense. But I'll make the assumption there could be\nsuch a case. Second, I will assume that our case law\nleaves this open, a matter that can be argued.\nBut suppose that we do make that assumption\nfor the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this\nmade-up case is the case of the following. We have\naggravating factors and break them down into molecules\non a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here,\nthere is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the\njuror who is very conscientious ends up with the same\nnumber of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And\nin our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the\nsituation, you must say death.\nNow, if that's the case, how would you\nreconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that\nsays if you're going to sentence someone to death,\nthere has to be something special about his case that\nmeans it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case\nbecause, after all, for every molecule of specialness\nthat warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation\nthat doesn't?\nSo that's where I am, trying to get the cases\nout of it and trying to take very seriously the\nhypothetical that is before us.\nMR. KLINE: There -- thank you, Justice\nBreyer. There are several considerations and steps\nthat must be approached and proven by the State before\nwe get to that actual equation.\nFirst of all, the State follows the guided\ndiscretion standard of this Court, as laid out in\nFurman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of\nwhat capital murder is. In fact, the Kansas death\npenalty statute is one of the most narrow in the\nNation.\nAnd then past that point to the sentencing\njury, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at\nleast one of eight specific aggravating factors exist\nwith jury unanimity.\nAnd then past that point, Kansas has complied\nwith this Court's requirement under the eighth\namendment for a juror to consider and give effect to\nall mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other\nthan death and that instruction is specifically pointed\nout in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.\nFurthermore, the jurors are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman -- the --\nit's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, I\nknow. We ought to get that fixed.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman narrowing is\nproduced by the very first part of subsection (e). If,\nby a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances\nenumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments\nthereto exist -- that's the Furman.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then beyond that you say\nif that is found, then the jury has to find that the\nexistence of such aggravating does not outweigh.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct. And that --\nthat is how it complies with your hypothetical, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see, my\nhypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of\nthe cases. I have no doubt you can go through the\nlanguage and show that. And it's designed to say, but\nthe very point of those cases is you do not send\nsomeone to death unless the jury decides that the\ncircumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least\none molecule worth of worse, than the typical person.\nAnd given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how\nwe can say that, though I grant you, when you go back\nto those words in the cases, you're right.\nMR. KLINE: Well, the guided discretion of\nthis Court has indicated that the State must be able to\n-- and a juror -- differentiate between a defendant who\nis convicted of the same crime as to the -- and\nsentenced to life as the defendant who is sentenced to\nthe same crime and sentenced to death. And that is\nlaid out, as Justice Scalia pointed out, in the\ndefinition of capital murder and the requirement of\naggravated factors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the -- the\ninstructions don't tell the jury to weigh the\nmolecules. They tell the jury that the State has to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating\nmolecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how likely is it,\nif you have a jury who thinks the -- a juror, who\nthinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going\nto conclude that the State has carried its burden of\nproving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here\ndon't outweigh the 50 here?\nMR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a theoretical\nproposition --\nMR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, we are dealing\nwith a hypothetical that we believe does not exist in\njury deliberations. A juror steps back and decides\nwhether they can live with the decision that is before\nthem and then decides whether the death penalty is\nwarranted.\nAnd in fact, Kansas law leads them to that\nreasoned moral decision. In Kansas law, in instruction\nnumber 4, which again is laid out in your appendix,\ninstructs the juror that mercy, in and of itself, is\nsufficient to determine a sentence other than death.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask -- ask you\nthis. As a -- rather than presumptions, can we look at\nthis case as a matter of shifting burdens of proof? I\n-- I take it the Constitution does not require the\nState to introduce mitigating evidence. That's --\nthat's the responsibility of the accused.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so what we're saying\nhere is that when a State shows that the mitigators do\nnot outweigh the aggravators, then it's the\ndefendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show\nthat they do.\nMR. KLINE: Except -- you're correct, Justice\nKennedy, except that the burden on the State is beyond\na reasonable doubt to demonstrate that, the highest\nburden allowed by law. And beyond that burden that was\nin the Arizona statute, which was functionally\nidentical to the Kansas law, that was presented in this\n-- to this Court in Walton v. Arizona, and this Court\nrejected that very argument in that case. As you may\nrecall, the Arizona law was that there was a\nresponsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that\nmitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to\ncall for leniency. The Arizona Supreme Court had\ndecided that that meant that the mitigating factors\nmust outweigh the aggravating factors.\nAnd this Court accepted that case because of\na conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the\nKansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that\nthat was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth\namendment.\nThis Court resolved that conflict, and in\nfact, States relied on that resolution, as did the\nKansas legislature, in articulating the very standard\nexcept Kansas goes further and keeps the burden on the\nState.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. In Arizona, the\nburden was placed on the defendant, was it not --\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to -- to prove the\nmitigation? And yet, the Court upheld that even in the\nequipoise situation.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Over a dissent.\nMR. KLINE: Correct. Justice Blackmun's\ndissent.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So Kansas does not put the\nburden on the defendant.\nMR. KLINE: Not at any stage of the\nproceeding. The burden remains on the State to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I take it\nthe State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.\nMR. KLINE: It is incumbent upon the\ndefendant, Justice Kennedy, to bring forth factors in\nmitigation. The standard, though, in introduction is\nrelevancy, and Kansas has met the -- the requirements\nof this Court, as it relates to the specific sentencing\nor individualized sentencing structure, by allowing the\njury to consider all evidence relevant to the\ndetermination of a sentence other than death.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that means they\ncomply with Lockett.\nI want to ask you one question that goes back\nto your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice\nScalia. Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has\nmade a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the\ndeath penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed\nwith. And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and\n6. There were some State statutes that mandated death\nbased on the moral judgment of the State in certain\ncircumstances. I think one was a North Carolina\nstatute.\nDo you ask us to reexamine those cases?\nMR. KLINE: No, Justice Stevens. Actually\nthe State's position is consistent with the previous\ndecisions of this Court in this fashion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does not rely on\nthe proposition that there's a situation in which\nthere's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly\nokay.\nMR. KLINE: No, because there is a\nrequirement upon the State in the sentencing phase to\nprove factors in aggravation with jury unanimity beyond\na reasonable doubt that set aside this particular act\nin a different framework than those who commit capital\nmurder and are convicted of capital murder. If the\nState does not meet that burden --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but of course, the\naggravators -- it would be permissible for a State to\ninclude the aggravators necessary to narrow the category\nin the definition of the crime itself.\nMR. KLINE: This Court has held that it does.\nAnd Kansas has a very narrow death penalty in the\ndefinition of capital murder and also the specified\naggravators that the State must prove.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you would say that if\nthe State met that burden and there was no mitigating\nor no substantial mitigating evidence, it would be\npermissible to -- for the State to mandate the death\npenalty.\nMR. KLINE: Just as it is in Walton v.\nArizona.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes.\nMR. KLINE: Yes. The answer is yes, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you think that's fully\nconsistent with the North Carolina case.\nMR. KLINE: It is not fully consistent, I\ndon't believe. It is consistent with the Walton case\nin that this Court said a mandatory death penalty is\nnot unconstitutional, as long as the State\ndifferentiates between those convicted of the same\ncrime and who are sentenced to life and those who are\nconvicted of the same crime and sentenced to death.\nKansas clearly does that in the requirement that the\nState prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of at\nleast eight specific statutory aggravating factors\nexist in the case.\nBut Kansas goes further. Unlike in Walton v.\nArizona, the burden remains on the State to also prove\nthat the mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant\nwho has the lowest threshold allowed by law, and all\nthat is required by this Court -- that is relevancy --\nthat all of that evidence does not outweigh --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it -- that's the way\nJustice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but the\nmajority didn't quite say that because it said the\nburden on the defendant was to prove sufficient\nmitigation to justify something other than the death\npenalty. And conceivably one could have met that\nburden with substantial mitigating evidence that came\nout even.\nMR. KLINE: Well, the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under the majority's\nopinion -- now, you're dead right about what Justice\nBlackmun said, but --\nMR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, you are correct.\nThe majority didn't specifically address that, but\nthey also analyzed the case, much as Justice Kennedy\njust did, in saying that really what we're talking\nabout is whether the State eventually at some point,\nonce it has met the requirement of the individualized\nsentencing requirements of this Court, can say that\ndeath is appropriate. And the answer in this Court's\njurisprudence has been clearly yes once we are able to\nset aside this defendant from other defendants\nconvicted of the same crime.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree that it\nwould be consistent with the -- the text of the\nmajority opinion to say it really meant they have to\nprove enough mitigating evidence to make death the\ninappropriate sentence, which could be less than --\neven a 50/50 balance?\nMR. KLINE: Arguably, yes, Justice Stevens.\nAnd that is the language of the Arizona statute, but it\nwould fly in the face of the interpretation of the\nArizona Supreme Court, as well as the Ninth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals in Adamson v. Ricketts which,\nsubsequent to the Walton decision, held that Walton\ncontrolled and allowed the potentiality of equipoise to\nbe constitutional.\nNow, one thing I would like to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address\nthe other questions? I think we added a question\nabout whether the Kansas Supreme Court's judgment was\nadequately supported by an independent State ground.\nAnd I'm not sure that this has been adequately\naddressed.\nDo we have jurisdiction here? The -- the\nKansas Supreme Court vacated the capital murder\njudgment and remanded it and said it would have done it\nanyway because of the State law evidentiary error\nconcerning admission of third party guilt evidence. So\ndoes that independent ground mean we don't have\njurisdiction here on this thing?\nMR. KLINE: No, Justice O'Connor, there is\nnot an independent and adequate State ground for this\ndecision. It is undisputed that the Kansas Supreme\nCourt relies on this Court's interpretation of the\neighth amendment for the interpretation of the cruel or\nunusual punishment clause of the Kansas constitution.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there was another\nground.\nMR. KLINE: Yes, but it is not adequate and\nindependent. The argument of the respondent is that\nthe constitutional savings doctrine and severability\narguments are independent and adequate, and by their\nvery nature, they are dependent rather than\nindependent.\nThe Kansas Supreme Court engaged in a -- and\nI quote from the decision -- a full reexamination of\nthe eighth amendment jurisprudence in coming to the\nconclusion in paragraph 25 of the syllabus, which is\nthe law of the case in Kansas under Kansas law, that\nthe Kansas death penalty statute is unconstitutional on\nits face. That was the first such holding in Kansas\njurisprudence history finding that determination.\nPreviously, 3 years earlier, the court had\nfound the death penalty statute constitutional as\nconstrued, and as this Court knows, you will not accept\njurisdiction of a State court's interpretation or\nconstruction of a State law. So, therefore, this is\nthe first opportunity that the State has had and I\nwould say the last.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but was this -- was\nthis case remanded for a new trial?\nMR. KLINE: It is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And presumably, if there\nis a conviction and a sentence, you could come back\nhere again by way of a cross appeal.\nMR. KLINE: That would be incorrect, Justice\nO'Connor. Kansas is prohibited. The prosecutors are\nprohibited and limited of the right of appeal in Kansas\nlaw as in most States.\nAnd -- and this Court had a similar case in\nNeville v. South Dakota in which you construed South\nDakota law as it relates to limiting the prosecution's\nability to appeal and, through that construction,\nidentified in an interlocutory basis, when the lower\ncourt passes on a constitutional measure that has\nimport for this Court, that the inability of the State\nto be able to pursue that case renders jurisdiction\nunder 28, section 1257. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If I -- if I understand\nwhat the situation is, there is no death penalty in\nKansas as a result of this decision.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. There is no death penalty. The highest\ncourt of our State has spoken and stricken it down as\nunconstitutional on its face.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there been any\nmovement in the legislature to change the law so you\nwon't be in this situation where there is no death\npenalty?\nMR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, there's\nsignificant discussion in the legislature, but that\ndiscussion is somewhat mixed, as you might imagine, and\nsome were concerned that action might moot this case.\nRight now there are 12 pending capital murder cases in\nKansas which, if this Court does not reverse the Kansas\nSupreme Court, the State will not be able to seek\ncapital murder charges and the death sentence in those\ncases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that wouldn't be true\nif you amended the statute though, would it? If you -- if\nthey amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out\nof it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult,\nyou could still impose the death penalty on these other\n12 people who haven't been tried.\nMR. KLINE: It is our position, Justice\nStevens, since their crimes were committed prior to any\nact of the legislature, we would be prohibited from\nseeking the death penalty.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because of an ameliorating\namendment to the death penalty statute?\nMR. KLINE: That is -- that is our -- our\nposition. It would have to take an entire --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I doubt if you'd take that\nposition if they did it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KLINE: Well, Justice Stevens, if you put\nme in that position, I will be an advocate for the\nState.\nHowever, it is our position, as Justice\nGinsburg alluded to, that the State has no death\npenalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the\ndeath penalty for the State to have one.\nAnd that is borne out in case law. There is\nno uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the\nState to seek appeal in charging death once there is no\ndeath statute that is available. The references in\nKansas law to KSA section 22-3602(b) are a very settled\narea of the law. The respondent argues that subsection\n(1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to\npreserve this issue below. However, that only relates\nto the State being able to appeal charging documents,\nand the definitions of those documents are very\nspecific in Kansas law.\nFurthermore, subsection (3) states that a\nprosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very\nclear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court\nsees that issue as important for the administration of\njustice, the uniform administration of justice, in the\nState, and has interpreted that to mean only where\nguidance of the supreme court is necessary. It is not\na method for moving for rehearing. The Kansas Supreme\nCourt rejects that. We moved for reconsideration and\nreconsideration was not granted.\nIf this Court embarks, as the respondent asks\nit to, it will put in jeopardy 12 capital murder cases\nand prevent 12 capital murder cases from being pursued\nin Kansas. It will effectively strike down the laws of\nseven other States that have functionally identical\nstatutes as Kansas.\nAnd furthermore, it would effectively call\ninto question the laws of five other States that do not\neven require any weighing mechanism whatsoever. This\nCourt has never gone further and required a specific\nmechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances and has relegated that duty, as it\nshould, to the States as long as the juror has the\nopportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based\non the consideration of all mitigating evidence\nrelevant to a decision other than death that relates to\nthe character, the background of the defendant, or the\ncircumstances of the offense.\nAnd if you would look in your joint appendix\non pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that\nthe State of Kansas gave in this case, and it is\nundisputed that the respondent's presentation of\nmitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full,\nand additionally, the jury was specifically instructed\nto consider and give weight -- I'm sorry. It's pages\n24 and 25 -- specifically instructed to give weight to\nall of that evidence. Pages 24 and 25. I am referring\nto instruction number 4. And you will see the\ndelineation beginning on page 25 of all the mitigating\nevidence that was admitted as relevant in this case.\nAnd I would also say that Kansas continues to\nbear a greater burden in its consideration -- for the\njuror's consideration in that the juror is instructed\non paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of\nitself is sufficient -- is sufficient -- to outweigh\nthe aggravating evidence presented by the State. So\ncontrary to the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have no idea what that\nmeans. I mean, you -- you go into this very elaborate\nsystem, you know, molecules on one side, molecules on\nthe other.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then you throw the whole\nthing up in the air and say mercy alone is enough. I\nmean --\nMR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, I think it is --\nit is default for a life sentence. And I believe it\nis certainly an acknowledgement that what really\nhappens here is a juror steps back, after the\nconsideration of all the evidence that this Court\nrequires under the eighth amendment, and decides what\nthey can live with: a sentence of death or a sentence\nof life. And one juror who has doubt can extend mercy.\nAnd, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the\nCourt, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMs. Woodman, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. WOODMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to devote the bulk of my time to\nanswering the State's arguments on the merits because\nthe constitutional issue presented by the Kansas\ncapital sentencing statute is actually quite different\nthan the State and its amici would have it appear.\nTheir arguments rest on an erroneous assumption about\nthe way the statute operates and the real issues that\nits operation raises.\nUnder the Kansas formula, prosecutors can and\ndo urge jurors not to persevere in their decision-\nmaking if they are undecided regarding the balance of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances. In other\nwords, if the decision is too hard to make, the\nsentence must be death. The formula --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it reasonable\nto suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard\nto decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side\nand 50 on the other? In other words, it would seem to\nme that that's an easy case to say that the State has\nnot met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the mitigating factors don't outweigh the\naggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.\nMS. WOODMAN: No, Your Honor. I think that\nit's not right to think of this in terms of\nmathematical formulas, molecules on one side or the\nother. This is a subjective, qualitative determination\nthat the jury makes, and whatever capital sentencing\nstatute a State chooses, States are free to choose\nwhatever structure they see fit to determine whether\ndeath is an appropriate sentence. However, States are\nnot free to enact a statute that doesn't ensure a\nreliable determination that death is an appropriate\nsentence, and that's what we're dealing with here.\nIt's a qualitative judgment and one can imagine, very\neasily I think, a scenario where jurors are\ndeliberating. They take their jobs very seriously and\nthey cannot make a determination whether aggravators\noutweigh mitigators, or vice versa.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the\ndefendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of\nmitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come\nforward with it.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, in -- in a situation of\nequipoise, by which I mean a state of indecision on\nwhether the relative balance between aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances, burden of proof is not the\nsticking point there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's a state\nof indecision. The jury has decided that aggravating\nfactors have been established.\nMS. WOODMAN: But that -- that's -- that's\nthe problem because that's not a reliable\ndetermination. It's no determination that based upon\nthe individual --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it a reliable\ndetermination that, number one, it's a death-qualified\naccused in -- in any event, and there have been\nspecific aggravators proved? That has been determined.\nIt's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that\nthe mitigating circumstances outweigh this. The -- and\nyou have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the mitigators have not\noutweighed the aggravators.\nMS. WOODMAN: But the jury is specifically\ninstructed under this formula that they have a third\noption, and that is where they can't make a decision,\nwhether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They have made the\ndecision. They have made the decision that the\naggravators are there and have not been outweighed.\nThey have made that decision.\nMS. WOODMAN: But the jury is required to\nimpose death at that point, and it is a decision that\naggravators are not outweighed by mitigators. But this\nCourt's eighth amendment jurisprudence requires --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's because the\nmitigation case hasn't been made.\nMS. WOODMAN: The eighth amendment requires\njurors to make a determination, based upon individual\ncharacteristics, whether death is an appropriate\nsentence, whether the defendant deserves death. And\nwhen the jury is in a situation of equipoise and is\nrequired to impose death, they're imposing death\nwithout having made that determination that death is an\nappropriate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're -- they're\nsaying it is appropriate. They're saying it is\nappropriate. We have the people put in the box. The\nbox is are they in a situation that is different from\nthe average murderer. Yes. And they're making the\ndetermination that although they're in that box, that\nmorally they're no different. Morally they're the same\n--\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, there's no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because for every factor\nthat makes them morally one way, there's a factor that\nmakes them morally the other way. So they're\ndifferent, but they're not morally different.\nNow, that's -- that's what I think this case\npresents. And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's\nthinking just what I said. I don't know if there ever\nwas such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the\nstatute in this instant tells him what to do.\nMS. WOODMAN: The statute does tell them what\nto do. It tells --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says where you think\nthere is an equivalent, but not a moral difference,\ndeath.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, but if -- if you think --\nif you look at the prosecutorial arguments, for\nexample, that have been made in both the Kleypas and\nMarsh cases, those prosecutorial arguments have urged\nthe jurors to do exactly what I described, and that is\nto abdicate their decision to make a -- a determination\nbased on the -- on individual characteristics on\nthe question of whether death is an appropriate\npunishment for this individual offender based on the\nspecific circumstances of this crime, and that if\nthey're in equipoise, they have to impose a death\nsentence. That is encouraging the jurors to abdicate\ntheir decision to determine whether death is an\nappropriate sentence or not.\nThen --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you\nknow, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with --\nwith most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but --\nbut what I have really always thought it demanded was\nreally nothing more precise than that a jury has to be\ngiven the opportunity to grant mercy. I -- I'm not\nsure I would describe any of it as any more precise\nthan that.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The jury has to be given the\nopportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the\ndeath penalty. However you want to put that, you know,\nyou can put the burdens here, the burdens there. You\ncan talk about equipoise or not. Does the jury have a\nchance to say this -- this fellow does not deserve the\ndeath penalty? That --\nMS. WOODMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and clearly exists\nunder this scheme, it seems to me. Any jury that --\nthat really thinks this person should not go to death\ncan -- can do it. In fact, you know, I guess the\nstatute does not demand that instruction, but that\ninstruction that says -- what is it? The\nappropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be\na mitigating factor. I mean, gee, what -- what else --\nwhat else do you have to do?\nMS. WOODMAN: But that's one factor among\nmany that the jury has to consider. And the problem\nhere is that the jury could have all of the information\nthat a defendant has proffered as a basis for a\nsentence less than death, and a jury could still be\nunable to decide whether aggravation or mitigation is\nthe weightier in a closely balanced case. And that is\nthe problem here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any jury that thought this\n-- this person did not deserve death would have ample\nopportunity to give expression to that determination\nunder this scheme.\nMS. WOODMAN: Only if they persevere in that\ndecision-making, and prosecutors urge them not to by\ntelling them that they must impose death when they\ncannot decide the balance between aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Woodman, you said that\nthey didn't make such an argument in this case and in\nsome other case, but you did not include the argument\nin the joint appendix, did you?\nMS. WOODMAN: No, I did -- we did not include\nthe prosecutorial closing arguments. They are in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you -- the\n-- the argument --\nMS. WOODMAN: They are in the brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a brief from the\nKansas law professors, and this is the instruction from\nthe Kleypas case?\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the aggravators are not\noutweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose the\ndeath penalty, not that you may, not that you can, but\nthat you shall impose the death penalty. This is the\nduty you were sworn to uphold. Shows command. It\nmeans must. That's -- is that the type of instruction\n--\nMS. WOODMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the type of argument?\nMS. WOODMAN: That's correct, and then in Mr.\nMarsh's case, which is part of the record in this case\n-- and I've cited to the record for that argument,\nwhich is at -- I apologize. It's at volume 54 at pages\n54 and 55 of the record of the Kansas Supreme Court in\nthe Marsh case. And in that case, the prosecutorial\narguments told the jury that they can't even consider\nmitigating evidence unless they find that mitigating\ncircumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances\nbecause the law has told you and the judge has told you\nthat the law says that if the aggravating circumstances\nare not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, you\nshall return a verdict of death.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore, they\nshouldn't consider mitigating at all, he told them?\nMS. WOODMAN: No. This is not a question of\nnot being able to consider mitigating circumstances.\nAnd as I said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is this mercy\ninstruction always given? Is that standard? Is it --\nis it, in effect, that -- that mercy is -- is always\none of the mitigating circumstances?\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes. That's part of the jury\ninstructions in capital cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I -- I really don't see\nwhat -- what complaint you have then. Any jury that --\nthat thinks this person deserves mercy says, I think he\ndeserves mercy, and that's -- that's a -- a mitigating\ncircumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating\ncircumstances there are.\nMS. WOODMAN: But when you think about the\ndifficulty of the individualized sentencing decision\nthat the jury has to make, the -- one juror might feel\nthat way, but it's only if they persevere in that\ndecisionmaking. This statutory equipoise provision\nencourages jurors not to persevere in their\ndecisionmaking. They're -- they're sitting around in\nthe jury room. One juror --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the\nstatutory equipoise provision?\nMS. WOODMAN: It says that if the jury finds\nthe existence of at least one aggravating factor and\ndetermines further that any aggravating circumstances\nthat exist are not outweighed by any mitigating\ncircumstances found to exist, the sentence shall be\ndeath.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's my\nquestion. There is no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the State is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no statutory\nequipoise provision. The State has a burden of proof\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating\nfactors don't outweigh the aggravating. That's what\nyou mean by the statutory equipoise provision?\nMS. WOODMAN: The statutory equipoise\nprovision, as the Kansas Supreme Court found -- they\nconstrued this statute. They construed it to mean that\nit requires death when jurors are undecided about the\nbalance between aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances. That construction of the statute is\nentitled to respect. And under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who said that? Excuse me.\nThat -- that description of the statute.\nMS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court in the\nKleypas case in holding it unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it seems to me the\nstatute doesn't really say that, does it? But I mean,\nwhat the statute says is that if it's in perfect\nequipoise, the State loses because the State has the\nburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the --\nthat the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators.\nIt seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect\nequipoise, the jury would have to say the State has not\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do\nnot outweigh the aggravators. What -- isn't that what a\njury would have to say?\nMS. WOODMAN: No. Under the statute, the\nState's burden of proof, which is beyond a reasonable\ndoubt -- I'll grant that, but it's to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the aggravators are not\noutweighed by the mitigators.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. Okay. And --\nand if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators\nare outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect\nequipoise, who loses?\nMS. WOODMAN: The defendant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. The State loses. It's\nthe State that has the burden of proving beyond a\nreasonable doubt that they are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the Kansas Supreme\nCourt thought that --\nMS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court\nconstrued it to mean that a tie goes to the -- to the\nState.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's different from saying\nnot decided. I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't\nspeak of not decided. I thought it didn't speak in\nKleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up\nits -- his mind. I thought it said the jury has made\n-- it assumed the juror has made up his mind. That's\nwhy I think it's artificial. It says where the jury\nfinds. It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and\naggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has\nto find that.\nMS. WOODMAN: But this is not about\nstructuring decisionmaking. This is about terminating\ndecisionmaking on the issue that is central to the\neighth amendment requirements at the selection stage --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's terminating it\nbecause there's not enough mitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true I -- I think,\nisn't it?\nAnd then the question is, does a State have a\nright not to do with burden of proof, not to do with\nanything else, but to have perhaps the artificial\nsituation where the jury finds that the evidence is in\nequipoise whoever has the burden of proof. Put it all\non you, whoever had it. That was their final\nconclusion. I find it is in equipoise.\nNext question: what happens?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, the statute hasn't\nassigned a burden of proof, but still that's not the\nproblem here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I agree with you.\nThat's not the problem.\nMS. WOODMAN: Because what the\nindividualization requirement means, in this Court's\nown jurisprudence, is that mere consideration of\nmitigating circumstances is not enough. The Court said\nso in Tennard and in many other cases, Penry v.\nJohnson, that it's not enough that the sentencer be\nallowed to consider mitigating circumstances. It must\nbe allowed to consider and give effect to those\nmitigating circumstances.\nAnd when a jury cannot decide between\naggravating and mitigating circumstances, when that\njury is, nevertheless, required under this -- that\nsituation to impose a sentence of death, the sentence\nof death has been imposed without the jury having made\nthe requisite individualized sentencing decision under\nthe eighth amendment at the selection stage.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I might point out -- I just\nlooked at the question presented. It does assume --\nand I guess is drafted by the Kansas Attorney General.\nThe question is what happens when mitigating and\naggravating evidence is in equipoise. So the\nassumption on which we took the case is that there will\nbe cases in which there's equipoise.\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right. And the Kansas\nSupreme Court found that that was a real possibility.\nAnd the Kansas Supreme Court found this statute\nunconstitutional in Kleypas because it violates the\nindividualized sentencing requirement, and the court\nspecifically found that it requires death when jurors\nare unable to decide the balance between aggravating\nand mitigating circumstances. That's how the statute\nwas construed in Kleypas.\nI would like to address the jurisdictional\nissue for a few moments, unless there are any further\nquestions from the Court on the equipoise issue, which\nI'd be happy to answer. But one of the things I want\nto discuss today is the jurisdictional issue on the\nadequate and independent State law ground, which this\nCourt asked the parties to brief.\nI feel that the State misstates the issue\nthere as well because in the Kansas Supreme Court, the\nState conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the\nKansas equipoise formula, as decided by the court in\nthe Kleypas case 4 years ago, and defended in this case\nonly on the contested State law ground of severability\nand bypassed raising a Federal question in a motion for\na rehearing, which again relied solely on State law\nseverability grounds.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the Attorney\nGeneral said that the -- the fact that in this\nparticular case the issue was focused on, in effect,\nsort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent\nupon the assumption about what Federal law required.\nIt was dependent upon the earlier case which so held.\nSo I don't -- and -- and what he seem -- says seems\nplausible to me. I -- I don't see how we can divorce\nthe judgment here with the earlier judgment, which\nKansas -- which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon\nhere, which was a Federal ground.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, it's clear that the\nKansas Supreme Court's decision relies on severability\nas a basis for its decision, and it's true that the\nKansas Supreme Court, in doing so, reiterated the\nKleypas holding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't have even raised\nthe issue had it not been for the earlier Federal\nholding. Isn't that correct?\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right, but Mr. Marsh\nraised the issue on State law severability grounds.\nThe State conceded that Mr. Marsh was entitled to have\nhis death sentence vacated because of the\nunconstitutional equipoise provision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you -- I\n-- I take it this is the implication of your position.\nDo you take this position that in any instance in\nwhich a State supreme court decides a case on a Federal\n-- decides an issue on a Federal ground in case A, and\nfor whatever reason, case A is not brought to this\nCourt for review, that in every subsequent case in the\nState system, which depends upon State A, the State is\ntotally without the -- or this Court is -- is totally\nwithout jurisdiction to review it?\nMS. WOODMAN: Where the issue has not been\npressed by a party in the State court, no, I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how could the issue be\npressed? I mean, it had already been decided by the\nsupreme court. I mean, what -- what could the State\nsay to the trial court?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, we asked the court to\noverrule the severability decision in Kleypas. There\nwas absolutely nothing preventing the State from\narguing that the constitutional decision in Kleypas\nshould be overruled. Absolutely nothing preventing\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think this -- you think\nthe State has to challenge as unconstitutional a\ndecision of the State supreme court in -- in the lower\ncourt, lower State court.\nMS. WOODMAN: I think that they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you expect the lower\nState court to come out on that?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, but futility is never a\nreason for not raising an issue. Criminal defendants\nare required to raise issues all the time in order to\npreserve them for later review. In Engle v. Isaacs,\nthis -- this Court said futility is no excuse. And\nwhat is good for criminal defendants, very\nrespectfully, is good for the State. And Justice\nRehnquist said as much for the Court in the Court's\ndecision in Illinois v. Gates, that -- that States are\nnot exempt from the ordinary rules of procedure which\ngovern this Court's jurisdiction.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that the State\nnot only did not raise the Federal issue in the Kansas\nSupreme Court below, which it could have, but it\nconceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a little different\nfrom an adequate and independent State ground argument.\nYou're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, there's a -- there's a\nrelationship between the adequate and independent State\nlaw cases and the not pressed or passed upon cases\nbecause, for example, in Michigan v. Long, this Court\nhas said where an issue is pressed -- a Federal issue\nis pressed in the State courts, then this Court on\nreview will resolve any ambiguity in the Court's\nopinion in favor of a presumption that the issue was\npassed upon by the State court.\nBut conversely, in Coleman v. Thompson, this\nCourt held that where an issue is not pressed in the\nState courts, then the presumption will be the\nopposite. The presumption will be that the State court\nhas not passed upon --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't need a\npresumption here. I mean, the -- the only basis for\ninquiring into severability is the presumed\nunconstitutionality of the statute. I mean, that's the\nonly basis why severability comes up. We don't have to\npresume anything.\nMS. WOODMAN: But the Kansas Supreme Court\ndidn't redecide that issue in the Marsh case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter whether it\nredecided it. It -- it was the postulate of -- of its\n-- necessary postulate of -- of its decision in this\ncase, it seems to me.\nMS. WOODMAN: There -- well, under article\nIII and under section 1257(a), there has to be a case\nor controversy for this Court to review. There was no\nlive case or controversy in the Kansas Supreme Court on\nthe Federal question of whether the equipoise provision\nin the Kansas statute was constitutional. It was\nconceded that it was unconstitutional and the parties\nagreed on that. It was treated as settled. And all\nthe Kansas Supreme Court did, before overruling the\nKleypas severability decision, which is a matter of\nState law, was to reiterate that holding, and mere\nreiteration, as this Court knows from the Morrison v.\nWatson case, approved in Illinois v. Gates, that is not\nthe decision of a Federal question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you're -- if you're\nright, I take it, we would not have jurisdiction to\nreview a Federal ground that was raised by a State\ncourt, even though it had not been raised by the\nparties. If they get -- you know, they get the opinion\nfrom the court and there's a big surprise -- the -- the\nState court decided to go off on -- on a Federal\nground, which had not been pressed -- I take it on your\nview we would not have jurisdiction to review that.\nMS. WOODMAN: I don't believe the Court\nwould, and I think that's what the Court's original\njurisdictional rules were intended to be.\nNow, I do understand that the Court has taken\njurisdiction over such issues, and it's usually --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nthe -- the formula is that the issue has to either have\nbeen raised or decided.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, the only issue that I\ncould find that says that -- that really enforces that\nrule is the Cohen v. Cowles Media case. And if you\nlook at the provenance of that decision, that's the\nonly case where the Court actually considered a\nquestion for the first time in -- in this Court. And\nwhat happened in that case is that the Federal issue\nthat was presented to this Court was actually discussed\nat oral argument. It wasn't raised by either of the\nparties in their briefs in the State court, but it was\ndiscussed at oral argument. And the Court decided a\nfirst amendment issue on the basis of that discussion\nat oral argument. And so this Court took jurisdiction\nand stated that as long as it's been passed upon, it's\nnot necessary that it was pressed upon.\nAnd the decision, which the Court relied on\nin that case is, if I'm remembering it correctly, was a\ndecision involving a Federal question which was raised\ntoo late to comply with the procedural requirements in\nState court. And so it's really not the case that this\nCourt routinely takes cases where the issue was not\npressed by the parties in the State courts. And that's\nthe situation we have in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't -- I\ndon't -- excuse me. I don't understand how that makes\nany sense. If you had an -- a -- a case that's\nlitigated entirely on State law grounds and in the\nState supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua\nsponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal\nConstitution and you, State, lose, your argument is\nthat State is just out of luck. They can't seek\nreview of that decision?\nMS. WOODMAN: I think where the issue is\ndecided sua sponte and affects the parties in that\ncase, then maybe.\nBut that didn't happen here. What happened\nhere was that the court merely reiterated a holding\nfrom 4 years ago, and the State law severability\ndecision, which was the issue in contest in this case\nand the issue that was decided in this case, the\nmatter of State law, and it was sufficient to support\nthe judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court.\nAnd really, what -- what the State is trying\nto do here is to -- I mean, these issues were decided\nin the Kleypas case, and if we were here on the Kleypas\ncase, there wouldn't be any argument as to whether the\nKansas Supreme Court's decision rested on an adequate\nand independent State law ground because the Federal\nissue was clearly decided and it was interwoven with\nthe State law determination. But that's not the case\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Kleypas didn't hold that the\nwhole statute was bad. Kleypas gave a savings\nconstruction of the statute, as I recall.\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes, they did. But the State\nis misconstruing their decision by saying they didn't\ndecide the constitutional question in Kleypas. It was\nmerely construction of the statute to avoid the\nconstitutional issue and therefore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in the case\nbefore us, the court -- the Kansas court said -- I\nthink it's 24 or 25 of the -- of the headnote -- we are\nreconsidering the issue.\nMS. WOODMAN: The -- that language in the\ncourt's opinion was, after full reconsideration, we're\ndeclining to revisit the issue at the dissenter's\ninvitation. We're declining that invitation to revisit\nthe issue.\nAnd there's no question that the court\ndiscussed it and thought about it, and the dissenters\nwere clearly inviting them --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And made a reasoned\njudgment about it.\nMS. WOODMAN: But they didn't reopen the\nissue. They said there's nothing new here. We don't\nneed to reopen this decision, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they reopened it to\nthe extent as Justice Scalia has indicated, but they\nnow take a different view of the validity of the State\nstatute.\nMS. WOODMAN: They're taking a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- that's a decision\nfollowing a reason, and the reason is a Federal reason.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, no, because the -- what\nthey were saying was that the appropriate remedy in\nKleypas was to return the subject to the legislature\nbecause the statute was ambiguous and the court had no\nauthority, under separation of powers grounds and under\nState law statutory interpretation grounds, to construe\nthis statute to mean the opposite of what it said. And\nthat's the decision that they overruled in this case,\nand that's a State law decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the State can get\nmouse-trapped in this way. In -- in the first case, it\ndoesn't take the case up because not too much has been\nlost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh,\nby the way, everything has been lost. And you say that\nwe can't review that because -- because the -- the\nState didn't -- didn't challenge Kleypas at the time.\nMS. WOODMAN: Or challenge that decision in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that decision in\nthis -- they had no reason to challenge it until the\nState decided to -- to change it.\nMS. WOODMAN: But if they wanted to raise the\nissue, they could have raised it in either case, and we\nwouldn't have this problem here. But they didn't raise\nit, and that presents a jurisdictional problem for this\nCourt.\nWhat they're trying to do in this case is\nyoke a live horse to a dead one to form a plowing team,\nand it doesn't work.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I like that.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. WOODMAN: I looked -- as a matter of\nfact, I looked at our Kansas State seal because it has\na plowing -- a horse-drawn plow on it, and I looked at\nit again this morning before I came in here because I\ncouldn't remember whether it was one horse or two, and\nit's two horses. And I was thinking about how the\nmeaning of that State seal would be fundamentally\naltered if one of those horses was dead.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. WOODMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nWoodman.\nGeneral Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe State is here on a final court decision\nwrongfully -- the State supreme court wrongfully\ninterpreting this Court's eighth amendment\njurisprudence. And just as Justice Souter and the\nChief Justice's hypotheticals, as it relates to this\ncase, were articulated, it is actually true that in\nthis case the State was not aware that this issue would\nbe raised again and only conceded -- and waiver is\ntruly not an issue because a lower court did not rely\nupon it. And we have some confusion between the terms\nhere. It only conceded that Kleypas, a decision by the\nKansas Supreme Court, was the law of the case in\nanother case subsequently reaching the Kansas Supreme\nCourt. And the Kansas Supreme Court, on its own\nmotion, engaged in a full reconsideration and the\nrespondent in their brief argues that the primary\nreliance of the court was not on eighth amendment\njurisprudence but other grounds.\nThere is no requirement for jurisdiction\nunder 28-1257 that the primary reliance be on a Federal\nissue. There is a requirement to deny jurisdiction\nthat there be an independent and adequate State ground\non which the decision would rest regardless of the\noutcome of the Federal issue. Clearly that's not the\ncase here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't they have come out\nthe same way if they never mentioned the Federal issue?\nMR. KLINE: This case come out -- no, it\nwould not because the Kleypas court found that the\nKansas -- or the Kansas death penalty was\nconstitutional as construed. And the Kansas court in\nthis case found it unconstitutional on its face. And\nthere is a significant difference, and the court raised\nthe issue again.\nI would like to point out to the Court that\nthere are five ways that a juror can, after their\nreasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that\nthe mitigating evidence does not warrant the death\npenalty.\nThe juror can state that they have a\nreasonable doubt as to whether the State has met its\nburden of proving that the mitigating factors do not\noutweigh the aggravating factors.\nThe juror can simply delay. Kansas law has a\ndefect -- default for life in its sentence or in its\nstructure, and I would encourage you to read on page 28\nof your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury\nis told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable\nto make a decision -- in other words, in a doubtful\ncase -- the judge is required by law to dismiss the\njury and sentence the defendant to life. And so there\nis a default for life, and that is another way that a\njuror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision\nthat death is not appropriate.\nThe juror can give effect to their reasoned\nmoral decision that is not appropriate by determining\nthat the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating\nfactors. And the juror under instruction number 5 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it cannot do that by\ndetermining that they're in equipoise.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is the very issue\nyour -- your petition presents us with.\nMR. KLINE: It is, but the juror does know\nwhat the effect of that decision is and, therefore, is\nable to engage in a reasoned moral choice.\nWhat truly happens -- and -- and Justice\nBreyer alluded to it, I believe, as it relates to this\nhypothetical about weighing molecules -- is that a\njuror essentially steps back and decides what is the\nappropriate sentence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, do it. Do it.\nMake the reasoned moral choice. And the facts are that\nwe have, because of the balancing, molecules or not --\nwe have by the balancing made a determination that\nanything for the bad that distinguishes this person\nfrom the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the\ngood. Now, make the moral choice.\nMR. KLINE: I think the moral --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason?\nMR. KLINE: I think the moral decision,\nJustice Breyer, is determined in all the variables of\nthe introduction of the evidence, and as this Court has\nrequired under the eighth amendment, that it allow the\njury to consider and give effect to all mitigating\nevidence relevant. And that's in Kansas law.\nI would state this in closing, and that is\nthat the Kansas legislature reenacted the death penalty\nfor the first time since this Court struck it down in\nFurman in the spring of 1994. And in doing so, it gave\ngreat deference to this Court's role as final arbiter\nof the meaning of the Constitution. And if you read\nthe instructions and the law that is provided to you in\nthis case, you will see this Court's words mirrored\nback to you in the scheme of the Kansas law as it\nrelates to the death penalty.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nKline.\n"
