        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-973, the United States v. Alphonso Vonn.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent pleaded guilty with counsel by his\nside after having been advised at least twice earlier in\nthe proceedings of his right to the assistance of counsel\nat all stages of the proceedings. The court of appeals,\nnevertheless, set aside his guilty plea on the ground that\nthe district court, during the guilty plea colloquy, had\nfailed to advise respondent of his right to the assistance\nof counsel as required by rule 11(c)(3) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure.\nThe court of appeals decision is wrong for three\nreasons.\nFirst, the court of appeals erred by applying a\nharmless error rather than a plain error standard of\nreview to the district court's violation of rule 11.\nRespondent had not objected in the trial court to the rule\n11 error, and therefore the standard of review is that for\nclaims which were not preserved below, rather than claims\nthat were.\nSecond, the Ninth Circuit applied an incorrect\nstandard for determining whether a rule 11 error affects\nsubstantial rights within the meaning of the harmless\nerror and plain error rules. The Ninth Circuit was of the\nview that unless the defendant could be shown to have\nknowledge of the precise aspect of rule 11, that the\ndistrict court had failed to inform the defendant about\nthe guilty plea must be set aside. The correct standard\nunder this Court's cases is whether the error had an\neffect on the outcome of the proceeding, which in this\ncase means whether the error had an effect on respondent's\nwillingness to enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea.\nAnd finally, the Ninth Circuit erred by\nconfining its analysis of whether the error in this case\nwarranted reversal to the record of the guilty plea\ncolloquy itself, failing to look at other portions of the\nofficial record that illuminated whether the defendant\nactually had knowledge of the information that the\ndistrict judge had failed to provide to him. In this\ncase, the district court, through its magistrate judges,\nhad advised respondent, both at the initial appearance\nafter respondent was arrested and at the arraignment after\nrespondent was indicted, of his right to counsel at all\nstages of the proceeding. Respondent executed a waiver of\nrights form in which he acknowledged receiving and\nunderstanding these rights, and the district magistrate\njudge asked respondent at the arraignment whether he\nunderstood these rights. If the court of appeals had\nlooked to the entire record to determine whether the rule\n11 error in this case warranted reversal, it would have\nconcluded, even under its own standards, applying harmless\nerror review and asking whether the respondent knew the\ninformation that he had not been told during the rule 11\ncolloquy, that respondent, indeed, did have that\ninformation and, therefore, entered a valid guilty plea.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben?\nQUESTION: I'm not sure how your points two and\nthree quite fit together. Your point two is that you look\nat -- to see the outcome of the proceeding, would it have\nbeen different? But then your point three is that you\nshould confine yourself just to the record. If your -- if\nyour point two is whether or not, you know, all the\ncircumstances -- this was a wise plea that he would have\n-- that he would have entered -- it seems to me you might\nbe going outside the record in order to determine that.\nAnd I -- and I have some question about your point two,\nanyway. I think it goes too far.\nMR. DREEBEN: Our second argument is that the\nproper inquiry into whether an error affects substantial\nrights is whether there is an effect on the outcome of the\nproceeding. And in this case, the relevant proceeding to\nlook to is the guilty plea itself. Now, a court of\nappeals, in determining whether that standard is met, must\nof course look at the record.\nThe difference between the position of the\nUnited States and the position of the court of appeals is\nthat the court of appeals says the only record that's\nrelevant is the rule 11 guilty plea colloquy itself.\nNothing else matters.\nQUESTION: That -- that I understand. But if\nyou're going to -- if your -- if your test under two is\nwhether or not he would have entered the plea, it seems to\nme that that's a difficult inquiry to make if you confine\nyourself just to the record even if it's the whole record\nand not just the rule 11 colloquy plea itself.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it is -- it's a difficult\ninquiry to make if there is no information in the record\nthat sheds light on it, and in that instance, the party\nthat bears the burden of proof will probably lose, which\nis why it matters whether the standard is plain error\nreview, in which the defendant bears the burden of proof,\nor harmless error review, in which case the Government\nbears the burden of proof.\nBut in this case, the claim of the rule 11 error\nis that the defendant didn't get, at his guilty plea\ncolloquy, information that he had the right to counsel at\nevery stage of the proceeding. Since the record shows\nthat the defendant, in fact, got that information, not\nonce but at least twice, at earlier stages of the\nproceeding, and he had counsel by his side when he pleaded\nguilty, not once but twice, it is untenable on this record\nto suggest that the guilty plea would have come out any\ndifferently if the judge had complied with rule 11 in\nevery relevant respect.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, if we answer what is\nyour second question in your petition, not as outlined\nthis morning, the second question being, do you look to\nthe entire record or just the rule 11 colloquy, if we\nanswer that question in your favor, look to the entire\nrecord, is it necessary to get into the two anterior\nquestions that you outline, that is plain error versus\nharmless error, and this one that troubled Justice Kennedy\nthat you don't list as a question in your cert petition?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I believe the\nCourt can reverse the judgment based solely on a favorable\nresolution for the Government of the third question\npresented it; that is, if the Court does look to the\nentire record in this case, then I believe that the Ninth\nCircuit's judgment is incorrect even if it were correct on\nthe other two points that I've outlined.\nBut there is a conflict in the circuits over the\nquestion of whether harmless error review or plain error\nreview does apply in these circumstances, and the\nGovernment sought review on that issue in order to have\nthis Court resolve the conflict.\nQUESTION: But if the -- if that is an academic\nquestion -- that is, if you could argue, as I think you\ndo, if you look at the whole record -- then it doesn't\nmatter what standard you apply, harmless error, plain\nerror. It's clear that this defendant was advised of his\nright to counsel at every stage of the proceeding.\nMR. DREEBEN: That is true, and the Court could\nresolve the case solely on that basis. If it did so, it\nwould leave unarticulated in this Court's jurisprudence\nthe precise approach that lower courts should take when\nrule 11 errors occur.\nQUESTION: Well, alternatively we -- we could\nresolve it just on the basis of your third point. I mean,\nwouldn't that be just as conclusive, just say the usual\nplain error rule applies. The burden was -- was on the\ndefendant to establish, and even if you limit the\nexamination just to the colloquy, he hasn't -- he hasn't\nestablished it.\nMR. DREEBEN: That would be a resolution on what\nI think is the first question that we present in the\npetition.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. Maybe I got your numbers\nwrong.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: But -- but we can certainly resolve\nit on several of the questions without resolving the other\nones.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's certainly possible to do\nthat.\nThe second question, which we did not present\nseparately, but I believe is fairly included within our\nfirst question, the definition of what is an effect on\nsubstantial rights for purposes of a rule 11 error, is a\nquestion that the Court doesn't need to resolve in this\ncase, but it is an important analytical tool for\nunderstanding what lower courts should do when confronted\nwith rule 11 errors. And therefore this Court's guidance\non it would be useful.\nQUESTION: Which is more important? I mean, if\n-- if we're going to be very parsimonious and -- and not\ndecide any more issues than we have to, which -- which is\n-- does the Government think is the more important issue\nin the case?\nMR. DREEBEN: The two that we presented I think\nare both equally important. The question whether plain\nerror or harmless error review applies and the question of\nwhat record the court of appeals should look to in\ndeciding --\nQUESTION: Is there a conflict on the latter as\nwell?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is a conflict on the latter\nas well.\nQUESTION: Any court, other than this one, come\nout this way?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. I believe that the Ninth\nCircuit is the only court of appeals that has limited the\n-- the review solely to the guilty plea transcript.\nThe advisory committee notes to rule 11 make\nclear that the harmless error rule that was added to rule\n11 in 1983, rule 11(h), was to be applied based on the\nguilty plea record and the rest of the necessarily limited\nrecord that is made in guilty plea cases. But that record\nwill include, as it did here, the initial appearance, the\narraignment. Sometimes there will be multiple hearings on\nwhether the defendant wishes to change his plea to a plea\nof guilty. Admissions may be made during the course of\nthose hearings. And, of course, there is a sentencing\nhearing. And during the sentencing hearing, the defendant\nmay provide -- be provided with the information that was\nleft out inadvertently of the rule 11 colloquy, and he may\nat that time either reaffirm his interest in pleading\nguilty or show no surprise at the information that is\nprovided to him or otherwise make it clear that this rule\n11 error had no effect on substantial --\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nQUESTION: Why does it make any difference? The\n-- the plain versus the harmless? My only problem is I\nforesee writing more words. When I write words on this\nkind of subject, I worry that I would risk mixing\neverybody up in the courts of appeals, to tell you the\ntruth. There's already -- there's been a lot written\nabout plain error, substantial error, harmless error. Why\nnot just stick with what we've said? How does it make any\ndifference? Why should we write some new words?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Government doesn't ask the --\nthe Court to write new words. Rather, we ask the Court to\napply its existing plain error standards. Under the plain\nerror review that this Court has articulated and, indeed,\nunder harmless error review, the meaning of an effect on\nsubstantial rights is defined by its effect on the outcome\nin the generality of cases.\nQUESTION: Right. So, the -- we don't have to\ntalk about plain error or harmless error. The only\ndifference here, nobody doubts that if it was an error,\nwhich it was, or that it was plain, which it was, the\nissue in this case is whether it affected somebody's\nsubstantial rights. Period.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there are two competing\ndefinitions that are proposed for the Court on what an\neffect on substantial rights is.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy's question\nsuggested that there may be some reason to --\nQUESTION: Fine. That's my -- that's -- you've\ngot exactly what I'm concerned about. We should write a\nparagraph or two about substantial rights, what is an\neffect on substantial rights. Other than that, there is\nno need to discuss plain error versus harmless error. Is\nthat right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I certainly agree\nand I agreed with other questions that suggest that there\nis a very straightforward, simple resolution of this case\nthat would involve making very little law. It would make\nclear that courts are to look to the whole record, and it\nwould then leave unresolved the circuit conflict on plain\nerror versus harmless error.\nBut the fact is that there are differences\nbetween plain error and harmless error review that will\nmatter in a certain class of cases. One difference\nbetween plain error and harmless error review is the one\nI've mentioned, that the defendant bears the burden of\nproof if it's plain error; we bear the burden of proof if\nit's harmless error.\nThe other difference is that even if an error\ndoes affect substantial rights, under plain error review,\na judgment is not to be reversed unless there is an impact\non the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, one of the advantages --\nI don't know if it's a sufficient advantage of Judge\nKozinski's position is a simple -- very simple job for the\ncourt of appeals: either they got the advice or they\ndidn't during the hearing. How does the Government say\nthe court of appeals should dispose of a case in which the\nrecord shows that an arraignment 3 or 4 months before the\nguilty plea colloquy, the defendant's lawyer says I've\nadvised him about his right to counsel at trial? He tells\nhim that at the arraignment. The record shows that. And\nthen that's all it shows. Then you have the guilty plea\ncolloquy. And -- and the judge fails to comply with the\nrule. What should you do with that case?\nMR. DREEBEN: The court of appeals should affirm\nbecause there is ample evidence that the defendant had\nknowledge of the particular right in question that he\nclaims was not given to him at the rule 11 colloquy.\nQUESTION: There's an irrebuttable presumption\nthat he fully understood it 3 months later.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. There's not an irrebuttable\npresumption. If there were something in the record that\nindicated --\nQUESTION: No, nothing else in the record.\nMR. DREEBEN: If there is nothing else in the\nrecord, then I think that there's nothing to rebut the\npresumption.\nThis Court has indicated in a number of contexts\nthat information that a defendant has been given at one\nstage of a proceeding -- give rise to a presumption that\nthe defendant has knowledge of it. For example, the\ndefendant is indicted and read the indictment at an\narraignment. This Court made clear in Bousley v. United\nStates that there's a presumption that the defendant has\nbeen given adequate notice of the charge. Now, that\npresumption can be overcome later in the proceedings if\nthe judge gives the defendant misinformation about the\ncharge or if the defendant otherwise can show from the\nrecord that he didn't have an adequate understanding of\nthe charge.\nQUESTION: Well, what about this record where\nthe defendant said a couple of times, I don't understand\nwhat this lawyer is talking about and this is my first\ntime in -- in the criminal process? He was, as you said,\ntold twice and signed a piece of paper that said counsel\nat every stage of the proceeding, but the defendant also\nsaid that he didn't -- he didn't understand what was going\non. He didn't understand what his counsel was telling\nhim.\nMR. DREEBEN: He said that the first time that\nhe wanted to enter a guilty plea and the district judge\nrecessed the proceedings for a week to give the lawyer an\nadditional chance to explain to the defendant what was\ngoing on. He said, take a week. It's not going to cost\nyou anything. You'll get credit for the time. You have a\ngood lawyer. He can explain it to you. And the defendant\nsaid, yes, Your Honor, I acknowledge that.\nA week went by, and the defendant came back into\ncourt, with the advice of counsel, counsel by his side,\nand pleaded guilty to one of the two counts that were\npending against him. The other count was continued on for\ntrial.\nSeveral other proceedings occurred while that\nsecond count remained pending, in which the parties\nobtained continuances for trial because counsel was\nunavailable. All of this time, the respondent is in the\ncourtroom, hearing this information, being made aware that\nhe has a lawyer, that his lawyer is with him and his\nlawyer is going to be with him at trial.\nNow, it is true that when the time came for the\nultimate guilty plea, the judge didn't enumerate the\ndefendant's right to counsel at trial. And in fact, when\nthe Government tried to alert the district court that it\nhadn't mentioned the right to counsel, the court said, I\ndidn't alert him to that because he already has counsel.\nAnd no one stood up at any point, neither the defendant --\nQUESTION: But you agree the court did violate\nthe rule at that point.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. The court clearly violated\nthe rule because rule 11 is a prophylactic rule that\nsweeps more broadly than the Constitution. It contains a\nspecific enumeration of rights. It contains those rights\nthat this Court identified in Boykin v. Alabama, as --\nQUESTION: The problem with your solution is\nsuggested -- suggested by Justice Stevens' question. My\nunderstanding -- it's anecdotal but it's longstanding --\nis that judges are very careful about rule 11 proceedings.\nThey go through it point by point with painstaking care,\nand judges talk to each other about the right way to do\nit. And, sure, we could write an opinion, now this is the\ngood practice, you should really follow the rule very\nstrictly, but if you don't, it doesn't make any\ndifference. It seems to me that adoption of your position\nwill inevitably change the seriousness and the formality\nof rule 11 proceedings as it now exists. I think that is\ninevitable.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that that's a\nnecessary consequence of a ruling in our favor, Justice\nKennedy. First of all, all of the court of appeals apply\nsome form of harmless error or plain error review. The\nNinth Circuit is in the minority in applying the most\nrestrictive form. All of the other courts, though,\ncurrently imply something. And that doesn't detract --\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you place any reliance\non the amendment to the rule in 1983 to add subsection\n(h), which says any variance from the procedures required\nby this rule, meaning rule 11, which does not affect\nsubstantial rights, shall be disregarded. Is that\napplicable here in your view?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is -- it is applicable if the\nCourt concludes that plain error review does not apply.\nOur first submission is that because this was a defaulted\nnot raised below, it can be considered by the court of\nappeals only under rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of --\nQUESTION: Okay. May -- may I ask you a\nquestion? You pointed out -- I guess it's no question --\nthat subsection (h) was added, in effect, to negate the --\nthe automatic reversal rule that -- that had prevailed\nbeforehand. If that was the only thing that was intended\nby (h), why didn't the drafters of subsection (h) include\nboth the kind of standard language for plain error -- I'm\nsorry -- the standard language for harmless error as they\ndid and the standard language for plain error, which would\nclearly have indicated that one or the other of those\nalternatives would apply, as it would, otherwise in the\nnormal course elsewhere? Why did they just pick one?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I believe that the\nreason that the drafters picked just one is that the\ndrafters were addressing a specific holding of this Court\nthat, as Justice O'Connor indicated, had suggested that\nthere was automatic reversal in the case of a rule 11\nviolation. And the drafters wanted to negate that\nspecific holding. The rule --\nQUESTION: But the cleanest way to negate it\nwould be to simply say, you engage in some kind of an\nanalysis of consequences. You either do it in terms of --\nof harmless error or you do it in in terms of plain error.\nThat would have accomplished the object and it would have\nmade it abundantly clear that your position is correct by\n-- by -- and I just don't -- I just don't understand why\nthey omitted the one.\nMR. DREEBEN: The drafters weren't thinking of\nthis issue. What they were thinking about was\nspecifically negating McCarthy. They also wanted to make\nit clear -- and they did make clear in the advisory\ncommittee notes -- that the addition of rule 11(h) to rule\n11 was not intended to have a negative inference that\nviolations of other rules should give rise to per se\nreversal. Rule 52 would remain in place for all of those\nother errors involving other rules.\nQUESTION: But you could -- you could certainly\naccept the position that -- that there would not be a per\nse reversal under another rule without also accepting the\nposition that 52(b) would still apply.\nMR. DREEBEN: You could. I believe that there's\na general presumption in the Federal criminal system that\nif an error is preserved at trial, it's subject to\nharmless error review, which is what rule 11(h) provides\nfor. If an error is not preserved at trial, it's subject\nto review only under the plain error rule, rule 52(b), and\nthis --\nQUESTION: 11(h) is addressed to the district\ncourt too, and the -- you're talking about what should the\nstandard be in the court of appeals. But there are other\nFederal rules. That's a common formula that's addressed\nto the district judge saying, disregard trial errors that\ndon't have any substantial effect. Whatever those words\nare in 11 are both in the civil rules and the criminal\nrules in other places.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right, and rule 52 is also\naddressed to the district court. Rule 52 is found in the\nRules of Criminal Procedure, not in the Rules of Appellate\nProcedure. So, it instructs both district courts, court\nof appeals, and this Court to disregard errors that did\nnot affect substantial rights and give the district court,\nthe court of appeals, and this Court power to set aside\njudgments where the error was not called to the attention\nof the district court but the error constitutes plain\nerror.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, I -- I have a\nperplexity. You -- you said counsel -- appointed counsel\nwas present when -- when the erroneous instruction was\ngiven but didn't object?\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. There was a -- an\nattempt by the Government --\nQUESTION: I understand that, but the rule reads\nif the defendant is not represented by an attorney, that\nthe defendant has the right to be represented by an\nattorney at every stage of the proceeding and, if\nnecessary, one will be appointed to represent the\ndefendant.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's rule 11(c)(2). The\nviolation in this case was of rule 11(c)(3), which\nenumerates for the defendant the various rights, not a\ncomplete list, but a partial list of rights that the\ndefendant has at the trial.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. DREEBEN: And those rights --\nQUESTION: And that one is applicable whether or\nnot he's represented.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. That -- that rule is a\nresponse to this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama\nwhich held that if the record is entirely silent on\nwhether the defendant entered a knowing and intelligent\nplea, a court of appeals on direct review cannot uphold\nit.\nAnd in response to Boykin, the drafters of the\nrules wanted to provide a prophylactic buffer to make sure\nthat there could be no valid claims, either on direct\nappeal or on collateral review, that the defendant pleaded\nguilty without a sufficient understanding of the rights\nthat he would have at trial if he had gone to trial. So,\n11(c)(3) walks through the right to counsel, the right to\nconfront witnesses, the right to self-incrimination, and\nthe right to a jury trial. And then it goes on in\n11(c)(4) and says, by pleading guilty, you waive your\nright to a trial.\nQUESTION: Would -- would you be taking the same\nposition regarding plain error review if what were at\nissue was (c)(2) rather than (c)(3)?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but it would be an almost\nimpossible burden --\nQUESTION: It would be harder.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- for the Government to satisfy.\nQUESTION: Because (c)(2) envisions a situation\nin which there's nobody to make the objection.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right.\nQUESTION: And (c)(3), well, doesn't always\nenvision a situation in which counsel is present, does it?\nMR. DREEBEN: Actually I want to revise the\nanswer. I think that it would be very hard for us to win\nif the advice required under (c)(2) were not given and the\ndefendant were not represented by counsel.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: But not because only counsel can\nmake an objection. If a defendant validly waives the\nright to counsel, under Faretta v. California, and he's\ngiven an adequate colloquy, and he's told of the risks and\ndisadvantages, and he's told by the judge, look, you're\nnot a lawyer. It's going to be difficult for you to do\nthis. If you want to go forward, please understand I'm\nnot going to help you out in this. You're on your own,\nand the rules of procedure are complicated. They usually\nfinish up by saying, so if it's up to me, I wouldn't do\nit, but if you want to do it, it's your choice.\nIf the defendant goes through that and he elects\nto go without counsel, he's subject to all the same\nprocedural rules that anybody else is, and it's true that\nhe won't probably do a very good job at protecting his own\nrights, but once he decides to act as his own counsel,\nhe's not given a free pass to escape from those rights.\nNow, if the judge doesn't give the advice\nrequired by 11(c)(2) and we can't show that he has gone\nthrough a thorough and adequate Faretta colloquy elsewhere\nin the proceedings, then I suspect we're going to lose\nthat case because a felony trial without counsel is one of\nthe few errors that gives rise to a per se presumption of\nprejudice without any further showing, and it would be\nalmost impossible for us to show or for the defendant to\nfail to show that he's entitled to plead anew.\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nQUESTION: Can we go back to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion? That is, taking your position, there is really\nno muscle behind the instruction to the district judge:\nYou give each one of these warnings. If you could say he\ngot those warnings at the arraignment, he got them even\nearlier, he signed a card, so it doesn't matter because\nhe's going to know by the time you get to the rule 11,\nthen what sanction is there to say to a judge, look, don't\nskip any of these, just go down the list?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think, Justice\nGinsburg, that the Court should frame a rule to provide a\nsanction. All of the parties to rule 11 fully understand\nthat it should be complied with. The Federal Judicial\nCenter has a bench book. We come to court often with\nchecklists to assist the court. Defense counsel has that\nresponsibility. And judges conscientiously try to do\nthis.\nQUESTION: This isn't much of a sanction on the\njudge anyway. He's not the prosecutor. He's not supposed\nto care whether this guy gets convicted or not, is he?\nMR. DREEBEN: The ultimate sanction would fall\non society if --\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question, Mr.\nDreeben? The -- when the McCarthy was decided, there was\na big conflict in the -- all the courts of appeals about\nshould be done in cases like this. And one of the\nconsiderations that motivated the McCarthy opinion was\navoiding an evidentiary hearing if the record is ambiguous\non appeal. It figured that simplicity is desirable.\nIn your reading of the rule, would there be\ncases in which the record was not entirely clear before\nthe court of appeals and that there would have to be a\nremand for an evidentiary hearing?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Stevens, because\nwhoever bore the burden of proof on appeal is going to\nhave to make that showing based on the existing record,\nand if the Government bears the burden and it can't\nestablish harmlessness, then the court of appeals should\nvacate the plea. If the defendant bears the burden and he\ncan't show it, he loses. There will be an opportunity to\nmake a constitutional claim under 2255, but this isn't an\nendless remand.\nQUESTION: The burden of proof you're talking\nabout then is not actually an evidentiary burden. It's\nthe burden that the court of appeals judges the case by.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. That's correct.\nQUESTION: And there never would be a case in\nyour view for -- for more evidence.\nMR. DREEBEN: I wouldn't say never and I\nwouldn't exclude the possibility that a district court --\nthat a court of appeals had discretion, but it -- it's not\nthe normal procedure. And if you look around --\nQUESTION: Of course, violations of the rule are\nnot the normal procedure either. They're very -- quite\nrare.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, with 60,000 Federal criminal\nconvictions each year, even a very low error rate is going\nto produce a large number of cases. And there are a large\nnumber of rule 11 cases that come to the court of appeals\nwhere there really is no substantial doubt that the\ndefendant had all the information and counsel to plead\nguilty. Now, he could make an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim if he really felt he was missing something\nso that his plea wasn't intelligent.\nBut the purpose of rule 11 was not to create a\nregime in which guilty pleas were upset for minor\ndeviations from the rule. That was exactly what --\nQUESTION: This is not a minor deviation. This\nis not a minor deviation.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think this is a minor deviation,\nJustice Stevens, because this defendant had been told\nabout this right.\nQUESTION: Well, assume that he hadn't been\ntold, then it would be a major deviation.\nMR. DREEBEN: And he had counsel. And I also\nthink that almost any defendant who pleads guilty in an\nAmerican court with counsel will have had a discussion\nwith counsel about the option of going to trial, which\nwould include counsel --\nQUESTION: Well, if he has counsel at\narraignment and at a plea and so forth, surely he must\nrealize he's going to get counsel at the trial.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's virtually inevitable that it\nwill be. And this was not a right that this Court had\nenumerated in Boykin v. Alabama was one of the rights that\nthe defendant should be advised about.\nQUESTION: Okay, but we can't -- we can't start\n-- I don't think, we can start making distinctions within\nthe -- the rule 11 list among the rights that are supposed\nto be advised. I mean, if it's on the list, I assume it's\ngot to get equal treatment with any other right that's on\nthe list, even though, I'm sure you're -- you're correct,\nin most cases, the defendant with counsel is going to know\nhe's got a right to counsel, which means, if you follow\nthe -- the harmless rule, the Government is going to have\nan easy time meeting its burden.\nMR. DREEBEN: He -- he should know that, and\nrule 11 should be complied with. But I do not believe\nthat there is a court of appeals case that reverses a\nconviction for failure to give this advice to a counseled\ndefendant.\nIf I could save the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben.\nMs. Knox, we'll from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MONICA KNOX\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. KNOX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly held that pleas of\nguilty will not lightly be set aside when they are\ncarefully and lawfully taken. The premise behind cases\nfrom Brady and McMann to Bousley and Hyde is that pleas\nare taken with care and discernment befitting the grave\nand solemn act that they are.\nThe Government today proffers rules that would\nallow pleas to be taken in almost meaningless formality,\ntaken in casual and sloppy proceedings with omissions,\nvariances, and errors which could not be remedied. That\nis not what the advisory committee did in rule 11. It is\nnot what this Court has supposed in refusing to set aside\npleas later, and in some circumstances, it is not\nconsistent with the Constitution.\nOur position is that plain error is never\napplicable to review of a rule 11 violation on direct\nappeal, and that a rule 11 variance, which goes directly\nto the voluntariness or intelligence of the plea is always\nprejudicial unless the record of the plea colloquy shows\nthat the requirements for an intelligent and voluntary\nplea were met.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the reasoning behind --\nyou say your position is that plain error is never\napplicable. Now, what is your -- what's the reason you\nsay that?\nMS. KNOX: Well, the initial starting place is\nwhat the advisory committee did. What the advisory\ncommittee did was to seek to abrogate the per se rule of\nMcCarthy by adding (h) into rule 11. When the advisory\ncommittee did that, it specifically noted that the class\nof rule 11 violations that would be considered harmless on\nappeal would be very limited.\nBy the Government's rules and if plain error\nwere to apply, the class of errors that would be\nconsidered harmless on appeal would be almost\nunencumbered. It would be --\nQUESTION: Well -- well, in this -- in this\ncase, if we do look to the entire record and if we do\nlearn that this defendant was advised that he had a right\nto an attorney if he went to trial at the trial and had\nacknowledged that understanding, then why is it not one of\nthese insubstantial errors contemplated by subsection (h)?\nMS. KNOX: Well, it is a substantial error in\nthat it is one of the core concerns of rule 11. If the\nrecord --\nQUESTION: But if -- if it shows that the\ndefendant, in fact, knew, what's the problem?\nMS. KNOX: If the record, in fact, shows that\nthe defendant had the knowledge he needs to render an\nintelligent plea, I would agree that that would be\nharmless error. The advisory committee did not anticipate\ngoing outside the rule 11 colloquy for that determination,\nand there are legitimate reasons for that. The issue of\nwhether a plea --\nQUESTION: Why didn't they say that? Why didn't\nthey say that?\nQUESTION: Is there anything in rule 11 itself\nthat says you cannot look beyond the transcript of the\nplea hearing itself?\nMS. KNOX: Specifically there is nothing --\nQUESTION: No.\nMS. KNOX: -- in rule 11 that says you cannot do\nthat.\nAt the time that -- in 1974 when the advisory\ncommittee added subsection (g), having to do with taking a\ncomplete -- making a complete record of the rule 11\ncolloquy, though, the advisory committee did specifically\nsay that they were doing that in order to facilitate the\nreviews of plea challenges later. And that -- they were\nreferring at that point to the transcript of the plea\ncolloquy.\nThe important point here, I think, is that a\nplea has to be an intelligent plea at the time it is\ngiven. When Mr. Vonn made his plea, he needed to know of\nthe constitutional rights he was giving up by agreeing to\nforego a trial at that time.\nQUESTION: Well, you speak as if it was a\nrecipe, you know. You have to put all these ingredients\nin at exactly the same time. But I don't think that makes\nmuch sense. If he -- supposing the arraignment had been a\nweek earlier and he'd been told then and signed this\nwaiver of rights, would you say that it couldn't be\npossible that he would remember them for a week?\nMS. KNOX: No. Of course, he could remember\nthem for a week if they were meaningfully given to him to\nstart with.\nOne of the things I think is important for the\nCourt to focus on is what other proceedings we are going\nto look at, if we're going to go outside the plea\ncolloquy, to decide whether a defendant has this knowledge\nor not. What the Government has asked this Court to allow\nis the circuits to look at appearances such as the initial\nappearance and the post-indictment arraignment. Those\nproceedings are -- at least in our district and in many\ndistricts, they are mass proceedings. These are not\nindividual rights given to individual defendants. There\nis no personal colloquy between the court and the\ndefendant. There is no attempt to make sure that the\ndefendant actually understands these rights and the\nmeanings of these rights.\nQUESTION: Ms. Knox, when you say they're\nmass --\nQUESTION: This the arraignment or the -- just\none moment. This is the arraignment you talked about, not\nthe sentencing. The sentencing --\nMS. KNOX: Not the sentencing.\nQUESTION: Okay, thank you.\nMS. KNOX: We're talking about the initial --\nQUESTION: You're talking about two -- two pre-\nguilty pleas, the arraignment and when the initial\ncomplaint was made. You say they were mass proceedings.\nDoes this record tell us how many defendants were being\narraigned?\nMS. KNOX: The record does not show how many\ndefendants were being arraigned in this case, no.\nQUESTION: But -- and at the arraignment at\nleast at that stage, a lawyer had already been appointed,\nand wasn't it true that the lawyer was with the client at\nthe arraignment?\nMS. KNOX: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that, in addition to the oral\nwarning in the courtroom, there was a document that had a\nrather simple paragraph, unusually plain English for --\nfor lawyers and judges. And that was signed by the\nclient, or at least to the extent he could sign since he\nhad a broken arm, and it was undersigned by the lawyer.\nSo, that wasn't a mass exercise. That was the client\nsigning a document and his lawyer undersigning and the\nlawyer saying I represent that my client understands these\nrights.\nMS. KNOX: That's right, and we also have a\nclient who repeatedly told the court that he wasn't\nunderstanding what his attorney was telling him. And so,\nwe have -- you can have no confidence on this record that\nMr. Vonn understood his constitutional rights because he\nwas handed a piece of paper that he put his X on. Yes, he\nhad counsel with him and his counsel said he understands\nthese. But Mr. Vonn himself was telling the court that he\nwasn't understanding the proceedings. He wasn't\nunderstanding what his attorney was telling him.\nThis Court has --\nQUESTION: Well, all -- all this goes to the\nquestion of -- of what would -- will happen, if we get to\nthat point, on -- on remand for consideration of a broader\nrecord if we rule against you on that. But what does it\nhave to do with the question whether the -- the trial\ncourt should look beyond the four corners? It simply\nmeans that in some cases it won't be easy to decide, but\nis -- is that much of an objection?\nMS. KNOX: Well, I think it means in many cases\nit may not be easy to decide. One of the --\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is your -- your basic\npoint is that Congress intended just to streamline these\nproceedings and it simply didn't want courts have -- to\nhave to get into difficult evidentiary issues and that's\nwhy we should hold that they look no further than the four\ncorners?\nMS. KNOX: Well, that is always one of the\nadvantage of prophylactic rules is to prevent that later\ntype of fact finding.\nQUESTION: But this prophylactic rule doesn't\nsay what you want us to do. I mean, that's the problem I\nhave. If that's what Congress wanted, why didn't they say\nit?\nI mean, they have subsection (g) which -- which\nis entitled Record of Proceedings. A verbatim record of\nthe proceedings at which a defendant enters a plea shall\nbe made, and if there is a plea of guilty or nolo, the\nrecord shall include blah, blah, blah, blah. It could\nhave been very easy to say, and such record -- such\nverbatim record shall be the exclusive basis on which the\n-- any review of -- of the proceeding is conducted.\nMS. KNOX: There was no reason, in 1974 when the\nadvisory committee added (g) to the rule, to say that\nspecifically.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMS. KNOX: Because it was --\nQUESTION: The usual rule is you look to the\nwhole record.\nMS. KNOX: Because it was the rule of McCarthy.\nMcCarthy was the law in 1974 when (g) was added to the\nrecord, and it was -- so there was no need for the\nadvisory committee to put in there that it was being --\nthat appellate review would be restricted.\nQUESTION: Well -- wait, wait. McCarthy didn't\nrequire looking to the record at all for any harmless\nerror. McCarthy said, no harmless error. If you didn't\ngive the instruction, that's it. McCarthy certainly\ndidn't say that in determining whether there's harmless\nerror or not, you only look to the record of the\nproceeding. It never reached that issue.\nMS. KNOX: No, but McCarthy determined the issue\nof whether there was rule 11 error by looking only at the\nrule 11 colloquy. That's important in terms of the\nconstitutional rights because under Boykin, those have to\nbe established on the record at the time.\nQUESTION: But the Government is not proposing\nto change that -- that McCarthy rule. The Government\nwould still look only to the proceedings of -- of the\ncolloquy in determining whether there was rule 11 error,\nwhich is what McCarthy did. You only look to that to\ndetermine whether there was error.\nBut we now have a totally different question\nwhich is, assuming there is error and assuming there is a\nharmless error exception to reversal, what do you look to?\nSimply the whole record which is what usually is done, or\nfor some special reason, should we limit it just to this\nproceeding? And I -- I think if it's -- we're going to be\nso limited, it should have said so, especially when there\nis a section entitled Record of Proceedings.\nI mean, all of this is only relevant if we first\nconcede a point that -- that you -- that you do not\nconcede, and that is if there is any such thing as\nharmless error. But assuming there is such a thing as\nharmless error, why -- on what basis in these rules could\nwe limit our inquiry just to the -- to the plea colloquy?\nI don't -- I don't see any basis for that.\nMS. KNOX: Other than the policy reason that\nwe've discussed, as well as what my argument as to what\nthe advisory committee meant when it put both (g)and (h)\ninto the rule, I don't have another reason that the Court\nshould do it.\nQUESTION: Well, Ms. Knox, I -- as I -- as I\nread the advisory committee notes when they added\nsubsection (h), I thought the note stated that harmless\nerror review should be resolved solely on the basis of the\nrule 11 transcript and the other portions of the limited\nrecord made in such cases. It clearly contemplated\nlooking beyond the transcript.\nMS. KNOX: I think it contemplated looking at\nthe transcript with certain rule 11 violations.\nThis morning we have been discussing rule 11 as\nif all provisions of it are equal, and I don't think that\nis accurate. I think it's clear that the advisory\ncommittee didn't mean that. And in fact, all of the\ncircuits have recognized that there are technical aspects\nto rule 11 and there are core concerns of rule 11, the\ncore concerns being the (c)(1), (2), (3), and (4) and the\n(d). That is, the (c) -- the (c) aspects which go to\nintelligence of the plea and the (d) aspects which go to\nvoluntariness of the plea. Those are the core aspects.\nThose are what are necessary in order for the court to\ntake an intelligent and voluntary plea.\nThere are many other aspects to rule 11. It has\ngrown very large over the years. Those are more technical\naspects of the rule, and that is what the committee was\nconcerned about. If you look at when the committee added\n(h) into rule 11, they specifically noted their -- their\ndisagreement with the circuits that were vacating pleas\nfor technical violations, for the failure to tell a\ndefendant that he could be subject to a perjury charge for\nany false statements, for the failure to tell a defendant\nabout a special parole term. Those are the concerns that\nthe committee had: the technical errors versus the core\nconcern issues.\nAs to those technical errors, there could be\nother proceedings that would be relevant to that. Most\nnotably and the -- what -- the cases the committee cited\nin discussing these concerns would be a sentencing\nproceeding. So, for example, the defendant is not told\nabout the possibility of restitution, but restitution is\nimposed at sentencing, and there is -- neither the\ndefendant nor his counsel says, restitution, where is that\ncoming from? Those are not core concerns. Those -- it is\nimportant -- the Government talks about --\nQUESTION: What is it in the -- what is it in\nthe language of the rule that supports your dichotomy\nhere? Substantial rights in rule 11(h)?\nMS. KNOX: Well, the rule itself --\nQUESTION: What -- what is the textual basis?\nMS. KNOX: I think the Court --\nQUESTION: You're saying that there's some\nimportant rule 11 violations and unimportant ones.\nMS. KNOX: I think the Court itself recognized\nin Hyde that all provisions of the rules are not the same\nin the (c) and (d) provisions.\nQUESTION: What is the -- what is the textual\nbasis in the rule for that?\nMS. KNOX: Both the (c) and (d) start out with\nlanguage that says: a court may not accept the plea\nunless. That was the language this Court looked at in\nHyde in deciding that there were provisions of this rule\nthat did not stand on the same footing as other provisions\nof the rule.\nQUESTION: Well, your restitution analysis is\nunder (c)(1).\nMS. KNOX: That's true. It is --\nQUESTION: So, then that -- so, then there is no\ntextual basis for your distinction.\nMS. KNOX: Well, at the time that -- that (h)\nwas added into rule 11, the provisions of (c)(1), (2), and\n(3) -- excuse me -- (c)(1), (2), (3), and (4) did not\ninclude the provisions about restitution. But if you look\nto what this Court has held is necessary for a knowing and\nvoluntary plea, those are covered primarily by the (c) and\n(d) provisions. Those are requirements that are necessary\nin order for this plea to be valid. They are not subject\nto a harmless error analysis other than to say an\nunconstitutional plea necessarily affects the substantial\nrights of the defendant.\nQUESTION: You -- you said a moment ago -- I\nbelieve you referred to a case called Hyde.\nMS. KNOX: Hyde.\nQUESTION: I don't see that in your brief. Is\nit H-y -- is it a case from this Court?\nMS. KNOX: Yes. It's a 1998 court where the\nCourt -- the issue before the Court in Hyde had to do with\nwhether a defendant could withdraw a plea under rule 32(e)\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure without a fair\nand just cause. And the Court held no, that he would need\na fair and just cause, and it specifically -- one of the\nmajor reasons the Court gave for doing that was to say\nthat the only prerequisites to accepting a plea in the\ndistrict court are fulfillment of the duties of the court\nin rule 11(c) and (d). And that once that happens, the\ncourt can accept the plea and that the other --\nQUESTION: Well, does -- I don't see how that\nreally bears on the question of whether there can be\nharmless error or not.\nMS. KNOX: The point I was trying to make, Mr.\nChief Justice, is that there is a basis for distinguishing\nsome of the rule 11 violations from other rule 11\nviolations, that they do not all stand on equal footing.\nAnd I was only pointing out --\nQUESTION: But, you know, even if they don't all\nstand on equal footing, certainly the -- the provisions\nadded in '74 suggest that all of them are subject to\nharmless error.\nMS. KNOX: The --\nQUESTION: I mean --\nMS. KNOX: -- advisory committee notes that went\nalong with the addition of (h) --\nQUESTION: No. I mean -- I mean the rule -- the\nadditions themselves don't make any effort to distinguish\nbetween the various parts of rule 11.\nMS. KNOX: The committee notes --\nQUESTION: I -- I wasn't asking about the\ncommittee notes.\nMS. KNOX: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: I was asking about the provisions of\nthe rule themselves.\nMS. KNOX: No. On the face of rule 11, the\nlanguage in rule 11 itself draws the distinction only\ninsofar as (c) and (d) have that special provision in it\nwhich says the court may not accept a guilty plea unless,\nand the other aspects of rule (c) -- rule 11 do not have\nthat provision.\nThe committee notes, though, are the legislative\nhistory behind this rule and they tell us a lot about what\nthe committee meant when it added (h) into the rule. And\nthose committee notes make it clear that they were, in\nfact, drawing the distinction that I am offering, and in\nfact, every circuit has drawn that distinction.\nQUESTION: Where? I'm looking at the --\nQUESTION: What part of the notes?\nQUESTION: -- at the notes, the advisory\ncommittee notes, on the addition of (h), and what\nparticular part do you say makes it clear that --\nMS. KNOX: Well, first, we should back up to the\nyear before (h) was added in. At that point, the advisory\ncommittee was adding a provision about special parole to\nthe rules, and when they did that, they were noting that\nthe violations that would not necessarily cause -- cause a\nnecessity to vacate the plea.\nWhen it did that, the committee spoke about\ncertain technical provisions of the rule being\nqualitatively distinct from the core provisions of the\nrule that went to voluntariness and intelligence. They\nspoke disparagingly of circuits that were vacating pleas\nbecause the defendant was not told of his -- of being\nsubject to perjury prosecution for a false statement, and\nthe committee specifically noted that because that kind of\na right did not go to the intelligence of a plea, that it\nstood on a different footing. Those are the types of\ncomments that the advisory committee has made that make it\nclear.\nThe other thing in rule (h) --\nQUESTION: Were those comments made in\nconnection -- are -- are they placed in the record beside\n11(h) and 11(g)?\nMS. KNOX: They -- well, no. They were put into\nthe committee notes the year before (h) was added. But\nwhen (h) was added, the court -- as I've already made\nreference to, the committee specifically said that the\nclass of rule 11 errors that would be considered harmless\non appeal would be limited. They referred to a number of\ncases that had been decided by the circuit where the\ncircuits -- they -- they used those as examples of what\nwould be considered harmless under (h) and what would not\nbe considered harmless under (h). The examples they give\nof what would be considered harmless were the so-called\ntechnical violations: the failure to tell him about the\nperjury prosecution, the special parole. The examples\nthey give of what would be considered harmless under (h)\nare the intelligence and voluntary: failure to tell him\nabout the nature of the offense, allowing the prosecutor\nto advise him, which they said would be inherently\ncoercive. The -- the committee itself in those examples\nhas drawn a distinction in deciding what would be harmless\nand what would not be harmless between those errors that\ngo to voluntariness and intelligence.\nThe issue of whether the error is plain error or\nharmless error is also something that the committee --\nit's fairly clear that the committee considered and\ndecided not to apply plain error. The concerns that the\ncommittee had were, as I mentioned before, the technical\nversus core concerns. And the other concern the committee\nexpressly dealt with was the difference between direct\nappeal and collateral review. They were concerned about,\nunder McCarthy, circuits vacating pleas on collateral\nreview and adversely affecting the interest in finality.\nTo respond to those concerns, they drafted (h).\nTo do that, they went to rule 52. They adapted the\nlanguage of rule 52(a). They didn't borrow it verbatim,\nbut they adapted the language of 52(a) and they put it in\n(h). Every case that the advisory committee was looking\nat that raised its concerns and that generated the need in\ntheir minds for (h) was a case where no objection had been\nmade in the lower court. They looked at rule 52, and they\ntook what they wanted to be the applicable part of 52 and\nput it into 11.\nQUESTION: In other words, your argument is that\nthe -- that they have shown -- and I take it they have\nshown in this litany of examples that you referred to a\nmoment ago -- a series of situations that they wanted to\naddress. Those were all situations, which under rule 52\nalone, would have been dealt with on a plain error\nstandard, and they nonetheless imported into -- into rule\n11 nothing but the harmless error standard.\nMS. KNOX: That's right.\nQUESTION: Is that your factual claim in a\nnutshell?\nMS. KNOX: Yes.\nAnd it makes perfect sense that the committee\nwould do that. Rule 11 and rule 11 variances are\ndifferent than the typical type of proceeding in error\nthat appellate courts deal with. Rule 11 does not give\nrights to a defendant. Rule 11 puts a duty on the court.\nIn a typical case, a rule -- take rule 43, which deals\nwith the right to be present at all proceedings. That\ngives the right to a defendant. And therefore --\nQUESTION: Maybe this is a little bit\nrepetitive, but -- but assuming you're right that they did\njust import this and didn't discuss or intend to change\nwhat you look to to decide if there is a harmless error,\nwhat about Justice O'Connor's question? Because in the\nnote, they do say what you should look to is the\ntranscript of the colloquy and also the other -- other --\nthe exact words, but you probably know the exact words --\nthe other portions of the limited record made in such\ncases. Well, then why wouldn't we look at the other\nportions, which include the arraignment and all the things\nthe Government wants us to look at?\nMS. KNOX: I can only answer what I answered to\nJustice O'Connor, which is that they were referring to the\nmore technical aspects of rule 11 and not the core\nrequirements. And I base that only on what McCarthy --\nQUESTION: Then from your point of view, it\nisn't a question of what we should look at. We should\nlook at this. It's a question of whether there are some\nthings that simply don't fall within (g) -- or (h) rather.\nSome things simply don't fall within (h). In other words,\nthere are some things (h), substantial error rule, doesn't\napply to in your opinion? Substantial rights.\nMS. KNOX: Well, both of those. I -- I contend\nboth of those things so that violations or variances of\nrule 11 that go directly to the voluntariness or\nintelligence of the plea are by definition prejudicial\nbecause they do affect the substantial rights.\nQUESTION: So that you -- you are essentially\nasking us to restore the automatic reversal rule with\nrespect to this piece of advice; that is, if you plead\nguilty, you give up your right to counsel at trial. I\ntake it that your case boils down to that. You say as to\nthat bit of advice, because it's so fundamental, there\nshould be an automatic reversal rule if the judge doesn't\ngive it.\nMS. KNOX: No, I'm not actually advocating an\nautomatic reversal rule. I'd be comfortable with that,\nbut it's not actually where the Court has to go.\nQUESTION: But what's the difference between\nyour position and --\nMS. KNOX: Because in order to determine whether\na plea is intelligent, it turns on what knowledge the\ndefendant has. And so the -- when there is an omission by\nthe district court as to the requirements of rule 11, then\nwe -- we don't know whether he has that intelligence -- he\nhas that knowledge or not. It would be possible from the\nrule 11 colloquy to determine that he, in fact -- even\nthough the court failed to give him the advice, he in fact\nhad that knowledge.\nAn example would be that he -- the nature of the\noffense, for example. There could be a colloquy where the\ncourt fails to tell him about the nature of the defense --\noffense, but the colloquy at the rule 11 proceeding itself\nindicates the defendant actually knows the elements of the\noffense either because it comes out when he gives\npersonally a factual basis or his attorney says something\nabout it when he is standing there.\nAs to the right to counsel at trial, it could --\nthere could be something that happens at the rule 11\ncolloquy that would, in fact, put the defendant on notice\nthat he has that right.\nQUESTION: What's something?\nMS. KNOX: For example, when the court gives him\nhis right about confronting and cross examining witnesses,\nit could be given to him in the context of his attorney\ndoing it. So, the court advises him, for example, that if\nyou went to trial, you would have the right through your\nattorney to confront and cross examine the witnesses\nagainst you. That would clearly put him on notice at the\nrule 11 colloquy.\nMcCarthy didn't allow even for that type of\ninquiry. McCarthy was just here are the rule 11\nrequirements. If it -- if they're not met, you reverse.\nMine would -- my argument, contention would take\nit a little further, which is here are the requirements of\nrule 11. If they are not met and they go to the\nintelligence of a plea, you look only to the rule 11\ncolloquy to decide whether he otherwise was put on notice\nof that right.\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question? Do you\nagree with the Government that, assuming that you're right\nthat it's harmless review, assume the burden is on the\nGovernment to establish harmlessness, but that they may\nlook at the entire record, not just to the plea colloquy,\nthat if we look at the entire record, we must conclude\nthat the error was harmless?\nMS. KNOX: Absolutely not.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMS. KNOX: Because in this record we have two\nproceedings that occurred months before the taking of Mr.\nVonn's pleas. Both of those proceedings were mass\nadvisements. There was nothing personal between the\ndefendant and the court. There was no real attempt to\nmake sure that he understood --\nQUESTION: How about the fact that the defendant\nwas actually preparing for trial a week earlier? Is that\nin the colloquy? Or pardon me. In the record?\nMS. KNOX: Well, it's in the record that there\nwas --\nQUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I\nthought this case was scheduled for trial and they were\nactually preparing for the trial.\nMS. KNOX: It is in the record that it was\nscheduled for trial. It is also clear from the record\nthat there was somewhat of an ongoing discussion, perhaps\ndisagreement, between defense counsel and Mr. Vonn as to\nwhether he was going to plead or not. So, the record is\nunclear exactly as to how much preparation --\nQUESTION: Is there any evidence on the record\nto the effect that his defense counsel had said to him, by\nthe way, if we go to trial, I'm out of here?\nMS. KNOX: No.\nQUESTION: Okay. Can't we draw an inference\nfrom the fact that there is no such thing on the record?\nMS. KNOX: No. You know, I have -- defendants\nbelieve all sorts of things that may seem odd to attorneys\nand judges who are familiar with the system. Mr. Vonn was\na first-time offender. There's no evidence that he was\nfamiliar with exactly how the system worked. It seems\nextremely odd to all of us sitting here today that a\ndefendant who has an attorney at all pretrial proceedings\nwould have any reason to think that his attorney was going\nto disappear for trial. But there are defendants who\nbelieve that kind of thing.\nQUESTION: Well, in this very case, I thought he\noriginally entered a plea to one charge, but he was going\nto go on to trial on the other. There was no doubt about\nthat, was there? They were continuing to prepare for\ntrial on another charge.\nMS. KNOX: They -- it is true that the -- the\ngun use allegation had been set for trial. Whether they\nwere preparing or not is unclear from this record because\nwhat is clear from the record is that there was a\ndisagreement about the defendant. And in fact, when --\nwhether he would plead. And in fact, when the defendant\neventually pled to that second charge, the gun use\nallegation, he specifically denied the elements that would\nmake his activity criminal. He specifically denied that\neither he personally had a gun or that he had any\nknowledge of his co-defendants having guns.
