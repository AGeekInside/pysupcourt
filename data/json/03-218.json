THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Child Online Protection Act addresses a\nproblem that all three branches of our national Government\nhave repeatedly and consistently described as compelling,\nthe pervasive and essentially unavoidable commercial\nInternet pornography that inflicts substantial physical and\npsychological damage on our children.\nCOPA was carefully drafted by Congress after\nhearings, debate, reports, and findings according to\nexplicit guidance from this Court as to how constitutionally\nto address and resolve and deal with this -- this menace.\nThe compelling need is overwhelming and is growing.\nInternet pornography is widely accessible, as easily\navailable to children as a use of a television remote. This\nCourt has noted, as Congress has, that immense psychological\nand immeasurable physiological harm is done. The -\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, part of the problem is that\nthe pornography laws that would apply to adult viewers don't\nseem to be enforced very well, the obscenity laws. There\nare very few prosecutions, and yet there's all kinds of\nstuff out there. What's -- what's going on?\nMR. OLSON: Well -\nQUESTION: I mean, if they were enforced, a lot of\nthe problem would be assisted.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- in the first place, Justice\nO'Connor, while there may have been some lapse in -\ndiminution in obscenity prosecutions a number of years ago,\nthe information that I'm given, and it's not in the record,\nis that 21 indictments have been brought in the last 2\nyears, 17 have involved Internet. But the problem with\nrespect to the children is the material that is so widely\navailable on the Internet that doesn't reach the definition\nof -- that is not as bad as obscenity. It is a wide amount\nof information.\nThe legislative history described 28,000\npornographic sites in a -- this is also outside the record,\nbut if an individual goes to their Internet and -- and uses\nan Internet search engine and -- and types in the word, free\nporn, I did this this weekend, the -- your -- your computer\nwill say that there are 6,230,000 sites available. Now\nthat's available now -\nQUESTION: Well, how many sites are there available\naltogether on the Internet?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there are -- there are a great\ndeal more than that, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't know the\nexact number, but I believe the record, with respect to the\nChild Online, COPA, uses -- describes those numbers, but it\nis increasing enormously every single day, but the -\nQUESTION: Yes, even -- even the 28,000 was at the\ntime this bill was enacted.\nMR. OLSON: That's right.\nQUESTION: So I'm -- so I assume -\nMR. OLSON: And so the -\nQUESTION: -- it's much greater now.\nMR. OLSON: And every evidence that's available to\nus, and I don't think this is disputed by respondents, is\nthat the number of Internet sites is growing up\nexponentially.\nQUESTION: Those figures include the obscenity\nviolations too, I assume? You're -- you're not just talking\nabout sites that are affected by the Child Protection Act?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I'm talking about sites that -\nthat would be available to you -\nQUESTION: Other things too, right.\nMR. OLSON: -- to you or me -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. OLSON: -- or to a 12-year-old -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. OLSON: -- by typing in the word -\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. OLSON: -- free porn -\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. OLSON: -- where there would be no screen -\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. OLSON: -- preventing the child from getting to\nthat information.\nQUESTION: Yeah, and my first inquiry was -- was\nsuch a vast array of sites. There are so few prosecutions.\nIt's just amazing.\nMR. OLSON: Well, as I said, the number of\nprosecutions are increasing. What -- what the -- what the,\nand United States Attorney manual asks United States\nAttorneys to focus on obscenity where there's evidence of\norganized crime -\nQUESTION: Now, you said free porn, not free\nobscenity.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Presumably they still can't advertise\nfree obscenity. We -- we've drawn a line.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, and I -\nQUESTION: Then I don't really understand, but\nthere's a line there somewhere between obscenity and\npornography, right?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there's a line there that this\nCourt -\nQUESTION: Pornography is okay?\nMR. OLSON: Well, this -- what we're talking about\ntoday is something that would be described as -- and I'm\nusing the term pornography as a shorthand version to\ndescribe what was described in the statute as harmful to\nchildren. That's a -- statute itself refers to obscenity\nand material which is harmful to children. It then goes on\nto describe the category of material that is harmful to\nchildren using the language that was approved by this Court\nin the Miller case, as modified by the Ginsberg v. New York\ncase with respect to material which is harmful to children,\nwhich is broader than the definition of obscenity. The -\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not suggesting that the\nfree porn site that you call up would not include any\nobscene material?\nMR. OLSON: I did -- I didn't have time to go all\nthe way through all those sites.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: And -- and -- and it's not a pleasant\n--\nQUESTION: I'd imagine you found some that it was\nobscene.\nMR. OLSON: And it's -- I didn't. I -- the\nmaterial that I saw and I think that the Court would see is\nthat the people that are putting in -- these are -- this is\nmaterial in front of, and the legislative history describes\nthis, the material which is obscene is usually kept behind\nso-called blinders, which do -- which is a very good point\nhere, because the very mechanism that the statute requires\nis already in existence with respect to commercial\npornography sites.\nJustice Stevens, what the -- what the -- what the\npurveyors of this material do is put in front of the screen\nprovocative material that we submit would meet the\ndefinition of harmful to children and make that available to\neverybody to entice people to go the next step to use their\ncredit card or their age identification mechanism to go the\nnext step.\nQUESTION: General Olson, you said something that I\n-- I would question. You -- you said it's just like the\nblinder racks, but it isn't, because I don't have to give my\nID and I don't have to be concerned that someone will know\nthat this person with this address and this credit card\nwants to look at this material. You can -- you can -- the\n-- the -- the idea of the blinder rack is to protect the\nchild, but at the same time, the one who wants to see it\ndoesn't have to disclose his identity.\nMR. OLSON: Well, you're disclosing your identity,\nJustice Ginsburg, because you're standing there in public\nexamining those -\nQUESTION: How many people are going to be in that\nadult store, bookstore with you, as opposed to giving your\ncredit card number?\nMR. OLSON: What you're -- what you're -- what\nyou're disclosing your identity in person, I -- we would,\nthe Government would argue that that is more invasive, but\nthat nonetheless that there's some -- this is a counterpart\nto those blinder racks. In many of the convenience stores\nor adult bookstores or stores that you may go into where\nthose blinder racks are, there are cameras recording the -\nthe -- for protection of the shops, for other reasons,\nrecording the presence of the person. We submit that in the\nprivacy of one's home, use -- utilizing this information\nwith the provision in the statute -\nQUESTION: But the whole world can know about it if\nI've given my credit card number.\nMR. OLSON: It -- it is a -- it is a crime under\nCOPA for the persons providing that information pursuant to\nadult identification provisions, it's section, subsection d\nof COPA that makes it a crime to reveal that information.\nSo there is protection built into the statute that protects\nthe person's anonymity with respect to using that material,\nwhich is not protected. When a -\nQUESTION: Then why is there such resistance to\ngiving the ID and the credit card? People resist giving it,\ntheir credit cards, and I think the two reports said that\nthat was the case, the reports on COPA.\nMR. OLSON: Well, some -- some people may.\nCongress made a -- some people -- there -- the numbers are\nnot quantified at all, but there is privacy protection.\nGiving your identity is necessary going into a nightclub,\ngoing into an adult movie, or going into a bookstore and\nusing this material. Some people may say, I don't want to,\nthat's a price I don't want to pay, but it's not quantified\nin -\nQUESTION: You don't have to give your credit card\nto go into the nightclub or the movie.\nMR. OLSON: Well, you probably -- in some cases you\ndon't, in some cases maybe you do. I don't know if there's\na charge -\nQUESTION: There -- there may be resistance made\nthere not on the part of people to stand in front of blinder\nracks or to go into those portions of bookstores that are\nexcluded, that exclude children because of the presence of\npornography. There may be people who won't go into that\nsection because they don't want to be seen there or don't\nwant to be seen standing in front of the blinder rack,\nalthough they'd be happy to look at pornography if it was\nmingled in with everything else.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia, and\nCongress acknowledged that. There's no dispute by the\nGovernment -\nQUESTION: Did -- I thought that at least we have\nsome cases that -- that recognize that there is -- someone\ndoesn't have to come forward and say, I want this material.\nThat was the Lamont case where the person wanted to get\nwhatever was being sent and didn't want to say, oh yes, I\nwant to get that material. And Denver -- didn't Denver Area\nhave the similar thing that a customer doesn't have to say,\nI don't take that stuff off my screen -\nMR. OLSON: In the Denver Area case, the person had\nto make an application to unblock the material, that that\nmaterial -- there's a big distinction in the Denver Area\ncase because there wasn't a requirement of anonymity and a\nprotection of privacy in the statute. But I guess the\nbottom line, Justice Ginsburg, is that, yes, we have to\nacknowledge that there is some burden that is imposed when\nyou're required to identify yourself into the purveyor of\nthis material, but that -- but you get to, you have the\nopportunity to do that in the privacy of your own home.\nBy statute, a criminal statute protects the\nprivacy of your doing that, and the -- and the balance that\nCongress struck, which is what this Court dealt with when it\ndealt with this statute two -- on two previous occasions,\nthe Court did acknowledge that there's a compelling\ngovernmental interest here, and that significant harm is\nbeing done on a daily basis.\nThe magnitude -- we point this out on page 20 of\nour brief -- that 11 million children visit these porn sites\nevery week, and that between the ages of 15 and 17, 70\npercent of the children, according to the statistics that we\ncite, visited porn site inadvertently. It is very difficult\nto avoid.\nAs we describe in our brief, the use of innocuous\nnames, I'd mentioned last time that I was here and it hasn't\nchanged, Whitehouse.com is a porn site. Many of these\nthings that the evidence suggest children visit and visit\naccidentally or they're shown to by their friends, and then\nit's very difficult to get off -\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, the -- the court of appeals\naddressed certain principal flaws that it saw in the\nstatute, and I wish you -- you could address those. First,\nwhether there material taken as a whole includes the whole\nWeb site or -- or the article and so forth, and you, I\nthink, took a different position in the Third Circuit than\nyou took here. And -- and the second is this question of\nthe definition of the commercial use. Could you -- could\nyou address those?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. We -- we submit, and Congress was\nbasing its definitions on the decisions of this Court with\nrespect to taken as a whole, as this Court put it in the, I\nthink it's the Kois case, K-o-i-s case, from Wisconsin, and\nthat comes from -- that comes from the Roth decision of this\nCourt, the material to -- for -- for purposes of the\nperformance of this statute must be taken not only in its\ncontent, but in its context.\nNow, in many cases it won't be necessary to do\nthat, but something that might appear to be harmful in one\ncontext, if it's examined as a whole and it turns out to be\na part of an art exhibit or a anatomy book or a sex\neducation program, that would -- would have redeeming value.\nIt's this Court's decision that it's the protection of the\ncommunicator that the material be looked at as a whole.\nCongress carefully built that into the statute, and your\nsecond point, Justice Kennedy, is commercial purveyors of\nthis -\nQUESTION: Well, just -- but -- but before we leave\nthe -- the whole, what is -- your position changed between\nthe Third Circuit and here as to what we should look like,\nshould we look at the whole -- are you saying now we should\nlook at the whole Web site?\nMR. OLSON: You may look at the whole Web site and\n-- and -- and it may be appropriate to look at the whole Web\nsite, it may not be necessary. It may be in the defendant's\ninterest. We're not suggesting that the whole Web site\nshould not be looked at -\nQUESTION: But I mean, how -- how is the purveyor\nor the -- the broadcaster supposed to know?\nMR. OLSON: The broadcast -- with respect to the -\nQUESTION: I mean, if we can't define what -\nMR. OLSON: Well -\nQUESTION: -- what the whole means -\nMR. OLSON: Well, this Court -- what -- this Court\nhas defined that. It is -- requires looking at the material\nin the context it's which -- it's presented. In addition,\nin -\nQUESTION: But it's presented on a screen.\nMR. OLSON: It's presented on a screen -\nQUESTION: One -- one screen at a time.\nMR. OLSON: Certainly, Justice Kennedy, but one\npage in a book is presented at a time, one book in a\nlibrary, one magazine in a bookstore.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but as we all know, this -- this\nis -- a book, we know about book, but the Web site is\ndifferent, and that's where we're struggling.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's right, and we're saying\nthat the entire Web site may be looked at as a whole to see\nthe context in which the material is presented. These are\nprotections that the Court think are available and should be\nconcluded within the statute to protect the communicator.\nSo if the communicator is accused of putting the material\nout there that otherwise might fit these definitions, and\nthe person doing the communication said, you have to look at\nthe whole Web site, this was in an art gallery and so forth\nand those pictures were a part of that exhibit, that's a --\nthat's -- the reason why Congress put that provision in\nthere is that this Court repeatedly said it was necessary to\nprotect First Amendment rights, and in Ginzburg, U.S. v.\nGinzburg, the Court said the context might be considered in\nterms of how the manner is being purveyed, is there\npandering going on, is it being put out, is -\nQUESTION: But that's not obvious in the text of\nthe statute, because it says, it says any image, any\narticle, any image. Then it could be any image taken as a\nwhole.\nMR. OLSON: But -\nQUESTION: The question that -- that I have is, you\n-- you have clarified what the statute means in this\nrespect, you've also said that harmful to minors, the minor\nin view is the normal 16-year-old, but the statute doesn't\nsay that, and since we're dealing with a content\nrestriction, is it good enough for you to give a narrowing\nconstruction of words that are susceptible to a broader\nmeaning?\nMR. OLSON: The -- I submit that the -- what the -\nwith the issue of as a whole as a part of the statute, taken\nin the context which it is given, it -- it -- the -- this is\n-- this is part 6 of the definition, which is on page 189a\nof the appendix to the cert petition -- that the -- the\ncontext of that is quite clear that the material is -\nQUESTION: Well, three -- two -- yeah. No, it was\nthree, wasn't it, judges on the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit missed it?\nMR. OLSON: That's why we're here. But the -- the\nfact -- and I -- and I submit this. In the first place,\nthis Court has repeatedly said, and it said last year in -\nin connection with the McCain-Feingold case, that if there's\na reasonable construction or a narrowing construction to\nwhich the statute is reason -- readily susceptible, the\nCourt will adopt it in order to avoid the constitutional\nquestion, but I don't even think that's necessary in this\ncontext.\nThe contact of -- context of as a whole comes to\nthis Court from the -- comes to Congress through a series of\ndefinitions and actual cases by this Court, so -- and the\nlegislative history is manifestly clear that what Congress\nwas trying to do in this pace -- case -- is to adopt these\n-- this Court's definitions of those things, and if I can -\nQUESTION: Why did you -\nMR. OLSON: Those were book cases.\nQUESTION: -- pick 16-year-olds instead of 17-year-\nolds if you want to use the old -- the oldest minors? Where\n-- how -- how did you come up with 16-year-olds?\nMR. OLSON: Because this Court -\nQUESTION: And I mean, you know, maybe you -- you\nwon the battle by losing the war.\nMR. OLSON: Well -\nQUESTION: You -- you're going to allow to come in\nwithout any restriction under this statute for a 5-year-old\nanything that wouldn't be -- wouldn't be bad for a 16-year-\nold.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there's two -\nQUESTION: Is that a great victory?\nMR. OLSON: There's two answers to that, Justice\nScalia. As this Court has repeatedly said, the Constitution\ndoes not require impossible definitions. What is -- what\nputs a person reasonably on notice is an appropriate way to\ngo, and what -- the -- the reason why it was 16 rather than\n17, of course, is because this Court criticized the previous\nstatute because it drew the line at a different age.\nIt would be impossible, I submit, for Congress to\nselect a different age for every different piece of\nmaterial. What Congress was trying to get at was the worst\nproblem, the material that even with respect to 16-year-olds\nmeets the standards set out in the statute. That at least\n--\nQUESTION: How do we know that? I -- I doubt that\nvery much. I -- I think Congress probably wanted a good\ndeal of stuff that might be okay for 16-year-olds not to -\nnot -- not to be shown -\nMR. OLSON: No, as a matter of fact -\nQUESTION: -- to really young children.\nMR. OLSON: As a matter of fact, Congress was very\nclear that what it was adopting is what this Court had\npreviously considered in the American Booksellers case and\nthose blinder racks and the -- and the definition that came\nout of the American Booksellers case and the subsequent\nFourth Circuit definition of that term in that case, of\nwhich this Court subsequently denied cert. Those bookseller\nblinder rack cases are exactly cited in the legislative\nhistory.\nThis is a remarkable instance of where Congress\nwent through all of the things that the Court identified as\nproblems with the previous statute, grappled with each of\nthese definitions, adopted Court-approved definitions,\nstandards, and limitations with respect to what this Court\nhas agreed is a compelling problem.\nIf I can return to Justice Kennedy's concern about\nthe issue of -- take -- the commercial pornographers, the\nstatute is very clear that it refers to people that are in\nthe business of profiting from this material, and then the\nCourt -- the statute goes on to say what is the business of\nbeing engaged in this and says that someone that takes time,\neffort, or labor in the regular course of a business of -\nof profiting from the transmission of this material.\nSo the legislative history, the previous iteration\nof the problem in this Court makes it clear that what\nCongress was concerned about and was -- was not trying to\ncapture with this statute the person that occasionally\ntransmitted a -- a photograph or an image, but someone who\nis in the business of doing this on a regular basis for\nprofit.\nQUESTION: Well, but the -- the doing -- the this\nis having the whole Web site, and -- and I, you know, I -- I\nconcede it'd be a very difficult task if we told the\nCongress you come -- you come up with some definition of the\ncommercial pornographer. On the other hand, it seems to me\nthat this is very -- very sweeping. We -- even leaving\naside the question of non-profit associations and so forth,\npeople that have these Web sites will tell you that 100\npercent of what they do is for profit.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the answer to that, Justice\nKennedy, is the -- the fact that this is not any -- that\nthat definition, what the Congress adopted at the suggestion\nof this Court, was the same definition that this Court had\napproved in prior contexts with respect to obscenity, 18\nU.S.C. 1466, and that definition, commercial use of\nobscenity, is something that prosecutors and courts have\nbeen dealt -- been dealing with for a couple of -- for over,\nwell over a generation, for several decades. So -\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, may I ask you a question\nabout the -- on the -- the meaning of this very provision?\nSupposing a beer company or a cigarette company used for\nadvertising purposes regularly used material that would fit\nthe definition. Would they be violating the statute?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I believe they would, Justice\nStevens, that if the idea is to sell -- to use the material\nthat fits the definition, I keep saying the word pornography\nbecause I want to use the shorthand, and that is to make\ncommercial use of it by making money out of it, whether they\nsell -\nQUESTION: Well, they're making money out of the\nsale of -- of the product, which itself is not pornographic.\nMR. OLSON: That's -\nQUESTION: But -- but if it's regular advertising,\nyou think that would -- that would meet it?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I -- Congress would not have\nwanted to create that massive loophole, because the people\nthat are -- this is a multi-billion dollar business, the\npeople that are doing it would readily adapt to that type of\na loophole. The other one that was suggested by the\nrespondents is that -- and the, and by the Third Circuit -\nis that somehow Congress should have required that this\nwould be the primary business that the person was engaged\nin. Again, that would have been a massive loophole subject\nto constant litigation over what was the primary business\nand whether a person's surrounded the harmful material with\nan acre or two of unharmful material.\nWhat Congress was getting at is that people that\nare in the business, knowing and knowing the character of\nthe material, two other terms that are in the statute, that\nare making money distributing this material and who won't\ntake the steps necessary to protect minors from them.\nWith respect to the argument that the respondents\nmake and the court of appeals focused on that blocking at\nthe home might somehow be a problem, Congress carefully\nconsidered that, decided it would not be an acceptable\nsolution, except that it did at the same time enact -- that\nit enacted COPA, required that the Internet service\nproviders make that type of information available to people\nin their homes so that that could be in addition to what\nCOPA requires.\nThe fact is that blocking material in the home is\nboth underinclusive and overinclusive. It requires the\nconsumer to go out and buy a product and spend money to\nadapt it to technological improvements that are happening\nall the times, and it's readily avoidable. I did the same,\nthis again is outside the record, but I did this, anyone can\ndo this, the same experiment over the weekend. I went to\nGoogle and I typed in disable filter and you push the button\nand you will get a screen full of programs that will tell\nyou step by step how to dismantle the computer so your\nparents won't know about it. It is that easy, and you can\nput it back on.\nThese things are readily avoidable. So the burden\nthat Congress was -- was -- the burden that Congress imposed\nat the suggestion of this Court is to put the burden on the\nperson or persons making money on a regular basis from this\nproduct to take the minimal steps necessary to prevent the\ndamage that's done every day by minors by allowing people to\nuse mechanisms that are already in place. This Court\nmentioned it and Congress mentioned it, this adult check\nmechanism, that's another thing that -- that anyone can\ncheck out. Type in adult -- adult ID, and then press the\nbutton and you will find, I think there were 25 sites that\nmention in the congressional history which will provide an\nadult identification at a relatively nominal cost, I think\nit was 19.95 for a several-month period or something like\nthat, and the availability is such that the steps that can\nbe followed take a matter of less than a couple of minutes.\nSo in the privacy of the home, the adult who wants\nmaterial protected by the Constitution, in order to avoid\ndamage to children in the privacy of the home with statutory\nprotection as to anonymity, the -- the problem can -- it -\nit cannot be totally solved, but this is an important major\nstep and this is an example of Congress following the\ndirections of this Court as to how constitutionally to do\nit.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance\nof my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Olson.\nMs. Beeson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN E. BEESON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. BEESON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nCOPA violates the First Amendment for two\nindependent reasons. First, it is a criminal statute that\nsuppresses a wide range of protected speech between adults\non the Web, and second, the Government has a range of more\neffective, less restrictive tools available to protect\nminors. The Government's attempt to narrow the range of\nspeech that is affected by this statute defy the law's plain\nlanguage, the record, and plain common sense.\nEven under the Government's interpretation, COPA\ncriminalizes speech that under any definition adults have\nthe right to access. It criminalizes a depiction or even a\ndescription of nudity or even a description or depiction of\nthe female breast. It does not just cover sexual conduct.\nQUESTION: Now, I thought what it said is it picks\nup the definition that this Court has used for obscenity. I\nthought that definition was primarily an appeal to the\nprurient interest and it cannot have any -- it has to lack,\ntaken as a whole, serious literary, artistic, political, or\nscientific value, and it adds the word, for minors. For a\n16- or 17-year-old, I'm not sure there'd be much difference.\nMS. BEESON: I -\nQUESTION: And -- and so, I looked through all your\nstuff, or not all of it, but some of it, and I'd like you to\npoint out for me, what is the material there that has that\nserious scientific value, which you have quite a lot of -\nMS. BEESON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- but that the statute would forbid?\nMS. BEESON: Yes. Two points, Your Honor. First,\nthe obscenity statute actually covers only sexual conduct.\nIt does not cover mere depictions of -- of nudity and it\ndoes not cover just an image of the female breast, so I\nthink that that's an important difference.\nQUESTION: It has to be an image or whatever image\nthey are that appeal to the prurient interest. Now, that to\nme is material that does not communicate.\nMS. BEESON: Yes.\nQUESTION: It is material that is looking for a\nkind of emotional response, period. No communication and\ntrying to elicit a certain emotional response, all right?\nAnd it lacks serious artistic or cultural or other value,\nall right? Now, what is the material that you point to,\nbecause most of yours I think didn't fit that definition.\nIn fact, I couldn't find one that did fit it.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: So I want you to tell me which is the\none that fits it.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, and, Your Honor, the question\nultimately is what a speaker on the Web who communicates\nmaterial like this will do, what they think is covered by\nthe law, whether they will self-censor everything they think\n--\nQUESTION: Oh, I would imagine it's what we say is\ncovered by the law.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, I don't think so, under\nthis Court's precedents. In other words, if the -- if the\nrecord shows, and if the law covers, material that clearly\nhas value for adults but lacks value for minors, there has\nto be some distinction there or otherwise this turns into\nthe obscenity statute. There is no difference. In other\nwords, there is material that has -\nQUESTION: You're going a little fast. Would you\nslow down, Ms. Beeson? I didn't get your last -\nMS. BEESON: Sure.\nQUESTION: -- clause.\nMS. BEESON: Sure, sure, Your Honor, of course.\nThe point is that the serious value for minors clause does\nnot protect as much material as the serious value for adults\nclause in the obscenity statute. That by definition must be\ntrue, and in fact, as a society, just even using common\nsense -\nQUESTION: Did you get my question? I wanted you,\nI was serious in my question.\nMS. BEESON: Yes.\nQUESTION: I want to know, I would like some\ncitations. You don't have to -\nMS. BEESON: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- hold it up.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But I -- I want to know what you think,\nin other words, are your prime examples, because I'm tempted\nto look at them, and if I thought that this statute didn't\ncover it, why not say so? Why not say all these things that\nthe ACLU is worried about, given the Government's effort,\nare outside the statute? Would that take care of your\nproblem? But tell me which they are.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, let me do that. First, there are\nnumerous discussions in the -- in the record of lesbian and\ngay sexual pleasure and the pleasure of sex outdoors. This\nis not sex education materials. These are materials\nintended for adults which explicitly discuss sexual\npleasure.\nLet me give a few citations: PlanetOut, in the\njoint appendix, 658 to 69; BlackStripe, the joint appendix,\n753 to 57; and the Susie Bright column. She is a sex\ntherapist, she is -- she talks about sexual pleasure. She\nis not talking about educational material. The purpose of\nher columns are to invite adults to discuss and to read\nabout sexual pleasure if they want -\nQUESTION: Exactly, and I don't think that that's\nprurient. I think a discussion about sex is a totally\ndifferent thing from a -- a discussion that is itself\nsupposed to be part of a sexual response, all right?\nThey're night and day different.\nMS. BEESON: Your -\nQUESTION: Now -- now you tell me why that isn't\nso.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, let me put this another\nway. This statute covers written text. All of the exhibits\nthat have been put in by the Government are of images.\ndon't know what else could be covered that is written text\nthat, you know, other than our client's material, in other\nwords, what is left. That is what they are. They are -\nthey are prurient discussions, they are intended for adults,\nthey have value for adults, but they lack value for minors.\nThat is the concern. It's a very big concern. There are a\nlot of people on the Web that communicate that.\nAnd as a society, again, there's a lot of material\nin this, we have defined a wide range of material as having\nvalue for adults and lacking value for even older minors. A\n16-year-old cannot get into an R-rated movie. If you're a\nspeaker on the Web and you communicate material that's like\nBertolucci films, for example, or Sex and the City, you are\ngoing to be very, very worried. The Government has made\nyour speech a crime and you have only three options under\nthe statute. All of those options violate the First\nAmendment.\nThe first option is that you can take a risk and\nleave your speech up there, Justice Breyer, as you're\nsaying, you know, leave it up there. You're Susie Bright\nand you think that your -- your speech is not covered. What\nhappens? You can go to jail, not because you made that\ncolumn deliberately available to a minor, but because you\nmerely displayed the column to the general public. That is\na pure violation of this Court's rule in Butler v. Michigan\nthat you cannot make it a crime to display material to\nadults in the name of protecting children.\nThe second option. You're worried, you don't want\nto go to jail, you self-censor. Everything that you have\nself-censored, adults had the right to access. It violates\nthe First Amendment for the Government to do this through\nthe statute.\nThe third option is that you can set up costly\nscreens, which the record shows drive away your users. The\ndistrict court and the court of appeals also specifically\nfound that because of the risk of criminal penalties, it's\nquite likely that you never get to the defenses because the\nvast majority of rational speakers, when faced with this\nchoice, are going to self-censor, and that is speech that\nadults had the right to get.\nThis Court, for that reason -\nQUESTION: You're talking about self-censoring.\nYou're meaning an interpretation of the statute that is not\nwarranted by the -- the proper interpretation, I take it?\nMS. BEESON: No, I'm not. I -- no, I'm not, Your\nHonor. I think this is very different than the -- than that\nproblem, the self-censorship problem with the obscenity\nstatute, and here's why. Under the obscenity statute, if\nyou self-censor material that is actually obscene, there's\nno First Amendment problem.\nQUESTION: That's the whole point of the thing.\nMS. BEESON: Exactly. There's no First Amendment\nproblem. That speech is illegal. If you self-censor speech\nunder COPA that we can all agree is harmful to minors,\nwhatever that is, it's harmful to minors, you have self-\ncensored material that adults have the right to access.\nThat's the fundamental difference, and that is why this\nself-censorship is problem with this statute is so much\nbroader than it -- than it could ever be in the obscenity\nstatute.\nNow, you also have -\nQUESTION: If -- if you run that self-censor, I\nmean, you -- you could not have any laws protect. I -- I\nsuppose the laws that require certain categories of\nmaterials to be put in these, what do we call, the blinder,\nblinder racks, I -- I suppose that -- that's invalid on the\nsame basis because those magazines that want to appear in\nthe general readership rack will self-censor them -\nthemselves so that they won't be put in there, right? So\nall of those, and I think every state has laws like that,\nthey're all invalid because of self-censorship?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, we think that -- first of\nall, this Court has never upheld an -- a harmful to minors\ndisplay statute, and in fact -\nQUESTION: I understand we haven't, but what --\nwhat's your view? The argument you're making suggests that\nthey're all bad.\nMS. BEESON: We think that that is one of the three\nFirst Amendment burdens that these kinds of statutes impose.\nThe first one is the self-censorship problem. The second\none -\nQUESTION: All right. But that alone is not\nenough, you think?\nMS. BEESON: We think that it would be enough -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. BEESON: -- but the point is under COPA -\nQUESTION: Then all the blinder racks are bad?\nMS. BEESON: And under -- under this law -- under\nthis law, Your -- Your Honor, there are two additional\nburdens which are much greater than the online blinder rack\nstatutes, and in fact, it's quite notable that even though\nsome states, it's about half of the states that have display\nstatutes as opposed to statutes like Ginsberg that make it a\ncrime to simply sell directly to a child material that's\nharmful to minors, those same states that have passed and in\nsome cases upheld offline display statutes have now struck\ndown online display statutes because they have reached the\nsame conclusion that the district court and the appellate\ncourt in this case found and that is that there is -\nQUESTION: Well, their supreme courts did, their\nsupreme courts did. I mean, don't represent it as a\njudgment of the people of the states by their legislature.\nYou're saying that -- that there were state supreme courts\nthat struck it down, right?\nMS. BEESON: I'm saying that there are -- there\nwere Federal courts that have struck down now seven state\nonline harmful to minor statutes because they have\nrecognized the distinction between those statutes in the\nonline context and the offline context, and let me just get\nto that second problem, you know, self-censorship being the\nfirst problem, self-censorship of speech that under any\ndefinition is protected for adults.\nThe second one, the -- let's just assume that you\n-- that you want to go ahead and try to set up these\nscreens, first of all, a credit card is a form of payment,\nit is not an ID. This is not just a matter of flashing your\nID if you're a young-looking adult and the bookstore owner\nis not quite sure that you're -- you're an adult yet. This\nis a matter of every single adult having to -- to provide\ntheir credit card to a Web site every time they visit a new\nWeb site. The -\nQUESTION: But there's a -- there's an alternative,\nthe ID, you -- it doesn't have to be a credit card.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, there is an alternative in\nthe statute. What the record shows is that to get an adult\nID, the primary way to get that is through a credit card.\nSo another problem you have very similar to the problem\nidentified by this Court in Reno v. ACLU is that, you know,\nalmost all adults without credit cards have no way to access\nthis speech at all, and again, you don't even -- you don't\neven get to this problem if, of course, the Web speaker has\nchosen the first option and has self-censored and not even\ntried to set up the screens.\nSo the other -- the -- the other thing that's very\ndifferent, of course, about the blinder rack statutes is\nthat none of them required the adults to actually register\nor disclose their identity. Credit cards create a permanent\ntransaction, a permanent record of the transaction, and the\n-- the potential for abuse, because they are a form of\npayment, is much greater than merely flashing an ID.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the Government says that\nthere's a statutory protection that they cannot -- that the\n-- the person who gets the information can't pass it on to\nthird parties.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, there was actually -\nthere actually was a similar protection in the Denver Area\ncase, which this Court found irrelevant given the remaining\nburden on -- on adults having to identify themselves before\nthey seek access. In both the Denver Area case and in the\nPlayboy case, this course -- Court -- struck down very\nsimilar burdens on adult speech. The burden here is much\ngreater because the quantity and diversity of speech\naffected is much greater and the number of users affected is\ngreater.\nI would also like to point out that there's -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMS. BEESON: -- loophole in that privacy\nprotection, which is -- which is right in the -\nQUESTION: Well, who -- who says that they're\nguaranteed anonymity? I mean, if you go buy a gun, you're\ncertainly not guaranteed anonymity.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, the anonymity -- there\nactually -- this Court has held, of course, that there is a\nright to access --\nQUESTION: When -- what -\nMS. BEESON: -- protected speech anonymously, but\nthat is not really what's at issue here. What's at issue is\nwhat the effect of the law is on protected speech for\nadults, and what the anonymity cases show is that if you\nhave to give up your anonymity, a lot of people are going to\nbe deterred, and that's what the record in this case shows\ntoo.\nGeneral Olson acted as if there was nothing in the\nrecord about the number of times. In fact, there is quite a\nlot in the record.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you say you're not relying\non what you refer to as anonymity cases for this\nproposition?\nMS. BEESON: I'm saying that I think that those\ncases are relevant only to the extent that they show that\nanonymity often deters -- that the -- the loss of anonymity\nwill deter viewers. Here there is evidence, and it isn't\neven just the -- the loss of anonymity that's the problem,\nit's also the stigma of being associated with material\nthat's been labeled by the Government as illegal, and that\nwas a stigma that the Court also found relevant in striking\ndown the Denver Area case.\nI wanted to just quick -\nQUESTION: If -- if it really -- if it really were\nillegal, then the stigma would be irrelevant, don't you\nthink?\nMS. BEESON: The -- the -- if it were illegal to?\nQUESTION: Suppose you were stigmatized by having\nsubscribed to poor -- to obscenity. You couldn't object to\nthat.\nMS. BEESON: No, no, no. But here, again, the -\nthe speech is protected for adults. They have the right to\naccess as -- as the Court held in Lamont and in Denver Area\nand in Playboy.\nQUESTION: Now, you have a third -- the third\npoint. The first is there's too great a risk of self-\ncensorship. The second is a screening requires loss of\nanonymity, and what's the third?\nMS. BEESON: The -- the third was the four -- first\npoint I made, Your Honor, which is that if you -- the\ndefenses don't help you at all if you take a risk and -- and\nassume that your speech is protected and in fact the\nGovernment thinks it isn't. You know, you're Susie Bright,\nyou put the column up, you think it's, you know, you think\nit's okay. The defenses don't help you and you're going to\njail, not because you gave it deliberately to a child, but\nbecause you displayed it to an adult.\nQUESTION: Well, that seems to me just really much,\nvery much like the point that -- that the statute sweeps too\nbroadly, there's a risk of too great self-censorship.\nThat's really the same point, isn't it?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, I -- I don't think it is\nthe same point. I really think it's a -- it's a very\ndistinct point, because the point is the speaker has two\nchoices. They can either take a risk and display the\nspeech, in which case they go to jail. They go to jail not\nbecause they gave it to a child, that's the only kind of a\nstatute this Court has upheld. That's the -- that's what\nthey upheld in Ginsberg is that you can make it a crime to\ndeliberately sell this material to the child. All the -\nall the -- all the Web publisher has done under this statute\nthat sends him to jail is to simply make it available to the\ngeneral reading public.\nQUESTION: All right. Suppose -- what in your\nopinion is the right way for Congress to go about this?\nThat is, I assume, and you may not assume, but assume with\nme that Congress is not interested in Susie Bright. That's\nall fine. They're not really interested in your examples.\nWhat they're interested in are -- is the professional\npornographer and we know who that is and we know what it\nlooks like, and it's too tough to go after them with the\nobscenity statutes because they say artistic, whatever it\nis, there's a set of reasons that hasn't been successful.\nSo here's their solution. It's called zoning. We\nwon't stop people from looking at the worst stuff if they\nwant to and if they're adults, but you have to take the\nsubway and go out of Times Square, of if you're on the\nInternet, you have to identify that you're not a child.\nNow, we know that's a burden, but it's far more consistent\nwith the First Amendment to let people look at anything they\nwant including this worst possible stuff, as long as they're\nnot hurting anybody else, and the way to deal with this is\nto zone just like we use to do in libraries. If you want to\nsee the stuff that's locked up, you have to go to the\nlibrarian and identify yourself and show you're not a child\nand she'll open it with a key, that used to happen, and you\ncould go look at it, all right?\nThat's Congress' solution. Now, if that is not a\ngood solution, what is? Is there no solution?\nMS. BEESON: Yes, there are a number of solutions\nwhich Congress has now passed which don't present the -- the\nproblems that this statute does. This is not a zoning\nstatute, it's a criminal statute, and because it's a\ncriminal statute it's far more likely to lead to the self-\ncensorship that -- that causes the big problem here.\nWe now have a Federal filtering law that this\nCourt upheld, so any child that's accessing the Internet in\na school or a public library has already -- is protected\nfrom most of these images. One of the most -- one of the\nimportant cites in the record that I want to mention here,\nthe Government put in more exhibits -\nQUESTION: Your organization didn't -- didn't\nsupport that -- that statute.\nMS. BEESON: I'm sorry.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BEESON: Yeah.\nQUESTION: Also, what else, because as you know\nfrom things I've written, I'm very skeptical about the\nability of filtering to deal with millions of families where\nthere are no parents at home during the day and it's very\ntough. So -- so that's one. I'll look at that. What's --\nwhat's two?\nMS. BEESON: If I could just mention the cite to\nthe record, Your Honor, because I think it's very important.\nThe Government put in a lot of sexually explicit images as\ntheir exhibits in this case. They stipulated that every one\nof the major filtering products blocked every one of the\nimages that they submitted as being a problem in this case.\nQUESTION: Where's that at in the record?\nMS. BEESON: That is in the joint appendix\nbeginning at page 170, that's the joint stipulation between\nthe parties, numbers 45 to 47. That is a pretty ringing\nendorsement for filtering software, and again, the district\ncourt specifically found -\nQUESTION: If it's working what do you do about the\nSolicitor General's contention that it's easy to turn the\nfilters off?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, first of all, that is not\nin the record. What the record shows and what the district\ncourt found was that the filters are more effective than\nCOPA, and the reason that they're more effective -\nQUESTION: When they're working. Do -- do you\ncontend -- I mean, if -- if we're uncertain whether it's\neasy to turn them off or not, let's assume it's not in the\nrecord. I -- it seems to me it's not a good argument on\nyour part unless -- unless you maintain, and perhaps can\nshow from the record, that it is -- it is not easy to turn\nthem off.\nMS. BEESON: Your -- Your Honor, under this Court's\nlong-standing precedents, any content-based regulation of\nspeech is presumptively invalid. It is the Government's\nburden to show that there is no less restrictive\nalternative, and they did not meet this burden under the\nclear record in this case. The district court very clearly\nfound that the filters were at least as effective. They can\nactually block material that is not even commercial that\ncomes from -\nQUESTION: When working, when working -\nMS. BEESON: -- foreign Web sites.\nQUESTION: When working. The district court didn't\nmake any finding -\nMS. BEESON: But -\nQUESTION: -- about how easy it is to disable them,\ndid it?\nMS. BEESON: Because the Government didn't put on\nany evidence, which is why he said he had to go outside the\nrecord to make that point, when we have only the record to\n-- to base the decision on here. Justice Breyer, to get to\nthe other options that are available, the other things that\nCongress can do, one that I want to mention is a new statute\nthat was passed, 18 U.S.C. -- I believe it's 2252(b) -- it\ngets at the Whitehouse.com problem. This is a law that\npenalizes sites that knowingly use misleading domain names,\nlike Whitehouse.com, in order to lure children to this sites\ninadvertently. That is another law -\nQUESTION: Statute -- has that statute been\nchallenged yet?\nMS. BEESON: That -- that statute has not been\nchallenged. It is on the books now, and -- and therefore it\nis -\nQUESTION: You think that's a good one, though?\nMS. BEESON: It is certainly narrower, Your Honor,\nthan this statute.\nQUESTION: I understand that, but you think it's\ngood, so we can count on the fact that that one's okay?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BEESON: I will argue only that it's -\nQUESTION: You will demur.\nMS. BEESON: -- clearly narrower. And one of the\nreasons that it's narrower, all -- all jokes aside, is\nbecause it gets more clearly at -- at what the statute is\naiming to get at, which is, you know, luring inadvertent\nviewers, especially minors, to particular sites, whereas\nthis -- this law makes it a crime for anyone, any individual\nrunning a small business, you know, Mitch Tepper, our client\nwho runs a sexual health network -\nQUESTION: No, no, I understand it's a lot\nnarrower. I've got -- I agree with you about that. I just\nwant to be sure you don't stop before I've listed all the\nalternatives that you think are possible.\nMS. BEESON: Yes, Your Honor, and thank you for\nreturning me to my -- to my task there. Another one is a\nlaw that was passed the same time that COPA was passed -\npassed, which requires Internet service providers to give\nall customers information about their filters.\nAnother misconception I think left by General\nOlson, you don't have to go out and buy another product.\nThe record shows that all of the major filtering, all of the\nmajor Internet service providers provide these parental\ncontrols as a -- as a default for parents. When you -- when\nyou set up your account with AOL, it asks you right then and\nthere, you don't have to pay extra, whether you want to\ninstall the parental controls.\nThere is also a new law -\nQUESTION: But why did Congress not think these\nwere adequate? I can't understand it. I mean, if that's so\nobvious, why -- why didn't Congress see that, that obvious\nfact?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, part of the problem, of\ncourse, is that most of these laws that I'm mentioning were\npassed after COPA was passed. COPA was passed very early on\nin this debate when the Internet was not as well understood\nas it is now. Frankly, the -- the solutions that it has\nthought up since then have been better, they've been\nnarrower, and they have had less -\nQUESTION: Screening existed. They certainly had,\nyou know, you're relying heavily on that. Those -- those\ntechnologies existed and Congress surely considered them and\nthought it was inadequate for some reason.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, the record in the case\nshows that it's at least as adequate and where, as here,\nthere's a record that shows that there is a broad chilling\neffect on protected speech for adults because this is a\ncriminal statute, those -- those tools are -- are -\nQUESTION: But you're back to your first point now.\nI've got down filters, I understand that, and I've got the\ndomain names, and I want to know if there's anything else.\nMS. BEESON: Yes. There are two other points I\nwould like to make on that. One is there's -- Congress has\nnow created something called the Dot Kids domain, which is a\nsafe environment in which there are sites that are reviewed\nthat are intended just for children. That Dot Kids domain\ncan interact with the filters in a way that allows a parent\nto set up the AOL account, for example, so that their\nyounger child has access only to the sites in the Dot Kids\ndomain.\nQUESTION: What -- what are -- what are the age\nlimits that are -- are specified there? Is there something\nfor the 6-, 7-year-old group and then up to the 15-, 14-,\n15-year-old group?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, I believe, I don't have\nthat statute in front of me, but I believe that that -- that\nthe idea is to set up a safe environment for children 12 and\nunder, that that -- that's the way that -- that it's defined\nthere. And then finally, of course, as we mentioned,\nvigorous enforcement of the obscenity law could solve some\nof these problems. The Government has not been doing that,\nand I think that before -\nQUESTION: But that, of course, in a sense is\ncontrary to the -- I mean, from a First Amendment point of\nview, isn't it preferable to draw obscenity prosecution\nlines favorably towards free speech? And that's -- I\nmention that because that seems to me the basic First\nAmendment dilemma that I am having, that it is actually\npreferable to lean in the direction of letting the adults go\nand see anything they want, virtually anything. But that\nmeans that there'd be some burden attached, and the burden\nthat's attached is the key to the spot -- locked room in the\nlibrary, the taking New York Times -- Times Square and\nmoving it out to Yonkers and some place, and here that you\nhave to identify yourself as an adult.\nThat's the true dilemma I'm having, so when you\nsuddenly say, oh well, let's, you know, launch a crusade\nagainst the obscenity, from a First Amendment perspective,\nthat might be worse. So what do you think?\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, obscenity -\nQUESTION: You don't really want that anyway, do\nyou?\nMS. BEESON: Obscenity is by definition speech that\nis not protected by the First Amendment.\nQUESTION: Yes, but there are a lot of hard lines\nin this area, and a set of prosecutors -\nMS. BEESON: There -\nQUESTION: -- who are now determined to go, to -\nto -- to crusade in this area could draw a lot of those\nlines differently from say you would.\nMS. BEESON: Well, and I -- and I, of course, am\nnot trying to say that those prosecutions wouldn't ever\nraise a First Amendment issue. Of course they would -- they\nwould. But this statute raises a First Amendment question\nin every single application. Every single time this statute\nis applied, it violates the First Amendment because the only\noptions available to speakers would either put them in jail\nfor making their speech generally available to the public or\n-- or prevent adults from accessing that -- that protected\nspeech because either the speaker has self-censored or\nthey've put it all behind a screen that the record shows\ndrives -- drives away the users, and I -- I think I was\ngoing to make just a another cite to the record that I think\nis an important one to note, and that is that the\nGovernment's own expert conceded that thousands of users\nwould be deterred from any single Web site as the result of\nany registration system, and that is, again, similar to the\nevidence that the Court relied on in striking down the\nstatutes regulating indecency in cable television in both\nthe Playboy and the Denver Area cases.\nThis statute has greater problems because it's a\ncriminal statute. Those statutes, of course, just involve\ncivil penalties that -- oh, I thought I had that cite to\ngive you but I actually don't -- I'll try to -- I'll try to\nfind it in a moment.\nThe -- the district court in its findings of facts\nspecifically noted that point about the Government's expert\nconceding thousands of -- of users.\nQUESTION: But, just clarify it for a minute. The\nreason that thousands are deterred are, one, they don't want\nto self-identify, and two, they're unable to have credit\ncards or something of that kind. Those are the two reasons?\nMS. BEESON: Yes, and they don't want to self-\nidentify because they're too embarrassed or because they\ndon't want to be stigmatized by being associated with the\ncontent.\nThere is an additional reason, which the record\nshowed, which I think is important to close with, and that\nis the nature of this medium. This is an -- a wholly\nunprecedented medium of communication. This Court found\nthat in Reno v. ACLU. It has extremely low barriers to\nentry. It allows users to access millions of sites just\nthrough this linking process.\nThe record also showed that by setting up these\nbarriers that kind of destroyed the nature of accessing\ninformation on the Internet.\nQUESTION: Would you tell me your response to\nGeneral Olson's argument that the self-identification\nproblem is not serious because there's a restraint on the -\non the transmitter's use of that private information?\nMS. BEESON: I -- I'm sorry, I didn't follow you,\nJustice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Well, his answer to your self-\nidentification problem is that self-identification to\nsomeone who by law is not allowed to pass that self\nidentification material on to third parties.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, this Court has -- has\nnever upheld any statute which -\nQUESTION: But why shouldn't we uphold that\nargument?\nMS. BEESON: Because it's so clear that it would\ndeter adults from accessing protected speech. I think that\nthat is -\nQUESTION: But I don't see if you rely on your\nreason for deterrence is fear of self-identification, and if\nthe statute makes that fear groundless, I'm not sure your\nargument is persuasive.\nMS. BEESON: Oh, let me then cite to one more\nthing, which I meant to get to before and I didn't, and that\nis that there is a very big loophole in the privacy\nprotection in the law and that is -- it's under (d), let me\nquickly find it -- under (d)(1), there was an exception --\n(d)(2), exceptions to the privacy protection, any -- any\nperson making a disclosure is not covered, I mean, can make\nthe disclosure as long as it's necessary to conduct a\nlegitimate business activity related to making the\ncommunication.\nThat's a fairly big loophole that I think would\nmake a lot of users very nervous, and of course, the -- the\ninitial problem is that they don't want to give their credit\ncard or their -- or their ID even to the Web site. I mean,\nthese are Web sites that they've never seen before. They're\nsurfing the Web. They're not trusted local stores, they're\n-- they're unknown Web sites.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but millions of users of the\nWeb give their credit card number in order to buy books or\nsomething else that's for sale. I don't understand why\nthat's such a terrible invasion of privacy.\nMS. BEESON: Your Honor, in fact, what the record\nshowed in this case was that the only time that Internet\nusers were comfortable giving their credit card was when\nthey were ready to make a purchase. This law applies to -\nas General Olson conceded, to just making the speech\navailable with -- surrounded by advertising. Anybody who\ndid that, it doesn't just apply to speakers who are selling\ntheir speech on the Web.\nIn closing, I just want to say again that this\nCourt has repeatedly held that the Government can't burn\ndown the house to roast the pig, especially with so many\nother tools available to protect minors more effectively\nthan this statute does. The Government cannot send adults\nto jail for displaying protected speech in the name of\nprotecting children. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Beeson. General Olson,\nyou have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Could you address that exception to the\ndisclosure thing that Ms. Beeson just brought to our\nattention?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. I don't -- I don't read it that\nway. I don't think that's the -- the exception is intended\nto -- to allow the person safe harbor by performing the\nfunction of the adult check. I mean, I think that's what\nit's intended for -\nQUESTION: Where --\nMR. OLSON: -- and it hasn't been, hasn't been\nidentified before as a giant loophole in the statute, and I\ndon't think it's susceptible to that construction.\nI wanted to go back to where Justice Breyer\nstarted, what would be covered by the statute? The examples\ngiven by the respondents were addressed in the Government's\nbrief and all three of the -- all of those examples we don't\nbelieve are covered by the statute. Susie Bright is not\nwithin, doesn't fit within the prurient interest in the -\nand would be defended on -- this is reminiscent of what the\nCourt was facing in the American Booksellers case, and the\nrespondents here were involved in that one as an amicus,\nwhere 16 examples were cited as the house was going to fall\ndown, the sky was going to fall.\nThis Court decided to remand that to the -- the\nVirginia Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court found\nthat none of the 16 parade of horribles would be even\ncovered by the statute. That's this all over again, and it\nflies in the face of the requirement by this Court to find a\nreasonable, a construction of the statute that would be, to\nwhich it would be reasonably susceptible that would deal\nwith those constitutional problems.\nAnd -- and these definitions, these definitions\nhave already been approved with respect to minors in the\nGinsberg v. New York case, so we're not -- and that's a\ncouple of -- several decades ago, so we're not dealing with\nsomething that is brand new. Susie Bright, by the way,\nwrites for Salon magazine. In order to get her column you\nhave to register.\nAdult IDs, you can get them with credit cards, you\ncan get them with a check, and as we point out in footnote 2\nof our brief, you can use a driver's license or a passport,\nso you don't have to necessarily use a credit card to do\nthat. The -- the deterrence issue, all of the -- all of the\n-- all the court of -- the lower courts decided is that some\npeople may be deterred, may be deterred, and some people may\nbe -- find this as an impediment. Some people may engage in\nself-center -- self-censorship, and to the extent that there\nare thousands of people, that's an infinitesimal quantity of\nwhat's on -- on the Web in itself.\nThe most important point here, with respect to\nalternatives, Congress considered, as this Court suggested\nit should, the various alternatives. The House, the Senate\nreport's good, but the House report, 775, which is cited all\nover the briefs on pages 16 through 20 considered all of\nthese examples, the tagging, the filtering and so forth and\nwent through all of the reasons why Congress found that they\nwould not be effective and that what COPA was providing\nwould be effective, that there were costs, the burden should\nbe on the commercial purveyor of the material and so forth.\nCongress went through all of these things and made specific\nfindings.\nAt the end of the day, it's important to emphasize\nthis is a facial challenge to a statute constructed\naccording to this Court's guidance, according to this\nCourt's decisions as to how to deal with a very serious\nnational problem. It contains a scienter requirement the\npurveyor of this material must know what's being done, he\nmust be engaged in the regular course of business, and I\ncan't recall -- I think it was you, Justice Breyer -- who\nasked the question, how else could Congress have done it?\nThis is a national problem. It's serious. It's causing\nirreparable injury to our most important resource, our\nchildren.\nCongress has been struggling with this. It\nlistened to what this course had -- Court had to say. It\nexamined the nature of the medium, because this is a\ndifferent medium, but one of the wonderful things about this\nmedium is also the -- one of the potentially dangerous parts\nof this medium. It's easily accessible to children in the\nhome and it's important that the Government be -- this\nNation and its three branches of government be concerned\nwith the care and welfare of children independent of the\nparents' responsibility.\nSo this is an example of a serious national\nproblem, Congress following conscientiously this Court's\nguidance as to how to solve the problem and then laying it\nout for this Court as to how it did so, and it came up with\nthis statute, which is constitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General Olson.\n"
