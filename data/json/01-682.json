        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-682, Kay Barnes v. Jeffrey Gorman.\nMr. Robbins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Eighth Circuit held in this case that a\nprivate plaintiff may obtain punitive damages in an action\nbrought against municipal government defendants under\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and title II\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nAlthough the court of appeals identified\nsubstantial evidence in the legislative record that\nCongress never intended this result, it thought that this\nCourt's decision in Franklin against Gwinnett County\nPublic Schools left it little or no choice in the matter.\nAs the Eighth Circuit read Franklin, once a cause of\naction has been created or inferred, it presumptively\ncarries with it all common law remedies, including\npunitive damages, unless Congress has specifically said\notherwise.\nQUESTION: Mr. Robbins, did any -- did the\npetitioners raise the Newport case at any time below?\nMR. ROBBINS: No.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. ROBBINS: The -- the party --\nQUESTION: I mean, it looks like the most\nobvious source of law on this topic. What's going on\nhere?\nMR. ROBBINS: In the lower court, my client took\nthe position that it was, in fact, an arm of the State,\nnot an arm of the municipal government. For various\nfactors -- it cited various factors that in its view\nwarranted an Eleventh Amendment immunity, not a City of\nNewport immunity. The court of appeals, in the decision\nbeing reviewed before this Court today, rejected that\nargument. We have not separately sought certiorari on\nthat decision.\nBut I -- I do want to add on that point, Justice\nO'Connor, that in our view it would be a mistake to take\nrespondent's suggestion that because my client took that\nposition in the lower court, that this Court should\ntherefore turn a blind eye to the City of Newport\ndoctrine. It seems to us that it's quite analogous to a\nsituation in which a litigant, for example, decided to\nargue only legislative history in the lower court and then\nbefore this Court -- and then someone said, well, you're\ntherefore constrained not to look at the words of the\nstatute. That seems --\nQUESTION: It doesn't change the issue, I take\nit.\nMR. ROBBINS: It does not change the issue. The\nposition the client took below was always that punitive\ndamages are unwarranted for a variety of reasons,\nincluding a reason that we are now urging by virtue of the\nclient having lost the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue\nbelow.\nQUESTION: Was there a reason?\nQUESTION: And I suppose it's not like an\nimmunity from suit that can be waived. It's -- we use the\nterm immunity, but it's not that sort of immunity.\nMR. ROBBINS: Exactly. It -- it is exactly the\nsense in which it was used in City of Newport as a\nbackground principle of law that Congress is assumed to\nhave taken into consideration in enacting the actual test.\nAnd we --\nQUESTION: Doesn't the Eighth Circuit allow you\nto argue in the alternative? I mean, you couldn't have\nsaid we have Eleventh Amendment immunity and -- and if we\ndon't, we're a municipality, and therefore Newport\napplies. You could have done that, I suppose.\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I think counsel could have\ntaken that measure. They didn't, but I don't think that\nit -- that that amounts to a waiver.\nQUESTION: What are we supposed to do then?\nBecause it seems to me that you're arguing there are two\npossibilities. One possibility is no one gets punitive\ndamages no matter who he sues, and the second is that,\nanyway, a person who sues a municipality can't get\npunitive damages. Your second argument may be a lot\nstronger than the first. So, am I supposed to go to the\nsecond argument that nobody has argued in the courts below\nat all, bypassing them, or am I supposed to go to the\nfirst argument which has enormous implications well beyond\nthis case?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I think the answer, Justice\nBreyer, is that we have urged both arguments. I think we\n-- we could prevail on the basis of either presumption.\nI -- I would, however, tell you why I think the\nCourt ought to address the broader issue and that is\nbecause, given the construction of Franklin that the\nEighth Circuit took in this case, there is no good reason\nto believe that were City of Newport called to their\nattention, they would have come out any differently. The\nEighth Circuit took Franklin to say that unless -- given\nthat there's a cause of action, whether explicit --\nwhether express or implied, that must necessarily carry\nwith it all common law remedies unless Congress has said\notherwise, which it rarely does --\nQUESTION: Well, the Eighth Circuit said\nappropriate remedies. So, don't we have to look at what\nappropriate means in this context?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I think that -- that's the\nlanguage from Franklin.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROBBINS: And we think Franklin is properly\nconfined to compensatory remedies for the reasons we've\nsaid in the brief. The Eighth Circuit's view of\nappropriate, however, Your Honor, was that it is\nsynonymous with whatever the common law has traditionally\nmade available by virtue of State law, by virtue of\nFederal law, by virtue of the entire corpus of law. And\nwhatever you can find on the books is, therefore,\nappropriate within the meaning of Franklin, as the Eighth\nCircuit saw it, and that, Justice Breyer, to return to\nyour question, is a doctrine of enormous capacity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Robbins, I don't understand why\nyou say if this Court says Newport or Fact Concepts,\nwhatever you want to call it -- it says, a municipality is\nimmune. Period. That takes care of your case, and if the\nCourt -- this Court were to say, Eighth Circuit, you\noverlooked the fact that municipalities are immune and\ntherefore in -- in this case you are wrong, and we\nreverse, now, that takes care of your client. Right?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I think it does. If --\nQUESTION: And why should we in your case, where\nthere is a clear ground, not decide it on that basis? Why\nshould we go to the next case that doesn't involve a\nmunicipality?\nMR. ROBBINS: Let me say two things with respect\nto that, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, the last thing I\nwant to do is talk the Court out of ruling for my client\non any ground.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: So, if the Court believes City of\nNewport is sufficient -- and we think it's quite powerful\n-- we'll certainly be glad of that result. But let me say\ntwo more things about it.\nThe first is even City of Newport requires\nlooking to the next step and asking, okay, that's the\npresumption. It's a strong presumption. Is there\nspecific evidence in the statute that overcomes it? For\nall the reasons we've said in the brief and I'd be glad to\nturn to, the evidence in this statute is quite\nextraordinarily compelling that, to the contrary, punitive\ndamages were foreclosed.\nSecond, I -- I wish I could be as confident as\nthe Court's -- as Your Honor's question suggests, that\nwere this case to return to the Eighth Circuit with\nnothing but a ruling about City of Newport, you know, in\nits sails, that the Eighth Circuit would take that mandate\nand take it and -- and come out differently. I'm not\nquite so confident about that because of the sweep of how\nthey read Franklin.\nQUESTION: If the Court --\nQUESTION: We would -- the -- the broader\nposition would be -- would be taking the case on the same\nbasis that the Eighth Circuit decided it. Right? On the\nbroader ground.\nMR. ROBBINS: I think that's correct.\nQUESTION: And there -- this is not a\nconstitutional matter.\nMR. ROBBINS: No.\nQUESTION: So, the doctrine of -- of observing\nthe narrowest possible constitutional ground does not\napply here. Right?\nMR. ROBBINS: No. Quite -- quite the contrary.\nThe question presented is what do these statutes mean\nafter all.\nQUESTION: So, this would be an opportunity to\n-- to do what the Court is supposed to do, and that is\nclean up confusion below on the meaning of a statute, and\nthe broader confusion is certainly much -- much more worth\nclearing up than the narrower confusion.\nMR. ROBBINS: Right, and I might say one of the\nmatters we've pointed to in the petition for certiorari\nis, in fact, that this misconstruction of Franklin is not\nconfined to this case, to this statute, and certainly to\nthe Eighth Circuit. It is a wide-ranging, I think, over-\nreading of what this Court said -- not just meant, but\nsaid -- in Franklin itself. And perhaps I might just turn\nbriefly to that initial question.\nIt seems to us, for several reasons, the Eighth\nCircuit has badly misunderstood what Franklin says. It\ndoesn't cover punitive damages. That's the short of the\nmatter. Punitive damages were, after all, not sought by\nthe plaintiff in Franklin, but more to the point, the\npremise of Franklin against Gwinnett County was drawn from\nBell against Hood and the cases that underlie Bell against\nHood, and that is an explicitory, compensatory rationale.\nThe idea in Bell was that courts have an authority --\nQUESTION: Explicitory?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Did you say explicitory?\nMR. ROBBINS: Good heavens, I hope not.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I like it though. It's good.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, what -- what I certainly\nmeant to say is that Bell and Hood stem from a line of\nauthority that says that courts have the authority, the\ninherent authority I -- I had meant to say, when -- when\ncharged with the construction of a statute to make good\nthe wrong done. And that is about as clear a statement of\na compensatory rationale as you could have.\nFranklin did not suggest that a plaintiff who\nhas been made whole, as Mr. Gorman was to the tune of $1\nmillion in compensatory damages, including $150,000 in\npain and suffering, has a right inferable through a\nstatute that speaks not a word to the matter, to an\nadditional presumption of punishment.\nQUESTION: Well, did the compensatory damages in\nthis case include damages for humiliation, or am I wrong\nabout that?\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I do not -- I have not seen\nan indication that it included that. I --\nQUESTION: In -- in this -- is the jury\ninstructed in this jurisdiction that compensatory damages\ninclude damages? Of course, pain and suffering, but is\nthat also humiliation? I thought humiliation was covered\nas part of the compensatory award.\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- we have included the\ninstruction, Justice Kennedy, at page 72 of the joint\nappendix, and I do not find a specific reference to that.\nI'd be glad to see if I can --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess it -- it goes to the\nmake-whole point. Assume a jurisdiction where humiliation\nis not part of the compensatory award, could the argument\nbe made, well, in order to make the person whole, you must\ngive punitive damages because it includes damages for\nhumiliation?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I guess I'd be inclined to\n-- to think about that in a case in which somebody had\nargued that below or here.\nQUESTION: But it wouldn't achieve that.\nMR. ROBBINS: But -- but --\nQUESTION: It wouldn't achieve that. Would it,\nMr. Robbins? I mean, you -- you would not tell the jury,\nyou know -- you're telling the jury, punish this person if\nyou think he deserves punishment. You're not telling the\njury, by the way, humiliation damages are not available,\nand therefore give this fellow as -- as much humiliation\ndamages, calling them punitive damages, as --\nQUESTION: But I want you to assume -- and I\nbelieve this is the law in many jurisdictions -- that\npunitive damages are given in part to ease the -- the --\nit's smart money in order to ease the -- the pain that the\nperson suffers, et cetera.\nMR. ROBBINS: Right. I -- I don't want to\nquarrel with the hypothetical, Justice Kennedy. It may\nvery well be that pain and suffering already embraces that\nconcept. In many jurisdictions, pain and suffering is not\ncompensable as a compensatory damages. And it may be that\nin the jurisdictions to which Your Honor adverts, punitive\ndamages are used to supplement a compensatory regime that\nfalls short of pain and suffering, which is not the case\nhere. This man received $150,000 --\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMR. ROBBINS: -- for the category called pain\nand suffering and he was made whole. And there's no\nsuggestion that he wasn't made whole.\nThe suggestion is that my clients should be\npunished, and that is something as to which the statute\nprovides absolutely no --\nQUESTION: Well, that's true, but the statute\ndoesn't say specifically about whether to give an\ninjunction, about whether you could give a trademark\nremedy. I mean, normally what the decisions have been of\nthe Court under Franklin -- I'm simply focusing you on\ntheir main argument. Under Franklin, the courts decide\nthere either is an ordinary private right of action, et\ncetera, or there isn't. And if there is, you take it as\nit is, ordinarily. And if there isn't, there's nothing.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nQUESTION: Why should we divide up, in other\nwords -- there's this amount of the common law action, but\nnot that amount. There's -- why -- how do we know that we\nhave the two-witness rule or the -- or the parol evidence\nrule? I mean, there are lots of controversial things in\ncommon -- in common law actions --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that private people can bring.\nSo, why separate out from that whole package suddenly\npunitive damages? That's --\nMR. ROBBINS: Precisely because this is not a\ncommon law action. This is a Federal statute --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. ROBBINS: -- as to which --\nQUESTION: So, which one shall we separate out?\nJust punitives or what?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, as to which Congress has\nspoken. It has adopted title VI remedies that are quite\nrobust, which come with title VI regulations that are\nenormously detailed, freighted with due -- levels of due\nprocess that are quite unusual. And yet, we propose to\noverlay a punitive damages remedy that comes with none of\nthose protections. It would work an extraordinary anomaly\nto layer punitive damages on a regime like this. This is\nnot, after all, a question that is committed to the courts\nlike some of those doctrines. The parole evidence rule\nmay in some jurisdictions have originally been enacted or\nnot.\nBut the fact is this is a statute, and Congress\nspoke rather clearly to what it -- it wanted the statute\nto accomplish. And some of the things it expressly said\ncannot live with the things that respondent proposes to\nimport into it.\nAnd let me just say one other thing, and I\nnoticed that my white light on, as -- I do want to reserve\nsome time for rebuttal.\nThis is also a Spending Clause statute, and I\nknow this gets back to a -- a threshold issue that both\nYour Honor and Justice Ginsburg suggested perhaps the\nCourt could pretermit. I think it would be a mistake,\ngiven that the task is to construe the statute, to ignore\nthe fact that it was enacted pursuant to a contractual\nregime in which punitive damages historically and for a\nvariety of sensible reasons are especially inappropriate.\nAnd if there are no questions, I -- I would like\nto reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Robbins.\nMr. Garre, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GARRE: The statutes at issue in this case,\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the\nADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which\nare, by their definition, damages in excess of that\nnecessary to make good any wrong done.\nNow, there are several -- both section 504 and\ntitle II derive their remedies expressly from title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, which operates as a\ncondition on the receipt of Federal financial assistance.\nAnd it seems to me that -- to us that there are several\nfacets of the title VI statutory scheme which make it\nparticularly inappropriate to infer a punitive damages\nremedy.\nThe first is, is that title VI, although it's\nsilent with respect to a compensatory remedy, expressly\nprovides for punitive and regulatory measures in the event\nthat the violation of its nondiscrimination provision. In\nparticular, the statute provides for a termination of\nFederal funding, which this Court has itself recognized is\na very severe -- severe remedy that can have a powerful\ndeterrent effect.\nIn addition, the statute authorizes\nadministrative enforcement actions, actions that -- in\nwhich the regulatory agencies, who have responsibility for\nenforcing section 504 and title II, can take remedial\naction, order remedial action, short of funding\ntermination.\nNow, the second aspect of title VI and title VI\nstatutory scheme it seems to us to be quite pertinent is\nthat punitive damages are themselves antithetical to\nSpending Clause legislation like title VI because the\navailability of unbounded punitive damages awards can\nactually have the effect of diverting resources from\nachieving the important objectives of the underlying\nspending programs.\nQUESTION: Tell me. I just can't recall. Have\nwe held that punitive damages are available on the Bivens\naction?\nMR. GARRE: We think the Court addressed that in\npassing in the Carlson v. Green case, and we think that\nthat -- the discussion of punitive damages in that case is\nproperly regarded as -- as dictum in that case. But --\nbut --\nQUESTION: So, do -- do I infer from your --\nfrom your response that it is the position of the\nDepartment that punitive damages should not be awarded in\nBivens cases?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, but there are two distinctions\nbetween Bivens and this case.\nFirst, in the Bivens context, there aren't\nstatutory penal and regulatory measures that can be used\nlike funding termination or administrative enforcement\nactions to take deterrence measures when -- when needed to\ndeter violations.\nAnd second, in the Bivens context, this Court is\ngiving effect to a constitutional tort that it alone has\nrecognized. In -- in this context, the Court is\npurporting to ascertain Congress's intent in enacting\nsection 504 in title II.\nQUESTION: What about 1983? This Court has said\nthat punitive damages are available.\nMR. GARRE: That -- that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And -- and first of all, if I can make two\npoints -- first, in that context, again, there is no\nexpress statutory penal or regulatory measures that\nCongress created to provide deterrence as it did under\ntitle VI, the remedies at issue in this case.\nAnd secondly, what's important, we think, about\nthe Smith case, in which this Court recognized a punitive\ndamages remedy under section 1983 -- is that in that case,\nthe Court didn't start with the presumption that punitive\ndamages were available and simply look to see if Congress\nhad said otherwise. And that's the presumption that the\ncourt of appeals applied in this case.\nInstead, the Court purported to engage in an\ninquiry of Congress's intent and -- and focused on the\nfact that when -- when Congress enacted section 1983, it\nmade very clear that it was adopting a special species of\ntort liability looking to the -- the State common law at\nthe time which provided for punitive damages there. So,\nwe think that the section 1983 case is quite different\nthan this case. The Court --\nQUESTION: But you -- and you rely on the heavy\ngun in statutes like title VI, title IX. That heavy gun\nis so heavy that it's never used. I mean, in the case\nthat we will hear tomorrow, the statement was made, well,\nyes, it would be a drastic sanction to withdraw Federal\nfunds, but in 30 years it hasn't happened.\nMR. GARRE: Well, first of all, it does happen.\nIt happened in the Grove City case that came here, and I\ncould point Your Honor to additional examples in which the\ntermination funding mechanism has been used. Now, to be\nsure, it -- it's an unusual remedy and it's a harsh\nremedy, and simply because it's not used in more cases\ndoesn't mean that it doesn't have a deterrent effect.\nQUESTION: Under the Rehabilitation Act, it has\nbeen used under 504?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. I could point you to -- to one\ncase. It's -- it's not a case cited in the brief. It's a\ncourt of appeals case, Freeman v. Cavassos, 939 F.2d.\n1527, which is one example.\nBut -- but again, the -- the Federal Government\n-- Congress gave the Federal Government and the Federal\nagencies authority to enforce these provisions short of\nfunding termination. The -- the agencies receive\nthousands of complaints each year under title II and\nsection 504. And they investigate those complaints\ncommeasurate with the seriousness of the allegations\nraised in those complaints, and they are successful in\nnegotiating compliance agreements, ranging from informal\nagreements to formal settlement agreements, in which those\nalleged to -- to have engaged in discrimination agree to\ntake corrective measures to eliminate discrimination and,\nin some cases, to pay monetary sums.\nNow, the -- the Federal agencies have entered\ninto more 300 of those agreements under title II alone in\nthe past 8 years. So, there is an administrative process\nin place. It's statutory -- statutorily created by\nCongress, and we think that that process itself counsels\nheavily against judicial inference of punitive damages.\nOr in addition, to return to the -- the Court's\nFranklin case, the Franklin case is grounded on the notion\nthat the Federal courts have the authority to provide a\nremedy when necessary to make good the wrong done. That\nprinciple has no application to and has never been\nextended to punitive damages. It would be a quantum leap\nfor this Court to extend the Franklin principle to\npunitive damages.\nPunitive damages, the Court has recognized, are\nboth quasi-criminal, unpredictable, and at times have a\ndevastating effect. Those characteristics of punitive\ndamages make them uniquely suited for careful legislative\njudgment. Congress in section 504 and title II has not\nmade any legislative judgment that punitive damages should\nbe available, and therefore, this Court should reverse the\ndecision below.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMr. Nelson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents the issue of whether Congress\nforeclosed awards of punitive damages when it enacted the\nrights of action to enforce section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA which together\nprohibit discrimination against people with disabilities\nin the provision of public services.\nThe text, structure, policies, and legislative\nhistory of the ADA disclose no prohibition on the award of\npunitive damages. Absent such a prohibition --\nQUESTION: Well, if -- now that the Eleventh\nAmendment immunity issue is gone, don't we have to deal\nwith City of Newport?\nMR. NELSON: Well, I think the answer to that,\nJustice O'Connor, is no. Had the defendants wished to\npreserve the ability to argue for immunity on City of\nNewport, they were free to do so in the lower courts.\nQUESTION: Well, do you say that we are\nprecluded from considering that authority as we resolve\nthis case?\nMR. NELSON: No, I don't say --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. NELSON: -- you're precluded from it. It's\n-- it's a --\nQUESTION: No. So, are you going to deal with\nit then?\nMR. NELSON: Yes. I -- I do intend to deal with\nthat.\nI'd like to start by dealing with -- with the\nissue of whether there's a punitive damages remedy at all\nbecause I think then the Newport issue really is secondary\nto that.\nAnd the starting point with respect to the\navailability of punitive damages I think has to be this\nCourt's decision in Franklin. And it's useful I think to,\ninstead of looking at -- at arguments about what underlies\nFranklin, to look at what Franklin said. Quote: \"the\ngeneral rule, therefore, is that absent clear direction to\nthe contrary by Congress, the Federal courts have the\npower to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable\ncause of action brought pursuant to a Federal statute.\"\nQUESTION: Franklin wasn't dealing with punitive\ndamages, was it?\nMR. NELSON: That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.\nPunitive damage was -- was not the form of relief that was\nbeing addressed in Franklin.\nQUESTION: And appropriate relief does not sound\nto me to be consistent with your beginning premise which\nwas that unless Congress forecloses the remedy, we must\ngive it.\nMR. NELSON: Well, I certainly don't mean to say\nthat -- that in any particular case, the Court must give\nit unless Congress forecloses it, but if Congress has not\nforeclosed it, it's potentially available if, in view of\nthe policies of -- of the particular statute, it's an\nappropriate remedy and in view of the conduct that's being\naddressed. Specifically, under this Court's decisions,\npunitive damages are an appropriate remedy where there's\nwillful -- a willful violation or reckless disregard of --\nof the legal entitlements of the plaintiff.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you make of the -- the\nargument that the whole touchstone for damages here is\n504, which is essentially the -- the spending power -- the\n-- the -- a statute resting on the spending power? The\nclosest analogy to that is with contract, and you don't\nget punitive damages from contract.\nMR. NELSON: Well, there -- there are two\nanswers to that. The first is that the touchstone is not\nsimply 504, but also the ADA, which is not a Spending\nClause enactment at all. The second is that --\nQUESTION: But that referred to 504 for -- for\n-- in effect, for its remedial scheme.\nMR. NELSON: To the extent that -- that what it\n-- what it says is that the remedies available, the\nremedies being a private right of action -- and that does\nnot necessarily, however, import a limitation imposed on\nthat remedy from above by the Spending Clause that doesn't\ninhere in the -- in the nature of the statute itself,\nassuming that the Spending Clause does impose that\nlimitation, which I don't concede, and I'll get to in a\nmoment.\nBut this Court actually addressed a similar\nsituation in the Darrone case. The issue there was the\nremedies available under section 504 for a case of\nemployment discrimination, and 504 in turn incorporates\nthe remedies available under title VI. Title VI said\nthere is no remedy available for employment discrimination\nunder title VI except with regard to a Federal program\nwhere the funding is for employment purposes. This Court\nsaid that by incorporating the title VI remedies, section\n504 did not incorporate that limitation on the remedial\nscheme that had nothing to do with the policies underlying\nsection 504 which were to eliminate discrimination against\nthe handicapped more broadly.\nSimilarly, under the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, the -- the purpose of that act is to extend even\nfurther than 504 the prohibition on and the remedies for\ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities. And to\nimport into that statutory scheme a limit on relief that\n-- that would pull it back and -- and restrict it to\nwhat's appropriate on a Spending Clause measure would be\ninappropriate under, I think, the mode of analysis this\nCourt used in Darrone.\nBut in any event, even if one looks only at\nsection 504, the Spending Clause analogy to contract\ndoesn't limit remedies available to contractual remedies.\nThis Court I think made clear, both in Franklin and then\nmore recently in Davis v. Monroe County, that although the\nobligation that an entity may undertake under the Spending\nClause is contractual in the sense that it's voluntary and\nit has to be clearly stated what the substantive\nrequirements you're subjecting yourself to when you accept\nFederal funding are, that that does not carry with it the\nnotion that you're limited to a, quote, \"contract\" remedy.\nIn Davis, what the plaintiff sought in her\ncomplaint was punitive and compensatory damages for\ninjuries that had been inflicted on her. She, of course,\nwas not a party to any contract. What she was seeking was\nquintessentially a tort recovery, and this Court held in\nDavis that as long as the requirement that the conduct was\nintentional, it was a violation that was -- that -- that a\nperson in authority had knowledge of and had -- had\nallowed the situation to go forward, that if those\nconditions, which were Spending Clause conditions under\nthe Gebser decision -- if those conditions were met, you\ncould go forward and obtain the type of tort remedial\nrelief that the plaintiff was --\nQUESTION: Well, you say -- you say she wasn't a\nparty to the contract. She -- she was a beneficiary of\nthe contract, surely. I mean --\nMR. NELSON: Well, you could, I suppose,\nanalogize her to a third party beneficiary, but to suggest\nthat --\nQUESTION: And contract actions were original\ntort actions. It's easy to characterize a contract action\nas a tort action. Right? It's just assumpsit.\nMR. NELSON: Well, and in fact --\nQUESTION: I -- I'm not sure a whole lot hangs\non --\nMR. NELSON: -- that -- that argument can go the\nother way, too, because the States are broadly recognizing\nthat -- that malicious and bad faith breaches of contract\ncarry with them tort remedies.\nBut I'll give another example. This Court in a\ncouple of decisions, Wright v. Roanoke Housing Authority,\nand Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, held that\nunder Spending Clause enactments, obligations can be\nimposed on the recipients of funds that are enforceable\nthat create enforceable rights under section 1983.\nAnd this Court has repeatedly held, most\nrecently I think in City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes,\nthat 1983 is ever and always a tort remedy.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Nelson, why don't we look\nspecifically at this context, which is the ADA, and the\nanomaly that when Congress thought about punitive damages,\nas we know it did in the employment part, it provided for\nthem with qualifications and with caps on amount. So, it\nwould be passing strange, would it not, that when Congress\nis explicit about punitive damages, it contains them, and\nit when it says not one word one way or another, they are\nunlimited because that's -- as I take your argument to be,\nunder part 3, there are the caps and the qualifications,\nbut under part 2, it's public service, no limitation.\nMR. NELSON: It's under title I that the caps\napply, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that what that\nillustrates is not -- not the point that -- that Congress\ndidn't intend to provide these remedies. You have to look\nat -- at the timing of the enactments and the background\nof those changes to the -- in the Civil Rights Act of\n1991.\nAs the ADA was originally enacted, title I,\nconsonant with title VII, didn't provide a damages remedy\nof any kind. It didn't provide an entitlement to any\nlegal forms of relief. It was limited to equitable relief\nfollowing the -- the title VII model.\nNo such limitation has ever been placed on title\nII. In title II, Congress simply incorporated by\nreference an action for legal remedies that this Court had\nalready recognized to exist.\nNow, then in 1991, Congress expanded the relief\nunder title I of the ADA, as well as under title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act for the first time ever to allow a\ndamages remedy, either compensatory or punitive, for\nemployment discrimination to which those statutes applied.\nAnd what that illustrates is simply the history\nthat Congress has been very wary about providing broad\ndamages remedies in the employment discrimination area and\nin 1981, it relaxed that unwillingness to some degree, but\nthen placed a cap on it. But in title II, it's quite\nclear, from the original 1990 legislation, that Congress\ndidn't impose that circumscribed set of employment\ndiscrimination remedies on title II. So, by expanding\ntitle I, that doesn't either limit title II or imply that\ntitle II was ever intended to be limited.\nQUESTION: Am I right that title III says no\npunitive damages?\nMR. NELSON: Title III says no punitive damages\nat all as part of a -- of a remedial scheme that is\nsimilarly circumscribed to -- to title I, although in\nsomewhat different ways, a remedial scheme that under\ntitle III doesn't make a private right of action for\ndamages of any kind available to an individual plaintiff.\nUnder title III, it's only the Attorney General who can\never sue for any damages, and then when Congress -- it --\nhaving made a -- a damages remedy available to the\nAttorney General, it then went on to say, and under this\nstatute, damages doesn't include punitive damages.\nI think to the extent that sheds any light on\ntitle II at all, we know that in title II, Congress knew\nthat it was creating a damages remedy. That it didn't\nlimit those damages, as it did in title III, when it\ncreated that limited damages remedy through the Attorney\nGeneral, is, if anything, an indication that no limitation\nwas intended.\nQUESTION: Why? Why? Because -- why -- why\nwould somebody want to -- title II has to do with actions\nagainst a government basically, doesn't it?\nMR. NELSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So -- so, I thought punitives are\nprimarily designed to compensate an individual who's not\ngoing to be compensated. It's just a way of wielding a\nvery big club against the people who behaved badly.\nMR. NELSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, why would you want that big club\nto be wielded against private people in limited amounts,\nbut when you get to a government which, after all,\nrepresents the entire public, you say the sky is the\nlimit? Newport would suggest where the government is\ninvolved it's less reasonable to assess punitives than\nwhere a private individual is.\nMR. NELSON: Well, I think the -- part of the\nanswer to that is the whole structure of the ADA remedial\nscheme indicates an intention to make broader remedies\navailable against public entities than private entities to\nbegin with. That's why, when the ADA was originally\nenacted, there were all these limits placed on title III,\nno compensatory damages even, limits on title I against\nprivate and public employers, not even any compensatory\ndamages. Clearly, in title II, everyone agrees that\nCongress made available a remedy there that is much more\nextensive than it made against private employers or\nprivate offerors of public accommodations.\nNow, why Congress did that I think is -- is\nperhaps somewhat obscure, but it seems to relate back to\nthe entire history, starting with the 1964 Civil Rights\nAct, where Congress was very hesitant about imposing broad\nremedies against private actors, possibly in part due to\nthe -- the effectiveness of their lobbyists, which --\nwhich may have been greater in this instance than those of\n-- of public employers and entities.\nBut for whatever reason Congress did it, it's\nclear that Congress did enact broader remedies under title\nII than under those titles that are applicable to --\nQUESTION: But that's an anomaly too because in\ntitle -- title III, which is the -- the title that imposes\n-- title I is the one -- employment. Right?\nMR. NELSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: And are government employers liable\nfor punitive damages under title I?\nMR. NELSON: No, they are not.\nQUESTION: So, your -- your notion that -- that\nthe government is not well representative in the\nlegislature -- here is a title that says, private sector,\nyou're going to be stuck. You're going to be subject to\npunitive damages, but not government entities.\nMR. NELSON: Well, that -- that was -- that was\nwhat happened in the 1991 round. Presumably the -- the\nCongress there obviously did made -- make a considered\nchoice not to impose those remedies on -- on public\nactors.\nBut I think, you know, to step back even\nfurther, one has to look at the fact that both section\n504, by virtue of the 1986 Rehabilitation Act amendments,\nand the ADA, by virtue of -- of section 502, are subject\nas a general rule to the principle that -- that Congress\nvery deliberately said public entities, and in particular\nStates, are going to be subject to the full range of\nremedies that are available against private defendants.\nCongress did that explicitly in both those -- both those\nstatutes.\nAnd I think what that indicates is that there\nhas been a considered judgment in these statutes that,\nespecially in the area of the provision of public\nservices, Congress wants broad remedies to be made\navailable against the public entities that are subject to\nit. It's true that Congress made a different judgment in\n1991 when it extended the -- the remedies for employment\ndiscrimination. But except for that provision of the\nstatute where public employers were given a special\nexemption, the rest of the statute evinces an -- an\nintention by Congress that public entities not get special\nexemptions.\nQUESTION: But doesn't that seem rather\nperverse?\nMR. NELSON: Well, I think it -- it seems -- it\nseems to me that -- that one can look at it either way.\nIt's perverse if you're a public entity; it's not perverse\nif you're a business entity that feels like anti-\ndiscrimination laws trench on the -- the freedom of\nbusinesses to operate in the way they want to operate.\nI think what Congress has done with respect to\ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities, first in\nmaking the 504 remedies available against recipients of\nFederal funds, and then in making the title II remedies\navailable against public entities, is -- is Congress has\nmade a judgment that says, we think discrimination against\npersons with disabilities is particularly objectionable\nwhen engaged in by the government, just as in the\nfourth --\nQUESTION: But -- but your -- your Newport case\ncertainly suggests that traditionally public entities are\ntreated differently than private entities for the same\nconduct if you're talking about punitive damages.\nMR. NELSON: That's certainly true. And -- and\nwhat I think is distinctive about Newport, to begin with,\nhere I do believe that -- that if the Court were to\nconsidered that under these statutes there is a punitive\ndamages remedy available generally, and then the question\nis should these particular defendants be freed from it\nunder a City of Newport rationale, that -- that it's fair\nfor this Court to hold the -- the defendant to the rule\nthat it generally applies, which is that if you want to\nargue something like that, raise an issue like that, you\nshould do it in the lower courts.\nBut even looking beyond that, what we have in --\nin these statutes is in the --\nQUESTION: About the issue, are you -- are you\nsuggesting that it is not included in the question\npresented?\nMR. NELSON: No, I'm not making that argument.\nQUESTION: Then -- then did you in your brief in\nopposition point out that this was not properly raised in\nthe lower courts?\nMR. NELSON: Yes, that was pointed out in the\nbrief in opposition.\nQUESTION: I want to be sure you -- suppose that\nwe did look at the Newport issue. I'm not saying that we\nshould, but suppose we did. And suppose that you lost on\nyour point that it should be waived or deemed waived.\nWhat would your -- is there any response to their claim on\nthe merits that -- that Newport makes clear that they are\nnot liable in punitive damages?\nMR. NELSON: Yes. I think -- I think that --\nthat the first response is that through the Rehabilitation\nAct amendments of 1986, which are codified at 42 U.S.C.,\nsection 2000(d)(7), and also in section 502 of the ADA,\nwhich is codified at 42 U.S.C., section 12202, those\nprovisions are fundamentally incompatible with the notion\nof Newport immunity.\nAnd I want to just start by expressing my\nunderstanding of what Newport immunity is in light of this\nCourt's decision in -- in the Vermont Natural Resources\ncase. It's not specifically an immunity that is municipal\nimmunity. It's an immunity or a -- or a general\npresumption against awards of punitive damages against\nState and local governments as a class. And -- and what\nit says where it operates is that those defendants as a\nclass have an exemption against a particular form of\nrelief that is otherwise available against private actors.\nIn the Rehabilitation Act amendments and in\nsection 502 of the ADA, what Congress said expressly is\nthat as to remedies against States, which are one of the\nentities entitled to the Newport presumption, they're\nsubject to the same remedies under the statutes as are any\nother private or public entities, meaning if you can get\nit against a private entity, you can get it against a\nState. And that takes away the fundamental premise of\nNewport, which is that governmental entities as a class\nare entitled to a special exemption. What these statutes\nsay is that governmental entities as a class are entitled\nto no special exemption. And the City of Newport issue I\nthink simply goes away.\nI'd also suggest that one of the fundamental\npremises of City of Newport is not present under these\nstatutes, and that is that there's an adequate alternative\ndeterrent. And -- and in this case, what we're talking\nabout when we're talking about punitive damages as a\ndeterrent, to answer Justice Kennedy's question earlier of\nMr. Robbins, in this case the compensatory damages award\ndid include pain, suffering, humiliation, and mental\ndamages. So, we're not talking about punitive damages\nhere as a surrogate for some component of compensatories.\nWe're talking about it as a remedy designed to provide a\ndeterrent that will assist in -- in Congress's goal of\neliminating discrimination against persons with\ndisabilities.\nAnd in -- in Newport, this Court looked at the\n1983 remedy and said, yes, punitive damages are an\nimportant element of deterrence with respect to civil\nrights violations that are subject to section 1983. But\nwe have a better deterrent which is the availability of\npunitive damages against individual defendants who\nactually make the decisions to carry out the -- the\nwrongful acts that 1983 is responding to. Now, whether\nthat judgment is -- as to which is more effective, is\ncorrect or not, that's the line the Court drew in Newport.\nBut under these statutes, that remedy is not\navailable because section 504 and title II of the ADA make\nquite clear that they provide remedies only against the\nentities. There's no right of action against a -- an\nindividual under title II of the ADA or under section 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act. So, with respect to these\nstatutes, deterrence against the entity is all you've got\nand all you can rely on.\nAnd that's yet another reason why Newport's\npolicies are inapplicable here. And Newport was very\nclear that beyond looking at the immunity, as -- as it\nused the term, of municipalities as a -- as a sort of\nstandard to try to determine what the legislature was\nthinking about when it enacted the statute, the Court was\nalso going to look at the policies of the particular\nstatutes to determine whether or not immunity from\npunitive damages accorded with those policies. And given\nthe distinctions between the ADA and section 504, those\npolicies are not served here by immunizing the -- the\ndefendants against punitive damages on -- under a Newport\nrationale.\nI'd also like to get back for a moment, if I\ncould, to the -- the notion that what's going on in\nFranklin is limited to compensatory remedies and that --\nthat the idea of -- of punitive damages as one of the\nnormal modes of relief offered by the Federal courts is\nnot really what the Court was talking about in Franklin.\nI think that's inconsistent not only with Bivens where in\nCarlson v. Green this Court, I think, held that punitive\ndamages are available in Bivens actions because, as one of\nthe ordinary remedial mechanisms available to the Federal\ncourts, they were particularly appropriate for the redress\nof constitutional violations.\nThe reason I say that that's a holding is the\nissue in Carlson was not whether there was a -- a right of\naction for any relief at all under the Eighth Amendment.\nIt was conceded that -- that the plaintiff could get\ninjunctive relief against an Eighth Amendment violation if\nthere was a pervasive --\nQUESTION: Mr. Nelson, last year in -- in the\nAlexander case and this year in the Malesko case, we've\nindicated that we're taking a much more critical look, I\nthink, at these kind of claims than we ever did in\nCarlson.\nMR. NELSON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nthink that that's -- that that's quite right with respect\nto -- with respect to the evolution of this Court's\ndoctrine. I think what the Court said, in -- in\nparticular in Sandoval, was that -- that the Court had\nbacked away from the notion that for every right, there\nhas to be a remedy and had gone to the -- the Court v. Ash\nnotion, that what we're looking for when we're trying to\ndetermine whether a right of action exists is\ncongressional intent.\nBut that was true at the time of -- of Franklin\nas well and the Court in Franklin said that's a separate\nquestion from what relief you get when it's conceded that\nthere is a right of action to begin with.\nAnd similarly, in Malesko, this Court said,\nwe're not going to recognize a right of action against\nthis particular entity. The question, when it's clear\nthat Congress has made a right of action available, as it\nis here, and what form of relief is appropriate, is a\ndifferent matter.\nQUESTION: Well, but what -- what you're arguing\nbasically is that every one of these things is fixed in\ntime permanently not just as to its holding, but as -- as\nto language in it. And what I'm trying to suggest is that\nthat is not always necessarily so, that the Court may take\na slightly different view some -- now than it did 10 years\nago.\nMR. NELSON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nthat's clearly -- that's clearly true. And the question\nthat -- that we as -- as lawyers are trying to -- to deal\nwith is -- is how, in light of changes in precedent and --\nand changes in evolution of the Court's doctrine over\ntime, what aspects can we pull out and -- and hold\nconstant or -- or use to make arguments as to what the\nrule remains.\nAnd to me, looking at Franklin, which was a case\nthat -- first of all, all nine Justices concurred in the\nholding at the time. Second, it came at a point where\nthis Court had already evolved far away from the every\nright must have a remedy doctrine and was looking very\nspecifically at whether or not Congress had intended to\nallow a right of action. But what the opinion for the\nCourt said and even the concurrence said was when it's\ncrystal clear that Congress said there's a right of action\nhere, does -- do we infer limits on our ability to provide\nappropriate relief when Congress hasn't given us guidance\non that subject?\nQUESTION: And didn't say anything about whether\npunitives would be appropriate relief because all Franklin\ninvolved was compensatory damages. Before that, it was\nthought that there were no compensatory damages under\nspending statutes. To clarify that, they used the phrase\nappropriate relief. So, we've never had any holding that\nunder Franklin punitive damages would be appropriate.\nMR. NELSON: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nOn the other hand, the Court has certainly held that\npunitive damages are appropriate in implied statutory\nrights of action, the most notable being section 1981\nwhich, unlike section 1983, is an implied right of action.\nSection 1981 doesn't say anything about creating a right\nfor anybody to go in and get enforcement, and the Court\nhas held not only is there a right of action there, but\nheld as recently as the Pollard case, which I believe was\nlast year, that under 1981 the scope of relief includes\npunitive damages.\nI think that what that reflects is the Franklin\nprinciple, that when there's a cause of action, when it's\na cause of action such as these, that is, essentially a\ntort remedy, that the traditional range of relief that's\nappropriate for such rights is provided. And that range\nof relief includes punitive damages.\nAnd -- and again, the issue in this case is not\nwhether on the facts punitive damages are appropriate,\nbecause that hasn't yet been decided, but whether ever\npunitive damages are appropriate under this statute. And\nI think Franklin speaks to the question not in its express\nholding but its rationale which -- which I believe has\nsurvived down to the present.\nUnless there are any further questions, I will\nleave it at that.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Nelson.\nMr. Robbins, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me turn -- go back for just a moment to the\n1991 act because I think its -- its significance here is\nterribly important and quite a bit different from\nrespondent's characterization.\nThe 1991 act amended title I of the ADA and also\nthe Rehabilitation Act to provide a capped punitive\ndamages remedy available only to -- only to\nnongovernmental entities. This case obviously involves an\nuncapped award, indeed an award four times the size of the\ncap, applied only to governmental entities and not in an\nemployment setting. That's more than simply anomalous.\nIt is, I think, completely implausible for reasons that I\nthink go beyond what -- what Mr. Nelson has described to\nyou.\nThe fact is title I was enacted in its original\nform at the very same time that Congress was considering\nthe 1991 legislation. Everyone in Congress knew that when\nthey enacted in title I that there shall be the same\nremedies as title VII -- everyone knew that at that very\nmoment laying before another committee in Congress was the\nvery legislation that is being characterized as the 1991\nlegislation, as if it happened much later. These happened\nsimultaneously and everyone knew that punitive damages\nwere around the corner. In my view, when you look at what\nMr. Nelson called the timing of the enactments, you really\nhave to read title I as if it enacted a punitive damages\nand capped and targeted and calibrated.\nTitle III also has a penalty provision.\nAlthough it forbids punitive damages, to go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, it has a civil penalties\nprovision. So, the thing that is remarkable about\nrespondent's position and the position you would be urged\nto adopt is that although title I of the ADA has a limited\npunitive damages provision applicable only to employment\ncases and exempting the government, and although title III\nhas a civil penalties provision applicable only to public\naccommodations, title II, which is silent, shall have an\nunlimited punitive damages provision which can be applied\nagainst governmental entities. And it is against\ngovernmental entities and only governmental entities that\ntitle II applies.\nAnd City of Newport, I should add, doesn't\nchange just how anomalous that is. The Rehabilitation Act\namendments go not one step in the direction of overturning\nCity of Newport. The Rehabilitation Act amendments say\nonly this, that the States shall be liable for whatever\nremedies are applicable to other public entities or\nprivate entities. It doesn't tell us what those shall be,\nand in our view punitive damages aren't available against\nanybody under title II. So, it -- it hardly advances\nrespondent's position to say that there shall be\napplicable to the States whatever is applicable to anyone\nelse.\nThe other thing is, what are those other public\nentities if not, among other things, municipal governments\nlike my client? By carving out, in other words, municipal\ngovernments, the 1986 amendment is a very strange way to\noverrule the doctrine in -- in City of Newport, and I\nwould respectfully suggest that it does no such thing.\nLet me -- let me end with this point. And we\nhaven't -- we haven't mentioned the history of judicial\ninterpretation of title VI and section 504, which had\nnever -- never, not once -- ever been construed to permit\npunitive damages at any of the times in history that these\nstatutes were meticulously amended and -- and previous\nremedy provisions incorporated going forward.\nBut I do want to end with where Mr. Nelson\nbegan.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Robbins.\nMR. ROBBINS: Perhaps not.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You've already ended.\n(Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n18:14,22 23:7 28:1,5 29:7 alleged
