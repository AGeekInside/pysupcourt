        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'll repeat myself. I\ndidn't have the mike on. The Court will hear argument\nin Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc., against Snohomish\nPublic Utility District No. 1, or Public District --\nSnohomish County No. 1.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in\nthis case reasonably denied Respondent's request to\nmodify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power\ncompanies had entered into in 2000 and 2001. The\nCommission reasonably concluded that Respondents had not\nmade the requisite showing under the Federal Power Act\nand under this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra\nthat modification of the contracts was necessary in the\npublic interest.\nIn reaching that conclusion, FERC first drew\non three factors that this Court had identified in\nSierra and found that they were not satisfied. Thus, it\nfound that Respondents had failed to show that the\ncontracts would impose financial strain on the\npurchasing companies; that it would impose excessive\nburdens on the customers; or that they were unduly\ndiscriminatory. But FERC also looked --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But FERC thought it could\nlive with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the\ngovernment recommended that we deny cert in this case;\nisn't that so?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is -- that is correct,\nand FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be\nlimited to the circumstances arising out of the\nCalifornia energy crisis in the years 2000- 2001, and\nthat it could channel its concerns about contract\nstability through those other factors.\nBut, nonetheless, FERC believes, as its\ndecisions make clear and as our position in this Court\nmakes clear, that the Ninth Circuit's reformulation of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine or interpretation of the act\nwas incorrect. And, now that the Court has granted\nreview, we urge affirmance of FERC's decision in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it clear to the\ngovernment that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about\n10 percent of the country, was going to continue this\ninterpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of\nany consequence to FERC or to the government?\nMR. GARRE: It was of consequence, but FERC\nstill believed it had some interpretive authority after\nthe decision. Maybe this was a wrong judgment at the\ntime, but FERC thought that it still had some\ninterpretive authority under the decision, and that it\ncould --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, this\nis a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers\nFERC. FERC says: Oh, we don't have that authority.\nAnd the Ninth Circuit said: Yes, you do. So this is an\nagency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit\nsays it can. And why can it not? Because of two\ndecisions of this Court. Is that right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, two decisions of this\nCourt and 50 years of intervening FERC, before that\nFederal Power Commission, practice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, wait, wait. It\ndidn't just say the agency may do it. It said the\nagency must do it. I don't -- I don't consider \"must\"\nto be an empowerment. I consider that to be a\ndirection.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. That -- that is\ncorrect. I mean it, I think -- I took the question to\nbe that it might give FERC broader flexibility, but at a\nvery substantial cost to the stability of contracts,\nwhich was the underlying point that this Court stressed\nin its decision in Sierra: That the Federal Power Act,\nunlike -- and the Natural Gas Act, unlike the Interstate\nCommerce Act, contemplates that rates will be set by\ncontract, or at least can be set by contract; and that\ntherefore, like in most situations, a party to a\ncontract cannot unilaterally walk away from that\ncontract or insist upon its modification because it may\nbecome disadvantageous over time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- let's go\nback a step. I thought FERC's position was: We could\nnot decide as a matter of discretion to do this because\nwe are limited by those Supreme Court decisions.\nMR. GARRE: Well, FERC --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not what FERC --\nFERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the\nconclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the\nNinth Circuit did. It's FERC saying: We can't do that\nbecause we have our marching orders from the Supreme\nCourt.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I think -- I mean there\nare -- there are two interpretive questions here: When\ndoes the public interest standard identified in this\nCourt's decisions in Mobile and Sierra apply? And then\nthere is the further question of what is necessary to\nsatisfy the public interest standard for modifying a\ncontract.\nWe think on both points the Commission's\ndecision in this case reflects an interpretive judgment\nthat the Court's decision, or the interpretation\nreflected in the Court's decision, in Sierra applies\nequally in the market-based rate system without any of\nthe -- either of the two prerequisites that the Ninth\nCircuit formulated as a precondition to applying the\npublic interest standard.\nAnd I would point the Court's attention, in\nthe joint appendix in the Commission's decision, to\njoint appendix 1244 and 1245, repeated again at 1572 and\n1573; and also the passage quoted in the Morgan Stanley\nbrief at page 17, reflects a determination of what the\nCommission's longstanding policy has been that,\ncontracts once entered into, their integrity must be\nprotected and should not be lightly set aside.\nAnd also, the Commission specifically\nrejected at pages 1564 and 1565 of the joint appendix\nthe prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit came up with in\nthis case, that there must be an opportunity to\ndetermine whether the rates were within a zone of just\nand reasonableness at the time the contracts were\nentered into in order for Mobile and Sierra to apply.\nUnder a market-based rate system, what FERC\ndoes is determine at the outset when an applicant\napplies for a market-based tariff whether that company\nhas market power and if so, whether it's mitigated.\nOnly in those circumstances is the company granted the\nauthority to market -- to set prices by the market.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What happens if that\napproval is given and then a seller enters into\ncontracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary\nto what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the\nseller has exercised market power or has otherwise\nmanipulated the market? Is there any remedy in that\nsituation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, what the Commission\ndetermined in this case is that there was -- there was\nno manipulation or exercise of market power identified\nwith respect to these specific contracts. And what the\nCommission decided was that the importance of the\nintegrity of contracts in that circumstance required\nthat the contract be maintained. If the Respondents had\nshown bad faith or something like that in the\nconnection -- or fraud in connection with the formation\nof these particular contracts, that would have been\nquite a different matter.\nIt's also important to note that the\nCommission found in this case that there was no\ndysfunction in the forward market, which is what we have\nhere. What was going on is that there was dysfunction\nin the spot market in 2000, 2001 for a variety of\nreasons, some of them going to market fundamentals such\nas a shortage of generation capacity, a shortage of\nhydropower.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so I understand your\nanswer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has\nretroactive authority to alter the permission to engage\nin these contracts only if there is fraud --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No it can -- I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or something similar?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Once it has granted\nmarket-based rate authority, FERC can revoke that. And\nin fact, companies -- there is a triennial review of\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Retroactive?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Retroactively?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. It would be revoked --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito's\nquestion, I think as I understood it, or at least a\nquestion in my mind that followed upon it, was whether\nor not -- what's the basis for any retroactive\nrevocation of that or --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it wouldn't be\nretroactive. It would be from the date of the complaint\nthat was filed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be a public\ninterest finding, a finding that because of the market\nmanipulation by the seller that affected this very\ncontract, the public interest demands that we not hold\nthe --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In that situation there\nis an important public interest in eliminating fraud.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't say fraud. I said\nmarket manipulation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Or market manipulation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the remedy for the\nfinding of market manipulation the abrogation of the\ncontract, which is a separate process from, from the\nrevocation of market-based tariff?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There are. And this is the\npoint I was going to make --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The same reason may support\neach, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. I was going to make\nthat point in response to Justice Kennedy's question.\nIf it turns out that subsequent evidence shows that a\nparticular company has acquired market-based power, then\nFERC can revoke that authority on a going-forward basis\nto continue to sell on that basis. And in fact,\ncompanies are required to report any changes in their\ncircumstances that might affect their market power, and\nthere is a triennial review of that. But as long ago\nthe market --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the companies who\nwere involved in this case make those reports? I mean,\nthere was something about during this energy crisis\nthere was rampant noncompliance with the filing, with\nthe quarterly report filing.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was, and the Ninth\nCircuit found that in the Lockyer decision. But that is\nthe sort of flaw and market oversight that should be\naddressed directly by FERC. It shouldn't be -- it\nshouldn't be addressed by collateral attacks on\ncontracts that were entered into under the regulatory\nregime as it existed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I'm not\nentirely understanding you. Why should the fact that\nthe seller later acquired market power have anything to\ndo with whether the initial contract, when he did not\nhave market power, was a fair one? The contracts are\nalready down in black and white, his later acquisition\nof market power cannot affect --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that is certainly\ncorrect. I think the question, what concerned the Ninth\nCircuit -- actually, the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing\nmarket power. It was addressing the possibility of\nmarket dysfunction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But later\nacquisition of market power would result in a\ncancellation of the permission for this particular firm\nto enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see\nwhy it would affect the past contracts.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And we don't think it should,\nexcept to the extent the public interest standard is\nmet.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I think I led us into\nthis, Mr. Kneedler. The situation that I was positing\nwas a situation in which the power marketer had engaged\nin market manipulation in the context of which, at the\ntime of which, it made this contract. And my suggestion\nto you, which I think you took, was that in a situation\nlike that there would be a basis for public interest\nreview and abrogation of this contract because of the\nmarket manipulation in fact.\nAnd the market manipulation would also be a\nreason to say market power had been acquired. It had\nnot been mitigated, and hence, the market-based tariff\nauthority would also be revoked. And that was the, that\nwas the limit of my question. And I take it your answer\nthere is it could do each of those things?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It could revoke the\nmarket-based power going forward. And with respect to\nmanipulation, especially if there was manipulation\naffecting the particular contract, that would be a basis\nfor finding that the public interest required the\ncontract to be modified.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of\nmy time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, I do have\none question. It was the position that FERC took in\nDecember of 2000, when it was encouraging the entrance\ninto the long-term contracts rather than using the spot\nmarket, and in that order FERC said that it would\nmonitor long-term contracts vigorously for rate\nreasonableness and that buyers could challenge rates\nthrough 206 proceedings. What happened to that\nposition?\nMR. KNEEDLER: This is such a challenge, but\nwhat FERC has concluded is that the public interest\nstandard has to be satisfied in that situation. FERC\nencouraged parties to go into the long-term market in\norder to diminish the market volatility and it would\nfrustrate that encouragement of policy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how did FERC monitor\nthe rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was extensive staff\nstudies and monitoring in subsequent decisions that are,\nthat are shown and that are in the joint appendix, in\nApril -- in January and April and June when FERC came up\nwith its final program to mitigate the problems in the\nspot market.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Stevens, good\nmorning, and may it please the Court:\nJustice Ginsburg began by asking whether the\nNinth Circuit decision did not in fact empower rather\nthan restrict the authority of the Commission. The\nanswer is that the Ninth Circuit decision fundamentally\nprecludes the Commission from carrying out what the\nCommission believes is essential to its mandate to\nassure an abundancy of electrical energy at the lowest\npossible cost. And that is to encourage a market-based\napproach to recognize that if you're going to have, as\nthe Commission has said, the kind of investment in the\nbuilding of infrastructure to produce energy, people are\ngoing to have to be able to rely upon long-term\ncontracts.\nIn this case, what the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision did is to take away a very important option\nthat the Commission believes is essential in times of\nmarket volatility and dysfunction. And that is the\noption for parties to get out of the spot market and to\nenter into a long-term contract of a secure supply.\nIf the Ninth Circuit's decision stood,\nliterally parties, buyers and sellers, would both be\nprecluded from entering into that, because you would\nknow if there were dysfunction that nothing you could\nsay in the contract could mean that you could buy power\nfor the next eight years at $105 at a time, as was the\ncase here, when the spot market was $300. It would take\naway the option. And sellers would know they couldn't\nenter into a contract they could rely upon subject only\nto being overridden in the public interest, which FERC\ndoes. And that would be very damaging to the very\nprocesses which the Commission has used consistent with\nthis Court's decision of 50 years ago to encourage\ndevelopment in this industry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, those decisions are\npuzzling transposed to this setting, because in those\ndecisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain;\nthe price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out,\nright?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And now we are\ntransposing that. And one of the main themes I think of\nJustice Harlan's decision was this Act was meant to\nprotect the consumer, to make sure that the consumer\nwasn't going to be overcharged. And that runs through\nthose two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no\nmarket-based authority, or any such, right?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, yes. Justice\nGinsburg, that is correct. That was a case where a\nseller was seeking to get out of a contract that was\npaying too low.\nBut the fundamental purpose -- the Court\nrecognized even in Justice Harlan's opinion that\nmaintaining the stability and expectation of contracts\nwas going to be important to consumers, to buyers as\nwell as to sellers. In this -- and FERC has adopted\nthat position.\nIn this case you have a situation where the\nCommission decided that instability in the spot markets\nwas being partly caused by the fact that the State\nregulatory process had discouraged people from entering\ninto longer term contracts; and FERC said in its 2000\nSan Diego order, we strongly urge utilities to move\ntheir load to long-term contracts of two years or more.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the same order\nwhere they said we are going to monitor the rates for\nreasonableness.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is true. And when they\ndid indeed undertake a review of this, they decided that\nwith respect to these contracts there was no evidence of\nbad faith. There was no evidence of unfairness. There\nwas no evidence of duress. There was no evidence of any\nmarket manipulation that affected the contracts\nspecifically in these long-term cases.\nThe long-term contracts were part of the\nsolution or the mitigation of the problem. It was a\nlong-term contract that allowed the utilities in this\ncase to get out from under $300 a megawatt prices and to\nenter into a contract at $105, in one of the cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask this question?\nAssuming there is absolutely no bad faith or fraud or\nanything like that, but there is just a general\nconclusion that the market was such -- in such turmoil\nthat there could not be made reasonable or long-term\ncontracts, because the predicate for that kind of\nnegotiation just didn't exist. Would that be a basis\nfor setting aside the contract?\nMR. DELLINGER: No; and it's very important\nthat not be a basis, because if that were the case,\nparties would know and parties -- both -- all parties\nwere aware that there was volatility, and the Commission\nhad announced that the conditions were conducive to\nmanipulation of the spot markets. That would mean that\na seller would say to a buyer, we know you would like to\nget out of this volatility and get a regular supply\nguaranteed at a -- at a much lower price for long term.\nWe can't enter into that contract, because the fact that\nwe know there has been this problem in the market means\nthat our contract won't be upheld.\nNow, the Ninth Circuit decision says that\ncontract terms are not binding if they were influenced\nby a dysfunctional market; and that is the very most\nimportant circumstance in which having long-term\ncontracting is most valuable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is volatile the same as\ndysfunctional?\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Kennedy, I don't\nknow precisely what the Ninth Circuit means by\ndysfunctional. There is volatility. I think the\ndifference would be is there manipulation, is one\nfactor; there were a number of factors that caused the\nvolatility here --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger, does that\nmean that it is your position that no matter how\ndysfunctional the market was, just complete turmoil, as\nlong as the contract was made in good faith without any\nfraud or abuse of power, it's a binding contract?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct, unless --\nand this is an important unless -- the Commission\nreviews those contract terms and finds that the public\ninterest necessitates a revision of the contract. They\nhave that discretion. They have that authority. They\nare prepared to and have exercised it, but in -- in this\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For example --\nMR. DELLINGER: For example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For example, if the prices\ndown the road turn out to be so high for the utility,\nthat the utility would go out of business?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is an example that the\nCourt gave in Mobile and -- and Sierra. But the\nCourt -- but what the Commission would know is that the\ncircumstances would have to be rather extraordinary.\nBecause whenever you were to modify the terms of a\ncontract that the sellers have been relying upon, the\nsellers became buyers. They also went out on the\nmarket. They are buying and selling.\nSo unraveling all of these buying and\nselling would itself be -- would be dysfunctional; but\nwhat sellers would know thereafter is that they couldn't\nrely upon the contracts. They would either have to stay\nout of that market or they would have to charge a risk\npremium, which would raise prices to buyers and\nconsumers.\nSo that long run harm of making it less\nreliable to engage in contracting would have to be\novercome by a fairly severe showing of what the\nshort-term harms would be to one particular set of\nbuyers.\nThe Commission has made those findings.\nThey found circumstances where the contracts gave first\npriority to commercial uses of power, and at a time of\nshortage that meant that residential customers would be\ncut off. The Commission ordered that done.\nThe Commission has been on the job here.\nThey have -- the process by which they grant\nmarket-based rate authority is an elaborate one. They\nget assurances that the sellers lack transmission market\npower, generation market power, that there are no\nbarriers to entry, that if they have transmission\nfacilities there is open access. They -- any party can\nchallenge that. And any party in this case, any party\nin this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said the Commission\nis on the job, but one of the pieces of information here\nis that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction\nin the spot market carried over into the forward market,\nsuch that prices in the forward market were inflated.\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct. But what\nthe Commission realized is that the parties were aware\nof what was going on in the spot market. They were able\nto contract on that basis. They could have asked for\nwhat's called a Memphis clause, giving either party the\nright to seek modification based on some administrative\ndetermination of what a right price would be at some\nlater point. They did not. They kept in the clauses\nthat allowed only joint approaches to the Commission,\nand indeed in one contract said that the rates are fixed\nand shall remain in effect for the terms of this\nagreement. That language is illustrative of how you\ncould not enter into a long-term contract and assure\nthat the terms were binding. The fact that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what\nthat statement means, anyway. The current dysfunction\ncarries over into -- into the future market? What does\nthat mean?\nMR. DELLINGER: Right. Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it mean that because\nof the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure\nwhat the rates are going to be down the road? Of course\nit means that. But doesn't a dysfunction always mean\nthat?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. Dysfunction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't that why you\nenter into long-term contracts?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because given the current\ndysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to\nbe down the road.\nMR. DELLINGER: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the\nstaff saying something more than that in that -- in that\nreport?\nMR. DELLINGER: I don't -- I don't know what\nyou're intimating, but what the conclusion was of the\nCommission was, for example, that there was no basis to\nsupport a finding that the Respondents exercised market\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Commission didn't\n-- didn't respond to the staff report, right? Didn't\nsay anything one way or another about it.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, the Commission\nexpressly said with respect to the -- to the staff\nreport that there was no evidence of any manipulation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they say it with\nrespect to the staff report? Or -- I thought they\nthought the staff report was irrelevant?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. The aspect of the\nstaff report that said that forward prices were\ninfluenced by prices in the spot market and that there\nhad been dysfunction was irrelevant precisely because it\nwould have been relevant were the Commission making its\nown bureaucratic determination of a right price. But\nthe parties made the determination of the prices that\nthey wanted to agree to, the terms they wanted to agree\nto, and they did so with full knowledge both that they\nknew there had been some manipulation, that there was\nvolatility and that they knew they didn't know, as\nJustice Scalia, said the extent of it; and, therefore,\nthat's precisely why you want to be involved in a\ncontract that guarantees you today that, no matter what\nhappens to prices in the next year or next summer, one\nof these -- one of these utilities has a guarantee of\npower at $105.\nI will reserve my time for Mr. Kneedler,\nunless there are questions.\nNo, I'm not. He is going to do a rebuttal,\nwhatever amount of time we have, Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- unless there are further\nquestions.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Wright.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI'd like to start off by picking up on\nJustice Ginsburg's observation that FERC understood\nitself to be without discretion here, and add the point\nthat this is an extremely unusual case where FERC\nthought it lacked discretion to apply the statute. In\nthe briefs, there is now agreement that the just and\nreasonable standard applies to all rates under the Act\nand couldn't be more clear that the just and reasonable\nstandard applies. FERC --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Among your arguments, and\nthe arguments of the Respondent, seems to be in some\ntension -- seems to me in some tension to FERC's\nmarket-based rate program. Do you -- do you acknowledge\nthat that is permissible interpretation of the Federal\nPower Act or not?\nMR. WRIGHT: I -- there is much that we\ndon't disagree with about the market-based rate program.\nI suppose we do think that there are two things that\nFERC has to make sure that it does as part of that\nprogram.\nFirst, in -- in approving the market-based\nrate program, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said when there is\na competitive market, FERC may rely upon market-based\nrates in lieu of cost-of-service regulations. That\nmakes perfect sense to us, but when there is a\ncompetitive market. So we think a critical part of a\nmarket-based rate program is that there must be an\ninquiry into whether or not the market was competitive\nwhen the contract was entered into. Of course, we have\nthe unusual circumstance here where Professor Kahn and\nnine other deregulatory economists wrote a letter in May\n2001 saying markets are out of control, this is the\nunusual circumstance where FERC should enter a price\ncap.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it -- isn't it a\ncentral requirement of a market-based rate program that\nFERC cannot, except perhaps in very limited\ncircumstances, go back and undo contracts that had been\nentered into under that program, based on a\nretrospective determination that the rates are not just\nand reasonable, in the same sense that FERC would have\napplied that term if the utility had simply filed a\ntariff?\nMR. WRIGHT: Justice Alito, all rates must\nbe just and reasonable. We are not arguing that FERC\nneeds to go back to a cost-of-service ratemaking\napproach; but an agency that sees just and reasonable\nand thinks it's applying a just and reasonable standard,\nfor 70 years has thought it's either going to do a\ncost-of-service approach, or more recently it's going to\nrely on the market to make rates just and reasonable,\nour modest point is that it can't ignore the market. It\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I guess this is\nwhat's bothering us. Your point does not seem, at least\nto me, to be a modest point, because if I understand\nwhere you're going, you're saying that in a market with\nthe degree of volatility of this one at the time these\ncontracts were made, no contract is enforceable. It\nwill last only so long as -- as one party does not\ncomplain about a disadvantage, and the minute it does,\nit's back in front of FERC. And the argument is being\nmade that in fact a market-based rate cannot be enforced\nthrough contract because the very premise -- i.e., what\nyou call and what was called a competitive -- Judge\nGinsburg called a competitive market -- was absent.\nIsn't that the consequence of what you're arguing?\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes. Let me make four points\nhere, though, that I think make absolutely clear that it\nwould not set a broad precedent to revisit the contracts\nhere.\nAnd the four points are first, the\nGovernment acknowledges in its brief at page 16, this\nwas the worst electricity market crisis in history.\nSecond --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how do we know when\nwe're only in the second worst?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WRIGHT: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I mean the\nproblem is --\nMR. WRIGHT: No, no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't see any -- and\nI realize that you're giving me limiting principles to\nwhat seems to me in effect a general rule that says no\ncontracts are enforceable, if they are made during\nperiods of market volatility, however sensible they may\nbe given the premise of that volatility.\nAnd your first proposal for a limiting\nprinciple is this is the worst of times, and I don't see\nhow that's going to help because somebody is always\ngoing to claim, well, these times are -- are almost as\nbad.\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, of course the\nFederal Power Act instructs a Federal agency to ensure\nthat rates are just and reasonable. A -- the Federal\nPower Act --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Look --\nMR. WRIGHT: The FERC, FERC needs to grapple\nwith this.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's a good -- I mean\nthat's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it\npossible to make an enforceable contract under these\ncircumstances?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I haven't heard a limiting\nprinciple yet. You have three others.\nMR. WRIGHT: I have three others. There was\nrampant noncompliance with the reporting requirements.\nThe Government concedes that, too: FERC's market-based\nrate program, however well it might work today after\nit's been improved, as the Government said in its\nopposition to cert, however well it's been improved on\naccount of the 2005 amendments --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did these -- did -- did the\nPetitioners here -- do you claim that the Petitioners\nhere were guilty of failure to report?\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes. They -- they were not --\nthey were not complying with the -- we contend that the\nreporting requirements that were in effect in 2001 were\ninconsistent with the statute and not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's a\ndifferent issue. That -- that may be that the\nCommission was derelict in -- in having a nonstatutory\ncondition. But did these -- did these Petitioners -- do\nyou claim, is it a basis for your claim before FERC,\nthat these Petitioners failed to follow the reporting\nrequirements that were in effect?\nMR. WRIGHT: Our -- our basic argument is\nthe rates weren't just and reasonable --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought.\nMR. WRIGHT: And the rates weren't just and\nreasonable on the day the contracts were signed. And\nlet me make clear --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but here I just want\nto make sure I understand. You're saying one -- one\nlimiting principle is the re-examination of contract\nmight be limited or at least only prompted by a -- a\nfailure to follow reporting requirements. I can\nunderstand that and that offhand seems to me perfectly\nfair. It may not cover this case, but I can understand\nthat. What are your other two reasons?\nMR. WRIGHT: My third is, as Commissioner\nMassey stated in his dissent, without contradiction by\nthe majority, that if the just and reasonable standard\nwere -- would be applied, these rates would be declared\nunlawful, because they were multiples of traditional\nprices.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that seems to me\nconsistent with the problem that I have with your\nargument. And that is, if you make a contract in a\nperiod of high volatility, and it seems reasonable to\nthe two parties to come up with a rate that is certainly\na higher rate than anybody would come up with if they\nwere going through cost-plus-return ratemaking, the\ncontract is vulnerable. And it seems to me that\nCommissioner Massey's argument is consistent with the\nconclusion that all those contracts are vulnerable. So\nI don't see that as any limiting principle. What's your\nfourth one?\nMR. WRIGHT: The fourth one is, as Justice\nGinsburg has noted, that FERC said in December 2000,\nbefore all of the contracts at issue were negotiated,\nthat it would monitor and -- and would -- deems rates\nabove $74 suspect. All the contracts in here have rates\nabove that benchmark. So it's the worst crisis in\nhistory; there's rampant noncompliance; rates were\nmultiples of traditional pricings, and FERC had said it\nwas going to study these rates closely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I can understand --\nunder your fourth point, I could understand the position\nif the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it\nis suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand\nit, is a much broader claim. You're saying the entire\ncontract ought to be abrogated in the public interest,\nnot merely above 74 but below 74. Isn't that correct?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nWe want this case to be sent back to FERC.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And when you get there,\nyou're saying abrogate this contract.\nMR. WRIGHT: We are saying reduce the rates,\nand --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying -- have you\nat any point said reduce the rates to $74?\nMR. WRIGHT: I'm sure different -- there are\nmany different parties on my side. I'm sure we have\nmany different theories. Could I tell you what FERC 's\ndone with respect to the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I will -- I will stop the\ncross-examination, but I just wanted to get the four\npoints.\nMR. WRIGHT: I appreciate the\ncross-examination. It's helped me get out what I think\nour four points --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if your theory\nprevails and you go back to the Commission, does the\nMorgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller\nwas, does that get reevaluated, too? You reevaluate all\nthe contracts back down the line?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, I -- does Morgan\nStanley's -- well, Morgan Stanley actually -- a number\nof parties in Morgan Stanley's situation chose to file\nprotective actions, and Morgan Stanley didn't. So I\ndon't know whether it has waived its rights or not. But\nI think FERC ought to grapple with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me say that,\nconsistent with your theory, that everybody -- that this\nwhole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the\noriginal seller?\nMR. WRIGHT: Right.\nWell, Your Honor, the way these markets\nwork, there is every reason to think that Morgan Stanley\ndoesn't have the sort of claim that they have suggested\nwithout telling us they have. And, of course, they know\nwhat their portfolio is.\nThere is every reason to think they bought\npower before the big spike came, and that they bought\npower since then, and that they're not -- they're not\nbuying power at 104 and selling it to Snohomish at 105,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, good for them.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean you're suggesting\nthey should be punished for that? I don't understand\nwhat -- what follows? I mean --\nMR. WRIGHT: We're not, Your Honor, but I\nwould remind you this is a plain-language case. The\nstatute requires rates to be just and reasonable. That\n-- for 70 years, that's meant something to\nadministrative agencies. The reason --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how would you -- how\nwould you go about determining in this case? You said\nit's not the traditional cost of service, return on\ninvestment. So how -- if you prevail, what should FERC\ndo to determine whether this rate was fair and\nreasonable?\nMR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWe expect that, ultimately, it will do, or\nshould do, what it's done with respect to the spot\nmarket. With respect to the spot market, it has\nprovided relief to parties who bought at the same time.\nAnd what it has done is it has -- it has determined what\nit calls a mitigated market clearing price.\nIt has done this with great elaborate --\nelaboration for periods as low as 10 minutes for the\nperiod in 2000 - 2001, when it is now conceded\nmanipulation raised rates on the spot market. And it\nhas taken the prices that were paid, and it has -- it\nhas reduced them to what it calls the \"mitigated market\nclearing price.\"\nThis is -- this is described in painful\ndetail in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 2006 CPUC versus\nFERC opinion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't your clients know\nthat the market was chaotic at the time they entered\ninto this long-term contract? I mean does this come as\na surprise that after the fact, now that you're paying\nmore than the market price is, you want to kick over a\nlong-term contract you entered into?\nWhat has changed? Did you not know that the\nmarket was chaotic? Wasn't that the very reason you\nentered into the long-term contract.\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we had a sort of a\nHenry Ford choice. Any -- we had a choice of a variety\nof rates as long as they were unjust and unreasonable.\nWe didn't have any alternative, because of the market\nmanipulation, that allowed us to get a just and\nreasonable rate on the spot market, on long-term markets\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You were saying that the\nmost -- the most reasonable thing for us to do was to\nenter into a long-term contract in order to mitigate the\neffects of the chaotic spot market. You understood\nthat.\nMR. WRIGHT: In large part, because FERC had\ntold us they were going to monitor these contracts and\nuse the $74 benchmark.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, you did very well\nunder these contracts. Initially, you were even\nreselling some of the energy that you got. You got it\nat a price so much below what was then the market that\nyou made a profit by reselling it.\nBut now that things have changed, you don't\nlike the long-term contract.\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, it's our position\nthat we have to prove these were just and reasonable on\nthe day they were entered. And the way these markets\nwork, local utilities like Snohomish buy energy, and\nthey always sell a little bit. They're going to lose\n153 million over the life of this contract. And it's\nalways been the life of the contract that FERC has\nthought was the -- the real benchmark.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Wright, may I go back\nto your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? She\nasked you: What do you want FERC to do if it does what\nyou want them to do?\nAnd you said: We want them to make the same\nkind of adjustments ex post that they made to the spot\nprices.\nIsn't there one big difference here to --\nbetween readjusting spot prices and rewriting or\nabrogating a contract like this?\nIn the case of adjusting the spot prices, in\neffect. What they are saying is: Somebody isn't going\nto make the killing that he thought he was making. It\nwas -- a spot price indicates it was a snap decision.\nPeople were reacting to -- to changes in the market from\nhour to hour. And the Commission is going to go back\nand say, you know, you're out of luck on the killing you\nthought you made.\nWhen, on the other hand, the Commission, in\neffect, rewrites or abrogates a contract, it is saying\nsomething very different. It is saying: You may not\nengage in long-term reliance on the agreements that you\nmake. And isn't that a huge difference?\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we think that FERC\ncould, and it seems clear that it will, distinguish\nbetween the spot market and long-term contracts on these\nbases. Our point there is that we probably, if it does,\nthen have to overcome a hurdle and show that there\nwasn't effective competition at the time the long-term\ncontracts were entered into.\nFERC might rationally, once it grapples with\nthis, decide that that's the way the just and reasonable\nstandard applies.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but with respect,\ndoesn't that, in effect, mean -- going back to your\nanswer to Justice Ginsburg -- that what you really want\nis to say there wasn't effective competition.\nThere wasn't effective competition because\nthe market was chaotic.\nAnd, therefore, in a chaotic market,\nincluding this one, a long-term contract which later\nturns out to be disadvantageous to one side is\nunenforceable.\nIsn't that what you -- your real answer to\nJustice Ginsburg is.\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, again, I\ndon't think we should prevail, and it's not our position\nthat we prevail, unless we show that we didn't have just\nand reasonable alternatives at the time we entered into\nthe contract. We don't think we can --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean -- that's\nwhere I don't think that, at least with me, helps your\nargument. We all know that there is a broad umbrella\nstandard of justness and reasonableness. One index of\njustness is the set of conditions under which the\nparties operate. The conditions in this case were\nconditions of chaos.\nAnd what the other side is saying, I think,\nis: We each tried to make the most reasonable deal we\ncould, the most advantageous for us that we could, under\nthese conditions of chaos.\nThey certainly produced a rate that wouldn't\nhave been produced in a calm time either by market-based\ntariffs or by cost-plus-return ratemaking. But under\nthe circumstances that we did operate in, this is what\nit produced. And we were dealing at arm's length.\nNobody was engaging in fraud, et cetera. So that's\njust.\nAnd I think when you say, as you did a\nminute ago, there is an overarching obligation or\nstandard of justness and reasonableness, I think you're\nsaying that that reasoning that I just tried to outline\nis not sufficient reasoning for sustaining the contract.\nNow, if I'm wrong, tell me.\nIf I'm right, it seems to me you're really\nsaying ditch the contracts if they were entered into in\na period of high volatility.\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, let me make\nclear what -- what we mean by \"chaos\" or \"high\nvolatility.\" We think we have to show that manipulation\nwas affecting the market. We don't -- we don't think we\nare entitled to relief if it was the weather that was\naffecting the market. FERC's 2003 staff --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you entitled to relief\nif there was manipulation, but these people were not\nengaging in the manipulation? In other words, they are,\nin effect, innocent of the manipulation; but they, as\nsellers, are in a chaotic market. Are you entitled to\nrelief against them under those circumstances?\nMR. WRIGHT: We -- we don't think that a\nstatute that protects consumers and says that consumers\nget just and reasonable rates was enacted to prevent --\nto overcome contracts only when there is fraud in the\ncontract.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble is that\njustness is a relational category, and you are -- I\nthink you are saying we don't have to consider justness\nto the parties who were doing -- we will assume for the\nsake of the question -- the best that they could under\nbad circumstances. You are saying justness only goes to\nthe ultimate retail ratepayer.\nMR. WRIGHT: Again, Your Honor, we don't\nneed the statute. The statute is superfluous insofar as\nit affects contracts, and that is its main effect, if it\nrequires fraud in the negotiation of the contract.\nAnd, again, if Morgan Stanley can show that\nit was a victim of manipulation, too, then it is\nentitled to relief. There has certainly been some of\nthat with respect to some of these spot market deals\nwhere there are occasionally intervening parties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Wright, I really don't\nunderstand why you would -- why you say, you know, if --\nif the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know,\nan Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly\nokay. But if it's due to manipulation, it's bad. I can\nunderstand if you added manipulation by one of the\nparties, by the sellers, that I could understand.\nBut so long as it's a factor extrinsic to\nthe parties to the contract, what difference does it\nmake to the buyer whether the flukishness of the market\nis caused by the weather or by manipulation by somebody\nother than the seller?\nIn other words, I think it's not enough to\nshow manipulation. That's what's going on in the\nmarket. And you're trying to save yourself from it. So\nlong as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see\nhow you have a -- I don't know -- an equitable case.\nMR. WRIGHT: It -- on the equities, if the\nlocal utilities end up bearing the brunt of making bad\njudgments about the weather, that's one thing. It's\nquite another thing if there is rampant non-compliance,\nhiding the fact that there's been massive withholding of\nenergy, and driving -- and these spikes were not\naccidental, by any means. That seems to us to be, you\nknow, a -- a sort of distinction that the -- that the\nlaw draws all the time.\nAnd let me say the example came --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled by your\nanswer to Justice Scalia. If, say, it is something like\nan atom bomb or terrorism or something totally innocent,\nwhere the parties are -- but it causes the same economic\nconsequence, namely: That the rates are a lot higher\nthan they otherwise would be, why do you draw the\ndistinction that he says doesn't make sense?\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, I guess the ultimate\ndistinction is that there isn't somebody making a whole\nlot of money on account of market manipulation\nsomewhere.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in each case the\nrates would be higher than they otherwise would, and\nyou'd have to say they're high enough to be no longer\njust and reasonable.\nMR. WRIGHT: Well, \"just and reasonable,\"\nagain, has always -- has traditionally first meant a\nsort of cost-of-service inquiry and more recently means\na market inquiry. But, again, a market inquiry doesn't\n-- means a competitive market, an effective market, as\nProfessor Kahn said, not a market totally infected by\nmanipulation. And then, in any case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if infected by an act\nof God, it seems to me the same consequence.\nMR. WRIGHT: I guess consumers bear the\nbrunt of acts of God, but don't -- shouldn't bear the\nbrunt of market manipulation that was unlawful and now\nis --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you could argue\nthat it should be just the obverse.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you really arguing\n-- no, but aren't you really making the argument that\nthe notion of justness does have an equitable component\nthat looks to the source of the trouble; and if the\nsource of the chaos in the market are the very people\nwho are trying to make a profit on your contract, that\nis a reason to say that that market-based rate is not a\njust one, because they created the conditions that gave\nthem the leverage to get you to make the deal that you\nmade?\nBut if they are not guilty of improper\nconduct in making it, then, you know, everybody has to\ntake his lumps. Aren't you saying something like that?\nMR. WRIGHT: We don't know because FERC\nhasn't looked at it, what -- who Morgan Stanley paid and\nwhat they paid and who made the money here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but just as a general\npremise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you\nassuming something like that?\nMR. WRIGHT: We certainly think that the\nbest result would be that whoever was manipulating the\nmarket ought to be the one who ends up getting their\nreturn cut; and that the local utilities and any\ninnocent middlemen should be made whole, too. That's\nfine.\nIt was brought up earlier in discussing the\nmarket-based rate program sort of what sorts of remedies\nwere allowed. And let me say that -- well, I think this\ncame out, but the Enron example shows very well. Enron\ngot market-based rate authority in 1993. Enron was not\nthe only player, but was a leading player in the market\nmanipulation in 2000-2001. FERC didn't get around to\nlifting their market-based rate authority until 2003,\nand they did it strictly prospectively.\nIt is a core point of our argument today\nthat that shouldn't be allowed. And I think the answer\nwas: Well, market-based rate authority only results in\nlifting the market-based rate authority; a 206 action\nunder the Federal Power Act is where consumers get\nrelief.\nThat's right, and we're here to get relief,\nand we think that ultimately the parties that\nmanipulated the market and made too much money on\naccount of the manipulation ought to -- ought to lose\nwhat they paid; and, certainly, the ratepayers shouldn't\nbear the costs; and if there are innocent middlemen they\nshouldn't bear the cost, either.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And, to the extent that you\nmake that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the\nquestion that I put to you a couple of times: Why, why\nisn't your argument anything less broad than the fact\nthat you can't make a contract in a chaotic market?\nAnd you are, at least as a subset of what\nyou are saying, telling us that if the contract -- if\nthe chaos in the market was caused by the impropriety of\none contracting party, that party should not profit from\nit. And I understand that answer. That if -- to the\nextent that that is your position, it is an answer to my\nquestion.\nMR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nAnd let me remind the Court that one case\nthat the other side I don't think has acknowledged\nsufficiently is this Court's 1974 Texaco decision. That\nwas a situation where FERC -- well, the Federal Power\nCommission attempted -- attempted to do what the other\nside is asking this Court to rule today, to essentially\nmake contracts sacrosanct and not subject to any\nchallenge.\nFERC had told small producers that it\nwouldn't -- that they could enter into contracts and\nthey didn't have to file the contracts, and the\nCommission wouldn't review the contracts to see if they\nwere just and reasonable. This Court very clearly held,\nquote, \"The Commission lacks authority to place\nexclusive reliance on market prices,\" unquote.\nUnder this statute, which requires just and\nreasonable rates, there must be coexistence between\ncontracts and a regulatory backstop. And, again, in the\nsituation here that you helped me review -- the worst\nelectricity market crisis in history, rampant\nnon-compliance, rates that were multiples of traditional\nlevels, and couldn't be justified under anything FERC\nhas ever called a just and reasonable standard, and FERC\nhad said it was going to examine a benchmark -- this is\na case that FERC has to go back and explain why, at\nleast explain why it thinks these rates are just and\nreasonable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just and reasonable when?\nMR. WRIGHT: On the day they were made.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On the day they were\nagreed to.\nMR. WRIGHT: And we think they weren't,\nbecause they were the product of market manipulation\nthat made all of the rates available --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were just and\nreasonable --\nMR. WRIGHT: -- that made all rates unjust\nand unreasonable on that date, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I think -- and here I\nwant to be clear on this -- you're saying they were not\njust and reasonable on the date they were made, number\none, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos\nwas manipulation by these Petitioners. That at least is\npart of your argument.\nBut I think you're also saying that the\nrates were not just and reasonable if they were the\nresult of market manipulation by others, not these\nPetitioners. Am I correct that your argument is broad\nenough to encompass the second alternative?\nMR. WRIGHT: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And even that argument is\nmuch narrower than what the Ninth Circuit held, isn't\nit? The Ninth Circuit just referred to \"dysfunction in\nthe market.\" They didn't say: And dysfunction means\nmanipulation by anybody. They seemed to have included\nall sorts of other things: The California regulatory\nprogram, the weather, and a number of other factors.\nMR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we certainly agree\nthat the test can't be dysfunction; that FERC has to\ngrapple with this issue and give it a concrete meaning.\nI'm sure there would be disagreement on\nremand as to exactly what it means, and there are lines\nto be drawn. But FERC needs to do that. FERC hasn't\ndone that.\nFERC honestly thought -- again, this is an\nunusual case. FERC honestly thinks that the public\ninterest standard, or thought that the public interest\nstandard, is a completely different animal than the just\nand reasonable standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you are relying on the\nnarrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely,\nmanipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you\nto demonstrate that there was manipulation by the\nseller? Has that been -- has that been established?\nMR. WRIGHT: We are relying on both, Your\nHonor. We are -- our -- our main argument is that all\nrates in the West at this period of time --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because of manipulation by\nsomebody.\nMR. WRIGHT: -- were the result of\nmanipulation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, didn't the ALJ find\nthere wasn't manipulation in this market, the forward\nmarket?\nMR. WRIGHT: And the ALJ found that the spot\nmarket -- the ALJ found that the spot market\nmanipulation didn't affect the forward markets. No one\nagrees to that today. FERC has disowned it. Morgan\nStanley has disowned it. I'm told that the ALJ has\ndisowned it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: FERC disowned -- did FERC\nreject the finding of the ALJ as to manipulation of this\n--\nMR. WRIGHT: FERC said it was irrelevant.\nThat was the part of FERC's first order, where it said\nit is irrelevant whether the manipulation of the spot\nmarkets affected manipulation in the long-term markets.\nThat would be relevant only if the just and reasonable\nstandard applies. Of course, the just and reasonable\nstandard applies.\nOne final point. One remarkable aspect of\nthis case is after FERC said that in its initial order,\nMorgan Stanley asked them to reconsider it, and they\nsaid we won't do that. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, in your\nrebuttal, will you address the state of the record with\nrespect to evidence or findings about possible\nmanipulation by these Petitioners?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. On page 1589 of the\njoint appendix the Commission said we've reviewed the\nstaff reports findings in the 100-day discovery, which\nwere discovery occurring in other proceedings, and found\nno evidence to support a finding of market manipulation\nthat specifically affected the contracts at issue.\nIt's important to recognize that there were\ntwo separate markets here. There was the spot market,\nwhich had struck in addition to all the weather and all\nthose things, it had structural problems requiring the\nCalifornia investor-owned utilities to trade on the spot\nmarket, which contributed to the opportunities for the\nmanipulation. The dysfunction and manipulation were\ntied together in that market, but there was -- the ALJ\nfound that the long-term market was not dysfunctional.\nIt was functioning, it operated as it should. Both\nparties --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- know that's a premise\nin the debate. I find it hard to accept. How could the\ntwo be totally separate? It was the crisis that made it\nnecessary to engage in the long-term account.\nMR. KNEEDLER: FERC has great discretion in\ndeciding how to apply the public interest standard.\nIt's not necessary to find that they were absolutely\nseparate. It's sufficient, though, to say that the\nproblems in the two separate markets -- the situations\nin the two separate markets were very different. And in\nthe long-term market, FERC concluded it was important to\nmaintain the integrity of the contracts, indeed, under a\nmarket-based system, as Justice Alito said, more\nimportant now even than at the time of Mobile, because\nyou can't have a functioning market based-rate system\nwithout confidence that contracts would be upheld.\nIn that situation, as this Court suggested\nin Verizon, you had sophisticated buyers and\nsophisticated sellers dealing in a situation in which\nboth knew that there was chaos in the spot market, that\nthere was -- there were structural problems there, and\nthat there were allegations of manipulation. But those\nallegations did not carry over to the, to the long-term\nmarket.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May I ask, I am sure you\nunderstand that a finding that there was no\nmanipulations that affected these contracts is not the\nsame as a finding that there was no manipulation by\nthese sellers in the market.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no such\nfinding that there was no manipulation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. But what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no finding\nthat there was by these sellers.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. And what the\nCommission was basically saying is we are treating the\nlong-term market situation differently. Some of these\nsellers may have been engaged in manipulation in the\nshort-term market, but FERC was trying to draw a\ndistinction between the spot market and moving forward\nand maintaining the integrity of markets in the\nlong-term where both the buyers and the sellers were\nboth buyers and sellers typically.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, in fact, it didn't get\nthat articulate. The closest it came to answering my\nquestion, I take it, is at the point to which you\nreferred me in the joint appendix, no effect on these\ncontracts?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. We don't\nthink FERC should have to engage in a market-based\nevaluation of possible manipulation in order to hold two\nparties, two sophisticated parties to their bargain.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then what do you say\nabout the standard of justness? In effect, I think\nyou're saying it doesn't matter whether these particular\nPetitioners manipulated the market creating the\nconditions under which these contracts were made at a\nprice which turned out to be much higher than the spot\nprice would be later, it's irrelevant. That's your\nposition, isn't it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The manipulation in the spot\nmarket, we think FERC properly concluded, did not have\nto be taken into account --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not talking about what\nFERC said. I'm talking about your position. I think\nyour position is that even if these people -- even if\nthese people -- Petitioners manipulated and that created\nthe -- or contributing to creating the market under\nwhich these contracts were made, that is irrelevant in\nlooking at the contracts --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's something that\nFERC would have to decide in this case. But I don't\nbelieve a claim of that sort has been made here. I\nbelieve the claim has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking what claim\nhas been made. I want to know -- I want to know what\nthe government's position is.
