        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 02-575, Nike, Inc. versus Marc Kasky.\nMr. Tribe.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn the mid-1990s there was, of course, an\nintense debate on the pros and cons of globalization, and\nof the impact of companies like Nike on workers in the\nThird World, where Nike contracted out much of its\nproduction to some 900 factories in 51 countries with over\n600,000 employees.\nNow, the critics, many from pro-labor groups,\ndenounced Nike as the chief exemplar of the evils of\nglobalization, arguing that Nike was simply shifting\nproduction to places where it could exploit the workforce\nand act in ways that were illegal and immoral, and the\ncritics took much of their documentation from the media.\nOf course, Nike disagreed, using the same media\nvenues as the critics had used to document what it thought\nwere the connections between its presence and activities\nin countries like South Korea and Vietnam and the\ndevelopment of technological expertise in those countries,\nas well as the expansion of job opportunities there, and\nalso arguing that it had put in place significant\nsafeguards against abuse.\nProducts were mentioned only in response to\npeople who said, well, look, this product is made in\nsuch-and-such country and it's exploitative, and Nike\nwould have a press release, or it -- sometimes it would be\nan op ed saying no, you've got the wrong country, this\nproduct is made in such-and-such other place. These were\nletters to the editor, pamphlets. It was on the Internet,\ncorrespondence.\nAs you might expect, the critics talked back.\nThere was a lively political dialogue about the realities\nof the Third World and Nike's role in it, a little hard to\nseparate the two, when, as the dissenter below, one of the\ndissenters below said Nike had become the poster child for\nthe evils, supposedly, of globalization, so not\nsurprisingly the debate was inconclusive.\nThe surprise came when the story took an unusual\nturn, unusual at least in our system of Government. One\nof the Nike critics, Marc Kasky, asked the California\ncourts to endorse his view and to hold that the statements\nthat Nike was putting out were false or were misleading.\nHe invoked California's unfair competition law and the\nfalse advertising law that it included, which gives anyone\nstanding, so Mr. Kasky certainly qualified, to sue another\nperson or corporation, here Nike and its officers, for\nmaking any statement in a newspaper or other publication\nsuch, it goes on to say, or any advertising device,\nincluding over the Internet, concerning any circumstance\nor matter of fact connected with anything the speaker\nintends to sell if the statement is untrue or misleading,\nand the California Supreme Court has read that to cover\nanything that might mislead the public.\nThe plaintiff, empowered to sue by the Business\nand Professions Code 17204 on behalf of, quote, the\ngeneral public, unquote, did not, under California\ndecisional law, have to allege or prove falsity -- it\ncould be an omission that made something misleading -- he\ndidn't have to allege or prove reliance by or injury to\nanyone, or any particular level of fault. An inadvertent\nomission will suffice under the Day decision.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly some omissions, even\nthough not technically false, could be false in their --\nin what they convey.\nMR. TRIBE: Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, and,\nin fact, one of the suggestions made by the California\nSupreme Court for how a company could engage in this\ndebate without any problem is simply omit all the facts\nthat might connect it to the situation, and that kind of\nomission, it would be certainly alleged, would be\nmisleading, so the only solution that Nike is given is,\ntalk in vague generalities.\nI don't deny, Mr. Chief Justice, that there can\nbe cases and there can even be fraud cases, though it's\nhard, given the pleading requirements of the fraud tort,\nthat do rest on omissions, but I'm just suggesting how --\nhow capacious -- how capacious this is.\nThe relief that is available and was requested\nby Mr. Kasky includes, and I don't think we should forget\nthe importance of this, an adjudication that the defendant\nis guilty of an unlawful business practice, and in Nike's\ncase that would be no small matter. I mean, it would be\nsaid you're guilty of exploiting women and children in the\nThird World, guilty as charged, and not being honest about\nit, a scarlet letter more damning than the label of\nNational Labor Relations Act violator that this Court a\nyear ago in B&K versus NLRB treated as so grave a blot on\nthe reputation of a company that it mustn't be imposed for\nactivity within the First Amendment zone without giving\nthe defendant significant leeway.\nSecondly, there is available a court-ordered\ninjunction both prohibitory and mandatory in one case\ninvolving the Alta-Dena Dairy in California under this\nstatute. The Consumers Union of the United States brought\nthe suit as a Private Attorney General against a dairy\nthat had been putting out its products of raw milk saying\nthey were just as nutritious and healthy as pasteurized\nmilk, and the remedy was a 10-year mandate of corrective\nspeech, as it were, corrective education.\nQUESTION: To -- to make them realize that raw\nmilk was not as good as pasteurized milk?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I guess to make some people --\nthis -- that's what the statute says, that some people\nmight have been misled. Needless to say, the kind of show\ntrial that would be involved in this case is a lot more\nexpensive than that one.\nThat case, by the way, took 54 days to try,\n44 witnesses, there were 40,000 pages of exhibits, at the\nend a restitutionary order of $100,000 was given, and in\nthat case the Attorney General joined the suit, he\ncollected the restitution --\nQUESTION: Do -- do we have a case in which we\nsay that a -- a civil scheme -- I -- I suppose there are\nsome criminal remedies here, but let's just think about\nthis as a civil scheme, that a civil scheme of this type\nis so burdensome, so extensive that it chills speech and\nis therefore invalid? I -- I --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I suppose Bantam Books --\nQUESTION: We -- we have plenty of cases that\nthe criminal laws are either vague or overly broad and\nthat they chill speech. What about in the civil context?\nMR. TRIBE: I think Bantam Books comes to mind.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: And there it was less than this, it\nwas simply you were on a list of books. It seems to me\nthat the Court in the National Labor Relations Act context\nitself took the position in B&K that chilling effect was\nimportant, and what about defamation?\nI mean, the central meaning of New York Times v.\nSullivan and Gertz and, you know, and Time v. Hill is that\neven when you have someone who is harmed, reputational\nharm, concrete harm, so that the regulation of speech is\nsimply ancillary to vindicating tangible interest, even\nthere the chilling effect is so great that even though\nthere's no positive value in false statements you have to\nput a burden -- it's a matter of public interest.\nQUESTION: You would have to say that this\ncomplaint and the adjudicatory system it wished to invoke\nchills speech, therefore the complaint must be dismissed.\nI mean, is that the remedy you're --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, essentially that's right,\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Tribe, this --\nMR. TRIBE: -- this trial itself is\nillegitimate.\nQUESTION: -- this -- but this Court has said\nthat even though commercial speech concerns a public\nissue, it's still commercial speech --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and we've applied a different test\nto commercial speech.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: We said that in Central Hudson, we\nsaid that in Bolger.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: How do you distinguish those?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, let me say two things, Justice\nO'Connor.\nConstitution and its First Amendment are wholly invisible\nto commercial speech, that is, if you're going after\ncommercial harms, then there's a lower standard for\ncommercial speech, the four-part Central Hudson test.\nDiscovery Network made clear that if you're coming at it\nfrom a different angle, commercial speech is just as good\nas anything else.\nR.A.V., I think, dispelled the notion that the\nConstitution has these blind spots and, indeed, the whole\napproach of the Court below and of Mr. Kasky was, we don't\neven have to deal with your First Amendment arguments --\nQUESTION: Well, do you -- you take the view\nthat --\nMR. TRIBE: -- because it's misleading\ncommercial speech.\nQUESTION: -- none of the things alleged in the\ncomplaint meet the commercial speech test set out in\nCentral Hudson?\nMR. TRIBE: Actually, we --\nQUESTION: Not one of them?\nMR. TRIBE: That's right, Justice O'Connor, we\ndon't think any of them do, but even if they did, this\nscheme --\nQUESTION: What part do they take?\nMR. TRIBE:\nclose in general, and I think the best way to illustrate\nthat is to look not at the various verbal formulas that\nhave been used by this Court in terms of whether it's\nadvertising format, whether it's -- in one case I think\nJustice Stevens talked about something being\ntransaction-driven, but look at the example that this\ncourt gave in Central Hudson when it was addressing the\nquestion, when we allow greater regulation of speech that\nis closely connected with the Government's power to\nregulate commercial transactions we're not in any way\nlimiting your ability directly to comment.\nThe example that was given was the pamphlet from\nthe Con Ed case. That was an example of direct comment,\nand you look at the pamphlet which was in the joint\nappendix in -- in that case, and it turns out the pamphlet\nis a detailed set of statements about why nuclear power is\nsafer, better, cheaper, better for our independence, and\nyou know what, Con Ed had a nuclear power plant, Indian\nPoint, they clearly had an economic interest in promoting\nthat view, and that's the closest any of these statements\nby Nike come --\nQUESTION: No, no, but there's another -- think\nin your mind of two documents. Document 1 is the letter\nthat Nike sent to the -- the athletic managers.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And then put that side by side with\nthe document in the Bolger case, and --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that's the -- the discussion of\nvenereal disease.\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nQUESTION: Now, what -- now, I -- you have to\nwrite an opinion, let's say --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that says the difference between\nthese is?\nMR. TRIBE: Is that the letter to the university\npresidents and to the athletic departments of these\nuniversities, which is Exhibit R at page 190 of the\nlodging, is an extended argument about why the claims\nagainst Nike are unfounded. It is not in any of its -- it\ndoesn't have Air Jordans on it --\nQUESTION: And then the letter about the --\nMR. TRIBE: -- the way Trojan condoms were --\ncondoms were at the end of that --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: -- submission, and in the Bolger\ncase again, I think if I were writing such an opinion I\nwould say, in Bolger we again reiterated the formula that\nhad been used in Central Hudson and gave as an example of\nsomething that was not commercial speech the promotional\npamphlet. That -- that was sent to some -- you know who\nit was sent to? It was sent only to the customers of\nCon Ed. It was an insert in the bills, so there's no\ndoubt that that was speech that had as its audience only\nthose people who purchased from Con Ed, whereas in this\ncase, these guys are not direct purchasers, and moreover,\nand I think decisively, that's the closest that anything\nin this case comes to commercial speech.\nQUESTION: And as long as we're writing\ndistinctions --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes. I think --\nQUESTION: -- how do I write this distinction?\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nQUESTION: The FTC -- sorry, if you're not\nfinished.\nMR. TRIBE: I'm sorry. I was only going to add\nthat Mr. Kasky, even though he has standing to do a great\ndeal --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: -- does not have standing to sue on\nbehalf of the athletic directors, it turns out, because\nthe California courts in the Rosenbluth case in 2002 said\nthat this is a law where you're supposed to represent the\npublic, not sophisticated organizations, because they\nmight have their own interests, so to the closest this\ncase comes --\nQUESTION: Is it supposed to be like the\nAttorney General, Mr. Tribe --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Tribe, as I understand it --\nMR. TRIBE: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: This sets up a Private Attorney\nGeneral so this -- Mr. Kasky is representing the public,\nbut you've been talking about the great breadth of this\nstatute, and I understand all that, but where -- at just\nthe threshold, the cases were thrown out in the lower\ncourts because they said there's no circumstances, there's\nnothing you can narrow this complaint down to, not one\npiece of literature.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, it's --\nQUESTION: Nothing, not one, and the -- the\nproblem with this case is that it comes to us at such a\npreliminary stage. There's been nothing like a trial,\nthere's been no narrowing of anything, so am I right in\nthinking that to prevail you would have to show that none\nof these, that there's not one that would survive past a\nmotion to dismiss?\nMR. TRIBE: No, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's\nnot right, because what the court of appeals said in this\ncase -- and its opinion I think merits reading. It's at\nleast as good as the dissents in the California Supreme\nCourt.\nWhat it said was, not that we can't pick and\nchoose somewhere in this pile of scattered material, as it\ndescribed it, something that under a different scheme\nmight be permissible. What we hold is impermissible is\nmaking the courts pawns in a public debate and having what\namounts to -- they didn't use the phrase, show trial, but\nessentially they were saying a trial in which you, in\neffect, put on trial such a large and massive question and\nhopeless mix of fact and opinion as the impact on the\nThird World of this large company.\nNow --\nQUESTION: What's -- what is your best reason\nfor saying this is a show trial? In other words, you want\na new category, and I had thought your best reason was,\nand -- and I want to know whether you agree with me or\nwhether there's something better --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: I thought your best reason was that\nthere is no, no need for any allegation and in fact no\nallegation that anyone among the plaintiffs or among\nthe -- the class on behalf of which they sue, the public,\nwas injured in any demonstrable way. Is that the point?\nMR. TRIBE: That --\nQUESTION: Is that what the show trial thing --\nMR. TRIBE: That's probably the single strongest\npoint, and let me connect it with a broader theme, because\nin Discovery Network, when this Court talked about the\nfact that commercial speech is a category that's relevant\nwhen you're going after commercial harm, in a sense to\nprotect consumers from fraud of one kind or another, in\nthe reputation area it is again not speech alone you're\ngoing after. You're trying to vindicate certain interests\nin not being harmed. You have to have someone whose\nreputation is harmed.\nQUESTION: Suppose a California regulatory\nagency signed its name as the plaintiff to this -- to this\ncomplaint.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think simply adding a name\nwouldn't necessarily solve the problem. The Attorney\nGeneral of California put his arm around the Consumer's\nUnion in the Alta-Dena case, but in this case you need\na --\nQUESTION: No, no, but -- but we have -- we have\nsome cases, like the Egg Commission case and so forth --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nQUESTION: -- where the FTC or the FDA --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nQUESTION:\nIt doesn't have to show injury to itself.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right, but it does have to\nshow, the statutes are written to require it to show that\nthere is an area of legitimate regulatory concern.\nConsumers might be fooled into believing, by the Egg\nNutrition Council, that cholesterol is good for your\nheart, and they're trying to protect them.\nQUESTION: Well, you know what we're -- you know\nwhat we're going to hear next, that the Californians are\nvery interested in this.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, first of all, if they're very\ninterested they can do a number of things. They can pass\nsomething like -- Congress passed the Dolphin Protection\nAct saying, if you really care about dolphins, then\nwhenever a can of tuna is sold, it can't use the phrase,\ndolphin-friendly, unless certain things are met.\nCalifornia did this with ozone at one point and then it\nrepealed the ozone-friendly law.\nBut giving a company an idea of what it has to\ndisclose and what the issues are going to be is very\ndifferent from saying, well, here we are, we're sitting\nhere and waiting until somebody --\nQUESTION: And again -- and again, your best\ncase for this is Bantam Books, or --\nMR. TRIBE:\ndefamation line of cases is even better, because at a\nminimum they show that you have to have someone who's\nharmed, and you have to have deliberate or reckless\nfalsehood. Imagine a law --\nQUESTION: Why isn't -- why isn't it -- going\nback to Justice Kennedy's question, why shouldn't it be\nsufficient to say that when it is the State rather than\nany citizen, self-selected, who brings this suit, we would\nat least depend upon some State --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- political responsibility --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and accountability as -- as our --\nour safeguard, and we would let that go forward because we\ndon't think there's enough risk of improper chilling?\nThe distinction is, when anybody can walk in --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nQUESTION: -- there's no accountability. Why\nisn't that the line to draw?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it seems to me, Justice\nSouter, that's a line enough to reverse this decision, but\nlet me just imagine --\nQUESTION: Why, when it wasn't raised below?\nOne of the problems is, if you were going to take out this\nPrivate Attorney General, you would be saying this statute\nis unconstitutional, pro tonto. That wasn't argued below.\nIt didn't surface 'til this Court.\nMR. TRIBE: It was. It was, Justice Ginsburg.\nOn pages 12 to 14 of our reply brief we detailed the\nsequence, and if you look back at the briefs in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court the arguments, all of the First\nAmendment arguments were made, but they didn't get to\nfirst base in that court because it said, hey, misleading\ncommercial speech gets no protection.\nQUESTION: Where was the notice --\nMR. TRIBE: I was going to give an example --\nQUESTION: Where was the notice to the\nCalifornia Attorney General that the statute was being,\nthe constitutionality of that statute was being attacked\nwith regard to the Private Attorney General here?\nMR. TRIBE: It was only as applied, Justice\nGinsburg. That is, it does not suggest -- these laws have\nbeen on the books since the '30s, and we're not suggesting\nthat they have to be scrapped. It's the innovative --\nQUESTION: I thought that -- that Justice\nSouter's question to you was --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- isn't what infects these laws,\nthat -- that you are allowing a champion --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- who has no public accountability,\nand it doesn't -- I don't see how that comes to be an\nas-applied challenge.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's an\nas-applied challenge, because these laws, if applied only\nin cases where harm is alleged and where a court says, to\nsolve the problem we're going to require that it be\nproved, that is, it would be the California courts that\nwould have to redesign the system to fix it, wouldn't be\nunconstitutional.\nI wanted to get --\nQUESTION: I thought that the question that was\nput to you is, isn't this statute infirm in every instance\nwhere you have a Private Attorney General?\nMR. TRIBE: Who alleges no harm, and --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what the statute says.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I think it has to be -- I -- I\nthink it probably is, but I think that the reason that\nit's not cured, although I agree very much with the\nposition the Solicitor General takes that that's the\ndeepest disease, even if it's taken out, imagine a law\nthat said, if you utter a defamatory statement that is\nknowingly false, we're going to impose a gag order. Even\nif the Attorney General administered it, you'd need to\nhave a possible victim.\nI mean, if someone says bad things about William\nShakespeare, and the State of California decides that it\nis going to have a general, floating power to correct\nspeech not connected with the regulatory responsibilities\nof any agency like the FTC or the -- or the SEC, but a\nfree-floating power to correct speech, we think that would\nbe constitutionally infirm, but in this case, in any\nevent, it doesn't come close to commercial speech.\nQUESTION: Is your position that, as I\nunderstand it, that even if this action were brought by\na -- a public agency it would still be impermissible?\nMR. TRIBE: In -- in this forum, where the\npublic agency didn't need to allege, was not administering\na regulatory program to protect people, I -- I think --\nQUESTION: Would you say the same thing if, that\nit would be also impermissible for a public agency to\ninvestigate to determine whether or not the statements\nwere true or false?\nMR. TRIBE: To have an investigation, no. I\nthink that the freedom of speech includes the freedom to\nhave public as well as private debate. That's what this\nis about.\nQUESTION: So that you -- you would agree a\npublic agency could investigate the charges here to\ndetermine whether they are true or false.\nprivate action, could a private party engage in discovery\nto find out whether they were true or false?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, of course, in this case\ndiscovery is the name of the game, it would become a\nmassive thing.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: I think that if we are right that\nthis action dies aborning, if it's like the statute in\nCox v. Cohn itself, where it was simply an impermissible\nthing, and where no trial would cure the problem, then you\ndon't get to that difficulty, but if it's a legitimate\ntrial, if the law were redesigned, very broad discovery\nmight be permissible.\nI'm a little worried about reserving some time,\nbut I -- I don't want to leave you in mid-air --\nQUESTION: You -- You'd better reserve now, or\nyou won't have any to reserve.\nMR. TRIBE: I will do just that, Mr. Chief\nJustice. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nGeneral Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL OLSON:\nplease the Court:\nCalifornia has transferred its governmental\nauthority to regulate marketplace communications to anyone\nand everyone who possesses the price of the filing fee.\nUnelected, unaccountable private enforcers, uninhibited by\nestablished notions of concrete harm or public duty, have\nthe power to advance their own agendas or personal\nideological battles by launching complex, burdensome, and\nexpensive litigation. The in terrorem effect and\npotential for abuse is difficult to overstate.\nThis case can and should, we submit, be\nevaluated according to the means used to regulate speech\nin California, not the content of that speech. The Court\nand several of the Justices on this Court have explicitly\nand repeatedly acknowledged that it is exceedingly\ndifficult, if not impossible, to draw bright lines that\nsegregate marketplace speech according to its content into\ntwo separate, mutually exclusive hemispheres, commercial\nand not commercial. These issues arise in an infinite\narray of contexts. The speakers are imaginative and\ncreative, and rigid, permanent, constitutional\ncategorization is neither advisable nor necessary.\nIf the commercial-noncommercial dichotomy is\nemployed in this case, and in others, either alternative\nhas undesirable consequences.\nspeech -- and this Court has repeatedly stressed that\nspeech in the marketplace of commerce is valuable. It's\nvaluable to consumers, but either it becomes\nnoncommercial, making it difficult for Government to\nregulate to protect the integrity of the marketplace, or\nit then is characterized as commercial, which can open the\nday -- open the way to regimes such as California's, where\nanyone with a whim or a grievance and a filing fee can\nbecome a Government-licensed censor.\nQUESTION: General Olson, do you think that\nCongress would be able to authorize a scheme of Private\nAttorney General, for instance, to enforce SEC\nregulations?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, Justice O'Connor, with\nrespect to concrete harm in connection with specific\nindividuals. First place, Article III would require that,\nthat there actually be concrete harm, an individual\nparticipating in a transaction. This Court has held with\nrespect to 10(b)(5) -- Rule 10(b)(5), for example, that\nthere must be a buyer or seller of security.\nQUESTION: What will happen is, they'll find in\n5 minutes somebody who bought some Nike shoes who feels\nthe same way, you know, so you'll just have this exact\nsuit with a different plaintiff, possibly, or maybe\nMr. Kasky once bought some, for all I know, and -- and so\nthat isn't really going to help, is it?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, it is, Justice Breyer. It\nwill limit -- first of all it will limit the regulation of\nmarketplace speech to the traditional patterns and the\nregimes that have existed --\nQUESTION: Okay, so in your view, if Mr. Kasky\nhas bought some shoes and is prepared to say, you know, if\nI hadn't believed their ad and hadn't been deceived, I\nnever would have bought them --\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- we can go right ahead with this\nsuit?\nGENERAL OLSON: If -- well, if -- there are\nother problems with the California statute in terms of its\nbreadth and its vagueness and things of that nature, but\nthe principal problem that we're talking about here, which\navoids the problem of saying that everything is either\ncommercial or noncommercial, is that traditionally, for\nhundreds of years, the -- the private individual who has\nsuffered that injury has been able to bring an action.\nQUESTION: And I -- I accept that. I'm -- you\npointed to evils of both the other positions, but the\nproblem that I'm having with the third set of evils, which\nI think Justice O'Connor expressed --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- is, imagine an ad -- it's really\nan ad, and it says, our refrigerators are ozone-friendly.\nThe penguins love them, all right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And now it turns out they have the\nworst chemical in there anybody's ever heard of. It's\ngoing to destroy the ozone layer. They're lying through\ntheir teeth, all right.\nNow, that ad, I take it either the FTC or a\nprivate person could proceed against. I would think so.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: If the answer's yes, then we have the\nproblem, which I was going to ask Mr. Tribe, and I -- I\nneed thinking on this, how do you draw a line? How do you\ndraw a line between, this commercial is not a commercial,\nit's a letter sent to the marketing directors -- I think\nthat's their best one -- and my penguin-friendly ozone\ncommercial? How do we draw that line legally, and you're\ndoing it a third way, but how do we stop the private AG,\nCongress having the right to give the private AG the power\nto go after my penguins?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, in the first place,\nthere -- there is the Article III requirement of actual,\nconcrete harm suffered by an individual. There are\nhundreds of years of common law tradition with respect to\nallowing an individual who is the -- who has received in\nsome way a material misrepresentation of fact, which your\nquestion presupposes, that -- that causes justifiable\nreliance in the marketplace and actual harm as a result of\nthat conduct.\nNow, with respect to whether that individual,\nwho can then recover the damage actually suffered, can go\non and then seek some sort of institutional injunctive or\nequitable relief, the courts over the years, over hundreds\nof years have developed circumstances under which the\nremedy in the injunctive suit, or in the equitable action,\nhas to be tailored to the actual harm suffered by the\nindividual.\nQUESTION: General Olson, you're saying that\nschemes other than the one California adopted would\nprobably make much more sense and be more valuable for\nproducing speech, but what -- what principle is it that\nyou rely on to say that California's scheme is bad, just\nbecause there might be others that would be much more\nfavorable to the market of speech?\nGENERAL OLSON: Our principle, Chief Justice\nRehnquist, is that the governmental power to regulate\nspeech in the marketplace, which is constrained by the\nFirst Amendment, has been transferred to private citizens\nwithout the normal constraints that -- that --\nQUESTION: Well, what is your best authority so\nfar as a case from our Court for that proposition?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, one of the --\nQUESTION: Can you answer the question?\nGENERAL OLSON: The -- well, I think that I have\nto start with the Gertz case, in which the -- the Supreme\nCourt said in the context of a libel suit there is a\ngovernmental interest in protecting individuals from\nactual injury suffered, but the Court went on in Gertz to\nsay, but that's the limit of the --\nQUESTION: But when you can pair one share of\nstock, go into court and say, I -- I want a class action,\nI'm going to pursue this securities suit, it's -- it's --\nit goes back to the question Justice Breyer asked. I buy\none pair of Nike shoes, I come and say, okay, I'm a\ncustomer and I want to sue on behalf of all customers\nsimilarly situated. It seems to me that your solution, if\nit allows room for that, doesn't really get to the\nproblem.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, we believe it does,\nJustice Ginsburg. Those kind of suits, persons who bought\none share who were misled in the marketplace, or one pair\nof shoes who had received misleading information, has been\nactually suffered, eliminates the idea that governmental\npower is being transferred to people in gross, that the\nlicense to be Government, to regulate speech, is just\nturned loose to everyone. These are traditional notions\nof who gets into court and under what circumstances.\nAct --\nQUESTION: General Olson, let -- let me just ask\nyou the procedural question, because I found that your\nargument was very well laid out, but I did not see that\nthat position was taken, and my major concern was that the\nCalifornia official who should speak to this question is\nnot before us, wasn't in this case as far as I know, the\nAttorney General of California.\nGENERAL OLSON: Let me answer it this way. This\nCourt has said in Yee versus Escondido that if the legal\nargument is embraced within the question actually properly\nraised, the litigants can make that argument. It also\ndiscussed that same issue in the Lebron case. This --\nQUESTION: Aren't you notified if there's a --\nif there's a question of the constitutionality of a\nstatute passed by Congress so that you will have the\nopportunity to come in and tell the Court what your view\nis?\nGENERAL OLSON: That is a requirement, and it's\naddressed in the appendix in -- in the reply brief and in\nthe appendix to the reply brief filed on behalf of -- of\nNike, but it's also important to recognize that this\nspecific point is raised in the -- in the cert petition\nitself. On pages 27 and 28 Nike said, made the point,\nother features of the California liability scream --\nscheme aggravate the chilling effect, and then goes on to\nelaborate on that point by saying, it invests every single\nCalifornia resident with the power of a Private Attorney\nGeneral, so --\nQUESTION: But that doesn't show that it was\nraised and decided below.\nGENERAL OLSON: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg, but -- and -- and Mr. Tribe says that it\nwas raised to a certain extent below. I can't answer that\nquestion. I can say it was embraced within the question\npresented, it was raised in the cert petition, it is a --\nit is an antecedent question for deciding the First\nAmendment issue in this case, and it is -- it is an issue\nthat California courts have been dealing with for many\nyears.\nFor many, many years the California courts have\ntalked about and considered whether this any person\nprovision is proper. Let me -- I -- I've --\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nGENERAL OLSON: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoeber, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. HOEBER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HOEBER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may\nit please the Court:\nI'm going to start with the jurisdictional\nissues, and the first point, and Mr. Kasky never bought\nany Nikes. He never bought any. I suppose now he never\nwill. He didn't buy any Nikes, he had no standing under\nArticle III. As the plaintiff in this case there was no\ncase or controversy. If it had been brought in Federal\ncourt it would have been dismissed.\nNow, in these circumstances this Court says --\nit said in ASARCO the court can still take jurisdiction,\nbut in ASARCO, the State court judgment there established\nliability and left only questions of what the type of\nremedy might be.\nHere, the State court decision by the California\nSupreme Court effectively overruled Nike's demurrer and\nremanded the case for litigation and trial. That is not\nclose to ASARCO. Nike would have to admit that the\nstatements were false to get anywhere near the judgment in\nASARCO, so the first point on ASARCO is, it doesn't even\napply.\nThe Court would have to extend ASARCO to even\nconsider the next question, which would be, if the Court\ndid that, whether Nike, which, of course has the burden of\nproof, has established that because of this decision it\nwill suffer or has suffered an Article III injury.\nQUESTION: ASARCO, where it's claimed is, it's\nunder the fourth exception listed in ASARCO.\nMR. HOEBER: No, that's -- excuse me, Justice\nBreyer. That's -- that's Cox.\nQUESTION: Oh, Cox. It's under the fourth Cox,\nI'm sorry.\nMR. HOEBER: Which I will get to in just --\nQUESTION: Sorry. Sorry.\nMR. HOEBER: But Nike has the burden under\nASARCO to show that it -- if the Court gets to it, that it\nhas Article III standing, and I'll direct the Court's\nattention to the reply brief, page 6, and the only -- only\nfactor that Nike points to to show that it has Article III\nstanding is, and I quote, the certain injury Nike\nconfronts from having to defend its speech in this\nlitigation, and I will say that I do not believe that the\nprocess of litigation counts, or qualifies, or is\nsufficient to establish Article III standing. If it\nwere --\nQUESTION: You can't think of any civil scheme\nwhich is, on its face, so burdensome that it chills\nspeech? You can't think of anything?\nMR. HOEBER:\nwould be, Your Honor, perhaps -- no doubt, but the process\nof litigation. What I'm thinking of is in ASARCO, if the\nprocess of litigation itself were enough to establish\nArticle III standing, then the lessees would have had\nstanding from the moment they put it in the case --\nQUESTION: Well, but here the argument is, the\nprocess of litigation is what causes the substantive\ninjury --\nMR. HOEBER: Well, I think that -- that --\nQUESTION: -- to a First Amendment right, which\nis clearly something you have Article III standing to\nassert.\nMR. HOEBER: The -- but -- but going through the\nprocess of litigation, if it were a criminal case, the\narrest and the prosecution and the ultimate, possible\nconviction, but simply going through the litigation does\nnot distinguish --\nQUESTION: Well, that's the question on the\nmerits. They say it does.\nMR. HOEBER: The question on the merits being\nthe chilling effect of the California scheme --\nQUESTION: Imagine it was The New York Times --\nMR. HOEBER: -- not the -- not the litigation\nits -- not the process of litigation itself.\nQUESTION:\nwas the New York Times. Suppose it was a newspaper, I\nmean, you know, and somebody's trying to stop them from\nprinting an article, couldn't they get here under --\nunder similar circumstances?\nMR. HOEBER: Under ASARCO.\nQUESTION: Yes, I mean --\nMR. HOEBER: Under --\nQUESTION: I don't know if literally it's\nASARCO, but what we have is a -- is a plausible claim that\nspeech of an important political nature is being stopped.\nNow, that's their claim. Now, I -- I would have thought\nthere's a way to get the case here, and -- and why -- I\nmean --\nMR. HOEBER: Well -- well, what I'm saying is,\nthat may -- that may well be true, and it may well be true\nthat -- that a scheme can -- can stifle speech and\nestablish harm, but the -- the simple process of\nlitigation, responding to discovery and going through the\nlitigation is not what is stifling the speech. It's --\nQUESTION: Well, that's one of the issues in the\ncase.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, all right, then I'll move to\nmy second jurisdictional point, because I want to make\nsure it comes out, and this is under Cox, and that is,\nthere is no final judgment because this is a -- in a\ntraditional sense because this is the overruling of a\ndemurrer, but the fourth exception set forth in Cox\nprovides a way that this Court can hear a case in this\ncircumstance, but one of the conditions, necessary\nconditions is that were this Court to hear the case and\nreverse, that would put an end to the -- to the -- to the\nlitigation, at least to the relevant cause of action.\nHere, because it's a -- it's a demurrer, and the\nquestion is the sufficiency of the complaint against the\ndemurrer, Nike has to show that plaintiff could not amend\nthe complaint in response to, or respondent could not\namend the complaint in response to the -- whatever defect\nmight be --\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: I don't see that --\nQUESTION: -- that's what the intermediate court\nof appeals said in California. I would think that's\npretty good authority.\nMR. HOEBER: What the court of appeals said in\nCalifornia was that we could not amend the complaint, or\nthe facts in the -- in the complaint could not be amended\nto allege noncommercial speech, noncommercial speech, and\nthat's true.\nWe don't claim that we would allege\nnoncommercial speech.\ncovers commercial speech, and it's a red herring in that\nsense, where under us -- that we would lose the course of\naction and we couldn't proceed, so yes, the court of\nappeal did finish by saying, we don't see any reasonable\npossibility that the complaint can be amended to allege\nnoncommercial speech, so that --\nQUESTION: Okay, but let's -- let's assume it\ncould be amended in some way. The demurrer is to the\ncomplaint as it is, and if we accept their position, then\nyou cannot go forward with the complaint as it is. You\nwould have to modify your lawsuit by amendment or bring a\nnew one, and why isn't that sufficient for -- for the\nfourth Cox exception?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, it would -- the complaint as\nit is would not be sufficient, but what Cox says is, for\nthe -- for the fourth exception, that the court's ruling\nof reversal must be preclusive of further litigation on\nthe cause of action, so we gave the example --\nQUESTION: Well, the cause of action as pleaded.\nI mean, not a cause of action that you might have pleaded,\nor a different one that you might bring.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, it would be the cause -- the\ncause of action would remain as pleaded. If the court --\nif the court were to -- to say -- and we gave the example\nof negligence -- the court were to say strict liability\nis -- is unconstitutional, you must have a -- something\nmore than strict liability, you must have negligence, the\ncause of action would remain the same as --\nQUESTION: Well, I think we're --\nMR. HOEBER: -- as in libel cases --\nQUESTION: I think we're playing with words.\nYou simply could not go forward on the cause of action as\nyou stated that cause of action in your pleadings. You\nwould have to come forward with a cause of action which is\nin some respect different in order --\nMR. HOEBER: It would be more burdensome.\nQUESTION: -- in order to meet the\nconstitutional objection, and if that is the case, why\nisn't it sufficient under Cox IV that you could not\nproceed in the -- in the suit as you have pleaded it and\nbrought it?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, we're certainly not going to\nargue about words, and what -- that is certainly correct,\nthat if -- as pleaded, and -- and we pleaded under the\nstatute it's a -- it's strict liability, and if the Court\nwere to say, you must have negligence, we would amend the\ncomplaint to allege negligence, so it is certainly correct\nthat as pleaded we would not be proceeding on an\nas-pleaded. We would amend the complaint.\nWhat I -- what I'm saying is that as I\nunderstand the Cox exception, the point of it is that the\nCourt is saying that we will only take a case under\nCox IV, when we know that if we reverse, the case is over\non that -- on that cause of action, not the technicality\nof the pleading so much, but the reality of it, and if we\ncan amend the complain to allege the additional element,\nit's really the same -- it is the same cause of action.\nIt's just more burdensome.\nQUESTION: What you're saying is, is that Cox\ncategory has real teeth in it, and that you just can't --\nyou have to show that it's really going to be over.\nMR. HOEBER: Yes. My -- yes, I --\nQUESTION: But one aspect of it is that the\ndemurrer was granted without leave to repeat, as I\nunderstand it, was dismissed with prejudice.\nMR. HOEBER: Yes. In -- in San Francisco\nSuperior Court, the trial court, the judge granted the\ndemurrer without leave to amend. Under California law --\nand I should say, California law is not the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure.\nCalifornia law is the field code, the updated\nfield code, but it goes back to 1872, in fact to 1850, so\nunder California law, when the -- when the trial judge\ngranted the demurrer without leave to amend, we were\nentitled to, and we did appeal without seeking leave to\namend, and -- and under California law, and I -- I'll say\nthis in response to the statement on page 4 of the reply\nbrief that he makes no -- excuse me, that his abandonment\nof the claimed right to amend, we did not abandon.\nRespondent did not abandon any claimed right to amend.\nUnder California law, we are entitled to amend.\nWe didn't abandon it. I'm not sure how -- how we could\nabandon it. We felt we were right on the law, and we\nappealed from the -- from the superior court to the court\nof appeal. The court of appeal ruled against us and said,\nas I noted earlier, we don't see a possibility of\namended -- amending it to noncommercial speech, which we\nagree with.\nWe appealed to the California Supreme Court\nbecause we felt we were right on the law, and the\nCalifornia Supreme Court agreed with us. If -- if the\nCalifornia Supreme Court had said, you're wrong on the\nlaw, you've got to prove negligence, maybe the California\nSupreme Court would have done that. We would have then\namended the complaint and proved negligence.\nQUESTION: You're not going to be able to amend\nthe complaint in respect to at least one argument, which I\nthink is a substantial argument, and that's the argument\nthat this particular statement, whether made to the\ndirectors of the marketing, or whoever made it, is a\nstatement that plays a role in a public debate about what\nkind of society we wish to live in, and it's looking\ntowards action of a legislative sort, an administrative\nsort, or possibly an interdependent individual sort, like\na boycott, and that being a statement that plays that kind\nof role in a public debate, it is entitled to the highest\nprotection regardless of the forum it appeared in, so\nCalifornia cannot proceed.\nNow, in respect to that kind of an argument,\nwhat's your reply?\nMR. HOEBER: My -- my reply is, number 1, if --\nif this Court were to say the case is barred, of course we\ncouldn't amend. We could not amend, but -- so -- I'm\nnot -- I don't mean --\nQUESTION: I'm really trying to get you to the\nmerits.\nMR. HOEBER: Yes, I -- I'm going to -- I'm about\nto move to the merits. I'm -- so yes, there are\ncertain -- certainly circumstances we could not amend.\nNow, on the merits, and in direct response to --\nto your question, that's not this complaint. That is not\nthis complaint. Maybe there's a lot of statements in\nNike's briefs that suggest that's this case, and that's\nthis complaint, but the record before this Court is in\nthat complaint, and it's nowhere else.\nQUESTION: No, well, they say -- they're saying\ndon't look at -- look at the statement. It's the\nstatement we're talking about, and look at all their\nexamples, and the statement that Nike gave is\ncharacterized, according to them, as I characterized it,\nso they say, we don't care what it says in the complaint.\nThe complaint apparently would like us, something bad to\nhappen to us as a result of having made this statement.\nThat's enough for us. The First Amendment protects us\nfrom that bad thing.\nMR. HOEBER: Yes, and -- and --\nQUESTION: And why doesn't it?\nMR. HOEBER: And it doesn't because the\nstatements alleged in the complaint are specific, factual\nrepresentations that say, we make our products in\ncompliance with the laws of -- of the country of\nmanufacture with respect to wages and overtime, with\nrespect to health and safety, with respect to\nenvironmental standards, we pay our workers twice the\nminimum wage -- they are specific factual statements of\nthat kind. They are not statements that go beyond that,\nthat talk about globalization --\nQUESTION: How is your client hurt by that?\nMR. HOEBER: My client is here as -- as a\nPrivate Attorney General under the California provisions\nauthorizing --\nQUESTION: So he's -- so he's not hurt by it --\nMR. HOEBER: So he is not hurt by it. He has,\nas I said, no Article III standing. He -- he is not hurt\nby it. He is a Private Attorney General, and on the\nPrivate Attorney General point, I will -- I will say this,\non -- we said in our brief that it was not raised.\nQUESTION: If he's not hurt by that, how is\nanybody in California hurt by that?\nMR. HOEBER: Everybody in California will be\nhurt by it, or is hurt by it in exactly the same way that,\nunder this complaint as it would be if it had been brought\nby the California Attorney General or by the Federal Trade\nCommission.\nThe California statute, apart from the Private\nAttorney General provision, which is admittedly unusual,\nmaybe unique, but apart from the Private Attorney General\nprovision, the California statute is essentially the same\nas the Federal Trade Commission Act. Section 5 of the\nFederal Trade Commission Act and the California statute\nhave the same standard of liability, which is likely to\nmislead, or likely to deceive.\nThe Solicitor General's brief sets out the --\nthe standards on the Federal section 5. They're\nessentially the same, a claim that is likely to mislead\npeople, that's material, and so under section 5 under the\nCalifornia statute it is not required that -- that the\nplaintiff come in and prove actual deception, actual\ninjury, actual harm, so it's -- it's precisely the same\nunder either scheme.\nQUESTION: May I -- may I interrupt to go back\nto your article, your final judgment argument for just a\nmoment with respect to this? Supposing that we should\nhold that in a case like this, where you don't have\nArticle III standing, that the case may not go forward\nunless the plaintiff can meet the New York Times standard,\nprove actual malice and gross negligence and all the rest,\nbut it could theoretically go forward if those allegations\nwere made.\nMy question is, is it your understanding, as a\nmatter of California law and as a matter of the history of\nthis case, that you would have the right to -- to file an\namendment to your complaint making those allegations?\nMR. HOEBER: Absolutely. Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Well, then, if that's true, is it\nclear the case is not final, the judgment of law is not\nfinal?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, on the -- on the same grounds\nI said before, we -- if the court were to add an --\nQUESTION:\nthat no matter what you allege, New York Times or anything\nelse, these statements are constitutionally immune from\ncriticism in a proceeding of this kind. Only in that case\nwould the case really be final, if we held that.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, the case would certainly be\nfinal if the Court held that.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: We would not be able to amend the\ncase.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: It would be over.\nOn the Private Attorney General, because it is\nan unusual provision, I will only say this on -- on the\nquestion whether it was raised below. That's an easy --\nwe said in our brief it was not raised below. That is an\neasy matter to settle. Nike filed the brief. They filed\nthe brief in the California Supreme Court. It's their --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what if it weren't\nraised below. I mean, if a basic First Amendment\nchallenge to the statute is raised below, I mean, if you\nlose in the Supreme Court of California you're certainly\nnot just going to repeat exactly the same arguments.\nYou're going to think up some new ones.\nMR. HOEBER: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOEBER: I will only say as a matter of fact\nit was not raised below. The California Supreme Court did\nnot address it. It's not even in the cert petition. You\ncan look at pages 8, 9, and 19 to 23, and they've got a\ndifferent argument. It's not there. That's the fact.\nThe upshot of not raising it below, I'm assuming\nthe Court doesn't address arguments that were not\nraised below.\nQUESTION: Well, the Escondido case says there's\nsome latitude there.\nMR. HOEBER: And I -- and I -- I'm aware there's\nlatitude, and there's -- there's latitude as to what's an\nargument and what's a claim, but this is a very specific\nargument that the Private Attorney General provision is\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it correct that in the\ncourt below they did raise the point that, in fact, there\nwas no harm here, and one of the defects of the procedure\nwas that no one, either suing, or no one of the class on\nbehalf of whom suit was brought had or was alleged to have\nhad suffered any injury? That was in their argument,\nwasn't it?\nMR. HOEBER: Not that I recall. I don't recall\nthat argument. The --\nQUESTION:\nMR. HOEBER: Well, it -- it certainly would not\nraise to my mind an attack on the Private Attorney General\nprovision, but I mean, the Private Attorney General\nprovision is a well-known and well -- and well-understood\nprovision that stands out, and to -- to attack it, I think\nyou have to mention it.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, if -- the -- the\nargument is not merely that there is something magically\nwrong with a Private Attorney General. The argument is\nthat what's wrong with a Private Attorney General is that\nwithout public accountability, the Attorney General can\nsue without, in effect, showing any harm, so whether you\nuse the term or not, that's the guts of the argument, and\nif they raise the guts below, isn't that enough to -- to\nget them into court?\nMR. HOEBER: If they raised the guts below, it\nwould be enough.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: I -- I guess I would say they\ndidn't raise the guts below.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HOEBER: But if they did, yes, I --\nQUESTION: I would think out in California if a\nlitigant is challenging a statute as unconstitutional in\nevery instance, that you cannot have such an institution\nof a Private Attorney General, doesn't the Attorney\nGeneral weigh in on those cases?\nMR. HOEBER: Yes. The Attorney -- the Attorney\nGeneral in California under this statute, and it's not\njust for the Private Attorney General, but under the --\nthe false advertising and -- and unfair competition\nstatute, any time a -- a case gets on appeal the Attorney\nGeneral gets served with the briefs, so when we appealed\nin the first instance we served the Attorney General with\nour briefs, and we -- in the court of appeal and again in\nthe California Supreme Court, and the Attorney General\ncame in and filed an amicus brief in the California\nSupreme Court on our behalf, which of course only related\nto the merits, the commercial speech issue, which was the\nissue we were litigating.\nQUESTION: Not on the issue of whether you could\nhave --\nMR. HOEBER: No.\nQUESTION: -- this kind of animal.\nMR. HOEBER: No. No. No.\nI want to draw the Court's attention to -- to\nfootnote 3 in the reply brief. I think this may clarify\nsome matters, and -- and in particular the phrase in -- in\nfootnote 3 that says, public agencies.\nQUESTION: What page is that on?\nMR. HOEBER: I'm sorry, it's page 3, footnote 3,\nand the reference to public agencies.\nThe argument that -- that the Private Attorney\nGeneral provision is unconstitutional because we don't\nhave any injury, and allege no injury, and it's -- and\nit's unconstitutional, the result of that argument is that\nrespondent is an improper plaintiff, is just -- doesn't --\ndoesn't meet constitutional requirements as an improper\nplaintiff.\nIf the Court were to hold that, then there are\nno further issues for this Court, and that is why I\ndirect -- I focus on footnote 3, because in footnote 3, as\nI -- as I read it, Nike is saying that even if the Court\nholds that the Private Attorney General provision is\nunconstitutional because the plaintiff has no injury,\nnevertheless the Court should go on because there will be\nfuture lawsuits filed by public agencies, and the Court\nshould go on to impose a scienter requirement deliberate\nor reckless falsehood.\nAnd I want to say that those public agencies,\nwhich is another word for law enforcement, which would be\nCalifornia Attorney General, the district attorneys, and\nnot only California, other States and the FTC, they are\nnot before the Court. Those parties are not before the\nCourt.\nIf -- if respondent is an improper plaintiff, there aren't\nany further issues, and we can't --\nQUESTION: Can I --\nQUESTION: Well, you try to have it both ways.\nYou say, well I'm here because I'm a Private Attorney\nGeneral, but I -- I can't really try this case as well as\nan Attorney General could.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, no -- no --\nQUESTION: That seems to me quite inconsistent.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, I don't want to say that,\nYour Honor. I want to say that -- that if we turn to the\nmerits of this case and -- and get away from the Private\nAttorney General, if the Private Attorney General is\nconstitutional, then respondent is in the same shoes as\nthe Federal Trade Commission or the California Attorney\nGeneral, and that as far as the merits, go there is no\ndifference.\nI said earlier that the California statute,\nstatutory scheme is the same as section 5.\nQUESTION: Well, I accept that. I want to get\nyou just back once more if I can, and you may have nothing\nto add, but I -- suppose we have to get to what I find in\nthis case personally the hardest question, I think that\nthe Federal Trade Commission certainly has the right to\nregulate unfair, deceptive advertising, particularly on\nmatters of -- of, that you're trying to sell the product,\nincluding those having to do with, say, the environment.\nI also think that the First Amendment is\ndesigned to protect all participants in a public debate,\nand public debates, contrary, in my mind, to what you said\nbefore, are made up of factual statements, primarily, so\nonce you tie a party's hands behind his back in respect to\nfacts, you've silenced him.\nNow, if all parties should participate equally\nunder the First Amendment, and also you should be able to\nhave regulation by the FTC of deceptive advertising, how\ndo I draw that line?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, in this case, the reason I\nsay -- and I'm not trying to carve out facts as different\nfrom, necessarily different from anything else. The facts\nhere were representations about the conditions under which\nthe product was made.\nQUESTION: I know, and I think --\nMR. HOEBER: All right. Now, those --\nQUESTION: Now, but that's not going to help me.\nMR. HOEBER: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: What I'm really looking for is help\nin writing a hypothetical opinion. I have to write a\nstandard, or a rule, or a statement, and I know that\n30 briefs here, which are excellent, have tried to get at\nthat, but I'm still in my mind uncertain about, say, your\nview or the others on what that sentence should say,\ntrying to distinguish the ones from the others.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, this case, and I -- and I'll\nstart with a focus here, the -- the debate in this case\nthat's in the complaint, and the only debate that's in the\ncomplaint, is the debate over what, in fact, was going on\nin the shoe factories, what in fact, were the conditions.\nThat was the debate.\nNow, that debate is not the same as a public\ndebate about a larger public issue. It is a debate about\nthis company's actual practices.\nQUESTION: But is -- is it different for First\nAmendment purposes?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, I think -- I think it has to\nbe, Your Honor, because the -- the company is making\nrepresentations to consumers about its own practices for\nthe purpose of convincing those consumers that they should\nbuy the company's products, so it is commercial speech in\nthat sense.\nQUESTION: Whereas if it --\nMR. HOEBER: It is not -- it is not a --\nQUESTION: Whereas if it were about\nglobalization and what is happening in these countries it\nwould be different for First Amendment purposes?\nMR. HOEBER: Yes. It would not be about the\ncompany's -- this -- these statements are about the\ncompany's products, the conditions under which the\nproducts are made.\nQUESTION: What difference would that make?\nI -- I really haven't been clear on what difference it\nmakes whether it's commercial or noncommercial. So long\nas it's false, and so long as it misleads somebody --\nMR. HOEBER: Well, the Court has said that if it\nis --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: -- that if it is commercial speech\nand it's false or misleading, it's not protected by the\nFirst Amendment. I -- I --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: It's also true that false factual\nstatements have no constitutional --\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, even if it's not\ncommercial speech, if somebody misleads me, to my\ndetriment, with a false statement, I wouldn't have a cause\nof action?\nMR. HOEBER: Yes, you would have a cause of\naction. You would certainly have a cause of action,\nand -- and if I sold you a watch and told you it was made\nin the United States and you relied on that and bought it\nfrom me and I lied, or -- or even if I innocently told you\nthat, you could rescind the transaction.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the only way I can rely to\nmy detriment is if -- if it is commercial speech? I mean,\nit seems to me if I rely on a -- on a statement that --\nthat the person expects me to rely on, and I do so, and it\nharms me, I have a cause of action. I -- does it really\nmatter --\nMR. HOEBER: I -- I --\nQUESTION: -- whether it's commercial or\nnoncommercial speech?\nMR. HOEBER: I suspect it does not, for a -- for\na cause of action alleging reliance to my detriment and --\nQUESTION: Can you think of any case that this\nCourt has decided in which the outcome has depended on\nwhether or not the speech was commercial, other than the\ncase the California Supreme Court decided?\nMR. HOEBER: There -- there is a paucity of\nauthority from this Court that was --\nQUESTION: I wonder if there's any at all.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOEBER: -- directly on point.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: No.\nThe case that -- that was most important, and\nthis maybe gets back to Justice Breyer's point, for our\npurposes would be the Egg Commission case -- the Egg\nCommission case, the National Commission on Egg Nutrition,\nbecause there was a product and there were attacks on the\nproduct saying it caused -- that the cholesterol was bad,\nand this is 25 years ago, and it was new, and -- and the\nFederal Trade -- and the egg industry fought back and said\nno, eggs -- eggs are helpful in nutrition, and -- and they\ndon't harm, so that was a case where you had a dispute, or\na debate about the product.\nQUESTION: Yes, but where I am really is, I -- I\nthink it's possible to look at the commercial speech cases\nas creating a doctrine with an exception, and it's the\nunfair advertising that falls outside the doctrine, so all\nwe know is, we're back to square 1 as far as the\ncommercial speech doctrine is concerned, so let's face it\nas if there were no such doctrine and try to figure out\nhow under the First Amendment we get proper standards.\nMR. HOEBER: Well --\nQUESTION: And that -- and that's what I'm\ntrying to figure out.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, I -- yes. If -- if the Court\nwants to do that in this case, on this record --\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't know if we want to do\nit or not do it.\ngo about it if I ended up thinking we should go about it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOEBER: Then -- then my suggestion is that\nthis case alleges specific representations about a -- a\ncompany's products, namely the conditions under which they\nwere made. Consumers rely on those representations. The\nSolicitor General agrees with that. They rely on those\nrepresentations, and they rely on them in making decisions\nas to whether or not to buy the company's products.\nWhen companies make representations about their\nproducts with the purpose of consumers relying on those\nrepresentations, and consumers do rely on those\nrepresentations, it violates section 5 of the Federal\nTrade Commission Act, it violates the California statute,\nand it ought to be subject to regulation.\nQUESTION: Well, just becomes something\nviolates -- you're suggesting that if it -- if it's\ncontrary to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\nsurely it must be constitutional, but I'm not sure -- I\ndon't know that we've ever said that everything in the\nFederal Trade Commission Act is constitutional.\nMR. HOEBER: No, I'm sure the Court has not said\nthat, and I -- and I'm -- and I --\nQUESTION: Let's --\nQUESTION: Go on.\nQUESTION: Let's assume a -- a law that --\nthat -- I -- I guess that -- that there were, that -- that\nrequires advertising on radio or television to be\nsupported, that you -- you cannot make the claim unless\nthe claim is supported, all right, and the burden is on\nyou to have the support before you can even make it, and\nit's a violation, even -- even if it happens to be true,\nif -- if you have not done the studies that show that this\nlittle pill does this thing or -- or another, you cannot\nmake the statement.\nNow, I suppose we would allow that in -- in\nadvertising, wouldn't we? But would we allow such a --\nsuch a precondition to -- to speech in -- in a\nnoncommercial area?\nMR. HOEBER: I'm sure -- I suspect not.\nQUESTION: So there is a difference between what\nwe're willing to do with commercial speech and\nnoncommercial speech, but why -- why wouldn't we limit it,\nlimit the term commercial speech in that context to\nadvertising, to really -- and -- and some of our cases\nspeak that way. It has to be the context of the offering\nof a -- of a transaction, the offering of a deal.\nSo that if you have some general, you know,\nadvertising on television, we're a -- we're a -- an\nenvironmentally concerned company, it doesn't fall within\ncommercial speech. It's only if in connection -- you\nknow, on the -- on the label it says, buy this because, or\nyou know, it's a pitch to sell the product.\nIsn't that a line that it's feasible to draw,\nand why isn't that a sensible line?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, it may be feasible to draw.\nI -- I imagine it would be difficult to draw, and I think\nthat's why the Federal Trade Commission says advertising,\nproduct labels, other promotions and marketing material,\nbecause it in many instances is not easy to draw --\nQUESTION: Well, the California Supreme Court\ndefined commercial speech as speech when a person is\nengaged in commerce. Just generally, is that their basis?\nMR. HOEBER: Oh, I think the California Supreme\nCourt was trying to spell out what it -- what it --\nQUESTION: Do you defend the California Supreme\nCourt's --\nMR. HOEBER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- definition?\nMR. HOEBER: We don't need to go as far as the\nCalifornia Supreme Court may have gone, in particular with\nits definition of product references, because I think the\nCalifornia Supreme Court was concerned about so-called\nimage advertising and the possible ways companies promote\nthemselves apart from this particular product.\nQUESTION: Well, if it -- if this case -- if we\nreach the merits, and if we have to address it, we're\ngoing to have to know what commercial speech is, I\nsuppose.\nMR. HOEBER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And we're going to have to look at\nCalifornia's definition.\nMR. HOEBER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I just wondered if you supported\nthat.\nMR. HOEBER: Well, we support it, but we don't\nhave to go as far, because in this -- because we have\nrepresentations about the product, the -- the\ncircumstances under which the product was made.\nWe certainly agree that --\nQUESTION: None of this speech was advertising\nin the true sense of that term, was it?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, if the true sense means\nadvertising format, no, these were not in advertising\nformat, but for example, the -- the -- one of the exhibits\nis the -- is a primer, a 30-page primer, which looks for\nall the world like the kind of promotional brochures and\nmarketing material that's handed out by lots of companies.\nNow, it's not an advertisement on television,\nand -- and that line may be feasible to draw, or it may --\nmay have fuzzy edges, but it's going to leave out a lot of\npromotions and a lot of communications that consumers rely\non.\nQUESTION: Yes. It's not a perfect world.\nMR. HOEBER: No. No.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But it's worse -- it's worse,\nactually, because I think your case, the truth of the\nmatter is, I think it's both. You know, it's both.\nThey're both trying to sell their product and they're\ntrying to make a statement that's relevant to a public\ndebate.\nMR. HOEBER: Maybe the --\nQUESTION: And so what do we do if we're drawing\nthis standard, and there's a wide range of things that\nquite honestly fall into both?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, my -- my position is that\nit's -- consumer protection is --\nQUESTION: Trumps the First Amendment?\nMR. HOEBER: Not that it trumps the First\nAmendment --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOEBER: -- but -- but the hypothetical is,\nit's both.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's right.\nMR. HOEBER: And -- and if it were just the --\nif it was -- if it was -- companies -- the Court has said\nthat companies have the right, or speakers have the right\nto comment directly on public issues, and -- and if you\ncomment directly on a public issue and discuss the public\nissue, you are certainly protected.\nQUESTION: If it's very difficult to define\ncommercial speech, then isn't it true that under this\nscheme companies are chilled in speaking?\nMR. HOEBER: Well, they -- they may be chilled\nin speaking if -- because of the difficulty in defining\ncommercial speech, and that presumably will chill false\nstatements as well, since the -- the statute and the\nregulation only applies to false or misleading speech,\nand -- and I think that to the extent the -- the\ndefinition is -- is unclear, it may -- I don't know that\nfor a fact, but it's -- it's plausible.\nQUESTION: Are -- are there cases where we've\nupheld statutes that are chilling of speech?\nMR. HOEBER: Oh yes. Yes, there are.\nQUESTION: What are they?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOEBER: Well --\nQUESTION: We haven't said that they're chilling\nof speech.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOEBER: I think you caught me there, Your\nHonor.\nOn -- back to -- to Justice Breyer's question.\nI don't think anybody would say defining commercial speech\nis easy, but in this case, where we allege that -- where\nthe complaint alleges that the company made factual\nrepresentations about its -- the circumstances under which\nits products are made, with the purpose of persuading\nconsumers to buy the product, and we know that consumers\nwant that information and rely on that information, that\nshould fit within any reasonable definition of commercial\nspeech. If --\nQUESTION: Are you saying that you can't\ndistinguish what you are targeting from, say, a label that\nsays, made by disabled veterans, when it wasn't? You --\nyou put them in the same category?\nMR. HOEBER: I put that in the commercial speech\ncategory.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hoeber.\nMR. HOEBER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me just deal with a couple of technical\nthings first. The Attorney General of California was\nnotified below. He filed a brief. It's not required in\nCalifornia that all of the arguments be rehearsed before\nhim, and most importantly the California Supreme Court\npassed on the fundamental claim that this scheme, applied\nto public debate, violates the First Amendment, and under\nYee v. Escondido in any event we can make a different\nargument.\nBut if you look at the brief below, the most\ntelling part of it, I think -- and it gets to the pivot of\nthis case -- this is at pages 30 to 31 of the California\nSupreme Court brief. It there recites that if the shoe,\nas it were, were on the other foot, under California law\nthis case would go away in an instant.\nThe case decided unanimously by the Supreme\nCourt of California in 1984 is Epic v. Superior Court. In\nthat case there was an ideological boycott of companies\nthat were doing business with the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff was not thought to be environmentally friendly\nenough. The plaintiff sued for trade libel, they wanted\ndamages, they wanted an injunction, they said it was\ninterference with contract. The trial court was about to\nhold the trial and the Supreme Court of California, citing\nArticle 1, section 2 of its constitution, said, hey,\npublic debate, there are interests on both sides, but the\ncourts of California can't resolve it.\nIt seems to me that what we have here, and this\ngoes to the question of the Private Attorney General\naction, is that if there is a debate between interests of\nlabor and interests of management, the California Supreme\nCourt has transmogrified this old statute, which was\npretty strange to begin with but had never been used to\nstifle and silence the public debate, it's transformed it\ninto a conversation-stopper, and the power to do that is,\nI think, extraordinary.\nThey say, maybe there will be a chill. If you\nlook at the media brief, the media are now saying that\nbusinesses around the world are already afraid to\ncommunicate with us because California may get them, and\nthe European brief, filed by a consortium that controls\nabout $2 trillion of investment, says that the efforts of\nthe European Union to encourage transparency are being\nfrustrated by California saying that if you come out and\nanswer these charges, as they did in the letter to the\nathletic directors, you can be trapped, because you're a\nbusiness, so you're trying to make money, so it's\ncommercial speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:\n"
