        "content": "(11:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 07-610, Locke v. Karass.\nMr. Young.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case addresses whether the First and\nFourteenth Amendments permit public employers to compel\nnonunion employees to subsidize the union's expressive\nspeech of a political nature in a public forum,\nspecifically litigation in courts and before\nadministrative agencies not involving their bargaining\nunit.\nWe submit that the answer to this question\nis no, a result supported by the Court's unanimous,\nunambiguous, and categorical holding in Ellis. In\nEllis, this Court held that, to avoid constitutional\nproblems, nonmembers under the Railway Labor Act could\nnot be forced to subsidize any litigation not arising\nwithin their bargaining unit, not even litigation to\nenforce another bargaining unit's agreement in\nbankruptcy proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, of course, they\nwouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some\nkind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme. They --\nthey contribute to the national union, and in exchange\nthe national union defends their interest just as it\ndefends the interest of other unions. You didn't\naddress that -- that pooling argument.\nMR. YOUNG: I would respectfully disagree,\nJustice Scalia, but my answer to your question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me fair\nto call it \"subsidizing\" if, in fact, that's what's\ngoing on.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, it is also not fair,\nJustice Scalia, to call it \"insurance.\" It's\naffiliation, and the answer to the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know because that\nwasn't inquired into by the court below. I guess we\nreally -- we really don't know, do we, when -- whether\nthe local union can make any demands upon the -- upon\nthe national union for -- for litigation defense?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, I think we can rely,\nJustice Scalia, on the admissions contained in MSEA's\nbrief, which clearly concedes that, in fact, SEIU has no\nenforceable obligations under its affiliation\narrangement with MSEA.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if we don't call it\n\"insurance,\" can we all it \"pooling\"?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, of course, that -- that is\nwhat they call it, Justice Kennedy. And -- and -- and\npooling is -- is certainly something that we believe the\nCourt rejected in Ellis when it set forth a categorical\nrule.\nThe pooling argument was raised in the\nbriefs in Ellis, and this Court did not see fit to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Young, I thought that\nin Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that\nthat litigation did not have as its subject matter\nnegotiation or administration of a collective bargaining\ncontract.\nMR. YOUNG: I don't believe that's the case,\nJustice Ginsburg, because Ellis dealt with enforcing a\nbargaining agreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm quoting from -- I'm\nquoting from that decision at page 453. The case\ninvolved litigation \"not involving negotiation or\nadministration of a collective bargaining contract.\"\nMR. YOUNG: Well, of course, Justice\nGinsburg, the -- some of the litigation did involve\nenforcing another bargaining unit's agreement in\nbankruptcy proceedings. I don't know how that is not\nenforcing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are you saying the\nCourt got it wrong? I mean, the words that I'm quoting\nare from the opinion: \"Not involving negotiation or\nadministration of a collective bargaining contract.\"\nMR. YOUNG: Well, that -- that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the only thing\nthat could be germane. If it doesn't relate to that,\nthen your case is solid.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, I'm trying -- I'm -- I'm\ntrying to find the specific language, Justice Ginsburg,\nand I apologize for my inadequacy in this regard. But I\nthink the point that we -- I think the point that we\nwould rely on in Ellis in -- in -- in the very paragraph\nthat you referred to is the specificity with which this\nCourt discussed what was chargeable. It referred to the\ncontract, for instance. It referred to the exclusive\nrepresentative twice; not an exclusive representative,\nbut the exclusive representative. It referred to the\nbargaining unit not less than five times in that single\nparagraph in discussing what was permissible under the\nRailway Labor Act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you want to stand or fall\non the all-or-nothing argument that nonmembers can never\nbe required to pay for any extra-unit litigation\nexpenses, or do you have an -- an additional argument?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, no, Justice Alito. We\nbelieve -- we believe that the -- the Ellis standard is\nthe constitutional standard as both principal opinions\nin Lehnert discuss.\nIn -- in Lehnert, Justice Blackmun\nspecifically recognized it in his -- in his plurality\nopinion; and Justice Scalia himself said there was good\nreason -- good cause to treat Ellis as stating the\nconstitutional rule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you take -- do you\ntake that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't\nbuy litigation insurance?\nMR. YOUNG: Real insurance, Justice Souter?\nI think that -- obviously that would be a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Some of those -- some of\nthose premiums are going to subsidize the defense in --\nin -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit. In fact,\nmost of it will.\nMR. YOUNG: Well -- but the distinction,\nJustice Souter, I think is discussed in the brief,\namicus brief, filed by Pacific Legal Foundation. For\none thing, it would not be the labor union that would be\n-- another labor union receiving those insurance funds.\nIt would be a third-party insurer, presumably. That\nwould be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so in your view,\nthen, even if the agreement with the -- with the parent\nunion in this case involved an explicit obligation on\nthe part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if\nlitigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?\nMR. YOUNG: It would add the -- the insult\nof the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not interested in\ninsults. Is it -- is it constitutional, or isn't it?\nMR. YOUNG: We believe it would not be if\nthe international affiliate were the insurer, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- and -- and -- and\nyou do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance\npolicy issued by an insurer would not violate the\nconstitutional standard?\nMR. YOUNG: That -- that is the -- that is\nour argument, Justice Souter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though -- even\nthough there may be a great disconnect between the\npremiums and the needs of the particular unit? I mean,\nlet's say the particular unit has -- I don't know -- has\nalways had a history of good relations with the\nemployer. It has never had to call upon litigation in\n20 years, and they don't anticipate it, and yet their\ninsurance premiums rise dramatically because of very\nhostile and extended litigation by another unit. Do you\n-- do you concede that case?\nMR. YOUNG: I -- I don't think -- well, I\ndon't think I would concede the premise of your\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- and I think that\npoint is -- is discussed fairly thoroughly in Pacific\nLegal Foundation's brief.\nA rate setting in an insurance context is --\nis radically different than the affiliations fee setting\nin this context. Rate -- and -- and much more about\ninsurance than, frankly, I know; but it -- it certainly\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's based on the\nexperience of the whole -- the whole cohort of insureds.\nMR. YOUNG: It's also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Chief Justice's\nquestion says: Can a -- can a -- a local that is\ncertainly on the basis of past experience not going to\nneed this insurance nearly as much as other locals --\ncan it enter into an insurance arrangement with other\nlocals to buy the insurance for all of the locals even\nthough it knows that it won't benefit very much from\nthat insurance policy?\nMR. YOUNG: I'm sorry. I misunderstood.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was -- he was trying\nto help you.\nMR. YOUNG: And I'm sorry, Chief Justice\nRoberts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have said, yes,\nChief Justice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YOUNG: And -- and I -- and I appreciate\nthe help, Mr. Chief Justice, and your pointing that out,\nJustice Scalia. My -- I -- I misunderstood the\nquestion, and I apologize.\nYes, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- the -- our\npoint would be, however, that in that type of\nrelationship and I -- as I said, that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean that each\ntime they buy an insurance policy they have to\ninvestigate which locals are going to get the most\nbenefit out of it?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, I don't think that's a --\nthat's a decision for the locals. That's the insurer\nsetting rates, and -- and I -- I don't know of a market,\nquite honestly, Justice Stevens, for that type of\ninsurance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you give one answer\nto the Chief Justice on the facts he gave and a\ndifferent one if the record showed that everybody got a\nproportional benefit out of the group policy?\nMR. YOUNG: I don't -- no, Justice Stevens.\nI don't think my question -- my answer would differ. I\nthink, however --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your answer doesn't\ndepend, then, on the facts that he included in that\nquestion?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He is not trying to\nhelp you.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure he was,\neither.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, one looks for it where one\ncan find it, Justice Stevens and Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe differing -- I think that the\ndistinction has to be made here between insurance on the\none hand and affiliation. There -- in -- in the\ninsurance context you have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean all\ninsurance policies are bad?\nMR. YOUNG: No, no, no. I -- I -- I concede\ninsurance, Justice Stevens. I -- my point -- if it is\ntrue insurance, insurance where there is mutuality of\nobligation.\nThe difficulty that this Court, I believe,\nfound in the Ellis case when it set a bright-line test\nwas that it was public -- and I -- and I think can be\ndiscerned from the Court's other cases, including\nGlickman -- is we're talking about public speech, speech\nof a political nature in a public forum.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there was -- there\nwas mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I\ngave you in which the agreement with the parent union\nrequired an affirmative obligation of the parent union\nto come in and defend if litigation arose. And you said\nthat still would not be constitutional.\nMR. YOUNG: And I -- and I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- so the criterion\nhas got to be something other than mutuality of\nobligation, right?\nMR. YOUNG: And it assuredly is, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And what is the other\ndistinction?\nMR. YOUNG: The other distinction has to be\nthat it is not -- it is -- the problem also arises from\nthe nature of the forced relationship. As this Court\nhas recognized in cases such as Ellis and Abood,\nallowing the agency shop at all works an infringement on\nFirst Amendment rights.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we -- we start with\nthat premise, but what is the other distinction, then?\nIf it is not mutuality of obligation, what -- what is\nthe -- what is the -- the -- the -- the point that\nseparates the -- the sheep from the goats here?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, the mutuality of\nobligation coupled with true rate setting in the sense\nthat there is a -- there is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is -- what has\nrate setting got to do with -- with your basic point?\nYour basic point, as I understand it, is that some of\nthe money that's being taken from the -- from the local\nunion and in our example subsidized by the service fee\nis being used to subsidize litigation for other unions.\nAnd that is, it seems to me, exactly true in the\ninsurance case.\nSome of those premiums will subsidize\nlitigation -- speech -- involving speech in -- in other\nunion bargaining areas. What's the distinction?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, the distinction, Justice\nSouter, would be that there is -- it doesn't seem to me\nthat there is a -- there is a larger pool created than\njust a union litigation pool in the insurance context.\nFurthermore, the -- the -- the money, in fact, is spread\nabout --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether that's\ntrue or not. If you buy labor litigation insurance I\nsuppose it is not. Don't they set their rates with\nrespect to the experience in labor litigation, not in --\non their experience with automobile accidents.\nMR. YOUNG: I don't know of an insurance\ncompany that's quite that specific, Justice Souter, nor\nhave I ever heard of labor -- labor union insurance --\nlabor litigation insurance. So I'm not sure that such a\nmarket actually exists.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Neither do I.\nMR. YOUNG: Certainly there is not on this\nrecord that would suggest so, sir.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I did want to understand\nyour position. Suppose there is a statewide contract\nfor public employees and one union brings a suit to\ninterpret a provision of that collective bargaining\nagreement having to do with overtime or holidays or\nsomething. And then it notifies the other union, we're\ngoing to have to drop this litigation because we can't\nafford it. Even though it ultimately may affect you\ndown the line, you're not a party. I don't see the harm\nin allowing the other union to subsidize or\ncontribute -- use whatever verb you want -- that\nlitigation -- that litigation.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, of course if the other\nunion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what -- what harm\nare we trying to prevent here?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, obviously First Amendment\nharm, Justice Kennedy. But I think understanding -- if\nI understand your hypothetical --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The First Amendment can\nbe -- can be a sword or a shield. This union wants to\nuse it as a sword in order to promote, in order to\nprotect its rights under the collective bargaining\nagreement. I don't see the harm.\nMR. YOUNG: Excuse me, Justice Kennedy. I'm\nsorry for interrupting you.\nCertainly the union has the right to\nassociate as it sees fit. The First Amendment protects\nthat right. We are not suggesting that it doesn't have\nthe right to go out and ask other labor unions to\ncontribute to its litigation activities.\nWhat the First Amendment -- the -- the First\nAmendment right to not speak is -- is involved when, in\nthe words of the Ninth Circuit in one of these cases,\n\"they seek to mulch from the unwilling moneys for their\nspeech activities in a public forum.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I don't understand\nabout --\nMR. YOUNG: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Finish because there's\nsomething --\nMR. YOUNG: Thank you, sir. And my point\nwould be under the hypothetical as I understand it, you\nposed a union in -- within the State under the same\nbargaining agreement being asked to support for\nlitigation under one of the other locals. I can think\nof a number of cases where that's actually the case, two\nlocals under one bargaining agreement just in my own\nexperience. And so you're not suggesting something\nthat's unusual.\nI think under that circumstances that would\nfall squarely within Ellis' rule. It involves the\nbargaining agreement. It may not involve the specific\nbargaining unit, but it is concerning the bargaining\nagreement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not quite the\nhypothetical. Let's say there are two bargaining\nagreements but they're identical, and that this\nlitigation that's underway will have persuasive force\nfor the union that's thinking about entering, and then\nthe union decides that it is going to enter to help the\nunion involved in the suit, and the members of the, of\nthe contributing union object and you say they have a\nFirst Amendment right. That's your point?\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't see why the\nobjects of collective bargaining the, objects of\nunion -- of the union, are not being fulfilled.\nMR. YOUNG: Because that goes beyond the\nfree rider rationale which justifies the agency shop in\nthe earlier cases such as Hansen and Street. The free\nrider that the Congress was concerned with -- and of\ncourse, it's been adopted through Abood to apply to the\nStates -- the free rider that Congress was concerned\nwith is the free rider that is required to accept the\nunion's services and refuses to subsidize those\nservices. And the -- this Court in discussing that in\nterms of lobbying and public relations activities found\nthat the relationship was too attenuated.\nObviously judicial decisionmaking and\nadministrative decisionmaking is good for its persuasive\neffect in many different contexts. But that -- that\nrelationship was found to be too attenuated in Ellis and\nwith regard to litigation and certainly in Lehnert with\nregard to public relations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the part I don't\nunderstand. It's not your fault. I don't understand it\nin the cases either. What First Amendment right are we\ntalking about? There is an individual who, under the\nagency shop, pays dues to a union. Now, suppose the\nunion uses some of that money in a way that has nothing\nto do with politics, nothing to do with speech, but it\ndoesn't happen to benefit that particular member.\nFor example, you can have a central union\nheadquarters 4,000 miles away where there's a librarian\nwho's doing research on a matter that will help lots of\npeople, but nobody in this area. Or you could have a\nprogram to commemorate the people who were hurt in the\nState of Hawaii at a union uprising or strike of some\nkind where nobody in this particular area is ever going\nto go.\nNow, both of those activities are totally\nlegitimate union activities that have nothing to do with\npolitics. But this particular place won't benefit from\nthem. Okay, what in the First Amendment prohibits the\nunion from paying for such an activity out of general\nunion dues assessed on everybody? And why would the\nFirst Amendment prohibit such a thing?\nMR. YOUNG: Under Lehnert, Justice Breyer,\nthe expenditures which you posit would be chargeable and\nare not at issue here. `\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If they are\nchargeable because they have nothing to do with\npolitics, perfectly legitimate, why isn't it also\nchargeable to pay for the costs of a lawsuit which has\nnothing to do with politics, totally for a union\npurpose, it just doesn't happen to benefit that person\nwho's miles away in a different local?\nMR. YOUNG: Because benefit has never been\nthe touchstone. And under Ellis and under Lehnert and\ncertain pluralities --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to tell me\nabout cases. I'm abstracting from -- I want to know the\nreasoning. I want to know why.\nMR. YOUNG: Because we are talking about\npublic -- political speech of a public nature.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I said there is no politics\nin any of these expenditures. 42 bishops would swear\nthere is nothing here that has anything to do with\npolitics.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why does it have to be\npolitical speech? Isn't it enough that it is simply\nspeech that certain people don't want to subsidize, or\nspeech, so that the commemoration in Hawaii may be\nsomething that 99.999 percent of the population would\nfind very commendable, but someone is being forced to\npay for that?\nMR. YOUNG: And I may --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's the reasoning\nthat you seem to accept and I guess all human activity\nis banned. Because to my knowledge, all human activity\ntakes place through speech with a few exceptions that\nare not here relevant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't banned.\nIt's just -- just -- you know, you don't force the\nnonunion member who indeed may be anti-union to pay for\nit. And he doesn't want to subsidize the union\nlibrarian. He doesn't like unions here. He doesn't\nlike unions in Hawaii. And for the government to force\nhim to -- to support the union is, I thought, part of\nthe reasoning behind --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'd be interested in your\ncomments on this dialogue.\nMR. YOUNG: I'd be happy to jump in here\nsomewhere, Justice Stevens. I appreciate the colloquy.\nAnd I think the distinction -- getting back to the point\nJustice Alito raised, and the sharp distinction that has\nbeen made in the compelled speech and compelled dues\ncases is between the activities -- certainly in the\ncompelled union dues cases, is activities for which\nnonmembers are compelled to accept the union as\nbargaining representative.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why isn't\nlitigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a\nline between the -- the negotiation of an agreement,\nwhere Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the\nenforcement of the agreement. I mean, we're not talking\nabout litigation unrelated to collective bargaining. It\nis only litigation that deals with the meaning of a term\nin the contract, whether what the employer has done was\nan unfair labor practice, whether there has been a\ncontractual violation.\nMR. YOUNG: For the -- I'm sorry, Justice\nGinsburg. For the agreement, for the unit, we concede\nthat the union may charge for that public speech of a\npolitical nature in a public forum. We have no dispute\nover charging for enforcing or -- or -- enforcing the\ncollective bargaining agreement. That is not our\ndispute.\nThe dispute here is only over expenditures\non behalf of other bargaining units, where we believe\nEllis said it was too attenuated, but because it is\nnot -- my point would be that the litigation which is\nacceptably chargeable -- I think the presumptive -- I\nthink the default value in this Court's decisionmaking\non litigation is that it's nonchargeable. However, the\nCourt has drawn a narrow exception for that public\nspeech in public forum which is related to the union's\nduties as, not related to but in performance of the\nunion's duties as bargaining agent the duties for which\nlaw imposes the union as a bargaining agent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand why\nenforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there\nyou agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision\nyou can't have these pooling arrangements. What's the\ndifference between negotiating an agreement and\nlitigation to enforce it.\nMR. YOUNG: I think that would go back as\nfar as Justice Marshall and Marbury. It would be an\nempty right if the union were able to negotiate an\nagreement it wouldn't be permitted to enforce. Begins\nbegins that's, that's my point. I can't see the\ndifference between saying pooling is okay when we're\ndealing with negotiating an agreement, but it's not okay\nwhen we're dealing with enforcing it.\nThe distinction is, Justice Ginsburg, that\nthe negotiation of the agreement does not occur in a\npublic forum, whereas litigation does, and that's the\ndistinction we would draw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the\ndistinction you were drawing was whether or not the\ncollective bargaining agreement applies to the\nparticular union. If it's a different unit with a\ndifferent agreement I thought you were saying that that\ncan't be charged, but if it's the bargaining agreement\nthat binds the particular unit, I thought you said that\nwas chargeable.\nMR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry if\nI was confusing. I thought I was very specific. It is\nchargeable for litigation involving the bargaining\nagreement. We don't dispute that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the particular\nunit.\nMR. YOUNG: Of the particular unit. That is\nnot in dispute here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose you\nwould also concede that if the bargaining agreement is\nexactly the same, you know a number of units have\nexactly the same bargaining agreement, which I would\nsuppose is a not uncommon situation, but litigation with\nrespect to the terms of the bargaining agreement even\nthough it happens to involve a different unit is also\nchargeable to the particular unit.\nMR. YOUNG: No, Mr. Chief Justice, we would\nnot concede that. We believe that this Court in Ellis\ndrew a bright line, and I think that's clear in Ellis'\ndiscussion of the mutual aid pact which was not\nchargeable in Ellis, found not chargeable in Ellis. The\ndistinction that I think this Court has drawn or that\nshould I would respectfully suggest should be drawn is\nthat -- is a narrow one. It's consistent with strict\nscrutiny and this Court's jurisprudence in that area.\nOnly for speech which is narrowly related to the union's\nduties as bargaining agent and performance of those\nduties can public speech -- can charging nonmembers for\npublic political speech in a public forum be justified.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean, because I\nwant to be sure -- you exclude the librarian example of\nJustice Breyer?\nMR. YOUNG: The librarian I think would fall\nunder the general Lehnert test.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So which side? You have\nto be clear with me.\nMR. YOUNG: There were a lot of sides there,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you to be\nsaying they could not charge the nonmember for the\nexpenses of the Hawaiian librarian.\nMR. YOUNG: I think it was the Hawaiian\ncommemoration that Justice Breyer referred to that I\nthink I had to rethink, because it was a public speech\nin a public forum. The librarian researching bargaining\nissues at the union headquarters in downtown Washington\nor -- well, in downtown Washington of the international\naffiliate I think is chargeable under Lehnert.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The librarian in Hawaii\nresearching something that the plaintiff has no interest\nin spending money on, would that be prohibited.\nMR. YOUNG: Well, here, Justice Stevens, we\nare simply talking about of course the international\naffiliate. As far as cross-unit affiliation, I'm not\nsure. I think that would fall under again, general,\nLehnert's general test.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us two\nhypotheticals. One is the librarian, two is the public\ncelebration. Would nonunion, would participating unions\nbe allowed to contribute to either of those activities?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, of course they'd be\nallowed to. Can they force nonmembers --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Against nonmembers?\nAgainst members, there has to be a pro-ration, they has\nto be a pro-ration. A with the librarian, B with the\ncelebration.\nMR. YOUNG: The public celebration, no; the\nlibrarian, I believe so, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You have several times\nmentioned the public forum as having a significance in\ndrawing the line and I'm not sure I follow you there.\nWhy did you say that?\nMR. YOUNG: Well, I think -- well, Justice\nSouter, that arises from the Court's determinations on\nthings like public relations and lobbying and the\ndistinction it makes, the distinction for instance in\nLehnert between the teacher's voice articles and the\nreserve public education program. The distinction drawn\nfrom that, the different, differing results is that\nwhere internal union communications regarding\nnonpolitical matters were treated as chargeable by a\nmajority of this Court and where the, outward looking\nspeech activities is treated as not chargeable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this. If an\nemployer and a union local decided that you know they\nwould really let the sunshine in and they would conduct\ntheir collective bargaining in a theater with\nmicrophones and anybody could drop in and hear, would\nthat change the chargibility of, as against the\ndissenting nonmembers.\nMR. YOUNG: No Justice Souter because the\nspeech would still be directed at the public employer\nnot ex--- I would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\nMr. Collins?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen this Court in Abood described the kinds\nof expenditures that bargaining agents are are required\nto engage in and that necessitate a rule that requires\nall represented employees including objecting nonmembers\nto pay their share services of lawyers is what the court\nfirst mentioned. The single narrow question presented\nin this case is whether a local bargaining agent that's\nconfronted with the need to pay for those services of\nlawyers to draw upon legal expertise in bargaining\nrelated matters is required to go it alone rely solely\non its open resources and its own expertise or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not what\nwe are talking about. It doesn't have to go it alone.\nIt simply can't force members of another unit that can\ndecide they are happy to support it but the members who\ndon't want to support it who don't like unions, they\ncan't be forced to pay for it if it does not relate to\ntheir collective bargaining agreement.\nMR. COLLINS: But the question Mr. Chief\njust sis whether that, I should add if that unit wants\nto not neither go it alone nor give a free ride to\nobjecting nonmembers can they avail itself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the litigation is\nnot germane to the unit where people object to that\nunit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free\nriding on anything.\nMR. COLLINS: They are free riding on the\nsame thing that Lehnert says they cannot free ride on.\nLehnert as Mr. Young acknowledges certainly holds that\nas a general proposition when a local union bargaining\nagent is determining how to finance germane expenditures\nthat it will incur germane to its unit, it can either\nobviously go it alone rely on its own resources or it\ncan enter into an affiliation relationship where it will\npay an affiliation fee the -- of which will be measured\nby the tote chargeable expenditures incurred by the\nNational Union in other bargaining units as well as when\nit's the local's own unit. What Lehnert teaches is that\nthat situation cannot fairly be described as requiring\nthe objective nonmember to subsidize other units.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there is no\n-- I guess I'm getting into the solace thor general's\nposition here. What if the unit with the objective\nmembers does not have a right to call upon the pool?\nEither, or has never called upon the pool in its\nunlikely that it will. Isn't there, it's not simply\nsubsidization. It's their compelled fees being used for\nsomething that doesn't Ben fate their collective\nbargaining arrangement.\nMR. COLLINS: There are three problems with\nthat contention by the solace the -- general which the\npetitioners have adopted for the first time in their\nreply brief. The first problem was precisely that. It\nwas not raised in the Court of Appeals, it's not raised\nin the petition for certiorari. The second problem is I\nshould add it's not been raised in any other post\nLehnert case and I think the reason this issue is not\nbeing raised is it's understood I think incorrectly that\nLehnert itself did not solve a situation where the kind\nof showing that the solicitor general and now with the\nPetitioners would require. In Lehnert where this court\ndid approve pooling of a wide range of expenses the\ncourt simply referred to the fact that the union in that\ncase had a unified membership structure which as the\ncourt put it under which so many unions operate and the\ncourt talked about the essence of an affiliation\nrelationship between that locals can draw on\ninternational for services but there was no record, this\nwas no showing, this was no finding, there was no\ndiscussion of any notion that that local union in\nLehnert had an enforceable right for any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly -- I'm\nsorry. I was just going to say exactly so I regard that\nissue as still open. It was not addressed at all in\nLehnert.\nMR. COLLINS: It was raised in the reply\nbrief in Lehnert. The Petitioners in Lehnert complained\nthat a problem with pooling is that there are no\nguarantees and no standards. That -- that's why there's\na discussion that's reflected in Justice Scalia's\nseparate opinion, a discussion of the fact that it was\nacknowledged that there is no contractual relationship,\nbut that there were certain customs and -- and\npractices. But there was no evidence and certainly no\ndetermination by this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what did the Court\nmean in Lehnert when it said there must be some\nindication the payment is for service that may\nultimately inure to the benefit of members of the local\nunion by virtue of their membership in the parent\norganization?\nMR. COLLINS: What -- what the Court meant\nby that, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that -- well,\nlook at the examples the Court gave of what does not --\nor the Court referred to certain kinds of payments a\nlocal union could make which are not part of an\naffiliation fee payment.\nThe Court talks about direct payments to\nother locals. The Court -- the other example given was\na payment to a -- a national union that wasn't required\nby affiliation but was like a charitable contribution.\nWhat the Court did not dispute in Lehnert is\nthat, to the extent that an affiliation fee is providing\na pool of resources used by the national union for\notherwise chargeable services, the potential\navailability of those services does satisfy the\ninurement requirement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose, let's say, that one\nor more locals someplace else in the country are\ninvolved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a\nresult, the international assesses all of the locals a\nfee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same\ntime adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in\nthe future that the international will ever subsidize\nany other local union litigation expenses.\nWould the local -- would a -- would a local\nunion not involved in that litigation -- would they --\nwould it be permissible for them to charge their\nnonmembers?\nMR. COLLINS: If it were a special\nassessment for a specific purpose, I think under -- it\nis not embraced by Lehnert's rationale. It might not\nwell not be chargeable, because what Lehnert -- Lehnert\ndoes not arise in a vacuum. Lehnert talks about the\ntypical affiliation fee relationship. And there have\nbeen various submissions, treatise articles about that.\nSo the notion is that a National Union\ncharges an affiliation fee for all of the various\nservices it provides, and local unions can draw upon\nthose resources as needed. If you then talk about a\nspecial assessment --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you concede that,\nthen aren't you conceding there has to be some standard\nby -- under which to assess whether the local union that\nis being required to pay the fee for extra-unit\nlitigation expenses is getting something back in return?\nMR. COLLINS: I think not, Your Honor, for\n-- for two reasons. First, I do think that Lehnert did\napprove --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not necessary for there\nto be any standard under which to assess that they are\ngetting anything back in return? If it's clear they are\nnot getting anything back in return, it's still okay?\nMR. COLLINS: Not beyond -- and again the\nquestion isn't presented, but not beyond what Lehnert\nfound necessary. Lehnert found it important -- and I\nwould say necessary to its decision -- that the union in\nthat case had what Lehnert described as a typical,\nunified, membership-affiliation-fee arrangement; and it\ntalks about a typical affiliation fee where locals pay\nmoney to go to the pools of otherwise chargeable\nexpenditures of the national union.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a\nsituation where there is a provision in the collective\nbargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the\nemployer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the\nlocal up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra --\nextra-unit litigation even though it will never have any\nbenefit for it?\nMR. COLLINS: Just as Lehnert plainly holds\nthat local would have to support the negotiation of that\nprovision in the first place in Nome, Alaska. That's\nthe holding of Lehnert. The question is whether\nlitigation is different, and there is no way that\nlitigation is different in any principled way as relates\nto the ruling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it meant\n-- I didn't think Lehnert held that the unit would have\nto support that type of extra-unit litigation. I mean,\nI --\nMR. COLLINS: Well, I may have misconstrued\nyour -- it was litigation over --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, there is\na provision that is ambiguous, which frequently happens,\nand the union says that requires air conditioning, and\nthe company says no, and there is a big fight about\nthat.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, I think my answer is\nstill correct, Your Honor. Lehnert does not hold --\nwell, it does not provide the answer as to litigation;\nbut Lehnert says if the union in the first instance says\nwe want to go to Nome, Alaska and negotiate something\nabout air conditioning, that that, even though it only\naffects the unit in Nome, Alaska, becomes part of the\npool of chargeable expenditures that all units can be\npart of.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, because\nthat negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska\ncollective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating\nit there for that unit.\nMR. COLLINS: But the litigation is equally\ngermane. Petitioners do not dispute that litigation can\nbe germane and chargeable within a particular unit.\nThey acknowledge that; there is no dispute about that.\nSo both the negotiation of the air conditioning right in\nNome, Alaska and the enforcement of that negotiated\nagreement through litigation are equally germane within\nthe unit; the same interests are involved --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't they, aren't\nthey equal chargeable? Isn't the unspoken premise of\nyour argument and what Lehnert is getting at -- they are\nnot only germane, but isn't there an unspoken premise\nthat just as the union will support -- the union of the\ndissident objectors in negotiating a collective\nbargaining agreement, the union will also presumably\nsupport them if litigation is necessary later on to\nenforce it?\nSo that the so-called standard by which the\nunion's obligation to support the litigation and the\nunit that includes the dissidents is not somehow\nprecisely spelled out. The assumption is that they do\nhave some obligation to support the litigation if it\ncomes to the dissidents' unit. And isn't that -- isn't\nthat the point of your argument?\nMR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand I want to make clear when the Court spoke in Lehnert\nof the essence of an affiliation agreement, an\naffiliation agreement is a contractual relationship. We\nwould certainly view that as creating a covenant of good\nfaith and fair dealing that the national union will deal\nfairly with its various units.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which is a covenant, in\neffect, of support.\nMR. COLLINS: That's correct, and it's\nactually quite analogous in that regard to the duty of\nfair representation that, let's say an unaffiliated\nlocal union owns to its objecting nonmembers. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think as a\ncovenant of support you have -- however many -- about a\nthousand individual units. You think each of those, you\nhave a covenant to support them when they all get -- get\ninvolved in separate litigation? You can't possibly.\nMR. COLLINS: No, Mr. Chief Justice, what I\nsaid was a covenant of good faith and fair dealing. And\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's quite\nunlike, for example, insurance. If you have insurance\nand you as the unit have a particular obligation, you\nhave a right to have that covered. There is no similar\nright here.\nMR. COLLINS: That's -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. The First Amendment does not create a rate\nsetting rule for unions. And the reason for that is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so there is no, there\nis no covenant of support. There is what? A covenant\nof support if the litigation in the local unit that\nincludes the dissidents has wide significance, and\ntherefore could affect other units? Is that what the --\nis that what the obligation is?\nMR. COLLINS: No, Justice Souter. I would\nnot --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is this any obligation at\nall? You said okay, there is an obligation of some kind\nof fair dealing. Given the question that we've got,\nthat doesn't matter unless the fair dealing relates at\nsome point to support for litigation, right?\nMR. COLLINS: That the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right?\nMR. COLLINS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. COLLINS: That the National Union --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And how do we articulate\nwhat that obligation is? If it's not covenant to\nsupport regardless of what the litigation is, how do we\narticulate what the degree of the obligation of support\nis?\nMR. COLLINS: The way I would articulated\nit, and then I would like to take a step backward and\ncompare it to the nonaffiliated situation. I would\narticulate it as follows, that there is no any First\nAmendment requirement, that there is in reality in the\naffiliation agreement simply a covenant of good faith\nand good dealing that one local will be treated with\nrespect to litigation needs as others would be treated.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the trouble with\nsaying that is exactly the point that the Chief Justice\nraised. You don't take the position that no matter what\nthe litigation is, the parent union has got to support\nit. Therefore, how do we identify the litigation that\nthey will support? How do we know that they have any\nobligation at all?\nMR. COLLINS: They -- they don't have a\nFirst Amendment obligation, but, Your Honor, that is\ntrue in the case of agency fees all together. We have\nto take a step back and remember that we are trying to\nperform an exercise the court has said can't be done to\nperfection of trying to distinguish between making\nindividuals who object support collective bargaining\nactivities not support other things.\nIn Hudson itself, in the basic situation --\nlet's assume there is no affiliation agreement, simply a\nlocal union, a fee is charged based on the percentage of\nexpenses in the prior year that went for chargeable\nactivities, including, let's say, litigation. That\ncreates no guarantee that when the year -- in the year\nthat we are now in, when fees are being paid, that if\nlitigation is demanded, requested by a nonmember or\nanyone else, that that local union will provide --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't create a\nguarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance\npolicy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which\none can refer. And it seems, it would seem reasonable\nin a case like that to say, okay, you can force the\ndissident to pay a fair share on the expectation that\nthe same kind of enforcement litigation will take place\nif there is a dispute this year or next year.\nWe don't have, as I understand it, a clear\nsort of expectation standard when we are talking about\naffiliation agreements that involve a parent and many,\nmany other locals. And the point here, it seems to me,\nis to determine whether there is any obligation at all\nwhether the dissident is getting anything or can expect\nto get anything for the fee. And what I want to know is\nhow do we describe that obligation?\nMR. COLLINS: I think, at most, the\nobligation is parallel to the duty of fair\nrepresentation in the sense that the entity that's\nresponsible for determining what services are going to\nbe provided to the employees has to treat, in the case\nof the local union members and nonmembers in the unity\nplea, in the case of the national union it's a different\naffiliated entity fairly -- the reason --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we are talking\nabout an infringement on the objecting members' first\namendment rights, and your answer is trust us, we'll\ntreat you fairly? I understand that it's a different\nanswer if you say you've got a right. We can impose the\ncontribution requirement on you, even though you object\nto it because under this agreement, you have a right to\ncall upon our services. That's a different case. But\nif your answer is simply trust us we'll treat you\nfairly, that's not the usual standard we apply to\ninfringements of First Amendment rights.\nMR. COLLINS: But I have two answers to\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it is essentially the\nanswer that's supplied under Hudson, where the court\nsays simply use the prior year's percentages. We don't\nknow whether this year we'll have the same percentage\nbreakdown. We also don't know whether this year the\nunion will have enough money to provide any particular\nservice or not. But we don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's different.\nThat's a little bit more stringent than saying trust us.\nThat's saying let's look at the last year and we'll\nfigure it out.\nMR. COLLINS: But we look at the -- but --\nbut we look at the national union typical affiliation\ntype arrangement, as the court described it in Lehnert,\nand what we understand is this is a union that's not\nmaking a profit, it's not piling up fees and putting\nthem somewhere. It exists to provide services to local\naffiliates.\nThose affiliates, if they are not provided\nwith services, it's not just the nonmember, the objector\nwho's being harmed, the members want those services by\ndefinition.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't it be,\ncouldn't the national say, local, you have asked for\nassistance with such-and-such litigation. We think your\ncase is what this Court sometimes calls a bad vehicle.\nWe don't want to finance your litigation, the issue is\nimportant and we are going to wait for a case that\npresents it in a better light, is more likely to win.\nMR. COLLINS: Absolutely, Your Honor, that's\none thing a national union can properly do. Another\nthing a national union can properly do is to say we've\njust had an unexpected economic crisis, all of a sudden\nmidterm we have to change our priorities and we are\ngoing to have to protect people from a lot of layoffs.\nBut the second point I want to make --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The issue is not whether\nthat's a fair thing for the national union to do. The\nissue is whether the person who is being compelled\nagainst his will to pay dues to the union is getting\nanything back for that compelled payment. And even\nthough the national union may be acting in an entirely\nfair fashion, given its national objectives, the -- the\ncompelled payment is not doing what our cases seem to\nsay it must do. It has to be paying for services\nrendered.\nMR. COLLINS: What -- the value the -- the\nobjector is getting is not have a guarantee of services.\nHe has the potential for services far beyond what could\never be paid for out of the local's own affiliation\nfees.\nAnd I would add if a national union were to\nact in some improper way in terms of how it doles out\nassistance -- and by the way, one doesn't see cases on\nthis, it's really not in the nature of how national\nunions operate, because again, we are talking about\nmembers and nonmembers equally in terms of who's going\nto get benefits. So it's not a problem in the real\nworld of national unions treating a particular local\nunfairly for some reason and not giving them services\nthat are given to others. There are certainly a lot of\njudgments involved, as Justice Ginsburg's question\nelicited.\nBut if a national union were to treat\naffiliates unfairly, it's quite possible that if and\nwhen that occurred, that it might have implications\nunder a number of possible causes of actions and\nincluding possibly the right to object. Justice\nScalia's opinion in Lehnert noted that if and when\nservices aren't provided, there might be ground for\nobjection.\nThe question here is is this a basis under\nthe First Amendment to have a prophylactic rule that\nsays we are so concerned that even though we have no\nrule under Hudson that provides assurance that an\nunaffiliated local union will provide any particular\nservices to its members and nonmembers, we have such a\nconcern that somehow national unions won't deliver the\ngoods, that we are going to set up the hierarchy of\neither guarantees, standards, which if the issue had\nbeen presented here and we had created a record, we\nwould show the Court -- I think no union in this country\nhas and for good reason, both because of the virtual\ninfinitude of legitimate factors one could consider also\nbecause of the constant changes in needs of local\nunions --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If certain -- if certain\nfees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a\npooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're\nresisting any effort to impose any standards or any\ninquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement?\nMR. COLLINS: Because, Your Honor -- and the\nreason I started my argument by saying there is really\ntwo choices, a local union goes it alone or has the\narrangement that we have here, is that it simply would\nnot be possible in the nature of things to have a set of\nstandards and guarantees that would be meaningful in any\nway to govern how national unions provide services to\nlocals. A standard of basic fairness and equal\ntreatment is one thing, but to try to say -- and one\ncould tick off, I suppose, 50 things we'll consider.\nWe'll consider whether it's going to be an\nimportant precedent, whether it's the kind of thing a\nlocal can't afford on its own, whether it's important\nnow that we have pressing economic problems and everyone\nis being laid off, is this a good test case or a bad\ntest case, how broad will the implications of this be.\nOne could list 50 factors, but they wouldn't guide any\ninquiry in a meaningful way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we determine\nas a matter of First Amendment law that such a\nrequirement is necessary, then you lose, because you're\nsaying we can't possibly fashion the test?\nMR. COLLINS: Then we lose and so does the\nunion in Lehnert lose. There was no -- it was\nacknowledged that there was nothing like that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Lehnert didn't\naddress the question of litigation.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, but if -- but there has\nbeen no argument made that would explain why if you --\nif one can pool -- if the union negotiates an agreement\nwith a very controversial provision that a nonmember has\na very legitimate objection to, Lehnert holds that can\nbe pooled. Lehnert does not say the standard --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your argument seems to be\nthat the whole analogy of a pooling arrangement is\ninvalid. That was unrealistic, because there really is\nno way of telling whether any of these things is a\npooling arrangement. There is no standard that could\npossibly be articulated that would be meaningful to\ndetermine whether something that is labelled a pooling\narrangement really is in any way a pooling arrangement.\nThat seems to me argument. That would seem to cut\nagainst the whole idea of pooling arrangements not only\nfor litigation expenses, but for everything else.\nMR. COLLINS: I have two responses to that,\nJustice Alito. First, the -- if one had to have the\nkinds of either guarantees or meaningful enforceable\nstandards that are implied in your question, then in the\nnature of the beast, it could not be done by national\nunions, and we would be in a system then when all that\ncan happen is that a local union has to rely solely on\nits own resources, solely on its own expertise. And\nit's doing that despite, as Judge Lynch pointed out in\nthe concurrence, despite the dire impact that can have\non its ability to represent people and it's doing it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't have to do\nthat. It can use the money of its union members any way\nit wants. It can contribute to the national all of\ntheir money if it wishes. We are only talking about\nthat portion of the union income which comes from people\nwho don't want to join the union.\nMR. COLLINS: Well, then it either has to\nallow for -- the union has to either conclude we are\ngoing to support all of our germane activities, all of\nour chargeable activities through our own funding and\nour own resources, and if that's just inadequate and\ntherefore litigation needs to be conducted, we can't do\nit; the employer knows that so it can take advantage of\nus in bargaining; we are just going to have to live with\nit; or we can say our members will pay for that but the\nnonmembers won't, because the only solution other than\nusing the local's own money is to pay a fee to the\nnational. And as I've indicated in Lehnert as in this\ncase, the arrangement is not one that provides\nguarantees --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, one of the\ndifficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position\nwith the sort of all or nothing approach. But you\nseemed to be taking the mirror position of that. Your\nargument is all or nothing on your side. I don't get\nmuch help from either side as to what the standard\nshould be. I know germane is obviously a malleable\nword, but we are looking to see if there is some test\nthat we can use that's not all or nothing.\nMR. COLLINS: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I haven't heard from\neither side yet what that would be.\nMR. COLLINS: The -- the question, Justice\nKennedy, is whatever the test is if it's satisfied as to\nexpenditures within the unit where the services are\nprovided, can those services be pooled or is there a\ndifferent test that has to be applied to the pooling?\nMy submission is that Lehnert makes clear there is no\nseparate test.\nAs to what the test is within -- and\ntherefore, as to the question presented here, one\ndoesn't need to decide on the actual test that will be\napplied within the local because as your separate\nopinion and Justice Scalia's separate opinion in Lehnert\nmade clear, even under the narrower statutory duties\ntest there could still be pooling; the definition as to\nwhat can be pooled would simply be different. I'd only\nnote on the question of whether the tests should be\ngermaneness with the two additional prongs as held in\nLehnert, or the statutory duties test, that again is a\nquestion that's not presented here. As I just indicated\nit doesn't affect the concept of pooling.\nThere has also been no confusion, contrary\nto Petitioner's contention, under the Lehnert test. The\nonly issue that's given the courts difficulties is the\nspecific issue here as to why the plurality in Lehnert\nseemed to indicate that litigation might be in a\ndifferent status under pooling. So there is no basis in\nthis case for reconsidering the basic Lehnert test of\nchargeability.\nI will simply note, however, that the\nstatutory duties test which -- for which Petitioners\nargue really doesn't make the situation clearer than\nthe -- than the germaneness test because the\nGovernment -- both the germaneness test and the\nstatutory duties test acknowledge that the union's right\nto charge objecting nonmember stems from its function as\nexclusive bargaining representative; but there is no way\nto sustain logically the notion that that means that\nonly those things that are done in that exclusive\nrepresentative capacity are chargeable; because the same\nGovernment interests that allow for charging when the\nunion is acting as the exclusive bargaining agent have\nto also allow for charging for those things that are\nnecessary in order for the union to play that role, and\nto enforce that role which includes things like the\nheadquarters; it includes things like litigation to\nenforce an agreement, even though in those areas when\nperforming those functions, the union very often does\nnot have an exclusive representational duty or duty of\nfair representation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a rule or a reg\nsomewhere in the Labor Department that says if the\nnational union takes its money from its local, spends it\nin a way that has nothing to do with politics\nwhatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build\ntoo big a building, or they do something that doesn't\nbenefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?\nMR. COLLINS: There is no Labor Department\nregulation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no remedy at all.\nMR. COLLINS: No, and I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So union members who are\nbeing gypped, they just have to put up with it.\nMR. COLLINS: I would say there would be a\nbreach of covenant of faith and fair dealing under the\naffiliation relationship in some of those situations;\nand of course if a union used an illegal basis for\ndetermining whether it would provide services to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Are you saying you\ncould bring a lawsuit or not?\nMR. COLLINS: You could bring a lawsuit\nalleging that the union violated its covenant of good\nfaith and fair dealing to its affiliates, if the union\nacted on the basis of say, race, for example, you could\ncertainly bring a lawsuit then.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So either -- in these cases\neverybody in the union whether they're forced or not,\nhas this kind of remedy or nobody does? That's your --\nMR. COLLINS: Right. And the reason for\nthat is -- what we always have to understand here, is\nthe interest in seeing to it that a local union that\npays an affiliation fee will receive services in a fair\nway from the national is an interest that's shared\nequally by the members and the nonmembers. It's not\nsomething that creates a First Amendment concern.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\nright. Again we have to postulate that we are dealing\nwith members who don't like unions at all. So while the\nmembers may think this is perfectly fair, the nonmembers\nwhenever their money is forced to be used for union\nactivities, it's unfair.\nMR. COLLINS: But a -- a member equally with\na nonmember would, Mr. Chief Justice, have the view that\nif it's predictable year after year that for some reason\nhis local doesn't get services from the national union,\nthe national union sends it elsewhere, that member is\ngoing to be no more happier -- happy than the nonmember.\nThat's why those things don't happen in the real world.\nThat's why we certainly don't need a prophylactic rule\nand there would certainly be no First Amendment basis\nfor a prophylactic rule that requires the union to\nestablish what no union in this country to my knowledge\nhas, which is either a clear guarantee or specific\nstandards for providing services.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Collins.\nMr. Young, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. YOUNG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nthink it's appropriate to note the apocalyptic\npredictions that are suggested from the rule that the\nPetitioners are advancing are avoidable by easily --\nreadily available alternatives. International unions\nwould of course be free to make loans to local\naffiliates engaged in massive litigation or other speech\nactivities where they think it's appropriate.\nBut the alternative is not between\nprohibiting pooling arrangements which have no\nstandards, no enforceability and no predictability, and\nallowing the nonmembers to become free riders on\nlegitimate litigation expenditures funded through the\ninternational affiliate. The choice is between a\nmalleable -- a malleable unpredictable and ultimately\nunenforceable agreement and a standard which would allow\nthe international to subsidize such litigation and allow\nthe true -- only the costs of that litigation to be\nextracted from nonmembers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the case -- the case\nthat says that a union member, person forced into the\nunion agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay\nto be an integrated bar and I guess a doctor who has to\njoin a medical association -- the case that says that\nthese people have a First Amendment right to get back\nmoney that's being wasted, is what?\nMR. YOUNG: We don't suggest that there is\nsuch a right, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So unless it's political in\nyour view, you don't have that right?\nMR. YOUNG: Unfortunately no, Justice\nBreyer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The test is not\nwhether it's political, is it? It's not a negative\ntest. It's an affirmative requirement in which the\nburden is on the union that they have to show the\nexpenditure is germane to the particular collective\nbargaining agreement?\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's\nexactly correct, and -- and the test in determining\nwhether or not it is a -- can be charged across\nbargaining unit lines is a bright-line test of whether\nit is a speech activity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, do you have a\nresponse to Justice Kennedy's concern? Do you have a\nfallback position or are you also in the all or\nnothing --\nMR. YOUNG: I'm afraid you've got two\nprincipled advocates before you Mr. Chief Justice who\nare holding firm to their positions. I would however\nlike to address one more point. I think it's\nappropriate to recall, get us back again to the focus on\nthis is compelled speech subject to the Court's strict\nscrutiny jurisprudence. The test suggested by MSEA is\nthat a union's activities are subject to a, subject to\nthe duty of fair representation and to the covenant of\ngood faith and fair dealing under the duty of fair\nand/or under the duty of fair represent which of course\nis that wide range of reasonableness cannot be sustained\nwhere this court's standard is the least restrictive\nmeans.
