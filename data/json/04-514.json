        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Ricky Bell v. Gregory Thompson.\nMs. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhen the Sixth Circuit withdrew its judgment\naffirming the denial of habeas corpus relief 6 months\nafter this Court denied certiorari review, it exceeded its\nauthority to act under both the rules of appellate\nprocedure and this Court's decision in Calderon v.\nThompson.\nAs to the rules, rule 41(d)(2)(D) requires,\nwithout exception, that the court issue a mandate\nimmediately upon the filing of an order of this Court\ndenying certiorari. That did not happen in this case.\nBut because the court had no discretion under the rule to\ndo anything other than to issue that mandate, its\nsubsequent action withdrawing its judgment was tantamount\nto a recall of the mandate, which, under this Court's\nprecedent in Calderon, cannot be justified in this case\nbecause the evidence simply does not support a miscarriage\nof justice, which under Calderon means actual innocence of\nthe offense or actual innocence of the death penalty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're -- if you're going to\n-- if you're going to consider something that wasn't a\nrecall of a mandate as if it was, why don't you consider\nit as a rule 41(b) action?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, we don't read rule 41(b)\nas allowing any sort of recall authority. Rule 41\nJUSTICE BREYER: They didn't recall it, didn't\n-- did they? Did they recall it? They issued it and then\nrecalled it?\nMS. SMITH: The mandate was not recalled --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine.\nMS. SMITH: -- because it was never issued.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. So we did -- they\ndidn't recall it. So, of course, 41(b) does not have to\ndo with recalls. 41(b) has to do with issuances, and\n41(b) says the court may shorten or extend the time for\nissuing. Now, why wouldn't that be the obvious rule to\napply to what occurred here?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, that is not -- not the\nrule applicable here because that rule applies in a\ndifferent context. That applies at an earlier stage of\nthe post-judgment proceeding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where does it say earlier?\nMS. SMITH: Rule 41(b) specifically deals with\nthe 7-day period of -- of time for issuance following the\nexpiration of the time for a petition for rehearing or the\ndisposition of that petition for rehearing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the court can -- can extend\nit or -- or in fact truncate it, can't it?\nMS. SMITH: It can, Your Honor, at that point.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what if the court then\n-- I'm -- let me just get to -- and I think this is\nconsistent with Justice Breyer's question. What if the\ncourt, at the -- at the point cert was denied and\nrehearing was denied, simply said, I -- we're now\noperating under (b) and we're extending the time?\nMS. SMITH: Because the more specific provision\n-- what the court had actually done was to stay the\nmandate pending a petition for writ of certiorari. The --\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh. That's -- that's what it\ndid, but what if the court had -- had been more articulate\nabout what -- what it -- it was doing or may have been\ndoing and -- and simply said -- at the moment at which the\n-- the rehearing period expired for cert, said, all right,\nwe're still not issuing the mandate and we're operating\nunder subsection (b), we're extending the time. Would --\nis -- is there anything in the rule that, at least in\nterms, would have precluded the court from doing that if\nit had said that?\nMS. SMITH: I think that simply a plain reading\nof the rule and looking at the rule as a whole would\npreclude that result. And the reason is that the -- the\nspecific language that -- that Your Honor is referring to\nspeaks in terms of shortening or extending the time, the\ntime being the 7-day period for issuance. That 7-day\nperiod is simply a period to allow the clerk a window of\ntime to get the mandate out after the rehearing period has\nexpired or after the rehearing has been disposed of. But\nit does not give the court carte blanche to simply\nwithhold the mandate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there are -- are they\nany --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you would make the\nsame argument to that that -- that you were making\nearlier, I assume, that to read it that way would -- would\nbe to nullify Calderon.\nMS. SMITH: That -- that's exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are there any\ncircumstances in which the court can -- and let's again,\nas Justice Souter said, say that it put it on the record\nwhat it was going to do, that we hereby, after the Supreme\nCourt has ruled in the case, will withhold -- order that\nthe mandate shall be withheld for a period of 30 days\nbecause there is a -- a new case coming out on a different\nissue that may affect our -- our holdings?\nMS. SMITH: The court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or that a new case has been --\nhas been released and we think that bears on -- on the\noutcome.\nMS. SMITH: After the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we want to consider that.\nMS. SMITH: After the denial of cert, Your\nHonor?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, or after disposition by\nthis Court on it --\nMS. SMITH: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when cert is granted.\nMS. SMITH: The rule does not allow for that\nwithholding of the mandate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No -- so no circumstances can\nthe issuance of the mandate be extended after this Court\nhas denied the petition for writ of certiorari?\nMS. SMITH: If the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under no circumstances?\nMS. SMITH: If the mandate has been stayed\npending the petition for writ of certiorari and that\npetition has been denied, the rule requires the immediate\nissuance. Now, there -- there may be and -- and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you accepted the\npetition for rehearing in this Court would also count,\nalthough the rule doesn't say that.\nMS. SMITH: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The rule speaks about the\nmandate should issue when cert is denied, but in this\ncase, there was a further extension while this Court was\nconsidering a petition for rehearing. Do you say that\nthat was also outside the rules so that the mandate would\nhave to issue when cert is denied even if there is a\npetition for rehearing and a request to continue the stay\nduring the pendency of that rehearing petition?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. The mandate should\nhave issued --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say that that was\nwrong in this case too.\nMS. SMITH: That was in excess of the court's\nauthority under the rules.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so your view --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to get -- if I may\njust get -- you say there are no circumstances in which --\nwhere (d) is otherwise applicable, the mandate can -- can\nbe -- the issuance of the mandate can be extended.\nMS. SMITH: In our view the rule does not allow\nany other circumstances. Rule 41 does not allow any other\ncircumstances. If that authority --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the prosecutor -- did the\nprosecutor object when there was a further extension given\nfor the pendency of the petition for rehearing?\nMS. SMITH: The State did not object to the --\nto the extension, Your Honor, because the -- the mandate\nwas of no consequence to the State in terms of the State's\nactual -- a State court proceedings. The State did not\nneed the mandate to go forward with its proceedings, and\nin fact, the State was not authorized under State law to\neven seek an -- an execution date until the time had\nexpired for rehearing. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not\nclear about the facts here. Did -- did the court -- did\nthe court comply with (b)? Did it shorten or extend the\ntime? Was there any issuance of a -- of a -- of an order\nshortening or extending the time, or did the court just\nignore the deadline and -- and act later?\nMS. SMITH: The court simply ignored the -- the\n-- the process of -- of the case -- the extension ability\nin subsection (b) was never invoked by the court. There\nwas a timely petition for rehearing filed, which\nautomatically stayed the mandate under subsection (d)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there -- there is nothing\nfrom the court that -- that says we -- we shorten or\nextend the time.\nMS. SMITH: That's absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. The court never invoked subsection (b) as\nauthority for exaction. After -- when the petition for --\nfor rehearing was denied, the 7-day period in subsection\n(b) then came into play. The petitioner, or the -- the\npetitioner below, Mr. Thompson, filed a motion to withhold\nthe matter, stay the mandate pending a petition for writ\nof certiorari, and that was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then I guess that the -- that\nthe conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the\ncourt has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must\nissue 7 calendar days after.\nMS. SMITH: That is our reading of the rule,\nyes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But isn't that the reading of\ncircuit?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that reading of the rule\nrequire that a decision to extend the time be set forth in\nany particular form of order or any written document?\nMS. SMITH: It's our -- it's our reading of the\nrule that -- that the language employed in subsection (b)\nimplies some affirmative action of -- of the court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe they internally\ndid affirmatively decide to extend the time, but they just\ndidn't enter an order. Would that count?\nMS. SMITH: I don't think so, Your Honor. A\ncourt in -- in our view --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if they called counsel\nand said, we've decided to delay extending the time?\nWould that -- but we're -- we're going to extend the time,\nbut we're not going to bother to enter an order. Would\nthat constitute an extension?\nMS. SMITH: I don't think that would constitute\nan extension. I think the language in subsection (b)\nrequires some --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It requires a written\ndocument --\nMS. SMITH: -- some affirmative order --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- saying for how long it's\ngoing to be extended?\nMS. SMITH: Some affirmative order of the court\nnot only saying we're going to extend the -- the time, but\nto give an alternative time. That -- subsection (b) does\nnot allow for -- for an indefinite withholding of a\nmandate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they apparently did\ndecide to extend the time for whatever time it took them\nnecessary to review the files that this particular judge\nbecame aware of during this period. They did, in fact,\nextend the time because they didn't issue it.\nMS. SMITH: All this record shows, Your Honor,\nis that the mandate did not issue. So the reason for that\nis -- is not clear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did the court give any\nexplanatory reason for what it did?\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. There is no order\nin this record explaining why the mandate did not issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the opinion of Judge\nSuhrheinrich -- I forget his name -- explains in great\ndetail why he thought they needed more time before the\nmandate issued. I don't know why that isn't explaining\nwhy he extended the mandate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But a single judge\ndoesn't have the authority, does he?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I believe that a single\njudge would have the authority to extend the mandate, but\na single judge would not have the authority to grant\nrehearing because that would be a determination of -- of\nthe case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Smith, this -- unlike the\nCalderon, which is a -- was a -- a court has authority to\nrecall a mandate that has already issued, this seemed to\nbe a really idiosyncratic case. I mean, this was an\nextraordinary situation where a judge said, my goodness, I\nwrote an opinion that assumed this person was mentally\nokay, and now I discovered in the file things I never saw\nbefore. This is a death case. I have reason to suspect\nthat this person may not have been competent when he\ncommitted the crime, may not have been competent when he\n-- when he stood trial, may not be competent at this very\nmoment.\nA judge in that situation -- he finds something\nthat looks like it's the -- it's -- it's the key piece of\nevidence in favor of the defendant. Somehow it never got\nsubmitted. A judge, knowing that he has written an\nopinion saying this man, as far as the Federal courts are\nconcerned, goes to the State and they can set their date\nof execution and all that -- that was an -- this case is\nso idiosyncratic that I'm concerned about dealing with\n41(b) and mandates for this really unusual situation.\nMS. SMITH: It is an unusual situation, Your\nHonor, but the court did more than simply write an\nopinion. The court entered a judgment on that opinion,\nand that judgment became final and became the final word\nof the court upon entry --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He couldn't have recalled the\nopinion because of the extraordinary circumstance. My\nGod, I made a mistake. He couldn't recall the opinion,\ncould he?\nMS. SMITH: The court always have the -- the\nsafety valve of -- of its recall power under extraordinary\ncircumstances. Now, in a habeas case, that extraordinary\ncircumstance has to be more than just this -- for some\nreason, I overlooked this.\nAnd -- and bear in mind as well that this\nevidence was in front of the court. Judge Suhrheinrich\nhad this deposition for 21 months before that first\nopinion was entered and that first judgment was entered.\nSo this was not something --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this.\nYour -- I think you say that you -- you cannot extend the\nperiod for issuance of a mandate after the Supreme Court\nhas denied the petition. Could the court then issue the\nmandate and then recall it under Calderon?\nMS. SMITH: That's precisely what the court\nshould have done in this case, Your Honor, in -- in our\nview. The mandate was required to issue and then the\ncourt should have looked at this extraordinary\ncircumstance, this -- this unusual circumstance, and made\nthe determination under Calderon whether that met the\nstandard for a miscarriage of justice under the habeas\ndecisions of this Court, specifically Calderon.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you surveyed the circuits?\nI know this -- what -- what you describe as the practice\ncertainly wouldn't have been in the First Circuit. Maybe\nin the D.C. it was, but I mean, we would have thought that\nwe have the power over our own mandate. And of course, if\nit hasn't issued and some extraordinary thing comes along\nrequiring a revision, we would have revised it.\nSo when you read the rules and you say that's\nwhat we argue, you're not arguing it about any court that\nI'm familiar with as an appeals court. So -- so have you\nlooked up the appeals courts and found that in fact there\nis at least one court or two or maybe more that follow the\ninterpretation that you're arguing for?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, we have not done that\ntype of -- of inventory.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you have not, then my\nexperience would be you're arguing for a rule that no\nappeals court follows, that -- that all think they have\npower over the mandate, and that the question becomes one\nof whether or not there was a good reason for delaying the\nmandate.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If there was a good reason,\nthey could, and if there wasn't, maybe they couldn't.\nBut Justice Ginsburg has set forth what sounds\nto me like an excellent reason, that the judge discovered\nhe had made an error that could mean life or death or jail\nor innocence, and before that opinion issues, I want to be\nsure it's correct.\nNow -- now, that's how I'm thinking, that the\ngeneral practice is contrary to what you say, that the\nquestion is a good reason, and that here there could\nhardly be a better one. So what is your response?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, our response to that is\n-- is twofold. Number one, I don't think that -- that the\nRules of -- of Appellate Procedure can be abrogated by the\nconsensus of the circuits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And all the circuits have just\nbeen wrong in their interpretation.\nMS. SMITH: If the circuits are not complying\nwith the plain language of the rule, then -- then, yes,\nthey have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't know that all the\ncircuits have that interpretation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't either.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has Justice Breyer conducted\nthe kind of investigation he asked you about?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, how many cases\nvery similar to that -- this exists? It struck me as just\nprocedurally bizarre.\nMS. SMITH: This is an unusual case in the way\nthat it's set out in Judge Suhrheinrich's opinion, Your\nHonor. But if you look at it and -- and look at it in the\nway that -- that it should have played out -- and the way\nit should have played out was that the mandate should have\nissued after this Court denied cert. This Court then went\non after that to deny rehearing and the State moved\nforward. If at that point Judge Suhrheinrich looked at\nthis deposition and believed that it established or showed\nan extraordinary circumstance, than a recall would --\nwould have occurred, and then that would have been an\nissue.\nBut if you look at the evidence itself, it\nsimply does not rise to the level of -- of extraordinary\ncircumstances. It does not show actual innocence of the\noffense. Gregory Thompson has all along admitted that he\ncommitted this offense. There was no defense of it at\ntrial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- let's take the\nhypothetical where there is an extraordinary -- where it\n-- it does rise to the very high level. And then you have\nthese facts. They just don't say anything and -- and they\nkeep the case. If they could have issued the mandate and\nthen recalled it, what difference does it really make,\nassuming there is an extraordinary circumstance? I know\nyou deny that.\nMS. SMITH: Assuming there is an extraordinary\ncircumstance, I think to prevent the result of having to\nissue and then immediately recall, I think the court in\nthat circumstance, assuming there was actually an\nextraordinary circumstance, actual innocence of the\noffense or actual innocence of the death penalty, which we\ndon't think was shown in this case -- what the court could\ndo in our view is to invoke its authority under rule 2 to\nsuspend the rules for good cause. And in that\ncircumstance, given the finality of the judgment, the good\ncause must rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice\nunder Calderon.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wouldn't have to\nsuspend the rules for good cause since it has authority to\nextend the time for issuing the mandate. It can comply\nwith 41(b). So I think the most you can say is that the\ncourt, when it's faced with extraordinary circumstances of\n-- of the sort that could overcome Calderon, should issue\nand order extending the mandate because, and explaining\nwhy, because there's this evidence which, if true, would,\nyou know, produce a miscarriage of justice in this case.\nMS. SMITH: I think that's one interpretation of\nthe rule, Your Honor. We read that -- the rule a little\nbit stricter than that, and we limit that extension in our\nreading to the 7-day period after the expiration of the\ntime to seek rehearing or the denial. But I think that\nthat is a -- that is a reading --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me again. How do you --\nyou read the rule to say?\nMS. SMITH: We read the rule (b), the extension\nperiod --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. SMITH: -- to be limited to the 7-day period\nafter the expiration of the time to seek rehearing or the\ndisposition of the petition for rehearing en banc or by\npanel or the disposition of a motion to stay the mandate.\nWe limit that to -- that interpretation to a different\nphase of the proceeding.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it doesn't expressly\nsay that in that last sentence.\nMS. SMITH: It -- it doesn't, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address the\nseriousness with which this evidence should be viewed?\nBecause it is disturbing. It certainly would go to\nwhether a death penalty should be given.\nMS. SMITH: I would like to address that, Your\nHonor, because I think that -- that the seriousness of\nthis evidence has been vastly overstated in the concurring\nopinion of the Sixth Circuit.\nThe evidence itself was -- was quite simply a\ndeposition of a clinical psychologist who opined based on\nher -- some additional -- some additional meetings with\nfamily members and a review of the transcripts and other\nevidence that the petitioner suffered from a mental\nillness at the time of the offense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Didn't she interview the --\nthe petitioner herself? Did she not interview the -- the\ndefendant himself?\nMS. SMITH: She did.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. SMITH: She conducted some -- some --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At two different points in\ntime, wasn't it?\nMS. SMITH: Yes, she did, Your Honor, but her\nultimate opinion was couched in the language of\nTennessee's statutory mitigating circumstance, that --\nthat Mr. Thompson at the time of the offense suffered from\na mental illness or defect that -- that impaired his\nability to -- to conform his conduct to the requirements\nof the law, but that was not sufficient to meet the legal\ndefinition of insanity. That is the -- that is the --\nexactly the language under Tennessee's mitigator that --\nthat Dr. Sultan's opinion was specifically limited to.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you disagree with the\nfactual point that I think one of the opinions made, that\nthis study was not, in fact, known to exist by the members\nof the court of appeals panel who decided the merits of\nthe case before the petition for cert was filed?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, there is a disagreement\nin the opinion itself that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As to how serious it was. I\nunderstand. But do you -- do you disagree with what I\nunderstood to be a representation of Judge Suhrheinrich\nthat he did not know about this study, did not know -- it\nhad not gotten into the record, and neither did anybody\nelse on the panel, even though, it seems to me, sort of\nstrange that nobody did know it? I have to confess that.\nBut do you dispute the factual predicate or the fact that\n-- that they did not know that this study was available?\nMS. SMITH: Judge Suhrheinrich represented that\nhe was unaware of the deposition, and I have no way to\ndispute that except to say -- I have no way to dispute his\nown personal representation. But Judge Moore pointed out\nin the majority opinion that the deposition was, in fact,\nbefore the court and had been presented for -- 21 months\nearlier than the initial opinion was entered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would it have been\npresented? Because it wasn't -- it wasn't even in the\nrecord in the district court. I mean, that was what\nSuhrheinrich was so bewildered about, that here was what\nseemed to be the strongest evidence for the defendant, and\nat the end of the proceeding in the district court, it's\nnot even made formally a part of the record. It was a\ndeposition. Right?\nMS. SMITH: It was a deposition. It was\nattached to a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance\npending the disposition of a rule 60 motion in the\ndistrict court. That's how it came before the -- before\nthe court of appeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't -- it wasn't in\nthe district court record. It wasn't in the record that\nwent from the district court to the court of appeals. It\nwasn't in the record on appeal.\nMS. SMITH: It was -- it was before the court by\nway of that motion. It was not properly in the record.\nBut then again, it was not any more proper to consider\nafter its opinion than it was to consider before it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was -- was it before the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But wasn't the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- court of appeals in the\npetition for rehearing after the court of appeals made its\ndecision?\nMS. SMITH: It was quoted in the petition for\nrehearing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so it was referenced in\nthe petition for rehearing.\nMS. SMITH: It was directly quoted. The\nultimate opinion, with regard to the mitigator, was\ndirectly quoted.\nBut the -- the point that I was making earlier,\nthis deposition in no way renders the -- the defendant\nineligible for the death penalty because it does not\nundermine any of the three aggravating circumstances. It\ndoes not even make a prima facie showing of insanity under\nTennessee law, as I've stated earlier. It simply tracked\nthe mitigating circumstance under the statute, and as this\ncourt held in Sawyer v. Whitley, simply additional\nmitigating circumstances does not rise to the level of\ninnocence of the death penalty. So it neither -- it\ndemonstrates neither innocence of the -- the offense or of\nthe death penalty. And even more so than that, it would\nnot have even defeated --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You -- you think it could not\nhave been considered in mitigation in the decision whether\nto give a death sentence?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I think it would have\nbeen one element of -- that -- that may have been\nconsidered. But in terms of the extraordinary\ncircumstance, innocent of the death penalty or innocence\nof the offense, it would not rise to that level.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Calderon requires not just that\nit might have been additional mitigation, but that the\ndefendant would have been ineligible for the death\npenalty.\nMS. SMITH: That's -- that's exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's how I read the case.\nMS. SMITH: In Sawyer v. Whitley, this Court\nspecifically said that and rejected the -- the contention\nthat additional mitigation -- mitigating evidence would\nrender a defendant ineligible of the death penalty. So\nthis does not satisfy the actual innocence extraordinary\ncircumstances. Nor would it have --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that may be but\nthe -- the fact that this sort of evidence would\nultimately be kept out from the court of appeals and\nultimately from the district court may be a very good\nreason for us not to adopt your analysis that what\nhappened here is the equivalent of a mandate issuing and a\nmandate being recalled. It may be a very good reason to\nprefer a different analysis.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, we -- we -- it would be\nmere speculation to -- for -- for this Court or any court\nto -- to conclude why this evidence was not presented to\nthe district court. There are any number of reasons.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we don't have to conclude\nwhy it was not presented. All we have to be concerned\nwith or what, I think, we have to be concerned with is\nthis. Is this very important evidence? The answer is\nyes. It may not go to eligibility, but it's very\nsignificant.\nNumber two, if we accept your Calderon analysis,\nthis evidence will be kept out forever. If it's that\nimportant, that may be a good reason not to accept your\nCalderon analysis and say if the mandate hasn't issued, it\nhasn't issued.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's my point and\n-- and you may want to respond to that.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, my response to that is\nit is not that important, and when I say that, it is not\nthat important because it would not even have defeated\nsummary judgment. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I presume your -- your\nanswer would also be that if it's a good reason for -- for\nnot issuing the mandate, as you're supposed to, it would\nequivalently be a good reason to recall the mandate. We\n-- we crossed that bridge in Calderon.\nMS. SMITH: That is precisely the argument that\nwe are making, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I take it you also\nrecognize that the bridge that we did not cross in\nCalderon was -- was in answering the question whether --\nin a case in which a court does not issue the mandate, we\nare going to construe the court's authority, its -- its\ndiscretion narrowly or broadly. And that is the issue\nbefore us here, isn't it?\nMS. SMITH: It is, Your Honor. The issue here\nis -- is whether Calderon extends to this situation. We\nthink it does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying is --\nessentially is we should regard this as though what wasn't\ndone had been done because it was supposed to have been\ndone. In other words, you're saying treat this just as if\nthe mandate issued and was being recalled. That's what I\nget to be the gist of your argument.\nMS. SMITH: That is what we're saying, Your\nHonor, because the effect on the State of Tennessee is\nprecisely the same. The finality is the same. The\njudgment was -- was entered and final at the point that\nthe court entered it the first time in January of 2003.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But let me ask you this. Why\nshould not the proper standard of being -- deciding -- the\ncourt of appeals panel has decided a case. They -- they\nlearn something that would have caused them to come to a\ndifferent conclusion had they not -- had they known it in\ntime. Should not that be a sufficient reason to extend\nthe 7-day period?\nMS. SMITH: I do not think that that would be a\nsufficient reason, Your Honor, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMS. SMITH: -- the extension period --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why does it have to be\nmiscarriage of justice? They just say we goofed for an\ninexcusable reason. We now realize there's something very\nimportant we failed to -- failed to find out. We now know\nit, and we would decide the case differently had we known\nit a week ago. Is that not a sufficient reason to say\nlet's postpone the 7 days?\nMS. SMITH: If the court felt -- the 7-day\nperiod is not to allow the court to rehear the case. If\nthe court wishes to invoke --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that.\nMS. SMITH: -- a rehearing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just asking whether if you\nwere on the -- on the court of appeals, wouldn't you think\nthat would be a sufficient reason to say, hey, don't issue\nthe mandate? Hold it for a week so we can look at this.\nYou don't think that would be permissible for an appellate\njudge to do that?\nMS. SMITH: That would not be permissible. That\nis not the purpose of the extension. It is not to allow a\ncourt to continue to mull over a case once a final\njudgment has been entered. The mandate is not the\njudgment. The judgment is the decision of the court, and\nonce the -- the court has affirmed that judgment, the\njudgment dismissing, denying habeas relief, the State's\ninterests become paramount. Particularly at the point\nwhen this Court has denied cert, all avenues of review\nhave been exhausted, the State at that point ought to be\nable to rely on the finality and ought to be able to rely\non a court to comply with the plain language of the rules\nthat governed it.\nIf any -- if any body should be -- should be\nbound by the rules, it should be a court, and they should\nnot be able to be abrogated by some consensus or just the\nfact that courts don't ordinarily follow them or -- or may\nor may not think that -- that it's appropriate under a\nparticular circumstance.\nMr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the remainder\nof my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Ms. Smith.\nMr. Shors.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW SHORS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SHORS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBefore it relinquished jurisdiction over this\ncase, the court of appeals engaged in sua sponte\nreconsideration to correct a clear error in its prior\ndecision which called into question the reliability of Mr.\nThompson's death sentence. That --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: For how long after the\njudgment becomes final can a court engage in sua sponte\nconsideration of whether to grant a rehearing?\nMR. SHORS: Your Honor, if the court is acting\npursuant to 41(b), which we believe can occur without a\nformal stay order, it -- it can do that at any time before\nit issues the mandate. We're unaware of circumstances in\nwhich that's extended for indefinite periods of time, and\nI think this case is a perfect illustration as to why.\nThis is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about -- about\nthe provision not of 41(b) but of 41(d)(2)? There had\nbeen a petition for certiorari here, which was denied.\nMR. SHORS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Correct?\nMR. SHORS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and (d)(2)(D) says the\ncourt of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a\ncopy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for\nwrit of certiorari is filed. That didn't happen.\nMR. SHORS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\n(d)(2)(D) sets forth the endpoint of a stay entered\npending a petition for certiorari in this Court. That is\nnot the only reason a court of appeals may stay or delay\nissuance of its mandate. In fact, if you look at other\nsections of the rule, (d)(1) affirmatively sets forth a\nseparate basis for staying issuance of the mandate if\nthere is a petition for rehearing filed. And the mere\nfact that you could have competing stays in a case we\nthink illustrates the incorrectness of the State's view\nthat (d)(2)(D) eclipses everything else and requires\nissuance of the mandate under all circumstances.\nThe ultimate power at issue in this case is rule\n41(b) which gives the court the power to shorten or extend\nthe time for which to issue its mandate. As we've set\nforth in the brief, there are all kinds of reasons why a\ncourt of appeals may occasionally continue to do that\nbeyond the denial of certiorari review by this Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think it has to issue\nan order? The State here, having received a judgment and\n-- and seemingly a mandate has to issue after the judgment\nunless there's an order extending the time -- went ahead\nwith proceedings to -- to set the execution, to have the\n-- the person examined to be sure that he was competent to\nbe executed, going through many stages, and was it proper\nfor this court without -- without ever issuing an order\nextending the time for the mandate, simply to come back --\nwhat -- 18 months later and say, oh, by the way?\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, it was proper for\nseveral reasons.\nFirst, rule 41(b) does not require a court\norder. Unlike other provisions of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, including rule 40, it simply says,\nmay extend or shorten the time.\nIf you look at the history of the rule, one of\nthe reasons the advisory committee specifically rejected a\nreading of rule 41(c) that would have made the mandate\neffective when it should have issued is that you can never\nknow from looking at the docket alone whether the non-\nissuance of the mandate was because of a clerical error or\nbecause of a judge's intervention in the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're on -- you're on the\ncourt of appeals. They're proceeding for execution. The\nfamilies of the victims know. The -- the accused, the\ncondemned man, is being -- you tell your colleagues, let's\njust say nothing about this. You think that's good\npractice?\nMR. SHORS: I don't think it's necessarily good\npractice, Justice Kennedy, but it is consistent with the\nrule. And their attack on -- on rule 41 in this case is\nan attack on the general authority of courts of appeals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's consistent with the rule\nnot to enter an order that you're extending the time?\nMR. SHORS: Absolutely it is, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause as I noted, the rule doesn't say by order. The\npractice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a very strange reading\nof the rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know any precedent,\nany case, in which rule 41(b) has been invoked after there\nhas been a petition for cert and petition for cert has\nbeen denied? In practice, is there any other case in the\nworld like this? I don't know of any.\nMR. SHORS: Your Honor, there are cases we've\ncited and rules where the question comes up, does there\nhave to be a formal order entered. We've cited the Sparks\ncase, the Alphin case, and the First Gibraltar case. And\n-- and there are some cases in which, following the denial\nof certiorari, courts of appeal continue to engage in\nreconsideration of the matter. We think that's what\nhappened in the Fairchild case cited in the -- in the red\nbrief, and to a lesser extent, it's what happened in the\nMuntaqim case coming out of the Second Circuit. And the\nreason is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Were -- were those cases in\nwhich they issued an order saying what they were doing?\nI.e., we extend under (b)?\nMR. SHORS: Justice Souter, in the Sparks case,\nas well as in the Rivera case, no, there was no such\norder. And what the Sparks court said, reading rule (b)\ncorrectly we believe, is there's no provision in rule\n41(b) that requires a formal order. That's what's set\nforth in (d) in response to motions. And the reason is a\ncase is not final until the court of appeals issues its\nmandate. And so the burden is on the litigant --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that really\ntrue? Is -- you have a judgment, and it doesn't have\npreclusive effect from the time it issues? It -- it's\njust sort of suspended there with no effect until the\nmandate issues?\nMR. SHORS: Justice Ginsburg, it has some\neffects, but the -- the critical point for this case is\nthe power to reconsider is not eclipsed until the mandate\nissues. That's what this Court held in Forman v. United\nStates, and we think it's what the advisory committee\nnotes of rule 35 and 40 indicate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Shouldn't the State at\nleast be notified of the pendency of this sort of thing?\nMR. SHORS: Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the State\nwas effectively notified when the mandate did not issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, now, that --\nthat really doesn't add up.\nMR. SHORS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: That might be a\nclerical error all by itself.\nMR. SHORS: It -- it could be a clerical error,\nMr. Chief Justice, and we -- we think that's exactly why\nthe advisory committee note -- notes indicate that an\nattorney who believes that a mandate should have issued\nshould confirm that he or she has secured a final judgment\nbefore assuming that the court of appeals jurisdiction\nover a case is completed. That didn't happen in this\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But there was no doubt\nthat there was a final judgment here in the death\nsentence.\nMR. SHORS: For -- for purposes of appeal, that\n-- that would be true, but in -- in this case, as we think\nthe advisory committee notes made clear, the -- the burden\nis on the party, seeking to secure a final judgment, to\nconfirm that a mandate has issued. In fact, in --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it's so remarkable, isn't\nit, that the court did not notify the State and -- and the\ndefendant about what it was considering? It didn't enable\nthem to address the issues by briefs, memos, or argument.\nI mean, this -- this -- it's just an amazing sequence,\ndon't you think?\nMR. SHORS: Justice O'Connor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And how -- how could they\npossibly do the best job they could on the opinion without\nletting the parties know what they were trying to do and\nto address the issue?\nMR. SHORS: Justice O'Connor, the -- the panel\ndid get the decision right in the second case, and it did\nso in response to a thorough review of the entire record.\nCourts of appeal frequently engage in reconsideration\nwithout requiring additional briefing and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: This was -- this was\nhow long after cert had been denied?\nMR. SHORS: Cert was denied on December 1st and\nthe second opinion was June 23rd. So it was a period of\nabout 6 and a half months. It's less than that if you\nconsider that there was a second petition to stay the\nmandate filed and granted, which didn't expire until\nJanuary 23rd when the court of appeals received word that\nthis Court had also denied a petition for rehearing.\nWe think that in any case the burden is on a\nlitigant seeking to secure a final judgment and to ensure\nthat the court of appeals jurisdiction over a case has\nended.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's why I'm quite\ncurious, but I only have experience in one circuit. And\n-- and I have an impression, but I need to know what is\nthe general practice. I would have thought -- but this is\nhighly impressionistic -- that probably the mandates\ndidn't always issue within 7 days, that it wasn't totally\nuncommon to have them 10 days or 12, and it was fairly\ninformal. Certainly there were no notice, but maybe other\ncircuits do it differently. It's an area that's obscure\nto me, and I'd like to know how do people actually handle\nit. Is it something that is generally within the -- up to\nthe individual court of appeals to provide notice or not\nor whatever as it wishes? Is it that some delays, 6\nmonths, might be really much too late? Is it -- how does\nit work in the circuits?\nMR. SHORS: Justice Breyer, our understanding is\nthat the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, including the\ndecision below, have all come to the conclusion that the\nultimate decision of when to issue the mandate lies within\nthe broad discretion of the court of appeals.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they don't normally give\nnotice or -- or something like that? They say, it will be\nhere in 7 days, but we'll tell you we've delayed it. They\njust do it.\nMR. SHORS: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think they might have handled\nit that way, but I don't know if that's the right way.\nMR. SHORS: That -- that occasionally happens,\nand -- and there are some cases clearly where there is a\nformal stay order in place if the court is acting pursuant\nto (d), which we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they just do it even\nwhen they're delaying it for 18 months in order to\nreconsider the case? I can understand they're just doing\nit when -- you know, for clerical or other reasons, it --\nit comes out in 10 days or even 2 weeks instead of -- if\nthat's what you're talking about, that I can understand.\nBut here we're talking about a decision for a lengthy\ndelay in order that the court may reconsider the case. I\nwould be astonished if it were regular practice for a\ncourt to do something like that without notifying the\nparties.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, it -- we're not --\nit's not regular practice. It does happen, and the reason\nit happens, as we've set forth in the brief, have nothing\nto do with this Court's decision to deny review. There\nare instances, which Justice Kennedy pointed out, in which\nfollowing the denial of certiorari review, a court of\nappeals recognizes the clear error of its prior decision.\nThe question in this case is does it have to send out that\ndecision even though it realizes it's in clear error.\nAnd the other reason it sometimes happens over a\nperiod of time is that reconsideration, much like the\ninitial decision-making process, is a fluid process.\nRules 35 and 40 give the court sua sponte the power to\nengage in reconsideration, and that's exactly the power\nthe court exercised in this case.\nThere are particular reasons in this case, as\nthe panel noted, that there was no unfair surprise to the\nState in this case, Justice O'Connor. First, the State\ntook Dr. Sultan's deposition in July of 1999. The\nbriefing on that subject was -- was a matter of days\nfollowing that deposition, and as the panel correctly\nnoted, there was no unfair surprise to the State. The\ncritical, factual issue in this case was as the result of\negregious attorney malfeasance not included in the\ndistrict court record.\nIn addition, the court of appeals --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, to say there's\nno surprise to the State, that may be the State probably\nknew as much as the defendant about what was in the\nrecord, but certainly it was a surprise to the State to\nknow that the court of appeals, after cert was denied, was\npondering all this for that long a time.\nMR. SHORS: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe\nthat was unfair surprise. The court of appeals called for\nthe record back from the district court after it had\notherwise finished with the case and while cert was\npending. That was reflected in the docket sheet, and\nwe've cited that in the joint appendix at page 8. There\nwas --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So the counsel should\ngo to the -- see the docket sheet regularly to see whether\nthe court of appeals might be doing something?\nMR. SHORS: Mr. Chief Justice, at a minimum, an\nattorney seeking to secure a final judgment should check\nthe docket sheet to ensure that a mandate has issued in\naccordance with when the practitioner believes the mandate\nshould have issued. That's exactly what the advisory\ncommittee --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And you say the State\nshould have known what the court of appeals -- before cert\nwas ever considered because it was on a docket sheet. But\nthe case was over, so far as the parties were concerned,\nin the court of appeals and in the district court.\nMR. SHORS: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe\nso. It's not that one reason. It's a combination of\nreasons. If you consider the fact that the State was\naware it had benefited from a clear factual error with\nthe fact that the docket was returned to the court of\nappeals reflected on the docket sheet, with the fact that\nthe State itself initiated collateral litigation in the\nfall of 2003 to preclude the Federal Public Defenders\nOffice from representing Mr. Thompson in the State court\ncompetency proceedings. And even their brief, the Wolfel\ncase that they cite says that alone might be a reason a\ncourt of appeals might want to hold onto its mandate\nbecause it was an issue that was immediately relevant on\n-- on remand in the State court proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What I don't understand is how\nyour argument fits in with -- with the rule that you can't\nrecall the mandate. I mean, you have the same horrific\nsituation. My God, we made a mistake. And we've held you\ncan't recall the mandate unless these very high standards\nare met. Now, are we going to hang on that technical\ndistinction between not issuing the mandate forever and\never and recalling the mandate?\nThe court -- a court has inherent power to\nrecall a mandate, but we said you will not do it unless\nthese very serious obstacles are -- are eliminated. And\nit seems to me, just as a court does have power to extend\nthe time for issuance of the mandate, it makes sense to\nsay the same thing. You shouldn't do it unless these very\nserious obstacles are eliminated.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, I don't believe it's\na technical difference. This Court has always drawn a\nsharp distinction between a court's ability to grab back a\ncase from another court after that case has passed beyond\nits authority to -- as opposed to reconsidering it before\never relinquishing jurisdiction over a case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but they did grab it back\nfrom us. I mean, if what you say is true, we should deny\ncert in all cases where the mandate hasn't issued or where\nthe only stay for the mandate is pending disposition of --\nof cert. We should -- we should put that in our rules.\nThey did snatch it back from us, didn't they? What if we\nhad granted cert?\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, I don't think that\neven the State's view would affect this Court's doctrine\nabout what happens to the mandate if the Court grants cert\nbecause they're only talking here about cases in which\ncert is denied.\nThe denial of cert is not a final decision on\nthe merits, and there are reasons, as we've cited in the\nbrief, for reconsideration sometimes continued after that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if we had granted cert?\nYou -- you say they then could not -- what -- what would\nhappen then?\nMR. SHORS: I think it would depend on whether\nthe mandate was stayed by the court of appeals. If -- if\n-- I think it's pretty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't stayed. It just\nwasn't issued.\nMR. SHORS: If the mandate hadn't been issued,\nthen I think no matter how the Court decides this case,\nthat depending on the circumstances, the court of appeals\nmight be able to alert this Court to a -- a change in the\nfacts that might lead this Court to dismiss the petition\nas improvidently granted. These are not things that\nhappen all the time. They are things that sometimes\nhappened.\nAnd I did want to get back to the final reason I\nthink that the State was not the victim of unfair surprise\nin this case, and that is there was a Federal court stay\nof execution in this case. The State was perfectly well\naware of the importance of securing a final judgment in\nthe court of appeals before returning to State court. And\nas this Court held in Calderon, this Court rejected the\nState's view that a Federal habeas appeal is final when\ncert is denied. That was the view of the State of\nCalifornia in that case.\nThis Court instead specifically tied the State's\ninterest in finality to issuance of the appellate court\nmandate. That's consistent with the unbroken history, we\nthink, of drawing a sharp distinction between the moment\nat which the court of appeals relinquishes jurisdiction\nover a case and permitting the court to correct errors\nbefore then.\nIn fact, this Court also in Calderon\nspecifically noted that it was not a case where the\nmandate had been stayed pursuant to a (d)(1) motion.\nThere is no reason to distinguish a case involving the\nnon-issuance of a mandate under rule 41(b) from a case\ninvolving a stay of the mandate under rule (d)(1). Those\nare both circumstances in which the court of appeals still\nhas the case, and if the court of appeals still has the\ncase and recognizes a clear error in its prior decision or\nwishes to apply a new precedent to its decision or\ndiscovers that new evidence bears on a question, it has\nwide discretion to reconsider that judgment before\nrelinquishing jurisdiction over the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What if the court of\nappeals were talking about a point of law and the court of\nappeals issued an opinion saying we agree with three\ncircuits and disagree with four others? The losing party\nbrings it here and we deny certiorari. It goes back. And\nthen one of the judges on the panel says, gee, I think we\nshould have gone with the other circuits. Can they do\nthat at that point?\nMR. SHORS: Mr. Chief Justice, we're not saying\nthat this power is plenary. It is an abuse of discretion\nstandard. There would have to be a reason for doing so.\nIf the court sua sponte decided it had reached the wrong\nresult and wished to reconsider it, I don't think there's\nanything in rule 41(b) that would forbid it.\nThat does occasionally happen in en banc cases,\nand those are salutary appellate practices. If, for an\nexample, there's a national security case or some other\ncase and the court of appeals resolves it and denies an en\nbanc petition without prejudice, thinking that it's an\nimportant enough case that it should come immediately to\nthis Court, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the\ncourt of appeals reconsidering en banc the decision if\nthis Court denies review. Those are the kinds of\ncircumstances that -- that happen that are good appellate\npractices --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But that's an\nintervening circumstance. It's not a single judge\nchanging his mind.\nMR. SHORS: That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but\n-- but we think that the fact that this is a single judge\nchanging his mind is exactly why there is no abuse and why\nthis isn't a case like Calderon where the full court\nstepped in 2 days before the execution. This is a case\nwhere the same three judges who denied all habeas relief\nand denied rehearing came back later and said, you know\nwhat? We made a serious mistake. Mr. Thompson deserves\nan evidentiary hearing to test the reliability of his\ndeath sentence. Those are not circumstances unlike recall\nof the mandate by a full court of appeals --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we might address the --\nthe issue of whether this is that extraordinary. Number\none, the court of appeals did have reference to this\ndeposition in the petition for rehearing that was filed\nwith it. Number two, the -- the testimony of -- of the\npsychiatrist bears on the issue but the -- there was\na hearing on that point and another psychiatrist\ndisagreed.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Kennedy, I don't think\nthat's a reason that it is an abuse of discretion to fix\nthat error. The State makes a -- a lot of an issue in\ntheir reply brief of a fact that the court of appeals\nshould have gotten this right the first time. That is\nexactly why we have reconsideration. That is a\nquintessential illustration of why reconsideration is a\ngood idea. The court should have gotten something right\nthe first time, didn't, recognizes its error, and while it\nstill has jurisdiction over the case, fixes that error. I\nthink far from showing it's an abuse of discretion\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's -- let's\nassume for the moment -- you may disagree. Let's assume\nfor the moment that the Calderon standard applies. There\nhas to be an extraordinary showing. And the State has\nmade an argument here that this isn't that extraordinary.\nWe see these cases all the time.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Kennedy, I think that the\nCalderon standard should not be applied for several\nreasons. First, that this is a -- a challenge to a rule\nof general application, rule 41. There is no explanation\nin the State's brief, and indeed their amicus concedes\nthat -- that our reading of rule 41(b) is consistent with\nAEDPA. It is basically -- reconsideration is permitted by\nFederal law, and the only question is whether the State's\ninterest in finality becomes somehow more significant the\nmoment this Court denies certiorari.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So is recall permitted. I\nmean, courts have inherent right to recall too. I mean,\nthe same --\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the same situation existed\nin -- in Calderon.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, I think it's a\nlittle different only because in Calderon it was only an\ninherent power question, and this Court read the exercise\nof that inherent power in light of AEDPA. This case\ninvolves a rule of general application that authorizes a\npractice. And the -- the proper standard of review for --\nfor that practice is the abuse of discretion standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't -- but why\nwouldn't that be read in light of AEDPA as well? I mean,\nwhether it's a common law rule or a rule that -- that's\nwritten down, why equally shouldn't they be read in light\nof AEDPA?\nMR. SHORS: The abuse of discretion standard\nabsolutely would vary depending on the facts and\ncircumstances of a case. And if it appeared that a\nparticular exercise of rule 41(b) power was contrary to\nAEDPA, it would surely be an abuse of the court's\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, isn't it also true\nthat in Calderon the Court didn't merely hold that it was\nan abuse of discretion, they held it was a grave abuse of\ndiscretion, but even -- even more serious in that case?\nMR. SHORS: Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and --\nand the Court's opinion suggests that even if it hadn't\napplied the miscarriage of justice standard, it would have\nhad grave doubts about the exercise of that power\nprecisely because it involved the extraordinary\ncircumstance of reaching out and taking the case back from\nthe State court system.\nThe -- the fact that the Federal stay of\nexecution was in place I think is especially important to\n-- in addressing the State's argument, that there was\nnothing preventing the State from going back and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, this court --\nthis -- in this case the State court thought it was in the\nsystem. It -- it set an execution date.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Kennedy, it did set an\nexecution date but it was not informed either that the\nmandate hadn't issued or that there was a Federal court\nstay in place. In a decision in which both of those two\nfacts were brought to its attention, the Alley case, which\nwe cite in the red brief, the Tennessee Supreme Court\nrefused to set an execution date, ruling that it was\npremature. And that's consistent with 28 U.S.C., section\n2251, which says that if there's a Federal court stay of\nexecution in place, any execution date set by the State\ncourt is null and void.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What was the -- what\ncourt had granted the stay?\nMR. SHORS: The district court on February 17th\nof 2000 had -- had granted the stay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: And it remained in\neffect all that time?\nMR. SHORS: It remained in effect. The -- the\nFifth Circuit has come to that conclusion that -- that if\n-- unless the court of appeals takes a contrary action or\nthis Court takes a contrary action vacating the stay, that\nstay remains in place until the case is out of the Federal\ncourt system.\nBecause this case never became final, as the\nadvisory committee notes made clear -- and we think that\nthe cases that we've cited in the brief are largely\nundisputed on this point -- a court of appeals decision is\nnot final until it issues its mandate. Even the State in\nthe blue brief concedes that's true. And so the question\nin this case really is, if you still have jurisdiction\nover a case, under what circumstances can you correct an\nerror?\nAnd I think the miscarriage of justice standard\nis just way too harsh of a test under the circumstances\nbecause this case is a perfect illustration. There are\noverwhelmingly persuasive reasons for the court of appeals\nto have fixed its mistake in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we don't -- we don't have\nto be that harsh. We can -- I don't think that's the\nquestion. I think the question is under what\ncircumstances can you correct the error without having\nformally acted to extend the time for issuance of the\nmandate. I think one can draw a distinction between the\ncourt just sitting there and doing nothing for a year and\na half and -- and then, you know, during which it's\nreconsidering the case without notice to anybody, and a\nsituation in which a court takes formal action. We're\nextending the time. We could have a much lower standard\nfor the latter than -- than for the former.\nMR. SHORS: Justice Scalia, that's true, but\nthat imposes a burden under rule 41(b) that simply does\nnot exist in the text of the rule. The rule does not say\nby order. Previous versions of the rule did. Other rules\nin the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure do, and to\ngraft that onto it, despite the absence of that language\nand an understanding that that's how courts given the\nministerial function of -- of issuing mandates do their\npractice would be unfair.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is -- it's an abuse\nof discretion standard, and -- and it is certainly\nreasonable to apply one standard for abuse of discretion\nwhere the court has entered an order notifying all parties\nthat it's reconsidering the case and a different standard\nwhen it hasn't done that. I don't -- I don't think it has\nto be spelled out in the rule.\nMR. SHORS: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that\nthe rule does permit this practice, and if you look at the\nhistory of the rule, it makes it even more clear. The --\nthe advisory committee rejected a rule, akin to what the\nState is arguing today, that a mandate should be effective\nwhen it should have issued. And the reason they denied\nthat rule was because you can't tell from looking at the\ndocket whether the reason is a clerical error or the act\nof a judge delaying issuance in the mandate. That alone\nmakes clear that the committee had in mind circumstances\nin which judges would delay issuing their mandates without\nissuing formal orders to that effect.\nNumerous courts of appeals have come to that\nconclusion, and we think that's entirely consistent with\nthe rules, in addition to the reasons I -- I stated\nearlier, that I think in this case particularly, there\nwere reasons that the State was aware of the fact that the\ncourt was engaged in sua sponte reconsideration of its\ndecision.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Shors.\nMR. SHORS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Ms. Smith.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SMITH: Just briefly responding to the\nquestion of the stay of execution under section 2251,\nthere was a stay of execution extended by the district\ncourt pending the disposition of appeal -- of the appeal,\nbut appeals are disposed of by judgments, and that\njudgment was entered in January of 2003. The State had a\njudgment which was final. The court of appeals denied\nrehearing both by the panel and en banc. At that point,\nthe State, particularly after this Court denied cert, was\nentitled to rely on the finality of that judgment.\nThe State did not need the mandate in order to\nproceed. A mandate simply directs the district court what\nto do next. It was not necessary. It is not -- it is\ncompletely independent and -- and separate from the\ndisposition of the case on the merits.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did -- did the stay remain in\neffect in the district court, in your view?\nMS. SMITH: The stay of execution?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Respondent represents\nthat the stay of execution was entered in the district\ncourt and it stayed in effect.\nMS. SMITH: The stay of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At what point in your view did\nthat stay become dissolved?\nMS. SMITH: The stay of execution dissolved upon\nthe disposition of the appeal. The stay was pending the\nappeal. The appeal in our view was disposed of upon the\naffirmance of the denial of rehearing. That judgment was\nfinal when entered. Finality was suspended only during\nthe timely filed petition for rehearing. So once the\ncourt of appeals declined to exercise its error-correcting\nauthority to -- to rehear a case -- rehear the case either\nen banc or by panel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know that's your position,\nbut has any judge so ruled in this case?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, we have cited two cases\non page 13 of -- of our reply brief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may be right. In this\ncase did any -- either the court of appeals or the\ndistrict court terminate the stay?\nMS. SMITH: No. There was no formal dissolution\nof the stay. In our view it dissolved as an -- by\noperation of law.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Smith.\n"
