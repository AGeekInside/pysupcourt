WILLIAMS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe eight amendment requires that a\nsentencing jury in a capital case must consider\nmitigation, which this Court consistently has defined\nas related to a defendant's background, character, or\nthe circumstances of the offense. The Oregon Supreme\nCourt in this case has broadly construed circumstances\nof the offense to include evidence that is inconsistent\nwith the defendant's guilt. That holding is not\nconstitutionally compelled and does not further the\npurpose of having the sentencing jury consider\nmitigation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- possible that the\nSupreme Court of Oregon misapprehended some of the\nfacts in this case?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Justice O'Connor, it is\npossible that the Supreme Court was not aware that\ndefendant's mother had testified in the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- guilt phase, and that's\nbecause defendant did not raise that issue in the trial\ncourt, did not move to have her alibi testimony\nadmitted under the State statute that would have caused\nthe Court to address her prior --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- testimony.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- need to vacate the\njudgment and remand for that, or --\nMS. WILLIAMS: No --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do we just go ahead and\n--\nMS. WILLIAMS: No, Justice O'Connor, I don't\nbelieve that there needs to be any change in the\nposture of the case in order -- in order for the Court\nto address the Federal issue, and that's because the\nsignificance of the Oregon Supreme Court ruling doesn't\nturn on whether someone's testimony was admitted in the\nguilt phase, or not.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, under Oregon law, is\nit possible that some of the mother's testimony would\nbe otherwise admissible at the penalty stage?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Under Oregon law, under the\nmajority's holding in this case and the way they dealt\nwith the grandfather's prior testimony, on remand\ndefendant could have the mother's transcript from the\nguilt phase read, but what would be different about it\nunder the Oregon Supreme Court holding, and what we're\nasking the Court to address, is what they can do with\nthat alibi testimony, no matter what form it comes in.\nAnd that's the significant part of the Supreme Court\nholding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- may -- I want\nyou, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well. And\nperhaps the Respondent is the one to answer this\nquestion. Do you understand that they, on remand, if\nthey prevail in this case, would want to introduce the\nmother's live testimony?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I am not sure. Under the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're not sure --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- Oregon Supreme --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- all right.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- Court holding, they would\ncertainly be free to introduce her live testimony.\nIt's very clear from the Oregon Supreme Court decision\nthat any alibi evidence comes in, and that's not\nlimited to evidence that was presented in the guilt\nphase, or even witnesses who had been in the guilt\nphase. And -- but coming back to what the court's\nholding focuses on is how that alibi evidence can be\nused in the remanded proceeding. And not only does it\ncome in, and the primary statute on -- that they dealt\nwith for the grandfather's testimony is really a\nstatute that deals with admissibility of evidence --\nprevents the parties from having to go through making\nfoundations and other showings in order to get evidence\nadmitted. But, under the Oregon Supreme Court holding,\ndefense counsel can argue, based on that evidence, that\nthe jury should consider the possibility that defendant\nis innocent, as a mitigating factor in determining the\nsentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't you under --\nlook, first imagine that they don't want to introduce\none word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in\nthat transcript. Imagine that's the circumstance. If\nthat's the circumstance, then I should think there is\nno doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the\ntranscript are admissible. And I believe that under\nOregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary\ncase, a death-eligible person does have the right to\nargue in the sentencing proceeding. Think back over\nthat trial jury and you will see that there are doubts\nas to whether this man is guilty or not. Am I right --\nam I right on the first part? Am I right on the second\npart?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Justice Breyer, you are\ncorrect on the first part, but not on the second part,\nand that's because Oregon Supreme Court unanimously has\nconstrued Oregon's law on mitigation to say that what\nthe Oregon Legislature intended was to have as\nmitigation only those pieces that are required by the\neighth amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. In other words,\nprior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there\nwas a death case -- maybe there weren't very many, but\nwhere there was one, under Oregon law -- we have the\ntrial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the\nlawyer had no right to argue, under Oregon law. Think\nback about your certainty as to whether this individual\nis guilty.\nMS. WILLIAMS: That would be correct, Your\nHonor, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- unless the eighth amendment\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: And did the court say, here\n-- the Oregon court, in this case -- one, You can\nintroduce evidence, which it seems to have been\nmistaken about, about not being there, but that,\nsecond, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to\nargue the residual doubt?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor. And that's\nmost clear, from the dissent, as characterizing the\nquestion that the Court is addressing. And the Oregon\nSupreme Court opinion is in the -- excuse me -- the\nappendix to the cert petition. And at page 68\nof the appendix from the dissent, Justice Gillette\nwrites, \"The issue in this case is whether under the\nemphasized wording of that statutorily required jury\ninstruction,\" referring to the mitigation question,\n\"defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the\nevidence that he proffered. The majority says he was.\nI disagree.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. \"Consider the evidence\"\nis different from \"making an argument about the\nevidence.\" And what I didn't see in the -- Oregon's\nmajority opinion, is a statement that not only can this\nevidence be introduced -- because, after all, in a\nnormal case, the jury's heard it --\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's the same jury. But I\ndidn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question\nabout what kind of argument the defense had the right\nto make at the sentencing trial in respect to the\nresidual doubt that they might have from what they just\nheard. Can you point, in that opinion, to where they\nmade that statement that you just said they made about\nthe argument?\nMS. WILLIAMS: About the argument. Where I\nread -- no, I cannot point to specific language in the\nmajority opinion that says \"and defense counsel gets to\nmake an argument based on this, and the jury must\nconsider that.\" That comes from this Court's case law\nof how mitigating evidence must be treated once it is -\n-\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- required to be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to hold that.\nYou want us to say that a defense counsel can be\nadmonished by the judge not to make the argument that,\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final penalty. My\nclient claims he's innocent. If, in 20 years, it turns\nout that there is evidence exonerating him, it will be\ntoo late. I want you to consider that and give him\nlife.\" You can't make that argument.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, I -- our\nposition is that the eighth amendment does not require\nthat as a mitigating factor, that that is not one of\nthe circumstances of the offense, certainly not -- it\ndoesn't go to the defendant's character or background.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Williams, I don't -- I\ndon't understand all of this discussion about what the\n-- whether the State law would have produced the same\nresult, or not. We have never held, have we, that,\nwhere a State Supreme Court opinion clearly rests on a\nFederal ground, a Federal constitutional ground, we do\nnot have jurisdiction if there is a possible State\nground that would have left it -- led to the same\nresult? Have we ever held that?\nMS. WILLIAMS: No, Justice Scalia. In fact -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said just the\nopposite, haven't we?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't the thrust\nof my question, of course. The thrust of my question\nis that if, in fact, this evidence from the mother\ncomes in under State law, it comes in under State law,\nbecause -- I have the cite; you know the --\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- section I'm referring to.\nIf it comes in under State law, and they're not trying\nto prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon\nSupreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and\nnot about what arguments to be made, I don't see what\nreason we would have to reach an issue that isn't in\nthe case.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And, Justice Breyer, I think\nthe primary reason that the State is concerned with it\nis because of the broad holding that the Oregon Supreme\nCourt has announced under -- about what eight amendment\nrequires. When you combine that with what this Court\nhas said about what that means when evidence is\nmitigating evidence, then I think a necessary corollary\nof the Oregon Supreme Court holding is that defense\ncounsel does get to make that argument, and that the\njury must --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- be permitted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reason that the\ndefendant couldn't introduce other evidence in his\nresentencing trial, is there?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Under the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if he has\nother -- he says, \"I have other witnesses that go to\nthe residual-doubt question,\" and I would -- you know,\non retrial, if he prevails here, presumably he would be\nentitled to put in that evidence, as well.\nMS. WILLIAMS: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. The Oregon Supreme Court's conclusion is very\nbroad, that any alibi evidence comes in, and, as the\ndissent notes, that it also would not be limited simply\nto alibi evidence, but any evidence that is\ninconsistent with the guilt verdict in this case that\nwould form a basis for arguing that doubt about the\ndefendant's guilt should be a factor that the jury\nconsiders in responding to the mitigation question that\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what do we do with the\ncase --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- ask you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if your opponent\nacknowledges that -- or stipulates, in effect, that\nhe's not going to put anything in except what's already\nin the transcript? Then do we have a case?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think you still have a case,\nJustice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- about the right to\nargue? Is that what it is?\nMS. WILLIAMS: It's about the right to argue\nand what the jury is told to do with that. And it's\nalso that the State is going to have to live with this\ndecision in other capital cases, and other capital\ndefendants --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But our --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- may not be willing to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- jurisdiction is limited\nto reviewing a final judgment in this case.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We can't give an advisory\nopinion which would tell you what to do in other cases,\nwhich -- if that's all it does.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But I do not believe that a\nparty can force the Court into that position by\nstipulating that, although the State Supreme Court\nholding permits it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But would they're --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- to do much more --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- they would be giving up\nthe right that you claim you don't want them to have.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But they would give it up in a\nway that would basically lock the State into a box. We\ncouldn't get --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: For other cases --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- review here, we couldn't\nget --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but not for this case.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- review. Not for this case\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's why I'm concerned\nthat perhaps we're being confronted with a request for\nan advisory opinion. I don't know. Maybe they haven't\ncategorically agreed to what -- they may be going --\nwilling to say that they aren't going to put anything\nelse in. I don't really know that yet.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But I think their stipulation\nwould have to have two parts -- one, that they wouldn't\nput anything else in that wasn't presented in the guilt\nphase; and, two, that they wouldn't argue that, based\non that evidence, the jury should consider doubts about\nthe defendant's guilt in deciding what the appropriate\nsentence is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We may -- we may not have\nheld they have a constitutional right to make that\nargument, but do you -- do you think that State --\nthat you did -- you don't think they could even make\nthe argument as a matter of State procedure or anything\nat all?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Not on the mitigation\nquestion, Your Honor. And that's because of the way\nthe Oregon Supreme Court has construed the mitigation\nquestion, and has construed it to mean that only that\nwhich the eighth amendment requires is to be presented\nto the jury. The Legislature adopted that provision in\nresponse to this Court's mitigation case law, and\nthat's what they were intending to implement, and\nnothing more than that. I think States are free to do\nmore, but Oregon has not, as a matter of how the Oregon\nSupreme Court has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is --\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- construed the statute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about Oregon revised\nstat 163.150? It says, \"In a capital sentencing\nproceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all\nevidence previously offered and received may be\nconsidered for purposes of the sentencing hearing.\"\nNow, that's Oregon law. It's long been there. What\npossible reason could Oregon have for having that\nprovision, which is, \"Jury, you shall consider all the\nevidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the\ntrial\"? What reason could that be? How is it supposed\nto be relevant, \"all evidence,\" unless it's relevant to\nthe question of whether there is doubt?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Justice Breyer, I'd point you\nto the -- an earlier part of that same section of the\nstatute that says, \"Evidence may -- in the sentencing\nproceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter\nthat the court deems relevant to sentence.\" And their\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's a different\nprovision. I'm now thinking of the \"normal case,\"\nwhere you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the\nsentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law,\n\"Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously\nheard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes\nof what sentence they should impose.\" I just wonder\nwhat that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless\nthe jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's\nreally -- \"I'm completely certain he's guilty.\"\nMS. WILLIAMS: There -- it does serve a\ndifferent purpose, Your Honor, and that is that -- when\nyou read the entire section, what it -- what it does\nis, it says that, first of all, parties may present\nadditional evidence, if it's relevant. The -- they\ncannot present repetitive, or cumulative, evidence that\nhad been presented earlier. And then, the court's\nsupposed to inform that jury that what had come in the\nguilt phase may be considered in the penalty phase.\nAnd so -- and we've had the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if that\nprovision weren't there, the court would have to\ndecide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which\npieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant\nto the penalty, and not to the guilt. Whereas, by just\nallowing everything in, but just telling the jury, \"You\nonly consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and\nnot to the guilt,\" we -- the court does not have to\nenter into that item-by-item discrimination.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, what it does\nis, it allows the jury to know that just because\nsomething hasn't been re-presented to them in the\npenalty phase, but came in, in the guilt phase, it's\nopen for their consideration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Without any clue --\nMS. WILLIAMS: What it doesn't do --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- without any clue\nwhether there's a relevance test? I mean, here we're\ntalking about alibi evidence. If the determination of\nguilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty\nstage. That's why I found that statute so puzzling,\nthat the jury doesn't have a clue. They're told,\n\"Everything from the guilt phase comes in, you can\nconsider,\" but it doesn't sort out, doesn't even tell\nthem, relevance.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And, Justice Ginsburg, other\njury instructions will inform the jury how to use what\nevidence. And this does not mean that evidence that\nhas been presented is relevant for any purpose that\nanybody wants to put it to in the guilt phase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't the basis on\nwhich the court decided this case, is it?\nMS. WILLIAMS: No, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What we're saying here is\nthat this is a possible basis on which the Oregon\nSupreme Court might have decided this case. They did\nnot decide it on that case -- on that ground. They\ndecided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt,\nnot because of that provision of the statute, but\nbecause of the eighth amendment. And --\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I wasn't suggesting\nanything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was\njust curious about this statute that tells the jury,\n\"You can consider everything,\" and gives them no\nguidance, because some of it might be quite\ninappropriate for them to consider.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And the guidance does come\nfrom the other instructions that tell the jury what the\nspecific questions are that they must answer in the\npenalty phase, and what they take into account in\nanswering those questions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What has our constitutional\nlaw regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to\nconsider all mitigating factors -- the requirement that\nthey have to be allowed to be take into account of that\n-- what guidance has that provided? Has our\nconstitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating\nfactor?\nMS. WILLIAMS: In -- it has. And I believe\nthat in Franklin versus Lynaugh, this Court came very\nclose to deciding this question, that residual doubt is\nnot one of those mitigating factors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Apart from that, apart from\nthe fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we\nspecified what factors the jury can take into account\nby way of mitigation?\nMS. WILLIAMS: There are some factors that\nthe Court has described as being required as\nappropriate for mitigation. So, age, the mental state\nof the individual, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that if a\nState listed specific factors that could be taken into\naccount, and no others, that there would be\nconsiderable doubt whether this Court would allow such\na statute to stand?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think certainly with respect\nto the background and character of the defendant, but\nthe question here would be a fairly limited restriction\nto say that circumstances of the offense presume that\nthe offense has occurred and that the defendant is\nguilty; and so, evidence inconsistent with that guilt\nis not a circumstance of the offense.\nAnd I'd like to reserve time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nWilliams.\nMr. Shanmugam.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIt does not constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment to prohibit a capital defendant from\nrelitigating his guilt at sentencing. Contrary to the\nreasoning --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any view\non whether this question is properly before us, given\nthe Oregon statutes?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Mr. Chief Justice, our view\nis that this Court certainly could reach the\nconstitutional question presented. And, indeed, there\nare good reasons that this Court should.\nThe Oregon Supreme Court squarely confronted,\nand resolved, the Federal constitutional question, and\nit is ripe for this Court's review. It is true, as\nJustice O'Connor suggested at the outset, that the\nOregon Supreme Court appears to have been laboring\nunder a factual misimpression -- namely, that\nRespondent's mother did not testify at the initial\ntrial. That having been said, it appears to be clear\nthat Respondent was seeking -- and is still seeking,\neven before this Court -- to introduce the live\ntestimony of his mother.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, based on what you have\njust said, which was my understanding, too, assuming\nthe Oregon Supreme Court made the assumption that the\nmother's testimony had not been admitted at prior\ntrial, the only thing that the Oregon Supreme Court was\nruling on was the admissibility of new testimony, and\nthe use to which new testimony could be put, right?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is correct,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I do think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if the other side says,\n\"We totally give up any claim to introduce new\ntestimony,\" then don't we have a jurisdictional\nproblem?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that we would\nagree with the State of Oregon that a necessary\nimplication of the Oregon Supreme Court's holding,\nalbeit unstated, was that a defendant is\nconstitutionally entitled to argue residual doubt, as\nwell as to present evidence of residual doubt. Were\nthat not true, the failure to admit the evidence would,\nin some sense, be harmless, since it is true, certainly\nto some extent, that the mere presentation of the\nevidence might lead to the jury taking it into account\neven absent an argument or instruction to that effect.\nBut, as a practical matter, this Court has never\ndistinguished, in its consideration of mitigating\nfactors, between the presentation of argument or\nevidence and obtaining --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, we --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- an instruction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- have not, but it's\npossible for, it seems to me -- for all we know, it's\npossible that Oregon could say, \"Look, we have a\nstatute that says everything that was introduced at\ntrial may be considered. That may be a good thing or a\nbad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they\nmay consider it. But when the question comes, What new\nevidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing --\nthe sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict\nthat only to evidence which, in our view, is required\nby the eighth amendment.\"\nSo, if that is, then -- we don't -- I don't\nknow whether the Oregon Supreme Court took that view,\nor not. But if it did take that view, and, in this\ncase, the Respondents say, \"We no longer want to\nintroduce any new evidence,\" then we would not have a\ncase left, it seems to me.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is\ntrue, to some extent, Justice Souter, but I do think\nthat -- at least with regard to the question of what\nfactors are relevant to the ultimate determination,\nthat is governed by a quite different statutory\nprovision. And the Oregon Supreme Court construed that\nprovision to limit the mitigating factors that the jury\ncan take into account to those that are mandated by the\neighth amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And I would further note --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on that substantive\npoint, it does seem -- I assume a Governor could take\nthis into account in clemency?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, certainly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose the Governors\ncan do more than juries can. But, still, it seems odd\nto me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close\ncase. It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of\ncourse. It goes at least to whether or not the\ndefendant is obdurate in not accepting guilt. He says,\n\"I didn't do it.\"\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, acceptance of\nresponsibility may present different issues, but we\nwould submit that the fundamental problem with the\nconstitutional rule that the Oregon Supreme Court did\nexpressly adopt is that it would effectively allow\njurors, at their discretion, to apply what is a higher\nstandard of proof at capital sentencing than the\nreasonable-doubt standard, which, after all, is the\nstandard that applies in all other criminal contexts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, the evidence goes\nto explain why the defendant is taking the position\nthat he does. He said, \"I wasn't there.\" Now, it's\ntrue, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was -\n-\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the jury did --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at least it explains his\nattitude, his demeanor, his refusal to accept\nresponsibility. There's a reason for that.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the jury did determine,\nat the guilt phase, that the defendant was guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. And the fundamental point\nof the reasonable-doubt standard is that it is the\nhighest standard of law -- of proof known to the law,\nshort of absolute certainty. And I think, turning to\nthis Court's case law in the mitigation area, this\nCourt has, time and time again, limited mitigating\nevidence to evidence concerning the character or record\nof the defendant and the circumstances of the offense.\nAnd the reason for that, I think, is that the very\nconcept of mitigating evidence really does presuppose\nthat the defendant has committed the crime in the first\nplace. To put it another way, mitigating evidence is\nevidence that suggests that a defendant who has\ncommitted the crime is somehow less deserving of the\ndeath penalty. And going back to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would follow from\nthat, that if a State wanted to exclude the defense\nevidence on alibi from a sentencing jury's\nconsideration -- let's assume it's a new -- a new\nsentencing jury -- they could do that.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe that that\nwould be permissible. And I think, going back to the\njoint opinion in Woodson versus North Carolina, which\nwas really where this constitutional requirement of\nmitigation was first recognized, this Court did not\nsuggest in any way that, to the extent that\nindividualized consideration at sentencing is mandated,\na jury is entitled to consider any and all factors that\nit might think is relevant. Instead, the Court really\nrecognized a category of mitigating factors that is\nlimited to factors that are traditionally taken into\naccount at sentencing -- namely, the character or\nrecord of the defendant and the circumstances --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that's true --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- of the offense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- with respect to putting\nin new evidence. I understand your point. But there -\n- as a realistic matter, do you think it's possible to\nprevent a juror from deciding, \"I thought it was really\na closer case than beyond a reasonable doubt; and so,\nI'm a little hesitant about the death penalty\"?\nThere's no way to prevent that --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- from happening.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- as a practical matter, it\nmay be very difficult to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- prevent it. I'm not sure\nthat it is necessarily desirable for jurors to do that.\nAnd there is some suggestion, in the empirical\nevidence, that what actually goes on in the jury room\nis that jurors with some level of doubt about a\ndefendant's guilt will actually negotiate with other\njurors to ensure that a defendant is convicted, but\nends up not being sentenced to death.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's -- used on the\nother side and as a policy model, the model penal code,\nI think, says it's okay. It -- not really that it's\nokay. It should be considered.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, the model\npenal code does say that. It was adopted, I think, in\n1962. And I think that it is telling that, in the\nyears since 1962, since this Court recognized that the\ndeath penalty was constitutional again in the 1970s, no\nState has expressly adopted a statute that permits\nconsideration of residual doubt in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are a number of\nStates that do --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: To be sure, there are courts\nin several States -- I think we identified seven in our\nbrief --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- that have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- position is --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- recognized --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it's up to the\nStates, I take it, but it's not compelled by the eighth\namendment.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's exactly right, Justice\nGinsburg, just as it would be up to the States, at\ntheir discretion, to decide to simply adopt a higher\nstandard of proof across the board in capital cases. A\nState could certainly decide to adopt an absolute-\ncertainty standard. But I think my point is simply\nthat no State has expressly permitted consideration of\nresidual doubts. Courts have construed statutes in\nsome States to permit it, typically because those State\nstatutes contain broad language either with regard to\nthe definition of \"mitigating factors\" or with regard\nto the discretion the jury has in making the ultimate\nsentencing determination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you think -- you think\nthe Oregon Supreme Court might well come out that way,\nif it wished, although not resting on the eighth\namendment?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Might come out that way with\nregard to the right of a defendant to, say, argue\nresidual doubt?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there's no indication\nof that on the face of the opinion. And I think that,\nin some sense, it would be quite difficult for the\nOregon Supreme Court to do that, having construed the\nstatute that governs the determination that the jury\nactually makes at sentencing, to limit the factors that\nthe jury can consider to those that this Court has\nrecognized are constitutionally mandated under the\neighth amendment. So, as a practical matter, I think\nthe Oregon Supreme Court's reasoning in this case\nreally forecloses that interpretation.\nIf the Court has no further questions, we\nwould ask that the Court vacate the decision --\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Wolf.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WOLF\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. WOLF: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nAssociate Justices, may it please the Court:\nHopefully, I can simplify this matter for the\nCourt. As is set forth in our brief, and in our motion\nthat was recently filed, Mr. Guzek does disclaim any\nreliance on the eighth amendment of the United States\nConstitution as a basis for admitting, at his retrial -\n-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\ndoesn't matter. I mean, the question is what the\nOregon Supreme Court did, and it's quite clear that it\nbased its decision on the eighth amendment, not these\nvarious provisions of Oregon evidence law.\nMR. WOLF: Well, with all due respect, Mr.\nChief Justice, if Mr. Guzek does not intend to rely\nupon the eighth amendment, I think that this would moot\nthe case and that the -- this Court could then vacate\nthat portion of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You argue in -- an\neighth amendment case in the Supreme Court, you win on\nthe eighth amendment, then you leave the courthouse and\nsay, \"Well, I don't want it anymore,\" and you think\nthat moots the case?\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's still a\ndecision, binding in this case, giving you the right to\nadmit any evidence on residual doubt in the retrial.\nMR. WOLF: Well, I respectfully disagree. In\n-- because, in fact, we didn't really argue, in the\nOregon Supreme Court, that we were entitled,\nnecessarily, under the eighth amendment. Our argument\nwas primarily under the statute, that this statute says\nany evidence which came in should be admitted in the\nretrial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't\nquestion, or doubt, that the State Supreme Court\ndecision was based on the eighth amendment.\nMR. WOLF: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we vacate it and the\ncase is remanded on that ground, I assume it's still\nopen for you to point out to the Oregon Supreme Court\nthat they were in error about the -- about the status\nof the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it\nadmitted on that ground. Why isn't that the way to\nhandle the matter, rather than your --\nMR. WOLF: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- as you express it,\n\"mooting the case\"?\nMR. WOLF: Well, that -- we believe that we\nare entitled to present it under State law, and we\nthink that is the resolution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that -- there\nwould still remain -- whether you mooted the case, or\nwhether we vacated and then it was left to the Oregon\nSupreme Court whether to let this evidence in -- there\nwould still remain the question of what kind of an\ninstruction the jury can be given regarding the\nconsideration of this evidence for purposes not of\ndetermining whether a guilty person should not be given\nthe death penalty, but, rather, for purpose of\nconsidering whether the guilt is clear enough. I mean,\nthat's -- that issue would still remain, wouldn't it?\nMR. WOLF: Well, not necessarily. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it?\nMR. WOLF: Well, I think, under Oregon law,\nwe are entitled to put on -- well, first we have to\ndistinguish between these unitary juries and these\nretrial juries, because, of course, the retrial jury\nhas not heard the evidence from the guilt/innocence\nphase, from the original trial. And in the event that\na retrial jury is hearing -- they're hearing this\nevidence for the first time, and the State should not\nbe permitted to just put on the evidence that they\nthink helps aggravate the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand, but what\nare you -- what are you going to argue to that jury?\nAre you going to argue to that jury, you know, that,\n\"Yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of\nhis guilt was really not all that clear, and you should\ntake that into\" -- don't you want to make that argument?\nMR. WOLF: Well, that's a potential argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Oregon Supreme Court\nsays you can make that argument, because the eighth\namendment requires you to be able to make that\nargument.\nMR. WOLF: But we think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what the State says is,\n\"No, the eighth amendment requires no such thing.\" So,\nthe issue hasn't gone away. It's still here. It's\nhere in this very case.\nMR. WOLF: Well, we think we're entitled to\nmake it, under Oregon law, in a -- regardless of\nwhether we're entitled to make it under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What the --\nMR. WOLF: -- eighth amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. You're entitled\nto get the evidence in, under Oregon law, but the\nquestion of how that evidence can properly be used by\nthe jury has been decided by the Oregon Supreme Court\nonly on the basis of the eighth amendment, not on the\nbasis of any Oregon statute.\nMR. WOLF: I disagree, Justice Scalia,\nbecause the court has said that this evidence,\nregardless -- with respect to the grandfather --\nregardless of its substance, is to be admitted. And if\nit's to be admitted, it is to be considered. The\nstatute with --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But considered --\nMR. WOLF: -- which Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- for what? That's the\nproblem. I mean, here is someone who's been found\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nMR. WOLF: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And I don't see how it's\nrelevant to go in at sentencing and say, \"Oh, but there\nare all these doubts.\" I mean, by finding \"beyond a\nreasonable doubt,\" there isn't a reasonable doubt left.\nMR. WOLF: The --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You -- I don't see how\nthat's open to argument. You can say, \"Consider the\nevidence that shows he's a good person underneath it\nall,\" or, \"There -- he has some moral values that ought\nto be respected,\" or something like that, or, \"He's\ncapable of doing good things.\" But I don't see how you\ncan argue doubt.\nMR. WOLF: Well, first of all, we never did\nargue doubt. The words \"residual doubt\" never occurred\nin this -- in the trial court, they never appeared\nbefore the Oregon Supreme Court. Lingering residual\ndoubt was never argued. But in the hypothetical case,\nthe defendant is entitled, and the statute instructs\nthe jury, to consider the evidence from both phases of\nthe trial for all -- for the sentencing purposes. And\nthe Oregon statute is sui generis in the sense that we\nhave a statute that has four questions the jury must\nanswer beyond a reasonable -- the first three must be\nanswered beyond a reasonable doubt. And these are\nfactual questions related to the crime. Did the\ndefendant act deliberately? So, in essence, what we\nhave is -- a case which is charged as an aggravated\nmurder does not make the defendant death-eligible at\nthat point. The defendant is not death-eligible until\nhe is first convicted of aggravated murder beyond a\nreasonable doubt, and then, in the penalty phase, he is\nfound to have committed the act deliberately, he is\nfound to have -- the victim should not have -- did not\nprovoke him, and his response was unreasonable to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the penalty phase.\nMR. WOLF: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the penalty phase?\nMR. WOLF: It has not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hasn't that already been found\nin the guilt phase?\nMR. WOLF: No. No, Your Honor. Those are\npenalty phase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You --\nMR. WOLF: -- questions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can be found guilty of\nmurder when you didn't intend to kill?\nMR. WOLF: No, you must be found guilty of\nintentional murder. But, in the penalty phase, the\nvery first question in our statute, which appears in\nthe appendix of the State's brief, is whether the\nconducts of the defendant that caused the death of the\ndeceased was committed deliberately and with the\nreasonable expectation that the death of the deceased,\nor another, would result. So, it's additional mental\nstate, a factual determination, that goes beyond\nwhether you intentionally caused death. That--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to be very strange,\nbecause I think our cases require -- require that for\ndeath eligibility, and --\nMR. WOLF: Well, I don't disagree with you,\nYour Honor, and -- however, our petition in this matter\nwas not granted. But the -- this -- that is the -- the\npoint is that our statute is very unique. I don't know\nof any other --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have two questions, if I\nmay. One -- of course, that wouldn't -- the alibi\nevidence would already have been rejected, whether\nthere was deliberateness or not, so that would not\nsupport putting in the alibi evidence. But the second\nquestion I have -- I wanted to be sure we're clear on -\n- do you intend, on the future hearing, to introduce\nanything other than the transcript of the prior\nproceeding? Do you intend to introduce live witnesses\nunder -- as you may, perhaps, be able to, under Oregon\nlaw?\nMR. WOLF: Well, first of all --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because I got the\nimpression, from your motion to dismiss the writ as\nimprovidently granted, that you did not. But I don't\nsee anything unequivocally establishing that in the\nrecord.\nMR. WOLF: Well, we believe that we are\nentitled to -- clearly, under the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To --\nMR. WOLF: -- statute, to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To put in --\nMR. WOLF: -- put on the live testimony of\nthe -- of the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nMR. WOLF: -- of the mother.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But is that --\nMR. WOLF: The statute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, there definitely is a\ncase before us, then.\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you intend to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then there was really no\nbasis for your motion to dismiss the writ as\nimprovidently granted, if that's true.\nMR. WOLF: Well, perhaps not as improvidently\ngranted, but if there is -- if the evidence comes in,\nunder Oregon law, and we are disavowing any reliance on\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But under --\nMR. WOLF: -- eighth amendment --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- Oregon law, what is not\nclear is -- you want to put the mother on the stand.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, do you want to go into\nanything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that --\nMR. WOLF: -- for us to go into anything that\nwasn't raised in the original trial, that would have to\nbe otherwise relevant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. So --\nMR. WOLF: And so, for example, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that's why I want to know\nthat. That's what's ambiguous.\nMR. WOLF: -- if mom --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, you only get to go\ninto something if it was not otherwise -- if it is\notherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to.\nThe reason they think it is relevant is because of a\nconstitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court.\nSo, if you want to go into something, we have to decide\nwhether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant. If you\nwant to ask the same thing, that's just a question of\nwhether you have to have a transcript or a live\nwitness. And I don't know that that's a question that\ndepends on their constitutional holding. So, I want to\nknow, Do you want to go into things that are not there\nin the original trial, yes or no?\nMR. WOLF: Well, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that\nanswer, in light of the previous discussion about the\ndeliberate -- deliberately.\nMR. WOLF: Well, the deliberateness, Your\nHonor -- to this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Oregon courts take\nthe position that, in the sentencing phase, the\n\"deliberately\" requirement must be judged just by what\nwas in -- introduced in the guilt phase?\nMR. WOLF: No, it -- it's -- additional\nevidence can be put on.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you told us additional\nevidence on deliberation can be put in the -- in the\nsentencing phase. But then you're saying that you're\nnot going to do that.\nMR. WOLF: Well, I guess it depends on the\nnature of -- if it is to impeach the codefendant's\ntestimony, if that's deemed to be additional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. No, I'm not\nsaying that. I -- look, until this minute, you might\nhave been equivocal. You're quite right, I was leading\nyou.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that doesn't mean you\ncan't say yes or no. You can decide right now. So,\ndecide. And I'm -- I will be bound by the answer, as I\nthink we all are. And if your answer is, \"Yes, I want\nto go into otherwise relevant things,\" I'd like to know\nthat. And if the answer is no, I want to know that,\ntoo.\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would pass, if I were you.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. WOLF: Well, I didn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, if you pass -- if you\npass, I will think you do. And as long as you do, I\nthink we have to decide whether it is, or is not,\notherwise relevant. I'm being totally open and honest\nwith you.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. WOLF: Well, as a matter of Oregon law,\nwe think we can -- we could put mom on, she could\ntestify verbatim from her original trial, and she could\nbe asked, or she could say, \"And I love my son. Please\ndon't kill him.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm not being tricky\nabout it. I want to know if we have to go to the words\n\"otherwise relevant\" in the Oregon statute --\n\"otherwise relevant,\" particularly in respect to this\nquestion of residual doubt.\nMR. WOLF: Well, the -- it -- I'd ask --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I really would like an\nanswer, if possible.\nMR. WOLF: Well, it -- the answer, Your\nHonor, is, I'd ask the Court to look to page 3 of our\nbrief, where the statute is set forth, and look\ncarefully at the way that statute is worded, which\nsays, \"Either party may recall any witness who\ntestified at the prior trial or sentencing proceeding\nand may present additional relevant evidence.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. And they said that\nrelevance is -- of residual doubt is relevant. And the\nreason that it's relevant is because the Constitution\nof the United States requires the jury to hear it.\nMR. WOLF: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is what I am focusing\non, and I want to know if you want to go into\n\"otherwise relevant,\" for that reason.\nMR. WOLF: Well, with all respect, the Oregon\nSupreme Court did not say residual doubt was\nadmissible. And residual doubt was never argued to the\ntrial court, to the Oregon Supreme Court; and,\ntherefore, whether or not it can come in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It said that your\nalibi defense, that had been rejected by the prior\njury, was relevant under the eighth amendment.\nMR. WOLF: It did say that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. WOLF: But it's relevant to this idea of\ndeliberation. For example, if the defendant -- the\ncodefendants have testified that the -- Mr. Guzek is\nthe mastermind of this, and that he helped plan this.\nIf the alibi goes to whether or not he was present for\nall of those events that relate to this issue --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That --\nMR. WOLF: -- of deliberation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that brings up a\nquestion I have. Particularly under the resentencing\nprovision, it looks like the sentencing trial is going\nto be just a rerun of the guilt trial, because your\nmain evidence that you want to put in is alibi\nevidence, \"I didn't do it.\" So, you're going to say,\n\"Here's\" -- the mother is going to say, \"I -- he was at\nhome.\" And then, presumably, the State gets to put on\nall of its witnesses, saying, \"No, here are the people\nwho saw him do it,\" and blah, blah, blah. And so, it's\njust the same trial all over again.\nMR. WOLF: It could be. But it could be a\ndifferent trial, such as we would propose in this case\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They used to have --\nMR. WOLF: -- in the sense that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- two trials. I mean, you\nknow, that's the whole problem here. Your client has\nbeen tried as to whether he committed the offense, and\nfound guilty, and now you --\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- now you want to\nrelitigate the same matter. I don't --\nMR. WOLF: Not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --\nMR. WOLF: -- not that the same matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And on the basis that the\nConstitution requires you to be able to relitigate the\nsame matter two times in the same criminal proceeding,\nthat doesn't seem, to me, right.\nMR. WOLF: Well, but the -- but the factual -\n- there are factual determinations to be made in the\nsentencing proceeding that are a continuation of the\noriginal trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, let's go to the\nconstitutional --\nMR. WOLF: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- issue. Now, let's\nimagine we have a trial. And at the trial, we have a\nlot of evidence about the alibi.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what the State Court\nsays, \"This is our law. When a person is\" -- now go to\nthe sentencing phase, the jury has heard it --\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? So, they take it into\naccount. And, moreover, we tell them they have to\nconsider it.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? That's a State law.\nNow, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle,\nand now we go back just to the sentencing? Here's what\nwe do. We introduce the transcript. And, moreover, we\nintroduce some live witnesses to say what they said\nbefore, but nothing else.\nNow, you're saying there is a constitutional\nright to present an additional witness on the matter\nthat has already been litigated to go into things that\nwere not there in the trial before.\nMR. WOLF: Well, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, my goodness, if you had\nreal evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the\nfirst time? And if, in fact, you -- it's not such good\nevidence, and so forth, why does the State have to\nwaste its time to hear some more about the alibi that\nyou didn't put in the first time? I mean, you know,\nthat's what you're saying the Constitution protects.\nI'm being a little skeptical. I want to know what your\nanswer is.\nMR. WOLF: Well, we did put it in the first\ntime in this case, and we don't necessarily need to\nrely on the eighth amendment, we believe, to put it in,\nif --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm agreeing with you --\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- insofar as you have a\nright to put in what you've put in the first time.\nMR. WOLF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you on that\none. But you said you wanted to do something else.\nYou wouldn't say, \"We don't want to do something else.\"\nYou --\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- want to do more.\nMR. WOLF: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, in the \"more\" part,\nwhere does the Constitution protect you? I'm willing\nto, at least hypothetically, go with you on the\nprotection for what they already heard.\nMR. WOLF: The Constitution protects us in\nthe sense that it allows us to rebut and respond and\nreply to evidence offered by the State in aggravation\nof a sentence of death. And if they're offering\nevidence that he is -- he acted deliberately, we have a\nright to respond to that. We don't have to sit there\nwith our hands tied behind our back.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And your --\nMR. WOLF: And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- response is that he\nwasn't there. It's one thing to say, \"It was\nintentional, but you didn't prove deliberate.\" The\nother thing is to say, \"He wasn't there. He didn't\ncommit the crime in the first place.\" Those are two\nquite different things.\nMR. WOLF: Well, but it's also a question of,\n\"How much of it was he there for?\" -- as in Green. Was\nhe there when he -- was he there for the planning\nstage? Because the jury is to consider all of the\nevidence. So, if he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- well, I guess\nit -- I guess it depends on what you mean by an\n\"alibi.\" If all you mean by an \"alibi\" is that, for\npart of the offense, he was somewhere -- I thought an\nalibi meant, \"I am not guilty, because I was not\nthere.\" That's what I thought an alibi was --\nMR. WOLF: I think \"alibi\" means, \"I was\nsomewhere else at the time of the offense.\" But if\nwhat the jury --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it sounds --\nMR. WOLF: -- has considered --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- like you're trying to\nrelitigate that question at the sentencing hearing.\nAnd, certainly, the eighth amendment does not require\nthat.\nMR. WOLF: No.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, to the extent the\nOregon Supreme Court thought that, and rested its\nholding on that, we ought to reject it out of hand.\nMR. WOLF: Well, but our statute requires the\njury, in the sentencing phase, to make these additional\nfactual determinations about the offense.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's up to the\ncourt, on remand, but it ought to be straightened out\nthat the eighth amendment does not require relitigation\nof where the defendant was at the time of the murder.\nThat was the basis for the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\"\nfinding of guilt.\nMR. WOLF: Of guilt, but not necessarily of\nthe -- but if the evidence of deliberation occurred at\nother events in the chain of events, than the alibi is\nrelevant to the sentencing question the jury must\ndecide. It's also relevant to -- perhaps, to\nprovocation. So, there are factual determinations that\nthe sentencing jury has to make.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you put it -- make it\nconcrete for this case? Because I don't see that there\nwould be -- I mean, if the action is intentional, and\nthe question was whether it was deliberate, what\nplanning here would have gone on in some different\ntimeframe?\nMR. WOLF: Well, there was -- there was a\ntimeframe of -- there was evidence that they -- the\ncodefendants testified that the -- the three of them\nplanned to do another burglary of a different house,\nand then -- the codefendants' timeframes are rather\nfuzzy, but then they went back, at some point, to the\ndefendant's father -- house to obtain weapons, and then\nwent on to the ultimate victim's house. So, to the\nextent that this deliberation includes events that\noccurred before the actual homicide, it's relevant to\nthis deliberation question.\nAnd, additionally, the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't -- I still\ndon't understand. You say that there was -- there had\nto be proof for conviction and guilt -- of guilt of\nintentional conduct. And this is a simple story that's\ntold: they wanted to go to one house, too many lights\non in that house; they were frustrated, they wanted to\ngo someplace else, so they came upon the aunt and uncle\nof the defendant's former girlfriend.\nMR. WOLF: Well, it was a much longer\ntimeframe than that. There was testimony that they\nwent back to town, and went to the father's house and\nobtained weapons before they went to the house where\nthe homicides occurred.\nThe other issue is that there has been\nsubsequent evidence, since the first trial. These\ncodefendants have recanted certain statements. They\nhave recanted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to put that\nin?\nMR. WOLF: Yes. We believe that that's --\nwe're entitled to do that to rebut --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any new -- any new\nevidence relevant to alibi or degree of guilt.\nMR. WOLF: Not to -- no, I wouldn't\ncharacterize it as to alibi. Any evidence that goes to\nthe sentencing questions the jury must consider, to\ndeliberation, to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you -- and you\nwant to retain the right to put in whatever evidence is\nrelevant on those questions.\nMR. WOLF: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then what was\nall the discussion about the mother's having -- then,\nwhen you go back, you can put on anything, whether it\nwas presented before, or not, right? Because the\neighth amendment requires that, according to the Oregon\nSupreme Court.\nMR. WOLF: Well, whether it's required under\nthe eighth amendment, or not, is for you to decide,\nobviously, but we think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. WOLF: -- that it's whether or not Oregon\nlaw also requires it. And we believe, under Oregon\nlaw, we're entitled to put this on, we're entitled to\nrebut this. For example, Justice Kennedy was talking\nabout a scenario -- and, in this very case, the joint\nappendix, at page 92, the prosecutor in this case --\nthis is an excerpt from the trial -- was trying to get\nin evidence that the defendant was being manipulative.\nAnd, at this point, the alibi evidence had been\nexcluded. And so, the fact that the defendant was not\ntaking responsibility, perhaps was being deemed as\nmanipulating people by trying to get them to come\nforward to say, \"I wasn't there,\" then alibi is\nrelevant to respond -- to rebut and respond to that\nkind of an argument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Whatever Oregon law might\nsay, or not say, it appears that this Supreme -- Oregon\nSupreme Court was acting under what it thought was the\ncompulsion of the eighth amendment. If it's wrong\nabout that, you can make your argument about what\nOregon law should be, without any eighth amendment\nconstraint.\nMR. WOLF: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does seem that this\ncourt was operating on the assumption that the eighth\namendment required it to let in this alibi and other\nevidence.\nMR. WOLF: And we think -- we agree that the\nOregon Supreme Court went farther than it needed to in\nthis case in order to decide the issue, because, under\nOregon law, mom testified --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, you know, we're being\nasked to decide whether Oregon Supreme Court correctly\ninterpreted the Federal Constitution. And you seem to\nbe making most of your argument to the effect, \"Well,\nwe don't really need that holding. We can prevail on\nOregon law.\"\nMR. WOLF: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But are you going to make\nany argument in support of the decision made by the\nOregon Supreme Court?\nMR. WOLF: No, not as long as the State of\nOregon agrees that this statute operates in an\nevenhanded fashion. In other words, if they get to\nrecall witnesses who originally testified, or present\ntranscript testimony, then we should have the same\nright.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- so odd. It -- almost\nas though we should appoint some amicus here, Counsel,\nto argue in support of the merits.\nMR. WOLF: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, you don't seem to\nbe doing that.\nMR. WOLF: Well, Your Honor, on the merits,\nwe --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's very strange.\nMR. WOLF: Well, we think that the -- that\nthe Oregon Supreme Court decision was correct in -- on\nthe -- on the eighth amendment. And we think it's --\nbut it's -- not necessarily for the reasons stated by\nthe Oregon Supreme Court. And the fact is that if the\nOregon Supreme Court held that we have a right to -- we\nbelieve that we have a right to respond to any evidence\nthey offer on aggravation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about --\nfor example, the single most important feature leading\njuries to recommend against death, apparently, from the\nstudies, is their residual doubt. Every juror who\nhears sentencing matters directly after a trial\nautomatically takes that into account. Therefore,\nthose who are resentenced and have a new jury should\nhave the same kind of right. Otherwise, it's cruel and\nunusual.\nNow, I made that argument. You didn't\nmake it. But it seems to me that there are several\narguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon\nSupreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that\nit is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary\nrules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes\nin, et cetera.\nMR. WOLF: Well, we think that if -- by\ndirecting that the jury consider all evidence in both\nphases of the trial, it must be relevant. Why else\nwould they instruct the jury to consider such evidence,\nunless it was relevant to the sentencing questions\nthe jury must answer? And obviously I agree with you,\nJustice Breyer, that if the -- if a defendant must run\nthe gamut of having -- we have to remember that the\nfirst trial was set aside because it was defective in\nsome way. And it would be an anomalous result for the\nresentencing jury to not be entitled to hear what the\nfirst jury heard when the defendant had an\nunconstitutional, or a defective, trial. So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Wolf, in view of the\ndirection this discussion is going in, I want to go\nback to something that I really think we all thought we\nhad passed but I would like to go back and get clear\non. My recollection is that you stated, in your answer\nto Justice Stevens, that you currently maintain that\nyou have a right to recall the mother to the stand at\nthe -- at the sentencing proceeding.\nMy question, which is prompted by your motion\n-- my question is, Is it your present intention to call\nthe mother to the stand, or is it your present\nintention to use the mother's testimony, which we all -\n- I understand to be admissible? Are you going to call\nher, or not?\nMR. WOLF: Well, we would intend to call her.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You do intend to call her.\nMR. WOLF: Because we think it's important --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm not asking why. I\njust want to know whether you are. And your\nrepresentation to me is that you do intend to call her\nas a live witness as the -- at the resentencing.\nMR. WOLF: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. WOLF: And I'd like to answer the reason\nfor that, because we think the jury is entitled to see\nher demeanor and gauge, based on how she testifies, how\nbelievable she is. We think it's much -- we think it's\nbetter for a jury to be able to see a live witness than\nhear a cold transcript being read by surrogates.\nAnd so, of course, in -- as we know, in -- if\nshe were to stray from what she testified at the\noriginal trial, of course she would be impeached with,\n\"Well, you didn't testify about that the first time.\"\nBut the jury, we think, as the statute clearly\nindicates, should allow witnesses who testified\noriginally to be recalled, unless, for some reason,\nthey're unavailable --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Wolf, I --\nMR. WOLF: -- in which case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I had misunderstood\nsomething. There's going to be a new sentencing, but\nthere also is going to be a new trial, is there, on\nthe merits?\nMR. WOLF: No. There --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why -- because you\nmentioned, earlier, about the defect in the trial.\nMR. WOLF: The convictions -- well, the\ndefect was in the penalty phase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nMR. WOLF: And so, the convictions are\naffirmed. The jury is going to be instructed, \"The\ndefendant stands convicted, has been found convicted\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" It is to decide these four\nquestions: Did he act deliberately? Does he\nconstitute a future danger? And, to the extent the\nGovernment puts on evidence that addresses those\nconcerns, we believe we have the right to respond to\nthat.\nAnd also -- we also have to remember that the\n-- that the alibi in this case was -- really was\noffered as impeachment of the codefendants. The\ncodefendants are really the only evidence that links\nthe defendant to these crimes. And so, to the extent\nthat -- it's impeachment by contradiction. So, while\nthey may find that if the codefendants say, \"He did A,\nB, and C,\" and mom says, \"No, he was with me,\" it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only\nthat they should disbelieve the codefendants. And that\nis a -- although it seems incongruous, that's standard\nimpeachment by contradiction. The jury is given an\ninstruction that they're to consider it for the limited\npurpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants,\nbut not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi.\nAnd that happens in trials every day. So, we don't\nthink it's that unusual for the -- if the evidence\nrelates to the sentencing questions the jury must\nconsider, then it should come in.\nSo, the other point that I think is important\nin this case is that the -- you know, the -- it's\nreally not unlike this -- cases that this Court has\nheld, Sumner versus Shuman, and Skipper. If the\nGovernment puts on evidence --\nI see my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Williams, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Williams, I have one\nquestion. I'm not sure it goes to our eighth amendment\nquestion before us, but I honestly don't understand\nwhat your statute is all about. It says that after\nhaving been convicted of aggravated murder --\naggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall be\npresented with the following questions. Number one,\nwhether the conduct of the defendant that caused the\ndeath of the deceased was committed deliberately and\nwith the reasonable expectation that death of the\ndeceased, or another, would result. Don't you have to\nfind that in order to convict of aggravated murder?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, we copied from\nTexas on those special issues. And so, in the\nguilt phase, what you have to establish is the\ndefendant acted intentionally. And that's what's\nrequired as far as a constitutional state of mind.\nAnd the deliberateness question is sort of an\nintentional-plus.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Plus, okay.\nMS. WILLIAMS: It's from an additional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I gotcha.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- finding, beyond\nintentional, that the State has to then establish in\nthe penalty phase.\nTwo quick points. First, on how this\nevidence was offered. It was not offered as\nimpeachment evidence. It was not offered under any\nState statute. If you look in the joint appendix, the\nsecond volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to\nrely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence. And\nthen there's an accompanying memo that follows. And,\nalso, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a\ncolloquy between defense counsel and the trial court,\nwhere defense counsel says, \"Your Honor, I made it\nvery clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation.\nIt goes to the circumstances of the crime. It's\nmitigating evidence that someone is not there.\" And,\nlater, circumstances of the offense is part of the\nfourth question, which, in Oregon, is the mitigation\nquestion. If the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the 2:16 a.m. alarm clock\nin the original trial, or not?\nMS. WILLIAMS: The mother's testimony about\nthe time from --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- 2:10 a.m. to 4:20 is in the\nguilt phase of the trial.\nAnd again from the colloquy, \"If you're not\nthere, that is certainly mitigating.\"\nAnd let me just mention, in terms of the\ntiming of the alibi evidence, the grandfather's alibi\ncovered from 9 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in the\nmorning; the mother's, from 2:10 in the morning til\n4:20. The crimes occurred in the early morning hours.\nAnd so, there isn't any way to parse this out and say\nthat the alibi testimony might have been relevant, in\nsome small piece, on deliberateness.\nTo the extent that the State puts on\nadditional evidence to establish deliberateness, of\ncourse defendant can respond to that additional\nevidence, but the State doesn't make the question of\nwhether the defendant was there wide open again in the\npenalty phase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nWilliams.\n"
