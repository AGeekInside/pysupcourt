        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in 04-433, Anza v. Ideal Steel\nSupply Corporation.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case concerns use of alleged fraud in\nthe underpayment of taxes as the predicate for a treble\ndamages civil RICO action. Respondent Ideal Steel\nconcedes that it was not defrauded, but it,\nnonetheless, claims lost profits when National failed\nto pay State sales taxes and thereby offered a lower\noverall price to consumers. Our position is that\nIdeal's injury is too indirect as a matter of law under\nRICO.\nIn reinstating Ideal's RICO claims against\nNational, however, the Second Circuit committed two\nerrors. First, it substituted a direct targeting test\nthat credited the plaintiff's allegations of intent\ninstead of applying this Court's test for proximate\ncausation in the Holmes case. And second, the Second\nCircuit permitted Ideal to satisfy the reliance\nrequirement by invoking the State of New York's\nreliance on the truth of National's allegedly false tax\nreturns. Both errors transformed civil RICO into a\nlitigation weapon of great destructive force for\ndefendants who will be forced to defend, beyond the\npleading stages, damages claims of the most attenuated\nand indirect character.\nWith respect to our first argument, proximate\ncause, the court below erred by not applying this\nCourt's test in Holmes and also by failing to take into\naccount the fact that fraud is a statutory violation\nthat -- for which the plaintiff needs to be within the\nzone of interest. Quite simply, because Ideal was not\nthe defrauded party, it is not within the zone of\ninterest protected by the fraud statute.\nWith respect to the Holmes factors, for three\nreasons the -- Ideal Steel is unable to plead proximate\ncause.\nFirst, in Holmes, this Court made clear that\nwhere there's an indirect plaintiff, the claims are\ndifficult to prove in terms of ascertaining what the\nlevel of damages is. That is particularly true in this\ncase because of the highly attenuated chain of\ncausation that allege -- that Ideal alleges as a\nfactual matter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't there something\ndifferent here? Because in -- in Holmes, the -- the\nparty that was claiming the -- sort of the ultimate\ndamage was damaged because other people up the line\nwere damaged, the -- the shareholders and then the\nbroker-dealers and so on. There was a kind of a direct\nline of -- of causation. But the people who were\nclaiming were at the tail end of it.\nHere, the causation between the -- or the --\nor the cause of the harm to -- to the clients on -- on\nthe other side was -- was direct. It was direct\ncompetition harm. So we are in a different situation\nfrom Holmes. In other words, they -- they weren't --\nthe -- the plaintiffs in this case were not injured\nsimply because New York lost some money. They were\ninjured in -- in their own right by -- by the\ncompetition between them and your client.\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't agree, Justice\nSouter, and here's why. In Holmes, the customers were\nthe ones who were denied proximate cause in this\ndecision -- in -- in the Court's decision. They stood\nin a direct line from the harm that was caused when the\ncompanies were defrauded and the stock value caused the\nbrokerage to go down. It was completely foreseeable\nthat customers that owned the shares in those firms\nwould also suffer direct harm.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but they suffered the\nharm because the firm suffered the harm. There was --\nthere was -- there's a word there. There was -- there\nwas a victim in -- in the direct line of causation, if\nyou will, between them and -- and the -- and the\noffending RICO party. Here, there's -- there's nobody\nin between the two of them.\nMR. FREDERICK: That -- that's not so. There\nis, and New York is in between them in this respect.\nIf -- Ideal is asserting that because the taxes had not\nbeen charged and then paid to the State of New York,\nthat National gained a competitive advantage. But I\nthink the Court has been clear that the competitive\nharms -- and this was true in the Associated General\nContracting case in which the Court in Holmes relied\ndirectly -- is not going to be sufficient when there\nare multiple steps in the chain.\nHere, as a factual matter, Justice Souter,\nthey have to be able to link every individual sale for\nwhich there was not a tax paid, assert that that person\nwas wrongfully not charged a tax. Under New York law,\nunder certain circumstances, if a contractor has a\ncertificate, it's not appropriate for the vendor in\nthis case to charge the sales tax. And then they have\nto be able to show that they would have gotten the sale\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why -- why is that\ntrue? Let's assume that they could establish that\nthere was a purpose and an intent to adopt this -- this\ntax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to\nundermine and -- and injure the competitor, and they\nshow that this scheme began to work and that their\nreputation as a lower-cost competitor was -- was well\nestablished. Why -- why isn't that enough?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because this Court rejected a\nsimilar theory in section 4 of the Clayton Act context\nwhere it held that a specific intent to injure is not\nsufficient as a pleading matter. The Court in that\ncase held that where an association had a -- an -- a\nspecific intent to harm the unions, that that was not\nsufficient for invoking section 4 of the Clayton Act.\nThe same analysis applies here because what\nIdeal is attempting to do is to use artful pleading as\na way to get around the proximate cause requirement\nthrough their simple assertions that there are no, in\nfact, other competitors within a three-State area and\nthat National was targeting them for competitive harm.\nThey're attempting to evade the normal requirements\nfor proximate cause that look to whether or not the\ndirect injury is suffered by the plaintiff.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, you -- you\nstarted by saying how difficult this would be to prove,\nbut could the plaintiff piggyback on New York? If New\nYork was the defrauded party and taxes are owed to the\nState, has the State had no proceeding in this?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, as the briefs indicate\n-- and we're somewhat outside the record. As the case\ncomes to this Court, it's on the pleadings. But the\nfootnotes in the brief give a little bit of a flavor of\nwhat has happened since then, and there are audit\nproceedings that the State of New York has commenced.\nIt has not commenced any kind of civil or criminal\nproceeding against National, nor has it brought a RICO\naction against National. But there are discussions\nwith the State at the level of the auditors as to\nwhether or not any back tax is owed and, if so, in what\namount.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand correctly\nthat the complaint has since been amended to assert a\nFederal income tax shortfalls?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And as we pointed out in our reply brief,\nthere are in excess of 500,000 corporate income tax\nstatements that are issued by the IRS for underpayment\neach year and in excess of 6 million unemployment\nunderpayment notices sent out. And under Ideal's\ntheory, each of those would be a predicate act for a\nRICO case, asserting treble damages where one\ncompetitor could use the in terrorem effect of a RICO\nclaim simply because of an underpayment of tax notice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but this is a little\nmore focused than that, I think. There's only one\ncompetitor here, isn't there?\nMR. FREDERICK: We have to assume that for\npurposes of this pleading except insofar as it\nacknowledges whether or not a legal requirement is\nsatisfied, and I think that the cases of this Court and\ncertainly the commentators have been clear the Court\ndoes not need to assume a fact for purposes of a legal\nconclusion. As the -- as the footnotes indicate, that\nhas not been borne out by discovery, and there are, in\nfact, multiple competitors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you think it's fair\nto interpret the Second Circuit as having, in effect,\nheld that every competitor of anybody who cheats on his\ntaxes has a RICO claim?\nMR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit held\nwas that if the plaintiff pleads that they were a\ndirect target -- and here, other competitors in the\nmarket like Colonial, Alimar, Friedel, and Easton\nSteel, could plead exactly the same thing that they, in\nfact, were the direct target. And under the Second\nCircuit's test, that would be sufficient to override a\nmotion to dismiss and proceed the parties into\nprotracted discovery. And what the Court in Associated\nGeneral Contracting and in Holmes made clear was that\nthe courts were not designed to be the forums for this\nkind of long, arduous fact-finding mission in order to\ndetermine whether or not indirect injuries should be\ncompensable with treble damages under the RICO statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick, I\nunderstand how your arguments work under section\n1962(c), but how -- how do they work under 1962(a)? It\nseems that that gets around many of the causation and\nreliance arguments that you make.\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the way we\nget to the proximate cause requirement through Holmes\nis through 1964(c)'s use of by reason of a violation of\n1962. We submit that the proximate cause inquiry is\nthe same whether it's a 62(a) violation or a 62(c)\nviolation. And in fact, Ideal has not advanced really\nany argument to the contrary. They sued under 1962(a)\nin order to get a deeper pocket, National, which they\nwould not be able to get under 1962(c). Corporations\nare not persons.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But 62(a) gets to the\nreinvestment of the illicit proceeds in a -- in an\nenterprise, and here you have the opening of the\nfacility right next -- not right next door -- nearby\nthe other facility. And it seems to me all they have\nto show is that the proceeds used for that were\nillicitly procured.\nMR. FREDERICK: They -- that's not their\nallegation, though, in this sense. The theory that\nyour hypothesis is postulating is a money laundering\npredicate act, but they don't assert money laundering\nas the predicate act. They assert fraud. And it's\nexactly the same conduct, the alleged underpayment of\ntaxes that is fraudulently sent to the State of New\nYork, and through that, an indirect injury. So their\ntheory under (a) and under (c) of section 1962\nfactually is exactly the same. The only reason that\nthey brought in an (a) claim is, as I pointed out, to\nget at the pocket with suing National as a corporate\ndefendant.\nBut I would point out here, in further answer\nto your question, Justice Ginsburg, the State of New\nYork, under the Holmes test, is the proper plaintiff\nfor purposes of vindicating the law's purposes, which\nafter all, is to negate the activity of fraud.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any impediment to\nNew York suing him? This would be -- it's kind of strange.\nNew York has its tax scheme. It has penalties for\nfailure to pay tax. And then it could go into the\nFederal court and say RICO is better than our penalties.\nRICO has treble damages.\nMR. FREDERICK: There are cases that have so\nheld, and I think this Court's decision in Pasquantino,\nwhich holds that the tax revenue from a governmental\nentity can be property within the meaning of the fraud\nstatutes, would support a general notion that a State\ncould, in fact, if it believed that that was necessary\nto vindicate the law's purposes would be appropriate.\nOf course, here, the State of New York has got to get\nto that level through a very long series of steps, and\nit hasn't even approached, you know, the initial steps\nin terms of even bringing civil claims against\nNational.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Second Circuit\nseemed to rely on an earlier case that is much featured\nin Respondent's brief, but I don't recall your dealing\nwith it. Is that Commercial Cleaning case of the\nknowingly hiring undocumented aliens and paying them\nless than the minimum wage, which gave that person a\ncompetitive edge over rivals who -- who paid what the\nlaw required?\nMR. FREDERICK: That, Justice Ginsburg, may\ngive rise to certain legal remedies and certain harms,\nbut we submit it would be too indirect for a RICO treble\ndamages claim. There certainly could be an unfair\ncompetition claim under State law, perhaps a tortious\ninterference with business advantage.\nBut the purpose of RICO is not to federalize\nunfair competition law. And this point, we submit is\nvery important because they could not bring a fraud\nclaim under State law. It's not in their complaint,\nbut --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- suppose the\ncompany gets a competitive advantage by engaging in the\nsort of activity that's would be traditionally be\nassociated with organized crime, let's say, extortion\nor labor offenses. Would your causation argument be\nany different in that situation if a competitor filed a\ncivil RICO action?\nMR. FREDERICK: It could, Justice Alito, in\nthis way. Congress has certainly announced, through a\nvariety of statutes, a congressional policy of trying\nto deter and to minimize the use of violence and force\nagainst individuals. And the Hobbs Act is quite\nbroadly worded in the context of robbery and extortion,\ncertainly. The question, though, of whether or not an\nindirectly sustained injury -- in your hypothetical,\nsomething like competitive advantage -- would be\nsustainable -- I think would be looked at through the\nHolmes inquiry whether or not the damages that are\nasserted are too attenuated to be readily ascertained.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand\nyour answer then. I mean -- I mean, does the fact that\n-- that there was classic mob violence involved make a\ndifference or not?\nMR. FREDERICK: It can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I -- your answer\ndidn't -- didn't tell me why.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because if -- depending on\nthe exact facts of how the violence was done, whether\nor not the injury that is sustained is direct within\nthe Holmes factors --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that has nothing to do\nwith violence or not. It has to do with directness or\nnot. You're saying you would apply the same directness\ntest.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, although\nthere is -- Justice Scalia, I don't want -- I don't\nthink that it should be foreclosed that as your opinion\nin Holmes and as footnote 20 of the majority opinion in\nHolmes pointed out, how those proximate cause factors\nget analyzed with the different predicate acts may vary\nslightly, but we think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, may -- may I ask you\nto focus this way, just going one step further than the\nhypo you've got? Let's assume that the -- that the\ndefendant engages in extortion against A and makes a\nlot of money doing it. As a result of that, in -- in\ndealing with B, the defendant, in fact, can -- can\noffer -- offer goods for sale to B's customers at a\nlower price simply because he's getting all this income\nfrom the extortion. In that case, wouldn't your\nanalysis be the same as your analysis in this case?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, it would because there\nis a better defendant A which got extorted for purpose\nof vindicating the extortion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but if that's the\ncase, then -- if -- if the relationship between the\nparties is the same, then the presence of violence or\nnonviolence has nothing to do with your -- your\nposition. Does it?\nMR. FREDERICK: It -- it does in this extent.\nI can't think of a hypothetical, off the top of my\nhead or after some consideration, of where the violence\nwould have been such that there would have been a less\nindirect injury than the one in your hypothetical,\nJustice Souter. But I would not want to foreclose the\npossibility, as this Court did not foreclose in\nfootnote 20 of the Holmes opinion, that there could be\nsuch a case. It's not necessary for us to prevail here\nbecause the mail and wire fraud predicate acts are very\nclose to the securities fraud that this Court\nconsidered in the Holmes case.\nI would acknowledge that in the extortion and\nrobbery and other carjacking and violence type acts,\nthere could be congressional policies that would be\ntaken into account. And certainly the legislative\nhistory of RICO points to a concern that persons would\nbe using violence in a way that would cause harms. But\nI don't think the Court needs to go there in order to\nrule in our favor in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this? I assume\nyou would agree that if the defendant had -- had hired\na thug to go out and beat up his competitor, the\ncompetitor would have a cause of action.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what if the defendant\nbribed a -- an official of the New York revenue\ndepartment to impose unnecessarily high taxes on the\ncompetitor?\nMR. FREDERICK: That is starting to get more\nindirect, but I think that that probably would be\nsufficient to show injury because the State of New York\nis not suffering any kind of property loss or any other\nkind of harm other than honest services.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what if they -- what if\nthey somehow or other fraudulently persuaded the\nrevenue agents of the State to impose higher taxes and\npenalties on the competitor?\nMR. FREDERICK: I -- I don't think that that\nhypothetical in any substantive way is different from\nthe second one, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you think there would be\nrecovery in that scenario.\nMR. FREDERICK: No. I -- I think -- I think\nthat the -- the question of how government behaves, for\npurposes of its discharge of public responsibilities,\nyou know, is treated through a lens that goes to\nwhether or not the law can be properly vindicated\nthere. And I assume that the State of New York has\nvarious laws that can be enforced in a way --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, supposing we've got a\nlicense inspector or somebody every Monday night to go\nout and -- and inspect very heavily the competitor and\ncause all sorts of nuisance values and so forth. But\nhe's a State official, induced to do that by some kind\nof bribery or fraud on the part of the defendant.\nWould there be a cause of action there or not?\nMR. FREDERICK: Not under -- well, I don't\nthink there would be a cause of action by the\ncompetitor under RICO because, again, those damages are\ntoo indirect. That's not very different from the\nAssociated General Contracting case where there were --\nthere was thought to be coercion on the part of the\nassociation against the labor unions, and this Court\nheld that that was insufficient for proximate cause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm rather surprised at your\nanswers because I was thinking you want to draw a\nrather clear line between where fraud is at issue, and\nonly fraud. Proximate cause, case A, the fraud does\nnothing but lowers the cost of the firm; case B, the\nfraud is something that directly is aimed to raise the\ncost of a particular specified competitor. I see a\nclear difference between those two cases, but you\napparently don't.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think, Justice\nBreyer, it depends on how the fraud plays out, and --\nand I would acknowledge that this is a -- a somewhat\nnebulous area when you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it's not nebulous.\nIt's absolutely clear. In the one hand, you are\ntargeting a particular defendant to raise -- a\nparticular competitor to raise his costs. In the other\nhand, you are taking an action that simply lowers your\nown and, therefore, equally will hurt any competitor,\nwhether there's one or a million.\nMR. FREDERICK: The difficulty, Justice\nBreyer, as -- as that series of hypotheticals plays out\nin the real world is that defendants who have to defend\nagainst actions are forced to deal with the truth of\npleadings for purposes of 12(b)(6). And as happened in\nthis case, where the plaintiff can, through artful\npleading, you know, navigate through these series of\nproximate cause issues, can plead facts that courts\nhave to be assuming as true, reach a legal conclusion\nthat there is, in fact, proximate cause --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. If you had my test,\nyou'd win this case.\nMR. FREDERICK: But, Justice Breyer, I guess\nmy point is that I think that there -- with all candor\nto the Court, there are some difficulties in handling\nthat as a pleading matter. And yes, I'll accept the\nwin if that's how that's the Court wants to read the\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I don't want to\ngive you a win --\nMR. FREDERICK: But --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: on a theory that --\nMR. FREDERICK: But -- but I would submit\nthat the rule as articulated is one that would have\nsome administration issues. I think it is certainly an\neasier case where there is a broad-spread competitive\nharm as a result of a lowering of a particular\ncompetitor's costs or a particular defendant's costs\nand one where there is a fraud that is specifically\ndirected at a piece of property for which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- the plaintiff asserts a\nclaim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think the reason\nJustice Breyer's test is a little more administrable\nthan you're willing to admit is that it's not a\nquestion of motive. You're not asking why they did it.\nYou're asking where the predicate act is directed, and\nif the predicate act is directed to lowering the -- the\nfirm's taxes so that it can compete more aggressively,\nthat's one thing. If the -- the predicate act is\ndirected to, you know, blowing up the other firm's\nwarehouse or -- or, you know, something like that, it's\na different matter altogether.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But under the Holmes test, that becomes much\neasier to ascertain because you know where the damages\nare. You don't have to worry about apportioning\ndamages among multiple plaintiffs, and there may not be\na better plaintiff. So I think if you applied the\nHolmes factors in this test here and to the example\nthat you gave, the answer is a fairly straightforward\none.\nIf I could turn to the second point of\nproximate cause that we have raised, it's that as a\nmatter of zone of interest standing, because Ideal is\nnot the defrauded party, they fall outside the zone of\ninterests protected by the fraud statutes. It's been\nwell accepted at common law and through this Court's\nincorporation of common law principles as a means of\ninterpreting the RICO statute, that the predicate act\nshould be viewed in terms of who is designed to be\nprotected.\nHere, because of the allegations of fraud\nagainst the State of New York, the State of New York is\nwithin the zone of interest that the -- of the fraud\nprovisions. Ideal is not. Ideal falls outside the\nzone, and under the way that some courts have viewed\nproximate cause analysis, that would be sufficient.\nThe second large point that I came here to\nargue today was that reliance was improperly analyzed\nby the court below. At common law, reliance is a\nnecessary element of fraud. Ideal, for similar reasons\nto the zone of interest analysis, is not the party that\nrelied on any misrepresentations by my client, National\nand the Anzas. And therefore, it cannot assert a fraud\nclaim because of that absence of reliance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm impressed by one\nof the cases cited in the brief, in which someone\ncauses a person who has a contract with a third party\nto believe that the third party has repudiated the\ncontract, and thereby gets that person to give the\ncontract to himself. Now, in that case, the person\ndefrauded is the other party to the contract, not the\n-- not the third party. And yet, I suspect the third\nparty would -- would be direct enough to be -- to be\nwithin the protected scope, don't you think?\nMR. FREDERICK: I do, Justice Scalia, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And yet, he's not defrauded.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, but common law cases\nhave carved out a very narrow exception where there is\na relationship between the defrauded party and the\nentity that is injured. Usually it's an agency\nrelationship. Sometimes it's a trustee or fiduciary\nrelationship, but that is a very narrow exception that\nwould fall within your hypothetical and would fall\noutside this case because Ideal cannot plead or prove\nany reliance whatsoever on the misrepresentations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But it -- it at\nleast contradicts your assertion that you have to be\nthe defrauded party. You acknowledge that sometimes\nyou don't have to be the defrauded party.\nMR. FREDERICK: Our briefs make that\nconcession clear, I think, Justice Scalia.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\nMr. Roddy.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN P. RODDY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. RODDY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIdeal Steel asks this Court to affirm the\ndecision of the Second Circuit, send this case back for\ntrial in the Southern District of New York. The case\nis ready to be tried. We ask you to do this for four\nreasons.\nFirst, the Second Circuit's decision in this\ncase is consistent with this Court's decisions in\nSedima in 1985 and National Organization for Women in\n1994.\nSecond, the Second Circuit's decision is\nentirely consistent with this Court's decision in\nHolmes in 1992.\nThird, we submit that reliance is not an\nelement of a civil RICO claim based on predicate acts\nof mail and wire fraud.\nBut fourth, if reliance is an element, then\nwe agree with the Solicitor General that reliance by a\nthird party not only suffices under RICO, but sufficed\nat common law. That should be the end of the matter.\nThe decision should be affirmed. The case should go\nback for trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you for relaying --\nrelating the position of the United States -- are you\nrelying on that brief in the Bank of China case that\nwas filed --\nMR. RODDY: I am. Justice Ginsburg, I am. 5\nmonths ago, as you know, when --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- which was kind of\nsaid in passing to say that there was no -- that the --\nthat the court below was right and we shouldn't take\nthe case.\nMR. RODDY: Your Honor, the -- Justice\nGinsburg, the Solicitor General filed its amicus brief\nhere 5 months ago when this Court had accepted the case\nfor review. In its brief, the Solicitor General said\nno fewer than seven times, not just as a passing aside,\nthat third party reliance, what the Solicitor General\ncalled reliance by someone, not only suffices under\nRICO, but sufficed at common law. We agree with the\nSolicitor General's position. Here, we have that\nreliance by a third party, what the Government called\nsomeone, the State of New York.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Being -- is there any\nother case where the defendant is charged with not\npaying tax either to the Federal Government or the\nState? Now you have it both because you --\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you said they haven't\npaid tax for this -- their income -- Federal income tax\neither. This seems to be a novel claim, and I don't\nknow of another where failure to pay tax owed to a\nState or the Federal Government is the basis for a RICO\nclaim.\nMR. RODDY: Justice Ginsburg, as you\ncorrectly pointed out, Ideal's second amended\ncomplaint, which is not before this Court in this\nproceeding, alleged an income tax scheme. And -- and\nJudge Berman in the Southern District of New York\npermitted that amendment.\nI am not aware of another case involving a\ncompetitor bringing a claim on these set of facts.\nHowever, as we pointed out in our brief on the merits,\nthere is a discrete set of RICO cases involving\ncompetitors as plaintiffs who either allege\nmisrepresentations to third parties, whether customers\nor government agencies, bribes, or violence and threats\nof violence.\nI submit to you that this Court's decision in\nNational Organization for Women in 1994 presents a\nvariation on the theme. You will recall that in that\ncase the anti-abortion protestors, the defendants,\nengaged in violence or threats of violence directed at\ncustomers, and the injury was to the health care\nclinics, the plaintiffs. And -- and I wish to say that\n-- that Petitioners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The customers, employees,\nand doctors, as I recall. It was --\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not just customers.\nMR. RODDY: It was.\nPetitioners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there is that kind of\nconnection that -- that your -- your colleague was --\nwas referring to.\nMR. RODDY: Yes. They try to distinguish\nNational Organization for -- for Women in two ways,\nJustice Scalia. First, they say that in National\nOrganization for Women, the potential patients, the\ncustomers, were a constituent part of the -- of the\nhealth clinic's business. That's true here also.\nBut more important, they say in their reply\nbrief that this Court only decided that case on Article\nIII standing. That is not correct. If you look at\nRespondent's brief on the merits filed in that case in\nSeptember 1993, both issues were raised, Article III\nstanding and RICO standing, meaning injury plus\nproximate cause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're getting away from\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But here -- here, the\nintimidation was -- was not directed to your customers.\nI mean, it seems to me that's a -- that's a totally\ndifferent situation. Had -- had your customers been\ndefrauded, that would be a -- your customers, but you\n-- there -- there was nothing directed specifically at\nthe customers of your store.\nMR. RODDY: Certainly -- certainly, Justice\nScalia, there was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was it?\nMR. RODDY: In a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they were just\ncheating the State. What was specifically directed at\nthe customers of your store?\nMR. RODDY: These are inappropriate financial\ninducements. They are offered a lesser price. It's a\n-- it's a -- it's an underbidding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, that's -- that's good,\nnot bad. I mean, you know.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem\nwith your answer to Justice Scalia and -- and a problem\nwhich -- which is bothering you with your case this?\nWe're talking here about two different lines of\ncausation? And each of them, to some degree,\ncontributes to the ultimate result which you claim,\nwhich is a loss of business and -- and business harm.\nOne line of causation is -- is competitive.\nIt's price competition. They charge less. They lure\nthe customers away. The other line of competition is\nfraud on the State of New York which makes it easier\nfor them to engage in price competition.\nSo far as the fraud on the State of New York\nis concerned, its effect on your client's business is\nindirect. In other words, they can defraud New York\nwithout hurting your client. They might simply have\npocketed all the money they saved, but the -- the only\nway that the fraud on New York hurts your client is\nthat it puts them in a better position to engage in the\nsecond line of causation that hurts your client and\nthat is direct price competition.\nIf you accept the fact that there are two\ndifferent lines of causation here, don't we have to\nsay, under the Holmes direct analysis, that so far as\nthe fraud on New York, which is the RICO violation, the\nconsequence is an indirect one, the consequence to your\nclient, but so far as the price competition is\nconcerned, the consequence is a direct one, but price\ncompetition isn't a RICO violation, which leaves us\nsaying, so far as the RICO violation is concerned, it's\nindirect?\nNow, if -- if I have gone astray, tell me\nwhere.\nMR. RODDY: Justice Souter, respectfully I --\nI disagree that the two parts of the -- that the two\nparts of the sphere of the scheme can be broken apart\nlike that. It's one scheme. They have -- the -- the\nPetitioners have to defraud the State of New York.\nThey have to not only mislead the State of New York,\nbut fend off the State of New York, which frees up the\ncash which, as the Chief Justice pointed out, enables\nthem to do two things. First, it enables them to offer\nlower prices, which does competitively injure my\nclient. Second, as we allege in the complaint, in the\namended complaint, they took all those cash proceeds\nand they took them to the Bronx and they opened up a\ncompeting location where they did not previously have\none.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to the\nquestion that I was trying to ask you before with\nrelation to the novelty of this because it involves\nfraud on the -- a government that's a tax assessor and\ncollector? It seems to me that the taxing authorities,\nboth State and Federal, might have some genuine concern\nwith a potential plaintiff's examining to see, gee, has\nmy -- has my rival, my competitor cheated on his or her\ntax. That -- that could be pretty disruptive of the\nState or the Federal Government's administering their\ntax systems.\nMR. RODDY: Justice Ginsburg, I don't see\nthat. That's certainly not true in this case. What I\nbelieve is true in this case is that but for my\nclient's proactive litigation, this never would have\ncome to the taxing authorities' attention. The taxing\nauthorities are free to bring their own case. In our\nbrief on the merits, in fact, we -- we cited one case\nwhere the City of New York suing a different set of\ndefendants over unpaid cigarette taxes.\nThe point I want to make is that let us\nassume that the State of New York intervened in this\ncase, which is always a possibility -- perhaps it's a\nbit late now -- or brought its own case. My clients\nand the State of New York are chasing two different\npiles of money, two separate measures of damages. In\nour brief on the merits, we set forth a hypothetical, a\n$100 cash transaction, to illustrate that. My clients\ncannot recover the lost taxes that were taken from the\nState of New York. The State of New York cannot\nrecover the lost profits that my client suffered. So\nin -- in the Holmes sense, we're not dealing here with\nan apportionment problem because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I wasn't concerned\nabout that problem. I was concerned about people\nsetting themselves up as private enforcers of tax\nliability as kind of a surrogate for the government out\nthere detecting who's violated the tax laws.\nMR. RODDY: Not as a surrogate, Justice\nGinsburg. The -- the fact of the matter is that\nwrongdoers act in a variety of ways.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, you are claiming\na different amount of damages, entirely different.\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'd like to ask you\nsupposing there were two competitors in the market\ninstead of just the one --\nMR. RODDY: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and they did it just to\nget at -- at the competitor A and didn't care about B,\nbut B suffered exactly the same harm, would B have a\ncause of action?\nMR. RODDY: If B could pass through the\nHolmes wicket of causation, Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has exactly the\nsame causation as A, but he just didn't happen to be a\ntarget in the -- in the mind of the defendant. Would\nhe --\nMR. RODDY: The -- the answer -- the answer\nwould be yes. Where I believe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it'd be true if there\nwere 20 competitors too?\nMR. RODDY: Twenty competitors becomes a bit\nmore difficult to get --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why?\nMR. RODDY: -- to get them all through the\nHolmes --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I imagine the damages would\nbe less, but why would it be any different\nanalytically?\nMR. RODDY: Analytically on a motion to\ndismiss, if there were 20, I agree that all should be\n-- if all suffered the exact same competitive injury\nand the set of factors --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then change it one\nother way. Say, instead of defrauding New York, they\ndefrauded the landlord and -- and got a rent-free\noffice space, and that cut down their costs. Would the\ncompetitors have a cause of action then?\nMR. RODDY: Assuming that defrauding the\nlandlord, Justice Stevens, involves predicate acts of\nmail and wire fraud or some other variety --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, it did.\nMR. RODDY: -- of -- of predicate act --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They're sending out thugs\nto beat them up or something like that.\nMR. RODDY: Yes. Then the -- the answer\nwould be yes.\nAnd if you look at -- if you look at the\ncompetitor cases, what I call the competitor cases,\nthere's a very discrete body of law we're talking\nabout. They're cited in our brief. There's fewer than\na dozen cases around the country from the circuit and\ndistrict courts. And what they show is that there's\nonly three ways you -- there's only several ways you\ncan do this. You can -- you can make a\nmisrepresentation to a regulator or to a customer. We\nhave those cases. You can bribe a customer or a\nregulator, or you can engage in violence directed at a\n-- at a regulator or at a customer. There's only three\nvariations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there -- is there any\nlimit on the number of competitors who would have\nstanding? You mentioned cigarette taxes. Suppose one\nnewsstand in New York City is not collecting the\ncigarette tax. Does that mean that everybody else\nwho's selling cigarettes in New York would be able to\nbring a claim?\nMR. RODDY: Justice Alito, we -- we don't\nhave those -- those facts here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I know, but where would\nthe line be drawn?\nMR. RODDY: I don't think it -- every --\nevery competitor in the State of New York could sue\nbecause, as a practical matter, I -- I submit to you\nthat someone who lives in Manhattan is probably not\ngoing to go to Queens to buy their cigarettes. There\nare much --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if they're tax-\nfree they might.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that's the\nwhole point is that the --\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the fraud gives\nhim a competitive advantage not just over the, you know\n-- his -- his brother-in-law's company that he's trying\nto get at, but over everybody who's in the business.\nMR. RODDY: In that factual scenario, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if that's so, then\ngo back for a minute, please, to Justice Souter's\nquestion. It doesn't concern violence. I'm --\ncertainly if violence is involved or a direct action\nagainst an employee or the competitor himself, then\nI'll assume you'd win.\nBut the line I think that he drew very\nclearly and I think Justice Stevens picked up on, as I\nheard it, is a -- a fraud where the person defrauded is\nnot the competitor and the only effect of the fraud is\nto lower the cost of the person who is doing the fraud.\nNow, if that's so, you either draw Justice\nSouter's line or you don't. If you do draw Justice\nSouter's line, then you stay out of the thicket. If\nyou don't, you'll have all the problems that were\nmentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between\none person, two persons, 100 people. There is no way\nto know whether the lower cost of the defrauding person\ndid or did not lead to the shift of sales. There is no\nway to know, indeed, whether it's a rent, in which case\nprices didn't fall, or whether it's actually some kind\nof ability of the competitor -- of the defrauding\nperson to take over the market.\nAll those things that are issue in antitrust\ncases and totally unsolvable are suddenly imported into\nRICO, where if you really want to bring a case, bring\nan antitrust case, and at least people know how to face\nit there. That's -- that's the -- that's the kind of\nclaim -- that's the kind of problem that I think you're\nfacing, and I'd like you to have the chance to respond\nto it.\nMR. RODDY: Yes. Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nThe purpose of the scheme, the purpose of\ndefrauding the State of New York was not just to fend\noff the State of New York, but to free up the cash to\nbe able to offer a price discount. As -- as the Second\nCircuit found, relying on the Commercial Cleaning case,\nwhich we think is very much on point, that is the\nreason why they did it. You can't separate them apart\nlike that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Roddy, I thought that\nthe way you got out of this problem was what your\nopponent has called careful pleading. I thought that\n-- that what you were saying was that your client was\ntargeted, that other competitors were not targeted,\nthat this is something of a family -- both of these\ncompanies are owned by the same family and there's some\nbad blood. Is -- is that part of the background of\nthis?\nMR. RODDY: They say that's part of the\nbackground, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. RODDY: It's not our position.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was part of\nyour complaint that -- that the business here was going\nafter your client in particular.\nMR. RODDY: Yes, that is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And other competitors might\nhave been hurt, but -- but the whole purpose of it was\nto get your client. That is to say, your client was in\nsome special way a target. Wasn't that part of your\ncomplaint?\nMR. RODDY: That is -- that is part of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you abandoning it?\nMR. RODDY: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if -- if you're\nabandoning it --\nMR. RODDY: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- then you're -- then\nyou're in the soup --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- with -- with all --\nMR. RODDY: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you know, all the\ncompetitors are going to be covered. But if you're not\nabandoning it, then -- then -- you know, then maybe we\ncan talk further.\nMR. RODDY: The complaint --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RODDY: Justice Scalia, the amended\ncomplaint alleges that my client, Ideal Steel, was the\ntarget, was the intended victim of this scheme.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what does that mean?\nThen that means you have like the family vendetta\nexception to the RICO --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RODDY: Your Honor, Justice Breyer, they\nraised the family feud. We explained it in a footnote.\nThat's not what this case is about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, you see the\npoint. The point is I don't see how it's administrable\nin a law, particularly in an economic context --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where people who are\ninterested in making money are prepared to say, look,\nwe want to make the money. We'd like to get rid all\nour competitors, and then we start distinguishing\nbetween they'd like to get rid of all of them. No,\nonly five. No, one. And does that make a difference\nin whether you can bring a case or not? I frankly\ndon't see --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or, in -- in other words,\nyour -- your targeted argument doesn't really make\nsense unless there is a family vendetta. I mean, I --\nI want to make money. I don't care --\nMR. RODDY: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which of my competitors\nI'm -- I'm hurting unless I have some special reason to\nget one -- to get one -- one. Now, I thought that was\nyour case.\nMR. RODDY: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But maybe it's not.\nMR. RODDY: -- what is alleged in the amended\ncomplaint is that in the Burroughs of Queens and the\nBronx, these are the only two competitors. Only two.\nThey are head-to-head competitors. We allege in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That is the only\nbasis on which they're targeted. So if there had been\n18 competitors in -- in the Bronx and Queens, then\nthere would have been 18 targets. Right?\nMR. RODDY: Theoretically, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Then we're back in\nthe soup.\nMR. RODDY: Theoretically.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RODDY: Well, Justice Posner, in a case\nwe cited in the footnote, talks about the concept of\nthe intended victim where you blow up -- where the\ndefendant blows up the airplane to kill A and he also\nkills B who's sitting next to him on the plane. That's\nthe EDC case. We allege that the plane, so to speak,\nwas blown up here specifically to get my client.\nThat's the reason why they used the proceeds to open\nthe competing location in the Bronx.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about your client's\nsupplier? If your client -- if Ideal is selling less,\nthen it's going to buy less from its supplier. So\nwould the supplier also have a RICO claim?\nMR. RODDY: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that\nwhen we begin talking about suppliers and creditors and\nbankers and employees, creditors, so to speak, they're\none step removed. They are, respectfully, I believe in\nthe position of SIPC in the Holmes case. We -- we\ndon't have to go to that level in this case.\nCreditors, suppliers -- let's suppose that Ideal\nbecomes insolvent as a result of this scheme. The\ncreditors may step forward and believe that they have a\nRICO claim against the Anzas and National. I believe\nthat they have to pass through the Holmes causation\ntest, and it would be difficult based on the SIPC\nanalysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're -- they're\none more step removed. I don't know if they're one\nstep removed. I mean, if there were no allegations of\nmotive or family feud or targeting and all we know is\nthat there are two competitors there and the one\nunderpaid its taxes, is your case still viable?\nMR. RODDY: Yes. Yes, it is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't depend\non motive or targeting or anything at all. It just\ndepends on the fortuity of there being two competitors\nin a particular area.\nMR. RODDY: The lower Federal courts after\nHolmes have used the target concept and the intent\nconcept to -- to inform, for lack of a better word, the\nHolmes analysis. They -- and the Second Circuit in\nthis case used that as a shorthand to inform one of the\nthree policy factors that this Court set forth in\nHolmes, which I believe was the third factor, which is\nthe proper plaintiff. And the lower Federal courts, in\nthese discrete body of cases involving competitors,\nlike the Second Circuit in Commercial Cleaning, have\nlooked to see whether the plaintiff is an intended\nvictim of the scheme, a target, for lack of a better\nword.\nThis is -- let me -- let me speak about the\nquestion of reliance, if I may. We don't see how\nreliance is an element of a civil RICO claim. It has\nno basis in law. We can't just pull it out of the air.\nIt's not in 1964(c). It's not in 1962, which is the\nsubstantive violation. It's not in 1961, which defines\nracketeering activity and pattern. It's not in the\nmail and wire fraud statutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've cited\nthe Solicitor General's brief --\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- earlier. The\nSolicitor General says it's inherent in the concept of\nproximate cause. In the absence of reliance, you don't\nhave proximate cause.\nMR. RODDY: That -- yes, the Solicitor\nGeneral said that. We happen to disagree with that\npart of it because they don't tell us where the\nreliance requirement comes from either.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where it would come from\nwould be it would be an alternative way of getting to,\nsay, Justice Souter's test, and it couldn't -- I agree\nwith you -- depend upon whether these are within the\nrealm of people who are relying. But suppose you had a\nfraud where nobody had relied. You see, it was really\na failed fraud, and you can get that under Federal law.\nMR. RODDY: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or suppose you have a fraud\nwhere the only party that had relied was the\ngovernment, in which case you don't need them for civil\nRICO. And the strong argument, I think, would be where\nthat's the case, cut it off because of all the indirect\nproblems that Holmes goes into. I'm not -- I'm not\naccepting it. I'm just trying --\nMR. RODDY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to put it in what I think\nof as a strong form.\nMR. RODDY: I understand.\nHere, we -- we clearly allege and the Second\nCircuit found sufficient that there was third party\nreliance, mainly reliance by the New York Department of\nTaxation. That sufficed at common law. We have New\nYork cases going back to the time of the Civil War, the\ntreatise writers, the Restatement, the case from Maine\ninvolving -- that Justice Scalia mentioned involving\nthe ship captain. This has been well settled for --\nfor many years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what is New York\nrelying? I mean, they -- somebody -- does -- does the\nState or the Federal taxpayer rely on everybody who\nfiles a return that they -- they filed it honestly? Is\nthat -- that -- I don't understand the sense in which a\ntaxing authority relies on the return that's been\nfiled.\nMR. RODDY: Justice Ginsburg, I believe the\nlaw is it's either actual reliance or presumptive\nreliance. The taxing authorities actually rely or they\nare presumed to rely on the validity of the -- of the\ntax returns. The fact of the matter is that's what's\nalleged in our amended complaint and that is what the\nfacts are in this case. It is -- and -- and if you\nlook at the Solicitor General's brief in Bank of China,\nthe Government cited this case with approval as an\nexample of an appropriate use of third party reliance.\nAnd -- and I -- I submit to you that, while I\ndisagree with the Solicitor General that reliance is an\nelement whenever mail or wire -- I mean, for example,\nif the predicate acts here involved extortion, a Hobbs\nAct violation, violence in some form, we wouldn't be\nhere talking about reliance. If it involved the\npayment of a bribe, we wouldn't be here talking about\nreliance. What is it about mail fraud and wire fraud\nthat springs from the ground this concept of reliance?\nMy point is I don't believe it has any basis\nin law, and I think this Court should say so. That's\n-- that's why we're here on the question presented. I\nthink that this notion should be swept away because it\nhas no basis in law. It's not in the statute. And\nthis Court has found on several occasions that where\nsomeone seeks to raise a requirement, the organized\ncrime requirement, the prior conviction requirement,\nthis Court has said it's not in the statute. We can't\nengraft it onto the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I -- I find that\nextraordinary that -- I claim to have been defrauded by\nsomebody. He makes a representation to me about the\nvalue of stock. I don't believe it. I really think\nit's ridiculous. Of course, the stock is not worth\nthat. Okay? I buy it anyway, and I can sue even\nthough I didn't believe him?\nMR. RODDY: Under securities fraud, I believe\nthat's different because in this case it's not a --\nwhen you're dealing with competitors, you're not\ndealing with face-to-face misrepresentations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I'm just talking\nabout what the understood requirements of a fraud\naction were at common law. Mail fraud, any kind of\nfraud. Surely there has to be some reliance upon the\nfraud.\nMR. RODDY: At common law, there was a\nreliance requirement. When the mail fraud statute was\nwritten in 1872, it's an amalgamation of various common\nlaw crimes, some of which required reliance, some of\nwhich clearly did not. When we bring the mail fraud\nstatute into RICO, it does not bring with it the\nbaggage of a reliance requirement. And -- and\nsecurities fraud is gone as a predicate act for RICO.\nIt's been gone for 11 years. Where does the reliance\n-- our point is the reliance requirement doesn't come\nfrom anywhere. It -- it's simply being engrafted onto\nthe statute, and it doesn't belong there. That's --\nthat's our position. It must have some basis in law.\nIt doesn't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do you say mail\nfraud does -- does not have with it the normal common\nlaw fraud requirement of reliance?\nMR. RODDY: The case -- the cases are\nuniform, including decisions from this Court, that a\nmail fraud case does not require the element of\nreliance. It doesn't exist in the statute. The --\nit's the same mail fraud statute that's a predicate act\nfor -- for RICO under section 1961.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The place where it comes\nfrom is the idea that if, in fact, you have these\nmonetary crimes, white collar kinds of crimes, money is\nat issue, and no one is hurt. You can proceed against\na person under Federal law --\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where no one is hurt.\nYou catch it in the bud, for example, where no one is\nhurt. You don't want the possible class of plaintiffs\nto spread out into every competitor, into competitors'\nsuppliers. It's a way of cutting off the potential\nclass to people who are closer to any possible injury\nwhere, for example, there really wasn't any injury at\nall. So, I mean, that's the kind of argument being\nmade for it, not that you find the word reliance\nsomewhere in the statute.\nMR. RODDY: But, Justice Breyer, there has to\nbe a place in the law for the three-party scheme.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I just tried to say\nwhere -- where it was. It's a -- it's a way of -- with\nproximate cause, and that's how I think you have to\ndeal with it. You have a case where there was\nreliance.\nMR. RODDY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The government.\nMR. RODDY: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what you'd have to say is\nwhy that's good enough.\nMR. RODDY: I think it is good enough because\nit is -- it is a sufficient way to show causation. It\nis not necessary. It's one way to show causation. I\nagree with you. Third-party reliance is one way. That\nhappens to be the way we will do it here at trial, if\ngiven the opportunity.\nUnless there are no questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: I'd like to return to Justice\nSouter's hypothetical because I think that the point of\nprice competition fits squarely within the Holmes case.\nIf you were to take the fact of bankruptcy, the mere\ngoing bankrupt of the brokers in that case, the -- the\neffect of that on the customers who are attempting to\nbootstrap in the securities fraud fits perfectly here\nbecause the fraud here against the State of New York\nenables National allegedly to engage in price\ncompetition.\nBut as you pointed out in your hypothetical,\nprice competition is not a RICO violation. And using\n1964(c)'s by reason of, the injury has to be by the\nRICO violation. Simply lowering prices or making their\ngoods more economically affordable does not cause -- is\nnot a RICO violation. The -- the RICO violation, if\nthere is one here, is in the fraudulent underpayment of\ntaxes to the State of New York.\nThe SG's brief in the Bank of China case\ndoes, we acknowledge, make the suggestion about\npossible third party reliance, but it does not cite any\ndecision of this Court. It cites two court of appeals\ncases, one of which is the decision below, which we\nargue was wrongly decided.\nThe point that the SG, I think, was making\nwas acknowledging that there are these circumstances,\nand I would advert to my earlier colloquy with Justice\nScalia in which there are limited circumstances in\nwhich a third party can invoke the reliance. But that\nis ordinarily done through a relationship among the\nparties.\nThe breadth of the Respondent's position here\nshould not go uncommented upon. RICO is not an unfair\ncompetition statute. Yet, the answers to the\nhypotheticals about how many competitors would be able\nto bring and whether or not they were directly targeted\nand the cigarette hypothetical all point to the fact\nthat, at bottom, their theory is that any action on the\npart of a defendant that leads to an indirect ability\nto engage in price competition would give rise to a\nRICO claim. And as we point out in our reply brief,\nthere are literally millions -- just on taxes alone,\nmillions -- of submissions by corporations that could\nbe used by competitors if the direct targeting test is\naccepted by this Court as the predicate for a RICO\nclaim. We submit that the floodgates should not be\nopened in that way, particularly given the fact that\nthe difficulties of proving harm and damages are\nespecially present here and that antitrust cases should\nnot be shoehorned under the RICO statute. That is not\nwhat Congress intended.\nFinally, with respect to reliance, this Court\nin Beck v. Prupis held that civil conspiracy principles\nshould be imported into the understanding of what a\ncivil action under RICO should be permitted. And the\ncommon law is well settled that reliance is an element\nthat is appropriate for it to be imported into the mail\nfraud predicate act here because the damages have to be\nshown by some type of relationship between the\ndefrauded party and the defendant.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\n"
