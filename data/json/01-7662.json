        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-7662, Thomas Joe Miller-El v. Janie\nCockrell.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHernandez v. New York described a hypothetical\ncase, a case in which the evidence of racial\ndiscrimination during jury selection was so strong that,\nquote, \"a finding of no discrimination is simply too\nincredible to be accepted.\" This is truly that\nexceptional case, and therefore the Court should use it as\na model, a model of the weight of evidence sufficient to\nrender objectively unreasonable a trial judge's rejection\nof a Batson challenge. Indeed, whatever --\nQUESTION: Well, now you -- you -- Mr. -- Mr.\nWaxman, you've got two presumptions going against you\nhere: the -- the first, the Hernandez presumption that\nthe trial court has to be deferred to, and then the AEDPA\npresumption. So I -- I hope you'll take those into\naccount.\nMR. WAXMAN: I want to embrace them, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: I fully recognize, as an officer of\nthis Court and somebody who has followed this\njurisprudence, that even on direct -- that the deference\nthat is paid to a trial judge in a Batson hearing is so\nstrong that even in Hernandez, this case said on direct\nreview -- and Hernandez made reference to the high\nstandards of proof in habeas -- even on direct review, we\nare going to require proof that a trial court's finding of\nfact in a Batson hearing is erroneous by clear and\nconvincing evidence.\nAnd to that, AEDPA enacted subsection\n2254(d)(2), which says that you -- a writ may not issue\nunless the State court adjudication resulted in a decision\nthat was based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented.\nThere are very good reasons to provide these\ndual levels of deference to the trial judge. The trial\njudge in the case, of course, is the finder of fact, and\nin Hernandez this Court has made clear that the ultimate\nfinding in this case, the finding of whether or not the\ntrial prosecutor engaged in intentional discrimination in\nmaking race the tipping factor, a but-for factor with\nrespect to the strike of any peremptory -- of any juror\nunder a peremptory challenge -- is a factual\ndetermination.\nBut (d)(2) and the clear and convincing evidence\nstandard are there for a reason. They are there for the\ntruly exceptional case in which there are reasons to\nbelieve that the trial judge's findings are deluded, and\nthere are reasons to believe that the evidence suggesting\nthat the trial judge's finding was unreasonable are\noverwhelming.\nAnd I'd like to address the first first and the\nsecond second, because I think it is entirely clear that\ngiven the facts of this case and the way in which the --\nthe trial judge in this case conducted the hearing, that\nwhatever this Court decides, this case is going to stand\nas a benchmark, either that these facts represent an\nextreme that cannot be tolerated or that even these\nextreme facts are tolerable under Batson.\nNow, let me speak first to the trial judge.\nThe trial judge was conscientious and he was, of\ncourse, to some extent disabled by the fact that the trial\nin this case immediately preceded this Court's decision in\nBatson. That is, this is one of these few cases where the\ntrial occurred before Batson, but the case was pending on\ndirect appeal when Batson was decided.\nAnd so we have in this case a trial judge who\nconducted the Batson hearing over 2 years after the jurors\ntestified and after the trial prosecutors gave their\nreasons for all but two of the jurors. And therefore, the\none hallmark of deference, which is that the trial judge\nis a percipient witness of the res gestae, if you will,\ndid not exist in this case. The -- the decided cases\nunder the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reflect\nsignificantly more than a dozen cases decided by this\njudge in that 2-year interim period. He saw thousands of\nvenire members and undoubtedly heard hundreds, if not\nthousands, of Batson explanations.\nAnd moreover, whereas it is true that the trial\njudge observes the demeanor of the witnesses and a\nprosecutor can certainly use as a race-neutral reason\nquestions raised about a juror's fitness or suitability\nbased on demeanor, the objections in this case, with one\nlimited exception, the prosecutor said nothing about the\ndemeanor. The prosecutor's stated objections to the 10 of\nthe 11 African Americans who were struck were substantive\nreasons there on the record.\nIn addition, the trial judge in this case did\nnot --\nQUESTION: Well, but certainly demeanor could\nplay a part in that even though you don't -- you don't say\nit.\nMR. WAXMAN: I --\nQUESTION: You say he's -- he's prejudiced\nagainst the Government and, you know, perhaps the way he\nanswered questions may give you a reason to think that,\nthat the transcript doesn't.\nMR. WAXMAN: I can -- I -- I embrace that, Mr.\nChief Justice. For many years before I entered this line\nof work, I was a trial lawyer and I can remember\nexercising peremptory strikes just because of hesitation.\nMy only limited point here is that unlike many\nvoir dire hearings -- and I've now reviewed many -- there\nwas only one single isolated instance in which the\nprosecutor, in giving his reasons either at the time or in\nthe Batson hearing, said he hesitated or his demeanor led\nme to question it. And so in that one respect, I -- again\nI think this case is more susceptible to meaningful\nappellate review.\nBut I have two more points I think it's very\nimportant for the Court to consider about the way this\ntrial judge conducted this unusual case.\nQUESTION: At -- at what stage, Mr. Waxman? You\nsay this was 2 years after the actual trial? There was a\n-- a State habeas proceeding or something?\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, no. It was direct appeal. The\ncase was tried. There was an immediate appeal taken.\nDuring the -- right after -- I think a month after the\ncase was tried, Batson was decided, and 2 years later, the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals abated -- the Texas Court\nof Criminal Appeals said 10 of 11 African Americans were\nstruck. That raises an inference of discrimination under\nBatson. Remand it for a Batson hearing. And it was at\nthat hearing that the judge made the findings of fact and\nconclusions of law that are reflected in the -- in the\njoint appendix.\nThere was a subsequent habeas proceeding in the\nState courts, but the habeas proceeding didn't deal with\nthe Batson issue because it had been fully exhausted.\nThe trial judge, in evaluating Batson, did not\nlook at the very substantial evidence of pattern and\npractice evidence with respect to what was going on in\nDallas County at this time, evidence that the magistrate\ndeemed appalling. He was told by the State not to look at\nit. He did not consider what the State acknowledges to be\nracially disparate -- disparate questioning of the jurors\nin venire on the question -- their ability to impose a\nminimum sentence --\nQUESTION: How do we know -- how do we know he\ndidn't look at that?\nMR. WAXMAN: We -- we don't know to a certainty\nthat he didn't. He was told by the State that all of that\nevidence was irrelevant. Indeed, the State took the\nposition that a -- that comparative evidence between white\njurors and black jurors was irrelevant. That was the\nground on which they urged this Court to deny the petition\nfor certiorari on direct appeal. All I can say is it's\nnowhere reflected in the district judge's opinion. The --\nthe trial judge's opinion addresses only the six jurors in\nquestion that my predecessor claimed were struck in\nviolation of Batson.\nQUESTION: But he did say, didn't he, when he\nadmitted the -- as you pointed out, when he admitted the\n-- the newspaper article, that he'd take it for what it\nwas worth?\nMR. WAXMAN: He did. And there's an ambiguity,\nand that's why we think, interestingly, that this case is\na (d)(2) case rather than a (d)(1) case. In this Court,\nas opposed to in the State courts, the State of Texas is\nhere before you saying the judge considered everything.\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals considered everything.\nThey don't have to discuss everything that they\nconsidered, and therefore, there is no legal error that\nwas committed. And our submission to you is I don't know\nif that's right or not. It doesn't appear to be right,\nbut whether it's right or not, the result that they\nreached, the conclusion that they made that there was no\n-- that -- that race was not a but for factor with respect\nto not one, not two, but six of these people.\nUnder the record of this case and in light of\nthe way they conducted the jury shuffle in this case,\nwhich cannot be justified on non-racial grounds --\nQUESTION: Before you get to the jury shuffle,\nhow long before the -- the voir dire in this case had the\nnewspaper article surfaced? And there were, I guess, two\nsitting judges who had once been prosecutors and they\nsaid, well, we had a manual that we work with. Could\nthere be an argument that that -- that the last indication\nthat the manual was being used was 5 years before this\ntrial? Or is there evidence that it was being used right\nup to the time of the voir dire? Could you tell me about\nthat?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'll address the newspaper articles\nfirst, I guess you were asking about, and also the manual.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: The newspaper articles -- there\nwere two series of newspaper articles. There were three\narticles that came out in the first or second week of\nMarch which was either just as the 4 or 5 weeks of jury\nselection was closing or after it, but it was before the\ntrial began. And those articles precipitated the -- what\nwas called a Swain challenge but it -- what became a\nSwain-Batson challenge.\nThere were -- there were other articles that\nwere subsequently issued after the -- after the trial in\nthe case but before the direct appeal and the Batson\nremand that looked at the racial percentages in capital\ncases which mirrored the -- in many ways the -- the March\n9th article that examined jury selection in 100 felony\ncases.\nNow, the manual. There were two manuals in the\ncase. One of them, the earlier, more explicit 1963\nmanual, was not offered. It is discussed in the March 9th\nDallas Morning News article which was admitted in evidence\nat the Batson hearing.\nThe other manual, the John Sparling manual --\nMr. Sparling testified. There was testimony in the case\nby Judge Baraka and one other witness -- and it may have\nbeen Mr. Sparling -- that they were not sure when the\nmanual ceased to be used. The Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals in a case called Halliburton concluded that the\nmanual was in use at least through the early 1980's I\nthink or in -- by 1980 or something like --\nQUESTION: And this trial was '85?\nMR. WAXMAN: This trial was '86 I believe.\nBut one of the things that's most striking in\nthe case is -- there's -- there -- it is clear that at\nleast one of the two prosecutors in this case was trained\nby this office at a time when the manual was concededly in\nuse. The other one may have been.\nBut one of the things that I found striking,\njust going through the juror information cards yesterday\nactually in preparing for the oral argument, which appear\nin the joint lodging at pages 54 to 108 -- these are the\njuror cards that people get, the prosecutors and trial\nlawyers get, before voir dire begins. If you look at what\nis noted there, the race and the gender and religion and\nbeards and things like that, there is a remarkable\ncoincidence with the issues and factors that are\nspecifically addressed in the Sparling training manual.\nIt's not our submission that it's proof they were trained\nby it. It's not our submission that they adhered to it or\nthey used it. We're using this pattern and practice\nevidence just as a --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, could I just interrupt to\nask one question? When were those notations put on those\ncards, do you know?\nMR. WAXMAN: The answer must be that they were\nput on at different times. If you look at the notations\nthat say -- the race and the gender notations, each one\nhas it.\nQUESTION: Now, these are --\nMR. WAXMAN: Those had to have been put on\nbefore any questioning occurred because there -- they are\non those cards for jurors that were never reached or were\nnever questioned. There are other notations about answers\nthat appear to be in different handwriting, and I don't\nthink the record shows it at all, but you can infer that\nthey were noted at the same time that the prosecution made\nnotes on the jury questionnaires which are also in the --\nin the joint lodging.\nBut the -- the other point I just want to make\nabout the trial judge is the -- we know -- there's not a\nquestion about whether the trial judge's findings are\nunreasonable in light of the evidence. Finding number 6,\nthe trial judge said there was no disparate examination of\nany venire member.\nWell, in this Court, the State has totally\ndisavowed that. The State acknowledges that when jurors\nwere questioned about their ability to impose the minimum\npunishment for the lesser included offense of murder, they\nused two different scripts. And when they talked about\nthe means of execution, they used a graphic script that\nwent on in detail to explain how somebody is executed in\nTexas, and a regular script that just said, how do you\nfeel about the death penalty? Now, they --\nQUESTION: If we agree -- if we agree with your\nanalysis of number 6, does that suffice to vitiate number\n2?\nMR. WAXMAN: I --\nQUESTION: That the -- that the court finds that\nthe explanations given by the prosecutors in each --\nprosecutor in each case were completely credible.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think it does. The one that\nwe're -- that -- that you have to focus most directly on\nis number 10 --\nQUESTION: That's the conclusion.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- which is the -- the finding,\nwhich is the ultimate finding.\nBut my point is that there are a number of\nfindings that this judge made that are at the very least\nsuspect and one in which the State has completely walked\naway from.\nAnd I want -- I want to spend, if I can, just a\nfew minutes talking about the jury shuffle and the\ndisparate questioning because I've been a trial lawyer for\nmany years, but never tried a case in this system, and it\nwas sort of a little bit confusing to me.\nBut with respect to the disparate questioning,\neach of the prospective jurors was questioned about\nwhether they could impose the minimum punishment if they\nfound that the offense was murder and not capital murder,\nand the minimum punishment being 5 years. And they were\nalso asked about their views about capital punishment.\nNow, some of those people who were asked about\ntheir views about capital punishment were first treated to\na graphic description of how that punishment occurs. And\nsome of the people who were questioned about minimum\npunishment were told in advance the range is 5 years to 99\nyears. Could you do either? And many of them were just\nasked, what do you think the minimum penalty is that you\nwould impose for willful, deliberate, intentional, cold-\nblooded murder where there was no robbery?\nAnd our submission in our principal brief and\nbelow was that the State used those disparities in a\nracially discriminatory manner and that bears tremendously\non the intent of the prosecutor in executing the\nperemptory strikes. And their --\nQUESTION: Are you saying -- are you saying that\nthe prosecutor on voir dire must ask, when he gets to the\nquestion of, you know, how do you feel about -- must ask\nthe same questions to every juror?\nMR. WAXMAN: Not at all. They don't have to ask\nthe same questions. They don't have to ask them in the\nsame way. All that we're saying is that when they do ask\nthe same questions and they ask them in a way which is\nacknowledged to be different and they acknowledge that\nthey --\nQUESTION: Well now, wait a minute. You say\nwhen they do ask the same questions and they ask them in a\nway that's acknowledged to be different, that seems like a\ncontradiction just starting out.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think I -- I managed to confuse\neven myself.\nQUESTION: Good.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: The prosecution -- I believe that\nMs. Bunn will confirm. The prosecution said we had two\ndifferent ways of questioning about these two subjects,\nand we used them deliberately at -- with different jurors\nand we did it in order to remove jurors that we thought\nwere weak on the death penalty. That is the reason that\nthey give and that's the reason against which their\njustification must be judged, and it is --\nQUESTION: You would concede that would be\nlegitimate, that that --\nMR. WAXMAN: Sure, if you -- I -- if you --\nsomebody says, look, I -- there's no way I can impose the\ndeath penalty, and -- as a -- as a prosecutor I don't want\n-- I don't know if I can use a for cause strike, I don't\nwant to use a peremptory, let me see if I can't get them\nto say something that will allow the judge to knock them\nout for cause, that's entirely legitimate.\nThe question is why did they do it. Because it\nwould be illegitimate if they were doing it deliberately\ndisproportionately against black jurors because they were\nblack and it would be legitimate if they were saying,\nokay, you know, people who expressed hesitation about the\ndeath penalty -- we're going to do everything we can to\ntry and get rid of these people for cause.\nAnd let's just look at the State's own\nstatistics. This is their statistics from their brief at\npages 17 and 18 and notes 38 and 39.\nWith respect to minimum punishment, seven of the\neight African American jurors who were questioned about\nminimum punishment were not told in advance that the\nminimum punishment was 5 years. And when they were asked\nwhat they thought minimum punishment was, they said 20\nyears, life. One person said that he thought the death\npenalty was the minimum -- minimum -- punishment.\nFor the whites, 36 white jurors were questioned.\nTwo -- only two were not told that it was 5 years in\nadvance. Now, they say that's not fair because you only\nneed to compare those jurors who had expressed hesitation\nabout the death penalty because that was our factor. And\nthey identify in their brief 10 white jurors and 10 black\njurors who expressed hesitation.\nWell, two things. Okay, we'll use your numbers.\nThat means that of the 10 black jurors who expressed\nhesitation, 7 were given this trick questioning and 2 --\nQUESTION: What was the -- what was the purpose\nof the prosecution in asking about what they thought the\nminimum penalty --\nMR. WAXMAN: Under Texas -- Mr. Chief Justice,\nunder Texas law, that is grounds for disqualification for\ncause and the prosecution did seek --\nQUESTION: What is -- what is --\nMR. WAXMAN: The inability to impose the minimum\npunishment -- to consider the minimum punishment that the\nlaw allows. And they did try and strike two black jurors\nfor inability to impose minimum punishment, however odd\nthat seems given the role of the prosecution in a case.\nThey say there were 10 of each and even taking\n-- 10 hesitant jurors, and even taking their numbers at --\nat their word, that means, nonetheless, that a black\nhesitant juror was three-and-a-half times more likely than\na white to be struck. And it doesn't account for the fact\nthat their 10 white jurors wildly understates the number\nof white jurors who expressed hesitation about the death\npenalty. It doesn't even include a white juror that they\nstruck for cause for inability to impose the death\npenalty, Mr. Sohner. And there are at least 8 or 9 other\njurors that we identify in our papers that are not in\ntheir list of 10. So even if you take their universe at\nits will, blacks were three-and-a-half times more likely\nto be tricked by this minimum punishment ploy than whites.\nNow, on the graphic script about the death\npenalty, they said, you bet, there were some people that\nwe went through all the gory details of how execution\noccurs because we were trying to get those people off the\njury because they were hesitant about the death penalty,\nbut we did it with hesitant white jurors and we did it\nwith hesitant black jurors.\nLet's look at their numbers. Eight of the 15\nAfrican American jurors were given the graphic script, 53\npercent. Three of the 49 white jurors were given the\ngraphic script.\nQUESTION: But might it not be a justification\nthere that more black jurors showed hesitancy about the\ndeath penalty than the white jurors?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it might -- it might be, but\nif couldn't be on this record because there were only 15\nblack jurors. So out of the whole -- I'm using the entire\nuniverse of everyone who was questioned.\nLet's then go to their explanation. They say it\nonly applied to jurors who expressed hesitation about the\ndeath penalty. Let's just look at that universe. There\nwas 10 of -- there were 10 of each. Okay. That means\nthat 7 of the 10 black jurors that they say expressed\nhesitation were given this graphic script, and of the 10\nwhite jurors that say expressed hesitation, 2 were given\nthis. And that to us is evidence of conduct that occurred\nduring voir dire that admits of only a racial explanation\njust as their conduct of the jury shuffle, which is a\nubiquitous and unique Texas practice that exists only in\nthe State of Texas.\nAnd we go through in our brief -- perhaps in as\nnot as much detail as -- as would be appropriate but,\nnonetheless, given the page limits -- and show that the\nState on at least three occasions used the -- its\nprerogative to shuffle the jury for the obvious purpose of\nmoving African American jurors who were in the front of\nthe venire where they would be questioned to the back of\nthe venire each week where they would not.\nAnd here it's important to understand something\nabout the procedure in this case. There was a different\nvenire called every week. Jury selection extended over 5\nweeks. Each week either 40 or 50 new venire members were\nbrought into the courtroom, and they were seated in order.\nAnd as soon as they sat down, the record reflects, the\njudge asked the State first and then the defense whether\nthey wanted to, quote, shuffle the jury.\nQUESTION: What does that mean?\nQUESTION: What does it mean?\nQUESTION: Would you tell us?\nMR. WAXMAN: I will try to tell you and I would\nrespectfully refer you, in case I fail, to the Texas Bar\nJournal article that we cited in our reply brief by a\nprofessor at, I think, the University of Houston which\nexplains this practice.\nBut in Texas, jurors of course are -- venires\nare required to be chosen randomly, but there has always\nbeen a practice -- and it's now codified by statute --\nthat allows the -- the lawyers in the case -- this is in\ncivil and criminal cases -- to look at the venire as it's\narrayed in order and based on what Judge Holcomb explained\nfor the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, based on, quote,\nvisual preference, because they haven't questioned these\njurors at all, the State and then the defense can say we\nwant to reshuffle the order. We don't like the order.\nAnd it is well understood in Texas that the principal\nreason for doing that is race and gender.\nQUESTION: What are the consequences of, quote,\nreshuffling the order?\nMR. WAXMAN: What happens is you take the -- the\njuror cards and it's either done in the central jury room\nor in the courtroom, and they are shuffled either by the\nclerk shuffling the way you would shuffle a deck or, in\nthis case, they were apparently, according to the record,\nput into a metal basket and the lawyer would sort of run\nhis hands around and they'd pick them out, and they would\nthen be in a new order. And after the State exercised its\nshuffle or declined to exercise its shuffle, the defense\ncould choose whether to shuffle or not.\nQUESTION: Are the jurors actually then reseated\nor are they just called in --\nMR. WAXMAN: No. They are reseated so that --\nQUESTION: Everybody gets up and moves and the\nback people get in the front, the front people get in the\nback.\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed. Indeed, and it can be done\nnot once, but twice. And it's particularly critical here\nbecause what the judge --\nQUESTION: What's the consequence? I --\nMR. WAXMAN: Here's the -- here's the\nconsequence. The way the jury was picked here, they\nquestioned -- they questioned between 15 and -- generally\nbetween 15 and 20. One week they got to 30 jurors because\nthey were doing individual voir dire. And so if you were\nnot in the first 15 out of the 50 or certainly in the\nfirst 30 out of the 50, you weren't going to be questioned\nat all. In fact, the judge told them at the outset, that\nif they were -- when the order was finally set, if they\nwere in the last two rows, they could just go home that\nday and never come back.\nAnd so the consequence of shuffling in this case\nwasn't the consequence you'd have if you had 50 jurors\npicked -- this is a capital case. We're going to ask all\nof you -- all of you -- questions, and it's just not that\nconsequential what order you're in. But here the order\nmeant everything. If you could get -- if the -- if the\nprosecution could get the black jurors out of the first 15\nor 20 and into the back, they wouldn't have to worry about\nthe disparate questioning or exercising peremptory\nchallenges. And the -- the record in this case I think --\nit doesn't involve an admission but it is very, very\nstrong evidence.\nI -- I just want to say, before sitting down for\nrebuttal, a point that may be obvious, but it is\nsurpassingly important for this Court to decide the merits\nof the Batson challenge. There are many areas in the law\nin which -- in which this Court delineates the contours of\nconstitutional doctrine by demonstrating what result a\ngiven set of facts yields. And so too Batson's abstract\nrules, its doctrines about the burden of proof and the\nquantum of proof, can also only be demonstrated and\nmeaningfully elucidated by a model. This is the kind of\narea like voluntariness, ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, First Amendment actual malice in which this Court\ncan and, I submit, under (d)(2) must model a case for the\nState courts and the lower Federal courts to show what\nquantum of evidence is sufficient to require a conclusion\nthat a trial court's acceptance of a prosecutor as\nBatson's avowed reasons are objectively unreasonable.\nAnd I'll please reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman.\nMs. Bunn, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA A. BUNN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BUNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nProsecutors in this case exercised their\nperemptory challenges to remove prospective jurors whom\nthey believed were biased against the State, a belief\nbased not on stereotypical assumptions but on the views\nactually expressed by these jurors during voir dire.\nThe trial judge, who observed firsthand the\nentire voir dire process, credited the prosecutors' race-\nneutral, case-related reasons for the strikes. The\njudge's findings of no purposeful discrimination are fully\nsupported by the record and they are entitled to deference\nin this Court.\nQUESTION: Suppose you have a case in which 10\njurors are excused because of their expressed views on the\ndeath penalty, excused by the State. Five of those jurors\nare white and five of those jurors are black. But with\nthe five black jurors, the questioning was qualitatively\nand quantitatively different. It went on much longer with\nmuch more searching, a different script. What result\nthen?\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, I would say that is\ncircumstantial evidence of some kind of disparate\ntreatment. If those are the facts, if these jurors had --\nhad expressed very similar or equivalent views on the\ndeath penalty in their juror questionnaires and then were\ntreated differently by the prosecutors, that would be\ncircumstantial evidence of disparate treatment. It is\nevidence that is not in existence in this case, however.\nFirst, petitioner's attempts to make comparisons\nwith white jurors are not supported by the record. They\ndo not have equivalent views, and in any event, to the\nextent that disparate questioning happened, it was\ncertainly based on the -- the -- either in the case of the\ngraphic script questioning based on the jurors' responses\nto questions on the questionnaires or in the case of the\nminimum punishment question -- questioning on a\ncombination of the responses in the questionnaires and the\nresponses to questioning in the voir dire. So that would\nbe circumstantial evidence, but it is not present in this\ncase.\nQUESTION: But may I ask on that -- that\nquestion that if the different script was based on concern\nabout the person's attitude toward the death penalty,\nwould it not be true, because the script is -- comes very\nearly in the examination, that the doubt about the death\npenalty must either have been shown in the written\nresponse questionnaire or something said right before that\nscript took -- took place?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, that's true and\nthat's supported by the record in this case.\nQUESTION: You think it is, yes.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. Every prospective\njuror who was questioned -- with -- with the exception of\none white juror, every juror questioned in -- with the\ngraphic script at the outset of the questioning had\nexpressed some level of opposition to the death penalty in\ntheir juror questionnaire.\nQUESTION: Ms. Bunn, how do you define --\nQUESTION: Now, the one -- may I just follow\nwith one question? Now, the one juror who said there were\nfour categories of death penalty and he said he was\nsomewhere between one and two, would that have been\nsufficient to justify that kind of script?\nMS. BUNN: Well, perhaps following up with it.\nNow, that particular juror -- I believe you're referring\nto Edwin Rand -- had no -- there was no indication on his\nquestionnaire of opposition to the death penalty. That's\nwhy the prosecutor did not lead off with the graphic\nscript for Mr. Rand. However, after responses like that\nand then the response of Mr. Rand that he didn't know if\nhe could -- maybe today he could impose the death penalty,\nbut tomorrow maybe he couldn't, after that kind of\nquestioning, then the prosecutor did lead up further along\nin the examination with a semi-graphic script, but\ncertainly not at the outset.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: There is -- I think on your numbers\nthere were 10 white venire members and 10 black who\nexpressed, on the questionnaire, hesitancy about the death\npenalty. But of those, there were only two of the white\njurors who got the graphic script and there were I think\neight of the blacks.\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, first off, that's\nnot -- that's not precisely true according to the record.\nWe did list in a footnote 10 white jurors who had, at some\npoint, expressed hesitancy about the death penalty.\nHowever, unfortunately, we do not in a sense have a\ncomplete record because the juror questionnaires of the\nwhite jurors are not in the record in this case. Defense\ncounsel at trial only presented -- offered into the record\nthe juror questionnaires of the African American jurors.\nQUESTION: But you did say that there were that\nnumber 10 --\nMS. BUNN: Who at some point --\nQUESTION: -- of the whites who expressed\nhesitancy.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Who at some\npoint in their examination expressed hesitancy about the\ndeath penalty. But we don't know of those jurors who had\nexpressed hesitation about the death penalty in their\ninitial questionnaire. By example --\nQUESTION: Well, which is something you could\nhave put in I presume, the State could have put in, if --\nif it had thought it had relevant evidence at that point,\nand it didn't. So don't we have to, in effect, make our\njudgment based on the figures that Justice Ginsburg has\njust mentioned?\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, the -- for one\nthing, defense counsel never raised a disparate\nquestioning argument before the trial judge, and that's\nwhere the State would have put that -- that evidence in.\nAnd if -- if defense counsel felt like there were a\ndisparate questioning argument, it would have been defense\ncounsel, given that he had the burden --\nQUESTION: The graphic script and the minimum\npunishment. That never came up before the trial judge?\nMS. BUNN: The defense counsel did not argue at\nall the issue of -- of disparate questioning. The State\n-- the prosecution brought it up as a factor to consider\nand -- and argued, as we have argued here, that the State\ncertainly did use different lines of questioning from\ndifferent jurors based on their views but not on race.\nQUESTION: But if the -- if the prosecution\nbrought it up, it's -- I assume it's there for us to get\ninto it, and we've got to get into it on the record that\nwas made. And if the prosecution didn't make a further\nrecord on that, it's -- it's, it seems to me, appropriate\nfor us to -- to look into the issue on the record that we\nhave. And if we do, we come back to Justice Ginsburg's\nnumbers.\nMS. BUNN: Well, again, Your Honor, the -- the\nrecord in this case doesn't support those numbers also\nbecause we can look to an -- as analogy to the African\nAmerican jurors, several of whom did not express\nhesitation about the death penalty in their initial juror\nquestionnaire but who came back later on in their\nexaminations and did make comments --\nQUESTION: All right. But those --\nQUESTION: I'm getting confused. I thought the\nnumbers we were talking about were your numbers, 10 of\neach.\nMS. BUNN: They were -- they were numbers that\nwe set forth in talking about -- in discussing the\ndisparate questioning, jurors -- white jurors who had at\nsome point expressed hesitancy about the death penalty.\nHowever, to infer from those numbers that it was that\nuniverse of jurors who the -- who the prosecutors had to\nconsider their juror questionnaires in determining whether\nat the outset to -- to use the graphic script, that is not\n-- that is not how we intended the footnote.\nQUESTION: I see. You mean some of that\nreservation of the death penalty may come later in the --\nin the questioning.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, why couldn't the prosecutor\nhave then used the graphic script, or it would have been\ntoo late?\nMS. BUNN: Well, in some instances the\nprosecutor did both with African American and white\njurors, jurors who initially in their juror questionnaires\ndid not indicate any opposition to the death penalty, but\ninto their question -- into their voir dire examination\ndid, and there are instances where the prosecutor did go\ninto the graphic script later on in the examination. But\nthat is not what the petitioner is relying on here. He --\nQUESTION: Why --\nQUESTION: Isn't the fact that we are having\nthis colloquy with you about the significance of the\nnumbers a pretty good argument for the proposition that at\nleast reasonable jurists might disagree about the\nsignificance of it, and therefore there should have been a\n-- a certificate of appeal issued here?\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, given the level of\ndeference that the trial judge's findings were entitled to\nin this case, we do not think that it -- it presents that\nkind of case regardless of the --\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me your argument on\n-- I'm not talking now about the -- the ultimate\nresolution of it which Mr. Waxman addressed. I'm just\naddressing the -- kind of the threshold question of\nwhether there should have been a COA here. And it sounds\nto me as though your argument is saying that unless the\ndefense has got just a slam dunk Batson argument at the\nend of the day, there shouldn't be a COA, which -- which\nperhaps reflects what the -- the court below was doing\nwhen it seemed to -- to say that there wasn't going to be\na COA because at the end of the day, the -- the Batson\nclaim was not meritorious.\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, it is our position\nthat the court -- the court below correctly determined\nthat no COA should issue in this case given the multiple\nlevels of deference that the trial judge's findings were\nentitled to, not only the Hernandez standard --\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't the degree of\ndeference and the significance of that degree of deference\nwith respect to specific claims something that is worthy\nof being determined in the appellate process rather than\nsomething that ought to be determined at the threshold\nbefore the appellate argument has even been made?\nMS. BUNN: Petitioner has -- has never argued\nthat he was not able to make any level of detailed\nargument in this case in the court below.\nQUESTION: Well, regardless of what the\npetitioner may have said, what's the answer to my\nquestion? I mean, aren't you -- aren't we making out a\npretty good case again by our colloquy here for the fact\nthat there was something for the court of appeals to\nconsider here on the -- on the -- the reasonable\ndisagreement among jurists standard?\nMS. BUNN: If the issue were looked at de novo,\nthe issue alone of Batson, then yes, it presents\ncompelling evidence both ways. However, in -- viewed to\nthe scheme of 2254(d), it is, as you referred to, a slam\ndunk case. And petitioner did not meet the COA burden,\nand that is -- our position is that the court -- court\nbelow correctly denied COA given the deference entitled --\nthat -- that the trial judge's findings were entitled to\nin this case.\nAnd getting back to the trial judge's findings,\njust a few things that we disagree with the petitioner\nabout in characterizing the trial judge's handling of this\ncase.\nFirst, the fact that technically the Batson\nhearing was conducted 2 years after the trial, that is\ntrue. However, when you look at the record of voir dire\nin this case, though it was pre-Batson, when defense\ncounsel raised an objection to the strike of an African\nAmerican juror, the prosecution came forward with his\nrace-neutral reasons immediately, contemporaneous --\nQUESTION: But that's not true in every case.\nMS. BUNN: Every case where defense counsel\nobjected to the strike of that particular juror. And that\nis true with every juror challenged here with the\nexception of Mr. Joe Warren.\nQUESTION: Well, for example, the -- Joe\nWarren's case was most interesting to me because the\nprosecutor just exercised the peremptory without any\nexplanation whatsoever. And then the judge made quite a\nspeech to the juror about how he had been a very fine\njuror, and that was sort of the end of it. And then later\non, we find out that he was -- he was not a very fine\njuror.\nMS. BUNN: Again, Your Honor, the -- the trial\njudge -- the trial judge's comments to the juror don't --\ncertainly don't vitiate the prosecutor's reasons for\nstriking him. But nonetheless, defense counsel --\nQUESTION: The prosecutor did not give a reason\nfor striking that juror.\nMS. BUNN: Defense counsel didn't object to the\nstriking -- the prosecutor's striking of that juror.\nCertainly there was nothing even --\nQUESTION: Well, as I understand it, the defense\ncounsel had a kind of a running objection and made clear\nin each record when a black juror was stricken. The\nrecord -- he made it -- that be made part of the record.\nBut he didn't object on a juror-by-juror basis. He didn't\nhave any standing to do that.\nMS. BUNN: He objected --\nQUESTION: Because this was a Swain hearing\nrather than a Batson hearing at the time.\nMS. BUNN: That is true. But he did in this\ncase -- defense counsel did in this case object to the\nstriking of every single African American juror with the\nexception of Joe Warren and Paul Bailey. So he was not\nusing a running objection kind of conduct. He -- he\nspecifically objected to 8 of the 10 African American\njurors struck. And for whatever reason, he did not object\nto the prosecutor striking Joe Warren. While this doesn't\ngive rise to a procedural default, it could, in fact, be\nan indication that defense counsel thought there were\nlegitimate reasons for the prosecutor's strike of Joe\nWarren.\nQUESTION: You were -- you were on the -- the\ntheme of saying that the hearing was conducted properly 2\nyears later, and I don't want to get you off of -- of\nthat. But at -- at some point just answer this question,\nand maybe it's consistent with the two -- the hearing\nyou're about to describe.\nMr. Waxman told us -- and -- and he's fair about\nthese things -- that -- that you've walked away from\nnumber 6, that there was no disparate prosecutorial\nexamination. But you started your argument by -- by\nindicating that the answers were -- were sufficient to --\nto support that. Are you saying that there was disparate\nexamination but that it was justified?\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, that's what we're\nsaying, and that is --\nQUESTION: Because of the answers that they gave\non the questionnaire and -- and answers that they gave\njust before the script was used.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. It's the State's\nposition now --\nQUESTION: So you would say then that you\nhaven't walked away from finding number 6?\nMS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, we have not. It --\nit's the State's position now. It was the State's\nposition at the time of the Batson hearing that any\ndisparate questioning was a legitimate means to deal with\njurors who had expressed different views on different\nissues but was not based on race. And that is consistent\nwith the trial judge's finding.\nQUESTION: So you think that the trial judge,\ntherefore, considered the issue of disparate questioning.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, then the question\nis, if they considered it, did he reach a reasonable\nconclusion?\nWhat about Justice Ginsburg's mentioning there\nwere at least eight white jurors who also expressed\nreservations who were not given this graphic description\nof what the death penalty involves, but instead were just\nasked could you find against a person if that meant the\ndeath penalty? What about those eight people?\nMS. BUNN: Well, again, disparate questioning,\nlike many other pieces of evidence that petitioner is\nrelying on in this case, are circumstantial evidence of --\nof discriminatory motive or can be in a given case.\nAssuming that there -- that there was some level of -- of\ndisparateness, even within those jurors who had expressed\nviews about the death penalty --\nQUESTION: No. The particular thing is what she\nasked and you say right now, I think correctly, that the\ntrial judge did consider disparate questioning. You also\nagree that I guess it was -- the number was approximately\n8 of the 11 black jurors who expressed doubts about the\ndeath penalty were asked this very graphic question, could\nyou find a person guilty and give him the death penalty\nwhere that meant taking him in the gurney, et cetera.\nOnly two white jurors were asked that question. Yet, I\ntake it that you concede that there were at least eight\nother white jurors who also expressed doubts about the\ndeath penalty who were not asked that question.\nMS. BUNN: Well, I do not concede that to the\nextent that it is identifying those jurors as being jurors\nwho expressed doubts about the death penalty in their\njuror questionnaires, and that is the information that the\nprosecutor had to go by.\nQUESTION: All right. So you say there weren't\neight such people. Fine.\nMS. BUNN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. That's your answer.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I have another question which I\nthink is to me more important, which is that these\nambiguous answers, a difficult question about what the\nmotive was of the prosecutor in peremptorily striking when\nhe has a legitimate reason, to decide whether it's\nlegitimate or not, I would have thought history, in terms\nof how the county has behaved in general, would be highly\nrelevant to characterize and decide a difficult question\nlike that.\nBut on page 911 of this record, the magistrate\nmakes pretty clear that he thought history was not\nrelevant in reviewing that third part of Batson, reviewing\nwhat the State did.\nAnd the State court judge himself said on page\n844 I guess whether or not I will give it -- I mean such\nevidence -- any weight is another question, and never\nreferred to it again.\nSo in respect to that, what is your view?\nMS. BUNN: The State's view is that while the\nFederal magistrate -- first I'll address the Federal\nmagistrate's handling of the issue. It is the State's\nposition that the Federal magistrate did err in its\nelucidation of the standard of -- its holding basically\nthat historical evidence is irrelevant at Batson's third\nstep. However, certainly an error by a Federal magistrate\ndoes not entitle a petitioner to habeas corpus relief.\nAnd -- and any error as well was cured when the Fifth\nCircuit considered independently all of the evidence that\npetitioner had presented in his petition.\nMoving on to the trial judge, however, there is\nnothing in the record --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but why -- why isn't\nthis -- you're candid to say that you may have erred on\nthis one regard, but why -- why isn't this a -- a very\nsignificant fact to which we must give great weight,\nespecially you indicated the evidence was circumstantial.\nA little bit odd for a prosecutor to -- to say that\ncircumstantial evidence isn't important. This is all we\nhave in -- in these cases when we're trying to infer\nmotive, and best evidence is often circumstantial. And\nwhy isn't the historical evidence here overwhelming\ncircumstantial evidence and good evidence?\nMS. BUNN: Justice Kennedy, it is evidence. It\nis circumstantial evidence. But the trial judge's inquiry\nand certainly an appellate court's inquiry must begin,\nmust key in on the reasons that the prosecutors struck\nthese jurors and the record in this case. And in this\ncase, prosecutors struck prospective jurors for\nlegitimate, case-related, race-neutral reasons. That's\nwhere the trial judge's analysis began and ended, and it\noverruled the State's objections to the pattern and\npractice evidence on relevancy grounds.\nQUESTION: Ms. Bunn, if -- if it begins and ends\nwith the prosecutor's neutral reasons, then you would\nnever have a successful Batson challenge because the\nprosecutor could always give a neutral reason. And the\nquestion that is troubling me is what in the end did the\ncourt consider and look -- and the -- and the State trial\ncourt said, well, he would take that so-called Swain\nevidence for what it was worth. He never told us. He\nnever said how he resolved the question. And the -- the\nfact finding seemed to be going at these jurors, the black\njurors, against whom peremptories were exercised, one by\none and saying as to each one, there was a neutral reason\ngiven and that's it. We don't know how anything else\nfigured in this package. We don't know whether the judge\nsaid, well, I'll take it -- take the Swain evidence for\nwhat it's worth -- did he say he thought it was worthless?\nHe doesn't tell us. We don't -- we just can't tell from\nthis record what went on at that stage three.\nMS. BUNN: Well, respectfully I disagree. The\ntrial judge found the prosecutor's reasons to be credible,\nand in making that credibility determination and having\noverruled the State's objections to this pattern and\npractice evidence and stating candidly that he didn't know\nwhat weight he was going to give it, given that while it\nis circumstantial evidence, he's got a -- he's got a\nrecord here where the prosecutor's reasons are supported.\nQUESTION: He --\nQUESTION: Well, but the credibility finding,\nwhich is number 2, doesn't prevent us and -- and really\nshouldn't prevent a court from determining whether that\ncredibility finding has a foundation. And if you have\nthis very persuasive historical evidence, the different\nscript, that all bears on whether the credibility finding\ncan -- can withstand scrutiny. You can't just say, well,\nhe concluded credibility and that's always for the trial\njudge and then walk away or, as Justice Ginsburg said,\nyou'll never have a Batson challenge.\nMS. BUNN: We are not --\nQUESTION: Absent a finding that the -- the\nprosecutor is dissembling based on demeanor.\nMS. BUNN: We are certainly not arguing that a\n-- a Batson finding from a trial judge is completely\ninsulated from appellate review. However, in a case such\nas this where the reasons credited by the trial judge are\nsupported by the record, there -- there is no basis to\noverrule the trial judge's credibility determination.\nQUESTION: Well, but that's not true as to\nfinding 6, because he didn't find there was no -- there\nwas justification for disparate questioning. He found\nthere was no disparate questioning. And the record is\nperfectly clear that there was disparate questioning.\nMS. BUNN: However, in the context of the Batson\nhearing that he was resolving, that finding is reasonably\nunderstood as a finding that there was no disparate\nquestioning based on race.\nQUESTION: But if read literally, it's -- if\nread literally, it's clearly incorrect.\nAnd of course, as to the findings on\ncredibility, there's no finding as to any particular\njuror. He just made a -- a gross finding that everybody\n-- I believe everything the prosecutor said. Basically\nthat's what he found.\nMS. BUNN: The finding regarding disparate\nquestioning I believe is phrased as disparate questioning\nof the challenged jurors. So given that, I would say\nthat, yes, that supports the interpretation certainly that\nit was made within the context of the Batson challenge and\nthat the finding was limited to based on race. There was\nno disparate questioning based on race.\nQUESTION: May -- may I ask one question about\nthe procedure? Were the juror information cards that have\nthe notations about sex and -- and race noted on it --\nwhen do you think those notations were made?\nMS. BUNN: I would --\nQUESTION: Because I find it significant there\nare no notations or very few as to attitude toward the\ndeath penalty, which is your -- your key to everything.\nThere doesn't seem to be any card on which the prosecutor\nsaid soft on death or hard on death or anything like that.\nMS. BUNN: I believe that those sorts of\nnotations were made on the juror questionnaires rather\nthan the juror information cards. And I -- I would agree\nwith Mr. Waxman that the record does indicate that those\nnotations were made toward the beginning of the process,\nprior to any individual questioning.\nQUESTION: So that it would be fair to infer\nthat the prosecutor on each juror noted race and sex, but\ndid not note attitude toward death penalty.\nMS. BUNN: Not on the juror -- the juror\ninformation cards. That sort of --\nQUESTION: Which -- which were cards prepared\nbefore the voir dire examination began.\nMS. BUNN: That -- that was all they had to go\non during the preliminary phases. When they received the\n-- after the -- the panel was finally seated, when the\njurors were given the questionnaires, then that's what the\nparties worked from in making more notes in determining\nwhich to challenge for cause and which to strike.\nSo, again, what can be inferred from that I -- I\nthink is -- really, it's -- it's -- there's just not a\nwhole lot --\nQUESTION: Well, if --\nQUESTION: Well, one thing that's clear is they\ndid note the race of every juror before they questioned\nthem. That much is clear.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. So we have -- in essence,\nwe still have a group of three busy judges who are\nreviewing a magistrate reviewing a record. The record is\ncontroversial at best. The magistrate uses the wrong\nstandard concededly. And they don't even issue a\ncertificate of appealability. Well, shouldn't they at\nleast have done that?\nMS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again it is our\nposition that on this record a certificate of\nappealability was not warranted. Again, given the\nmultiple levels of deference, the trial judge's clear\nfindings in this case, and the fact that they are\nsupported by the record. And again --\nQUESTION: But there's some absences in the\nfinding, and let me go back to the -- the judge saying,\nI'll reserve the question whether to give that pattern and\npractice evidence any weight. And then we haven't got a\nclue how he resolved that question.\nMS. BUNN: Well, again --\nQUESTION: Or if he ever even came back to it.\nMS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. However, it was\nclearly before the trial judge. The -- there's nothing in\nthe record to indicate that the trial judge did not\nconsider the evidence, nothing besides the mere absence --\nQUESTION: But he -- he said he was going to\ndecide whether he was going to give it any weight. Maybe\nhe made a decision that he shouldn't give it any weight,\nand maybe that was wrong or right. But we just don't\nknow.\nMS. BUNN: Perhaps he did, but as the fact\nfinder, that was his prerogative, and the -- the record in\nthis case -- again, there's nothing to indicate that he\ndidn't consider the evidence. It was before him and his\nfindings, however, properly do focus on the record in this\ncase, the reasons that the prosecutor came forward with,\nand were credited by the trial judge. And again, the --\nthe record in this case clearly supports those -- those\nfindings.\nAnd these jurors were jurors who the State --\nboth -- both white jurors and African American jurors who\nthe State struck were jurors who had expressed views that\nthe State was uncomfortable with.\nAnd again, to get a feel for what the\nprosecutor's job was in this case, they -- they looked at\nultimately 108 jurors, individually questioned 65 jurors,\nand the prosecutor had to view that -- to view those\njurors as not even just looking at do you believe in the\ndeath penalty, yes or no, but where does this particular\njuror fall in the spectrum. How likely are they to be\nable to consider the full range of punishment in a capital\nmurder case? That was what the prosecutor was charged\nwith in this case.\nAnd if you look at the record in this case, it\nsupports the trial -- the prosecutor's reasons for the\nlegitimate strikes in this case. They were supported by\nthe record. They were case-related. And they were simply\nnot based on race. There is ample support for the trial\njudge's findings and simply no basis to -- to overrule\nthose findings.\nUnless there are any more questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bunn.\nMr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you. I just have six short\nrebuttal points to correct the record.\nThe -- while the graphic script was given at the\nbeginning of the voir dire and therefore based only on the\nquestionnaires, the minimum punishment ploy -- that is,\ntrying to trick jurors about minimum punishment -- was\ndone at the very end, after they had all of the evidence.\nAnd therefore, the relevant universe of whites who\nexpressed hesitation is not 10, as the State says, but 19.\nAnd in any event, even with 10, they are three-and-a-half\ntimes as likely.\nWith -- also, we did -- the trial -- the defense\nlawyers in this case objected over and over and over again\nto trying to trick these black jurors by asking them what\nminimum punishment they would give without expressing the\nnumber. The voir dire is replete with this.\nWith respect to the graphic script, which did\ncome at the beginning, well, the State now says, well, we\ndon't have the questionnaires for all the people, so we\ndon't really know how many there were. We know that we\nused the graphic script with three of them. Okay. The\nthree that they used that they identified are jurors 27,\n59, and 68. Two were excused by agreement, and one,\nnumber 68, was seated.\nBut we do know what the juror questionnaires\nwere -- I'm just doing a -- sort of a quick list on the\nback of my note card here -- for Mr. Vickery, Ms. Mazza,\nMr. Gutierrez, Mr. Hearn, and Mr. Duke. Mazza, who is --\nwho features prominently here and who is not included in\ntheir 10, said in her questionnaire, it depends on the\ncrime.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. --\nMR. WAXMAN: It is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\n"
