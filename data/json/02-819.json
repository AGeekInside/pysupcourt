        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-819, Andrew J. Kontrick v. Robert A. Ryan.\nMr. Poor.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. KING POOR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. POOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case presents a single question: Can the\ndeadline for objecting to a bankruptcy discharge be\naltered by equitable exceptions? To answer that question,\nwe start with the language of the rules. Bankruptcy Rule\n4004 states that an objection to discharge must be filed\nno later than 60 days after the first date set for the\nmeeting of creditors. This rule also allows for an\nextension of the time, but only by motion and only if that\nmotion is filed, quote, before the time expires.\nQUESTION: Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the\nquestion you have raised is not the one that I understood\nthis case to involve. It's not whether the provision\nallows for equitable exceptions, it's whether you\nforfeited that claim, the claim that it does not - whether\nyou forfeited it by letting the thing go past your answer.\nYou didn't raise it in your answer. You let the case go\noff on summary judgment on the merits and remained silent\nuntil after there was an adverse judgment against you. So\nat least in my thinking, the forfeiture question, whether\nyou forfeited, the argument that you would now like us to\ntreat as the question presented, that is the threshold\nquestion.\nMR. POOR: And I - and I would agree with Your\nHonor that the question of waiver, or sometimes referred\nto as forfeiture, is - is part of - that is the question\nthat's before your Court, whether that - the fact that we\nhad not raised it until some later date is something that\ncan be waived or forfeited.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Poor -\nQUESTION: I - I would agree with Justice\nGinsburg that that's the way that the question reads on\nthe petition for writ of certiorari. It's helpful that\nyou did set forth, that the parties did set forth in the\njoint appendix the chronology here. I take it that the\nfirst time your client raised the late filing issue was\nJune 23, 2000, or am I wrong about that?\nMR. POOR: No, Your Honor. We raised it in March\nof 2000 in a motion to reconsider, but we also have\nmaintained -\nQUESTION: Oh, that was in the motion to\nreconsider?\nMR. POOR: Correct, but I would hasten to add\nthat we have steadfastly maintained that we raised it in\nopposition to the motion for summary judgment in that we\nspecifically said that the family account claim was not in\nthe original complaint, and that to be timely, a claim had\nto be in that - that original complaint.\nQUESTION: But in that very pleading you asked\nthe court to strike a number of things in the complaint,\nand yet you did not ask to strike the family account\nclaim.\nMR. POOR: Well, Your Honor, we have maintained\nthat we did and in the context of this -\nQUESTION: But you didn't - did you expressly say\nthat you wanted those certain allegations struck?\nMR. POOR: Well, we did as best we could at the\ntime because this was part of a -\nQUESTION: Did you - did you say, court, strike\nthese allegations?\nMR. POOR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes, the answer is yes?\nMR. POOR: Yes, we believe we - we did, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: And you did not say, strike with\nrespect to this allegation?\nMR. POOR: Not specifically as to that, and\nthat's - and that's what the - what the bankruptcy court\nfound. However, at the time this was part of a mass of\nother allegations, and we felt that we had raised it\nsufficiently by -\nQUESTION: What was your reason for\ndistinguishing the two, for saying strike others, but as\nto this one all that you did was mention that it wasn't in\nthe original complaint?\nMR. POOR: Well, we felt that that was - at the -\nin the opposition we raised the 4004 untimeliness issue.\nThere were just a number of others that were not even in\nthe - any complaint.\nQUESTION: Well, if we're going to get into all\nof that, then they would say there's a relation back and\nnone of those issues are really before.\non the pure question of whether or not, assuming that you\nwere late in objecting that that - that that's a bar.\nMR. POOR: That's correct, Your Honor, and I -\nQUESTION: Mr. Poor, there are cases with which\nI'm sure you're familiar where a statute of limitations\nhas been held to be deemed waived, even though there's\nnothing in the statute itself talking about waiver.\nMR. POOR: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And this is much like that, is it not?\nThere's a provision in the rules for a deadline for making\na claim, but perhaps as in a statute of limitations case,\nit's not an extension of time to find a waiver. It's -\nit's a different concept, and maybe should be viewed much\nlike a waiver of a statute of limitations.\nMR. POOR: Well, in this case, Your Honor, this\ndeadline is very much unlike a classic statute of\nlimitations where you have a, say, a 2-year statute. This\nis different because here the language of the 60 days is\nmodified or altered by Bankruptcy Rule 4 - 9006(b). The\nrulemakers didn't stop with the 60-day deadline. They\nstated that this rule will be incorporated into a special\nsubgroup of other rules that may only be extended, quote,\nto the extent and under the conditions stated.\nQUESTION: But what's your answer to the argument\nthat a waiver is not an extension, it's a waiver? That's\na different kettle of fish.\nMR. POOR: Well, it - any - any attempt to excuse\na late filing, whether it is waiver, equitable estoppel,\nand it could be waiver in the sense of it's an implied\nwaiver where a debtor, by inaction, does not raise it, or\nit could be a situation where there's a stipulation by the\ndebtor to - with the creditor and says, after the deadline\nthe creditor goes to the debtor and says, I want you to\nstipulate to a late time period. In the language here, if\nyou take the plain language of 4004 and 9006(b), that\nplain language simply does not allow for any type of\nequitable exceptions, whether they're deemed to be waiver\nor forfeiture or if -\nQUESTION: But you could make the same argument\nfor an ordinary statute of limitations that doesn't talk\nabout waiver or equitable alteration.\nMR. POOR: You - and that's correct, Your Honor,\nfor an ordinary statute of limitations. This one is\ndifferent for this reason, that the presumption here is\nthat when the drafters adopted 9006, what they did was\nthey patterned it after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n6(b), almost - almost virtually identically, and the\nlanguage of 6(b), on which 9006(b) is patterned, has had a\nlong history of being - had an established meaning as\nsetting jurisdictional deadlines and - for its own\nsubgroup of rules, and those rules, as this Court held in\nthe Robinson case, we must presume that rules that are\nbased on that 6(b) rule are presumed to be - to have the\nsame meaning, that is, in the words of the Robinson case,\nas mandatory and jurisdictional.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think that Rule 4004(a)\nlimits the Court's subject matter jurisdiction?\nMR. POOR: Not in the least, Your Honor, and I\nthink that's a very important distinction in this case,\nbecause I think that's where the court below got off the\ntrail in focusing on the concept of subject matter\njurisdiction. This case does not deal with subject matter\njurisdiction. That's the idea that - whether the court\nhas the competency. We're not saying that the, for\ninstance, the Circuit Court of Cook County was the proper\ncourt to hear this objection.\nIn this case we're talking about an entirely\ndifferent concept, and that is jurisdiction used in the\nsense that a court may not extend a deadline beyond the\nplain meaning of the rule with any type of equitable\nexception, whether it's called -\nQUESTION: Why do you pin the word jurisdiction\non it at all when rules, whether bankruptcy rules or\ncreditor rules, cannot alter or affect the Court's\njurisdiction?\nso whatever it is, it - if it is jurisdiction, then it\nviolates - the rule violates the statute. The rule isn't\npassed by Congress.\nMR. POOR: I - and I - I, Your Honor, and as I\nrecall in Your Honor's concurrence in the Carlisle case,\nyou pointed out that to use the term subject matter\njurisdiction for something like this, for a time\nprescription, is - is anomalous, where in - in this case\nif we're not - we're not dealing with subject matter\njurisdiction, we're talking about jurisdiction as a\nshorthand for a time -\nQUESTION: You're talking about a rigid time\nlimit, a time limit that cannot be extended for good\ncause.\nMR. POOR: Exactly, and I - I know there are a\nnumber of courts that decline to even use the term\njurisdiction, because they think that that's probably not\nthe best term to use. It's used by many courts.\nQUESTION: Could you - could you have, according\nto your analysis of what this animal is, here you made\nyour motion to reconsider after the summary judgment\nmotion was granted, but before judgment was entered -\nMR. POOR: Correct.\nQUESTION: - final judgment was entered.\nSuppose final judgment had been entered.\ncome into the court and say, sorry, court, I forgot to\ntell you that you couldn't enter any judgment here because\nan unalterable time bar had passed?\nMR. POOR: I think, so long as it's within the\nsame proceeding, Your Honor, you could, and that's - that\nwas the holding in the Kirsch case, which the Seventh -\nQUESTION: How about initially on appeal?\nSuppose you - you suffered the adverse judgment in the\nbankruptcy court and then you want to raise that, after\nall, the complaint was untimely, on appeal for the first\ntime?\nMR. POOR: I think that that would probably be a\nrare instance, but I think that in - if it is\njurisdictional or unalterable, then so long as it's within\nthe same proceeding that's just - that is part of what a\njurisdictional rule is.\nQUESTION: Do you have any authority with respect\nto this kind of rule, a rigid time limit, that it's okay\nto untimely bring that to the court's attention? I mean,\nall the precedent that your brief cites are cases where\nthe party who opposes the time extension timely brings up\nthat the complaint was untimely.\nMR. POOR: We have cited a number of those, Your\nHonor, in our - both our opening brief and our reply\nbrief, and I would invite the Court's attention to -\nQUESTION: Where the defendant was untimely -\nthat -\nMR. POOR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - where as here?\nMR. POOR: Yes, and - and even more extreme, a\nmore extreme example, if I would invite the Court's\nattention to the Dollar case, where after the time limit\nhad passed, the creditor went to the debtor and says -\nsaid I want you to extend the time limit, and for whatever\nreason, the debtor said, okay, I'll agree to that, and\nthen they brought that to the bankruptcy court for\napproval and the bankruptcy court said, no, this is a\njurisdictional time limit, you can't have a side deal with\na creditor -\nQUESTION: That was a case where the court made\nan - an initial ruling without having expended any time in\nadjudicating the case. Here, you present the situation\nwhere the court grants a motion for summary judgment and\nthen the debtor says, sorry, court, you never should have\nadjudicated this. We didn't tell you, but now you have to\nerase all - everything that you did.\nMR. POOR: Well -\nQUESTION: I did - was not aware of such a case.\nMR. POOR: Well, there - there are a number of\nthem where they're not raised in the - there's a whole\nspectrum. They're not raised in the answer -\nQUESTION: Raised after the case is adjudicated\non the merits?\nMR. POOR: Yes. The Kirsch case is one case\nwhere it - actually after trial, in Kirsch, the court\nfound that since the rule - and I - it was not alterable\nunder the plain meaning of the twin here, this 4004, 4007,\nthat that could not be altered, even after a trial, and as\nI recall, the Poskanzer case is yet another one of those\nwhere -\nQUESTION: Who made those decision where the -\nMR. POOR: The - the Kirsch case is from the\nbankruptcy court in the Northern District of Illinois, and\n- and the Poskanzer case is from New Jersey and we cite a\nnumber of them in page 16 and in our footnote on that -\nQUESTION: The - the law - like - like the time\nlimit here, the law is unalterable, and if you fail to\nmake a legal argument at the trial level, you're not\nnormally permitted to raise that argument on appeal where\nyou haven't raised the objection below.\nMR. POOR: That -\nQUESTION: The court - the court doesn't say,\nwell, the law is unalterable so you're entitled to - to\nraise this point at any stage in the proceeding. That's -\nthat's just not the way we do things, and that's why we\ndo have this terminology jurisdictional. There is\nsomething special about that, but the mere fact that\nsomething is unalterable certainly doesn't allow you to\nraise it whenever you like.\nMR. POOR: Well, Your Honor, the - to go back to\nthe - the concept of - of waiver or - or forfeiture, if\nthe rule is - is truly jurisdictional, using the shorthand\nthat it cannot be altered, then -\nQUESTION: No, no, no. That was the point of -\nof my question. It is not a synonym for - for the term\njurisdictional that it can't be altered. There are a lot\nof things that - that can't be altered which you're not\nallowed to raise late.\nMR. POOR: But if - if the rule itself, for\ninstance, does not allow a - a debtor and a creditor to\nextend this time line themselves, then it would be, I\nsubmit, anomalous to allow the debtor to do, by inaction,\nwhat the Court could never do on its own or - or permit a\nrule that says that -\nQUESTION: Well, that - that's like saying you\ncannot let the defendant change the law by merely failing\nto raise a legal objection that was fully available. He's\nnot changing the law, he's just forfeited the - that - the\nbenefit of that provision of law.\nMR. POOR: Well, if it can be forfeited, Your\nHonor, then I would submit that it can also be waived. It\ncould be - and -\nQUESTION: What's - what's the citation of that?\nI mean, you refer to Rule 6, and Rule 6 governs a whole\nlot of famous time limits, new trials, 60(b) motions, et\ncetera. So, therefore, there must be a lot of cases where\nthe following thing happened: Somebody made a motion under\nRule 59, or whatever it is, out of time, all right, a day\nlate -\nMR. POOR: A day -\nQUESTION: A day late.\nMR. POOR: Right.\nQUESTION: And then nobody said a word about it.\nThen one year later, for the first time on appeal, the\nother side says, oh, I agree we never said a word about\nthis before so we're raising it now for the first time,\nand the court said, fine, you can raise it for the first\ntime. Now, what are the cases that hold that? I mean,\nI'm not saying there aren't any, I haven't faced this\nbefore, but I would have thought it comes up million - you\nknow, quite a lot of times where people forget to - or\nthey don't care or whatever it is, and they raise\nsomething very late. What are those cases?\nMR. POOR: Well, I - I would invite the Court's\nattention to the cases that we cite on pages 16 and 17,\nsuch as the - the Rinde case, debtor failed to plead -\nQUESTION: No, I'm not talking about bankruptcy.\nI'm talking about Rule 6, ordinary civil cases.\nMR. POOR: Well, I can - I can point the Court to\na case that is in that 6(b) family, in the Criminal Rule\n45(b).\nQUESTION: I'm talking about civil rules of\nprocedure, ordinary civil cases. Probably there are, I\nwould guess conservatively 100,000 cases a year that may\nfall into this category. In a certain percentage of\nthose, the deadlines will be missed -\nMR. POOR: And -\nQUESTION: - and in a certain percentage of that\npercentage, the other side will have said nothing -\nMR. POOR: And -\nQUESTION: - waking up on appeal.\nMR. POOR: And in -\nQUESTION: And then there must be a lot of cases,\nif you're right, that would say, that's okay. I'm just\nrepeating myself because I think there are no cases and I\nthink, to me, that shows you're wrong, but now I'm open to\nhearing that there are a lot or even one.\nMR. POOR: Well, I would - I would invite the\nCourt to the Kirsch case that we cite in our brief.\nQUESTION: Is Kirsch a bankruptcy case? I'm not\ntalking about a bankruptcy case.\nQUESTION: District court - that's a district\ncourt case.\nMR. POOR: In - in Kirsch, the court relied upon\nthat 6(b) analysis in a case called Hulson from the\nSeventh Circuit, where just such a thing happened where\nafter the - after trial the - the party did not - did not\nfile his Rule 59 motion on time and actually the other\nside - they stipulated to an untimely rule - they\nstipulated to it, and then on appeal in that case they -\nthe Seventh Circuit said, we don't care if you stipulated\nto it, it's untimely and you cannot -\nQUESTION: All right, so that would definitely\nsupport you, and what's the name of that case?\nMR. POOR: That's Hulson, H-u-l-s-o-n.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. POOR: And that's - and that was the basis -\nthat was the basis of this whole analysis in the Kirsch\ncase.\nQUESTION: Under your - your view of the law,\ncould the respondent here, the creditor have argued that\nthis amendment relates back to the complaint?\nMR. POOR: Relation back has never been in our -\nQUESTION: Could he - could he have made that\nargument under your view of the law, post-judgment, after\nyou - March 2000, it was decided in 1980 - 90 - 99, March\n2000, you object. At that point, could the creditor say,\noh, well, this relates back, it's okay?\nMR. POOR: He - he could have, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, then what you're\ndoing is you're putting this issue potentially in the\nappellate courts. We don't do that sort of thing. It's -\nit's for the trial judge to say it relates back or not.\nMR. POOR: Well -\nQUESTION: And that's - that's - you put all of\nthe parties in a very difficult position by your rule.\nQUESTION: Didn't the court of appeals said - say\nyou didn't suggest that it related back, therefore,\nthey're assuming it didn't?\nMR. POOR: That's correct, that we - we - we've\nnever argued the - there's never - the relation back issue\nwas never before the Seventh Circuit.\nQUESTION: I'm not saying it is before, but I'm\nsaying under your view, under your framework, it would be\nvery difficult to handle that at such a late point, and\nit's a legitimate argument that they could have made.\nMR. POOR: If they - they raised it on appeal, as\nit might be a - an issue. I think it's probably more\nlikely in the trial court, but yes, I would agree with\nYour Honor on that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Poor, I'm still looking for that\ncase that you cited, because at least the two cases that\nyou relied on principally, Taylor and Carlisle, those were\nboth cases where the untimeliness point was timely raised.\nMR. POOR: That is true, Your Honor, both in\nTaylor and Carlisle it was raised, but I would suggest\nthat in Taylor, if the Court did not allow a late\nextension based upon a bad faith claim of exemption -\nQUESTION: Well, the rule says good faith isn't\nan excuse, so -\nMR. POOR: And -\nQUESTION: But - but you are arguing that an\nuntimely raising of the lack of timeliness is okay, and\nneither Carlisle nor Taylor stand for that proposition.\nMR. POOR: Well, they do in a broader sense, Your\nHonors, that they do not - I would submit that they do not\nallow any kind of equitable -\nQUESTION: They were both cases where the\nobjection to the untimeliness was timely made, right?\nMR. POOR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So then they could not have considered\nthe case such as this one where the objection is untimely\nmade?\nMR. POOR: And that - what that gets - what that\ngets back to our point in our brief that in the Santos\ncase that the Seventh Circuit relied upon most heavily\nhere, they did what I would call a pick and choose of\ndifferent type of equitable exceptions. In -\nQUESTION: I didn't think that forfeiture was an\nequitable exception.\nMR. POOR: Well, in -\nQUESTION: There is a difference between waiver,\nwhich is a conscious act, and forfeiture, which is rule\nthat says, if you don't raise the point, which is the\nordinary consequence of not raising a defense, if you\ndon't raise it and the time to amend passes and you have a\njudgment on the merits, you can't go back to square one\nand said, oh, sorry, I should have put it in my answer,\nbut -\nMR. POOR: Well, our - our biggest point here,\nYour Honor, is that either these rules set time limits\nthat cannot be altered by any type of equitable doctrine,\nbe it forfeiture, waiver, or equitable estoppel, I mean,\neither all of those are in or -\nQUESTION: I didn't think that forfeiture was an\nequitable doctrine.\nMR. POOR: Well, I - I guess in this case we've\nalways talked about waiver as - as what we're talking\nabout here in terms of - it was an implied waiver in terms\nof - it was inaction - inaction by the debtor -\nQUESTION: Well, you're - you're talking about\nthe same thing as implied exceptions to the statute of\nlimitations that, you know, the statute may have run but\nthere are certain exceptions where the thing will still be\nconsidered.\nMR. POOR: That's - that's correct, Your Honor.\nIf - a tolling type, and I think that's what we're getting\nat here is are there tolling-type exceptions to this\nlanguage and I come back - we come back to the point that\nif this rule was designed by the rulemakers to track the\nlanguage of 6(b) and not allow any type of exception,\nwhether it's equitable tolling or - or whatever, then\neither - either all those exceptions come in or they - or\nthey don't, because -\nQUESTION: But - but you cite only - in response\nto Justice Breyer, you cite only one 6(b) case that you're\naware of that applied the principle you're arguing for\nhere, namely that a late-raised objection will - will be\nheard, right?\nQUESTION: It isn't an exception. The point is,\nI think some of us have been pointing out to you, is our\nbelief, which you could try to disabuse us of, that this\nhas nothing to do with exceptions. We'll assume there are\nno exceptions no matter what, but there can be a rule of\nlaw that you win and there are no exceptions, but still,\nbecause you didn't raise the point, you lose it. That has\nnothing to do with exceptions. It has to do with the\nnormal rule, in a court you have to raise a point. Now\nthat's what I'm interested in.\nMR. POOR: And -\nQUESTION: And that's what I wonder - I'm asking\nbecause Rule 6, I think, would be analogous to that and so\nif you - there are some cases -\nMR. POOR: And I would - the Hulson case is an\nexcellent example.\nQUESTION: Which case? Because I'm looking for\nit in your brief.\nMR. POOR: No, it's in the - the Kirsch - the\nKirsch -\nQUESTION: Cited by another case, right?\nMR. POOR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It's cited in Kirsch?\nMR. POOR: Yeah, but - and the - the other point\nI would make, though, is that the - the overall concept\nhere is this case is really no different than the Carlisle\ncase in that if the claimant Carlisle, one day late, or\nthe - the motion one day late could not be extended\nbecause of attorney error -\nQUESTION: But Mr. Poor, it can't be like\nCarlisle because the Government timely made that\nobjection.\nMR. POOR: But the - the question, Your Honor, is\n- I would come back to this: Could the Government waive\nthe - the objection deadline in 45(b)? And I think the\nanswer, and I think this is where this all comes together,\nall of this comes together in this point, is that the\nGovernment could not waive that 45(b) deadline, and that\n45(b) deadline is the same as 6(b) and it's the -\nQUESTION: So you think that case stands for the\nproposition that the Government had said nothing and the\ncourt had said, I considered this, I grant the motion to\nacquit, that the Government could then come in and say, oh\nsorry, we forgot to tell you that this was one day late\nand so you couldn't consider it.\nMR. POOR: If there are - I would submit, Your\nHonor, that if these - if these deadlines are such that\nthey may not be -\nQUESTION: But the - the opinion of this Court\ncertainly doesn't give any basis for that - for such a\njudgment.\nMR. POOR: Well, it dealt with the idea it was\ntheir inherent power to do that, but if - if the Court\nallows a rule that says the Government can waive this or\nthe Government can - if the Government can stipulate to\nit, which is, in effect, a waiver-type argument, then I\nthink that that pretty much unravels Carlisle. If the\nGovernment is able to stipulate to a late - a late time\nperiod by either action or inaction, then I think that\nunravels Carlisle and all these 6(b) family of cases.\nQUESTION: Do you wish to reserve the balance of\nyour time, Mr. Poor?\nMR. POOR: I do, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Figliulo we'll hear from.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FIGLIULO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe best way for me to understand this case is\njust to walk through the case. This is a - an adversary\nproceeding. Rule 4004 deals with the time for filing a\ncomplaint objecting to discharge, and that specifically is\nprovided as an adversary proceeding. Once we move into\nthe realm or the arena of an adversary proceeding, the\nrules are pretty clear. If - if the complaint is late,\nthe plaintiff runs the risk of losing his case if the\ndefense is timely raised, but there's obligations that\nshift to the defendant once we're in the adversary\nproceeding. The defendant has to answer -\nQUESTION: Mr. Figliulo, do you know of any case\nin which an objection could be waived and yet prior to the\ntime of waiver, the parties could not, by stipulation,\neliminate the objection?\nMR. FIGLIULO: There's a - a bankruptcy case that\nholds that, but I don't think - I don't think that's\nright. I think the -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. FIGLIULO: I think you can't agree -\nQUESTION: - that - that holds what? You - you\nthink - you think the parties can waive the limitation of\n- of 4004?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I believe they can, yes.\nQUESTION: The parties, if they get together, can\nwaive it?\nMR. FIGLIULO: Yes, I - I believe they can.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. FIGLIULO: And I think - I think -\nQUESTION: I have trouble - I have trouble with\nthat.\nMR. FIGLIULO: Here - here's - here's -\nQUESTION: I can't imagine that - that you're\nunable to, by stipulation, agree to eliminate it, but you\ncan - one of the parties can nonetheless waive it. That\nthat'd be a very unusual -\nMR. FIGLIULO: I think the statute of limitations\nis a personal defense and -\nQUESTION: It can be waived.\nMR. FIGLIULO: - therefore, it can be waived, and\nthere's tolling agreements that are entered into regularly\n-\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. FIGLIULO: - with respect to statute of\nlimitations -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. FIGLIULO: - and I think it could apply to\n4004(a) as well.\nQUESTION: So you think the what's his case is\nwrong - what was the name of the one that -\nMR. FIGLIULO: I think it was Barley, In re\nBarley, Your Honor. I think that case said that the\nstipulation was not -\nQUESTION: And was that a case in which the - in\nwhich the court expressly addressed the issue and say -\nand said, I'm not going to allow - I'm not going to permit\nthe extension of time?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I think that was.\nQUESTION: That - that's - that's far different\nthan just a waiver.\nMR. FIGLIULO: I do understand.\nQUESTION: There the judges said, you're - we're\nnot going to allow you to delay the processes of this\ncourt, and that's quite different than parties simply\ndoing it on their own without the judges' intervention.\nMR. FIGLIULO: I agree, Your Honor, and the rule,\nlike Rule 6(b) or 9000(6)(b) focuses on motions for\nextension and enlargement and it is strict and it does\nprovide the guidelines for the court to follow, but I -\nQUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying\nnow. You -\nMR. FIGLIULO: Well -\nQUESTION: - you think in Barley, when the\nparties signed an agreement to extend the time limit, the\ncourt should have accepted?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I believe that, yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. FIGLIULO: But I think the court - the reason\nin the court, as I understood it, was that they could not\nagree to do that because extensions and enlargement of\ntime is governed by the rule and that it wasn't permitted\nby the rule. But in this case I think we have a classic\nsituation where we have a limitations period that's the -\nit should have been raised in the answer. It was not\nraised in the answer. It wasn't raised until after the\ncourt granted summary judgment. That's a classic case of\nan implied waiver of a limitations defense and the court\nrecognized that at the bankruptcy level, it's been\nrecognized that way at the district court level, it's been\nrecognized that way by the Seventh Circuit, and it's a, I\nthink, 100 percent right.\nIt's also directly in accord with the background\nprinciples of waiver that apply to a civil-type action.\nQUESTION: Would you agree - do you agree with\nthe Government that if the statute in question, not the\nbankruptcy rule, but at 157(b)(2)(J), if that required\ntimely objection as some other statutes in the bankruptcy\nrealm do, then you would lose, if the statute rather than\nthe rule required timely objection?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I think if the statute provided -\nif Section 157 provided timely, like it does for\nabstention, I think that would make the rules more of an\nexercise of the code and perhaps a stronger basis for\narguing the mandatory strictness of the rules. I do not\nthink it would make it jurisdictional.\nQUESTION: Well, many - many statute of\nlimitations are, of course, enacted by the legislature\nrather than by rule, and nonetheless you have tolling\nthere, do you not?\nMR. FIGLIULO: Exactly, Your Honor. In fact,\ntraditionally, and as this Court has recognized from time\nto time, that statute of limitations, which are phrased in\nmandatory terms, are silent with respect to whether\ncertain exceptions or defenses traditionally apply, but\nregularly apply those, and that would apply particularly\nhere where the bankruptcy court is a court of equity, and\nwaiver is one of those principles.\nQUESTION: In the typical case there's not a\nwhole bunch of people who are hanging on the resolution of\nthis issue. I mean, what's involved here is, I mean, it -\nit says no later than 60 days after the first date set\nfor meeting of creditors. The problem is you have a whole\nbunch of people who don't know what their rights are going\nto be until this matter is settled and it - it seems to me\nthat it's - it's quite reasonable to insist upon\ncompliance with that time limit no matter what, because\nthere are other people's interests involved.\nMR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I don't quarrel with\nthe fact that the time limit is important and it serves a\nvalid purpose, but when we look at waiver - and we're not\ntalking about exceptions to extend time here, we're\nlooking at the defendant's obligation to - to assert a\ntimely objection to the untimeliness of the complaint.\nThat promotes finality because that brings the issue to a\nhead and it - it conserves judicial resources - it does\neverything waivers should do.\nQUESTION: But are you -\nQUESTION: Except - except that it does not lead\nto the conclusion that they should be able voluntarily to\nagree to extend the time period, which - which is a\nposition you support?\nMR. FIGLIULO: It's a position I support but it's\nnot critical to the -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. FIGLIULO: - position that we advocate, but I\ndo think it's right, because I do think -\nQUESTION: Well, would you - would you agree that\na district court could override that determination of the\nparties, say I'm not going to allow the late filing?\nOther - the rights of other persons are involved and the\ndistrict court in the hypothetical case says, I know this\nis not jurisdictional but it is within my control.\nMR. FIGLIULO: I think the - the bankruptcy court\nlevel, that probably would be within the court's\ndiscretion, but I - my view is that it's - it's like a\ntolling agreement and it should be permitted, because a\nstatute of limitations or a limitations period is a\npersonal defense. Now, if there's extraordinary\ncircumstances where the court refuses to enforce the\nagreement, I can't conceive of why that would be\npermitted.\nQUESTION: Isn't the difference between the\nstatute of limitations and the case we've got here that in\nthe statute of limitations case we make the assumption\nthat the only two interested parties are the plaintiff and\nthe defendant, and if they don't care, why should anybody\nelse? In this case, however, there are other interested\nparties and there is a pretty well-articulated\ngovernmental interest in wrapping this up quickly. So it\nseems to me that in - in the bankruptcy case, the court\nwould have every reason, if it was brought to its\nattention, e.g., in the form of a stipulation, to say, no,\nI'm going to keep the ball rolling fast. Isn't that the\ndistinction?\nMR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I think that's a sound\ndistinction. I - I happen to believe that\ndischargeability is a complaint for objecting to\ndischargeability primarily affects the objecting party and\nthe debtor, and while there may be other rights of people\nimplicated, it's still very personal with respect to the\ndebtor and the creditor who's making the objection to\ndischarge. And that would also be even more true with\nrespect to dischargeability of particular debts as in\n4007.\nSo I understand the policy consideration, there\nis a distinction there. I - I've probably bitten off more\nthan I should have with respect to whether that can be\nagreed on or not -\nQUESTION: You don't have to maintain that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Why don't you recognize that -\nMR. FIGLIULO: But I do -\nQUESTION: - that this is simply - the question\nis essentially, where does one draw the line? And one\nmight say, even if the objection to the timeliness isn't\nraised in the initial answer, it could be raised in an\namendment to the answer. It could even be raised in\nopposition to the summary judgment motion. But there\ncomes a point where it's too late to make that objection,\nand that's essentially the question for us: Where do you\ndraw the line when it's too late? Now, it could be on\nappeal, it could be after adjudication on the merits in\nthe trial court. So on that question of where do we draw\nthe line about raising this objection, what is your\nposition?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I know that in this case, once -\nonce the court adjudicates the merits, it is waived, it's\nover, it's too late. I would -\nQUESTION: And that's all you have to maintain to\nprevail here?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I do believe - I do believe that\nwhether there's been an implied waiver or a waiver has\nsome of a fact inquiry that's necessary. It can be as\nearly as the failure to raise it in the answer, but I do\nrecognize the liberal rules of amendment to answers and\nthat may be permitted it by the court in its discretion,\nso it's not a bright line before judgment, it's not bright\nline where you draw the line, in my judgement, but in -\nand certainly once the court rules, it's too late.\nQUESTION: I have one question of bankruptcy\npractice. You just - you can tell me how it works. Is\nthe - is the order for the first meeting of creditors,\nwhich is what triggers the - the time limit here, is -\ndoes that date often fluctuate the - the order of the\nfirst meeting of creditor and then they'll - and then\nthey'll change it?\nMR. FIGLIULO: No, that - it's pretty set, Your\nHonor. That - it can happen, but that's unusual. The\ndate is - the set - there's notice that goes out and it's\na relatively fixed point in time from which these\ndeadlines then are calculated.\nQUESTION: There was a timely complaint filed and\nit is a little odd that it was never argued that, well,\nthis is really within the - within the frame of the\noriginal complaint, so it - it should relate back. Why\ndidn't you argue that?\nMR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, that was argued before\nthe bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court did not\ndiscuss it at all in its opinion. It was argued before\nthe district court. It wasn't discussed by the district\ncourt at all. My client represented himself pro se before\nthe Seventh Circuit. It was not raised in the briefs on\nappeal, so with respect to whether that's an alternative\ngrounds for affirmance, that's been waived, somewhat\nironically, but I think it has been.\nQUESTION: If you're through I'd like to ask you\nan irrelevant question. I don't want to take your time.\nI noticed Judge Schwartz ordered a special hearing on\nsanctions at the end of the proceeding. What happened at\nthat hearing?\nMR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I wasn't involved at\nthat time. My - my understanding is that there was a lot\nof stuff going back and forth and there was a sanction of\nattorneys' fees of $1,000 or $1,500 assessed. That's -\nthat's what my recollection is.\nQUESTION: I gather it was a pretty acrimonious\nproceeding in the district court.\nMR. FIGLIULO: It - it was, Your Honor. It's\nformer partners and we know that -\nQUESTION: Is your view on this as a bankruptcy\nattorney thinking, I mean, I don't see that it affects\nyour client one way or the other, but, I mean, obviously\nthe Solicitor General in this case has suggested an\naffirmance on the very narrow ground that maybe they're\nquite right about what the rule should be interpreted, but\nstill they lost the chance to raise the rule because they\ndidn't raise it. All right, that's a very narrow ground.\nOn the other hand, the split in the circuits is more on\nthe broader question of how absolute are these rules in -\nhow absolute are the deadlines in this particular rule,\nand that's a broader question, which is also a possible\nground for affirmance, so either way your client would\nwin. But, as a bankruptcy lawyer, what's your opinion?\nMR. FIGLIULO: My - and I approach this with\nlittle trepidation, but I believe equitable exceptions,\nthe traditional equitable exceptions of tolling and\nequitable estoppel, continue to apply and should apply to\nRule 4004(a) and 4007. I don't think they've been\nexpressly abrogated. I think they're such a powerful part\n-\nQUESTION: A problem then about the other part\nthat says you can't extend the deadlines in this main part\nexcept for the reasons that are there given, which is good\ncause, et cetera, what do we do about that?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I - I think the - the - Rule\n9006(b) or 6(b), it eliminates excusable neglect as a\ngrounds for extending time for a late-filed motion, but I\ndon't think it eliminates equitable tolling. I think it's\ndifferent. I think tolling and excusable neglect overlap\nsome cases, and to the extent it's excusable neglect, it's\nnot grounds for extension, but a - a true tolling -\nQUESTION: What would be a cause for tolling if\nexcusable neglect is out of it? It seems to me that this\nrule is saying there are no exceptions, period, and to say\nthat even if you can show good cause you don't get it\nextended, but there's some other equitable.\nMR. FIGLIULO: I - it's a relatively - I think\nequitable tolling, in the context of this rule, is\nrelatively narrow exception, it's not - it's little\nbroader than the unique circumstances that relate to if a\nparty's misled by a rule of court. But I do think that it\ncan - there can be circumstances, for example, if a\nclient's lawyer dies right before the deadline is -\npasses, and there's -\nQUESTION: Why isn't that excusable neglect?\nMR. FIGLIULO: I don't think it's neglect. I - I\nthink there's equitable tolling and - and that - that's\nwhy I do think it survives in some way, but I - it's not\ncritical to our position. Our position is waiver. I\nthink we're classically correct. It's approached under\nthe adversary proceeding rules, which engage all the rules\nof civil procedure, which we all know about, it's a\nfamiliar arena, and it should apply as - as it has been\napplied by the lower courts, and I ask that this Court\naffirm it. Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Figliulo.\nMr. Jones, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI have very little to add to what's already been\nsaid because basically what's been said by respondent is\nour view as well, which is that this is a question of\nwaiver, not a question of enlargement or extension of the\ntime to file a timely complaint, and the one thing I do\nwant to add, though, is that the court of appeals, it\nseems to us, correctly pointed out that there is a rules-\nbased answer to the waiver question as well as the general\nprinciples that we have articulated.\nThe rules-based answer is alluded to by\nrespondent, which is the Rule 4004(d) expressly\nincorporates through Part 7 of the bankruptcy code the\npleading requirements of 8(c) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. Now, that means that the - the debtor\nhas an obligation to plead his affirmative defenses at the\nanswer or they would be treated as waived. This was an\naffirmative defense, and so just by applying the rules it\nwas subject to waiver when it was not raised in the\nanswer. We think the court was right in exercising its\ndiscretion to determine that when it's not raised until\nafter the trial, or in this case after summary judgment\nwas entered, it's plainly too late, and it was waived.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, when - at what point in\nthat spectrum would it have been tiled permissible to\nallow it?\nMR. JONES: The broad answer to that question -\nwell, the first answer is, that's not been raised.\nThey've - they've suggested it can't be waived, not that\nthe court abused its discretion. The answer to your\nquestion, though, is that it's - if it would not be too\nlate to amend the answer, then it's not forfeited or\nwaived.\nQUESTION: Well, when is it too late to amend the\nanswer?\nMR. JONES: That's - there's a - a whole body of\nprecedent about that, and as respondent correctly says,\nit's clearly too late once the judgment has been\ndetermined. If -\nQUESTION: Now wait, do you mean judgment is - is\ndetermined, or judgment is entered?\nMR. JONES: In this case judgment was announced\nafter the trial. I - let me back up. I think that it's -\nthe court retains discretion to allow an amendment up to\nthe pre-trial stage. Up to the pre-trial answer, the\ncourt sometimes allows complaints to be amended in its\ndiscretion, and -\nQUESTION: Well, quite frequently, does it not,\nat pre-trial?\nMR. JONES: Not infrequently, but it's also the\ncase that sometimes amendments are denied at that point\nbecause of the particularity, facts of the case. But my\npoint is simply, at this stage of the case it's clearly\nhave been waived and - and -\nQUESTION: Well, now, at this stage of the case,\njudgment had not yet been entered, but the motion for\nsummary judgment had been granted. You - are you saying\nit can never be done at that stage?\nMR. JONES: It would be - I - I think that it -\nit might be not an abusive direction - there's a lot of\nnots there. A court might be able to exercise discretion\nif it thought in the circumstances it was appropriate, but\nit is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial\ncourt, and certainly at that stage it was well within its\ndiscretion, and again, that issue hasn't been presented or\nraised.\nand the reason that it was raised in that fashion is they\nsaid it's jurisdictional. But it's - but they've\nconceded, both in their reply brief and in - and in court\ntoday, that it doesn't affect the subject matter\njurisdiction of the court. And the cases are clear that -\nQUESTION: How do you - how do you reconcile your\nview about the court having such broad discretion with -\nwith the wording of 4004(b), which says that on motion,\nthe court may for cause extend the time, but the motion\nshall be filed before the time has expired? And what\nyou're saying is, well, it really doesn't matter, the\ncourt has discretion to go ahead even though the motion\nwasn't filed before the time has expired.\nMR. JONES: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. The\nquestion that I was answering was whether the court had\ndiscretion to accept the late-raised objection to the late\ncomplaint.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry.\nMR. JONES: And that's a different - and I do\nthink the court has that discretion. Whether it had -\nwould have had discretion to allow a late complaint at\nthat - at some later point really isn't before the Court,\nbecause they haven't claimed that there is any equitable\ngrounds for enlarging or extending the deadline, so that\nquestion isn't presented.\nQUESTION: I don't - you're distinguishing\nbetween granting - I'm sorry - granting -\nMR. JONES: The -\nQUESTION: - granting a late-raised objection and\ngranting a late-filed complaint?\nMR. JONES: Correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. JONES: Under ordinary principles of 8(c) and\nthe Rules of Federal Procedure which are applicable here.\nMy point is that a court could allow the late-raised\ndefense that it - that the complaint was untimely, up to\nsome point it would have discretion to do that, but it\nexercised its discretion not to allow that late-raised\nobjection, late-raised defense in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, the rule on amendment, which the\npleading rules, the Federal rules would apply, says that\nit should be - if after you miss the time limit in which\nyou are allowed to amend as a matter of right, then you\nmay amend - and with the court's permission, and leave\nshall be freely given when justice so requires.\nMR. JONES: That's the discretionary standard and\nI don't - I will be frank, I do not know if there's a case\nthat says that discretion stops at this point. That's not\nbefore the Court.\nexercise such discretion after it had already determined\nthat the judgment should be awarded to one of the parties.\nThat's all I was trying to say.\nQUESTION: At the outset you said there's a text-\nbased or a rule-based -\nMR. JONES: Rule-based.\nQUESTION: And that's 4000(e)?\nMR. JONES: 4004(b).\nQUESTION: 4004(e)?\nMR. JONES: B.\nQUESTION: Where is - where is that?\nMR. JONES: It's at -\nQUESTION: Was that in - did you make that\nargument in your brief?\nMR. JONES: We did not make that argument. The\nrespondent made the argument and the court of appeals made\nthe point. That provision is quoted in footnote 3 of\nrespondent's brief. It's a very short provision. It just\nsays that the - the procedures of Part 7 will have\ngoverned, and then Rule 7008 says that incorporates Rule\n8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nNow, we have not addressed the question of\nwhether equitable exceptions would be available under this\nrule, but we do think that the Court's decision in the\nSantos case provides a sensible explanation of how to\naddress that question. In Santos, the Court made the\npoint that the rules appear to say you cannot extend by\nexcusable neglect, but that doesn't preclude equitable\nestoppel, because estoppel is based on the misconduct of\nthe debtor, excusable neglect is the neglect of the\ncreditor. So not allowing an extension for neglect\ndoesn't preclude allowing an extension for estoppel.\nQUESTION: So you think this is a totally\ndifferent issue and it's a much broader issue and more\nimportant -\nMR. JONES: This is a much - this is -\nQUESTION: And you think, in other words, if they\nhad come in and said, hey, we - I've been taking all the\nmoney out of wife's account, putting - put it in - you\nknow, I put it all in her name, ha ha ha, and I had hired\npeople to prevent the creditor from ever finding out, that\nthen the correct defense there would be equitable\nestoppel, which is an enlargement of the time period?\nMR. JONES: If the - if I understood your\nhypothetical, if the basis of the estoppel was that -\nQUESTION: I'm - I'm assuming they acted very\ninequitably.\nMR. JONES: - that we were unable to find - they\nhid from us what they were doing -\nQUESTION: Yes, yes.\nMR. JONES: - yes, I think that would apply. But\nI should also point out that in that specific factual\nscenario, 727(d) of the bankruptcy code would allow the\ndischarge to be reopened in -\nQUESTION: You see, that - that's the argument\nthe other way. The argument the other way is you don't\nreally need to import these defenses into the rule itself\nbecause there are other ways in the bankruptcy law that an\nunfair kind of conduct that can be dealt with.\nMR. JONES: If, to the extent that there are\nother ways to deal with it, then equity doesn't need to\nstep in if there's an adequate legal remedy. But if -\nwhen there's not an adequate answer in the code to this -\nto whatever facts come up about the estoppel situation,\nwe would think that the rules don't preclude the court -\nQUESTION: Mr. Kent, as I remember the - this\ncase itself, the debtor was never secretive about what he\nhad done. He told the creditors, he told everybody, yeah,\nI took my name off the account -\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: - but I continued to deposit my salary\nin it, I continued to pay the family expenses from it. It\nwasn't concealed.\nMR. JONES: It's a hypothetical -\nQUESTION: It's a hypothetical case. I'm trying\nto get to the issue the - that's bothering me. Can you\njust give me one word about whether my belief about the\nRule 6 - it refers to a new trial motion in a civil case,\nmotion to amend the opinion, JNOV, all those time limits\nit says are absolute. Now, I take it it's never been held\nor isn't at least normally held that a lawyer can sit\nthere, notice that the time limits weren't complied with,\nwait to see if he wins, and then if he loses, bring it up\nfor the first time on appeal. Am I right about that?\nBecause they're saying, no, I'm not right about it.\nMR. JONES: Well, I - I think you're right about\nthat that you can waive an argument of any - based on\nthose rules in - in the trial court, but let me -\nQUESTION: Is it - do you know of any case, Mr.\nKent, because those are all motions that are brought after\nthe trial, after the adjudication, and I can't imagine a\nscenario where a lawyer who won would then - and the other\nparty moves for a new trial - would then say nothing.\nMR. JONES: I'm not familiar with a case of that\ntype, but there - I can imagine that there's a case out\nthere that says something along the following, that this\nCourt's jurisdiction, by statute, is based on the\nrequirement, for example, that there be a notice of appeal\nfiled within 30 days.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\nMr. Poor, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. KING POOR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. POOR: I'd like to return to the - the\nfundamental point is when these were adopted, 9006(b) was\npatterned after 6(b), and that identical language, as this\nCourt instructed in the Robinson case, should be read to\nbe mandatory and jurisdictional, that is, not waiveable.\nAnd if we look at a case like Santos, there's nothing in\nthe language that allows Santos to pick and choose between\n- between saying equitable estoppel would - would not\napply but waiver would apply. The only possible way you\ncan get there in Santos is not through the text, not\nthrough the language, which Robinson has told us is\nmandatory and jurisdictional. The only way you can get\nthere is through the - a policy argument that says, we\nthink it's a good idea not to have equitable estoppel, but\non the other hand, yeah, for policy reasons, we - we\nshould allow waiver to apply.\nAnd if you allow waiver, whether it is waiver in\nthe implied sense of inaction or waiver in the express\nsense of allowing a stipulation, in that case, you will\nhave really taken what is in the text and these are no\nlonger jurisdictional rules without exception. Rather,\nthey have become rules that the parties themselves may\nchange, and this deadline has never been like a statute of\nlimitations. It has always been different. It allows the\nparties to, before there's any - before there's any\nadjudication, any deadline, to take discovery and move the\ndeadline along. That's not like a typical statute of\nlimitation, and the reason for that is the text. The text\nsays it may only be extended to the extent and under the\nconditions stated, the exact language that was at issue in\nCarlisle and in Robinson, and we would submit that you\nhave to read the same language in the same way, whether\nit's 9006(b), 6(b), Criminal Rule 45(b), they all are\nbased on the same language.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Poor.\n"
