        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-1809, J. Elliott Hibbs v. Kathleen Winn.\nVery well, General Goddard. You may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GODDARD: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe fundamental -- the fundamental question in\nthis case is whether the meaning of the term assessment,\nas used in the Tax Injunction Act, includes Arizona's\nschool tax credit.\nAs this Court has written on several occasions,\nthe Tax Injunction Act has a very broad reach. It\ndrastically limits the access to Federal district courts.\nThe act is relatively simple and -- and straightforward.\nIt's just 35 words, as I count it, and it specifically\nsays the Federal district courts shall not enjoin,\nrestrain, or suspend the assessment, levy, or collection\nof a tax under State law where there is a plain, speedy,\nand efficient remedy in the courts of that State.\nQUESTION: Where is the assessment here that --\nthat supposedly is being enjoined?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, the assessment is the\ncalculation of a tax by the -- for the taxpayer. In other\nwords, it's the bottom line. It's the plain meaning of\nassessment and the dictionary meaning. It is what happens\nafter you've done all the additions and subtractions and\nyou get to line 40 on the Arizona tax return form which\nis --\nQUESTION: It's -- it's a self-assessment? So\nyou -- it's a self-assessment that's being enjoined?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I'm not talking about\na self-assessment. I believe a self-assessment is a\ncolloquialism that talks about what all of us go through\nas taxpayers. The assessment I'm talking about is what\nthe defendant in this case, Elliott Hibbs, the Director of\nthe Department of Revenue in Arizona, does both for\nindividual taxpayers and for all the taxpayers\ncollectively to determine what the State's revenues are\ngoing to be from the taxpayers. And the only way you get\nto the revenue is that bottom line on the tax form --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goddard --\nMR. GODDARD: -- after you've done all the\ncredits.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goddard, I thought that in a\nself-assessment system, such as the one we have, the\nFederal Government, Arizona, that assessment is associated\nwith assertion of a deficiency. In Arizona, is every\ntaxpayer assessed by the government? That would be quite\na different system, wouldn't it?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, every taxpayer in\nArizona has their form calculated by the government. We\ncheck the math.\nQUESTION: You -- you audit everyone in the\nState?\nMR. GODDARD: No, Your Honor. I'm not trying to\nsay we audit everyone, but technically the assessment, and\nas it is used also in the Internal Revenue Code to my\nunderstanding, is the assessment -- and I'm quoting from\nthe Internal Revenue Code -- shall be made by recording\nthe liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the\nSecretary.\nQUESTION: Which the Government does when it\nwants to assert a deficiency. And we were told that the\nassessment just a week ago is nothing more than a\nbookkeeping entry, and what it does is it triggers certain\nadministrative remedies. But my understanding was that an\nassessment is made when the Government wants to assert a\ndeficiency. Otherwise, there isn't this entry, this\nbookkeeping entry someplace, that every taxpayer isn't\nassessed.\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, it is -- it is our\nposition that the State of Arizona under our State tax\nsystem assesses all taxes in the State and that --\nQUESTION: When -- when does that happen? When\nthe return is received in the office or?\nMR. GODDARD: It -- it returns during -- excuse\nme. Your Honor, the -- the activity perhaps is -- is\nsomewhat fictional in terms of the -- of the director.\nHe's not going to sit down, as in the old days, with a\ngreen eyeshade and write down a number for each taxpayer.\nBut he does, in fact, and his office does, in fact,\ncalculate the gross revenues in the State, what credits\nare going to be applied against those gross revenues,\nvarious adjustments, and comes up with a bottom line. And\nthat bottom line is our dictionary -- Black's Dictionary\ndefinition of what an assessment is.\nQUESTION: But that's not the assessment that\nyou -- I mean, you used the Internal Revenue Code\nprovision. That is an entry. We were told it's a\nbookkeeping entry. And it's made as a prerequisite to\nlevying liens, to extending the statute of limitations.\nBut it certainly isn't true that that kind of assessment,\nwhich is what your brief suggested you were talking about,\nis made in the case of every taxpayer.\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I'm not saying that\nevery taxpayer has a -- a specific entry next to their\nname. That would -- that would certainly be more than we\ncould do. But our statutes, our tax system in Arizona\ndoes, in fact, call for an assessment of the liability of\neach taxpayer. And that assessment, the entire plan,\nscheme fixed upon for charging and taxing, the Webster's\ndefinition of assessment, is the bottom line. And I guess\nthat's the plain meaning that I'm trying to get to.\nQUESTION: Because I -- I assume that assessment\nis -- is -- the assessment that we're concerned with is --\nis within the meaning of Federal law.\nBut let me just ask you this question. Do you\nhave a statute in Arizona that in effect says what the\ndepartment does with respect to each taxpayer is to assess\nthat taxpayer? Does -- does that word occur as a\nstatement for some technical function that you go through\nwith respect to every taxpayer within the meaning of\nArizona law?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I -- I can't say that\nwe have that specific word in our statute. We\ncertainly --\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then isn't your problem\nthis, that -- that there -- that that specific word is\nused in the Federal statutes, quite apart from the Tax\nInjunction Act? And -- and my understanding is the same\nas Justice Ginsburg's. It is used in -- in a way that --\nthat involves a -- a predicate to the -- the assertion of\na lien or -- or steps to collect a deficiency. And -- and\nthat doesn't seem to be what is involved here. Isn't --\nisn't that a problem for you in your position?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I don't believe so\nbecause the -- the first step -- and -- and the three\nwords in the statute I think are -- are certainly helpful:\nassessment, levy, collection. What essentially the\nCongress --\nQUESTION: Well, there's no issue of a levy\ngoing on here, and they're not trying to stop you from\ncollecting anything. I mean, their -- their argument is\nyou ought to be collecting more, but they're certainly not\ninterfering in a way that's going to leave Arizona without\nmoney while it litigates.\nto litigate so that you'll get more money, and -- and so\nthat I suppose that's why the Ninth Circuit said why --\nthat the closest thing to a word involved here that --\nthat might let the statute apply is assessment.\nMR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor, we believe\nthat --\nQUESTION: And it didn't think it did. But, I\nmean, it seems to me that that's a basic textual problem\nin -- in your case, and I don't understand how you get\naround it.\nQUESTION: The technical assessment that's made\ntied to a deficiency you don't fit. So you're talking\nabout some other kind of assessment than the one that, for\nexample, the Government was telling us about last Monday\nin the Galletti case, not that technical -- some -- if\nwe're talking about property, say, a property tax, then\nmaybe an assessor comes on the land, looks at the house,\nattributes a value to it. That wouldn't be a self-\nassessing system from the taxpayer's point of view. But\n-- but the income tax is quite different. You assess\nyourself. Sometimes you get audited; sometimes you don't.\nAnd I don't see that anybody here is trying to\nstop the government from making the assessment that would\nbe a trigger to asserting a deficiency. No one is trying\nto stop Arizona from asserting a deficiency against any\ntaxpayer.\nMR. GODDARD: No, Your Honor, but -- but what\nwe're asking for is that the -- the director, Mr. Hibbs,\nbe able to -- as the statute says, to implement the -- the\ntax system under State law.\nQUESTION: Well, is it the case, though, that\nother courts of appeal at the Federal level have concluded\nthat the Tax Injunction Act does not bar suits that would\nincrease State revenues rather than reduce them, that the\npurpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to prevent reduction\nof State tax revenues, specifically by corporations coming\nin and getting injunctions and preventing the State from\nreceiving revenues, but that it doesn't apply where the\neffect of the -- the suit would be to increase the State's\ncoffers?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, if I could deal with\n-- there -- there are two questions, one, the legislative\nhistory and -- and the -- as this Court has noted --\nQUESTION: First of all, with the courts of\nappeal, the majority have so held, I guess, who have\naddressed it.\nMR. GODDARD: No, Your Honor. I -- I would\nsubmit that -- that that's not the case.\nQUESTION: Only the Fifth Circuit has gone the\nother way.\nMR. GODDARD: The Fifth Circuit in ACLU\nFoundation v. Bridges has -- has very convincingly --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the others went the other\nway on it.\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I could --\nQUESTION: The Seventh, the Eighth, and the\nNinth. Right?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, there is -- is\nlanguage in the Seventh Circuit opinion which speaks about\nthis, but it is in a very limited sense in -- in Dunn v.\nKerry. I don't think it's applicable here. I'd be happy\nto discuss that.\nI would refer the course also -- the Court also,\nas our brief does, to First Circuit U.S. Brewers v. Perez\ninterpreting the Butler Act which is identical in language\nto the Tax Injunction Act; to Kraebel v. New York Housing\nDepartment in the Second Circuit which talks about a tax\nbenefit.\nThat's what we have on -- at -- at stake here is\nwe try -- the -- the respondents are trying to draw a\ndivision between all State tax systems to say anything\nthat involves raising revenue is challengeable only in\nState court, but if there's a benefit involved, if there's\nanything else that accrues to the benefit of the taxpayer,\nthat has to go Federal court. I believe that's --\nQUESTION: I don't know about that, but a -- a\nchallenge to a tax credit I think is what we're talking\nabout. Right?\nMR. GODDARD: Well, Your Honor, I don't believe\nthere's any logical distinction between a deduction, an\nexclusion, an exemption, and a credit. They all --\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose you could -- I\nsuppose you could make the argument that it -- it's wrong\nto say the State is only interested in increasing revenue.\nThe State may be interested in fairness for its taxpayers,\ngiving its taxpayers the -- the benefit of the lower rate.\nThat's certainly a -- a sound State policy.\nMR. GODDARD: Thank you, Your Honor. I -- I\nthink that's one of the policies, if not the principal\npolicy, behind the Tax Injunction Act is respect for State\nprocedures and also --\nQUESTION: General Goddard, the -- what we've\nbeen talking about is this section of 1341 that talks\nabout assessment, levy, or collection of any debt. Those\nthree words fit perfectly into a property tax scheme.\nThey really don't fit nearly as well into an income tax\nscheme. Are there cases from courts of appeals that say\nthat the -- the act does apply to income tax as well as\nproperty tax?\nMR. GODDARD:\ndistinction -- the cases I'm referring to involve both.\nAnd -- and you're absolutely correct. Many of them are\nproperty tax oriented. That's true of In re Gillis.\nThat's true of several others. Colonial Pipeline is\nanother that I would cite showing a tax benefit not a tax\ndeduction to the State.\nBut the most precisely on point is ACLU\nFoundation v. Bridges from the Fifth Circuit,\ninterestingly after a couple of other cases which might\nhave -- which have been cited by the respondents for their\nproposition that -- that somehow the revenue -- I mean,\nthe State revenue -- things that give revenues to the\nState are significantly different from items that benefit\nthe taxpayer. I would submit that under this scheme and\nunder the scheme that this Court has discussed in the six\ncases that -- where it has discussed the Tax Injunction\nAct in detail speak about a much broader application.\nQUESTION: You were going to go to the history\nor something else. I -- I don't want you to forget that,\nand the reason I don't want you to forget is I'm thinking\nyours is a plausible interpretation --\nMR. GODDARD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- that could be -- well, I mean, it\ncould. I'm about to say maybe it isn't plausible enough.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The -- the -- but what I'm -- what\nI'm driving at is that the -- the Congress might have said\nthat although Federal courts are in the business quite\noften, along with State courts, of deciding whether a\nState law is unconstitutional or violates some other\nFederal law, and although millions of State laws are very\nimportant, we're separating out a set of cases here where\nthey can't do it.\nNow, one reason for doing that would be we don't\nwant to interfere with States getting money that they need\nfor their business. And that would limit these words to\ninterferences with collection of revenue.\nMR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Now, you were about to explain to me\nwhy --\nMR. GODDARD: I -- I would --\nQUESTION: -- there's evidence that Congress\nwanted to do more than that.\nMR. GODDARD: I would greatly appreciate --\nQUESTION: It wanted to do more than that. It\nwanted, in fact, to say you just can't stop them from --\nyou cannot, Federal courts, go and have our tax division\nhere interfered with, even though it doesn't affect\ncollection of revenue. We -- we don't want you to\ninterfere with their rules, with their administration,\nwith anything. You can do it for the police department,\nbut not the tax.\nAll right. Now -- now, what's the evidence\nthat's what -- what Congress wanted?\nMR. GODDARD: Well, the first evidence is the\nwords of the statute. They didn't just say collections.\nQUESTION: All right. The words -- I think\nthey're pretty ambiguous.\nMR. GODDARD: They -- well, they don't just say\ncollections, though, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No, I know.\nMR. GODDARD: They say assessment and levy.\nThose words are not modified.\nQUESTION: Let's go beyond these words.\nMR. GODDARD: Thank you.\nAlso, the history of the Tax Injunction Act --\nit comes from a period when the -- the Congress was\nreacting to this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, and\nthey felt that extensive equitable relief against State\nofficials was inappropriate, and they passed several laws,\nthe Johnson Act and the Tax Injunction Act in the '30's\nbeing the most important, which spoke very broadly about\nkeeping in State courts State proceedings. They did not\nsay anything about just collections, although --\nQUESTION:\nregard, wasn't what Congress had in mind -- it was\ntaxpayer suits. They didn't want taxpayers to avoid going\nthrough the whole process. I mean, most of the cases that\ncome up under the Tax Injunction Act are taxpayers who say\nplease enjoin the tax or don't assess me or don't levy.\nBut this is not that kind of case.\nThere's no one here who's trying to stop the\nState from collecting revenue. It's an attack by a non-\ntaxpayer, and that at the time of the Tax Injunction Act,\nI don't think that kind of action was even on the scene.\nDo you have any claims where a non-taxpayer was seeking to\nenjoin the collection of a tax?\nWhat they -- what -- what Congress was aiming at\nis that, taxpayer, you've got a prompt, speedy, efficient\nremedy in your State, you use that, don't rush to the\nFederal court.\nMR. GODDARD: Your -- Your Honor, the -- the\nCongress had several reasons, and -- and you're absolutely\ncorrect that one of the primary ones was not allowing\ntaxpayers, especially out of State, to come in and\ninterrupt the flow of taxes. I'm not denying that that\nwas a -- a very important reason.\nBut as this Court has said in Rosewell v.\nLaSalle National Bank, if that was the only reason that\nthey were concerned about the collection of taxes, they\ncould have said so. They could have said only diversity\njurisdiction cases will be barred from Federal court.\nThey did not. They used -- they said essentially district\ncourts shall not consider cases to restrain, enjoin, or\nsuspend actions for the assessment, levy, and collection\nof taxes.\nThey also --\nQUESTION: That was a taxpayer's case too,\nwasn't it?\nMR. GODDARD: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Wasn't the case you just cited --\nwasn't it -- that also a taxpayer's attempt to --\nMR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GODDARD: It was an assessment on property.\nQUESTION: So I'm asking you about cases where\nwe don't have a taxpayer who's not trying to stop any\nassessment of his tax, any -- anything else about --\nMR. GODDARD: Well, I guess the -- the direct\ncollision, Your Honor, is between the decision below in\nthe Ninth Circuit and ACLU Foundation v. Bridges --\nQUESTION: It's the only one that I know.\nMR. GODDARD: -- which involves a challenge to a\nspecific tax benefit given to religious organizations in\nLouisiana. So I believe that's as close as I can come.\nYour Honor, if I could reserve the balance of my\ntime, I would like to do so.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Goddard.\nMr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe position of the United States is that\nrespondents' suit is barred by the plain language of the\nTax Injunction Act because it seeks to enjoin and restrain\nthe assessment of a tax under State law.\nAnd to turn directly to the --\nQUESTION: May I ask you if you think the\nlanguage is so plain that we should not even look at the\nlegislative history?\nMR. HUNGAR: We think it's -- yes. We think\nthat the -- the language is sufficiently plain that\nthere's no need to look at the legislative history, but\nthat if you do, the legislative history also supports the\ninterpretation we advance.\nQUESTION: And Judge Easterbrook was just dead\nwrong in looking at the legislative history and he also\ninterpreted it dead wrong.\nMR. HUNGAR: Judge -- the case before Judge\nEasterbrook, Justice Stevens, was quite different from\nthis case. That involved not an -- a -- a suit against\ntax -- the tax collector to affect the manner in which the\ntax collector administered the tax code, but rather a suit\nagainst private plaintiffs who had brought a State court\naction. It was a Federal court suit to enjoin a State\ncourt action. And so the considerations applicable in\nthat case were obviously quite different from those what\nwe have -- where we have presented here.\nThe point of the Tax Injunction Act is to -- to\nprotect the tax collector against Federal court suits to\nenjoin or restrain the tax collector's assessment,\ncollection, and levy of tax.\nQUESTION: Does -- does that -- were you\nfinished your answer?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: The -- the -- if you use the word\nenjoin to mean command, which it can mean, can you say\nthat they are commanding the collection of a tax, contrary\nto the words of the statute?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. We think that is also quite\ncorrect here. That was not the issue addressed by the\nNinth Circuit, but that is certainly another way to get to\nthe result which we think is the correct result, that the\nplain language of the statute bars this kind of suit.\nTurning to the questions about the meaning of\nassessment, it is perfectly clear beyond peradventure that\nunder -- in the Federal system, the term assessment means\nthe tax collector's recorded determination of the amount\nof tax due under Federal law --\nQUESTION: Do we have a self-assessment?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We don't.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is every -- every taxpayer is\nassessed?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the --\nQUESTION: Every taxpayer is assessed even when\nno deficiency is sought?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. The practice of\nthe Internal Revenue Service is to assess the amount of\ntaxes shown on the return if that is -- absent some audit\nor some reason to think there's an error in the return.\nAnd in fact, the Internal Revenue Code so provides.\nSection --\nQUESTION: That every taxpayer is assessed even\nwhen there's no deficiency.\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct. Well, if a taxpayer files\na return showing a bottom line calculation of how much tax\nis due after all credits, deductions, and so forth have\nbeen taken into account, that amount and -- and the tax --\nand the IRS checks the addition, concludes that it's\naccurate, and is not conducting an audit, that amount is\nassessed. It's -- it's recorded in the transcript. Now,\nof course, it's on the computer.\nQUESTION: You don't have to send them a notice\nof -- in other words, I file my income tax. I thought\nthere's some provisions that say if somebody thinks I made\na mistake, they have to send me some special notice. Some\nprocess takes place. We have some other case on this. I\nthought all that involved an assessment, that it was a\nparticular thing under the IRC, not just my filing of a --\nof the return.\nMR. HUNGAR: The assessment is a particular\nthing. Under the Internal Revenue Code, it's the -- it's\nthe tax collect -- the IRS's determination of the amount\nof tax --\nQUESTION: But you just said to Justice Ginsburg\nthat if nothing happens -- like I try to pay my taxes\naccurately. So I file these pieces of paper. And now,\nnothing happens. They just take the money. They cash the\ncheck. And -- and you're going to say when that's all\nthat happened, there was an assessment? I thought it had\na particular meaning that wasn't that, that was when you\nthought I was wrong, you did something and then went after\nme. But -- but it just -- everybody is called an\nassessment? Does it say that in the code where --\nMR. HUNGAR: 26 U.S.C. 6201. This is not in the\n-- the briefs. 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1) provides, quote, the\nSecretary shall assess all taxes determined by the\ntaxpayer or by the Secretary as to which returns or lists\nare made under this title. So if the taxpayer has\nadmitted on their tax return that they owe X dollars in\ntaxes, the Secretary shall assess that amount and also has\nthe discretion to conduct an audit.\nQUESTION: But -- but nobody -- nobody here is\ncontesting, as far as I can tell, what we were told Monday\nis a mere bookkeeping entry. Does it -- does it -- is a\nnotice and demand sent out to everyone who's assessed?\nMR. HUNGAR: Not if the taxpayer has conceded\nthe amount of liability. That's the point. If the\ntaxpayer concedes on the return that their liability is\nX --\nQUESTION: So why is anybody trying to enjoin a\nbookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about?\nMR. HUNGAR: Because assessment is the formal\ndetermination by the -- by the --\nQUESTION: But I don't see that there's any\neffort to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made --\nMR. HUNGAR: There is, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- that nobody gets any notice of and\ndoesn't -- is -- is, we were told, just a mere bookkeeping\nentry. That doesn't -- doesn't -- it's not necessary in\norder to collect the tax?\nMR. HUNGAR: But the statute, Justice Ginsburg,\ndoesn't say anything about notice. It says the -- the\nFederal district courts shall not enjoin the assessment of\na tax under State law.\nQUESTION: But nobody is seeking to enjoin any\nassessment.\nMR. HUNGAR: They -- they are. The plaintiffs\nare seeking --\nQUESTION: They -- as assessment being a\nbookkeeping entry that nobody knows anything about. You\njust said you don't need any notice and demand. In the\nGalletti case, we were told that's what the assessment is.\nIt's a notation in a book someplace. It doesn't even have\nthe taxpayer's name on it.\nMR. HUNGAR: If I may answer, Justice Ginsburg.\nWhat plaintiffs are seeking to do is prevent and restrain\nand enjoin the -- the tax department from assessing taxes\nunder State law in the manner required by State law, which\nincludes, as part of the assessment, computation and\nallowance of the credit where it is due. And the -- and\nthe suit in this case would preclude the tax collector\nfrom doing that if respondents were to succeed.\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nMR. HUNGAR: That's exactly what the act\nprecludes.\nQUESTION: -- does the Arizona tax code have a\nprovision in it comparable to the one that you read us --\nto us from the Federal code?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't believe so, Your Honor. I\nbelieve what the Arizona tax code provides --\nQUESTION: Then it's hardly relevant, is it?\nMR. HUNGAR: -- is that the -- is that the tax\ncollector there, the Department of Revenue, makes a\ndetermination or reviews the returns and ultimately either\ndetermines that that amount will be accepted, that -- that\nthe amount of tax shown on the return is the -- going to\nbe accepted as the amount of tax due from the tax\ncollector, or that they're going to try to require some --\nyou know, assess a deficiency or whatever it may be.\nBut in either case, within the meaning of\nFederal law, the tax collector's determination of what the\namount is due, either if it's the amount shown on return\n-- on the return or if they think it's a different amount,\nwithin the meaning of Federal law, that is the assessment.\nAnd that is what the respondents are trying to\nchange. They're trying to require the tax collector to\nassess taxes not in a manner required under State law,\nwhich is the -- the text of the statute, but rather in a\nmanner contrary to State law.\nQUESTION: Suppose they clarify that they're not\ntrying to stop a bookkeeping entry from being made in\nArizona, even though Arizona law doesn't require it, just\nlike the Feds.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the assessment under\nState law in Arizona includes the tax credit. The\nrespondents would change that and would preclude the tax\ncollector from doing that.\nQUESTION: If they couldn't stop a bookkeeping\nentry, I assume they couldn't stop the acceptance of the\ntax in accordance with a bookkeeping entry. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I -- I assume it's essential to their\ncase that they stop that ultimate bookkeeping entry which\ndetermines how much the taxpayer owes.\nMR. HUNGAR: Exactly.\nAnd the purpose of the --\nQUESTION: Although we were told that there\nisn't that bookkeeping entry in Arizona, that they don't\nhave it.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm\nobviously no expert in Arizona tax law. I'm informed that\nthe tax collector looks at the returns when they come in,\nchecks the addition, and in a certain number of cases goes\nfurther.\nQUESTION: But that's not what you described as\nthe assessment.\nMR. HUNGAR: The assessment is the tax\ncollector's recorded determination of the amount due.\nQUESTION: Which we were told they don't have in\nArizona.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it -- again, I think for\npurposes of Federal law, it -- it is not unreasonable to\nassume that the tax collector in Arizona decides whether\nthey're going to accept the amount of return shown on the\ntax as --\nQUESTION: And keeps a record of it.\nMR. HUNGAR: And keeps a record of it. Exactly.\nQUESTION: I mean, he must keep a record of it\nfor --\nMR. HUNGAR: Exactly, exactly. Now, the\nAttorney General can address that, but -- but that's my\nunderstanding of Arizona law.\nQUESTION: Isn't the case just simpler if we say\nyou cannot command the collection of a tax, which is\nwhat's happening here?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Justice Kennedy. That -- that\nis exactly right. That is -- that is entirely consistent\nwith the United States' view of and interpretation of this\nact and the Anti-Injunction Act.\nAnd it's also consistent with the legislative\nhistory and purposes of the act. This Court has\nrepeatedly recognized, in Justice O'Connor's opinion for\nthe -- for the Court in the Grace Brethren case and in\nother cases, that the purpose of the act sweeps more\nbroadly than simply a focus on collection and --\nQUESTION: But those were all taxpayers trying\nto stop the collection of tax from them.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but the\nCourt did not say that the purpose and scope of the act is\nlimited to that context, nor is the language limited to\nthat context. To the contrary, the Court said this -- the\nact sweeps broadly to prevent Federal court interference\nin the administration of -- of State tax systems.\nQUESTION: But wouldn't you agree that the\nprimary purpose of the statute was to protect the State's\nfisc?\nMR. HUNGAR: That is certainly a primary purpose\nof the statute.\nQUESTION:\nrelevant, you lose on that purpose.\nMR. HUNGAR: It's -- it's not applicable here,\nalthough I think it is important to recognize that it\nwould be quite extraordinary for Federal courts to be in\nthe business of ordering State tax collectors to collect\n-- to collect taxes from their citizens that the\nlegislature of the State had deemed should not be\ncollected.\nQUESTION: It's curious that the Moore's Federal\nPractice and Wright and Miller and Hart and Wechsler all\nsuggest that the Tax Injunction Act does not prevent a\nchallenge in Federal court to the constitutionality of\nState tax credits. They seem uniform in that view.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think some of those quotes,\nif I recall correctly, Justice O'Connor, deal with -- they\nsay the -- the Tax Injunction Act does not apply to suits\nto collect taxes, which is a different situation than\nhere.\nQUESTION: Well, they speak in terms of tax\ncredits.\nHas this Court taken some cases that appear to\nfly in the face of your theory and just not said anything\nabout it?\nMR. HUNGAR: This Court in two or three cases\nidentified by respondents has not addressed the Tax\nInjunction Act where it might be -- it might be relevant.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Cohen, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN S. COHEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'll begin by stating what our position is. The\nTax Injunction Act and the associated principles of comity\nonly -- only -- apply when a district court is asked to\nstop the flow of revenue to the State. For more than 60\nyears, the act and the associated principles of comity\nhave been applied only when claimants sought to stop the\nflow of tax revenues. The decisions of this Court support\nthis.\nIn challenges to tax credits, the Tax Injunction\nAct has been either not considered at all by this Court or\nin other Federal courts has specifically -- they've\nspecifically held, except in Bridges last summer --\nthey've specifically held that the Tax Injunction Act did\nnot apply.\nIt -- this is -- also our position is consistent\nwith the revenue protective purpose of the Tax Injunction\nAct and common sense supports this. If there's no threat\nto the flow of State revenue -- State tax revenues, then\nthe administration of the State tax laws is the same as\nthe administration of education laws and penal laws --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cohen, going back to the\nlanguage, assessment, levy, or collection of any tax,\nwhich was the subject of questions to your -- your\nopponent, you don't question, do you, that the statute\napplies to income taxes as well as to property taxes?\nMR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't question\nthat.\nQUESTION: And would you question its\napplicability if the -- the State could not point to a\nparticular act of assessment or levy or collection in its\nprocedures?\nMR. COHEN: Your Honor, we view the phrase,\nenjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or\ncollection, as a phrase. We -- we don't believe that any\none word there has special meanings. That phrase has been\ninterpreted by the courts to say that the process of\ncausing a flow of tax revenues to the State will not be\nstopped.\nQUESTION: You mean I -- I can't read this\nstatute to say that the district court shall not enjoin\nthe collection of a tax? I have to read all the other\nthings with it?\ninterpretation of any statute.\nMR. COHEN: Justice Kennedy, the -- let's take a\n-- I -- I believe the idea was that there is a process.\nThe -- at the time the word assessment was first used, it\nwas 1867 in the Federal Anti-Injunction Act, which was the\nmodel for the Tax Injunction Act in 1937, as this Court\nheld in Jefferson County. And at that time if a -- and a\n-- the assessment process which was valuing property -- if\nthat had been stopped, then -- then they wouldn't get to\nthe collection phase, or if they stopped the levy phase,\nthey wouldn't get to the collection phase. So it's a --\nthe concept was that it took these three things to make\nthe flow of revenue come to the State.\nAnd that while individuals have an option under\nthe section 1983 and 1343 together to choose either the\nFederal or State courts in which to vindicate their\nconstitutional rights, the Congress decided that they\nshould not have that option if it could interfere -- if it\ncould stop the flow of revenues to the State --\nQUESTION: Let's assume --\nMR. COHEN: -- but it didn't go farther than\nthat.\nQUESTION: Let's assume it means just that.\nMR. COHEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And -- and let's assume that -- that\nyou get your injunction in a Federal district court\nagainst the Secretary of State's collection of this tax.\nWhat is the Secretary of State to do? His -- his State\nstatute tells him that he should collect less. This\ninjunction says he should collect more. He will appeal\nthe case from the district court to the court of appeals.\nMeanwhile, what is he to do? He is not authorized by\nState law, which he thinks is valid, to collect more.\nIt seems to me during the whole period while\nthat -- that case is on appeal from the district court to\nthe court of appeals to the Supreme Court, if it gets\nhere, the Secretary of State doesn't know what to do, and\nhis collection of the tax is impaired.\nMR. COHEN: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that so?\nMR. COHEN: The -- two -- two answers, if -- if\nyou allow me. The first is that the district court, of\ncourse, has the power to stay the effectiveness of that\njudgment until there is a final decision, and he could be\nasked --\nQUESTION: Well, then the statute wouldn't apply\nI suppose. It just says it shall not enjoin. We're\nassuming it has enjoined. If your reading is correct, it\nshould be able to enjoin because there's nothing wrong\nwith enjoining. Okay?\nLet's assume it does enjoin. Does that not\ninterfere with the collection, even if you think that\nthat's -- that's all that's at issue is the collection of\ntaxes? How is the State going to collect its taxes?\nMR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, the statute does not\nsay interfere. The statute talks about stopping the\ncollection, and this would not stop the collection. It\nwould -- it would allow the collection --\nQUESTION: You have a much narrower position.\nYour earlier position was this whole purpose was just to\nprotect the State's tax revenue and so long as it doesn't\nimpair that. Now you say it can impair that so long as it\ndoes not enjoin it. That's a much narrower position.\nMR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, I'm not saying that.\nI -- I -- you --\nQUESTION: I thought that's what --\nMR. COHEN: I must have misspoke myself because\nwhat I am saying is that they can't stop the collection of\ntaxes and that this would not stop the collection.\nQUESTION: But the statute doesn't say stop. It\nsays enjoin and enjoin can mean -- can mean command.\nMR. COHEN: In Jefferson --\nQUESTION: And that's exactly what you're doing.\nYou're commanding the collection of the tax.\nMR. COHEN:\nCounty, this Court unanimously interpreted the statute to\nsay stop the collection. That's what this Court said in\nJefferson County, and there are a number of cases in which\na commandment seeking to command the payment of taxes has\nbeen held to be outside the Tax Injunction Act.\nQUESTION: Can I bring you -- can I bring you\nback to my question which I don't think I got an answer\nto? What is the Secretary of State supposed to do? He\nhas gotten an order from a Federal district court to\ncollect more taxes than he is authorized to collect under\nState law. He intends to appeal that district court\norder, but meanwhile, he has been enjoined from\ncollecting. What is he supposed to do?\nMR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, he obeys the order\nof the court and he's -- he's only enjoined from --\nQUESTION: Well, that means --\nMR. COHEN: He's only enjoined with regard to\nthe tax credit. He's not enjoined from collecting the tax\nwhich includes not honoring the tax credit.\nQUESTION: And I take that -- I take it that's\nthe answer to -- to Justice Kennedy's question, that his\nobligation to collect the tax is an obligation under State\nlaw, and once he is enjoined from recognizing the credit,\nhe simply follows State law and collects the tax without\nreference to the credit.\ndoesn't say, you go out and collect the tax. The State\nlaw does that. Is -- is -- do you buy that?\nMR. COHEN: Yes, absolutely.\nQUESTION: He believes the district court\ndecision is wrong, and let's assume it is wrong. What is\nhe supposed to do while it is on appeal?\nMR. COHEN: Unless it -- Your Honor, unless it\nis stayed, he is to obey it, and --\nQUESTION: And that does not --\nMR. COHEN: It does not interfere with the\ncollection -- with the flow -- it does not interfere with\nthe flow of revenue to the State, and that's what the Tax\nInjunction Act is basically about.\nQUESTION: He -- he obeys the injunction and he\nobeys State law except with respect to the credit which he\nis enjoined from giving.\nMR. COHEN: I agree, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the result is that he collects\nthe -- the full tax. That's the way it would work.\nMR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose the State law says\nif these tax credits are invalidated, all other taxpayers\nshall be assessed an additional 2 percent to make up for\n-- I'm sorry. If these -- if these tax credits are\ninvalidated, other taxpayers shall be -- their taxes shall\nbe reduced by 1 percent. Okay? I mean, the -- the State\nlooks forward to this possibility that there will be an\ninjunction. What is the Secretary of State to do then?\nIs he to assess everybody else at a lesser amount?\nMR. COHEN: Your Honor, I believe --\nQUESTION: In other words, he is prevented from\ncollecting the additional amount that he would have had to\ncollect from other taxpayers had this tax credit been\nacknowledged. The tax credit is struck down, and what the\nlaw says is, if it's struck down, you have to collect more\nfrom everybody else. Now, I assume in that situation the\ndistrict court would not be able to enjoin the collection,\nwould it?\nSo all you're talking about is whether the State\nlaw is -- is drafted in a clever way or not.\nMR. COHEN: Your Honor, if -- if the tax credit\nis struck down, the State gets more money. It has no need\nto assess an additional 1 or 2 percent of its taxpayers.\nBut if -- if the State in its wisdom chose to do so, then\nwhoever collects taxes would obey the State law until\nanother case came to court and another judge told them\nwhat to do.\nQUESTION: All right. So -- so there would be\nsome interference. But what do you do about the word?\nI mean, I'm somewhat shaken by the fact that the\n-- the Internal Revenue Code does -- as I have just read\n6201 and 6203, it does use that word assessment as\napparently to refer simply to the record keeping function\nof the tax division which it says under rules and\nregulations the assessment shall be made by recording the\nliability of the taxpayer in the Office of the Secretary.\nAnd therefore, what it seems to have in mind in the IRC is\na simple bookkeeping notation of how much money this\ntaxpayer owes which takes place in every case.\nNow, the -- the act says there shall be no suit\nthat restrains the assessment of that tax; i.e., you\ncannot restrain the Secretary in noting the amount that\nthe taxpayer owes.\nNow, they're saying stop right there. End of\nthe matter. Now, what in your opinion overcomes that\nargument?\nMR. COHEN: Your Honor, Justice Breyer, it's\ninteresting about the Internal Revenue Code and the -- the\nFederal income tax law because there is a corollary to the\nTax Injunction Act: the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867. And\nit uses the word assessment. And there are a number of\nFederal court decisions saying that that does not apply to\ntax credits. And in each --\nQUESTION: That's not an answer for the\nreason --\nMR. COHEN: May I --\nQUESTION: -- that they're saying they're wrong,\njust as they say we were wrong in five cases not to notice\nthis. So continue, please.\nMR. COHEN: Yes. None of them -- none of them\nlooked at the word assessment in isolation. What it\nlooked at -- what those cases looked at was the phrase, as\n-- as I've suggested to the Court, that the phrase\nassessment, levy, and collection is the process of\ncreating the flow of revenue.\nQUESTION: But it isn't and; it's or. Isn't it?\nMR. COHEN: The -- Justice Scalia, it -- it is\nor for purposes of saying that you can't restrain any of\nthose because if you restrain any of those in the context\nof creating the stream of revenue, you have stopped the\nstream of revenue. And that -- that's what history of the\nact shows, the purpose of the act.\nQUESTION: So your answer is this. You say\nindeed they've got it correctly defined. Indeed, it says\nassessment. It says assessment, levy, or collection. But\nthat phrase does not refer to every assessment, levy, or\ncollection. Rather, in context it refers to those\nassessments, levies, and collections that will have, were\nthey enjoined, the impact of cutting the revenue stream\nflowing to the State.\nMR. COHEN: That's our position, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's your view. So we should look\nat that in context. That's why you go to the history and\nthese other things.\nMR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. I understand.\nMR. COHEN: I -- I would like to also point out\nto the Court that this use of a tax credit as a mechanism\ncould also to -- that is to funnel money to school tuition\norganizations could just as well have been an\nappropriation of dollars and vouchers. And if instead the\nState was giving vouchers to school tuition organizations,\n93 percent of which went to religious schools, there would\nbe no question about the individual citizen's option to\nchoose to go to the Federal court.\nQUESTION: But it wasn't done that way. I mean,\nit's just like saying it could have been extracted by\ntorture too, and that would have been clearly\nunconstitutional.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But that happens not to be the way it\nwas done.\nMR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor, but in\nNyquist this Court particularly pointed out that a tax\ncredit was the same as giving money to the State. That --\nthat was this Court dealing with a tax credit that --\nwhere the money was used to support religious schools,\nwhich is just what we're asserting here.\nQUESTION: Mueller certainly distinguished that\npart of Nyquist.\nMR. COHEN: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. I\ndidn't --\nQUESTION: The Mueller against Allen case surely\ndistinguished that part of Nyquist. I mean, it's much\nless valuable to -- after Mueller than it was before\nMueller.\nMR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, Mueller was a tax\ndeduction case rather than a tax credit case. In a tax\ncredit case --\nQUESTION: Why should -- why should that make\nany difference to your argument?\nMR. COHEN: It -- generally, it wouldn't, but a\ntax credit is every dollar that goes to the benefit of the\nschool tuition organization -- if it wasn't given to them,\nevery dollar of that would go to the State. In a tax\ndeduction, a tax deduction is a more generalized --\nhelping to support charity, and only a portion of that\nmoney goes to the State --\nQUESTION: Yes. It may be -- it may be a\nsmaller amount, but in both cases it goes to the person\nwho -- who claims it.\nMR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct,\nbut it's a smaller percentage. My use of tax credit with\nNyquist is that that's an unusual feature of Nyquist is\nit's dollar for dollar. In Mueller, there was the --\nthere were a number of considerations when you deal with a\ntax deduction. They're a little different than tax\ncredit, and this Court has recognized those. Generally\nthey are tax benefits and generally they are to be\nconsidered outside the Tax Injunction Act according to the\ncases.\nQUESTION: Is the point you're making is -- is\nit's the taxpayer who's designating a certain portion of\nmoney which would otherwise go to the general revenues\nwill instead go to this charitable purpose. It's kind of\nlike on the Federal return where you can check off and say\nI want $3 -- instead of going to general revenues, it goes\nto fund campaign -- to presidential elections.\nMR. COHEN: Justice --\nQUESTION: That's on the -- that's what this is,\nisn't it?\nMR. COHEN: Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly\nright. That's what I'm saying.\nAnd if you have no further questions --\nQUESTION: I have --\nQUESTION: I do. I do have one.\nQUESTION: Don't kid yourself.\nQUESTION: Go on. Go first.\nQUESTION: I just want to make sure I didn't\nmiss something in your argument, Mr. Cohen. Talking about\nthe history of this statute, did you refer to an earlier\nstatute that used the similar language in the same order,\nassessment, levy, and collection or collection and levy,\nwhichever it is, and that that statute only applied to\nreal estate taxes? Was that -- did you say that? I want\nto make sure I didn't --\nMR. COHEN: Justice Stewart, I was referring to\nthe Anti-Injunction Act of 1867 --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. COHEN: -- in which the word levy was not\nused. It was assessment or collection, and I said it was\nin the context of valuation then because there was no\nincome tax in 1867. And that could be -- for instance, I\nknow there weren't Federal property taxes, but it could be\nin -- in valuation of -- of property for tariffs coming in\nor things of that nature. The word assessment then was\nnot used in the context of the income tax laws. That's\nall I was saying because there were none.\nQUESTION: And -- and it would be perfectly\nnatural in the real estate tax context to use them in that\norder because the assessment comes first. Whereas, the\nargument of your opponents here is the assessment is the\nlast thing in the chain of events, which seems somewhat\ncounter-intuitive if you're -- when you're referring to\nincome taxes.\nMR. COHEN: I -- I agree, Justice Stewart.\nQUESTION: See, this -- in -- in -- do you know\nthis in State tax systems? Apparently in the Federal tax\nsystem assessment refers to an official determination of\nthe amount that the individual taxpayer owes. Now, there\nare 50 State systems plus the District of Columbia. Do\nyou know if there are a significant number of States that\nwould not consider that official determination of the\namount owed to be an assessment?\nMR. COHEN: Mr. Justice Breyer, no, I do not\nknow. We haven't done a survey of the States.\nQUESTION: But the question I was going to put\nwas you -- you say that the -- the principal purpose of\nthis law was to protect the fisc of the State. And I --\nyou know, I will concede that, that -- that what Congress\nwas most concerned about was preventing somebody from\nstopping the State from collecting money. But it's not\nunusual that Congress drafts its prohibitions broader than\nis necessary to achieve just the narrow purpose. And if\nindeed they -- they prohibited not just stopping the\ncollection but also stopping the assessment, it seems to\nme we have to take the statute for what it says, if indeed\nthis is an assessment. And the mere fact that it goes\nbeyond what the principal purpose was, I mean, that --\nthat's often the case with statutes.\nMR. COHEN: Justice Scalia, the State contends\nand the United States both contend that this statute is --\nthe purpose of it was to stop any court -- Federal court\ninterference with the tax administration process itself.\nAnd the -- the Federal court decisions, other than\nBridges, reject that point of view.\nAnd this Court rejected that point of view in\nJefferson County when the -- the issue there was that the\ncounty had sued in the State court against Federal judges\nto try to get an occupational tax. And the Federal judges\nremoved the case to Federal court, and the county said,\nwell, the Tax Injunction Act applies here because the\nFederal judges are going to raise State tax issues and\nthis Federal court will be deciding cases having to do\nwith State tax administration. And they cited the\nKelleher case out of the Second Circuit which it held that\nthe Tax Injunction Act was so broad that it applied to tax\n-- all State tax administration. And this Court rejected\nthat position, and this Court I believe unanimously\noverruled Kelleher. So we --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cohen, we are ships passing in\nthe night because you're -- I don't care what the purpose\nwas. I care what the language says, and my point is that\nvery often the language goes beyond the narrow purpose\nthat Congress had in mind. And when -- when the language\ndoes so, we read the statute as it's written, but you\ndon't -- don't agree with that apparently. We -- we have\nto intuit the purpose and limit the language no matter\nwhat it says to that purpose.\nMR. COHEN: Mr. Justice, I -- I'm saying that\nfor 60 years with the Tax Injunction Act and for 150 years\n-- no -- I guess 140 years with the Anti-Injunction Act\nthat is the way the Federal courts -- the way we're\nsuggesting is the way the Federal courts have interpreted\nthis language.\nAnd we suggest that if there's a problem, as\nlong as the tax revenue is flowing to the State and we're\nnot interfering -- we're not stopping that, if there's a\nproblem with -- with that system that's been there now\nfor, oh, 100, 60 years for States, 140 years for the\nFederal fisc, if there's a problem, the States can take\nthat problem to Congress to change this exemption. This\nis an exemption from the Federal jurisdiction, which under\nthe Phillips case is to be narrowly construed. If -- if\nthey -- if there's a real problem -- and I suggest there\nis not because the money will continue to flow to the\nState notwithstanding our -- the Federal court\njurisdiction here.\nAnd we believe that the law should not be\nchanged and we request that the -- this Court remain with\nthe past 60 years and 140 years of judicial experience on\nthis issue.\nThank you very --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cohen --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cohen.\nGeneral Goddard, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GODDARD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIf -- if I may go to the overriding principle\nhere because I think to some extent that's what governs\nthe actions of the State and should be appropriate here.\nAs this Court said in -- many years ago under\nthe principle of comity, which Mr. Cohen referred to,\ncomity refers to the scrupulous regard for the rightful\nindependence of State governments which should at all\ntimes actuate the Federal courts and a proper reluctance\nto interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations.\nThat's Matthews v. Rodgers.\nQUESTION:\nNyquist and Mueller? Is that just the Court overlooked\nit?\nMR. GODDARD: Your -- Your Honor, the Court did\nnot deal in any way with the issue of -- of section 1341\nin either Nyquist or Mueller, and I believe under -- under\nyour decision in DeBuono there is -- which also deals with\n1341 and the failure to raise it, there can be a\npresumption that the escape clause was exercised. It is\n-- if there is no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy under\nState law, obviously jurisdiction in the Federal court is\nappropriate.\nQUESTION: But there -- one sees plain, speedy,\nand effective --\nMR. GODDARD: Efficient.\nQUESTION: -- that's a taxpayer who has to go\nthrough the system. But that -- that's -- how does that\nfit when it's a non-taxpayer who's stopping -- who's --\nwho's trying to declare a credit unconstitutional? This\n-- this quick, speedy remedy is -- is that the taxpayer\ngets a refund remedy, gets a deficiency, whatever it is,\nbut how does this swift -- how does that play into\nsomebody who is not a taxpayer?\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, in -- in the Anti-\nInjunction Act, that creates a serious problem. In the --\nin this issue -- and I think that a critical thing is\nthese -- these taxpayers have a remedy at State law. This\ncase was decided by the Arizona Supreme Court in Kotterman\nv. Killian, and this -- this -- the Supreme Court denied\ncert 4 years ago. The exact same issues that have been\nbrought forward in Federal court by the petitioners in\nthis case were decided by the Arizona Supreme Court under\nthe Arizona constitution and the United States\nConstitution, and there was not an establishment issue in\nthis case.\nAnd that brings me back --\nQUESTION: I meant within the meaning of the\nInjunction Act, it seems that swift, whatever, remedy was\nreferring to the taxpayer's remedy under State law --\nMR. GODDARD: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- could take care of --\nMR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor, and under the\nFederal law there's a problem because you can't pay a tax\nand get it refunded if you're a third party. But in\nArizona law, there is standing for -- for these parties\nand that's already been exercised. They're trying to take\nanother shot by going into Federal court and trying to get\nan -- another opinion which will deviate from the Arizona\nSupreme Court.\nAnd excuse me. If I could refer --\nQUESTION: The same plaintiffs? If it's the\nsame plaintiffs, you would have a -- a --\nMR. GODDARD: Your Honor, I -- I didn't mean to\nimply they were the same plaintiffs, but they were exactly\nthe same issues in turning a constitutional violation.\nIf I could to Justice Scalia's earlier question,\nas the -- as the legal representative of the Arizona\nDepartment of Revenue, if there were an adverse decision\nin the -- in the district court of Arizona -- and our\nSupreme Court has already spoken on the same issue -- I\nhave a very hard time advising a client as to what they\nshould do going forward in terms of honoring, under\nArizona law, the school tax credit.\nQUESTION: We have that same problem in habeas\nsometimes too when the State Supreme Court disagrees with\nthe Federal district court.\nMR. GODDARD: Yes, Your Honor, but in the\nsituation in habeas, we don't have the Tax Injunction Act.\nWe don't have a specific legislative bar that says there\nwill not be jurisdiction in the district court if there is\na plain, speedy, and efficient remedy at the State court.\nAnd I believe that is -- it doesn't tolerate any -- any\ndegrees of variation. As this Court has said, it's --\nit's automatic. There is -- it is -- there are no\nexceptions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:\nGoddard.\n"
