Brand X Internet Services.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-281\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress\ndeclared that it is the policy of the United States to\npreserve the vibrant and competitive free market that\npresently exists for the Internet unfettered by federal or\nstate regulation. The FCC implemented that clear policy\ndirective in the order under review by concluding that\ncable modem service should be classified as an information\nservice and not a telecommunications service under the\nCommunications Act. That reasonable determination should\nbe upheld, because it is consistent with the text,\nhistory, and purposes of the Act.\nThe Act defines \"telecommunications\" as the\ntransmission of information without change in form or\nsubstance, and \"telecommunications service\" as the\noffering of telecommunications directly to the public for\na fee.\nGiven that focus on the nature of the \"offering\nto the public,\" the FCC reasonably concluded that the\nintegrated cable modem service offering should be viewed\nas a whole in determining its classification under the\nAct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why is that reasonable?\nI mean, why is it offered to the public if it's offered\nalone, but it's not offered to the public if it's offered\nwith a tie-in? I mean, if -- you know, if I say, you\nknow, I'm selling you a windshield alone, I guess I'm\noffering a windshield. But if I say, you know, you've got\nto buy the windshield with a car, am I any less selling\nyou a windshield?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think we would say,\nin that example, that you are offering windshields, per\nse. I mean, to give an example, carmax.com offers cars\nfor sale over the Internet, but I don't think we would\nordinarily say that they are offering windshields or\nsteering wheels or tires for sale. Certainly, that's not\nbeen necessary construction of a regulatory regime that,\nsay, is designed to focus on sellers of tires. It\nwouldn't automatically, as a matter of law, have to be\napplied to entities that are selling cars instead. And\nthe same is true here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose I just tie it in\nwith windshield wipers.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can only buy my windshield\nif you buy the windshield wipers with it. Am I no longer\nselling a windshield because I'm selling it with -- only\nwith windshield wipers?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think it would depend on\nthe nature of the regulatory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fifty-fifty.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- regime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But don't you think that the\ntelecommunications aspect of what's going on here is at\nleast as important as the information aspect of it? The\ninformation is useless unless it can be conveyed.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, the -- and, by the same\ntoken, the transmission component is useless unless it\noffers all of the -- all of the information-services type\nfunctionality that Internet service offers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily. You could --\nyou can use that broadband service to go to other\ninformation providers.\nMR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, it's the -- it's\nthe capabilities that you purchase in the integrated\npackage -- not the pure transmission, but the other\ncapabilities, the computer data-processing, data-access\ncapabilities that are an essential part of that. If all\nyou had was the transmission, with none of the other\ncomputer functionality -- if you typed in the Supreme\nCourt's Website, for instance, supremecourtus.gov, nothing\nwould happen, because all of the computer functionality,\nlike the domain-name system, which is a very\nsophisticated, complex, distributed database involving\nliterally millions of computers around the world, that's\ndata processing. That's information-services capability\nthat you use every time you type in a Website.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.\nMR. HUNGAR: It's not just transmission. It's\nmuch more than that. And without the -- without the\ncomputer data-processing aspects, it doesn't do anything.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree, but the question isn't\nwhether it doesn't do anything; the question is whether\nyou are still offering telecommunications services to the\npublic. And it seems to me -- look it, I offer you\nbroadband, initially without any information function at\nthe end of it, and you're using this broadband to do all\nsorts of good stuff, going where you want, getting what\nyou want, conveying what you want. And then I change my\nrules and I say, \"You know, in the future the only way I'm\noffering this broadband is if you, in addition to buying\nthe broadband communications capacity, buy my information\ntechnology at the end of it.\" Have I suddenly stopped\nselling the broadband -- or offering the broadband to the\npublic? I just don't think that's a reasonable --\nMR. HUNGAR: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- use of language.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- well, two points. Your question\nstarts with, I think, an incorrect assumption about the\nnature of the world. The pure transmission function has\nnot been offered to the public, to consumers, separately\nand apart -- again, it doesn't do anything. Consumers\ndon't use the pure transmission functions by itself.\n\"Internet service,\" by definition, includes the data-\nprocessing aspects that the Commission so found on this\nrecord, and that factual determine is reasonable and\nsupported by the record.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was giving you a\nhypothetical. I --\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in the -- in the\nhypothetical, it's conceivable that a different result\nmight be reached by the regulatory agency with authority\nfor construing the statute and applying it to particular\nfact situations. But I don't think the word \"offering\"\nnecessarily and always compels the conclusion that any\ncomponent of an integrated offering is also separately\nbeing offered within the meaning of the statute. It\ndepends on the purposes of the statute, as construed by\nthe regulatory agency. \"Offering\" is ambiguous. And,\ntherefore, what the agency has done here is reasonable.\nAnd it's supported, I would add, by the\nconsistent pre-1996 regulatory approach in this area,\nwhich all parties agreed Congress incorporated into the\n1996 Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if you do the same\ncombination over telephone lines, you say they are -- they\nare selling --\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- offering to the public\ncommunications service.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's because the telephone\ncompanies have always offered a standalone transmission\ncomponent which other -- which other ISPs can utilize.\nThey've done that because of the preexisting regulatory\nregime. They've always made the separate offering;\ntherefore, it is a telecommunications service.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What bearing does history have\nupon the definitional question of whether, when you sell a\nbundled offering of information technology and\ncommunications, you are selling communications?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With respect to the telephone\nlong-lines, you say, yes, you are; and with respect to\ncable, you say, no, you aren't.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, it's certainly not\nunusual for this Court, in construing a statute, to look\nto the regulatory history that led up to the enactment of\nthe statute, particularly where it's clear in the\nlegislative history that Congress was in -- was\nessentially borrowing from the pre-1996 regulatory\ndefinitions, the definitional scheme that the Commission\nadopted in 1980 in its Computer II report. All parties\nagree that that definitional framework forms the\nfoundation for the very definitions at issue here. That's\nundisputed.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Hungar, what is the\ntentative decision the FCC has taken on the DSL\nregulation?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the FCC has tentatively\nconcluded that when a telephone company makes an\nintegrated offering of the DSL transmission capacity with\nthe Internet service, as a combined offering to consumers,\nthat, tentatively that is an information service,\nprecisely the classification that you --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Even though --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- read here.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- telephone lines have\nalways been subject to common-carrier regulation.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct. And even though --\nwhen a telephone company is making a separate standalone\noffering of just the pure DSL transmission capacity, which\nis useful only to ISPs, to Internet Service Providers, not\nto consumers, that that would be viewed, has traditionally\nbeen viewed, as a common-carriage offering, because it's\npure transmission. But when it's a bundled -- or when\nit's an integrated offering -- again, this goes back to\n1980. This very issue, Justice Scalia, was addressed by\nthe Commission in 1980, and it said, if the offering is\nlimited to pure transmission, it is basic\ntelecommunications, basic service, the precursor to\ntelecommunications service; but if you add any computer\nfunctionality to the offering, then it is not basic, it is\nenhanced service. They said that at paragraphs 93 to 97\nof the ---\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand what --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- Computer II order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're saying, but they're\ndoing it all on policy grounds. This definition means\nthis, because that produces a good result. With respect\nto telephone lines, they say, yes, bundled is, or it\nisn't, depending upon whether we like the result it\nproduces.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just doesn't seem to --\nMR. HUNGAR: It depends on the nature of the\noffering. If the entity is offering -- if cable\ncompanies, tomorrow, start offering pure cable\ntransmission on an -- on a nondiscriminate basis, that\nwould regulated as a telecommunications service. But what\nthe Commission has always said is that you look at the\noffering as a whole, and if it's a -- an integrated\noffering that encompasses not just telecommunications, but\ndata-processing, and computer-type services, as well, it's\nin the enhanced or information-service category that --\nthe Commission said, in 1980, \"We're doing this, in part,\nbecause it's not clear -- it's clear that Congress didn't\nintend, in the 1934 Act, to extend regulation to this new\n-- this novel, new type of intermingled service, and it\nwould be inappropriate, we think, to try and extend the\nAct to that, for a number of reasons, including that it's\nvery hard to draw lines between which is -- which has more\nof a communications versus data-processing component.\nThey had tried that, and concluded that it was\nunworkable.\" And so, they drew the line. Basic\ntransmission, pure transmission, if the offering is\nlimited to that, it is on the telecommunications service,\nor basic-service line; if it contains the computer-\nprocessing capabilities, data acquisition and retrieval\nand the like --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it seems to be saying,\nbecause the cable companies do not offer separate\ntelecommunications service, they don't have to offer it.\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, it just -- it's\nalmost question-begging. It's peculiar.\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. It's\nonly -- it only -- it's only question-begging because the\nRespondents have attempted to mischaracterize or\nmisdescribe what is going on here. The rule is, if you\nare a common carrier, as the telephone companies are, and,\nin 1980, the FCC was regulating in an environment when\nthere was only one avenue into the home, one\ncommunications avenue, the telephone line, and they said,\n\"Under these circumstances, telephone common carriers are\nnot going to be allowed to escape Title II regulation\ncompletely by offering enhanced services, if they can\noffer an enhanced service, an intermingled -- integrated\ntransmission and computer data-processing service, and\nthat service, as a whole, when it's offered, will be\nunregulated, because Title II does not extend to those\ntypes of integrated service offerings.\" They said,\n\"However, if you -- if it is a telephone common carrier\nthat's making that offering, a facilities-based,\ntypically-monopoly common carrier, they will have an\nobligation to also make a standalone offering of\ntransmission under Title II, because they were telephone\n-- traditional common carriers.\"\nCable companies are not in that category. They\nhave not traditionally been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say -- you say that\nthe FCC is changing its view. It has tentatively changed\nits view. So it will bracket the telephone companies with\nthe cable companies.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, actually, that's an important\npoint, Justice Ginsburg. The FCC has never said that an\nintegrated offering of DSL that -- DSL Internet service,\nthe combined integrated offering, the analog to what we\nhave here, in the cable context -- the FCC has never said\nthat that is not an information service. They have -- and\nthey have tentatively concluded now that it is. What they\nhave said -- what they said in the 1998 order that\nRespondents cite was that the telecommunications -- the\ntelephone companies are already offering DSL on a\nstandalone, pure-transmission basis to other competing\nInternet Service Providers; therefore, it is a\ntelecommunications service. Indeed, it was undisputed\nthat it was a telecommunications service. And, again, the\nreason they were doing that, we assume, is because the\npreexisting Computer II and Computer III framework\nrequired the telephone carriers to make that standalone\noffering. But the Commission has not said the integrated\noffering is also a telecommunications service, and it has\nnow tentatively concluded that it is an information\nservice, in keeping with 25 years of regulatory history\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be left in the\ncommon-carrier category?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, any standalone, pure-\ntransmission offering, including, under the Computer II\nrationale, to the extent the Commission adheres to it --\nand it hasn't overturned it yet; it's considering the\nextent to which it should create an exception in the DSL\ncontext -- but under Computer II, a basic, traditional\ncommon carrier cannot get away -- cannot get out of Title\nII regulation by offering an integrated offering. They\nwill also have to make the standalone offering, unless and\nto the extent the Commission determines that that's not\nnecessary; for instance, because the enhanced or\nintegrated -- information-service market is sufficiently\ncompetitive that it's not necessary and there are adequate\nalternative --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's wonderful policy\n--\nMR. HUNGAR: -- communications pipelines.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's wonderful policy, but\nI don't -- what I'm still waiting to hear is how you get\nthat out of the definitions, which is the lever that the\nCommission is using to implement this good policy. It is\nsaying, in some cases, that a bundled offering is an\noffering of telecommunications; and, in other cases, it's\nsaying a bundled offering isn't. And the reason, you say,\nis not because of the nature of the thing, because of the\ndefinition, it's because you tell us it has good\nconsequences in one case, and doesn't have good\nconsequences in the other.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I'm sorry, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not my understanding --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- of how definitions work.\nMR. HUNGAR: Let me try to clarify what the\nCommission's position is. The Commission has never said,\nthat I am aware of or that Respondents have pointed out,\nthat the integrated -- bundled, if you will -- the\nintegrated offering of transmission plus Internet service\nfunctionality is a telecommunications service. They have\nnever said that. They have said that some companies,\ntelephone common carriers, will be required to make the\nseparate offering, but it is not correct that the\nintegrated offering is, itself, going to be classified as\na telecommunications service. It's classified --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- as information.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in effect, it's the\nunbundling requirement which is your answer to Justice\nScalia's -- Why should that make a difference? I mean,\nyou could just as well make an unbundling requirement with\nrespect to cable.\nMR. HUNGAR: You could. And, in fact, the\nCommission is -- has issued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking and an invitation for comment in the order\nunder review here to consider whether it should make such\na requirement under its ancillary Title I authority in\nthis context, and what -- and, if so, to what extent?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the reason for a\ndistinction, at least at the present time -- the reason\nfor the reasonableness of the distinction at the present\ntime, as a source of applying this definition, is history,\nbasically.\nMR. HUNGAR: History and, not unrelated to that,\nthe fact that the cable companies have not traditionally\nbeen regulated as common carriers under the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- Title II of the Act. Yes,\nthat's correct.\nAnd then just one final point, if I may --\nJustice Scalia, I think this also goes to your question --\nRespondents are the ones who are being inconsistent, and\nthat -- the states, for instance, they suggest that,\n\"Well, if\" -- they say that, \"Well, cable modem service\nshould be regulated as a telecommunications service, in\npart.\" But, of course, traditional information service\nproviders, ISPs, should not be; they're pure information\nservice, even though ISPs also provide transmission. They\nprovide telecommunications. Information service -- excuse\nme -- Internet service does not work unless you have\ntransmission from wherever the telephone call goes into\nthe central office, and it has to be transmitted from\nthere to the Internet Service Provider's point of presence\non the Internet, and from there out onto the Internet.\nAnd Internet Service Providers either own or lease that\ntransmission capacity and offer that as part of the\nbundled offering that they make.\nSo every Internet Service Provider would be a\ntelecommunications carrier under their position, and that\nis contrary to what the FCC said before the '96 Act, and\nit's contrary to what Congress said in the 1996 Act. They\nsaid --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They claim that that's by\ntoleration of the FCC. I was going to ask them about\nthat, don't worry.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. HUNGAR: If I may reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Cappuccio, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. CAPPUCCIO\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-277\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nLet me begin by trying to answer Justice\nScalia's question. The question here, Justice, is, Are we\noffering two products, or are we offering two ingredients\nthat come together to form a separate product? And I\nwould submit that if you go back and read paragraph 120 of\nthe Computer II order, 1980, that's exactly what Congress\nsaid was happening. What Congress said is, when you take\n-- not Congress, I'm sorry; the FCC, of course -- when you\ntake the communications component and the data-processing\ncomponent and combine them, they are ingredients into what\nis a new offering, and a new and unregulated offering.\nThey said, \"We can't separate them. It's not useful to\ntry to separate them. And we view them as two\ningredients, forming a product that is a distinct\nproduct.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what is the\ndata-processing part?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: In the case of cable modem\nservice, Your Honor, it's a number of things. It's the\nability to, for example, retrieve information from a\nserver that somebody has on the Web --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I guess, on that one, if, in\nfact, you had a telephone system, and, at the other end of\nthe wire, Joe Smith, your friend, had recorded a message,\nand when you rang the call, the service simply picked up\nthe message and played it to you, wouldn't it still be a\ntelephone system?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Well, I think in your situation\n-- in the hypothetical you give, Your Honor, that would be\nsomebody using just a regular transmission-only path to\nhear what the other person --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how is this different?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Well, because here, in the\nexample that I used, for example -- it's certainly not the\nonly one -- it is the capacity to retrieve information\nthat is stored otherwise. And that follows, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Information that other people\nhave stored otherwise?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Yes. And not -- and not\nnecessarily --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't that even more\ntelecommunications than my answering service?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know, I pick up my\nmessages.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: -- I would say, Your Honor, for\none thing, it fits squarely within the definition of\ninformation service, which says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, of course it does,\nand so does my answering service.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I got -- what about the next\none? You were going to -- what I want to do is write down\na list --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of those things that are not\ntelecommunications.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: It's the ability to engage in --\nto use your e-mail, it's the ability --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the ability to engage or\nuse my e-mail is an ability to access messages that other\npeople, who don't work for you, have left for me. Now,\nagain, I keep thinking of my answering machine --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and it doesn't seem very\ndifferent.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, anyway, what's the third\none?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Well, it's anything that allows\nyou to browse the World Wide Web and to -- and to retrieve\ninformation from the World Wide Web.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, indeed.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it is, is a system where I\npick up the phone, and what my phone does is -- let's say\nit had the ability to survey a number of possible people\nwho wanted to talk to me. Would that suddenly change it\nfrom a phone to a computer or an information system?\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because the other people are\nleaving the information; it's not the phone that's doing\nit.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Your Honor, the ability to\nretrieve information that is stored somewhere out on a\nserver is not the raw transmission functionality. It is\nmore than that. It is what the Congress has said it is,\nit is the ability to retrieve information. It is not\nsimply sending bits over a line and having those bits not\nchanged and not interfered with. When you retrieve\nsomething from a server, you have to take it in form it is\non the server, you have to then put it through the\ntransmission system, and you have to reconvert it back\ninto what you want to see. It's an interactive process\nthat is more than just sending information.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rather like when I phone\nEurope, and they take the message and turn it into\nelectronic packets, and they send it all over the world\nand on computers and so forth, and it comes back to me\neventually, sounds a lot like my brother-in-law.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Yeah, I guess -- look, Your\nHonor, I am not disputing that an information service has\na component of it that's communications. It may, indeed,\nhave a component of it that's communication. But what the\nFCC said in Computer II is that when you combine the --\nyou combine the communications with, for example, the\ndata-retrieval function, that that combination of things\nis no longer the two separate products, it is a new\nenhanced service that is beyond Title II.\nAnd, Justice Scalia, part of the evidence that\nthese are not two separate products is, if they were, then\nCongress never could have said if enhanced services were\noutside of Title II. Computer II would have to be wrong\nand overruled, even though it's now 20 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The FCC --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Yeah, I'm sorry, I keep saying\nCongress; I meant the FCC.\nThe FCC could not have said that, because it\nwould have been forced -- if, as the theory goes, the\nenhanced service has in it the separate product of\ncommunications and has a separate status, then they\nwouldn't have been able to take it out of Computer II.\nBut let me suggest, stepping back for a second\n-- and, by the way, I should add that in this case, in the\nparagraph 39 of the order under -- below, the FCC said the\ntwo were not separable. Okay? I understand that to mean\nthey are ingredients intertwined, they are not separate\nproducts. But the basic thing that the agency did here\nwas to decide which of two things is happening. Are these\ntwo separate products? Is this communications and Chicken\nMcNuggets being bundled together? Or are these two\ningredients that are so interwoven, as they said in\nComputer II, as to form a distinct product? -- is a\nclassic example of what an agency does, and it's really\nnot one that this Court, I think, would be likely to\nsecondguess. It is, indeed, in fact --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- I mean, I think the\ndifficulty that we're having is that it says it in the\ncable context, and then it doesn't say it in the wire\ncontext. And you can say it just as intelligibly in the\nwire context.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Yeah.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's just that you haven't been\nsaying it.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Let me try to clarify that,\nJustice Souter. The reason why DSL meets the definition\nof \"telecommunications service\" and we don't is because\nthe telephone companies do, in fact, provide the\ntransmission-only component. Now, the reason they do\nthat, Justice Souter, is, as Mr. Hungar said, historical,\nthough it wasn't without basis in reasons in history, but\nthey do, in fact, provide it separately. They do, because\nCongress required them to do it through a separate\nsubsidiary in Computer II. There were reasons for that.\nThey wanted to avoid cross-subsidies, they were the only\nplatform, they were worried about discrimination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So is that really the nub of\nthe difference? It's Congress that is requiring them to\ndo it separately, and Congress doesn't have a comparable\nrequirement with respect to cable.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: I would -- I read the statute\nthis way. Congress takes the world as it comes. If you\nare providing it as a common carrier, then you fall within\n-- you're providing it separately -- then you fall within\nthe definition of \"telecommunications service.\" The DSL\nguys are. If you are not, and we are not, then you don't\nfall within --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but that begs the\nquestion.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Your Honor, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It begs the question.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: It just says that it's for\nsomeone else to decide the second prong of the NARUC test,\nwhich is, Should you be compelled? Okay? The Congress\ndoesn't decide that. It's crazy to think that Congress\ndecided, forever and ever and ever, that everybody who\ncame in would be a common carrier, no matter what the\nmarket looked like. Congress, instead, took the world as\nit came, and it relies on the FCC to decide whether you\nshould be compelled, under the second prong of NARUC, to\nbe a common carrier. They have declined, in this case, to\nextend that to us. That, I would say, is -- you know,\nthat's entitled to the utmost deference. It's a --\ndeciding not to extend their own rules. And there are\nperfectly fine reasons for that. The reasons that pushed\nthem to do it in 1980 to the telephone companies, about\ncross-subsidies, have no application to us. And the\ndiscrimination justifications back then, when there was\nonly one platform, had no application to us. Now, you may\nsay, Is this an odd result that it comes out differently\nat the end? Well, it is, and it is being dealt with. The\nFCC is in the process of reconsidering, in the wireline\norder, Wireline NPRM, whether it still makes sense to use\nComputer II to impose a common-carrier obligation, an\nobligation to do it separately, to provide the\ncommunications separately, on the telephone companies. If\nthey decide that no longer is the case and that they don't\nhave to provide it separately, and the telephone companies\nstop doing that, they will no longer fall within the\ndefinition of \"telecommunications service\" under the\nstatute.\nIn other words, the statute asks, What are you,\nin fact, doing? Okay? There are two ways you could be\nproviding it separately: if you choose to it or if you're\nforced to do it. We've done neither. The telephone\ncompanies have been forced to do it. Congress has -- and\nthey've decided we shouldn't be forced to do it, and\nthey're entitled to deference on that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Basically, you're saying\ninterstitial lawmaking, like other kinds of lawmaking, can\nbe reasonable without being absolutely consistent at a\ngiven moment.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That still doesn't explain --\nit still doesn't explain, to my satisfaction, why it\nbecomes a different product --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Okay, let me try --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a different product when\nyou're selling it separately, and it is not a different\nproduct when you're not selling it separately. I mean --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Because, Your Honor, it's\nwhether the words \"offering telecommunications\" are\nambiguous. If I -- if I bake cakes, and someone was to\nsay, \"If you offer cakes, you don't offer butter,\" there's\nnothing in the English language, Justice Scalia, that\nmakes that unreasonable, that a person who offers cakes to\nthe public does not offer butter to the public. And if\nyou believe that example is correct, then you have to\nuphold the FCC, because what it says is, the offer of the\nfinal product is not offering, to the public, the\ningredient.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you also sell butter.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Separately.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you sell butter --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: Separately.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- separately, then when you\nsell a cake --\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: But, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you're selling butter.\nMR. CAPPUCCIO: The ILECs do, we don't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nCappuccio.\nMr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Court will want to have handy, I think, the\nred brief of the Respondents Earthlink, et al., because I\nwill repeatedly take you to the text of the statute, which\nis reproduced at the appendix to that brief.\nMr. Chief Justice, cable modem service refers to\nthe bundled sale, purely for marketing reasons, of two\ndifferent things: highspeed telecommunications over cable\nwires, and computer software, like e-mail, that you can\naccess over that highspeed telecommunications. The\nCommission admits -- and it is a critical admission --\nthat the standalone sale of the telecommunications piece\nis a telecommunications service, notwithstanding that it\nis on cable wires rather than telephone wires. The Ninth\nCircuit correctly held that it makes no difference that\ncable companies market the telecommunications with e-mail\nand the like.\nCongress cannot have intended to empower\ncarriers to deregulate themselves through the nicety of\nadding some further feature to their common carriage. And\nI think we can demonstrate that through the text of the\nstatute. I'd like to take you to two provisions at the\noutset.\nThe first one is on 2a of the appendix, and it\ngoes, Justice Souter, to the question of whether there's\nsome difference that Congress has adopted between\ntelephone wires and cable wires. And the answer to that\nquestion is, no. Subparagraph 46, the definition of\n\"telecommunications service,\" this is the provision that\nleads to common-carrier regulation. The term\n\"telecommunications service\" means \"the offering of\ntelecommunications for a fee directly to the public or to\nsuch classes of users as to be effectively available\ndirectly to the public\" -- and here is the critical clause\n-- \"regardless of the facilities used.\" Congress made\nquite clear it was not drawing any distinction based on\ncable wire versus telephone.\nI'd like to point you to two other provisions.\nThey are not reproduced, because they're in the cable --\nseparate cable provisions, but they will be relevant to\nyour question. That is 47 USC 541(d) and 522. Those\nspecifically contemplate that cable companies will be\ncommon carriers. Now, that's the answer to the question,\nIs there a difference between a cable wire and a telephone\nwire?\nLet me now step back to what the FCC said in its\nruling. The FCC backed into its decision here, and it\nwill turn on the definition of \"information service,\"\nwhich will be on 1a of the appendix. It said this. Look,\ncable modem service fits within the definition of an\n\"information service.\" It's this bundled thing. And we\nconstrue the definition of an \"information service\" to be\nmutually exclusive of a telecommunications service. And\nthat is legal error. And let me take you through the\ndefinition.\nSubparagraph 20, information service. The term\n\"information service\" means the offering of a capability\nfor, in a variety of things -- generating, acquiring,\nstoring, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing,\nor making available information -- via telecommunications.\nThat is not language of exclusivity; it is language of\ndependence. There has to be telecommunications involved.\nIf you all came to the court today via car, or I came via\nmetro, there was a car or a train involved.\nNow, I want to contrast that with another series\nof statutory provisions. And what these provisions do is\ndemonstrate, beyond peradventure, that Congress address\nthe problem you are now facing. It said, \"We recognize\nthat there are definitional provisions that might\notherwise fall within the definition of 'common carriage.'\nAnd if we don't want it to be a common carrier, we will\ntell you expressly.\"\nThere are four of them. They are reproduced.\nAgain at 1A, the definition of a \"common carrier.\" It's\nthe exclusion that appears at the bottom of the\ndefinition, three lines from the bottom, \"But a person\nengaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such\nperson is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier.\"\nThere's nothing like that for \"information services.\"\nThere's going to be one specific table that I think will\nbe particularly illustrative.\nThe next one, the definition of a\n\"telecommunications carrier.\" It's at 2a. There's a\nspecific exclusion. Telecommunications carrier, these are\nthe people that are common carriers. The term\n\"telecommunications carrier\" means \"any provider of\ntelecommunications services except\" -- so Congress drew\nthis out -- \"except that such term does not include\naggregators of telecommunications services.\"\nThe next two, and they are the final two, are at\n8a, one that deals with private mobile services -- it's\ndenoted subparagraph 2 -- \"A person engaged in the\nprovision of a service that is a private mobile service\nshall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be\ntreated as a common carrier for any purposes under this\nAct.\" There's a definitional category of \"private mobile\nservice.\" We don't want it to be common carriage.\nAnd the final one is the cable one, and I think\nit's very illustrative -- right below that, subparagraph c\n-- \"Any cable system shall not be subject to regulation as\na common carrier or utility by reason of providing any\ncable service.\" Nothing at all about an information\nservice.\nJustice Scalia, you are quite right, this is a\ncase about a statute, and the language has none of the\nindications that the Commission is relying on here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it does have this, that\nwhat -- if you look at the definition of\n\"telecommunications,\" it means \"transmitting information\nwithout change in the form or content of the information.\"\nNow, in respect to some of their services -- not, maybe, a\nlot, but in response to some -- they certainly change the\ncontent and the form. E-mail, for example, does. And\nthere are a number of others that do. So the language,\nsays the FCC -- I look to \"telecommunications service.\"\nThey provide telecommunications service sometimes, and\nsometimes this other thing, as well, and it's all bundled.\nAnd we read the word \"offering\" to mean \"offering\nseparately.\" And so, therefore, a person who offers only\na bundled service is not a person who's offering a\ntelecommunications service. That's how I read it, as\ntrying to understand their argument. And it seemed to me\nthat argument is logical, and it fits the language.\nNow, why is it -- are -- do you agree that it is\nlogical and fits the language, and at least get them that\nfar, or not?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: All right, let me take you\nthrough both parts. Telecommunications -- we're going to\ntalk about the definition of \"telecommunications\" and what\nit is to \"offer.\"\nThey are wrong in suggesting that there is not\ntelecommunications here, and I can prove it two ways. The\nfirst is, remember, \"telecommunications\" is the phrase in\nthe definition of \"information service,\" as well. Let me\ntake you back to it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: (Inaudible)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: \"Information service\" -- I\napologize -- is at 1a. The term \"information service\"\nmeans \"the offering of a capability for (inaudible) via\ntelecommunications.\" They're categorizing this thing as\nan information service, so they have to be acknowledging\nthere's telecommunications involved. So, obviously, cable\nmodem service --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, but they're saying if\ntelecommunications and something else is involved, and\nthat's what you offer, you are not offering a\ntelecommunications service. That's their definition of\n\"offer,\" as \"offer telecommunications service separately.\"\nIt would be obvious, for example, if you service were by\nphone, to connect with the Library of Congress and you\nowned the Library of Congress, as well as owning the\ndedicated line. Then what you're doing is selling\ninformation across the line. So they say that's what\nthey're doing, but just not as much.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me explain why I answered\nthem separately. Because the Commission's argument -- if\nthis -- Chenery -- you have to review a Commission\ndecision -- the Commission's argument was that there was\nno telecommunications involved. This is a different\nargument from the fact that there is no offering. That\nappears in the Solicitor General's reply brief. So I\nwanted to bracket, set aside. It says, \"That can't be\nright. The Commission is ruling based on a pure legal\nerror.\"\nLet me turn to \"offering.\" We're the only ones\nthat have provided a straightforward dictionary definition\nof \"offering.\" An \"offering\" is to make something\navailable. And you say, \"All right, is the bundle making\navailable the telecommunications?\" The answer to that\nquestion is, yes. At the very least, it's yes in the\ncontext of this statute, which is a common-carriage\nstatute.\nImagine the following hypotheticals, Justice\nBreyer. Pick any form of common carriage you want. If\nsomeone said, \"I'm not just giving you the railroad\nbridge, but I'm also selling you -- you have to buy from\nme the train that's running on it and the grain that's in\nthe train.\" You couldn't avoid common carriage by forcing\nyour customers to buy the unified package together.\nThe second point is that, remember, the great,\ngreat, great majority of communications have nothing to do\nwith their information services. I have cable modem\nservice. Lots of people do. What do I do? I get up in\nthe morning, and I go to newyorktimes.com, I go to\nsupremecourtus.gov. You'll be pleased. I --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And that has nothing to do with\nwhat they're offering. I have cable modem service. I\ndon't use the e-mail program that's offered to me by Star\nPower. I have my own e-mail program. It's true, they've\ngiven me some extra stuff, but one thing that you know for\nsure is that doesn't deny that they have given me,\nfundamentally, the capability to send the information back\nand forth. Nothing changes. And I can illustrate this\nfor you.\nRemember the concession that I started with.\nThey admit that if they sell it alone, then that's a\ntelecommunications service. They say it makes it\ndifferent -- a difference that you market them together.\nBut if I get one bill for that or two bills for that, it\nworks just the same. I send the information back and\nforth, over and over again. There is absolutely no\ndifference.\nNow, Justice Souter, I want to come back to\nhistory, because that's -- seems to me the leg that they\nhope that they have to stand on. I certainly don't think\nthey have a textual leg to stand on. Let me make some\npoints about the history.\nThe context for this is the Computer Inquiries\nand the modified final judgement under AT&T, and they are\nsimply misdescribing the history. And I will take you to\nthe actual quotes for what happened.\nFirst, let me take you to the definition of a\n\"basic service\" and an \"enhanced service\" under the\nComputer Inquiries, and that is reproduced at 23 of our\nbrief. And the point I'm going to make through this is --\nwhat the Commission said over and over and over again\nunder the Computer Inquiries -- is this, if you have a\ntelecommunications piece, we're going to call it a \"basic\nservice.\" If you add information processing on top of\nthat, we're going to call the whole thing an \"enhanced\nservice.\" So far, everybody's on the same page.\nBut the piece that they're leaving out is that\nthey made different decisions, policy decisions, Justice\nScalia, about how, ultimately, to regulate them, but the\ndefinition never changed. If you added the enhancement on\nit, just like you add the e-mail on top of it, you still\nhad the basic service.\nSo here's the quote. It's at 23 of our brief.\n\"We find that basic service is limited to the common-\ncarrier offering\" -- they're picking -- Congress is\npicking up precisely the words in the Computer Inquiries\n-- \"of transmission capacity for the movement of\ninformation; whereas, enhanced service combines basic\nservice with computer-processing applications.\" The basic\nservice remained.\nAnd then the Commission and the D.C. Circuit\nconfronted just the problem you are. What happened is\nthat providers, under the Computer Inquiries and under the\nmodified final judgement, tried to combine the two things\nand say, \"We're no longer regulated.\" They said, \"Yeah, I\nknow we had telecommunications, but now we want to add\nsomething onto it.\" And I can take you to what the courts\nsaid and what the Commission said, and that is at pages 24\nto 25. And I think it's exactly what Congress would think\nif it were confronted with this problem under the plain\ndefinitions.\nThe second block quote on 24. This is when the\nCommission was confronted with this problem. It said that\nthe argument that they're accepting now would allow\ncircumvention of the Computer II and Computer III basic\nenhanced framework. AT&T would be able to avoid Computer\nII and Computer III, unbundling --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, can't the\nCommission change its mind, Mr. Goldstein?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, on this\nquestion, the answer is, no, because Mr. Hungar has\nconceded, and the Commission conceded below, that Congress\nwas adopting a definitional framework. I agree, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that the Commission can change its policy\njudgement about how it wants to regulate within the\ndefinitional framework that Congress adopted. So you've\npointed me to a critical point, and that is to reinforce\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, I'm glad I did.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- and that is to reinforce\nthis. Our position is that the Computer Inquiries and the\nAT&T MFJ had definitions: What's a basic service? What's\nan enhanced service? Congress adopted those for the\npurposes of the definition of a \"telecommunications\nservice\" and an \"information service.\"\nNow, you can make policy judgements about how to\nregulate, although you're going to have to do it under the\nforbearance regime adopted in a response to Justice\nScalia's opinion for the Court in MCI. But, nonetheless,\nthe definitions are what they are. This is a statute\nthat's being interpreted.\nSo, let me come back. So, what did the\nCommission say under those definitions? AT&T would be\nable to avoid Computer II and Computer III unbundling and\ntariff requirements for any basic service that it could\ncombine with an enhanced service. You know, we've got the\ntelecommunications, like we're going to tack e-mail onto\nit. This is obviously an undesirable and unintended\nresult.\nThe D.C. Circuit, faced with precisely the same\nquestion under the framework that Congress intended to\nadopt, that is on the next page, on page 25, right below\nthe block quote. The block quote sets up the problem.\nThe D.C. Circuit, however, rejected that conclusion, the\none that's being proposed here by the Commission, as a\nstrained interpretation of the language of the decree that\ncould not have been intended because it would allow the\nBOCs to, quote, \"create an enormous loophole\" in the core\nrestriction of the decree.\nSo, Justice O'Connor, this comes back to your\npoint in the first half of the argument, and that is, it\nbecomes completely circular. If the point is that you\nwill only be subject to common-carrier regulation when you\ndecide to provide telecommunications service, nobody ever\nwill. Everybody will always bundle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but they say we have the\nauthority, if they -- if there is a bundled service, by\nlooking at the competitive necessity, market power, the\nneed to protect consumers, to insist that an offeror of\nbundled service split the bundle and then be regulated.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I agree. There are five\n(inaudible) where the Solicitor General, sort of, pulls\nthe ripcord here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: First, they have a Chenery\nproblem; and that is, this doesn't appear anywhere in the\nCommission's ruling. What they said in the Commission's\nruling is that they could take a Title I information\nservice and regulate it as common carriage. This is an\nentirely different animal. This is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but they're replying to\nyour argument, and they're saying it's really not right\nthat this means no regulation. And the reason it means no\nregulation is because they've long had the authority to do\nthis, and then they cite some references where that is\npretty much what the Commission said.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I still this is covered by\nChenery, but let's go to that. And so, here's the\nproposition. The proposition is that the Commission has\nthe untethered authority to force someone to provide a\ntelecommunications service. And my question back to the\nother side is, Where in the world in the statute is that?\nThere is no textural foundation for it whatsoever.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you take them as\nhaving a broad -- if you take the statute as throwing this\nwhole problem in the lap of the Commission --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and then you say they have\nauthority, broadly, to interpret this term \"offer,\" they\ncould give functional reasons, as in some circumstances,\nto interpret the word \"offer\" to mean \"offer\ntelecommunications separately,\" and, in other\ncircumstances, because they're functional differences, to\ntake a different position. Now, either they do or they\ndon't. If they don't, they're being inconsistent, and\nthat's the subject of a different legal proceeding. If\nthey do, so be it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me deal with the premise\nthat Congress threw this into the lap of the FCC, and also\nhow it is they propose to deal with it, on that\nassumption. The answer is, they did not throw it into the\nlap of the FCC. The '96 Act enacted these definitions,\nwhich are very carefully calibrated, for which there is no\ntext -- textual support. I will come back to \"offering.\"\nBut Congress did enact a specific provision in MCI versus\nAT&T. It addressed not only the concern of the majority,\nbut also the concerns of the dissenters, that the\nCommission needed some flexibility. And it told the\nCommission how to address this problem. It said, in the\nforbearance procedures, \"Here are the rules that you will\napply in deciding to lift regulation.\" They're quite\ndetailed. They're -- now, let me take you to them again\n-- they're at the end of our -- I'm sorry, they are at --\nin our appendix, at 3a. This is what Congress said.\nCongress said, \"We recognize the Commission needs some\nflexibility, but there are going to be rules, and there\nare going to be rules so courts can, for example, review,\nlater on, whether or not you're actually applying what we\n-- doing what you want -- what we wanted you to do.\"\nAnd here's what the Commission has to do,\naccording to Congress. And it's what the Commission did\nnot do here. I'm going to start with the indented\nparagraphs, 1, 2, and 3, and then subparagraph b. It told\nthe Commission to look at whether or not the former\nregulation is not necessary to ensure that the charges --\nand skipping again -- are just and reasonable and are not\nunjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Paragraph 2,\nthey have to make sure it's not necessary for the\nprotection of consumers, that it's in the public interest,\nand that the competitive effects will be positive rather\nthan negative. The Commission did none of this,\nnotwithstanding that Congress specifically directed them\nto.\nNow, let me then turn to the question of whether\nor not this is a reasonable interpretation of \"offering.\"\nNow, in different contexts, I admit, it's conceivable to\ncome up with different meanings of \"offerings,\" but this\nis a context, and I think if you take any example where\nCongress actually -- I've given you the common carrier. I\ndon't think the railroad could ever get away with saying\nit. I gave you the examples of the Computer Inquiries and\nthe AT&T MFJ, which are on point. But take anything that\nCongress regulates. Take, for example, the fact that we\nregulate offering of cigarettes to children. Now, a\nmerchandiser couldn't come along and say, \"I'm not\noffering cigarettes. What I've done is, I've created a\nsmoking service. I've taken the cigarettes, and I've put\na lighter in it, and you've just got one bill that you\nhave to pay for it.\" The idea that that would evade what\nCongress is concerned about is loopy.\nThink about what Congress is concerned about\nwith common-carriage regulations. There are three\nprincipal consequences to being a telecommunications\nservice. And imagine if any of them changed a whit,\nexcept to favor us, when you bundle the e-mail with it.\nFirst, nondiscrimination. Would Congress want\nyou to have to charge just and reasonable rates to a\ncompetitor any less when you're selling e-mail with the\ntelecommunications than the telecommunications alone? No.\nInterconnection. Would Congress want a cable\nmodem service network to be less interconnected with all\nthe other networks simply because it has e-mail or a Web\nbrowser on it? I don't know why, I suppose Congress would\nwant to be more sure, because there are more messages.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the Congress\napparently wanted to go in the direction of deregulation\nhere.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a\nfair point, and it is basically -- aside for the, sort of,\nnod at history, it -- Mr. Hungar started with that. And\nour point is that Congress told them how to deregulate,\nand that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about Congress\nthinking, quite honestly, if they -- people do think about\nit. I have no idea how broadband service will be provided\n20 years from now. There may be a thousand competitors.\nThere may be wireless. People may be broadcasting it\nthrough their teeth. I don't know --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what it's going to be. But\nsince I don't know and have really no idea whether it\nshould or should not be regulated, because I don't know\nthe competitive situation, let's leave it up to the FCC.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It did that, but with a critical\nconcession. It said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It sort of it did that in\nbroadcasting, didn't it? I guess they could have written\nit to say that \"the FCC shall regulate common-carrier\ncommunications in the public interest, convenience, and\nnecessity,\" which would put the FCC in the same situation\nwith regard to this, as it's in with regard to\nbroadcasting.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think it's a very fair\ncomparison. But also, Justice Breyer, I think -- you\nknow, I think we're all on the same page about what\nCongress intended, and that is, first of all, Congress was\naware of cable modem service. That's said expressly in\nthe Court's opinion in Gulf Power. It was emphasized by\nthe cable industry in Gulf Power itself. There is --\nthere are several statutory provisions that refer to cable\ncompanies being common carriage. But, Justice Breyer,\nwhat they said is this, \"We have broad encompassing\ndefinitions, and that is, it's not going to make a\ndifference if you combine two things together. But,\nCommission, you go make those\" -- Justice Breyer, all the\nfindings you're talking about are listed in the section 10\nforbearance proceedings.\nNow, imagine the world as the Commission sees\nit. It says that forbearance applies to\ntelecommunications service. But when it comes to things\nthat aren't telecommunications service, it's \"Katie bar\nthe door.\" We don't have any rules. What kind of logical\nregulatory scheme is that? And that is that the\nCommission is constrained with respect to its expertise.\nBut things that are information services that are outside\ntelecommunications, it can do whatever it wants.\nJustice Breyer, I did want to make one\nadditional point, and that is, again, there is a statutory\nprovision here that addresses their claim that they can\nforce you to provide telecommunications service, and that\nis the definition of a \"telecommunications carrier.\" And\nit is on 2a. I read the exception, so now I'm dealing\nwith the second sentence of the definition, \"A\ntelecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common\ncarrier under this Act only to the extent that it is\nengaged in providing telecommunications services.\"\nThis lines up perfectly with this Court's\ndecision in Midwest Video. There was a constraint on what\nit -- what regulation you could impose on broadcasters.\nThis one says, \"You are only going to be a common carrier\nif you're providing a telecommunications service.\" But\nthe FCC has this vision that it can, sort of, solve all\nthe problems through its raw discretion and to force\nsomeone to provide common carriage. But the statute's\nvery clear, if you are not providing a telecommunications\nservice, you are not going to be a telecommunications\ncarrier; and, therefore, you are not going to be providing\ncommon carriage.\nAnd, as I've said, I don't understand how it is,\neven if one looked at this particular context, you could\ndecide that Congress thought the bundle made regulation\nless regulated -- less necessary, rather than more\nregulated -- more necessary.\nI want, next, if I could, to talk about the\nnotion that you can self-deregulate, and how utterly\nimplausible this is, how is it that the Commission could\nimagine that Congress created the following regime. And\nthat is, if you want to provide common carriage, you'll be\nsubject to this regulation; but if you don't feel like it,\nwell, that's okay. That will render the definition of\n\"telecommunications service\" -- if you just want to tack\ne-mail onto the thing, that will render the definition of\n\"telecommunications service\" -- in the Internet, you're a\ndead letter, because who in the world would ever do it?\nIf it's up to the regulated entity, why in the world would\nanyone provide common carriage?\nI think this has, actually, a remarkable\nparallel to the Court's decision in the Oneida Indian\nNation case, where the Court rejected the suggestion that\nwhat you could do is -- that it would be up to the Indians\nto decide whether or not they would be able to get\nproperty back. This is what the Court said, \"If OIN may\nunilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove those\nparcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent the\ntribe from initiating a new generation of litigation to\nfree the parcels\" -- remember, they're free from all\nregulation at all -- \"free the parcels from land zone --\nlocal zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all\nlandowners in the area.\"\nAnd then, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion goes on\nto talk about section 465, which is exactly like section\n10 forbearance, \"Recognizing these practical concerns,\nCongress has provided a mechanism for the acquisition of\nthe lands. The regulations implementing section 465 are\nsensitive to the complex interjurisdictional concerns that\narise when the tribe seeks to retain -- regain sovereign\ncontrol over territory. The Secretary must consider\" --\nand it lists a whole series of things.\nAnd the parallel, I think, is exact. You can't\nhave Congress enacting a scheme that tells you how to do\nit.\nNow, let me return to, then, Mr. Cappuccio's\nsuggestion, Justice Scalia, that this is an ingredient,\nit's not a product. The straightforward answer is,\nthere's no mention of ingredients or products in the\nstatute. It says \"telecommunications service.\" And the\nquestion under the definition of \"telecommunications\nservice\" is, Are you providing telecommunications? Yeah,\nthe information's going back and forth. Is it to the\npublic? Sure, anybody can buy it. Is there a fee? You\nbet, it's kind of expensive, actually. And that's all\nthat Congress cared about.\nNow, this is not a question of whether or not\nthere's butter in a cake, because you -- it -- there are\ntwo reasons. The first is, fundamentally, the\ntelecommunications is the same; it hasn't been \"cooked\"\ninto something else. And the second --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's butter on the cake, not\nin the cake.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nThe second is, the reason all those\nhypotheticals are -- wheels and cars and those sorts of\nthings -- don't make any sense here is that they assume a\nfew things. The first is, they're assuming a first sale\nthat gets regulated. Somebody buys the butter, somebody\nbuys the tires and gets regulated. But under their rules\nit's never regulated at all. The telecommunications just,\npoof, escapes all regulation. And the second is that, in\nthe car example, it's because there's -- the reason it has\nintuitive appeal is that there's a regulatory scheme about\ncars. So Congress has decided how all the inputs will be\nregulated together.\nBut, again, remember the consequence of sticking\nthis into the unregulated \"information services\" box is,\nit's all gone. There's no regulation of it whatsoever.\nIt's just not a scheme that makes any sense.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nGoldstein.\nMr. Hungar, you have four minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-281\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nTurning first to the question of the regulatory\nhistory, Respondents continue to rely on the fact that,\nunder Computer II, the FCC required telephone common\ncarriers to separate out and separately offer the basic\ntransmission component. But, importantly, and what\nrefutes Respondent's attempts to rely on history, Congress\ndid not -- excuse me -- the FCC did not impose that\nrequirement on enhanced service providers. There were\nentities called \"value-added networks\" that obtained the\ntelecommunications functionality, bundled it together with\ninformation servicing protocol conversion-type computer\nfunctions, and offered that bundled service as an enhanced\nservice. And the Commission said, in Computer II, \"That\nis an unregulated enhanced-service offering, it is not\nsubject to Title II of the Act, because we don't think\nCongress intended Title II, which is aimed at traditional\ntelephone communications, to deal with this new form of\nintermingled integrated service.\" It is not regulated,\neven though it is true that there was a communications\ncomponent. And, under Respondent's rationale, that offer\nor that value-added network should have been required to\nmake it file a tariff and comply with all the regulations\nof Title II of the Act. And footnote 5 of our reply brief\ncites the orders discussing this fact.\nAnd in addition, under Computer II, the\nCommission required AT&T and, later, the Regional Bell\nOperating Companies, if they were going to offer enhanced\nservices, to offer them separately through subsidiaries,\nunregulated subsidiaries, even though they were offering\nbundles of enhanced service and telecommunications, the\ntelecommunications, which they obtained under tariff from\ntheir parent corporation. But the entire bundled offering\nwas unregulated. And that's been true for 25 years.\nAnd, again, Congress, in 1996, gave no\nindication that it was overturning this well-established\nsituation in which enhanced services, now information\nservices, were not regulated. And to suggest that\nCongress, in an act that talks about preserving the hands-\noff approach to the Internet, in fact, regulated all\nInternet Service Providers in a way that they had never\nbeen regulated before, we submit, is certainly an unlikely\ninterpretation of the act, and clearly demonstrates that\nthe FCC was reasonable in rejecting that position.\nJustice Breyer, you asked about voicemail or\nsimilar type systems that would preserve a message. If\nprovided by a computer functionality, that service is an\ninformation service. Voicemail is an information service.\nBut the FCC has at least suggested that voicemail and\nbasic telecommunications -- if a telephone company tried\nto offer it -- say, \"We're going to offer this bundled,\nand we don't think it's regulated,\" telephone companies\ntry that sort of thing from time to time, and then the FCC\nis faced with a decision, in its discretion, of whether\nthat should be viewed as an integrated offering or,\ninstead, as really two things that have just been added\ntogether but aren't really -- that are really two distinct\nservices. And the FCC has suggested, in that context,\nthat telephone service and voicemail service, even if\nthey're bundled together, are two distinct services.\nAnd there's an important difference, I think,\nbetween that type of offering and the one here. You can\nuse your -- even if your telephone company offers you\nvoicemail, obviously, you -- a lot of your use of the\ntelephone system has nothing to do with the voicemail;\nit's pure telephony, pure telecommunications; whereas,\nwith cable modem service, every time you use it,\nessentially, you are utilizing at least some of the data-\nprocessing, computer-enhanced functionality that is being\nprovided by your -- by your Internet Service Provider --\nthe domain-name system, as we discussed, caching. For\ninstance, Mr. Goldstein says he goes to supremecourtus.gov\nevery morning. I suspect he doesn't actually go to this\nCourt's computer. He probably gets at least the first\npage off of the cache, which provided by the ISP.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\n"
