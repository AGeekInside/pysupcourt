Kevin Concannon, et al.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nUnder 42 U.S.C. section 1396a, in subsection\n(a)(19), which is found on page 244 of the joint appendix,\nCongress made absolutely clear, as a singular precondition\nof all Medicaid plans, that they must assure that care and\nservices will be provided in a manner consistent with\nsimplicity of administration and the best interests of the\nrecipients. This statute does not allow Maine to use\nMedicaid recipients as pawns in its effort to reduce\nhealth care costs for those individuals who are not\neligible for Medicaid.\nQUESTION: Was this statute -- was the statute\ndiscussed in the First Circuit opinion?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The Medicaid statute?\nQUESTION: The -- the provision you just read.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, absolutely, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, that -- that provision\nis -- is in the portion of the statute dealing with the\napproval of the State plan, a State plan has to have that\nconsequence. It has to serve the interest of the Medicaid\nrecipients.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's true, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: It doesn't say that each -- each --\neach feature enacted by a State has to be judged\nindividually under that standard. It seems to me, why\nisn't it the case that if -- if a State adopts some\nprovision which does not comply with that provision, its\nplan is no longer a conforming plan, and the Secretary has\nexplicit authority under the statute to -- to repeal the\nSecretary's prior approval of the plan. Why isn't that\nthe way this thing should work?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the way this operates is\nthat this is not adopted as a part of the State's plan\nthat's subjected to review by the Secretary of HHS. What\nthis is, is a completely separate program that's been\nadopted independently, and all it does is reach out and\nhold the recipients of Medicaid as hostages in order to\nextract money from out-of-state manufacturers --\nQUESTION: Yes, but do you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- but it's not a part of the\nplan.\nQUESTION: -- but is it -- is it the case, if we\nwere to, let's suppose, affirm here, that the Health &\nHuman Services head could nonetheless call a halt to it\nand say, you no longer conform with our understanding of\nwhat's required, you're holding hostage our Medicaid\nrecipients and it's having a negative effect on them\nbecause of the prior approval requirements of drugs that\notherwise wouldn't be required? Is -- would -- would the\nSecretary have that power?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I believe the Secretary might\nhave that power, although I would ask you to ask\nMr. Kneedler when -- when he's arguing.\nQUESTION: Well, I probably will.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But over and above that, that\ndoesn't -- but that's not an exclusive remedy, that's all.\nQUESTION: But how can the authorization\nprovision and the requirements attached to the\nauthorization provision, how can that conceivably not be\npart of the State plan, as you say? I mean, it seems to\nme it's central to the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean --\nQUESTION: -- there's an authorization --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- there's a -- there's a\nformalistic way of looking at it, which is that they have\na State plan, and this is not incorporated as part of the\nState plan. What this has been -- what has been done here\nis to adopt a completely separate program which simply\nreaches out, as I said before, and seeks to hold hostage\ncertain elements of it.\nQUESTION: But if you take that position, the\nState plan could be rendered meaningless. I mean, the\nState plan simply becomes a kind of formal Open Sesame.\nThe -- there's got to be power to look, as\nJustice Scalia suggests, or the State plan means nothing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, there has to be a State\nplan. The question is whether or not (a)(19) reflects\ncongressional intent that the State has to act in a\nparticular way.\nquestion then is, are there multiple remedies available to\nrespond to it?\nI think, Justice O'Connor, the answer to your\nquestion is yes. I think the Secretary does have that\nauthority to go forward, although I would ask\nMr. Kneedler --\nQUESTION: Can I ask this question: Could the\nState, if it just -- without adopting a Maine Rx program,\njust decide, we want to take a good, hard look at every\nsale of drugs that comes into our State, so we're going to\nsubject every drug manufacturer to prior approval pursuant\nto 1396r-8(d), could they do that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- there's an open question as\nto whether they could do that. Certainly, if you take the\nmost expansive reading of 1396r-8(d) you could make that\nargument. The alternative argument would be to what\nextent that that violates or interferes with the formulary\nformulations that are embedded in the statute.\nQUESTION: But if they do have that authority,\nand you say that's an open question, doesn't it follow, a\nfortiori, that they can do what they're doing here?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, it doesn't follow a fortiori,\nbecause what they're doing here is imposing the prior\nauthorization with respect to, you know, to serve purposes\nthat are completely unrelated to the Medicaid program.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe my hypothetical was\ncompletely unrelated. They just want to be sure you can\nopen the caps on the drug containers, or whatever it might\nbe, some idiocentric -- I don't think that the -- as I\nread it, I don't see anything in that provision that says\nit must serve a Medicaid purpose.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you'd have to read\nthat provision in the context of the entirety of the\nprovision providing for coverage of drugs, and I think you\nhave to do it in that context, and I think there are\nbroader issues there, but the singular problem here,\nobviously, is that if you interpret the statute as broadly\nas the State of Maine does to say that we can impose prior\nauthorization requirements, then what they can say is, we\nwant to extract money from manufacturers solely for the\npurpose of building schools or roads or anything else that\nwe want to, and there's no restriction on that, and it\nseems to me that if what you're saying is you want to have\nprior authorization as a mechanism to deal within\nMedicaid, to provide generally for a balance of interest\nbetween Medicaid recipients, that's one thing.\nBut what -- what -- what Maine is doing is using\nMedicaid recipients to further completely unrelated\npurposes of the State, then it seems to me what you've\ndone is essentially ask the Federal Government to\nsubsidize a program that -- that's not an appropriate one\nto subsidize.\nQUESTION: Okay, what about the halfway measure,\nand the halfway measure has been described by the\nGovernment as -- as some instances of prior approval that,\nthat it would authorize that go beyond what the -- the --\nthe -- the very strict enforcement of Medicaid in a\nlimited sense would require. Do you think what the\nGovernment has -- excuse me. Do you think what the\nGovernment has suggested is also beyond the authorization\nof the statute?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it is. I think the\nbetter way to read the statute is to recognize that this\nis designed to benefit Medicaid recipients, and the\nproblem is, once you get past programs that are designed\nto benefit recipients themselves, it's very difficult to\nsee where you draw the line after that in terms of where\nit goes.\nQUESTION: Well, is it correct that the\nSecretary has approved a few plans in other States that do\ngo beyond, technically, the direct Medicaid recipients,\nfor instance, the people who are very close to the line\nand might well become eligible soon?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice O'Connor, that is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Those programs are in litigation\nas we stand here --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- as I stand here today, and --\nQUESTION: Is that possible -- I mean, as I'm\nseeing this at the moment, if the State uses the\nauthorization program for any purpose at all, we know that\nsome -- that some Medicaid recipients will be hurt.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nQUESTION: If a Medicaid recipient walks into a\ndrugstore and asks for drug X, that recipient can get it\nmore easily if it's not on this prior approval list than\nif it is, and that being so, it must be impermissible\nunder Federal law, unless the object of the program\nachieves a Medicaid-related purpose, so the question in\nfront of us is, does it?\nNow, what's bothering me about that is that the\nSecretary thinks some programs like Maine's are okay, and\nothers maybe not.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nQUESTION: So in my mind the words, primary\njurisdiction, suddenly flash red. How can I decide this\ncase without knowing what the Secretary thinks, and how\ncan -- I mean, after all, if the Secretary says this one\nis okay, that would have a big leg up under Chevron, and\nif the Secretary says no, it wouldn't, so why isn't the\ncorrect principle primary jurisdiction, which we can apply\nwhether the parties like it or not, and why isn't the\ncorrect result here to send it back to the district court\nand say, district court, Maine cannot put this into effect\nuntil they ask the Secretary about it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't have any particular\nproblem with sending it back to the district court\nenjoined subject to approval by the Secretary of HHS, I\nmean, if that's the way the Court wanted to resolve this\ncase.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm really -- that's not what I\nwant. I want to have --\nQUESTION: Is that the way primary jurisdiction\nworks? I thought there has to be in place some mechanism\nfor getting the agency to pass upon the question, a\nmechanism that the person who is dismissed from Federal\ncourt is entitled to use, and I'm not sure that exists\nhere.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know, Justice Scalia,\nthat you need to be dismissing it from Federal court. I\nthink it's quite possible for the --\nQUESTION: Well, even if you sit on it until\nit's done --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, stay your hand pending --\nQUESTION: -- you still have to assure that\nthere's some -- some mechanism. I mean, all the primary\njurisdiction cases I know of, there -- there was a means\nto file a case before the agency.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't disagree with that,\nJustice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Well, I disagree with it, so we'll\nhave to work it out.\nQUESTION: You can't just send them off and say,\nyou know, ask the Secretary, by the way, and have the\nSecretary write us a letter. I don't know that we've ever\ndone that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure that there\nisn't a mechanism for asking the -- to petition the\nSecretary for review. I think if Maine wanted to get\napproval of this particular program, it certainly had it\navailable to do that. It didn't seek that particular\ncourse.\nAnd Justice Breyer, I think it's important, in\nthe context of trying to figure out primary jurisdiction,\nwe know the views of the United States with respect to\nthis particular program. There may be other programs, as\nJustice O'Connor identified, that come close to the line\nwhere the Secretary would have a different view, and I\nthink it's appropriate in --\nQUESTION: Is their views the Secretary's view?\nQUESTION: That's what I --\nQUESTION: I'll -- fine, I'll ask them.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I believe it is the Secretary's\nview, but --\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, as I understand your\nposition, so long as it benefits Medicaid recipients, any\n-- any authorization scheme is okay? I mean, a State can\nsay, we'll authorize your drug if you pay $5 to each\nMedicaid recipient?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is not my position. My\nbasic position is that the Court doesn't need to figure\nout precisely what prior authorizations are permissible in\norder to decide this case, because the one thing that\nshould be absolutely clear is, you cannot use this\nmechanism in a Federal program in order to disadvantage\nthe primary recipients of that program without serving any\nMedicaid, sort of, related purpose.\nQUESTION: You -- you -- you may be up in a --\nin a later case arguing that the -- that the reasonable\nreading of the authorization requirement is -- is to\nassure the safety of the drug, or the necessity of the\ndrug for the particular illness?\nMR. PHILLIPS:\ncorrect, Justice Scalia. We'd -- we -- I mean, I think we\nwould take that position, and that we -- that you cannot\nread (d)(1) completely in isolation, and -- and to the\nfullest extent of the language of that, without regard to\nthe rest of the provisions of (d)(1) through (d)(6), and\nyou -- and for sure, you cannot read them without regard\nto the more fundamental requirement in subsection (a) and\n(a)(19), that the primary consideration must be the\nbeneficiaries of this program.\nThey are the most needy people in our country,\nand the notion that you use them as a mechanism for trying\nto simply lower health care costs for the Steven Kings of\nthe world strikes me as -- as an outrageous position for\nthe State of Maine to take.\nQUESTION: No, but they may not be doing that.\nThey may think that the object of this is to lower the\nhealth care costs for the moderately poor not yet on\nMedicaid, and thereby prevent people from falling into the\nMedicaid category.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, that would be a\npersuasive argument if this statute had any kind of a\ntailoring mechanism to it whatsoever. It is open to all\nresidents who are otherwise not covered by --\nQUESTION: Maine says those are never caught --\nQUESTION:\nthe things that Maine said was, you've stopped us at the\nthreshold. We could have regulations that say, for\nexample, people who are covered by insurance will not have\naccess to this benefit, but on the question -- you said\nwould -- you would be content if the Court said, the\nSecretary has to look at it, until then it's no good.\nWould you have -- this is the -- your lawsuit.\nCould you have gone to the Secretary and say, said,\nSecretary, we want you to look at this, the Secretary\nsays, I'm busy with a dozen other things and I don't want\nto look at it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know of any statutory\nmechanism for a third party to come in and ask the\nSecretary to review a State plan. I don't know that -- I\ndon't know that there's anything that prevents anyone from\nsending a letter to the Secretary to ask him to take, to\nundertake that. That said, the Secretary obviously knows\nabout this particular scheme.\nQUESTION: Yes, and the Secretary, you said that\nthe -- at least the SG supports your view that this --\nthat this program of Maine's is impermissible, but the SG\nalso told us, essentially, that this case wasn't ripe, so\nwe shouldn't have granted cert. I mean, that was the SG's\nfirst position, that this is a -- we don't know what, in\nfact, the Maine scheme is, because it was never -- it\nnever went into effect, because you got an injunction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the one thing that we\nabsolutely know about the Maine scheme, and it -- Justice\nBreyer described it, is that every Medicaid recipient is\nplaced at risk by the prior authorization scheme.\nQUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Phillips, are there any\nfindings that any Medicaid recipient has actually been\nharmed by this program? I -- this is a --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because there was a\njoinder --\nQUESTION: -- one of the things that bothers me,\nI don't know that we have any findings by the district\ncourt as to what the real impact will be. I know your --\nyour -- the Government says this is going to happen --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if --\nQUESTION: -- but if everybody agreed, for\nexample, to join the Maine program, maybe it may work out\nfine.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- I don't have to go to the\nUnited States. The State of Maine concedes in its brief\nat page 25, Maine Rx can be expected to trigger prior\nauthorization more often than previously.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it may well be that prior\nauthorization would, in turn, lead to some solution\nbetween the drug companies and the State as to how this\nwill all be handled. I don't think the fact they agreed\nthat it would trigger prior authorization necessarily\nproves the conclusion that the Medicaid recipients will be\nharmed. It may well be true, but I'm just not sure --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, but --\nQUESTION: -- the record supports that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- as of this stage of the case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, but there'd be no way to\nenjoin the program before going into effect, which means\nthat you essentially have to wait until actual Medicaid\nrecipients are deprived of drugs in order to be able to\nimplement -- to stop a program that on its face does\nnothing to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries, and clearly\nposes a serious threat to them.\nI -- if we go back to Hines v. Davidowitz\nlanguage, it talks about the full achievement of Congress'\nobjectives.\nQUESTION: But it only opposes the very threat\nthat the statute by its own terms authorizes. That's the\nthreat.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, but it only authorizes --\nQUESTION: The threat of prior approval which\nthe statute authorizes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nrelated purposes.\nQUESTION: But the statute doesn't say that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I understand that, Justice\nStevens, but the point is that if you read the statute,\nand it's essentially six, those six words, to say that the\nState has unlimited authority to do that, it strikes me as\ninconceivable that Congress would have allowed this entire\nmechanism to be available for the State to come in and\nsimply to raise revenue from out-of-State manufacturers.\nThere is no rational basis for that kind of a conclusion.\nThe much more sensible way to narrow the statute\nis to say, if it serves other Medicaid purposes, then\nthat's an appropriate way to proceed. If it doesn't, then\nit seems to me the -- the Court has to conclude that the\nbest interests of the beneficiaries ultimately has to\ntrump here under these circumstances.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, do you also rely on the\nCommerce Clause as somehow prohibiting what Maine has\ndone --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I --\nQUESTION: -- and if so, how do you make that\nargument?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice O'Connor, we have\nthree components to that argument. The thing that is -- I\nconcede at the outset that there is no case at this Court\nthat directly controls in either direction. This is a\nunique scheme that's been adopted here, and -- and --\nQUESTION: Is there anything in the Commerce\nClause that prevents a State from addressing within its\nState boundaries requirements for dispensing prescription\ndrugs?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, when the entire burden of\nthe program falls out of State, it seems to us that this\ncreates at least a serious question about what's going on\nhere. The --\nQUESTION: Well, any State regulation, a State\nwants to have a special rule for a bicycle, you could say,\nwell, that increases the cost to the manufacturer and the\nother States have to pay for it, so I'm -- I'm not sure\nthat that reasoning, which was in your brief, carries the\nday.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I --\nQUESTION: Like a special fuel requirement for\nautomobiles? Do you think California can set certain\nstandards, that of course it affects the auto\nmanufacturers? They don't make them in California.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. There's no question that\nStates are free to create certain types of regulations\nthat are different from other States, and that's -- and\nthat's not the full sweep of the argument that we're\nmaking here. What -- what --\nQUESTION: That's not what happened here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, that's --\nQUESTION: I don't understand the Commerce\nClause argument.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I wouldn't presume to try to\nteach you about the Commerce Clause, Justice O'Connor, but\nthe reality of what's happening here is much more like the\nWest Lynn Creamery case, where what you're talking about\nis the payment of a subsidy, all by out-of-state entities,\nin order to benefit -- in that case it was to benefit in-\nstate competitors. There are no in-state competitors in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Oh, I've got quite --\nQUESTION: Isn't that a --\nQUESTION: -- a problem with the argument.\nQUESTION: That was the problem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I didn't hear --\nQUESTION: Well -- no, let me yield to Justice\nKennedy.\nQUESTION: I had thought you might make the\nargument -- I didn't see it in your brief, maybe I missed\nit -- that this is just so burdensome on manufacturers to\ngo from State to State to State that it's just an -- it's\nan undue burden on an interstate transaction, period.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Under Pike v. Bruce Church.\nQUESTION: And -- and Southern Pacific v.\nArizona.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yeah. The reason we didn't raise\nthat argument is that we thought that we would require --\nin order to make that argument we would require more\nfactual findings by the district court --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- in order to get into it,\nbecause there's a balancing component to that --\nQUESTION: The other thing I wondered about is,\nif you've come over from Vermont or New York you can't\nhave the advantage of this. I suppose it's not\nnecessarily in your interest to argue that it has to be\nexpanded to other States, but I -- it seems to me that\nalso was a questionable part of the program.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I do think one of the real\nproblems with this program is that some States will adopt\nthis kind of a scheme and other States won't adopt this\nkind of a scheme, which means that you're going to have\ninherent discrimination with respect to consumers. Some\nconsumers will benefit to the detriment of other\nconsumers, and it does seem to me that -- that the theory\nof West Lynn Creamery was designed to say that you don't\njust look at the competitors and the relationships between\nthem, you have to look more broadly at the manufacturers,\nthe wholesalers, all the retailers, and all the way down\nto the consumers, and if you have the kind of\ndiscriminatory effects here where Maine seizes for itself\nall the economic benefits and imposes on -- on everyone\nelse the economic burdens, that in that circumstance this\nruns afoul of the core --\nQUESTION: The -- wasn't this --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- command of the Commerce\nClause.\nQUESTION: -- one of the reasons the First\nCircuit vacated the injunction, the fact that there just\nhadn't been any factual development here as to what was\nhappening?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that was part -- yes, to be\nsure, Mr. Chief Justice, that's part of what they said.\nOn the other hand, if you accept our basic theory about\nthe clear discriminatory implication of the way the scheme\noperates, that kind of an operation is per se invalid.\nThat's what the Court held in -- in West Lynn Creamery.\nQUESTION: But isn't the West Lynn Creamery\ndifficulty in your argument that here, unlike West Lynn,\nthere are no entities within the same category,\nmanufacturers, e.g., producers, for example, some of whom\nare being discriminated in favor of others? What's going\non here is not discrimination by the State within a given\nclass to benefit the members of the class within the\nState. What is going on here is a scheme which happens to\nfall on certain individuals in a manufacturing class who,\nincidentally, are out of State, for the benefit of people\nin a different class, that is, the consumers, who are in-\nState, and West Lynn doesn't govern that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, it doesn't directly cover\nthat, and I conceded that at the outset.\nOn the other hand, the point here is that there\nare entities out there in the stream that are within\nMaine, and on whom this burden is not imposed. It was\nchosen to impose the burden strictly on the manufacturers,\nand it is done in a way that will create disparate impacts\nwith respect to consumers in Maine versus consumers in\nother -- in other States, but --\nQUESTION: That is -- I mean, that's a -- that's\na necessary consequence of the prior approval scheme.\nThat -- you're going to have that argument no -- no matter\nhow -- no matter how prior approval --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, and -- and if it operates\nwithin Medicaid, it seems to me that there's no -- there's\nno significant argument to be made there, because Congress\nhas basically taken it over.\nQUESTION: Simply because you've got to have it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But otherwise -- and one last\npoint I'd like to make, which is simply that the Commerce\nClause issue does not need to be addressed in the event\nthe Court holds that the, that the Maine statute is\npreempted.\nIf -- I'd like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Department of Health & Human Services has\narticulated a position on two issues that are directly\nrelevant to this case, and those positions are set forth\nin the letter to the State Medicaid directors that is set\nforth in an appendix to our brief at page, I believe it's\npage 45a it begins. The first of those --\nQUESTION: Well, does that lead to a conclusion\nas to its view as to this program that we're considering?\nIs it valid, or isn't it?\nMR. KNEEDLER:\nproblems --\nQUESTION: As far as the Secretary is concerned.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There are two problems with\nthe -- with the State program under this Medicaid\ndirector's letter that the Secretary sent out. The first\nis that it's the position of the department that a plan\nsuch as this, which imposes a prior approval requirement\nfor Medicaid patients, if the drug manufacturer does not\npay rebates with respect to sales to non-Medicaid\npatients, that sort of change is a material change in the\nState's plan which requires the approval of a plan\namendment.\nThere is a regulation that we cite in our brief\nat page 28, and quote, that requires that, and that, by\nthe way, I think could be the -- the mechanism effectively\nfor a prior jurisdiction sort of approach.\nQUESTION: I see that, but I -- I mean, I'm a\nlittle bit at sea. I absolutely wouldn't call it primary\njurisdiction. The label doesn't matter, but the -- the --\nbut -- now, where I'm -- where I'm -- where I'm at sea is\nin figuring out whether it's possible to say, and you\ndon't say this in your brief, that -- that a program like\nMaine's, which is arguably, arguably wrong, or arguably\nright, that it can't go into effect without the prior\napproval of HHS.\nup the approval statutes, a whole lot of things that\nweren't briefed.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's -- the -- the -- we\nhave cited this regulation in our brief, and the -- and\nunder Allens v. Robbins the Secretary's, or the -- the\nSecretary's interpretation's set forth in the brief. It's\nalso set forth in the Medicaid director's letter.\nQUESTION: After the Secretary acted under it,\nthen. What are you bothering us for? If the Secretary\nhas power under this -- under this regulation to stop this\nplan from going forward because it amounts to an amendment\nof the -- of the plan, and an amendment that hasn't been\napproved, the -- the Secretary has the power to stop it.\nWhy -- you know, why --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- do we have to get involved?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could just answer that\nand then move to the second question, because I think it's\nrelated, the regulation identifies what -- that material\nchanges in the plan have to be submitted for an amendment.\nThe Secretary's enforcement authority comes from a\ndifferent source, which is in 42 U.S.C. 1396c, which\nallows the Secretary to cut off funds in whole or in part\nif a State is operating under a plan that requires an\namendment because of those changes, so -- but I --\nQUESTION: Well then, why doesn't the Secretary\ndo it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it was -- it's entirely\nreasonable -- first of all, that's a matter of enforcement\ndiscretion under Heckler v. Cheney, and at least for the\ntime being, why this -- while this case is under -- is\nunder submission, the Secretary has not -- has not\nproceeded.\nQUESTION: Well, but I think the Secretary is\nignoring one serious problem, and I suspect it's behind\nJustice Scalia's question. It's certainly in my mind.\nIt's one thing for the Secretary to act within enforcement\npower. It's one thing for the Secretary to interpret the\nregs by, the statute by regulations that are subject to\nChevron deference, but if the Secretary does neither one\nof those things, and from one side of the Secretary's\nmouth we hear, well, yes, some prior approval beyond what\nis strictly necessary for the direct benefit of Medicaid\nrecipients is okay, but this goes a little bit too far,\ncourts are then placed in the position of saying, well,\ncan we read the statute so precisely as to say that the\nSecretary's position of what is okay is okay and, by going\nthis step further, there's a violation of the statute?\nWe are placed in a very difficult position, in\neffect by the Secretary, by you, in being asked to draw a\nline with a very fine pencil, whereas if the Secretary\nwants to act under administrative authority, presumably\nthat's the end of it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, in going forward, I mean,\nthe Secretary issued this Medicaid director's letter in\nSeptember, after the Court had granted review --\nQUESTION: Ah.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- because this was an area that\nrequired attention. Going forward, we -- we expect\nthat -- that States will submit their proposals to the\nSecretary as plan amendments --\nQUESTION: Well, is there some --\nQUESTION: And --\nQUESTION: Is there some mechanism by -- or\nauthority by which we could somehow refer this back to the\ndistrict court to seek some kind of information from the\nSecretary?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, here's the way I think that\nit could proceed.\nQUESTION: How -- how could we do it? I don't\nknow of a doctrine but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think the procedural\nposture of this case would allow that, and let me explain\nwhy. The Secretary's second position in this case, which\nI wanted to also make sure I articulated, which was that\na -- that a proposed, or a plan such as this, which\nprovides for rebates for non-Medicaid patients, still must\nserve some Medicaid purpose.\nIn the district court, when the district court\nentered what is only a preliminary injunction at this\nstage, at page 71 of the petition appendix, the district\ncourt pointed out that the State had not argued that its\nproposal served any Medicaid purpose. As the preliminary\ninjunction was entered, it was entered on that premise.\nThe court of appeals then speculated that perhaps it does\nserve a Medicaid purpose, but looking back at when the\npreliminary injunction was entered, it was entered on the\npremise that it served none, and we think, and the\nSecretary believes that a plan must at least serve some\nMedicaid purpose.\nQUESTION: But as I understand it, Mr. Kneedler,\nit is -- it is at least theoretically possible that the\nSecretary could approve this very plan.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- on the proper showing. The\nrationale --\nQUESTION: Right, of course. It needs more\nfacts.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. The rationale adopted by\nthe district court was the rationale that some --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMedicaid-related purpose that may or may not be\nsufficient.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- but we believe that the\npurpose that has been advanced does not save this statute.\nThe purpose that has been advanced and was identified by\nthe court of appeals was a purpose that some people who\nwere close to being Medicaid-eligible will be forced to\nspend more on drugs, may become Medicaid-eligible, and\ntherefore cost the Medicaid program more money. That's a\nMedicaid-related purpose. The problem is, the State\nstatute is not tailored to people who are close to the\npoverty line.\nQUESTION: So is the procedure --\nQUESTION: Would you -- would you finish your\nresponse to me --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. What --\nQUESTION: -- to tell me --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- what it is that you think we could\ndo?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If the Court reversed the court\nof appeals decision, in effect affirmed the district\ncourt's injunction, which was entered on the basis that\nthe plan serves no Medicaid-related purpose, the State\nprogram would be enjoined.\nAt that point the State of Maine could submit\nthe program to the Secretary of Health & Human Services\nalong with any justifications for the plan, such as\nthose -- there are two additional ones that have been\nraised in its brief in this Court for the first time, and\nwe think that's how it should play out.\nThis is a -- right now, the case presents a very\nnarrow issue on a preliminary injunction.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't that procedure be\nfollowed by affirming, and saying there should be a\nhearing in the district court on these very issues that\nyou're raising, and both sides would present the facts?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We don't think it would be a\nhearing in the district court. We believe it should be\nsubmitted to the Secretary, because a plan amendment is\nrequired, but we do believe that -- that the petitioner\nhas made a sufficient showing based on the, on what the\ndistrict court said, that this plan, that Maine had\noffered no justification, no Medicaid justification for\nthe plan.\nQUESTION: Do you read the statutory\nauthorization for prior approval to mean prior approval\nonly if there's a Medicaid-related benefit?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we do. The legislative\nhistory of the prior approval position --\nQUESTION: You rely entirely on legislative\nhistory for that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, and also there are two other\nprovisions of the act which we think are relevant, on the\none hand, a(19), which talks about the best interests of\nthe patients, but on the other hand, a(30) -- this is\n1396a(30)(A), which says that a State plan must provide\nfor methods of payment that advance efficiency and economy\nin the Medicaid program.\nWe think both of those speak to interests within\nthe Medicaid program and require in the prior approval\nprocess, as well as in the administration of the plan\ngenerally, weighing the interests of the Medicaid\nbeneficiaries against the broader institutional interests\nof the Medicaid program. If there was no Medicaid-related\npurpose requirement at all, then a State could impose a\nprior approval requirement if the drug company contributes\nmoney to the art museum or to the State highway program.\nWe think that under this Court's decision in Dublino, the\nState must be pursuing a purpose in common with the\nFederal Government, a Medicaid-related purpose. What --\nwhat the scope --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, it -- it was the\nGovernment's first position that this Court ought to let\nthe case ripen, and now you -- you are necessarily taking\na position in this lawsuit because we granted cert, but\nthe Government made a pretty good argument essentially\nthat this case wasn't ripe.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, ripe for this Court's\nreview, but we now -- we now believe that, given that the\ndirector's letter that was sent out in September, that\nthere is a basis, there's an articulation of the\nSecretary's position both on plan amendments and the\nrequirement of a Medicaid-related purpose that -- that\nthis Court could properly dispose of the case in the\nnarrow -- in the narrow way I suggested which, of course,\nwould also obviate any requirement to consider the\nCommerce Clause question.\nThings have evolved in the Secretary's\nevaluation of this and, as Justice O'Connor, I think\npointed out, the Secretary has since approved a Michigan\nplan amendment under this same general approach.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Hagler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. HAGLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HAGLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court:\nPeople without insurance are charged more for\nprescription drugs than any other purchaser in the market,\noften much more. Patients who are forced to pay cash at\nthe pharmacy are those least able to absorb these high\nprices. To ameliorate this hardship, Maine's legislature\nwill embrace a market-based approach used by other large\nthird party purchasers to leverage its purchasing power\nunder -- as a third party purchaser in Medicaid to obtain\nprice relief for the uninsured in Maine.\nQUESTION: And you think that's one of the valid\nuses of the authorization provision? You think that's why\nit was included in the statute, so that a State could --\ncould shake down drug companies to lower prices to other\npeople?\nMR. HAGLER: I concede that -- that Congress\nnever thought that Maine might use prior authorization in\nthe way that Maine Rx anticipates it. However, what\nCongress said --\nQUESTION: You can use it for anything at all?\nCould -- could you use it to -- to say, we -- you know,\nyou -- you have to pay each member of the Maine\nlegislature $100 a year? Could -- could you put that in\nthere?\nMR. HAGLER: As you get further and further for\nthe purposes of -- of providing health care, you approach\nuses a -- of prior authorization that might offend\nCongress and this Court, but preemption is a question for\nCongress.\nQUESTION: Well, did Maine offer in the district\ncourt, in the hearings on whether a preliminary injunction\nshould issue, a justification for how the Maine Rx program\nbenefits Medicaid patients?\nMR. HAGLER: We did not so argue in the district\ncourt.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: When you say -- who does it apply to?\nThat is, the statute says it applies to qualified\nresidents. They define that as people with a Maine Rx\nenrollment card, and now I don't know who those people\nare. Is it virtually everybody in the State? Is it a\nsmall subclass, those who don't have insurance? Who is\nit?\nMR. HAGLER: Well, it's -- it's those without\ninsurance.\nQUESTION: So that's a fairly small group. What\npercentage of that -- it's 15 percent of the people of\nMaine?\nMR. HAGLER: If -- we estimate 22 percent. The\nAARP had a different --\nQUESTION: Okay, so 15, 22 percent. Now, if\nthat being so, it sounds to me like it could be like the\none that was approved, or maybe it's not like the one that\nwas approved.\nMR. HAGLER: And you don't know --\nQUESTION: It sounds like a case, to me, that\nhas to go to the Secretary, whose job it is to approve it,\nrather than having us fly blind.\nMR. HAGLER: Well, here's the difference between\nwhat the Secretary approved and what the Maine -- and --\nand what he's proposing with respect to Maine Rx and the\nplan amendments. What the Secretary approved was a\nprogram that's a demonstration project, a waiver program,\nallowing more people into Medicaid notwithstanding the\nfact that they're ineligible.\nQUESTION: That has been approved for Maine?\nMR. HAGLER: Approved and struck down by the\nD.C. Circuit on Christmas Eve. The Secretary and the\nSolicitor General, the Secretary and the Solicitor General\nidentified the fact that that program helped people up to\n300 percent of poverty. Without the Healthy Maine\nprogram, the demonstration project, Maine Rx is now the\nonly program that helps those people.\nQUESTION: That isn't an answer to my question.\nThe answer to my -- my question was, it sounds to me like\na program that the Secretary might approve or might not\napprove, and so why should we fly blind? Why isn't it the\ncase that you can't put this program into effect, given\nFederal law, without the approval of the Secretary?\nNow, when she approves it or disapproves it,\nthey can argue about whether that was legal.\nMR. HAGLER: Well, the Secretary is suggesting\nthat the State of Maine seek a plan amendment, but by\ndefinition, a plan amendment allows -- a plan amendment is\nsomething that, if we sought a plan amendment to run Maine\nRx it would necessarily be allowed by the Medicaid\nstatute. 42 -- the Medicaid statute, 1396 section --\nQUESTION: I'm not following you. Is your\nargument that --\nMR. HAGLER: We don't --\nQUESTION: -- even if the Secretary disapproved\nthis, were it a plan, we still could do it? If that's\nyour argument, I'll answer that question. That's a legal\nquestion. I think it's an easy one to answer. In my\nmind, the answer's no.\nMR. HAGLER: Well, if the Secretary were to --\nQUESTION: Now, you can explain why it shouldn't\nbe no, but I want to know if that's what I'm supposed to\ndecide.\nMR. HAGLER: It's not what you're supposed to\ndecide. The Secretary has not acted, other than speaking\nto this Court through the brief of the Solicitor General.\nThe Medicaid statute provides a mechanism for the\nSecretary to tell the State when it is running its\nMedicaid program in a fashion which violates the\nprovisions of the Medicaid statute. That is --\nQUESTION: Well, but is this actually a -- the -\n- the State -- the State of Maine running its Medicaid\nprogram, it --it's a freestanding statute, isn't it?\nMR. HAGLER: It's an entirely different --\ncorrect, it's an entirely different statute. We don't\nbelieve we need a plan amendment to seek approval to run\nthe Maine Rx program.\nQUESTION: That's fine. So then you want me to\ndecide the question of whether it would be possible to\nhave this statute even if the Secretary, were it an\namendment to the Medicaid plan, would say no, okay? I say\nthat's a legal question we can decide.\nMR. HAGLER: But you should not decide that now.\nQUESTION: Is that what you think we should\ndecide now? Are you following what I'm saying or not? Am\nI not --\nMR. HAGLER: Not precisely.\nQUESTION: I can decide the question if the\nSec -- you're saying -- suppose the Secretary's approval\nmakes no difference. Let us assume the Secretary would\ndisapprove it.\nMR. HAGLER: Okay.\nQUESTION: There would -- a legal question, can\nyou have this statute anyway?\nMR. HAGLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. That's what you think we\nshould decide?\nMR. HAGLER: I believe that's what I --\nQUESTION: All right. If that's what you think\nwe should decide, fine, then why isn't the answer to that\nquestion clearly no? You would have a Federal statute, it\nuses the Federal program, the Secretary thinks it's\ncontrary to the Federal program, the Secretary's views are\nwithin her authority, let's say, under the -- under the\nFederal program, and so a State cannot put something into\neffect --\nMR. HAGLER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that is so clearly contrary to the\nMedicaid program using the Medicaid device.\nMR. HAGLER: The question that this -- the first\nquestion that this Court certified was, as described in\nthe Secretary's brief, is whether the Federal Medicaid\nstatute allows the use of that authority under the statute\nto compel -- the prior authorization authority --\nQUESTION: And I assume it --\nMR. HAGLER: And he says yes.\nQUESTION:\nmoney for us to send it back to the Secretary, at least if\nwe are convinced on the basis of the briefs submitted\nhere, that even if the Secretary did approve it, that\napproval would be invalid. I mean, you would concede\nthat --\nMR. HAGLER: If the --\nQUESTION: -- that whatever primary jurisdiction\nis involved here --\nMR. HAGLER: If the --\nQUESTION: -- it certainly makes no sense to\nsend it back to the Secretary if, when the Secretary\napproves it, there is then a lawsuit and we say, oh, by\nthe way, he couldn't approve this.\nMR. HAGLER: Right.\nQUESTION: This goes too far. We might as well\ndecide that now, no?\nMR. HAGLER: You can decide the preemption\nquestion now, and I think that the Court should, and the\npreemption question is whether Congress intended to\nprohibit what Maine has here done.\nWhen Congress legislates against the backdrop of\nthe preemption doctrine and it give -- gave to the State\nthe discretion to subject to prior authorization any\ncovered outpatient drug, it qualified that discretion\nhardly at all.\nprovisions, the procedural safeguards that require that if\nprior authorization is sought --\nQUESTION: Doesn't the Secretary have some\ndiscretion in this area as to whether to say it's good or\nbad, the -- the Maine plan, or are you saying it's simply\nnot his business?\nMR. HAGLER: It's Congress' business --\nQUESTION: Well, right.\nMR. HAGLER: -- to set the line --\nQUESTION: But did Congress in what it enacted\nleave any room for the Secretary to have some discretion\nhere?\nMR. HAGLER: What Congress enacted was the\nopportunity for the Secretary to tell the State that when\nit's begun a program or is operating its Medicaid program\nout of compliance with the Medicaid statute, that it\nbelieves that that's the case, and the provision provides\nfor a fair hearing for the State, we get together with the\nSecretary, we try to work it out. If we can't, and if the\nSecretary -- if Maine persists in wanting to run the\nprogram, and the Secretary disapproves the program, then\nhis remedy is to withhold money from the State and --\nQUESTION: But if-- if it's a freestanding\npro -- if it's a freestanding statute, not part of Maine's\nMedicaid, how can the Secretary disapprove a freestanding\nstatute?\nMR. HAGLER: What he can do is look to the\neffect of what happens once Maine Rx is implemented, and\nlook to the effect on the Medicaid beneficiaries as to\nwhether or not they'll be harmed.\nQUESTION: Well, the Secretary theoretically\ncould conclude already that to require prior approval for\nevery prescription drug will have negative effects on\nMedicaid recipients who otherwise would not have to seek\nprior approval, because there's quite a bit in the record\nabout the difficulty when prior approval must be obtained.\nMR. HAGLER: Oh, I submit there -- that\nthere's -- I disagree with respect to the record. I\nbelieve that there's very little in the record which\ndemonstrates that there will be any harm to Maine Rx\nbeneficiaries, harm to their health, once Maine Rx is\nimposed, and should the State ultimately impose prior\nauthorizations under the Maine Rx statute.\nYou have lodging materials which are untested.\nThe fact of the matter is, if we were to return to the\ndistrict court we could demonstrate, based on a vigorous\nuse of prior authorization in the 2 years that have\nintervened the granting of the injunction and today, that\nwe are imposing prior authorization and we are answering\nthe phone in less than 2 hours, and that Medicaid patients\nare, in fact, not being harmed.\nWe -- our position is that to survive a facial\nchallenge the petitioner must demonstrate that any use of\nprior authorization, as contemplated by the Maine Rx --\nQUESTION: Well, I question whether this is\ncorrectly described as a facial challenge. You think of a\nfacial challenge more in terms of somebody who has a --\nFirst Amendment implications, or at least criminal law\napplications. This -- as I read the First Circuit's\nopinion, although they talked about a facial challenge, I\nthought what they were saying was, we just don't know\nenough, since the thing had never gone into effect to\nuphold the injunction.\nMR. HAGLER: No, and -- and what the First\nCircuit didn't know was how the program would actually be\nimplemented, and there are many ways of implementing the\nprogram that not only will not cause harm to Medicaid\nbeneficiaries, but which will affirmatively advance the\npurposes of Medicaid.\nQUESTION: Is the program now in a -- being\noperated?\nMR. HAGLER: It is not, and the reason that it's\nnot is because the --\nQUESTION: The way you spoke, I thought you had\nsome current experience.\nMR. HAGLER: We do have current experience with\nthe use of prior authorization to save Medicaid money.\nQUESTION: For Medicaid, for Medicaid patients.\nMR. HAGLER: For Medicaid, correct, and as a\nresult of that experience we know much more about our\nabilities and would be able to describe to the district\ncourt much more about our abilities should the First\nCircuit --\nQUESTION: Why wasn't the plan put into effect\nif the injunction was lifted?\nMR. HAGLER: The mandate was stayed pending --\nQUESTION: Oh, I see.\nMR. HAGLER: -- for a writ of certiorari, so\nwe've -- we've not had an opportunity to implement the\nprogram.\nQUESTION: But the Federal Government, with\nreference to Medicaid, certainly thinks prior\nauthorization is an important enforcement mechanism and\nnow you're saying oh, don't worry about it, it doesn't\nmake much difference.\nMR. HAGLER: Well --\nQUESTION: That's hard for me to accept.\nMR. HAGLER: Well, the Federal Government agrees\nthat prior authorization -- prior authorization is\nundeniably a cost-saving measure.\npurpose why Congress permitted the States broad discretion\nto impose prior authorization.\nUnder the Maine Rx program, what the State is\nsaying to manufacturers is, please negotiate with us, and\nif you don't negotiate with us, we will review the drugs\nthat you manufacture to see and determine, on a drug-by-\ndrug basis, whether it would be appropriate to subject\nthose drugs to prior authorization.\nQUESTION: But the very reason you put that on\nthe bargaining table is because you know it's going to --\nit's going to slow down the sales of some of these drugs.\nIncidentally, I -- and you can answer that. I take it\nthat if Company X has 10 different drugs, and it can't\nagree with you on the rebate price for just one, that all\nof those drugs must have prior authorization, or am I\nwrong about that?\nMR. HAGLER: I believe that you're wrong. I\nbelieve that -- that the Secretary has the discretion --\nQUESTION: I read the Government's brief to the\ncontrary, but I'll take a look at it.\nMR. HAGLER: Yeah, I believe --\nQUESTION: You're representing that it's drug-\nby-drug, so a company can agree with you as to nine of the\ndrugs, and those will not be subject to prior\nauthorization, but only the tenth drug, as to which you\ncan't agree, will be subject to prior authorization?\nMR. HAGLER: I believe --\nQUESTION: That's your representation?\nMR. HAGLER: As to the -- I believe that our\nadministrative rules demonstrate, proposed administrative\nrules that the Department hasn't enacted because the\ninjunction has been imposed allow the Department of Human\nServices of the State of Maine to look on a drug-by-drug\nbasis as to whether any particular drug ought to be\nsubjected to prior --\nQUESTION: Does it allow it, if it uses, to look\non a company-by-company basis, as I'd first described? In\nother words, does it subject --\nMR. HAGLER: What will happen is, if --\nQUESTION: -- to discretion of the State.\nMR. HAGLER: In other words, if Pfizer were to\nagree to provide a rebate for some of its drugs but not\nall of its drugs, must we look to the other drugs --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HAGLER: -- and determine prior\nauthorization? The statute contemplates a negotiation.\nThe Commissioner is to use his best efforts to negotiate\nwith manufacturers in order to --\nQUESTION: I take that to be a yes?\nMR. HAGLER:\nQUESTION: You can keep all of their drugs off\nunless they give you what you want for some of them?\nMR. HAGLER: We could, but the statute also\nallows us not to.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. HAGLER: The purpose of that --\nQUESTION: You could, that's -- and -- and you\nsay it -- that the statute envisions using this\nauthorization as a cost-saving measure. Does this save\nany costs -- does this statute save any cost to the\nMedicare recipients?\nMR. HAGLER: To the Medicare?\nQUESTION: To -- to the Medicaid --\nMR. HAGLER: Oh, the Medicaid recipients, the\nMedicaid recipients themselves pay nothing, but it can\nsave money in, and it's probable that it will save money\nin the Medicaid program, and the reason for that --\nQUESTION: I understand, because some people\nwon't come into the program who otherwise would come in.\nMR. HAGLER: Well, that's what the First Circuit\npicked up on, but the other reason and the other method in\nwhich it would save Medicaid money is, it would result in\nshifting prescribing behavior from more expensive drugs to\nless expensive drugs. The Commissioner, under\nsubsection --\nQUESTION: But doesn't that depend on who you\nmake the deals with? Maybe the more expensive drug --\ndrugs we're willing to make this deal with you, and the\nless expensive not willing.\nMR. HAGLER: Subsection 13 of the Maine Rx\nstatute gives to the Commissioner the discretion to run\nthe Medicaid program and the Maine Rx program in a\ncoordinated manner so as to enhance efficiencies in both,\nand so I believe that the Commissioner would never impose\nprior authorization on the cheapest drug in a therapeutic\nclass even if that manufacturer didn't provide a Maine Rx\nrebate, because it would be silly to do so. He's got a\nbudget to operate.\nQUESTION: I've known some silly administrators.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The point is, he could do it. The\npoint is, he could -- you're - you're -- you're -- you're\ntroubled by a -- by a statute which would allow a denial\nof authorization unless the drug company pays $100 to each\nmember of the -- of the legislature. I -- I gather you -\n- you acknowledge that -- that the authorization\nrequirement in the statute has some unstated limitation\nupon it, or don't you acknowledge that?\nMR. HAGLER: I believe that -- that under the\nCourt's preemption analysis we look to the primary\npurposes of the Medicaid statute and you seek to determine\nwhat Congress intended.\nQUESTION: Does the authorization provision have\nsome unstated limitation upon it, a limitation that is not\nin that sole provision alone?\nMR. HAGLER: I believe that it doesn't, but even\nif it does --\nQUESTION: It doesn't, so $100 to each\nlegislator is okay?\nMR. HAGLER: And -- and -- and when that offends\nCongress, Congress has the ability to act.\nQUESTION: The real question is whether it has\nan unstated limitation that's sufficiently clear that it\npreempts the State law.\nMR. HAGLER: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The real question is whether the\nunstated limitation is sufficiently clear to be preemptive\nof a State statute to the contrary.\nMR. HAGLER: That's -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, how is Congress --\nMR. HAGLER: The language of the statute is, a\nState may subject to prior authorization any covered\noutpatient drug.\nQUESTION: Well, how could Congress --\nMR. HAGLER: Every --\nQUESTION: Sorry. No, go ahead. Finish,\nplease.\nMR. HAGLER: Indeed, every outpatient drug could\nbe subjected to prior authorization. That, too, would be\nsilly, but the power is that broad.\nQUESTION: Now, that's what I want to know.\nWhy? I mean, how could Congress possibly want a statute\nwhich would hurt the Medicaid patients at -- no argument\nit wouldn't hurt some of them, and has nothing to be said\nfor helping anyone related to Medicaid?\nMR. HAGLER: Well, we -- we disagree that --\nQUESTION: I know you disagree about whether\nthat's the effect.\nMR. HAGLER: -- that it will not hurt people.\nQUESTION: I understand that.\nMR. HAGLER: Right.\nQUESTION: So how can I decide this case without\nknowing whether the people in charge of the statute agree\nwith you about that, as they might, or you might negotiate\nsome implementation of how to have regulations that they\ncan agree to, or, or, or, the possibilities are endless.\nHow can I decide in your favor, in other words, without\nknowing, the same question, what the Secretary thinks?\nMR. HAGLER: Because the Secretary can act if\nthe injunction -- if the First Circuit's decision is\naffirmed, the Secretary can act, and tell the State of\nMaine we believe that you will harm Medicaid beneficiaries\nand we will take your money away.\nQUESTION: But suppose --\nMR. HAGLER: But the Secretary hasn't acted.\nThe Secretary has asked this Court to approve his notions\nof what Maine Rx might look like if it were more limited\nin scope in terms of the number of beneficiaries, but he\nhasn't defined for the Court how to set the line.\nQUESTION: Suppose the State passes a law that\nsays that each Medicaid beneficiary shall pay an\nadditional tax of $50 a year. You say that the only way\nto get rid of that law, which would certainly contravene\nthe -- the whole purpose of Medicaid. The only way to get\nrid of it is to go to the Secretary and say, since this\nlaw is an amendment of the State's plan, you should\napprove it, it requires your approval.\nMR. HAGLER: Now, there --\nQUESTION: They couldn't strike that down as\njust being contrary to the --\nMR. HAGLER: No, it's contrary to the statute.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HAGLER: Medicaid beneficiaries can't be\nrequired to pay more than a nominal co-pay.\nQUESTION: Okay, so --\nMR. HAGLER: Congress thought --\nQUESTION: So the only remedy for something that\nis contrary to the statute is not going through the\nSecretary, that some things that are contrary to the\nstatute can be attacked directly, as is being done here.\nMR. HAGLER: But -- but I'm not convinced that\nfrom the text of the statute you can find an intent --\nQUESTION: Okay. That's a different question.\nMR. HAGLER: -- on the part of Congress to\nprohibit this, and even if it were to -- Congress were to\nprohibit using Maine Rx like prior authorizations for some\npurpose wholly unrelated to health care, when you get\ncloser and closer to something approaching what the\nSecretary in fact does approve of, how can a court set the\nline? The question really is --\nQUESTION: That's the merits question, rather\nthan whether we have, you know, power to -- to move at\nall, so long as the Secretary can handle the problem by\ndenying approval.\nMR. HAGLER: The Secretary has indicated that\nhe'll handle the problem, or he's expressed his views\nabout what the program is. The Court should wait to see\nwhether the -- I mean, the Court should allow the\nSecretary to --\nQUESTION: Can I ask you this question: I\nthought you would agree that, if it were clear as a matter\nof fact that this program was going to harm Medicaid\nrecipients, that we would have power to enjoin the\nprogram?\nMR. HAGLER: Yes, but it's not -- I do agree\nwith that.\nQUESTION: So your argument, as I understand it,\nit's an unresolved factual question whether, in fact,\nthese adverse consequences would follow?\nMR. HAGLER: That's correct. We have -- there's\nno facts in the record, and -- and this -- this is a\nfacial challenge in which my colleague has to demonstrate\nthat they are in no way -- there's no possibility of\nimplementing the program in a way which doesn't cause harm\nto --\nQUESTION: Well, I may not agree with that\nstatement, but at least they have to make a showing there\nin fact will be an adverse effect.\nMR. HAGLER: Some showing.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HAGLER: And the only showing that the\ndistrict court seized upon is this notion that, by\ndefinition, prior authorization imposes some sort of\nprocedural impediment to free access to all drugs on\nbehalf of Medicaid patients, but the --\nQUESTION: I thought you -- I thought you had\nacknowledged that the authorization requirement must not\nmerely not harm Medicaid recipients, but that the\nauthorization must serve the purpose of helping Medicaid\nrecipients. Don't -- don't -- don't you acknowledge that?\nMR. HAGLER: Our --\nQUESTION: You were saying it does help them,\nyou know, and you're mentioning the ways in which it helps\nthe Medicaid program.\nMR. HAGLER: Under either test we think we win.\nUnder the first test, the question should be, did Congress\nintend to prohibit what Maine has here done? If the\nquestion is, does the Maine Rx program advance the\npurposes of Medicaid --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. HAGLER: -- it assuredly does that.\nQUESTION: But you don't think that's necessary?\nMR. HAGLER: I'm -- I'm not convinced that\nthat's necessary.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HAGLER: But even if it were necessary,\nthere's -- the -- the facts in the record, and the\nreasonable expectation of how the program will work will\nyield Medicaid cost savings both by imposing prior\nauthorization on drugs that are more expensive than their\ntherapeutic equivalents, and also by making Maine --\nallowing people without insurance in the State of Maine to\npurchase their prescription drugs and become less likely\nto become disabled and financially eligible for Medicaid.\nQUESTION: Of the proposed regulations, is\nanything published? There was nothing before either court\nabout how this would be implemented, was there?\nMR. HAGLER: There were proposed regulations.\nThey are in the appendix. They have not been promulgated.\nThey were drafted, and they're --\nQUESTION: Before the district court?\nMR. HAGLER: Yes. They were handed up to the\ndistrict court, and they -- they should be in the court\nfile. They -- they are found on page 278 of the appendix,\nand that provision describes how Maine will go about\nreviewing the drugs for prior authorization. If a\nmanufacturer refuses to participate in -- in a Maine Rx\nnegotiation, then the Commissioner will hand a list of --\nof that manufacturer's drugs to a committee of physicians\nand pharmacists who will determine whether it's clinically\nappropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization,\nguided constantly by the principle that the purpose of\nMedicaid is to provide necessary medical assistance to\nthose in need.\nQUESTION:\nMr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Stevens, I want to focus on the\nnarrowest basis on which this case can be decided, which\nis, we have a preliminary injunction that was issued by\nthe district court. A preliminary injunction was issued\non the basis of two bases, 1) the State has not put\nforward any Medicaid-related purpose to be served by Maine\nRx, and 2) that no matter how you want to define it, there\nis an obstacle to the full achievement of the recipient's\nprimary interest of receiving medicine.\nAs I said, there's a clear debate as to exactly\nthe extent of the obstacle, but that there could be no\nquestion that there is an obstacle, and it seems to me\nthat what this Court can do is simply say, those two\nfindings are not an abuse of discretion on the record in\nthis particular case, therefore there is a basis for\naffirming.\nIf the Court wants to go further from that and\nsay, on remand, some guidance might be useful from the\nSecretary of HHS and propose some mechanism by which to\nhave primary jurisdiction or some other mechanism devised\nby which to obtain the review by the Secretary, I think\nthere's probably no problem with that and, as I said\nbefore, I can't imagine that we would have any complaint\nabout that, but the importance of this is to -- is to\nretain the injunction in place so that the unquestioned\nharms that are going to happen are not allowed to take\nplace, and then try to undo them after the fact, which was\nthe reason for issuing the injunction.\nQUESTION: A brief question, I don't -- I'm\nworried about your time, but is it inconceivable to say\nthat there was no showing at the time of the preliminary\ninjunction hearing but now they -- Maine says they can\nmake the showing that they should have made before.\nShould the judge not listen to that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think when you get past\nthe preliminary injunction and you move on to the\npermanent injunction, if they think that they can show no\nburden whatsoever, or if they think they can show that\nthere are greater purposes to be served, that's certainly\navailable to them. But on an abuse of discretion standard\nthis Court ought to affirm that, and nothing that the\nFirst Circuit said justifies taking any action in this\nparticular case.\nIf there are no other questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
