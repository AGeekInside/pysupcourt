        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-289, Horne v. Flores and the\nconsolidated case.\nMr. Starr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn January of 2000 the district court in\nArizona concluded that the Nogales school system had\nfailed to provide an equal educational opportunity for\nits English language learners in that particular\ndistrict.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I thought the\ndetermination was that it had failed to provide funds\nthat could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan\nwhich the district itself had adopted.\nMR. STARR: Well, Your Honor, the specific\nfinding was that there needed to be -- there were very\nelaborate findings here. There needed in fact to be\nremediation to in fact support a plan, and the State --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the district agreed on\nthat, I take it. The district said, you've got to do\nsomething. This is our plan.\nAnd I thought the district court then\nsaid -- the school district did that, and I thought the\ndistrict court then said, well, the -- the funding that\nyou have come up with, or the funding scheme you have\ncome up with simply is not rationally related to the\nplan that you, yourself, have adopted. Am I -- am I\nwrong on that?\nMR. STARR: You are correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STARR: It needs to be a rational plan.\nBut then by the time of the 60(b) hearing, the\ncircumstances had dramatically changed. There had been\na failure. But in November of 2000, a sea change\noccurred in educational policy. The old system in\nNogales was done away with throughout the State.\nStrategic English Immersion, intense immersion, and the\nresults are already being shown. Nogales --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the year, Mr.\nStarr, the year of that change to the SEI from the\nbilingual education? What was the year of that?\nMR. STARR: The voters voted it in, in\nNovember of 2000, and it began feathering in very\npromptly as soon as the school districts could in fact\nrespond, and Nogales --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And yet the district\ncourt kept renewing his instruction, provide funding\nthat reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times\nafter the SEI became effective. And we -- we have the\noriginal decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment\nin 2000. Then he issues a series of order. None -- and\nnone of them are ever appealed.\nMR. STARR: That is true. And in fact one\nof the grounds of our submission this morning is that\nthe failure to appeal should be in fact a cause for\nconcern. Indeed, 60(b)(5) is all about exceptions to\nfinality, especially when we are dealing with a very\nquintessential State and local function, namely,\neducation.\nAnd, thus, the court should have been open\nto consider what the Ninth Circuit had commanded it\nconsider, namely the changed circumstances. And what\nwere those changed circumstances? Nogales was doing\ngreat. A new leadership came in. Superintendent Cooper\nmade tremendous reforms. The State responded, not only\nwith a new methodology, but by funding that methodology.\nAnd, Your Honor, all of this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Nogales was doing great? I\nmean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the\nrecord and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to\ntake an example, 77 percent of the English learners in\nNogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent\nstatewide. In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the\nreading exam compared with 34 percent statewide. In\n2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed\nin Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent\nstatewide.\nNow, I'm sure that progress has been made,\nbut it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing\n-- and the record is filled with that kind of thing --\nthat that -- that you could say that the objectives are\nachieved.\nMR. STARR: Your Honor, first of all, the\nexam to which you are referring is given in English. If\nI am taking German, then I am not going to do well in a\nGerman --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, isn't the point of\nthis to teach the children to learn English?\nMR. STARR: But the point is the -- the exam\nthat you should look at is the AZELA exam.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I am not\nfollowing this exchange because I don't understand\nwhether the -- the statewide percentage is the statewide\npercentage of English learners or the statewide\npercentage of all students.\nMR. STARR: Here is -- and I think we can\ncut to -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you can't answer that, I\nthink Justice Breyer can. But I would like to know what\ncomparison --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He doesn't actually have\nthe right to ask me questions.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't. That's -- that's\nexactly true. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Very much true.\nCounsel, why don't you try and answer?\nMR. STARR: Thank you.\nI would go, if I would -- if you would, to\npage 46a of our Pet. Ap, where you -- Petition Appendix,\nwhere you, in fact, get the information summarized, and\nthen go to -- and this is the Ninth Circuit's own words\nthat \"Nogales is doing substantially better,\" \"the State\nhas developed a significantly improved infrastructure.\"\nAnd then if you go to the superintendent's\nPetition Appendix, you will see -- this is the relevant\ninformation under No Child Left Behind, which is one of\nthe changed circumstances -- the Nogales students are,\nin fact, doing better than across the State. The key is\nto measure the progress that has, in fact, been made and\nthat is not disputed. Everyone agrees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I still don't\nhave an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess\nJustice Scalia's question following up on Justice\nBreyer's. What are the parameters or the -- the data\nwith respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?\nMR. STARR: Yes. The key, I would refer the\nCourt to Appendix 312 of the superintendent's petition\nand the prior pages. And that gives the percentage of\nstudents making progress under the exams that are\nadministered by the State statewide, and that you will\nsee that throughout, including in the high school, that\nthe students are, in fact, making progress. The\ndistrict court concluded that Nogales had --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer is\nthat Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect\nto the appropriate bases of children. You are just\nsaying that you want to use a different test than the\none that he was quoting?\nMR. STARR: Well, again, my quarrel with his\nfigures had to do with the nature of the test being\nexam. There are different tests being administered.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. The figures\nare accurate. You just think a different test should be\nused?\nMR. STARR: That one shouldn't take too\nseriously a test that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's take the\none you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention. The\none you mentioned, I take it the student academic\nachievement in mathematics, which is something called\nthe AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which\nyou mentioned. It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's\n2007 -- we have limited English proficient students,\nthis is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English\nlearners are at students scoring at or above proficient.\nThe overall rate is 68 percent. So it seems like about\na third.\nNow, if you look at the reading language\narts, the average is 73.5. Limited English proficient\nis 15.4. And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as\nto 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have\nmentioned.\nSo I just say -- my only point is that we\nhave a couple of findings here; you are right, they have\nmade progress, but they are not quite home yet. And I\nwould say that, looking at this record, it seems to\nsuggest that.\nMR. STARR: But not home yet, Your Honor,\nis, in fact, the key question. What is home? And that\nbrings us to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's do another one. What\nthey started out in the year 2000 is they said one\nproblem with this State is we don't know what it costs\nthe average -- the increased program. They haven't done\na good study to tell what it costs. But we think it's\nsomewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's\n$1400 per student. And as of this very moment, the\nState is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the\nschool district to find the rest of the money, which it\nhas to take from other things like English, or -- is\nthat right?\nMR. STARR: No, that is incorrect, Your\nHonor. First of all, there has been a substantial\nincrease in funding, which we supply and summarize at\npages 22 and 23 of the opening brief. And you will see\nthroughout the testimony -- the testimony is absolutely\nclear, including the plaintiffs', the Respondents', key\nwitness, Dr. Zumudio, agreed that there has, in fact,\nbeen substantial progress, indeed there is an effective\nprogram in place.\nAnd so our fundamental quarrel with the\napproach of the district court is it blinded itself to\nthe significant changes structurally as well as the\nprogress that had been made and just said it doesn't\nmatter because this is all about funding, and that is\nnot true.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Starr, can I take you\nback to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you\nseem to have shifted ground? The 60(b) motion as\npresented to the district court said that this new law\npassed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- \"2064 creates\na plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL\nstudents.\"\nThat was the whole basis for the 60(b)\nmotion, whether the new law was supplied adequate\nfunding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate\nintervened specifically for the purpose of defending the\nnew law. Your current argument is detached from the new\nlaw.\nMR. STARR: It is not detached, but our\nsubmission is, in fact, that we look to what the\ndistrict court had before it in the 60(b)(5) hearing.\nIt had an eight-day evidentiary hearing. It was not\nsimply legal argument over that particular bill. And\nthat evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was the basis\nfor the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate\nfunding.\nMR. STARR: Your Honor, there were a variety\nof points made, and the 60(b) submission was not limited\nto this new bill. Rather, it was a totality of the\ncircumstances, here are the changed circumstances.\nThat's what the whole eight-day trial was about. The\neight-day trial was about what are the new funding\nmechanisms, what is happening on the ground in Nogales.\nAnd as I say, even the Respondents' own key witness said\nthat there is an effective ELL program now in place, and\nthat, in fact, progress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we -- do we have\nthe -- the intervention application in the papers before\nus and the 60(b) motion?\nMR. STARR: Yes, you do -- you do have it\nbefore you. And there is no question that the Speaker\nand the President were, in fact, submitting to the\ndistrict court HB 2064 as part of the submission.\nMy point is the evidentiary hearing went\nmuch more broadly and here's the key: Under the EEOA,\nall that is required under the Castaneda framework is,\nin fact, good faith efforts toward compliance. The\nquestions that are flowing suggest there has been no\ngood faith effort at compliance, and there has been.\nThat's what the eight-day hearing was all about. That's\none of the things that Superintendent Cooper testified\nto and discredited.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- help me out\nthen. I thought the -- the issue was not whether there\nhad been any good faith attempt at compliance, but\nwhether there were two deficiencies under the scheme,\nunder the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill. One\ndeficiency was that it limited the funding for any given\nstudent subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding\nwhen, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get\na kid up to par with two years of education.\nThe second deficiency was that the -- that\nthe State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that\nFederal funds were being used to supplant what should\nhave been a State responsibility rather than merely\nsupplementing. I take it that is simply a matter of\ndegree, but that was the problem.\nI thought those were the two problems,\ntwo-year funding, supplantation. Am I -- am I wrong?\nSo there was no -- my point is that there was no denial\nthat some good faith efforts had been made. The finding\nwas that there were two deficiencies and these were the\ntwo deficiencies; is that correct?\nMR. STARR: As -- that is correct. But as\nto the latter with respect to the Federal funds,\nsupplant versus supplement, all that we have is -- and\nthis is an issue that is entrusted to the Department of\nEducation. It's not trusted to the district courts\nunder No Child Left Behind. This is an apparatus that\nCongress has determined there should no longer be -- not\nthat EEOA doesn't -- it has its beachhead, it has its\nplace, but now No Child Left Behind has a very elaborate\nprocess including a plan, and Arizona is in compliance\nwith that plan.\nThe point is the HB 2064 points completely\nblinded the district court to what was actually before\nhim, and we think that that is wrong.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Starr, how do you\nexplain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of\neducation are troubled by the same two points?\nMR. STARR: There is no question that there\nis disagreement within the house with respect to that.\nBut, Your Honor, there is no authority on the part of a\nFederal court under No Child Left Behind to render this\nkind of interpretation. And it has blinded us --\nultimately, it is irrelevant. It has blinded us to the\nissue --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is it -- No\nChild Left Behind I thought has a specific saving\nclause, \"Nothing in this part shall be construed in a\nmanner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a\ncivil right.\" And the EEOA is such a law.\nMR. STARR: That is correct. The point that\nI am making is the interpretation of supplemental versus\nsupplant is in fact one that is entrusted to the\nDepartment of Education. We only have a letter. That's\nnot final agency action. But I want to return to what\nwe think is the key in a 60(b)(5) hearing.\nWhat is key in 60(b)(5) is to listen to the\nchanged circumstances. What are the changed\ncircumstances? And the Court blinded itself to these\nvery important changes in terms of State funding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the one State\nfunding? Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23,\nand if I understand it correctly it says that the\neducational expenditures, that is to say monies,\nincreased in this Nogales and USD --\nMR. STARR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- maintenance and\noperation budget, by 30 percent. Well, I'm sure they\ndid. But that's I take it the entire maintenance and\noperation budget. The numbers I had -- and I am quite\ninterested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that\nI have is that the only survey they've done across the\nState, or the most recent one, says that the English\nlanguage instructional costs range between 1570 and\n$3300 per pupil. And then if you look at the amount the\nState provides outside of the reading, writing and\narithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all\nstudents, what they provide is -- currently it's $340,\nand if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would\nhave been $450. Now, are those numbers totally wrong?\nMR. STARR: The numbers are not wrong, Your\nHonor, but the numbers are in fact not the pivotal\npoint. The EEOA is not a funding statute, and let me\ncome to the specific point of cost studies. The State\nof Arizona did in fact seek to undertake a statewide\ncost study. And our -- one of our fundamental problems\nhere is this case is no longer about Nogales. It has\nbeen expanded. Even though it was a class action\nlimited to Nogales, it has been expanded to include an\nintrusion into the prerogatives of the State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the fault of the\nArizona attorney general, who told the court: You\ncannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona\nConstitution the -- all -- all the school districts have\nto be treated equally. So, it wasn't the plaintiffs\nthat initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in\nfact the Arizona attorney general.\nMR. STARR: And we are now seeking relief\nfrom that, because what we now know --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it should -- has the\nstate law changed?\nMR. STARR: What has changed --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, the reason -- the\nreason for getting into this is that the State required\nit. Has the State law changed?\nMR. STARR: The State law does not require\nspecific earmarked funding, district by district, and\nhere's the key --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, we are not talking\nabout -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I also assume the State law\ndoes not require that any -- any judicial decree with\nrespect to a particular district be expanded to the\nwhole State. It seems to me you could comply with the\nState Constitution. If and when a judgment is rendered\nas to the district, it would then be, under the State\nConstitution, the responsibility of the State executive\nto make sure that the other -- other districts are\nequalized.\nBut why the attorney general had to come\ninto the Federal court and say, do it to the whole\nState, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I\ncan't understand that, to tell you the truth.\nMR. STARR: It's why the district\ncourt should have been on guard --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the district court\nsupposed to do? The attorney general for the State\ncomes in and says, do it this way. It seems to me that\nthe State has no standing later on to say: Oh, gee, the\ndistrict court should have said: Sorry, Mr. Attorney\nGeneral; you don't know anything about your State law;\nwe won't do it this way.\nMR. STARR: Your Honor, we are not trying to\nrelitigate the original judgment. We quarrel with it,\nbut that's not why we're here. We're here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The fact is he wanted to be\nthrown into the briar patch, didn't he?\nMR. STARR: It was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State attorney general\nwanted the decree.\nMR. STARR: There is -- there is no question\nthat there was a division of the opinion within the\nState and that in fact the attorney general was\nessentially siding with the plaintiffs in their\nlitigation. There is now a very different perspective\nand you have that before you, that the governor who\ncontrols the litigation in the State is the chief\nexecutive of the State in terms of determining what the\nState's position is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me what\nyour submission is with respect to the error you see in\nthe findings and the order made after the eight-day\nhearing? First, are you saying that after No Child Left\nBehind that the duty of the State with respect to\neducating the students who have a different language was\nless onerous?\nMR. STARR: No, it's not less onerous, but\nthere is a different methodology and a different\napproach.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. And are you\nsaying that because of that methodology any remedy based\non funding is no longer appropriate?\nMR. STARR: A funding remedy is in fact\ninappropriate presumptively statewide. That is our key\nsubmission, because of the variation in costs, district\nby district.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we could -- is it valid\nas to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?\nMR. STARR: Not in terms of changed\ncircumstances, because of what has in fact happened on\nthe ground. Namely, one of the thing when we go back to\nthe original order --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You lost me.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying -- are you\nsaying that the order the district court gave with\nrespect just to Nogales --\nMR. STARR: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is inappropriate\nbecause it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of\ncompliance when it should have used blank, and then fill\nin the blank?\nMR. STARR: Yes. It should have simply\ndetermined under Castaneda the three-part test. It\nshould not have said the EEOA requires a particular\nlevel of funding. That's precisely what Castaneda --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that isn't what it -- I\ndon't understand that it has ever said that. I thought\nthe funding point was basically this: You, Nogales,\nhave come up with plan A. You have come up with funding\nB. Funding B is not enough money to fund plan A. It is\nyour plan, you've got to fund your plan.\nThat is not saying that the Federal statute\nrequires a particular level of funding. It's not saying\nthat the district court can take over the responsibility\nof deciding what is appropriate funding in a school\ndistrict. It's simply saying, \"If you choose plan A,\nyou have got to pay for plan A.\"\nMR. STARR: And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am I -- am I wrong? Did it\never go beyond that?\nMR. STARR: It did go beyond that in this\nsense. It did not in fact determine whether in fact\nthere was an effective program in place. That's the\noddity about this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, it should\nhave said: Before I decide whether your funding for\nplan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan\nA itself is worth anything? I mean, I have got to\nevaluate plan A?\nMR. STARR: No. The difficulty is seeking\nto enforce a specific funding order, and particularly\nstatewide, which intrudes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's go back\nto Justice Kennedy's point a moment ago. Let's just\ntalk about Nogales for a minute. With respect to plan\nA, that was Nogales' plan. And the district court said:\nYou can't fund that plan with the amount of money that\nyou have appropriated. Did the district court go beyond\nthat with respect to Nogales?\nMR. STARR: The district court failed to\nnote that plan A had changed. There was no longer a\nplan A. It was strategic English immersion which has an\nentirely different methodology. And what it also --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that came in in 2000\nand this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years\nbefore there was ever an argument. I mean in all of\nthese orders that were not appealed, don't those\njudgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?\nMR. STARR: Of -- of course. They let that\njudgment stand during that period of time. But the\nwhole purpose of 60(b)(5) is relief from finality. It's\na --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but didn't -- didn't\nthe court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they\nhave a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act. But\ndidn't the -- didn't the district court find that the\nfunding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons\nthat were mentioned earlier?\nMR. STARR: Well, it said that -- here is\nwhat the court held: That it has developed a\nsignificantly improved infrastructure for ELL\nprogramming, but it has not complied with the original\njudgment. That is our complaint. The original funding\njudgment was in fact informed by a different methodology\nand a different set of circumstances. For example,\nSuperintendent Cooper comes in and says: I don't want\nto spend money on teachers' aides; they are standing in\nthe way. Yet the Respondents say: We need money for\nteachers' aides. That's part of No Child Left Behind.\nInputs -- now we look at -- we test, we\ndetermine what progress is being made and, we are\nrequiring progress to be made.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't think there was\nin the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this\nmuch on teachers aides, that much on the other. It was:\nYou need a plan and you have to figure out how much it\ncosts, and then you have to appropriate money that\nmatches the cost.\nBut the district court -- I may be wrong\nabout this, but I thought that the original declaratory\njudgment didn't try to tell them what the components of\nthat plan had to be.\nMR. STARR: You are precisely right, but the\npoint I'm making is that the objects of that underlying\ndecree shifted by virtue of the new methodology that was\nin fact adequately funded through a whole variety of\nfunds. The funds that Justice Breyer has referred to\nare only part of the basket of funds that have been made\navailable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But doesn't it --\ndoesn't it -- don't we come back to Justice Scalia's\nquestion of a moment ago? Even with the -- the changed\nplan to immersion, isn't the finding that two years of\nfunding per child is not enough? And you are\nsupplanting, not supplementing. Isn't that still the\nproblem?\nMR. STARR: We believe not. We believe that\nultimately those two issues are irrelevant to the issue\nthat is before the Court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But those are the issues\nthat the court focused on; are they not?\nMR. STARR: Wrongly, because that's --\nthat's part of our quarrel, THAT the district court\nsimply focused on these two elements of HB 2064, and\nblinded itself to the evidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is a minor thing that\nI -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said.\nI thought that the funding order was not fund the plan\nyou come up with; but rather, come up with a funding\nplan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the\nplan you come up with. So is that right?\nMR. STARR: That is correct, and that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And now the\ndistrict court is at considerable remove. He says they\nhave not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems\nsatisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is\nrational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully\ndeveloped, though they've made progress. That's where\nwe are -- is that where we are?\nMR. STARR: Three brief points. On the\nstudy, the State did undertake a study, and this is in\nthe record. And the National Conference of State\nLegislators said: We throw up our hands because we\ncan't do this statewide. I would invite the Court to\nrefocus on Nogales as a district versus statewide.\nWhat was entered here in this order, which\nmakes it so extraordinary, is that the entire State\nfunding mechanism has been interfered with by the order.\nThis case started out in Nogales. And so the statewide\nstudy was in fact undertaken. But we could not do it.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures said: We\nthrow up our hands. We can do a local study, and it was\ndone. And if the Court refocuses on the various\ntranches of funding, including in Nogales itself and\nfrom the State, one will see that there has been a very\nsubstantial increase in the actual funding as well as\nprogress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I agree with\nthat. I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit\nthat applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the\nState attorney general wanted that done.\nMR. STARR: But we should be able now to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- that's water\nover the dam. That's not what this suit is about now.\nMR. STARR: No, Your Honor, not under 60(b),\nand this Court has warned about the ability of State\nofficials --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What has 60(b) got to do\nwith the question of whether the attorney general\nrepresents the State before the court? If the attorney\ngeneral comes back into court and says, no longer do we\nwant this statewide, then you've got an issue. If the\n-- if the attorney general speaking for the State does\nnot do that, then I don't see why Justice Scalia's point\nis not the answer.\nMR. STARR: Not under Arizona law. It is\nthe governor who speaks and the attorney general is\nbeholden --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the district court is\nsupposed to referee a fight between the governor and the\nattorney general at this point? Is that what's going\non?\nMR. STARR: No, Your Honor. The district\ncourt is to listen to what the State has to say through\n-- once the legislature was fine. It was brought in.\nIt should have listened to the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't the attorney\ngeneral speak for the State?\nMR. STARR: No, Your Honor, not in Arizona.\nThe attorney general speaks for the State when the\ngovernor directs him or her to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he was speaking alone\nfor years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said\nover and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal.\nWhat wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by\nFederal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a\nstatewide system of English acquisition programming.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which would be good enough\nto fix Nogales. So you are quite right. There is a\nvast difference in each district. But that attorney\ngeneral wanted enough money to fund the whole State the\nway you have to fund to -- to fix Nogales. That's what\nhe wanted.\nMR. STARR: And former officials shouldn't\ncontinue to be able to bind the State. I would like to\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nWhen the district court issued its initial\njudgment in 2000, what the court found was that there\nwas a systemic violation of the EEOA. And the court\nfurther found that the program deficiencies were the\nresult of the lack of funding rationally related to the\nprograms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask whether the\nrequirements of the EEOA are at all affected\nby Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left\nBehind Act? I mean, you know, it's a very vague\nrequirement that you make a good faith effort to -- to\nprovide language assistance to children.\nWhy shouldn't the courts decide that what\nconstitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what\nCongress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child\nLeft Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are\ndoing okay?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Scalia, just one\npoint of clarification on -- in our view on what the\nEEOA requires, and then I will address the No Child Left\nBehind point. The EEOA doesn't really require good\nfaith efforts. It requires efforts that are in fact\nreasonably calculated to overcome language barriers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I would call that\ngood faith, but that's fine.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: With that -- With that\nclarification, thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: With that clarification on\nthe question of whether No Child Left Behind sets the\nstandard for compliance with the EEOA, which is, I\nthink, what the petitioners' position is, we think the\nanswer is no for two fundamental reasons. First is just\na textual point. The text of No Child Left Behind\ndoesn't say anywhere that it displaces the standards for\ncompliance with the EEOA.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't think that's their\nargument, counsel. I don't think that it is their\nargument that No Child Left Behind supplants the earlier\nact. It is simply their -- their argument is that it\ninforms an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which\nis that the State is required to take appropriate\naction, which is a very vague standard.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think their argument at\nthe end of the day, Justice Scalia, is that if you\ncomply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in\na moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can\nmean -- then you have necessarily complied with the\nEEOA. That compliance with the No Child Left Behind\nsets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.\nAnd I don't think that is workable\nparticularly when you take into account what petitioners\nmean by \"compliance with No Child Left Behind.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question\nabout the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are\nreviewing? Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate\nabout how well Nogales is doing at this time. But let's\nsuppose Nogales came in, and they said this: We had\nplan A back when this was originally litigated, and now\nwe have an entirely different plan, and this plan\ndoesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending\nin 2000. But it is a very good plan, and it has\nproduced very good results.\nAs I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they\nwould not grant relief from the judgment under those\ncircumstances, because they focus exclusively on\nincremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's\nfunding model. Isn't that correct?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- I don't know\nthat that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA. What\nwe would say is that if the State came forward with a\nshowing that completely regardless of funding the\nprograms on the ground work, well, that would be\nsomething that the district court would have to take\ninto account. But the state hasn't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but isn't -- that isn't\nreally my question. Isn't -- isn't it the case that the\nNinth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief\nunder 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding\nand Arizona's funding model?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The Ninth Circuit focused\non funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the\ncase has been litigated from the outset. And that's the\nway the State has said from the outset that it would\nachieve compliance with the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's the way it was\nlitigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of\nthe motion for relief from the judgment was: We have a\nnew plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will\nproduce good results without looking at incremental EEL\nfunding. And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look\nat that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the Ninth\nCircuit was -- was required certainly to review the\ndistrict court's inquiry into that. And what the\ndistrict court found is at page 100-A of the appendix to\nthe petition filed by the legislative intervenors. And\nwhat the district court found there is that the\nimprovements today, although significant, failed to\nreach the high school; that they were fleeting. And --\nand this is particularly significant. In addition, the\ndistrict court also explained that it was premature to\nmake an assessment of many of the changes, because many\nof the new standards are still evolving.\nAnd the reason the district court said that\nis that -- is because of the enactment in 2006 of\nArizona HB 2064, which changes the framework for\nadministration and funding of ELL programs in a way that\nI think fortifies the district court's denial of\ncomplete dissolution of its judgment and -- and ensuing\norders.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess, as I\nunderstand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order\nis based on funding a particular plan and the State\ncomes back and says, this is a new approach. It could\nbe for any number of reasons, and say that, you know,\nthe plan is not working, or there have been other\nbudgetary crises in the State that strain what we can\nafford to spend on this particular program. Here's\nanother plan. The funding levels are different. You\nshould look at it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's wrong with\nthat?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There is nothing wrong with\nthat, and it should be looked at. And the district\ncourt did look at it, and what the district court found\nwas that the claims of progress, although there had been\nprogress, the progress hadn't reached the high school.\nThe progress was fleeting and that it was premature --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not a question\nof progress; it's a question of the plan and the\napproach. And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm\nlooking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific\nfunding that was based on the prior order. And what I\nunderstood the State's submission to be -- look at what\nthe superintendent has done in this particular case, and\nso on, so that those specific funding levels aren't\napplicable. And I would have thought it an\nextraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell\na State legislature: Pass this budget, and you,\nLegislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor,\nsign it, or you are not going to be in compliance. And\nif they've come up with a different way with different\nfunding requirements, I don't know why that's not a\nchanged circumstance that justifies looking at the\njudgment --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the district court\ndidn't issue that sort of order. And -- and the Ninth\nCircuit -- if you look at page 66a -- it did review the\nevidence in the record and fortified the district\ncourt's conclusion that the new plan, Your Honor,\nMr. Chief Justice, that was presented, which is to the\neffect that, regardless of funding, we have made\nadvances based on management improvements that should\nsatisfy the statute. That was the claim that was made\nby Petitioners. I think that's what you're alluding to.\nAnd the district court rejected that at page 100a, and\nthe Ninth Circuit fortified the district court's\nrejection of it by looking at the evidence in the record\nconcerning --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page is this?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's at 66a. That the\ncourt of appeals reviews the testimony and fortifies the\ndistrict court's conclusion that, based on the advances\nto date, there's still work left to be done. Because at\nthe end of the day you have to have a plan in place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't think\nthe State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree\nthat there's still work to be done. I thought that the\nplan -- the point was that their approach had changed,\nincluding by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have\nto reach the same specific funding levels that the\ndistrict court order required. And what I understood\nthe Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding\nlevels are still in place.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there's two\nfundamentally different assertions being made by\nPetitioners, if I understand it: One is what\nJustice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No\nChild Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way\nsuch that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as\nit is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.\nNow, there's a distinct argument that's also\nbeing made which is that conditions on the ground have\nimproved as a consequence of management improvements.\nRegardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual\nargument, that factually things have changed in a way\nthat ought to let us from underneath the district\ncourt's supervision.\nNow, the -- they are different points, and I\nthink the district court addressed both of them. With\nrespect to the second one, where there is the facts on\nthe ground, what is critical is that, in order to\njustify complete dissolution in a case like this, the\nPetitioners would have to show, not only that conditions\nhave improved, but they have improved in a way that is\ndurable and sustainable over time. And the district\ncourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What degree --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- doubted that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What degree of improvement\ndo you think is necessary? Do you agree with the Ninth\n-- the Ninth Circuit says, \"We cannot say the district\ncourt clearly erred when it found this burden was not\nmet. A district in which the majority of ELL tenth\ngraders failed to meet State achievement standards while\nthe majority of native English speakers passed is not\none whose performance demonstrates that the State is\nadequately funding ELL programs.\"\nDo you really think that you haven't\ncomplied with adequate funding of ELL programs until you\nraise all of the ELL students up to the level of native\nEnglish speakers?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think the EEOA\nrequires raising everyone. I think it requires --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's all this says.\nThe majority doesn't --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't meet the -- a\nmajority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the\nstandards, but the majority of native English speakers\ndo.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's part of what\nit says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also\nalluding to with respect to the high school in\nparticular that, if you look at State survey that\nPetitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in\ncertain schools, it also with respect to the high school\nshows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked --\nwere ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL\nstudents.\nSo there's problems on the ground, but what\nthe district court focused on concerns the enactment of\n2064, which is that no matter was think about the\nimprovements that have -- that have been made to date,\nthe landscape fundamentally shifts upon the enactment of\n2064 because the administration and funding of ELL plans\nchanges at that point. And it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the new plan that\nwe're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references\n-- well, now they have a new plan. Does everybody agree\nat least that the new plan is 2064?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I think we would agree\nbecause that sets the charter for provision of programs\nto ELL students going forward from its enactment.\nThat's the infrastructure from -- from here on out.\nAnd that -- there's three particular\nfeatures of that that I think are significant and that\nfortify the district court's conclusion that complete\ndissolution was unwarranted.\nThe first is the one that was raised by\nJustice Souter, which is that whatever you think of the\nprogress that has been made to date -- and the district\ncourt found that, while it was significant, it didn't\nsuffice -- that changes from what can be brought to bear\nfrom here on out as half the resources that were\navailable before, because that's the net effect of 2064.\nThat's what the district court found, at pages 107 to\n108a of the Petition Appendix. And when you have half\nresources to work with -- at the very least I think what\nthe district court thought in saying that it was\npremature to make an assessment is that we have to have\nsome period to assess what happens on the ground as a\nconsequence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- of this new funding\nrecipe.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does -- then does\nthat stay true without regard to what is happening\neconomically to the State? In other words, the district\ncourt can say: You've got to spend this much money on\nthis program, and I don't care what it means for jails,\nroads, anything else, when there are profound changes in\neconomic circumstances of the sort that everybody's\nexperiencing lately.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, the -- the district --\nthe State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I\ndon't believe the State to have done that so far. But\nthe State would have to make the argument that funding\nconstraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow\nus to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an\noptimal program, and so here's the program that we want\nto put in place in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- jurisdictions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it bizarre that we\nare sitting here talking about what the whole State has\nto do on the basis of one district which is concededly\nthe district that has the most nonnative English\nspeakers and has been a problem district all along. And\nwe are saying whatever this district court says for --\nfor this school district applies statewide. Now, that\nis bizarre.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the mere fact that the\nState Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind\nof a system at the outset, does that force us to still\naccept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for\nNogales is also necessary for the entire State?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Scalia, I think\nthat that issue becomes largely an academic one for the\nfollowing reason: that the reason that the State\nAttorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is\nthat, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding\ndecisions don't vary from district to district. So\nwhatever funding menu is put into place in order to\nachieve compliance with the EEOA with respect to Nogales\nis going to be the same one that exists throughout the\nState.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll let --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll let Arizona worry\nabout that. It's -- it's another matter to have a\ndistrict court decree that the whole State has to do\nthis thing. And whether -- whether it's done equally or\nnot would be a matter for the State courts to determine,\ninstead of for this district judge to determine, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it could be, but I\ndon't think there's really much of a dispute that the\nstatewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the\nState's going to do in this case, because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me very\nodd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision\nwhich says funding must be equal in each district. Then\nyou find one district that's way behind, and that is, we\nwill assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing\nlanguage education. You are saying that if the court\norders more money spent for that district, it must\nautomatically order money -- additional money for every\nother district in the State?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely not. Not --\ncertainly not in the abstract.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- yes, but that seems\nto me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the\nanswer you gave Justice Scalia.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think it's a\nnecessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy. I\nthink it's a conclusion that rests on we are in this\nlitigation in this particular context, given the Arizona\nConstitution's uniformity clause. It's as a consequence\nof that clause that this issue even arises. And I think\nthe Attorney General --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, what you're --\nyou're saying that any time a district court in a single\ndistrict orders more money to remedy a constitutional\nproblem, that because of that clause it has to apply to\nevery other district. That just can't be.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if -- and if it is,\nthen that is a very good reason for the district court\nto cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if the litigation had\ncome up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that\nit had always focused exclusively on what happened in\nNogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I\nthink what would have been appropriate is that the\ndistrict court would have inquired about what funding\nresources belong to Nogales in particular. And then\nwhat would have happened by operation of State law would\nbe that, whatever the funding calculus with respect to\nNogales, it would automatically apply across the State\nbecause of the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause.\nNow, in this case, the litigation -- the\ncomplaint was assessed against the entire State, and the\nAttorney General accepted that, and I don't think at\nthis point in time we can revisit that, particularly\nwhen it's largely an academic question given the\nuniformity clause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I gather it's\noften the case in institutional litigation of this sort\nthat the political figures, whether it's the Governor or\nthe Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look,\nwe should spend more money on this. So they go to the\ndistrict court judge and say, make us spend more money\non this. And they get the same result they'd wanted in\na non-democratic way, particularly when there's a\ndivision, such as here the legislature doesn't want to\ndo something, and the Governor or the Attorney General\ndoes.\nSo why should we put a lot of weight on what\nthe representation is when we are at least concerned\nthat it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative\nsense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, two points,\nMr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to\nquibble, but the Attorney General did contest the\nlitigation at the outset. What happened is, after a\njudgment was issued against the State, then I think\nthere was an acquiescence in the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's hard for\nthe Attorney General to get funding from the legislature\nfor all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get\nit, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't\nhave a choice.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, sure,\nMr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in\nboth Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns,\nand it accommodated the interest in finality that comes\nfrom judgments, and the interests in allowing a\ndifferent set of State officials to suggest new programs\nto make that suggestion to the district court. And it\naccommodated those in a way that requires a showing at\nthe outset that there has been a significant change in\nfacts or a significant change in law. And on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask just a\nquestion that was confusing to me? What standard for\nchanged circumstances do you understand the Ninth\nCircuit to have applied?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The one that was outlined\nby this Court in Rufo.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: A significant change of\nfacts or a significant change of law. And the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am looking at page\n72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they\nuse there is radically changed, not significantly\nchanged.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, on page 49a they\ninvoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for\nthat proposition, and also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if we have a --\nif we are confused as to which standard they applied,\nbecause at one point they say significantly changed and\nat another point they say radically changed, what should\nwe do?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- I would give\neffect to the articulation of the standard in the\nstandard review question section of the opinion. Of\ncourse you could remand if you felt that it was\nnecessary, but I think the reason why the Ninth Circuit\nuses the language such as Your Honor found in 72a is\nthat it has to be considered in the context of the\nnature of the violation and the nature of the relief\nsought.\nThe violation was a systematic one; the\nrelief sought is a complete dissolution of the judgment\nand ensuing order, and in that context I think it is\nfair to say that what is significant is more significant\nthan what would be the case in -- for example, in Rufo,\nwhere what was sought was a relatively modest\nmodification of the consent order concerning whether you\nwould have single bunking or double bunking.\nNow on the question of whether there is in\nfact a significant change or significant change of facts\nor significant change in law, on No Child Left Behind,\nJustice Scalia, to return to the question that you\nasked, the reason that No Child Left Behind in our view\ndoesn't displace the standard for EEOA is that\nPetitioner's standard is that as long as the State has\nan approved No Child Left Behind plan, which is true of\nall 50 States, that they necessarily satisfy the EEOA;\nand what that would mean is that even if a State didn't\nimplement that plan, even if the State didn't -- didn't\n-- didn't have accountability measures that it in fact\nfollowed, that required school districts to achieve the\nannual measurement of progress that would be laid out in\nthe plan -- notwithstanding all of that, a plaintiff\nwould lack authority to come into the court and litigate\nhis private cause of action under the EEOA and get a\ncourt order that requires the State to take appropriate\naction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right but --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- simply because the State\nwill have had an approved plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. You\ncould get the plan approved and then not fund it. But\nat least the additional funding demanded by the district\ncourt should be whatever additional funding is necessary\nto comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. Right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I don't think so.\nBecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then it's not\nas simple as you made it. Of course, I agree with the\nfact that if you get approved under the No Child Left\nBehind Act and then don't fund it, of course that --\nthat won't satisfy your obligation. But if you have\ngotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying\nyour obligation should be how much money would it cost\nto implement the program that you have gotten approved\nunder the No Child Left Behind Act.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The -- the No Child Left\nBehind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular\nprogram. What it imposes are voluntarily accepted\nfunding conditions, and that includes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't approve\nprograms?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the States had to\nsubmit a program.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: What the EEOA concerns are\nprograms that are reasonably calculated to achieve\novercoming language barriers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: What No Child Left Behind\nconcerns is, is there a testing program in place that\ncalls for certain improvements in testing over time. As\nlong as the plan describes the tests that will be taken\nand the progress that will be achieved or sought to be\nachieved over time, a plan will be approved. Now, even\nif the State doesn't achieve the plan -- the progress\nthat is called for by No Child Left Behind --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you are saying you can't\ncalculate costs.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot calculate costs\nunder the plan approved by the Secretary --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because all the plan is\nis testing.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. It's about tests.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And even if you don't make\nthe progress -- and if I could finish this one point,\nMr. Chief Justice. And it bears noting that the Nogales\nthe progress called for No Child Left Behind hasn't been\nmade in the last two years, according to the\nsuperintendent's web site. Even if you don't make that\nprogress, there is no way under Petitioner's approach to\nvindicate the EEOA cause of action to obtain appropriate\naction.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nOF BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's important to recognize what Petitioners\nasked for here at the rule 60(b)(5) stage. That was\ncomplete dissolution of the court's immediate orders.\nIt was not to just limit those orders just to Nogales;\nit was not to improve -- or to approve improvements in\nNogales as an interim measure. As a result, the burden\nwas on them to show either full compliance with the\norders the district court had entered or material\nchanged circumstances that made compliance unnecessary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't the district\ncourt give them the relief to which they were entitled\neven if it was less than what they sought?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Certainly. But they didn't\ndemonstrate that -- entitlement to that relief either.\nTo the extended we are talking about the question of\nwhether conditions had changed in Nogales that there was\nno longer an ongoing violation of Federal law, the\ndistrict court held an 8-day evidentiary hearing, and it\nmade factual findings showing that the problems had not\nceased in Nogales. And as you noted, Justice Ginsburg,\nthis changed circumstances argument that is now heavily\nrelied upon by Petitioners was not the primary thrust of\ntheir argument before the district court.\nThe primary thrust of their argument was\nthat HB 2064, which is the State's scheme for ELL\neducation, had some serious -- would -- would satisfy\nthe judgment; and their other argument was that No Child\nLeft Behind completely preempts -- that was the language\nthey use -- completely preempts and renders obsolete the\nEEOA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, when you\nwere starting out I heard you articulate a third\nstandard, materially changed. What is your\nunderstanding of the standard applied by the Ninth\nCircuit? Was it materially changed, significantly\nchanged or radically changed?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I understand it to be\nsignificant change, which, I don't see significant and\nmaterial as being all that different. I think that\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't either\nbut I see both of them being different from radically\nchanged.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think if you look at\nthe Ninth Circuit's opinion, particularly where it\nstarts out with the standard of review, it cites this\nCourt's precedents in Rufo and Agostini; it talks about\nthe need for significant changed circumstances. I\nunderstand that there are portions of the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion that say -- that have the radical\nchange language, and again, I -- I think that that\nlanguage is -- just reflects the arguments that\nPetitioners were making, that they wanted complete\nrelief from these remedial orders and that, you know,\nthe underlying judgment here was a systemic violation.\nI mean, it's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the district court on\nthe 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its\nincremental funding determinations that it had made\nearlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and\nto insist on compliance under the new immersion program?\nMS. SAHARSKY: If I understand your question\ncorrectly, and please correct me if I don't, but the\ndistrict court considered two different arguments. The\nfirst was under House Bill 2064 which considered to have\n-- which continued to have this incremental funding.\nIt's that we have two problems with House Bill 2064,\nwhich were the two-year cutoff and Federal funding\nproblem.\nOn the second question which -- the second\nargument Petitioners made which said, everything is fine\nin Nogales because we have money from other funds, the\ndistrict court said no, there's -- there's been an\nongoing violation of Federal. Law you haven't met your\nburden of showing me that violation ceased because\nthings aren't better in Nogales. Do --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why does it matter that\nthere is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL\nprograms exclusively? What difference does it make\nwhere the money comes from -- where it comes from,\nputting aside federal money that can't be supplanted? I\njust don't understand that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think the reason the\ndistrict court was focused on that because that was\nalways the State's position that, in terms of the\nstatewide scheme, that that is how they were going to\nfund ELL education. Now it -- and so the State was\nalways, from 2000 up to the time of the district court's\nrule 60(b) hearing, going down this path whereby it\nwould put in place an ELL program and then give this\namount of funding --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may have been\ntheir -- that may have been their position originally,\nbut at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference\ndoes it make whether the money came from funds that were\ndesignated for ELL program, or from general State funds,\nor from county funds? What difference does it make\nwhether the money was taken from some other program that\nthe school was operating?\nSuppose they fund -- they take the money for\nthe ELL programs from money that was previously used for\nmusic instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or\nanything else. Now those may all be bad things, but\nwhat does that have to be with the EEOA?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the district court\ncould have found that the plan had changed and that\nfunding could come from -- from different places.\nThat's right, if the State had changed its plans or that\nNogales otherwise would have sufficient funding from\ncircumstances that -- or from other source, that would\nbe one thing. But the district court found that Nogales\ndoesn't have that funding from other sources.\nFor example, it can't use the federal\nfunding that it -- that the Petitioners claim could be\nused to solve its problem under the EEOA. There are\nspecific conditions on federal grant programs that\nforbid that.\nIt also could not raise any significant\namounts of funding through county tax overrides, which\nwas another source the Petitioners had said would --\nwould provide sufficient funding. So the question the\ndistrict court had to ask is, there has been an ongoing\nviolation of federal law, has that violation of\nfederal -- federal law ceased because the State has put\nin place, Nogales has put in place programs that are\nreasonably calculated to help these kids learn English?\nAnd the district court said Nogales has\ncobbled together these sources of funding. And it is\ndoing the best they can.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the fact that you keep\ntalking about the district court emphasizes my concern\nabout the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what\nwe are reviewing. And as I read the decision of the\nNinth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental\ncosts associated with ELL programs and the educational\nfunding model that the State had at that time.\nMS. SAHARSKY: With respect, I don't think\nthat that was their exclusive focus. I understand that\nit was a primary focus of that decision, and the reason\nfor that was because the primary argument --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they say. They were\nrequired -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate\neither that there are no longer incremental costs\nassociated with ELL programs in Arizona or that\nArizona's funding model was so altered as to make\nincremental costs issue relevant. That was their\nexplanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's\nappendix.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's right. And what I\nunderstand that to mean is that they were required to\neither show compliance with the judgment which was that\nthey would put together a plan that funded ELL education\nbased on incremental costs or that the State was going\nto go down a different path and come up with the funding\nsome other way, and that would result in a program\nreasonably calculated to help ELL students earn English.\nAnd the district court found there were\nneither and the court of appeals found there were\nneither. And the court of appeals did go through the\nalleged changed circumstances, and Nogales had issued a\n91-page opinion that talked about the significant\nresource constraints that still exist in Nogales and the\npersistent achievement gaps that still exist in Nogales.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still have trouble\nwith the idea of district courts ordering State\nlegislatures to fund it. Isn't the preferable approach\nfor the district court to say you have a violation, you\nhave to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed\nit at particular intervals? And it's up to you, the\nState, to determine how you are going to fix it.\nAnd the State might change its mind. They\nmay start out by saying we have got all of this extra\nmoney and that's how we will fix it. Then there is a\nbudget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and\nhe says we can't the money, we are going to do it some\nother way, and here's the way.\nBut that's kind of the judgment of the\nState, not for the district court.\nMS. SAHARSKY: And I think the district\ncourt was appropriately differential to the State\nthroughout this litigation. You will note at the time\nof the 2000 judgment that the district court didn't put\nany remedial order in place. And that's because at the\ntime of trial the State said, look, we are going to put\nin place an ELL program that everyone in the State can\nuse and figure out how much it costs, what works and\nwhat doesn't. We are going to do a cost study, so\nplease let us do the cost study and we will come back to\nthe court.\nAnd the district court said fine. And ten\nmonths later that didn't happen.\nNow, there was a change, as Petitioners\nnote, to a different theory of ELL education, structured\nEnglish immersion and the court said, okay, do your\nprogram based on structured English immersion and just\ntell me how much it costs, tell me how you rationally\nfund it, and that will be fine. The district court here\ndid not want to be in the business of micromanaging\nState education. Through this entire litigation the\ndistrict court was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does it order\nthen -- why did its order specify and be linked to the\ntermination of the legislative session, and say you have\n12 days left in the session and that's how many days you\nhave to enact this budget?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think it's because the\nState kept coming back to the district court and saying\nthat the legislature had asked for this cost study,\nthere was an interim bill, House Bill 2010, where the\nlegislature said we put in place another study that we\nare going to perform. And it's because the State\nsaid -- constantly said the legislature is going to do\nthis cost study, figure out how much good programs cost,\nthe school -- the State board will be involved,\net cetera, that the district court entered its orders\nlooking to the time period in which it expected action\nto occur.\nI mean, this happened over a nine-year\nperiod. The district court, to be clear -- I think this\nis a very important point -- never said you need to do\nany special kind of ELL program, bilingual, structured\nEnglish immersion, you need to have any certain number\nof teachers, nothing like that. And it never said you\nneed to put this certain amount of funding in place,\n$200, $300 per student, anything like that.\nAnd Petitioners at the rule 60(b)(5) stage\nfaced a heavy burden to show if what they wanted to show\nwas that the State was now going to go down this new and\ndifferent path, because even at the time of the rule\n60(b)(5) hearing, the state Was on the same path. It\nhad just passed House Bill 2064, which just like at the\ntime of the 2000 judgment said we are going to put a\nstatewide program in place for ELL education --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district -- the\ndistrict judge said that that 2064 did not have enough,\nit raised it to 450 or whatever. And the district court\nsaid there are three things wrong with it, the two\nyears, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not\nsupplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough.\nAnd the only way that $450 figure was going\nto get changed was through legislation, right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Could I answer that? I think\nthe problem with the $450 figure is that the district\ncourt was never told what the State was planning to buy\nwith that, what that $450 was for. The State -- the\ndistrict court just said to the State, please tell me\nwhat your programs are going to do and approximately how\nmuch it costs to fund them. And that 450 wasn't tied to\nany particular ELL programs. That was the problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, I have one\nlate arriving question. Do you think that the\nconstitutional -- State constitutional provision at\nleast there has to be equivalent funding in districts,\ndo you think that would be called into play if the\nFederal Government under a federal program gave\nadditional funds to a particular district? Which I am\nsure it does, those districts that have federal\nfacilities probably get additional -- additional money,\nwould all the rest -- under this constitutional\nprovision, would all the rest of the State have to belly\nup to that -- to that same level?\nMS. SAHARSKY: No, as I understand it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt it.\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- when it's talking about a\nuniform --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- and equal amount, it's\ntalking about the amount that the State gives to the\nschool districts. It's not with respect to any federal\nfunding from other sources.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if federal funding\ndoesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable\nonly to a particular school district count?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that the idea was\nthat there needed to be -- the State determined that\nthere needed to be -- it was going to solve the problem\nstatewide not only because of the concern under the\nState constitutions, that it would provide for all ELL\nstudents. And it was not that it would provide the same\namount to each school district, but just the same amount\nper ELL student. That the State had decided that it was\ngoing to fill that responsibility because -- both\nbecause of the Constitution and because it's responsible\nfor supervising education statewide. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Starr, you have three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STARR: Thank you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me, Mr. Starr,\nbased on this last argument, that it actually is in your\nfavor if the order of the court as to one district\nautomatically requires additional expenditure for every\nother district, that is simply one more measure that the\nCourt should use in finding an alternate remedy.\nMR. STARR: Yes, Your Honor. The state\nfunding remedy here is extraordinarily intrusive and\noverreaching. It is something that has not been done\nunder the EEOA ever, and certainly the No Child Left\nBehind provision should inform now this particular\nremedy. The remedy was originally, of course, designed\nto address the situation in Nogales, but it was\nexpanded --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is no content to the\nequal child -- No Child Left Behind. There is no\ncontent to it. All it requires is testing.\nMR. STARR: It's part --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't say how much it's\ngoing to cost.\nMR. STARR: But, Your Honor, there is a very\nelaborate plan that is submitted and then a\ndetermination is made by the Federal Government about\nfunds under Title 1 and Title 3, but here is our\nfundamental submission. The Ninth Circuit simply\napplied the wrong 60(b)standard.\nIt, in fact, used this remarkable language,\nbut it also of radical change, but it also gave undue\nweight. It said it ten times to the fact that the\noriginal judgment was on appeal, and then it simply did\nnot pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a\nstatewide funding remedy in light of the fact that we\ncan now look at what has happened in Nogales. We see\nthe changes that have, in fact, been there, and\ncertainly the EEOA by its design in section 1712 of EEOA\nmakes it very clear that the remedial reach of the EEOA\nis quite limited. It's limited to particular\ncircumstances.\nHere the EEOA has been transmogrified to\napply statewide. That has not been done before. It\nshould not have been done in the first instance but\ncertainly in light of the changed circumstances.\nAnd the changed circumstances,\nJustice Ginsburg, go back to structured English\nimmersion. They did not begin with the passage of HB\n2064. Structured English immersion came in in the year\n2000. That is why the legislature then came in and put\nthese facts in evidence before the district court, which\nmade no factual findings statewide at all, ever. There\nare no statewide factual findings in this record\nwhatsoever, none. And therefore statewide funding\nremedy should not have been permitted. Sixty (b)(5)\nrelief should be granted. I thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
