        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 06-1164, John R. Sand & Gravel\nCompany v. the United States.\nMr. Haynes.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAYNES: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe plain English reading of Section 2501 of\nTitle 28, its phrasing compared to the jurisdictional\ngrants to the Court of Federal Claims, the\ncontemporaneous legal history of its predecessor, and\nthis Court's decisions in Irwin and Franconia Associates\ncompel the conclusion that Section 2501 does not limit\nsubject matter jurisdiction and should be applied to the\ngovernment as an ordinary waivable affirmative defense.\nThe plain text of Section 2501, which reads\n\"Every claim of which the United States Court of Federal\nClaims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the\npetition thereon is filed within 6 years\" after it first\naccrues, assumes subject matter jurisdiction, and if it\nassumes subject matter jurisdiction it cannot logically\nlimit subject matter jurisdiction. The statute is\nphrased in such a way that the jurisdictional inquiry\nprecedes the inquiry as to timeliness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the prior statutes have\na different structure?\nMR. HAYNES: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've held this thing is\njurisdictional for a long time. Did the prior statutes\nunder which we made those holdings have a different\nstructure?\nMR. HAYNES: The 1863 statute prior to the\nTucker Act amendment to the statute had approximately\nthe same structure, Your Honor, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you asking us\nto, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor\noverrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?\nMR. HAYNES: Your Honor, we believe that\nthis Court's decision in Irwin effectively overruled\nSoriano. Irwin held that the Title 7 statute of\nlimitations was subject to equitable tolling, and in\nIrwin, the Court had to choose between two lines of\ncases, Soriano and Bowen v. City of New York. And it\nchose the Bowen line of cases. And so if it repudiated\nSoriano -- Soriano of course held that Section 2501 is\njurisdictional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, Irwin\ninvolved Title 7 and not this 2501. And we hadn't\naddressed Title 7 before, but we have addressed 2501\nbefore.\nMR. HAYNES: That's correct. But certainly\nin Irwin, the Court uses 2501 as an example of a statute\nthat can be equitably tolled and in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in, in the\nmore recent case of Kontrick -- I'm looking at footnote\n8 of that opinion -- it used 2401 as an example of the\njurisdictional bar and 2401 has pretty much the same\nlanguage as 2501.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Section 2401 in the\nFederal Tort Claims Act has similar language.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think in Contracts it\nwas used as an example of a so-called built-in statute\nof limitations, one that is thought to bar the right as\nwell as the remedy.\nMR. HAYNES: Well, certainly one could look\nat the statute of limitations in 2401 that is within the\nsection that waives sovereign immunity and say that it\nas part of the waiver constitutes a limit on subject\nmatter jurisdiction. However, Section 2501 standing\nalone in the procedural chapter concerning the Court of\nFederal Claims is not attached to any particular waiver\ncontained in chapter 91, which contains the\njurisdictional grants to the Court of Federal Claims.\nSo --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just, just to\nget all the cases out on the table, our more recent\ndecision in Bowles suggested that there may be a\ndifference between statutory and rule limitations and\nalso suggested that the prior history of the\ninterpretation of a provision was highly relevant.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Bowles does say that, but\nBowles can be distinguished, I believe, in several ways.\nFirst, Bowles dealt with the notice of claim, notice of\nappeal and transferring the jurisdiction from the\ndistrict court to the court of appeals. That's not at\nissue here because in the statute of limitations, of\ncourse, we aren't dealing with transferring\njurisdiction, we're dealing with the initiation, the\ninitiation of the claim and which court that claim\nbelongs in, not transferring jurisdiction from one to\nanother.\nSecond, Bowles -- Bowles was very careful in\nnot mentioning statutes of limitations in, in the\nmajority opinion. It doesn't mention it at all and I\nthink that is, that is purposeful. Third --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It said determining when\nand under what conditions Federal courts can hear cases\nfalls within the court's adjudicatory authority -- or\nthat are within the adjudicatory authority are\njurisdictional, when and under what conditions Federal\ncourts hear cases. That would be very broad, but it did\nsay that.\nCould not interfere with the plain-text\nreading of 2501 once you assume --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What kind of language would\nwe have to find in 2501 in order to conclude that it's\njurisdictional? Would it be necessary for the statute\nto say that there is no jurisdiction unless the -- the\nclaim is filed within a certain period of time?\nMR. HAYNES: I think if Congress said that\n-- if Congress specifically said that this section, this\nstatute of limitations, is jurisdictional, that would\nend the issue. And as this case -- as this Court said\nin the Arbaugh case, if Congress plainly establishes a\nstatute as jurisdictional, then the court's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that necessary? Is there\nanything short of that that would be sufficient?\nMR. HAYNES: If Section -- if the language\nin Section 2501 were attached to the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity in 1491(a)(1) for this case, that might allow\nthe Court to find that it's jurisdictional and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then there would be a\nbuilt-in limitation, and usually that's not considered\njurisdictional. It would be under the heading of\nfailure to state a claim; that is, your claim has been\nextinguished, so you have no claim to state, as opposed\nto the ordinary operation of the statute of limitations\nwhich bars only the remedy, not the right.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But\ncertainly the example -- as the Chief Justice's example\nsuggested, in 2401, the Federal Tort Claims Act, and\nalso the statute that's found in the Quiet Title Act\nthat this Court interpreted in the Block case, Block v.\nNorth Dakota, those statutes of limitations are attached\nto the jurisdictional grant in some closer fashion than\n2501 is, and so they would more likely to be read to be\na limit on jurisdiction. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me all of those\nfactors are a lot more subtle than the mere fact that we\nhave said that this is jurisdictional for years and\nyears, it and its predecessor. Why -- why isn't that at\nleast as persuasive as the -- as the fragile attachments\nyou're -- you're discussing here or even as the -- as\nthe, you know, the -- even if the statute said that it's\njurisdictional, we've said in our opinions that to say\nit's jurisdictional doesn't mean that it's\njurisdictional necessarily. So I suppose we could say\nthe same about the statute, couldn't we?\nMR. HAYNES: Justice Scalia, I believe that\nthe Irwin case answers that question because Irwin\ncertainly undercut Soriano and Soriano relied on the\nKendall-Finn line of cases. Irwin made a choice, and it\nchose to say that the statute of limitations in Title 7\nand generally other statutes of limitation are presumed\nto be equitably tollable, and if they are equitably\ntollable they cannot be jurisdictional. 2501 was used\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say that. You're\nsaying that.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, we are saying that. We\nthink that there is a logic --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Bowles said that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Bowles said if it's\nequitably tolled, it's not jurisdictional. If it -- a\nprovision that is jurisdictional cannot be equitably\ntolled.\nMR. HAYNES: That's correct. And if it --\nif the statute can be equitably tolled, it's not\njurisdictional, and therefore it can be waived and --\nand it does not have to be raised sua sponte by the\ncourt, as was done here by the Federal Circuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One member of the court\ndid think that Irvin -- Irwin overruled Soriano, but\nonly one member.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, but I think a -- a fair\nreading of Irwin, combined with this Court's decision in\nFranconia Associates, which construed Section 2501 to\nsay that it doesn't have a special accrual rule for the\ngovernment and that this Court -- or that courts should\napply statutes of limitations against the government as\nagainst private parties --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a pretty risky\nbusiness, though, to rely on a dissent in determining\nwhether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not,\nisn't it?\nMR. HAYNES: It would be, Your Honor. I'm\nnot sure which case you're referring to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Irwin. I thought\nthat was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you --\nMR. HAYNES: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where Justice\nWhite in dissent said that Irwin overruled Soriano. But\nthe majority certainly didn't say that.\nMR. HAYNES: No, but -- it did not say that\nspecifically, but I think if you look at Irwin in the\ntotality, there is -- I don't think there is a way that\nyou could look at Irwin and say that it did not overrule\nSoriano. At a minimum -- at a minimum, it took out the\ntheoretical underpinnings for the Soriano line of cases.\nBecause --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you suggest we write\nthe opinion? If you were writing it and then a dissent,\nsay, or someone or we read in the briefs that here is an\nabsolute holding of the Supreme Court right on point,\ntotally clear, says just exactly what the government\nsays here, and it was codified in 1948, and now we say\nthe reason, despite that, you win is?\nMR. HAYNES: The reason is because, unless\nthe Congress clearly establishes a statute of\nlimitations as jurisdictional, unless there is a clear\nstatement, then statutes of limitations against the\ngovernment are to be read --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if somebody says, well,\nthe Court couldn't have been clearer as to what the\nstatute meant, and Congress reenacted it in codifying\nit. So what do you want?\nMR. HAYNES: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what could be\nclearer? Are they supposed to actually -- in the\nrecodification in 19 -- or is it that the recodification\nchanged things or what?\nMR. HAYNES: No, Justice Breyer, I don't\nthink the recodification changed the substance of the\nstatute. However, certainly that argument that\nCongress's recodification of this Court's ruling in the\nKendall-Finn line of cases cuts both ways because\nfollowing Irwin, issued in -- when the opinion was\nissued in 1990, the Congress has had 17 years to look at\nthat and say no, Section 2501 should not be equitably\ntolled. And Congress certainly could say that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it hasn't\nrecodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?\nMR. HAYNES: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. However, I think the recodification argument\nreally -- really is not a telling argument because the\nKendall-Finn line of cases, under Irwin at least, were\nwrongly decided when they were decided. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we do\nhave to overrule Kendall and Soriano?\nMR. HAYNES: I think in order to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or at least say that\nwe already did in Irwin?\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Your Honor. We believe\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it just Irwin or a\nwhole line of cases? There was a time when the\njurisdictional label was used rather frequently. There\nis a more recent case that says \"jurisdiction\" is a word\nof many meanings, too many meanings. And I think the\nCourt has been trying to cut down on the too many\nmeanings.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree,\nand those cases start with the Kontrick v. Ryan case and\ncontinue through -- and even in the Bowles case, that's\n-- that's a species of appellate jurisdiction which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But even all those cases\nwhich you're going back to, what you're talking about, I\nthink, in those cases is general statements in the case.\nThe cases themselves, except possibly for that\nFranconia, which has a different problem because it was\nabout accrual, the cases themselves don't involve this\nstatute. It's simply general statements. I thought,\nand I'd like your response, that in this Court's opinion\nas in statutes, as in life. When people make general\nstatements, they don't mean every possible situation in\nthe universe; rather, there are always circumstances to\nwhich the statement doesn't apply. And so why don't we\njust read those statements as incorporating a prior\nexplicit holding of the Court as inapplicable to that\nprior explicit holding? I mean, that's what you'd\nnormally do with a sentence like that, isn't it?\nMR. HAYNES: Perhaps, Justice Breyer. I\nthink that the rule that we are proposing here is that\nonce Congress has waived sovereign immunity, absent a\nclear statement of Congress to the contrary, a statute\nof limitations is not -- does not limit subject matter\njurisdiction. So I think the Court has to look at the\nplain language of Section 2501, compared to the\njurisdictional grant here in 1491(a)(1).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the rule or the\npresumption that you just quoted in effect when Congress\nlast revised the statute?\nMR. HAYNES: No, Justice Kennedy. I think\nthe presumption was -- was established certainly in\nIrwin, which said: We want to cut through these ad hoc\ndecisions that we have been going through on this\nquestion of equitable tolling. We want to -- we want to\ncreate a general rule that statutes of limitations\ngenerally are presumed to be equitably tolled.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can -- was\nCongress aware of that general rule when it last revised\nthe statute?\nMR. HAYNES: I don't see how that could\nhappen, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't, either, and\nthat's why, when you say, well, it's a general rule,\nwell, your argument tends to lose force because of the\nfact that Congress acts against the background of what\nthis Court has stated.\nMR. HAYNES: That may be. However, I don't\nthink that that general codification or -- or, rather,\nthe rule of statutory construction that says that the\nCongress's codification of the law will then incorporate\nthis Court's prior decisions, I don't think that can\ntrump the plain language reading of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Haynes, isn't it less\nradical and, indeed, more in accord with the language of\nIrwin to -- to say that what Irwin overruled was not the\nwhole principle that this statute of limitation is -- is\n-- and others that relate to sovereign immunity, is\njurisdictional, but rather the much more limited rule\nthat -- that statutes of limitations which are\njurisdictional are not subject to equitable tolling?\nThat's a much more limited point, and -- and\nthe language of Irwin is a waiver of sovereign immunity\nmust be unequivocally expressed once Congress has made\nsuch a -- once Congress has made such a waiver, we think\nthat making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to\nsuits against the government in the same way that it is\napplicable to private suits amounts to little, if any --\nlittle, if any -- broadening of the congressional\nwaiver.\nI don't think one can say that if you expand\nthe principle to cover the whole -- the whole matter of\nwhether it's jurisdiction. So why not read Irwin more\nmoderately to -- to -- if we have to overrule one of two\nthings, the whole doctrine of the jurisdictional nature\nof statutes of limitations in sovereign immunity cases\nand the other is simply, oh, yes, there is sovereign\nimmunity, but can there be equitable tolling, why\nshouldn't we adopt the more limited one?\nMR. HAYNES: Well, I think, Justice Scalia,\nthat this Court can adopt a more limited ruling based\nupon the rule that I've advanced, and that is if\nCongress specifically says that a statute of limitations\nshall count as jurisdictional.\nAnd the example I would give, Justice\nScalia, is in the Indian Tucker Act, which is found on\npage 9A of the appendix to the blue brief. The Indian\nTucker Act, Section 1505 -- excuse me -- section 1505,\nsays that claims that accrue to Indians after August 13,\n1946, go to the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of\nFederal Claims has jurisdiction over those claims.\nThat is -- and before that date, such Indian\nclaims went to the Indian Claims Commission. So in 1505\nCongress said before a date certain a particular forum\nhad jurisdiction; and after a date certain another forum\nhas jurisdiction. That's -- that's a jurisdictional\nkind of date that I think is -- is appropriate to look\nat here, because once -- once you put an -- you put\naccrual language in a statute of limitations, that by\nits nature suggests that there may be equitable tolling\nor some kind of tolling if you're talking about a claim\naccruing, because there may be estoppel, there may be\nwaivers, there may be discovery issues. So the text of\nthe statute itself suggests that there is a form of\ntolling allowed in the statute.\nAnd if Congress wanted to say that this\nstatute of limitations goes to the subject matter\njurisdiction of the court, it very well could have said\nthat. It didn't, however; and so I think Irwin fits\ncomfortably within the rule that we are suggesting.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's exactly\nwhat I think we said in -- in Arbaugh; and that,\ncertainly, going forward from that point on, Congress\nhas more or less specified that it's jurisdictional, or\nwe're not going to read it that way. But I'm not sure\nthat was the rule in Irwin and I'm pretty sure it wasn't\nthe rule in Soriano and Kendall.\nMR. HAYNES: Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly\nwas not the rule in Soriano and Kendall. But our\nposition is that in Kendall the Court ignored the\nlegislative history which said, this statute of\nlimitations that we are inserting into the 1863 Court of\nClaims Act should be treated -- should be applied to the\ngovernment just as to private parties.\nThat's precisely the ruling in Franconia\nAssociates: That once sovereign immunity has been\nwaived, once -- once there is a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity, the government is treated like any other\ndefendant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know, but it\nseems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up\ntoday, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's\nright.\nBut the point is it came up 100 years ago\nand it was decided, and the question is whether we\nshould overturn that decision.\nMR. HAYNES: I understand. Again, I suggest\nthat Irwin erased the theoretical underpinnings of the\nKendall-Finn line of cases by saying that a statute\nformerly -- which this Court formerly said was\njurisdictional can be subject to equitable tolling, and\nif it is subject to equitable tolling it cannot be\njurisdictional because the hallmarks of \"jurisdictional\"\nare strict construction, it can't be waived and\nforfeited, and it has to be raised sua sponte. And so\nif you take out one of those legs of the statute, I\ndon't see how it can be held to the jurisdictional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It did say statutory time\nlimits -- this is Irwin -- applicable to lawsuits --\nwell, the sentence about the suits: The rule of\nequitable tolling applicable to suits against the\ngovernment. It says the rule that was announced is\napplicable to the government, the same as with respect\nto private parties.\nSo it's hard to think of what territory\nIrwin would cover if it doesn't -- because in all suits,\nat least for money against the government, there has to\nbe a waiver of sovereign immunity.\nMR. HAYNES: That's true, Justice Ginsburg.\nAnd -- and Congress has specifically waived sovereign\nimmunity for the kind of claim involved in this case,\nwhich is, of course, a takings claim.\nOnce the waiver is accomplished, the\ngovernment is treated like any other defendant. That's\ncertainly what Franconia Associates says, and I think it\nis inescapable to say, to -- to conclude other than to\nsay that Irwin and Franconia have -- have eviscerated\nthe Kendall-Finn line of cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think your\nargument is more strongly supported by Irwin than\nFranconia. Franconia simply involved an accrual rule,\nwhich doesn't go to what the jurisdictional effect of\nthe bar on commencing a case is.\nThe government there was overreaching and\narguing for a special accrual rule, and the Court said\nno. That's different than saying whether the actual\ntime for commencing litigation is jurisdictional or not.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's\ncorrect. That's what Franconia ruled. However,\nFranconia reiterated the Irwin rule, which is that once\nsovereign immunity is waived the statute of limitations\napplies to the government.\nThe government in Franconia, as you say, was\npressing a very novel interpretation of the\nfirst-accrued language, and the Court said the\ngovernment doesn't get any advantage from that just\nbecause it's the government.\nSo just because the -- the government is the\ndefendant doesn't mean that it has that special\nadvantage once sovereign immunity is waived, as it has\nbeen here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if -- even if you're\nright, couldn't the Federal Circuit say: Well, that's\nall very interesting but Day v. McDonough told us that\nif we want to raise it on our own -- we don't have to if\nit's not jurisdictional; but if we want to, we can.\nMR. HAYNES: Justice Ginsburg, I think Day\nv. McDonough does not help the government here. Day v.\nMcDonough said that, yes, in the habeas situation the\ndistrict court might raise sua sponte the timeliness of\nthe claim. What the Court was -- the majority was clear\non this, and the three-member dissent was also crystal\nclear on this: That if the government waives the\nstatute of limitations, the Court would not have -- it\nwould be an abuse of discretion for the Court to\noverride that waiver.\nSo, Day v. McDonough actually helps our\nposition. Because not only was there a waiver here as\n-- but there was, for lack of a better word, a super\nwaiver, because the government, having raised the\nstatute of limitations in its pleadings, having moved to\ndismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations, then\nin special briefing asked by the trial judge here agreed\nthat the claim was filed timely and conceded that in the\nFederal Circuit. They not only waived it, they agreed\nthat the claim was filed timely.\nSo, Day v. McDonough, I think, helps our\nposition and not the government's position. And that\nwas made emphatically clear by at least eight members of\nthis Court in Day v. McDonough, the majority and the\nthree-member dissent.\nOne other point I'd like to make, and that\nis that if this Court holds that the statute of -- that\n2501 is jurisdictional, then the judges in the Court of\nFederal Claims for every case filed in front of them on\ntheir general jurisdiction docket have to -- will have\nto scrutinize the allegations in every complaint to\ndetermine if the complaint is -- has been timely filed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that assumes\nthat the government has waived in every case. If it\nhasn't waived, I have to do it anyway.\nMR. HAYNES: That's correct, Justice\nKennedy. However --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can usually count on\nthe government to file the canned sovereign immunity\nbrief.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAYNES: I think that's correct, Justice\nScalia. You can count on the government to file a\ncanned affirmative defense to the statute of\nlimitations, too.\nBut that's true, Justice Kennedy, if the\ngovernment has, has waived it then the court doesn't\nhave to, wouldn't have to do that. If they -- excuse\nme, if they raise it, the government doesn't have to --\nI'm sorry. If the government raises --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If they, if they raise the\ndefense --\nMR. HAYNES: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then you're going to\nhave to determine it anyway, subject to clearly\nerroneous findings of fact, as to when the person\nentered the property and so forth.\nMR. HAYNES: That's correct.\nBut even if, even if the government were to\nagree that the claim was timely filed, the judges would\nhave to consider it sua sponte in every case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's\nlike saying in every diversity case, theoretically, the\ncourt has to scrutinize whether someone who alleges they\nare a citizen of Pennsylvania really is. And that's\njust not the way it really happens. The question\nusually, if not raised by the party, comes up under some\nother situation, such as in this case the amicus raised\nit.\nMR. HAYNES: That's correct. But even if\nit's not raised, we think that if the statute is held\njurisdictional, then the courts have to address it sua\nsponte.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Haynes.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn a consistent line of decisions beginning\nin 1883, this Court has repeatedly construed the 6-year\nfiling requirement contained in Section 2501 and its\npredecessors as a nonwaivable jurisdictional limit on\nthe Court of Claim's authority to enter money judgments\nagainst the United States. Congress has recodified the\nstatute on various occasions and has modified its\nlanguage in minor respects. But it has made no change\nthat could call into question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I ask you\nthis question: Do you think the defense of the\nequitable tolling would be available under this statute?\nMR. STEWART: We don't, Your Honor. In\nfact, the Court has held both in Kendall and in Soriano\nthat equitable tolling is not available.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think Irwin even\nchanged the equitable tolling rule?\nMR. STEWART: We don't. Irwin read in the\nway we would read it, established that at least with\nrespect to statutes that provided for private suits\nagainst both governmental and private defendants, and\nperhaps with respect to suits against the government\ngenerally, that there is a presumption of equitable\ntolling. But the Court in Irwin recognized that that\npresumption could be rebutted. And in both Kendall and\nSoriano, the Court had relied on, inter alia, the fact\nthat the statute listed specific instances in which the\n6-year period could be tolled as evidence that there was\nno general authority to toll the statutory time limit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that when you're\nbeyond the seas or something?\nMR. STEWART: Beyond the seas or subject to\na legal disability. The original 1863 version of the\nstatute specified particular disabilities such as\ninfancy, et cetera.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you do with\nJustice Rehnquist's sentence: \"We think this case\naffords us an opportunity to adopt a more general rule\nto govern the applicability of equitable tolling suits\nagainst the government\"? Is there an implied exception\nfor Soriano there?\nMR. STEWART: I think there are two bases on\nwhich we would distinguish that language. The first is\nby its terms Chief Justice Rehnquist's sentence was\naddressed to equitable tolling, not to waivibility. And\nit's true that the Court in Bowles has linked the two,\nbut it doesn't appear that the Court in Irwin made that\nequation. That is, in the Irwin opinion the Court\nrecited the fact that both the district court and the\ncourt of appeals had ordered the case dismissed for lack\nof jurisdiction, because the filing requirement had not\nbeen met. And the Court said, we think that the statute\nis subject to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, I think I\nunderstand what you're saying, but I thought that the\ngovernment's distinction of Soriano was that was the\ngeneral rule for equitable tolling, so it doesn't apply\nhere, which I think is certainly understandable. But\nyou're saying it wasn't even a general rule for\nequitable tolling?\nMR. STEWART: It was at least a general rule\nfor equitable tolling with respect to statutes like\nTitle 7 that authorize suit against both the government\nand against private defendants. And there has been some\nback and forth in the Court since then as to whether the\nIrwin language extends more broadly. In Brockamp, the\nCourt suggested that some private analog is necessary\nbefore the Irwin presumption applies. In Scarborough\nversus Principi, the Court seemed to tilt in the\nopposite direction.\nBut part of our point is, even if the Irwin\npresumption of equitable tolling extends categorically\nto all suits against the government, equitable tolling\nis not the same thing as jurisdictionality or\nwaivibility. The Court in Bowles did link the two, but\nin Irwin itself the Court recited the fact that the\nlower courts had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\nAnd then when the Court concluded that Irwin\nhad not satisfied the prerequisites for equitable\ntolling, the Court simply said: Affirmed.\nNow, if the Court had intended in Irwin to\nestablish not simply that equitable tolling was\npotentially available, but that the time limit was not a\njurisdictional bar to begin with, it seems likely the\nCourt would at least have referred to the idea that the\ndismissal should have been for failure --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, I don't --\nit's -- we've found it difficult enough to figure out\nwhich statutes are jurisdictional and which are not.\nAnd now you want us to say, well, even if it's\njurisdictional, the consequences may be different for\njurisdiction and for equitable tolling and for\nwaivibility. I mean, it seems to me that's a very\ndifficult argument.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the Court has said both\nwith respect to Section 2501 and its predecessors and\nwith respect to statutory time limits for suing the\ngovernment generally, that the terms of Congress's\nconsent to suit define the jurisdiction of the reviewing\ncourt and a time limit for commencing suit is one of\nthose terms. And I would direct the Court's attention\nin particular to United States v. Dalm, which is cited\nin our brief on page 23. It was decided less than 9\nmonths before Irwin was decided. And the opinion in\nDalm is suffused with references to the jurisdictional\ncharacter of the time limit for commencing suit against\nthe government.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you certainly would\nbe mixing categories terribly if you suggested that\nsomething that goes to the court's authority to proceed\nin the case can be waived if it's equitable to waive it.\nI mean, those two notions are at odds with each other.\nMR. STEWART: Obviously, the government was\non the other side in Irwin, so in a sense I'm not the\nbest person to defend the Court's reasoning. But as\nbetween the reading of Irwin that would create this\nanomaly, that there could potentially be a\njurisdictional limit that was nevertheless subject to\nequitable tolling, and the argument on the other side\nthat Irwin sub silentio swept away numerous decisions of\nthis Court that had recited that the, that the terms of\nthe government's consent to suit are jurisdictional\nlimits and a time limit is one of those terms.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would, what\nwould Irwin and Franconia that made statements -- when\nit's a question of a time limit, they operate against\nthe government just like they operate against private\nparties, to what kind of case would that apply? I mean,\nit's been pointed out that 2501 covers a whole slew of\ncases, not just takings cases.\nMR. STEWART: Well, certainly the kind of\ncase that the Court was specifically dealing with in\nIrwin itself, and it's not an uncommon type of case now,\nis one in which Congress has passed a statute that\nimposes obligations on private parties and then imposes\nlike obligations on the government. And the gestalt of\nTitle 7, once it was amended to add the Federal\nGovernment as a potential defendant and to impose the\nsubstantive obligations on the government, was that the\ngovernment was to be dealt with with respect to matters\nof employment discrimination in the same way that a\nprivate employer would be in like circumstances, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose Franconia\nwould be a case where the Irwin logic not only would but\ndid apply.\nMR. STEWART: Well, in Franconia, the Court\nwas dealing with a different question. It was what do\nthe words \"first accrues\" mean? And it held that the --\nit essentially treated the phrase \"first accrues\" as a\nterm of art, as one that had appeared in prior statutes\ngoverning suits against other defendants. And so it saw\nno reason to believe that Congress intended those words\nto mean anything different in Section 2501 than they\nmeant in other statutes of limitations.\nAnd I guess the other point that I would\nmake both about Franconia and Irwin is, even if you read\nIrwin at its broadest, even if you construe it to mean\nthat there is a presumption that time limits for suing\nthe government are nonjurisdictional as well as subject\nto tolling, the Court in Irwin still made clear that the\npresumption could be rebutted. The presumption is not a\nlimit on Congress's authority. It's simply an aid to\nconstruction in situations where other tools of\ninterpretation don't produce a clear result. And here\nwe would say --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question,\nMr. Stewart. Supposing we didn't have any precedent at\nall, just the whole -- this is the first time this issue\nhad arisen, and we have the plain language of this\nstatute. Would you not read this statute, without any\nbackground, supporting your opponent?\nMR. STEWART: We wouldn't read it to -- if\nall we had was the text of the statute, we would not\nread it to permit waiver. And I should explain why.\nThe statute is reproduced in pertinent part at page 2 of\nthe government's brief. And the statute provides \"Every\nclaim of which the United States\" -- \"Every claim of\nwhich the United States Court of Federal Claims has\njurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon\nis filed within 6 years after such claim first accrues.\"\nAnd looking only at the text of the statute,\nthe language is categorical. It says every claim that\nis filed more than 6 years after accrual shall be\nbarred. The statute by its terms makes no exception for\ncases in which the government fails to raise --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Aren't statutes of\nlimitations generally more equivocal than that?\nMR. STEWART: No. I think often statutes of\nlimitations are written like that. But my point is in\nthe end Petitioner's argument really is not a plain\nlanguage argument. Petitioner's argument --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When you read the plain\nlanguage, you left out the words, \"of which the United\nStates Court of Claims has jurisdiction.\"\nMR. STEWART: I can understand that if you\nwere looking only at the language of the statute, you\nwould say -- you might say this is not a jurisdictional\nbar because it presumes jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: But with respect to the\nsubstantive question presented, namely whether the\nUnited States' failure to make the argument in a timely\nway causes it to be waived, the statute doesn't support\nPetitioner's position as to that. It is categorical.\nIt doesn't by its terms carve out an exception for cases\nin which the United States fails to raise a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about\nthe rules of the Court of Federal Claims? Rule 8(c)\nstates that the statute of limitations is an affirmative\ndefense. And that's in suits against the Government\nbecause that's all the Court of Federal Claims deals\nwith. So to what would that Rule 8(c) apply?\nMR. STEWART: Rule 8(c) says the following\naffirmative defenses shall be pled in the responsive\nproceeding, and it lists statute of limitations. I\nthink it could certainly -- it obviously couldn't\nsupersede the decisions of this Court or even of the\nFederal Circuit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But all those statutes of\nlimitations would be statutes of limitations operating\nagainst the government.\nMR. STEWART: I think the rule basically\ntracks, although not precisely tracks, the language of\nthe -- the parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, and\nwe would read it simply to mean to the extent this is an\naffirmative defense, it should be pleaded initially. It\ndoesn't say that the defense is waived if not pleaded.\nBut to return to the point that I was making\nearlier, in the end Petitioner's argument is not a plain\nlanguage argument. Petitioner's argument is that,\nnotwithstanding the absence on the face of the statute\nof an exception for cases in which the United States\nfails to plead the timeliness defense, this Court should\nread Section 2501 against the backdrop of a large body\nof law holding that statutes of limitations are\ngenerally waivable, and should assume that Congress\nintended to incorporate that understanding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't -- I don't\nthink it's quite -- putting the argument as I understand\nit, you would say let's look at Irwin, and we read it,\nso it's in your mind. Now think of that set of statute\nof limitations, the Federal ones, the Government ones,\nthat are either just as ambiguous as Irwin or even more\nambiguous. Think of that set.\nNow, in Irwin the Court says in the absence\nof special circumstances that whole set is going to be\ninterpreted as nonjurisdictional. That's what it says.\nSo you say, well, what Irwin didn't talk about is\nsuppose there's a member of that set where previously\nthe Court had held it was jurisdictional. It doesn't\ntell us what to do. Shall we read it as an exception or\nshall we not?\nAnd so what they are saying is, don't read\nit as an exception. There's no need to do so. Congress\nprobably never really thought about any of this stuff.\nRead it, Irwin, as including that one, too.\nSo what do you think of that point, whether\nit's theirs or not, leaving aside the argument about\nwhether this particular statute does or does not fall\nwithin that set? Assume it does.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think -- I think this\nessentially relates to the point that I was making that,\neven if there is a presumption of nonjurisdictionality\nannounced in Irwin, it's rebuttable and the presumption\nis simply an aid to construction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right, and then\nthe question is does the simple fact that we previously\nheld to the contrary count as a rebuttal? Does Irwin\nmean to -- see that's the same question I had before, so\nwhat do you think about that?\nMR. STEWART: In our view, yes, it does.\nThat is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. STEWART: It's a little artificial to\ntalk about what language Congress might or should have\nused in light of Irwin to make clear its intent that\nthis be treated as jurisdictional, when Congress in the\n1948 Judicial Code chose to recodify essentially the\nsame language that had previously been construed to\nimpose a jurisdictional limit. And the point I was\nmaking before about Petitioner's argument as to imputed\ncongressional intent -- in the end Petitioner's position\ndepends on the inference that because there was a body\nof law out there saying that statutes of limitations are\nordinarily waivable, Congress should be assumed to have\nintended to incorporate that body of law.\nAnd our point is if you're trying to impute\nCongress's intent it makes much more sense to assume\nthat Congress intended to recodify the same reading that\nthis Court had attached to this particular provision,\nnot that Congress intended to incorporate a meaning that\nthe Court had attached to other statutes of limitations\nthat the Court had specifically distinguished from this\none.\nAnd it's worth emphasizing that the\ndecisions in Kendall and Finn and De Arnaud can't be\naccused of the sort of loose or less than meticulous use\nof jurisdictional language that this Court has recently\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say that\nFranconia did use loose language, because although it\ndealt with accrual -- when does the claim accrue, and\nnot when is it cut off -- but it did say, it called 2501\nspecifically \"an unexceptional statute of limitations.\"\nMR. STEWART: It said that it was\nunexceptional and it said that many other statutes of\nlimitations used this language, namely the phrase \"first\naccrues.\" But one of the other points that the Court in\nFranconia attached significance to was the fact that the\nCourt of Claims had never given that phrase a broader\nreading in Section 2501. That is, the Court cited that\nas additional evidence that the phase had not been\nunderstood in this particular statute to bear a meaning\nother than it would have in other statutes of\nlimitations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if we looked at the\nCourt of Federal Claims decisions now, I think they're\nspelled out in the opinion. They go both directions.\nThat is, some say 2501 is jurisdictional, some say it's\nnot.\nMR. STEWART: I think the principal line of\nauthority in the Federal Circuit says it's\njurisdictional, but what can't be disputed is that this\nCourt has said over and over that it's jurisdictional,\nand the Court has again not used those -- that term in\npassing.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, because it said it in\na case -- the issue in the case was whether Franconia\nwas overruled -- I mean, Soriano was overruled. And\nJustice White thought it was. He said so in so many\nwords. And it's interesting that Justice Rehnquist in\nthe majority didn't disagree with that. Rather, he\ncited Justice White's dissent as part of his description\nof why some statutes are different from others, then\ncomes to the points that we want to adopt a general rule\nthat applies to all statutes. So it seems to me that\nthe implicit -- in his opinion he did not disagree with\nJustice White's characterization.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think it would be --\nagain, given the fact in particular that the Court in\nIrwin didn't speak explicitly to the question of\njurisdictionality one way or the other, I think it is\nnot uncommon for a -- a dissenting opinion to make\nassertions about the reach of a majority opinion, and\nthe majority opinion sometimes does and sometimes does\nnot respond to those.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the interesting part\nabout this is the discussion of the majority of this\ncase is part of its development of the fact that we've\ngot cases all over the lot and we want to adopt a clear\nrule to apply across the board. So it's part of the\nreasoning of the Court.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- but I think at most\nthe Court in Irwin was not trying to adopt a clear rule\nacross the board; it was trying to adopt a presumption,\nwhile recognizing that Congress could provide in\nindividual statutes for a rule different from the one\nthat the presumption would suggest. And again if --\nCongress had already been told that the language it was\nusing would be treated as jurisdictional -- and the\nCourt in the Kendall line of cases had not simply used\nthe label jurisdictional; it had said statutes of\nlimitations governing suits against private parties can\nbe waived if they're not asserted in a timely fashion,\nbut the time limit for filing suit against the United\nStates in the Court of Claims is different. This is a\nlimit on the Court's authority and the Court is required\nto notice it whether it's pleaded by the government or\nnot.\nSo I think Congress had been told that it\nwas already using language that would have the effect of\ncausing this to be jurisdictional and nonwaivable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Congress think that\nRule 8(c) has no range of application? And -- we have\ntwo recent statements saying statutes of limitations\nagainst the government are like statutes against private\nparties. But if 2501, which covers all of the cases\nover which the Court of Federal Claims has\njurisdiction -- if, if it's for jurisdictional, then I\ndon't know what cases there would be in which there's a\ntime limit in a suit against the government that isn't\njurisdictional.\nMR. STEWART: I mean -- I think -- I think\nyou may well be correct, that is perhaps to the extent\nthe drafters of the rule were doing something other than\nsimply incorporating the existing language of the\ncomparable Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. If all they\nwere saying was if there's a statute of limitations out\nthere that would function as an affirmative defense in\nour cases, in our court, we want it to be pleaded\nimmediately as it would be in a private civil action.\nIf that's what they're saying, you may well\nbe right that the class of cases to which that would\npertain is the null set or something very close to it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't Mr. Haynes have a\npoint when he suggested at the end of his argument that\nquestions about accrual involve much more complicated\nfactual questions than are usually involved in deciding\nwhether a court has jurisdiction? So imagine if this\ncase came up today and the government adhered to its\nprior position -- I don't know whether it's still it's\nposition -- that there had not been a permanent taking\nuntil 1998, would the court -- and none of the events\nthat happened before 1998 had been brought to the\ncourt's attention -- would the court have to say to the\nparties: Well, this is fine; we see that there was a\nfence put up in 1998, but now you have to tell us\neverything else that's happened on this site going back\n10 years to see whether there -- whether the claim might\nhave accrued at some earlier point.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I guess we'd have two or\nthree responses to that. The first is, at least before\njudgment could be entered in favor of the plaintiff, the\ncourt would ultimately have to determine not only that\nthere was -- had been a taking, but would have to\ndetermine the date on which the taking occurred in order\nto award compensation, if nothing else. So this seems\nlike the kind of question that would ultimately have to\nbe determined, at least before the plaintiff could be\nsuccessful.\nThe second thing, as was pointed out before,\nat least in the majority of cases where there is a\nviable limitations argument, the government is going to\nplead it, and so asking the court to look beyond this --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if you didn't think\nit was -- it was a good argument. Would you have an\nobligation to say, we think there was a permanent fence\nput up in 1998 and we agree that there was a taking as\nof that point, but we don't think it happened earlier,\nbut you need to know all of these additional facts?\nWould you have an obligation to present that to the\ncourt?\nMR. STEWART: It would depend upon the\ncourt's rules. That is, if the court required a\nseparate statement as to jurisdiction then probably the\nadvocate would include at least a thumbnail sketch of\nthe relevant facts. If it was -- if the rules of the\ncourt were such that the advocate didn't have to address\njurisdiction unless he or she was actively contesting\nit, then no.\nBut the -- I guess the more fundamental\npoint we would make is the speculation as to disruptive\nresults would carry a lot more force if the government\nwere asking for a rule that was different from what had\nbeen done in the past. That is, even Petitioner would\nconcede that, for the great bulk of the country's\nhistory, this rule was treated as jurisdictional, and\nPetitioner's argument is simply that that line of\nauthority was effectively overruled in Irwin in 1990.\nAnd so if in fact treating this limit as a\njurisdictional limit would have the effect of disrupting\nlitigation in the CFC, we would expect the Petitioner to\nhave actual evidence to that effect. If we were asking\nfor a different rule than had been enforced in the past,\nthen there would be more --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know the CFC is\nat least confused because they have some cases going one\nway and some cases going the other way. And from the\ngovernment's point of view, the government can be relied\non to raise the statute of limitations, I suppose, but\naren't there cases where the government would really\nlike to get the substantive issue settled? So it says,\nwell, the statute of limitations is arguable, but we'll\nconcede that the action was timely.\nMR. STEWART: I think that's true even as to\ncases involving barriers that everyone would concede are\njurisdictional. For instance, there are cases in which\na litigant sues us, and there is great doubt as to his\nstanding to sue, and it may be an issue that we think is\notherwise framed in an appropriate context, and the\ngovernment might feel that it would be to everyone's\nbenefit to get the issue resolved when -- one way or the\nother. But one consequence of treating that as a\njurisdictional barrier is simply that the government\ncan't always have its way.\nSo I don't think -- I would think that you\nare correct that there might be some instances in which\ntreatment of this limit as a jurisdictional bar would\nnot be in the government's interest. But that's not a\nbasis for holding it to be nonjurisdictional.\nCertainly the majority of cases involving\nboth -- I think, involving both 2501 and other\nprovisions that impose time limits for suits against the\ngovernment, in which the courts have held that the\nrelevant limit is jurisdictional, typically the\nsituation arises where the government decides to make an\nargument on appeal that it didn't make in the district\ncourt. I think a case like this one, where the\ngovernment doesn't argue the point even on appeal and\nthe court of appeals nevertheless holds that the suit\nwas untimely, those are the rarity. But we certainly\nagree that the logical implication of treating the time\nlimit as jurisdictional is that the Federal circuit did\nthe right thing here.\nI'd like to say a couple of words about\nBowles. I think Bowles doesn't compel a ruling in the\ngovernment's favor, but it does support our position in\nvarious respects. First, as the Chief Justice alluded\nto earlier, Bowles emphasized that time limits for\nfiling notices of appeal had historically been treated\nas jurisdictional limits, and the Court said that, given\nthe choice between calling into question some dicta in\nour recent opinions and effectively overruling a century\nworth of practice, we think the former option is the\nonly prudent course.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, of course, Bowles --\nI mean the Court did miss something. Everyone on the\nCourt did, and that is that the period to file your\nnotice of appeal was originally not in any statute. It\nwas in the rule, the FRAP rule. The opinions, both\nsides, assumed that the statute came first, and the rule\nwas adopted to conform to the statute, but in fact it\nwas just the opposite. It was a rule, a Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure, which can't affect jurisdiction. We\nknow that. As Congress says rules of procedure don't\naffect jurisdiction. So there was the rule, and then\nthe U.S. Judicial Conference said to Congress, when it\nreferred the rule to Congress, you might consider a\nconforming amendment. And then the statute, after the\nrule came into effect, conformed to the rule. So what\nthe Court, both sides, thought in Bowles -- we just had\nit in reverse.\nMR. STEWART: I agree that the Court's\nopinions didn't note that fact, but I don't think that\nfact would or should have affected the treatment of the\nstatute as jurisdictional. That is, once it was brought\nto Congress's attention that there was a potential\nconflict or tension between the language of the\njurisdictional statute and the language of the\ncorresponding Federal rule, Congress had the choice to\nmake as to which should govern, and if Congress had\nwanted a different result from the one that was in the\nFederal rule, it could have enacted different language.\nI think it would not -- whatever we might privately\nthink is the level of attention that Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Congress didn't\nthink about it at all until the U.S. Judicial Conference\nsaid do this --\nMR. STEWART: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the U.S. Judicial\nConference wasn't thinking that thereby it became\njurisdictional.\nMR. STEWART: But my point is that, once\nthis was brought to Congress's attention, Congress could\nhave chosen to stick with other language, in which case\nI have no doubt that the corresponding rule would have\nbeen amended to fit the statute. Again, whatever\nlevel of attention we might privately think that\nCongress devoted to this question, the fact is that\nCongress acted as a body, passed a law, it was signed --\npassed statutes in both houses. It was signed into law\nby the President. And from that point forward, it was a\nstatutory rule and had to be treated as such. So I\nagree that this aspect of the problem wasn't addressed\nspecifically by the opinions in Bowles, but I don't see\nany basis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was addressed\nspecifically. It was addressed that the rule -- that\nthe -- that all of this was statute driven. But the\nrule before -- before there was a conforming statute,\nyou would say, well, then it wasn't jurisdictional,\nright?\nMR. STEWART: I think to treat it as a\nconforming statute suggests that, in some way, Congress\nwas obligated to do what the advisors told it to do or\nwas obligated to conform Section 2107(a) to the terms of\nthe Federal rule, and that's not the case. Congress\ncould have -- once this matter was brought to its\nattention, Congress could have enacted whatever statute\nit wanted. It chose to enact a statute that tracked the\npreexisting language of the rule, but from that time\nforward, the notice of appeal deadline was grounded in\nstatute, and it was a statutory limit that applied to\nBowles's own notice of appeal. So I don't think there\nis a basis for saying the case would or should have come\nout differently if the Court had been aware of the\nhistory of the statute's development.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I go back to the\nanswer you gave Justice Stevens when he asked you to\nassume that there was no precedent, we're reading this\nas an original matter. I thought your answer to him,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, was that, well, in any event\n\"shall be barred\" means that it can't be waived anyway.\nBut statute -- I looked up other statutes of\nlimitations, and other statutes of limitations: \"Shall\nnot be entertained,\" \"may not be commenced,\" \"may not be\nbrought.\"\nMR. STEWART: My point is, if we were\nreading the statute without reference to any precedent\naddressing either 2501 itself or statutes of limitations\ngenerally, kind of the pure myopic, literal reading of\nthe statute, without reference to the legal context,\nwould suggest that \"every\" means every, \"shall be\nbarred\" means shall be barred, and there is no exception\nfor cases in which the government fails to raise the\nargument in a timely way. And my point is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My response was all\nstatute of limitations say that and all statute of\nlimitations can be waived.\nMR. STEWART: And my point is there is no\nbasis for Petitioner's argument that in inferring\nCongress's intent the Court should look to part of the\nbroader legal context, namely: Decisions of this Court\nand others that have dealt with the general treatment of\nstatutes of limitations, but should ignore the other\npart of the legal context, namely: Decisions of this\nCourt that have said, squarely and unequivocally, this\nparticular time limit is different.\nThis particular time limit is nonwaivable\nand jurisdictional even though most statutes of\nlimitations can be waived if they are not asserted in a\ntimely way.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One last question: We\ndisagreed on parts of the Irwin opinion, but I take it\nyou would agree with me that the government was\nparticularly well represented in that case, wouldn't\nyou?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: The government could not have\nbeen better represented, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is hard to\nunderstand how they could have lost the case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: I had the same reaction\nreading the transcript.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stewart.\nMr. Haynes, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAYNES: With respect, I suggest that\nthe government won the battle, but lost the war on\nIrwin.\nThis Court over the last few decades has\nattempted to bring some coherence to both the questions\nof sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction.\nAnd I think that the way the Court has\nframed the issues in Irwin to say that there is a\npresumption that statutes of limitation are tollable\nand, therefore, are not jurisdictional in our view,\ntends to show that the Court wants a clear statement\nfrom Congress.\nThe presumption language says Congress may\nat any time say otherwise and make a statute of\nlimitations jurisdictional. Unless it does so, the\nstatute of limitations would not affect subject matter\njurisdiction.\nMy brother makes the argument that Brockamp\nrebutted the Irwin presumption, but it's very important\nto understand that the Brockamp decision did not speak\nin jurisdictional terms. It spoke in a -- a mere matter\nof statutory -- not \"a mere matter\" -- it spoke in terms\nof statutory interpretation. It did not speak in\njurisdictional terms.\nSo Erwin, standing unassailed since that\ntime, has forced the courts to look at the plain\nlanguage of the statute, which is precisely what we\nadvocate this Court does. Unless the Court has further\nquestions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
