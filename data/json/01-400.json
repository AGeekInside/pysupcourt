        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 01-400, Ricky Bell v. Gary Bradford Cone.\nMr. -- Mr. Moore.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MOORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe court of appeals was without authority to\ngrant habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1) on\nrespondent's ineffective assistance of counsel claim for\ntwo reasons: first, because the State court decision\nrejecting the claim correctly identified this Court's\ndecision in Strickland v. Washington as the clearly\nestablished Federal law governing this case, not United\nStates v. Cronic as respondent contends; and second,\nbecause the State court's application of Strickland to the\nfacts of respondent's case was not objectively\nunreasonable.\nTurning to the first point, respondent's\nineffective assistance claim from the outset of this case\nhas asserted two specific errors that his attorney\nallegedly committed during the sentencing phase of his\ncapital trial: first, counsel's alleged failure to\npresent available mitigating evidence; and second, his\ncounsel's decision to waive closing argument.\nThis Court held in Strickland that such claims\nare properly analyzed under the two-part actual deficient\nperformance/actual prejudice test announced in that case\nitself.\nQUESTION: Mr. Moore, I think what happened in\nthis sentencing proceeding, if I remember correctly, is\nthat the attorney made some remarks at the beginning of\nthe sentencing hearing?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor. He delivered an\nopening statement, during which he specifically called the\njury's attention, as he is permitted to do under Tennessee\nState law, to guilt phase evidence, mental health\nevidence, upon which he was relying in mitigation. He\nexplained to the jury its mitigating significance by\nrelating that evidence specifically to three statutory\nmitigating factors.\nIn addition, during that opening statement, he\nemphasized his client's remorse for his role in the\ncrimes. He emphasized his client's honorable service for\nhis country.\nQUESTION: Did he explain that he wouldn't be\npresenting any evidence or saying anything more?\nMR. MOORE: He -- he did not indicate one way or\nthe other in that statement, but he specifically --\nQUESTION: Now, would you be here -- would you\nstill be here if he had not said anything at the opening?\nThen what rule applies? Suppose the defense attorney just\ntotally remained silent in the sentencing phase. Would\nCronic be the test?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. MOORE: It is our -- it is our position that\nif the claim focuses on counsel's conduct during the trial\nand it is not alleged that any errors or omissions he made\nwere the result of State interference or so-called\nsurrounding circumstances, then such a claim is properly\nanalyzed under Strickland's two-part test.\nQUESTION: The attorney here did successfully\nobject to the presentation of some evidence during the\nsentencing phase, didn't he?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, indeed, Your Honor, he did. He\nvigorously objected and -- to the admission of some very\ngruesome crime scene photographs that the prosecution\nsought to introduce to establish the heinous, atrocious,\nand cruel aggravating circumstance, and he succeeded in\nexcluding that testimony. In addition, he -- he objected\nto some hearsay evidence. And so, the -- the Sixth\nCircuit's suggestion that counsel simply sat mute at the\nsentencing hearing simply is belied by this record.\nQUESTION: Just to go back to Justice O'Connor's\nquestion, suppose the attorney says nothing and later\nsays, you know, I was just -- I don't know -- stressed\nout, traumatized. I -- I really blanked out during that\nproceeding. No Cronic there?\nAnd -- and do you say Cronic doesn't apply\nbecause he did participate in the earlier phase of the\ncase and you don't want us to bifurcate guilt phase and\nsentencing? Was -- was that the basis of your answer?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's a two-part question.\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor. Our position is\nthat if the ineffective assistance claim asserts that the\nlawyer, for whatever reason, failed to do something or did\nsomething in error, that -- those kinds of claims are\nproperly analyzed under Strickland, and we think that's a\nfair reading of Strickland. Strickland itself says\nconflict of interest claims aside, actual ineffectiveness\nclaims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are\nsubject to the general requirement that the defendant\naffirmatively prove prejudice.\nQUESTION: When does Cronic apply?\nMR. MOORE: Cronic in our view is properly read\nto apply only when surrounding circumstances or State\ninterference renders it unlikely that any lawyer could\nhave rendered effective assistance of counsel. Of course,\nCronic itself --\nQUESTION: Well, in my -- in my hypothetical, he\nsaid I just blanked out for a minute.\nMR. MOORE: But that circumstance is the\nlawyer's own problem. For our -- for analytical purposes\nin our view, it shouldn't matter whether counsel's\nfailure, for example, to make a critical objection or to\ndo something he should have done was the result of his\nbeing asleep or his working a crossword puzzle or his\nignorance of the law. What ought to matter is whether his\nconduct, what he did or failed to do, violated prevailing\nprofessional norms. If -- if it did, that's deficient\nperformance, and then the Court under Strickland examines\nthe record to ascertain whether that error --\nQUESTION: Do we take it as a given in this case\nthat the attorney did provide -- that there was\nineffective assistance at sentencing? Do we take that as\na -- a given?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor. No, Your Honor.\nOur petition challenges the correctness of the court of --\nof appeals decision under section 2254(d)(1), and that\ninvolves our argument that the State court's application\nof Strickland to the facts of this case was not\nunreasonable.\nThe actual ineffectiveness claims Mr. Hutton's\nclient raises are twofold. He complains that available\nmitigating evidence was not presented, but the record\nsimply does not support that claim. Counsel was under no\nobligation to reintroduce the mental health evidence that\nhad been introduced during the guilt phase because\nTennessee State law specifically allows counsel to rely on\nguilt phase evidence. As I earlier indicated, counsel\nspecifically explained the mitigating significance of that\nevidence to the jury during his opening statement and\nrelated it to three specific statutory mitigating\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: This is not the first time in one of\nthese cases I've been surprised at how skimpy the\npresentation is at -- by the defense counsel on\nsentencing. Maybe there's some dynamic in the courtroom:\nthe jury knows how important it is; he doesn't want to\ndestroy a -- a certain intensity that they're bringing to\ntheir case. But on the cold record, it certainly seems\nskimpy.\nMR. MOORE: Well --\nQUESTION: I'm tempted to ask you if this is\nusual, but that -- that's probably not a fair question as\nthere are so many differences in so many cases.\nMR. MOORE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nRespondent's complaint that counsel --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Moore, may I ask you? On\nthat -- on that branch of it, it seems to me that there\nwas, the prosecutor's presentation to the jury was about a\nmatch for the defense attorney's. Neither one -- both of\nthem were skimpy.\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor. And that is --\nthat point is critical to our assertion that counsel's\ndecision to waive closing argument was not deficient\nperformance.\nQUESTION: But I had another question that I\nwanted to ask you, and that was you presented two\nquestions. One is that the Sixth Circuit never should\nhave reached the merits, and two, on the merits they were\nwrong.\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: As a matter -- and the Sixth Circuit\nproceeded just the other way. It decided the merits first\nand then it -- it said it was clearly established. Are\nyou asking this Court or don't you care what -- what order\nwe take these up in, or do you have a preference?\nMR. MOORE: Well, it's our -- it's our position,\nYour Honor, that it is not the function of this Court\nunder 2254(d) to reach -- to actually address the merits\nas if it were deciding this claim de novo. The only\nquestion to be resolved here is whether the State court's\nrejection of the claim was either contrary to or involved\nan unreasonable application of clearly established law.\nWe would suggest that the Williams v. Taylor\nopinion provides the blueprint for the decision here. The\nfirst question is did the State court correctly identify\nthe governing legal principle.\nQUESTION: Don't you think it would be a little\ncoy for us to decide, well, it wasn't an unreasonable\napplication of -- of Federal law when we, in fact, know\nthat -- or believe that it was a correct application of\nFederal law? Do you insist that we simply say -- and go\nno further than to say, oh, it was -- it was not an\nunreasonable application?\nMR. MOORE: I certainly would not begrudge the\nCourt's agreeing that the State court had indeed correctly\napplied Strickland. But it -- it is my assertion that\nunder 2254 the language of the statute contemplates that\nthe Federal court -- court approach the case by looking at\nthe bottom line decision of the State court and\nascertaining whether it is reasonable.\nQUESTION: Indeed, if we could go no further\nthan -- than the coy statement that it was not an\nunreasonable application, I suppose you shouldn't have had\ntwo questions. You should have just had one.\nMR. MOORE: That's correct, Your Honor. I think\nthat's right.\nOn the decision to waive closing argument --\nQUESTION: Mr. Moore, let -- let me interrupt\nyou. How -- how -- does the record show how long the\npenalty phase of the trial took?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor. The record\nreflects that opening statements started at approximately\n12:07 p.m. and that the jury retired to deliberate at\nabout 3:05 p.m., and there was about an hour-and-ten-\nminute break for lunch in there. And they announced their\nverdict somewhere along about a quarter of four.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. MOORE: And so, indeed, counsel could have\nreasonably believed that all of the points he had made\nduring his opening statement, his plea for mercy, his\nemphasis on his client's remorse, and the mitigating\nsignificance of the guilt phase evidence, were fresh in\nthe jury's mind when the jury retired to deliberate\nbecause that --\nQUESTION: What did he -- what did he say about\nthe Bronze Star?\nMR. MOORE: During his opening statement, he did\nnot specifically mention the Bronze Star because that\nevidence was not elicited until his cross-examination of\none of the witnesses during the sentencing phase. He did,\nhowever, emphasize during his opening statement his\nclient's service in Vietnam and the toll that service had\ntaken on his client and his mental health status.\nQUESTION: So, your answer is he didn't mention\nit in his argument.\nMR. MOORE: He did not mention the Bronze Star.\nNow, counsel's complaint that the Bronze Star\nhad some mitigating significance beyond the fact of its\naward is simply not supported by the record. No evidence\nwas presented to the State post-conviction court that the\nBronze Star, other than the fact of its award and the fact\nthat of -- that it indicated Mr. Cone had been decorated\n-- no evidence elaborating on that was ever presented to\nthe State courts.\nSimilarly, no evidence concerning Mr. Cone's\nfamily background, social history, military record,\neducational record, none of the evidence that Mr. Hutton\ncomplains was not presented during the sentencing phase\nwas ever presented to the State courts during the post-\nconviction hearing.\nAccordingly, under this Court's decision in\nBurger v. Kemp, we say that the State courts reasonably\nconcluded that there was no deficient performance in -- in\nthat regard in this case because no record was ever made\nin the State court concerning what the allegedly available\nmitigating evidence might have been. No testimony was\nintroduced indicating what these witnesses who allegedly\nhad knowledge concerning these matters would have said had\nthey been called at the sentencing.\nQUESTION: But am I right that such evidence was\nintroduced in the Federal court?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor. This case was\nresolved on summary judgment, and so none of -- none of\nthat evidence --\nQUESTION: Were allegations that such evidence\nwas available made in the Federal proceeding?\nMR. MOORE: The allegation that it was available\nwas made in the Federal proceeding, but there was no\nevidentiary --\nQUESTION: And was that allegation denied?\nMR. MOORE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MOORE: Well, I don't know that it was\ndenied. Our -- our point in the Federal court was that no\nmitigating evidence was presented to the State court, and\nso therefore --\nQUESTION: But if we're not deciding the case on\nthe basis of what that evidence would prove or disprove,\nbut rather on whether counsel was deficient in failing to\nintroduce it, should we not assume the evidence exists?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: We should not?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor. If -- if --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. MOORE: Because the burden rests with the\npetitioner, the habeas petitioner, to demonstrate its\nexistence. If -- if the State court -- if it was never\npresented to the State court, there is no basis for\nassuming it exists.\nQUESTION: What -- what was the -- what was the\ncase you just cited to us for that proposition?\nMR. MOORE: Burger v. Kemp. In that case, Your\nHonor, just as here, the complaint was that counsel was\ndeficient for failing to put on any mitigating evidence,\nand in a couple of particulars, this Court noted that\ncounsel had failed to make a record in the State courts\nconcerning whether the -- the allegedly omitted evidence\nwould have had any substantial mitigating impact. And in\nthat circumstance, this Court said that it could not find\ndeficient performance, let alone prejudice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Moore, are you done with that\npoint?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: It isn't stated in your brief, but I\nassume that it's -- it's the Tennessee rule that if -- if\nthe defense doesn't make a closing -- a closing statement,\nthe prosecution doesn't either. Is that it?\nMR. MOORE: That's right, and that was the --\nthe State court found, based on the evidence --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MOORE: -- presented to it during the post-\nconviction hearing that counsel made a tactical decision\nto waive in -- in order to prevent the senior prosecutor\nfrom delivering what he --\nQUESTION: The fearsome Mr. Strother. Could --\ncould we get him to argue a case up here?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MOORE: I am not -- I am not acquainted with\nGeneral Strother, so I'm not sure, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But I gather that this isn't the only\noccasion on which defense counsel have eschewed the making\nof closing argument for fear that Mr. Strother would be\nenabled to unleash his -- his weaponry.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MOORE: That's correct, Your Honor. In\nfact, one of respondent's own experts at the State post-\nconviction hearing stated that he had waived closing\nargument as a defense counsel for precisely the same\nreason, to -- to prevent Mr. Strother from delivering what\nwas typically a killing rebuttal argument. And he\npronounced that this was a -- clearly a viable trial\ntactic.\nIn -- in addition, both he and another expert\nwere asked point blank whether waiver of closing in -- in\nthese circumstances with these advocates amounted to\nessentially a -- a breach of prevailing professional\nnorms. And both refused to say whether it would or\nwouldn't.\nIndeed, we think that that testimony is\nabsolutely critical, because surely if the only witnesses\nwho are actually qualified as experts and competent to\ntestify whether a particular decision of counsel breached\nprevailing -- prevailing professional norms are unwilling\nto state that they -- that there has been a breach, surely\na State court does not act unreasonably in concluding that\nthe defendant has failed to overcome Strickland's strong\npresumption that all significant decisions of counsel are\nmade in -- in the exercise of reasonable professional\njudgment.\nQUESTION: Can we go back to the Bronze Star?\nIt certainly did come out in the sentencing phase. How\ndid it?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor. During the\ntestimony of the criminal court clerk, who had been called\nby the State merely to establish the prior violent\nfelonies, respondent's three convictions for armed robbery\nin Oklahoma, during that -- during Mr. Dice's cross\nexamination, defense counsel's cross examination, of the\ncriminal court clerk, he had the criminal court clerk read\nfrom, I believe it was, Mr. Cone's sentencing records or\nprison records from -- prison classification records from\nOklahoma, the fact that Mr. Cone had been awarded a Bronze\nStar in Vietnam. That's how that evidence came into\nbeing. Indeed, it was the result of cross examination by\ndefense counsel during the sentencing phase of this trial.\nQUESTION: Do we have any evidence to indicate\nwhether Mr. Dice would have put on evidence showing the\nBronze Star if he had not been able to bring it out in\ncross examination?\nMR. MOORE: The record simply doesn't reflect\nwhether or not that would have been the case. Mr. Dice\ntestified that he viewed that as an opening that he had\nand that he -- he was actually quite pleased with himself,\nif Your Honor will read his testimony about his ability to\nget that accomplished without presenting direct evidence\non it.\nQUESTION: Do you think he was entitled to be\npleased with himself for the way he got that in the\nrecord?\nMR. MOORE: Your Honor, I --\nQUESTION: Is that the way you would have done\nit if you had been the lawyer?\nMR. MOORE: I'm not certain that -- that hearsay\nevidence in a prison record is the best evidence of that\nfact. We don't really know anything about the Bronze Star\nother than it is mentioned in this prison record. We\ndon't know if there is a --\nQUESTION: And that's all the jury found out\nabout it, too.\nMR. MOORE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And we know nothing more about it\nnow? Nothing came out in the Tennessee proceedings --\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor, and -- and --\nQUESTION: -- about the circumstances?\nMR. MOORE: -- respondent introduced no evidence\nbefore the State courts concerning why the -- the Bronze\nStar was awarded, anything about the circumstances of its\naward.\nQUESTION: Was it -- were there any problems in\nhis service record? He served in Germany and Vietnam.\nMR. MOORE: Not insofar as this record reflects,\nYour Honor, no.\nQUESTION: And did the lawyer put in any\nevidence about his -- what kind of a person he was before\nhe went to Vietnam?\nMR. MOORE: During sentencing? No. There was\nno evidence concerning his background or character at all,\nbut we don't know what such evidence would have been,\nbecause none was presented to the State court during the\npost-conviction proceeding.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Moore.\nMR. MOORE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe United States has addressed the second\nquestion presented, which is whether a defendant must show\nprejudice to establish a claim of ineffective assistance.\nStrickland holds that to establish such a claim,\ncounsel's performance must be both deficient and\nprejudicial. Respondent's claims fall within Strickland\nbecause he alleges that counsel was deficient in failing\nto present mitigating evidence --\nQUESTION: Well, do you want us to assume then\nthat the performance was deficient and then address the\nprejudice prong?\nMS. BLATT: No. I think the -- when the Court\naddresses the section 2254, the threshold question, if the\nCourt uses Williams v. Taylor as a road map, is whether\nStrickland is the clearly established law. And it is the\nclearly established law because this claim is an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nNow, if the Court determines that Strickland is\nthe correct decision and that the State court correctly\nidentified that decision, then the remaining question is\nwhether the State courts unreasonably applied Strickland\non the facts of this case.\nQUESTION: So, you don't get to question 2 at\nall, then.\nMS. BLATT: You get to -- you can -- you get to\nquestion 2 if, in determining that Strickland and not\nCronic is the clearly established law, this Court holds\nthat Cronic does not apply when the claim is an actual\nineffective assistance claim. And that is because\nStrickland squarely governs claims alleging deficiencies\nin attorney performance and that's -- that's what this\ncase is.\nCronic did make an observation that prejudice\nmay be presumed when counsel entirely fails to subject the\nprosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing. But\nthat's not this case. Counsel put on a meaningful case\nfor life and he did it in his opening statement. He had\nalready introduced the substantial mitigation evidence\nduring the sentencing proceeding and the State court\nprocedures expressly allowed the jury to consider that\nevidence in its sentencing deliberations in determining\nwhether to impose the death sentence.\nNow, to take a claim of ineffective assistance\nand just to presume prejudice under Cronic would be\ninconsistent with what the Court said in Strickland, and\nthat is, absent a showing of prejudice, it cannot be said\nthat a verdict of a death sentence resulted from an\nadversarial breakdown that renders the death sentence\nunreliable.\nThe Court also said --\nQUESTION: What -- what if the defense counsel\npresented nothing at all at the sentencing phase, do you\nthink that there is potential for application of Cronic in\nthose circumstances?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, Justice O'Connor. We think\nCronic is --\nQUESTION: So, you differ from Mr. Moore in that\nregard.\nMS. BLATT: We do but our difference is very\nnarrow. We think Cronic refers to an extreme situation\nwhere counsel provides absolutely no assistance at trial\nand, in effect, the defendant has been denied the\nassistance of counsel under Gideon v. Wainwright because\nessentially the defendant lacked counsel. And that's a\nvery rare situation and exceedingly narrow.\nQUESTION: Why divide trial into, you know, the\none phase and then the -- the mitigation phase? It's all\npart of the same trial. Couldn't you likewise divide it\ninto the -- the direct examination phase and the cross\nexamination phase and say that he totally failed to do his\njob in the cross examination phase? I mean, you -- you\nknow, you can cut up a -- a trial into as many little\npieces as you want --\nMS. BLATT: Right, and --\nQUESTION: -- and say counsel utterly failed to\n-- to litigate this particular piece.\nMS. BLATT: We couldn't agree with you more. To\ndo that would just swallow the rule in Strickland and\nwould be inconsistent with the idea that counsel could\nreasonably omit to cross examine a witness or fail to\nproduce evidence.\nQUESTION: What justification do you have for --\nfor separating out the mitigation phase from the other,\nespecially when some of the evidence that went to\nmitigation was presented during -- during the direct\nphase?\nMS. BLATT: Right. And -- and the prosecution\nmay have a reasonable argument in many cases that counsel\ndid not entirely fail to provide assistance. We just\ndon't take issue with the idea that when Cronic spoke of a\nsituation of counsel entirely failing to -- to provide\nassistance, that the presumption of prejudice would be\nassumed. But I think in -- in many cases, we're talking\nabout the entire trial.\nQUESTION: But you're giving up the principle.\nOnce you -- once you allow that you can split it into the\n-- into the guilt phase and the mitigation phase, it can\nbe split other ways as well, I assume.\nMS. BLATT: We don't think so, and --\nQUESTION: I mean, why wouldn't it just be\nhere's a counsel who litigated the case properly but he\nmade -- he made a mistake in -- in his litigation? He\ndidn't put on any evidence in the -- in the mitigation\nphase. You don't want to do it that way. You want to\nsay, no, we can look at -- look at this trial as really\ntwo separate trials, and because he did nothing in the --\nin the mitigation phase, it is not a situation of -- of\ninadequate counsel, it's a -- it's a situation of no\ncounsel. I -- once you've given up that principle, I\ndon't know why we don't split it up other ways as well.\nMS. BLATT: We don't think so. In this case, it\nwould -- it -- it reasonably could fall on the Strickland\nside if there's a State procedure that allows a jury to\nconsider mitigation evidence, but if there is an entire\nfailure to do anything throughout the entire trial, it is\nexceedingly unlikely that that could be the result of\nany --\nQUESTION: Well, when -- when you say the entire\ntrial, are you talking about the penalty phase or the\nwhole -- the whole trial?\nMS. BLATT: We would be talking about a penalty\nphase although I agree with Justice Scalia that in the\nunique situation of this case, where there's an express\nprocedure that allows the jury to consider the mitigation\nevidence, it's critical to look at counsel's performance\nduring the -- the guilt phase of the trial.\nBut this is not a -- a case where we think\nthere's reasonable dispute about whether this falls under\nCronic or Strickland. Counsel --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Is -- is that unique? I\nmean, if -- if -- is it unique that -- you mean in -- in\nother States, the jury in the mitigation phase is not\nallowed to consider evidence that -- that came in during\nthe penalty phase?\nMS. BLATT: I don't think that is unique and I'm\nsorry if I misspoke.\nQUESTION: I don't think it is.\nMS. BLATT: I think it's --\nQUESTION: Which means the two phases are\nlinked. If -- if it were unique, you -- you might have\nsome basis for saying the mitigation phase is so separate\nthat if he doesn't introduce evidence there, he is absent.\nIt's like not having counsel. But that's not my\nunderstanding of what happens in most States. It's one\ntrial.\nMS. BLATT: Right, and if you -- if we're just\ntalking -- if you take it out of the capital proceeding so\nyou don't have the split trial, all we're saying is if\nthere's an entire failure, we would think that it would be\nappropriate to presume prejudice. But we won't -- there's\njust not that many cases because counsel usually is\nproviding some assistance, and the claim is that the\nassistance that was provided was ineffective for a number\nof reasons. And that is this case. The --\nQUESTION: Why isn't the line -- is it -- you\nknow, that you can draw a line one place doesn't mean it's\nsensible to draw it every place. And they are discrete\nphases, the trial -- and it's not a mitigation stage.\nIt's a sentencing, where aggravating factors come in as\nwell. Is that not so?\nMS. BLATT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So, if one can say, yes, I see these\nare two parts, it doesn't follow from that that I have to\nthen separate every examination and every cross\nexamination. It's a question of where you draw the line.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think that's correct, and\nhowever you draw the line, this case falls on the\nStrickland side of the line because this is not a case\nwhere counsel didn't do anything. This is a case where it\nis just alleged that what -- the two strategic judgments\nthat counsel made were unreasonable.\nQUESTION: May I ask? Supposing you had a case\n-- and I know this is not quite it -- in which there is\nstrong evidence that counsel was mentally disabled and\nthat that made him less effective throughout the entire\nsentencing hearing. Would you judge that kind of a case\nunder Cronic or Strickland?\nMS. BLATT: It would be under Strickland.\nUsually counsel's --\nQUESTION: Even if there was severe mental\nillness on the part of counsel?.\nMS. BLATT: Is counsel's -- things that would go\nto impair counsel judgments are generally irrelevant\nunless they manifest themselves -- manifest themselves in\nobjectively unreasonable conduct. And so if -- if counsel\nis performing objectively reasonable, that counsel is no\ndifferent than someone who makes a mistake because --\nQUESTION: And you treat the failure to make a\nclosing statement or the failure to put in any evidence\nwhatsoever exactly as if he were a fully qualified lawyer\nin such a case.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. You'd look at whether\nit's objectively reasonable, and that would be whether\ncounsel is inexperienced or had some substance abuse\nproblem. Those cases are -- are all governed under\nStrickland.\nAnd continuing why it would be inappropriate to\n-- to apply Cronic as opposed to Strickland to claims of\nattorney errors, I just want to make one last point, and\nthat is that a test that would sort of say, well, if\ncounsel's performance was just not meaningful enough, that\nthis would be judicially unmanageable and would lack any\nof the policy justifications for presuming prejudice that\nthe Court noticed in Strickland, because the Court would\nhave to look at the entire record and determine whether\ncounsel's performance was deficient enough so as to\nwarrant a presumption of prejudice.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that under Burger v.\nKemp, if the district court in this case had wanted to\ninquire about the availability of other evidence, it was\nprecluded from doing so because it hadn't been introduced\nin the State collateral proceedings?\nMS. BLATT: The district court ruled that that\n-- that those claims were procedurally barred under an\nadequate and independent State procedure. Now, if the\nCourt reverses the Sixth Circuit, I think respondent would\nbe able to argue that those weren't procedurally barred on\nremand, but those -- those claims were not considered by\nthe district court or the State court proceedings --\nQUESTION: So, it's a State procedural bar rule\nif the evidence is not adduced at the State collateral\nproceeding, as opposed to Federal deference?\nMS. BLATT: It was a procedural --\nQUESTION: Under Burger?\nMS. BLATT: In this context, the claims were not\nmade until subsequent post-conviction State court\nproceedings. So, the State courts held that those --\nthose additional grounds for ineffective assistance were\nprocedurally barred.\nQUESTION: So, it was just the failure to adduce\nthe -- to make the claim rather than to elicit the\nevidence?\nMS. BLATT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Hutton, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. HUTTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HUTTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe main problem in this case is not specific\nattorney errors. The problem in this case is the failure\nof John Dice to make a case for life in response to the\nState's case for death in the penalty phase of a capital\ntrial.\nQUESTION: Well, he did say something initially,\ndid he not, at the sentencing phase?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice O'Connor, he did but I\nwould like to clear up one thing that Mr. Moore stated.\nQUESTION: Just -- I hope you will address that\nbecause if he actually did something but it was somehow\ninadequate assistance, then perhaps Strickland is the\ntest.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice --\nQUESTION: But if he did absolutely nothing,\nthen we have to wrestle with whether you divide it from,\nyou know, sentencing phase from guilt/innocence phase, and\nso forth.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice O'Connor, Mr. Dice did make\nan opening statement, but in that opening statement, he\nalso told the jury that he had a right to put on evidence\nat the penalty phase and had a right to make a closing\nargument in the penalty phase.\nQUESTION: And it's really bad performance, you\ncan argue, having -- especially having made that\nstatement, not to do it. But that's -- you know, you --\nyou can prove it was bad performance, and if you can prove\nthat it -- that -- that it adversely affected the outcome,\nthen -- then you have a case. But -- but I don't think\nthat it proves that he wasn't there.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Scalia, the problem in this\ncase and the reason there's a total abdication of advocacy\nis because after the State made a case for death, after\nthe State put on proof of aggravating circumstances and\nthen argued to the jury that the law required the jury to\nput Mr. Cone to death, there was silence. Mr. Dice put\nforth no countervailing proof and made no countervailing\nargument.\nQUESTION: Well, he had -- he had asked\nquestions on cross examination, and it may be that he was\nsatisfied that the State hadn't shown much.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice --\nQUESTION: And he wasn't going to give them an\nopportunity to have some stem-winder -- and -- and this is\nnot standard but it is -- it is not an unknown strategy.\nIt used to happen in the -- in the Court of Appeals in the\nNinth Circuit. There'd be an attorney who'd stand up.\nHe'd talk for just two or three minutes and quietly about\nthe law and then he'd sit down. And -- and then he'd take\n27 minutes on rebuttal to make this huge jury speech. And\nso, what they used to do with him was they'd just submit\nit on the briefs. And he couldn't say anything at all.\nIt was a very effective strategy for that particular\nadvocate.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Kennedy, the only role of\nan advocate in the penalty phase of a capital trial is to\nmake a case for life. A case for life is made by evidence\nand argument. Those are the only two tools that a lawyer\nhas. For the lawyer, after the State makes a case, to say\nnothing implies to the jury that I have no good reply for\nthat.\nQUESTION: Or it implies to the jury that the\nState has shown nothing. That's a completely permissible\ninference, and counsel does that -- has been known to do\nthat.\nQUESTION: We have counsel up here sometimes who\nsay, I -- I waive rebuttal. I mean, you know, I do not\ntake that to mean I agree with what our opponent has said.\nTo the contrary, I take it to mean our opponent's -- our\nopponent's case -- the additional facts he's -- he's\nbrought up are so insignificant that I don't have anything\nelse to say.\nMR. HUTTON: But Justice Scalia, if a member of\nthe Court asked a question of counsel and counsel stood\nsilent, the necessary implication of that is I have no\ngood reply for that question.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hutton, this was a very short\nproceeding. The opening was no shorter than the rather\nmild presentation by the prosecutor. And one thing that\nreally surprised me is -- I'm looking at pages 23 to 27 of\nthe appendix.\nMR. HUTTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It shows that Mr. Dice did -- did\nsomething. And his last statement to the jury -- you said\nhe didn't -- didn't ask for mercy. Well, what do you make\nof this statement where he said, \"And I would say to you\nthat mercy -- if you consider life under the mitigating\ncircumstances, and the aggravating circumstances -- raises\nyou above the State, raises you above the king, if you\nwill. It raises you to the level of God.\" I thought that\nwas a pretty affecting plea for mercy.\nMR. HUTTON: Well, Your Honor, I would submit we\nknow that Mr. Dice was suffering from mental illness at\nthe time he testified. He was declared incompetent to\npractice law in February 1986 by Dr. Hutson, his own\ndoctor.\nQUESTION: I'm asking you about those words.\nThat sounds like a plea for mercy to me.\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, I think -- I would\nsubmit that that's more of a statement of grandiosity, but\neven if it was a plea for mercy, our position is that\nafter the opening statements, nothing happened to make a\ncase for life.\nQUESTION: I'd like you to go into that. I had\nexactly the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg. I didn't\nunderstand why this isn't a very competent presentation,\nlet alone ineffective. What's ineffective about it?\nHis whole case, which the jury heard the day\nbefore, was that this man suffered from Vietnam Syndrome\nand he had four psychiatrists testifying, and by the time\nyou finish reading the excerpts of it, he had a point.\nAnd his point was that the personality of the defendant\nchanged totally after he went to Vietnam, which drove him\nto drugs, which led to this killing, to the point where he\nwas irresponsible and couldn't be held legally responsible\nfor the death.\nNow, the jury the day before has heard all that.\nOut of a two-hour presentation on the death penalty part,\nhe -- 15 minutes of it is taken up by him going back over\nthat. His having reviewed the whole thing, and the\nprosecution having put on three witnesses, who were\nirrelevant, because they talked about his criminal\nbehavior after he returned from Vietnam, leads the defense\nlawyer to say I'm saying nothing. Well, why should he say\nanything? The prosecution just made his case for him.\nNow, I'm telling you my reaction after reading\nit, so that I can get your response.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Breyer, there -- there are\ntwo points in response. First of all, in a weighing\nState, our position is that the failure to make a case for\n-- for life after the State's case for death, necessarily\nimplies resignation to the State's case.\nQUESTION: In other words, you're saying on that\npart --\nMR. HUTTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that when Paul Freund sometimes\nhas said, a lawyer in this Court who sits down saying\nnothing makes not just a good argument, but a perfect\nargument. Now, we all know that. Right? I'm calling\nthat to your mind.\nMR. HUTTON: Okay.\nQUESTION: My reading this transcript led me to\nthink maybe it wasn't the perfect response, but it was a\ngood one, because in the introductory statement -- I'll\nrepeat myself -- he made all these arguments. The\nprosecution never refuted one of them, and the witnesses\nwere irrelevant to those.\nNow, my question to you is, why does he have to\ncome back and make a statement that he knows will elicit\nan answer?\nMR. HUTTON: Number one, Your Honor, it's not\njust the failure to make a statement. It's the failure to\nput -- to make a statement and put on proof. The guilt\nphase proof was not sufficient for a couple of reasons.\nThe first reason it wasn't sufficient is\nbecause, number one, the jury -- it was never explained to\nthe jury that evidence that they had just rejected for an\ninsanity defense could, nonetheless, be mitigating\nevidence.\nNumber two, there was a problem in this record\nthat the State post-conviction --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Before you go on to\nnumber two, didn't -- didn't he make that clear to the\njury in his -- in his opening statement in the -- in the\npenalty phase?\nMR. HUTTON: No, Your Honor. He never explained\nto the jury. What he explained to the jury was there\nwould be a jury instruction that they could consider any\nevidence of aggravating circumstances or mitigating\ncircumstances raised by the evidence. It was never\nexplained to the jury, though, that evidence that they had\nrejected for an insanity defense could, nevertheless, be\nused for mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.\nQUESTION: And he did not allude to that\nevidence?\nMR. HUTTON: No, Your Honor. He alluded to the\nevidence, but he did not allude to the fact that they\ncould consider -- he did not explain to the jury that they\ncould consider that evidence for mitigating evidence.\nQUESTION: Well, but surely the jury would\nassume that they could consider it if he referred to it.\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, for a jury who's just\nrejected an insanity defense -- and this will -- Justice\nScalia, this plays into the second point, too. There\nwas --\nQUESTION: What about this statement? He says,\nthe defense has put on proof of those mitigating\ncircumstances during its case. Now I'd like to review\nthose for you. And at that point, he goes back over the\ntestimony that the psychiatrists had given the day before.\nWhat's that, but to present to the jury the mitigating\nevidence that took place the day before?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Breyer, the -- the problem\nwith that evidence was that the post-conviction court made\na finding there was prosecutorial misconduct where the\nprosecution improperly argued that the jury should not\nbelieve the evidence with respect to drug usage. That's\non page 81 of the joint appendix.\nThere was a finding that the lawyer for the State in\nthe closing argument said, Gary Cone is a drug dealer.\nYou can find that because of the evidence of the money in\nthe car. The State court on post-conviction said they\nshould not have argued that because they knew the money\ncame from a robbery.\nBut the problem was that even though that didn't\nraise to a substantive claim for relief, it nonetheless\ntainted the evidence for mitigation evidence because the\nprosecution's misstatements led the jury to believe, oh,\nhe was not a drug user, he was a drug dealer. Mr. Dice\nnever cleared that up in the sentencing phase.\nQUESTION: All right. Can you go to -- I don't\nwant you to lose two, though. You were cut off. I asked\nmy question and I colored the facts against you.\nMR. HUTTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Because I want to elicit from you\nwhat your response is. And I've got your first, and now I\nwant the second.\nMR. HUTTON: The second response is a temporal\nresponse, Justice Breyer, that in a weighing State, when a\njury is told they have to weigh the evidence for life, a\nlife sentence versus the evidence for death, for the\nlawyer, after the State makes a case for life, to put\nforth no affirmative proof, and then when the State argues\nto the jury why the evidence that just mounted a case for\ndeath necessitates under the law a sentence of death, to\nfail to respond with argument as well is an abdication of\nadvocacy.\nQUESTION: Well, you know, I have trouble with\nthat because I don't think the State put on very much, and\nif I'm sitting waiting for this closing argument, I know\nwhat I'm going to hear. This is a brutal crime spree\nwhere he shot a police officer, shot a citizen, robbed a\njewelry store -- I forget all of the facts. But he goes\nthrough a high-speed chase. He murders an elderly,\nhelpless couple. That's the kind of thing that I'd be\nterrified to have the jury hear, and the State is waiting\nfor closing argument, and he prevents that by sitting\ndown. That may be a good strategy.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Kennedy, the problem is\nwhen there is no -- there was no strategy, because after\nthe opening statements -- it's just like another trial\nwhere you have opening statements, argument, and closing.\nAfter the opening statements, there was nothing that was\nput on. He failed to make a case for life when cases for\nlife could have been made about his being awarded with the\nBronze Star for heroic combat in Vietnam. Even though\nthere was an elicit -- it was elicited on page 31 of the\njoint appendix in cross examination, that there was a\nBronze Star --\nQUESTION: But then the prosecutor says, this\nman with a Bronze Star killed a helpless, innocent couple.\nIs this a hero? He avoids all of that.\nMR. HUTTON: But Justice Kennedy, at least then\nthe jury has something to weigh. There's not the problem\nwith Mr. Dice's silence saying, now that I've heard the\nState's case, I have no good reply for it.\nQUESTION: All right. So, what I -- I think\nmaybe some of us are worried about the same thing. In\nthis case if Mr. Dice was following the strategy that my\nquestion suggested, it didn't work, did it?\nMR. HUTTON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: No. All right.\nBut there could be a future case in which a\nsimilar strategy would work. So, how can I write an\nopinion that says to a defense lawyer in a future death\ncase, even though your best judgment is to keep quiet at\nthis moment, nonetheless the Supreme Court of the United\nStates has said you have to get up and say something, with\nthe consequence that the jury comes back death? What do I\ndo about that in your opinion?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Breyer, put another way,\nthe question the Court is asking is whether or not a\nlawyer can strategically decide to abandon advocacy.\nQUESTION: All he has abandoned is his closing\nstatement. He put all the thing in front of the jury in\nhis opening statement. So, he's abandoning his closing\nstatement. Now, you want me to say that he cannot abandon\nthat.\nMR. HUTTON: No, Justice Breyer. It's the -- a\ncombination of abandoning the closing statement and any\ncase for life, any affirmative case which leads to there\nbeing no case for life in response to the State's case for\ndeath.\nQUESTION: No, but Mr. Hutton, the problem that\nI think we're all having with your argument is -- is\nillustrated by the -- the colloquy that keeps going on.\nYou're saying that in these circumstances the deficiency\nwas so clear that it should be treated as a Cronic case,\nas if the lawyer were not there at all. But the very fact\nthat we're having the discussion that we are shows that it\nisn't so clear.\nAnd -- and the point that I wish you'd address\n-- and I -- I have to say that I don't know how you can\naddress it, but the point that you've got to address if --\nif you're -- if you're going to prevail here is how can we\napply Cronic if we are to apply in -- in any intelligible\nway, in any way that has a limiting principle to it, if\nthe application of Cronic is going to depend on\nassessments of lawyers' judgments which are as disputable\nas this assessment?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Souter, it's our position\nthat, in essence, the lawyer's judgments are irrelevant to\na Cronic analysis, that Cronic looks at the structure --\nQUESTION: Well, that's the whole problem,\nbecause if we were analyzing it under Strickland, we would\nhave a different sort of inquiry, and maybe it fits better\nhere.\nLet me ask you this, Mr. Hutton. Suppose we\ndisagree with you and with the Sixth Circuit that Cronic\nis the test. We have two questions here: the Williams v.\nTaylor issue under section 2254, and then this\nStrickland/Cronic. Suppose we think that Strickland\nprovides the test. That isn't the end of the road for\nyour client, presumably?\nMR. HUTTON: No, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: What would happen then? And how\nshould we address it with these two questions? Do we deal\nwith 2254 first as a threshold question?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice O'Connor, if I could take\nboth of your questions in the order you presented them.\nFirst of all, if this Court determines that\nStrickland applies, the case would have to be remanded to\nthe Sixth Circuit. We had requested an evidentiary\nhearing to develop many of these facts in the district\ncourt, which was denied. The Sixth Circuit never\naddressed the issues about the failure to afford a -- an\nevidentiary hearing and many State procedural default\nissues that were raised that concern a novel\ninterpretation of State law being raised in Mr. Cone's own\ncase, and whether there were adequate and independent\nState grounds.\nQUESTION: You know, it's -- it puts you in a\nbad position for me to ask you this, but just assume, if\nyou would for a minute, that we think Strickland applies.\nThen what should we do here in the face of these two\nquestions, and where does that leave your client?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice O'Connor, the -- if\nStrickland did apply, the 2254(d) question could not be\nresolved until first the procedural default issues and the\nfailure to afford an evidentiary hearing questions are\nresolved by the Sixth Circuit.\nQUESTION: Why do we not decide the -- the\nStrickland question here?\nMR. HUTTON: Chief Justice, there are several\nissues that -- that of -- that were not developed in the\ndistrict court with respect to deficient performance and\nprejudice. Those facts would have -- would have to be\ndeveloped before this Court could make a determination of\nwhether or not the State court unreasonably applied\nclearly established Federal law.\nQUESTION: What were those --\nQUESTION: Were these questions dealing with the\nguilt phase or the penalty phase?\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, these are all questions\nthat apply to application of Sixth Amendment, the failure\nto develop evidence --\nQUESTION: I -- I asked you a specific question.\nWere these questions devoted to the penalty phase or the\nguilt phase?\nMR. HUTTON: With respect to the penalty phase\nspecifically, Chief Justice Rehnquist, with respect to\ndeveloping proof as to deficient performance, why the\nfindings of fact should not be trusted because --\nQUESTION: Mr. Hutton, didn't the Sixth Circuit\nreject your claim about the guilt phase?\nMR. HUTTON: No -- what they rejected, there was\nan issue of waiver of certain claims, not the Sixth\nAmendment claims, but other claims that was denied by the\ndistrict court, and the Sixth Circuit found that those\nissues were waived.\nWith respect to the ineffective assistance\nclaims, the issue has to do with in State court there was\na finding that those claim -- that those aspects of the\nSixth Amendment claim were previously determined, and in,\nthis case is the first time that the State court held a\nfinding of previous determination can act as a procedural\nbar to developing those issues in -- in State court. So,\nthere's a novel issue of State law that --\nQUESTION: Can you -- can you point to me where\nin the Sixth Circuit opinion -- I thought in their opinion\nthey rejected your claim insofar as the guilt phase.\nPerhaps I'm wrong.\nMR. HUTTON: No, Justice Ginsburg. They\nrejected the issue of waiver. They did not address at all\nin the opinion the claim in the brief with respect to why\nthe State court finding of previous determination with\nrespect to aspects of a Sixth Amendment claim raised in\nthe subsequent State post-conviction petition -- why we\nargued that that cannot be a bar to reaching the issues on\nthe merits in Federal court because it was a novel rule.\nIt was a rule announced for the first time in Mr. Cone's\nown case.\nSecondly, there are Michael Williams v. Taylor\nproblems because there are facts -- when we asked for an\nevidentiary hearing, we were not afforded an evidentiary\nhearing to develop many of these facts with respect to the\nBronze Star. The district court didn't give us a hearing.\nAnd we have cause. It wasn't our fault for failing to\ndevelop those in -- in State court.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I -- I don't -- I don't\nreally understand. If the test -- if the criterion is --\nis going to be whether the -- as the statute says, whether\nthe State court was reasonable in what it did, what right\ndo you have to introduce new evidence that wasn't\npresented to the State courts?\nMR. HUTTON: Because --\nQUESTION: I don't understand why we can't just\n-- just look at the evidence that was available and -- and\ndecide the Strickland question then.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Scalia, that fits right\ninto this court's decision with Michael Williams v.\nTaylor. 2254(e) allows an evidentiary hearing to be held\nin Federal court if it was not the defendant's fault for\nfailing to develop facts. That provision would make no\nsense if a Federal court couldn't look at new facts not\ndeveloped in State court to make a determination under\n2254(d) as to whether or not the State court findings were\nreasonable or unreasonable. In other words, Justice --\nQUESTION: Do we have any indication here as to\nwhose fault it was?\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, there's several\ndifferent issues, Justice Souter. First of all, in State\ncourt, capital defendants were not allowed experts or\ninvestigators until 1995, years after Mr. Cone's first\npost-conviction petition. So, there's an issue about\ncause with whether or not he had cause to develop that.\nNumber two, with the aspects of the Sixth\nAmendment claim raised in a second post-conviction\npetition, there are issues as to whether the State\nprocedural bar was clearly established, because Mr. Cone's\ncase was the very first case where there was a holding\nthat previous determination acted as a State bar to\ndeveloping facts in State court. All of those issues go\nto whether or not Mr. Cone has a right under Michael\nWilliams v. --\nQUESTION: What facts is it -- what facts is it\n-- are they that you sought to develop --\nMR. HUTTON: Chief --\nQUESTION: -- as bearing on the ineffective\nassistance claim?\nMR. HUTTON: Chief Justice, there are several\nfacts, starting with the deficient performance aspect. We\nknow because we were able to issue a subpoena in Federal\ncourt to get John Dice's medical records. He committed\nsuicide after the post-conviction hearing. His own\nrecords show at the time that he testified in post-\nconviction, he was suffering from impaired memory,\nconfused thinking, and had been incompetent to practice\nlaw.\nQUESTION: well, why -- how does that bear on\nwhether or not the State court's finding of -- against you\non the Strickland claim was unreasonable?\nMR. HUTTON: Because, Chief Justice, many of the\nfindings by the State court relied on the testimony of\nJohn Dice, and just like under the old Townsend v. Sain --\nQUESTION: Well, Townsend against Sain is pretty\nwell gone.\nMR. HUTTON: No, Your Honor, but it also comes\ninto Michael Williams v. Taylor, this Court's 2000 term --\nyear 2000 opinion, where if it's not -- if we didn't fail\nto develop facts in -- in State court that are relevant,\nwe can develop them in Federal court.\nQUESTION: What is -- what is the particular\nthing, though, because I mean, you've mentioned three\ntimes now that he has some mental problem that led him to\ncommit suicide.\nMR. HUTTON: Yes.\nQUESTION: I gather that must have been at least\nfour or five years after these events.\nMR. HUTTON: It was --\nQUESTION: He testified at the hearing in 1986.\nThe trial was in 1982.\nMR. HUTTON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, I've seen many bad\ncases of bad representation in death cases that I think is\nterrible. But I have to say, having read through this\nrecord, this doesn't seem to be one of them. Now, you\nobviously think it is.\nSo, what is it specifically? What is it\nspecifically that -- that you think was absolutely\nterrible by way of representation here, other than not\nmaking the closing statement? I've got that one. I\nunderstand that. You've made a major point of that. But\nwhat are the things that really went wrong in this case?\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Breyer, with respect to\nyour first question, we're raising the fact that he\ncommitted suicide after the post-conviction testimony so\nthat -- that raises --\nQUESTION: That does not suggest that four or\nfive years earlier -- it might suggest a cause of bad\nrepresentation, but it doesn't suggest there was the bad\nrepresentation. And my question is what did he do wrong?\nI'm not an experienced trial lawyer. That's why I put\nthese questions to you. I expect my objections will be\noverwhelmed by you, but I want you to -- to focus you on\ndoing it.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Breyer, he failed to make a\ncase for life. In the penalty phase of a capital trial,\nit's like a totally new trial, and a lawyer has one goal.\nIt's to mount a case for life, for the jury to have some\nreason not to sentence his client to death.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hutton, may I interrupt you with\nthis? And I -- because I think we're all trying to get at\nthe same thing. When you get beyond that generality, what\nwas it that he should have put in that he didn't put in?\nAnd my understanding was that there were three items that\nyou thought would be favorable. One was the Bronze Star.\nOne was the fact that this man's brother died when he was\nyoung, and the third was that this man's girlfriend was\nmurdered. Am I -- am I right that those are the three\npoints upon which you thought he was deficient in -- the\nlawyer, Dice, was deficient in failing to present\nevidence?\nMR. HUTTON: With -- Justice Souter, there are\nmany cases for life that could have been made. It is true\nthat he failed to develop the Bronze Star and failed to\ndevelop that Mr. Cone was a hero, that that is an award\nfor heroism in combat. That was never presented to the\njury as a case for life.\nNumber --\nQUESTION: Was there nothing in the military\nrecord that the lawyer might have been fearful about if he\npursued that beyond where he did?\nMR. HUTTON: No, Justice Ginsburg. And that\nalso reminds me I'd like to clarify something. There is\ntestimony in the post-conviction record at page 158 of the\npost-conviction testimony -- it's not in the joint\nappendix, unfortunately. But John Dice did testify that\nhe would have given his right arm for a Bronze Star, that\nthat was an award for combat in military service.\nQUESTION: May I just -- I've looked back at the\nopinion, and twice the Sixth Circuit says that they deny\nthe -- they affirm the dismissal. They affirm the\ndismissal with respect to the conviction. We now affirm\nthe denial of this petition with respect to the offense of\n-- of conviction. And if you missed it there, then on the\nvery last page of this opinion, they say again, we affirm\nthe district court's refusal to issue a writ of habeas\ncorpus with respect to the petitioner's conviction. And\nyou didn't cross appeal from that.\nMR. HUTTON: No, Your Honor. The -- the issues\n-- the issue is whether or not counsel was ineffective for\nthe sentencing phase. We did not -- the -- we --\nQUESTION: I thought you -- you told me when I\nasked you, no, the Sixth Circuit didn't affirm with\nrespect to the sentence of conviction. I take from what I\njust read to you that they did, and that's a closed door,\nand the only thing that's up now is the sentencing phase.\nMR. HUTTON: Oh, I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I\nmust have misunderstood your question. The -- the\nconviction of guilt was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit and\nwe did not file a cross petition.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HUTTON: Okay. The -- so, the issues which\nwe are raising have to do with why Mr. Dice was\nineffective to the point that it amounted to a total\nabdication of advocacy in the penalty phase of the\ncapital --\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: Is the first --\nQUESTION: Can I ask you one question following\nup on Justice Souter? He listed three things. He said\nthat you argue he failed to put in. But I thought the\nmost significant material that was omitted was the story\nof what kind of a person this man was before he went to\nVietnam, which the lawyer said he had investigated and\ndescribed in detail at page 62 of the joint appendix.\nNow, did he explain why he didn't put all that evidence\nin?\nMR. HUTTON: No. Your Honor, there were some\nreferences by Mr. Dice's testimony that he thought that\nthe mother, Valeree Cone, did not make a good witness and\nthat generally the family members he thought did not make\na good witness.\nQUESTION: Did that come during the -- had that\ncome in during the guilt stage?\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, he -- when he tried to\nintroduce evidence in the guilt phase, there were\nobjections as to relevancy which were sustained by the\ncourt, because the court found that all that was relevant\nin the guilt phase was the issue of mental insanity. So,\nall the background to -- was not relevant in that\nparticular --\nQUESTION: Did the mother testify --\nQUESTION: Mr. Hutton, you -- you think we have\nto send -- this conviction and sentence occurred in 1982.\nI am trying to think, you know, what I was like in 1982.\nIt's 20 years ago, and you think it has to go back for\nfurther fact finding, presumably back to the court of\nappeals and then back to the district court?\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, first of all, this case\nwas filed --\nQUESTION: How -- how old is -- is Mr. Cone?\nMR. HUTTON: Mr. Cone was 33 in 1982, so that\nwould make him 50 --\nQUESTION: Yes. Well, he may get a -- a life\nsentence by default.\nMR. HUTTON: Justice Scalia, the -- the fact of\nthe matter is, though, that Mr. Cone has been trying to\ndevelop these claims.\nQUESTION: No, but when you go back to that,\nwhat is it that you -- that you say should have gone on in\nas evidence at the sentencing phase that didn't? The\nBronze Star. Justice Stevens mentioned the change in\npersonality. Is that something that you say should have\ngone in?\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, that should have gone\nin. The fact about the Bronze Star and being developed\nwhat happened in the war should have gone in. There are\nclaims about Mr. Dice's --\nQUESTION: What -- what about the other two that\nI mentioned, the -- the death of the sister and the murder\nof -- of the -- the girlfriend? Should those things have\ngone in?\nMR. HUTTON: Yes, Your Honor, because they would\nportray --\nQUESTION: Okay. I'm pushing you because your\ntime is running out. What else? Is there anything else?\nMR. HUTTON: Your Honor, those should have gone\nin, but more importantly, those should have been woven\ninto an argument as to why that reasoned moral judgment --\na reasoned moral judgment called for this man not to be\nput to death. And the fact of the matter is the\ncombination -- we can't piecemeal the no evidence and no\nargument. It's the combined force of both of them. The\nfailure to do anything in response to the State's case for\ndeath is what makes this a total abdication of advocacy in\nthe context of a penalty phase of a capital trial.\nSo, Your Honors, in preparing for this argument,\nI read an article that one of Your Honors wrote several\nyears ago about how important oral argument was before\nthis Court and how in many cases this Court -- argument\nhad affected the minds of members of this Court. And if\noral argument is so important for members of this Court\nwho have the benefits of briefs, training, legal training,\nthe benefits of clerks, how much more important is\nargument for a jury that's not trained in the law, that\ndoesn't have the benefits of briefs, that has to make the\nmost difficult decision they ever made as to whether\nsomebody should live or should die? And how much more\ndevastating is it when the jury is told they have to weigh\nevidence, they hear a case for death, they hear the\nprosecutor argue a case for death, and then there's\nsilence from the defense?\nYour Honor, that amounts to a total failure in\nthe penalty phase to -- to subject the prosecution's case\nto meaningful adversarial testing. That's why this Court\nwrote Cronic, to talk about problems just like this case.\nAnd Cronic has been sparingly applied by the lower courts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you. Thank you,\nMr. Hutton.\n"
