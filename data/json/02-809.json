        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-809, Maryland v. Joseph Jermaine Pringle.\nMr. Bair.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhen the officer stopped the car respondent was\nriding in and found drugs packaged for distribution in the\nrear seat armrest, and then also found a large amount of\ncash in the glove compartment -\nQUESTION: What - the rear seat armrest was\npushed up -\nMR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - and then the drugs were behind the -\nthe armrest?\nMR. BAIR: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The rear seat\narmrest was pushed up against the rear seat. The officer\nmerely folded it down and then the drugs appeared, and\nthese are drugs that were packaged in five separate\nindividual packages that were packaged for distribution at\n$20 a bag. The officer also found $763 in a rolled-up\nball of cash in the glove compartment, and there - at that\ntime there was individualized probable cause that focused\non all three people in that car, and this is so for three\nprincipal reasons. First -\nQUESTION: At the end of the day, what happened?\nMR. BAIR: At the end of the day, all three were\narrested, respondent confessed, and said the -\nQUESTION: And respondent was a front seat\npassenger?\nMR. BAIR: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: He's the one who confessed?\nMR. BAIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: And was found ultimately guilty of -\nMR. BAIR: He was found -\nQUESTION: - some drug-related offense?\nMR. BAIR: He was found guilty both of possession\nand possession with intent to distribute.\nQUESTION: And the other two?\nMR. BAIR: The other two were not charged\nformally after respondent confessed. The officer made a\ndiscretionary decision not to charge the other two at the\nstation house after respondent confessed to this crime.\nQUESTION: Do you say that there was probable\ncause for the arrest of all three at the time they were\nfound?\nMR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Was there probable cause sufficient to\nsupport charges at a preliminary hearing -\nMR. BAIR: I think there would have been.\nQUESTION: - against all three?\nMR. BAIR: I - yes, Justice O'Connor, I think\nthere would have been. I think, given the circumstances\nof this arrest, the mere fact that one of the three\nconfessed doesn't ultimately determine that the other two\nwere not culpable.\nQUESTION: Is there any additional requirement\nfor establishing probable cause at a preliminary hearing\nabove and beyond what's needed for the arrest, or are they\nidentical, in your opinion?\nMR. BAIR: I would say they're identical, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: So - so under - under that view,\nassume no confession, hypothetical case, under that view,\nthese people, all of the three could have been bound over\nfor trial?\nMR. BAIR: I believe so. I believe so.\nQUESTION: And under that view, any motion to\ndismiss prior to trial would have to be denied?\nMR. BAIR: I believe there would have been\nprobable cause to charge and to take the cases to trial.\nQUESTION: And I suppose what happens in that\ncase is the judge says, and I want to tell you right up\nfront I think this is a very skimpy case, you'd better\ncome up with something - I guess that's the way it works -\nMR. BAIR: I think so -\nQUESTION: But there's - but the - as Justice\nO'Connor said, it's probable cause and it's the same\nstandard - excuse me - it's the same standard to bind over\non arraignment as it is for the officer to arrest?\nMR. BAIR: My understanding from the case law,\nYour Honor, is that probable cause is probable cause, be\nit to search, to arrest, or it - I think it's a fluid\nconcept, obviously depending on the exact context, and I'm\nnot saying that a prosecutor would not exercise discretion\nas would a police officer in a given case not to take a\ncase forward.\nQUESTION: Well, a preliminary hearing is largely\na matter of Maryland law, isn't it, or State law?\nMR. BAIR: It is and -\nQUESTION: I mean, is there any - any\nconstitutional requirement that there be a preliminary\nhearing before a criminal case is tried?\nMR. BAIR: Not that I know of, Your Honor, no.\nQUESTION: Well, I take it even under the\nConstitution, if it's a Federal case, both the indictment\nand the - or the information shows simply probable cause,\nthat's enough to bind over?\nMR. BAIR: I believe so, Justice Kennedy, I\nbelieve so. Now, in this case, of course, there was -\nQUESTION: But if you say it's fluid, that - that\nconcerns me. I was somewhat puzzled by what the\nGovernment said in its brief, page 26 to 28, it says,\nwell, you know, it's fluid, the prosecutor takes a second\nlook and it - it sounds as if the prosecutor has a greater\nburden, but I - I'm not sure that that's the law.\nMR. BAIR: I'm not sure it's a greater burden. I\nthink the prosecutor's decision, of course, is looking\nforward to trial where they know that they have to prove\nthe case beyond a reasonable doubt. They know they have\nto get past a motion for judgment of acquittal. The\npolice officer on the scene is making the same type of\ndecision vis-a-vis probable cause but it's in a very\ndifferent context. I think that's the difference.\nQUESTION: In your view, is this very fact-\nspecific so that it might come out differently if the\nmoney and the drugs had been located in some little pocket\nnext to the driver as opposed to some rear seat passenger\nor other passenger?\nMR. BAIR: I think one factor that would\nsignificantly change the totality of the circumstances\nhere would be, for instance, if the drugs had been found\non the person of one of the passengers.\nQUESTION: No, that wasn't my question. What if\n-\nMR. BAIR: If it had been -\nQUESTION: - they were found very close to the\ndriver, you know, sometimes there's a little pocket right\nnext to -\nMR. BAIR: In the door?\nQUESTION: - on the door, on the driver's side.\nSuppose it were there but you had a passenger in the front\nand in the rear. Any different result?\nMR. BAIR: Not in this case, no. I think - I\nthink if - if the drugs are found in a common area of the\npassenger compartment of the car -\nQUESTION: How about the trunk?\nMR. BAIR: I think the trunk changes things a\nlittle bit, but of course you have to look at the totality\nof the circumstances, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Why a little bit? I thought this\nwhole case was predicated - your whole case was predicated\non those drugs between the armrest and the backseat were\naccessible to all three people in that car.\nMR. BAIR: That's -\nQUESTION: Now, if you have something in a locked\ntrunk, it truly is not accessible to the passengers.\nMR. BAIR: It certainly is not as accessible, and\nof course it's not as immediately accessible, but, for\ninstance, if there had been a large quantity of drugs in\nthe trunk or if there had been a dead body in the trunk, I\nthink then there is a - the calculus changes in terms of\ntotality of the circumstances, and I think if it were that\nsituation, even though that particular evidence was in the\ntrunk, I think there's still a - a strong inference that\ncould be drawn that everyone in the car knew about it,\nbecause who would take the chance in terms of taking along\ninnocent passengers -\nQUESTION: Well, let's stick to the five - these\nfive bags that were stuck in a Ziploc bag. The Ziploc bag\nis in the trunk, not a dead body.\nMR. BAIR: I understand. I think in that case\nthere would be a much closer case, it would be a much more\ndifficult case vis-a-vis all three occupants of the car.\nQUESTION: But under -\nQUESTION: Okay, what about the -\nQUESTION: - under - under your view, if - if the\ncar is in a high crime area and some mother gets a ride\nfrom her son who she perhaps doesn't know has been\ninvolved in drugs, then if drugs are found anywhere in\nthat car, she's subject to arrest and - and sufficient for\ncharge?\nMR. BAIR: Not - not -\nQUESTION: I mean, suppose it's at - in the\nmiddle of the day and she's going to the grocery store, we\ndon't have it at 3:00 a.m. in an area where drugs are\nfrequently sold. Does that enter into the calculus?\nMR. BAIR: I think it does, Your Honor. I think,\nobviously with - with - with the totality of the\ncircumstances, anytime you change - and, of course, some\nof these are going to have more minor impact, some are\ngoing to have more major impact. But in this case you\nhad, of course, 3:16 in the morning, three men who were\nroughly of the same age who appeared to be intimately\nconnected with one another, you had the drugs and the\nmoney.\nJustice O'Connor -\nQUESTION: What if there had been four people in\nthe car?\nMR. BAIR: I don't know that four people would\nchange things.\nQUESTION: How about six?\nMR. BAIR: I think within the -\nQUESTION: Or what if it was a minivan and there\nwere eight in the minivan?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAIR: I'm not sure it changes it\nsignificantly, Your Honor. I think that the most\nsignificant -\nQUESTION: You think with eight people in the\nminivan you could arrest all eight and hold them over for\ntrial?\nMR. BAIR: I think if you have identical\ncircumstances to these in terms of the time, how well-\nacquainted they all appeared, the fact there was money,\nthe fact that there were drugs packaged for distribution.\nIt appeared to the officer, a reasonable inference, that\nthere was a drug distribution common enterprise.\nQUESTION: But the distribution, as I understand\nit, was just enough to take care of a big party. There\nwas no evidence that they were for sale, was there?\nMR. BAIR: Well, the evidence, at the time the\nofficer made the arrest, I think he could draw an\ninference that there was cash proceeds perhaps of former\ndrug sales, prior drug sales, and there were five\nindividually packaged crack - hits of crack cocaine.\nQUESTION: And the charge was possession with\nintent to distribute, wasn't it?\nMR. BAIR: Yes, it was both simple possession and\npossession with intent to distribute, and he was\nconvicted.\nQUESTION: How about if it had been a bus? Now,\nwe've gone from the sedan to the minivan, how about the\nbus?\nMR. BAIR: I think a bus is different, Your\nHonor. I think a bus changes things significantly in the\n- in the context of, of course, the numbers of people are\nmuch greater, and then there's -\nQUESTION: Are you talking about a public bus or\nyou're talking about a chartered bus?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAIR: I think that would affect obviously\nthe totality of circumstances as well.\nQUESTION: What - what is - what is the rule that\nyou're - there's the restatement hypotheticals -\nRestatement of Torts, where there's the dead body, two\npeople are each accusing the other, and add - I don't know\nhow the hypothetical would work - but add to the mix that\nonly one could have done it. Can you arrest both?\nMR. BAIR: I think you can, Your Honor. I think\nboth the Restatement of Torts, the Model Code of Pre-\nArraignment Procedure, and just the - the nature of\nprobable cause would permit that, because we're talking\nabout -\nQUESTION: The Model Code of Pre-Arraignment\nProcedure just talks again about probable cause?\nMR. BAIR: Same situation where you have, say,\ntwo people, only one of whom could be guilty of the crime.\nYou could still have - you still would have probable cause\nto arrest both.\nQUESTION: But that's two people and here you've\ngot three.\nQUESTION: What about three? I was going to ask,\nwhat about three?\nMR. BAIR: I think three is - is -\nQUESTION: You can arrest all three?\nMR. BAIR: I think so.\nQUESTION: What about five? You're going to\narrest all five? Even - I mean, you know, it gets worse\nand worse -\nMR. BAIR: Well, of course.\nQUESTION: - 10 percent chance, there are 10 of\nthem now -\nMR. BAIR: And - and -\nQUESTION: - so the chance that any individual\none did it is 10 percent. That's still enough?\nMR. BAIR: I think we can't draw - the Court in\nGates said that you cannot quantify probable cause. You\nhave to - in those circumstances -\nQUESTION: It doesn't mean probable.\nMR. BAIR: No, it does not mean probable.\nClearly -\nQUESTION: Why do we call it probable cause?\nMR. BAIR: I'm not - I think there's a bit of a\nmisnomer there, but clearly from the case law of this\nCourt, it means a fair probability, it means something\ngreater than reasonable suspicion under Terry -\nQUESTION: But if you had to reduce it to a\npercentage figure, what would you call the percentage\nrequired for probable cause?\nMR. BAIR: I don't know that I could, Your Honor.\nI really don't know that it's useful to -\nQUESTION: But it's less than 50, though, I\ngather?\nMR. BAIR: Yes. Your - the cases of this Court\nhas said -\nQUESTION: So that takes care of the two people\nin the room, but when you get down to 33-1/3 with three\npeople?\nMR. BAIR: I think - I think three people clearly\nwould be -\nQUESTION: And with four people it would be 25\npercent. Is that enough?\nMR. BAIR: Probably, probably.\nQUESTION: Probably.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You - you agree - you agree that at\nsome point the probability is - when the numbers of people\npresent keep increasing, at some point the probability is\ngoing to be too slim?\nMR. BAIR: Yes, I agree with that. I agree with\nthat, but again, in Illinois v. Gates, this Court said we\nwill not, we cannot, it's not useful to try to quantify\nprobable cause in that way, we still have to look at the\ntotality of the circumstances beyond whether there are two\npeople or three people or whatever.\nQUESTION: And one is -\nMR. BAIR: Of course, on the Government's theory\nI don't think it would matter, because they say you can\ninfer a conspiracy, and I suppose then the whole bus could\nbe in the conspiracy, but if it's an individual approach,\nwhich I think you're taking, then the number of people\nmight make a difference.\nMR. BAIR: I think so. Now, of course, it would\ndepend on - on the crime that the probable cause was going\nto. In this particular crime, of course, drugs can be\njointly and constructively possessed, so clearly in this\nparticular car, all three of the people could be guilty of\nthe crime, not just one.\nQUESTION: Do you accept Justice Stevens'\nsuggestion that your position might differ from the\nGovernment here?\nMR. BAIR: I don't know that it does. I think\nour positions are basically the same.\nQUESTION: So - so you do think a conspiracy can\ngenerally - can be inferred as to all people in these - in\nthe instance like this?\nMR. BAIR: In our case, absolutely, absolutely.\nIn our case, clearly -\nQUESTION: But if one of them -\nQUESTION: But you didn't argue the - excuse me -\nyou didn't argue the conspiracy theory in the State\ncourt, I don't think, did you?\nMR. BAIR: Well, I think we did, Your Honor. I\nthink we argued in the State court that because drugs can\nbe jointly and constructively possessed, that any one,\ntwo, or three of the individuals in the car were - were\nguilty of this crime.\nQUESTION: If you know nothing more than what you\nknow here - I mean, I take it that if - if it were\nundisputed that one of the three was a hitchhiker, you -\nyou would not make the argument with respect to the\nhitchhiker?\nMR. BAIR: I think if - if it's undisputed, and\nof course, that's going to be a difficult situation to -\nto know that there's no actual connection -\nQUESTION: That's the wonderful thing about being\non the Supreme Court.\nMR. BAIR: If it's -\nQUESTION: You can make those assumptions.\nMR. BAIR: If it's undisputed, then I think that\nsignificantly changes, because I think a lot - a core\nconcept here is this notion of common enterprise, that\nwhen you have people in a car together, particularly a\nsmall passenger car, there's an inference, I think in this\ncase a very strong inference, that all three of these\npeople were engaged in a common enterprise. So -\nQUESTION: But do you have - do you need the -\nQUESTION: What if the car - what if the car\nincluded a driver and two hitchhikers and the drugs were\nfound exactly as they were here, and there's obviously no\ncommon enterprise, would there be probable cause?\nMR. BAIR: I guess it would be - of course, that\nwould be a more difficult case because you had the money\nin the glove compartment of the car and the drugs in the\nbackseat of the car, so that -\nQUESTION: I'm not sure the money really adds\nanything to the analysis, to tell you the truth.\nMR. BAIR: I think it adds -\nQUESTION: Because there's certainly nothing\nillegal about carrying money in the glove compartment,\nwhere it is illegal to carry drugs in the - behind the\nseat - the armrest.\nMR. BAIR: Well, certainly the money without the\ndrugs would be a - a different case than the drugs without\nthe money.\nQUESTION: But you -\nQUESTION: The hitchhiker - the hitchhiker\nexample poses a question for the arresting officer,\nbecause does he have to accept the declaration of someone\nthat I'm just a hitchhiker here?\nMR. BAIR: No, and - and that, of course, goes\nback to whether it's undisputed in some way, I don't know\nquite how it would be undisputed. You've always got the -\nthe officer who on the scene is making a reasonable\njudgement from all the facts and circumstances, and one of\nthose is, I don't have to believe the criminal or\ncriminals in this car. I know there are drugs in the car,\nwe have a known crime here being committed in the presence\nof the officer, possession or possession with intent to\ndistribute drugs.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm still curious about the\nanswer to my question. Assume the officer did accept the\ntruth of the representation they were two - two\nhitchhikers picked up at different times, and maybe he was\nfollowing the car, for instance, so he knew that was true,\nand then there's the driver and then there are drugs in\nthe backseat just as there are here. Would there be\nprobable cause in that case?\nMR. BAIR: Two - two answers to that, Justice\nStevens. One, of course, is you would measure the\nprobable cause by an objective standard and not by the\nsubjective standard of that particular police officer.\nThe other is -\nQUESTION: But what is the answer?\nMR. BAIR: The other is, it could be that -\nQUESTION: I thought you were going to say the\ntwo answers were yes and no.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAIR: It could be, Your Honor, that the -\nthe driver knew the hitchhikers and that's why he picked\nthem up. I mean, a lot of times people -\nQUESTION: No, no, no. I'm just assuming the\nonly relevant facts are that it's undisputed they were two\n- two unrelated - they're three unrelated people, they're\njust entirely different backgrounds, one doesn't even\nspeak English and one doesn't speak Spanish, but there are\nthree of them in the car and the drugs are found exactly\nunder the circumstances here. What I'm trying to say - if\nthere were no conspiracy theory, would there be probable\ncause?\nMR. BAIR: I think so, yes. Yes, I think there\nwould be.\nQUESTION: You - you have - you really have to\nsay that based on the dead victim hypothetical that you\nanswered earlier.\nMR. BAIR: I think so, I think so, that - that if\nthe, again, one - the other inference among the - the -\nthe indicators of a common enterprise would be, I think\nit's unusual that several people are going to be taking a\nchance driving around, either with evidence of a murder or\nevidence of a drug conspiracy. They're not simply as a\nmatter of reasonable inferences that an officer can draw,\ntake the chance of having innocent people along.\nUnless there are any further questions, I - I'd\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bair.\nMr. Srinivasan, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe totality of the circumstances apparent to\nthe officer at the scene established probable cause for\nrespondent's arrest. Of particular significance, the\nofficer uncovered drugs that were packaged for\ndistribution and that were concealed in the location in\nwhich they were readily discoverable by the other\npassengers.\nQUESTION: Your brief reads to me - at about page\n15 - to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that\nprobable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car\nanytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in\nthe passenger portion of the car.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's - we don't intend -\nQUESTION: Is that your position?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We don't intend to suggest a\nbroad rule, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that it is a totality of\nthe circumstances test?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, it's a totality of the\ncircumstances test, and it will turn on contextual factors\nthat are present in any particular case.\nQUESTION: Well, you do say at page 15, beginning\nof the first full paragraph, for these reasons, the\ndiscovery of an amount of narcotics suitable for\ndistribution in the passenger compartment supports an\ninference that all of the car's occupants were aware of,\nand hence, involved with the drugs. That's a sweeping\nstatement.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, what - what we intend to\nsay is that ordinarily when drugs that are packaged for\ndistribution are found in a location in which they're\nreadily discoverable by the other passengers, a reasonable\nofficer can fairly conclude that there's a fair\nprobability that each passenger is - is aware of the\ndrugs, but of course in particular cases -\nQUESTION: But it - it might - wouldn't different\nfactors enter into it? Suppose it's a young child -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: - in the vehicle, and it's in the\nmiddle of the day and they're dropping the child off at\nschool or something. Are you suggesting there would\nnonetheless be this inference and the child could be\nhauled up and sent to the juvenile court?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. The inference is tethered\nto the particular facts of this case. In cases that\npresent different facts, for example, if a child was in\nthe car of - if, as was earlier discussed, a hitchhiker\nwere in the car, the probable - probable cause calculus\nwould be different. But in this case there was no reason\nto suspect that any of the individuals was uninvolved in\nthe possession of the cocaine. In fact, what's\nparticularly significant in this case in our view is the\nlocation in which the drugs were found, because they were\nfound wedged behind the rear seat armrest, which\napparently is the type of armrest that's adjustable in an\nup or down position. The very purpose of that type of\narmrest is to give the passenger an option according to\nhis preference whether the position - the armrest in one\nposition or the other, so it's highly -\nQUESTION: The only evidence that supports the\nnotion that some were uninvolved is that as soon as one of\nthem confessed, the police immediately dismissed the\ncharge against the other two, and therefore abandoned the\nnotion that it was a common enterprise.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I - it - there's a - I\nthink there's a different question concerning whether\nthere was probable cause for an arrest and the\ndetermination by an officer whether to proceed with\ncharges. Just because the officer -\nQUESTION: You'd think if the - if the backseat\nperson or whoever it was that confessed had confessed\nwhile the officer was arresting him, there would have\nremained the probable cause as to the other two? Could he\nhave said, I don't believe you, I'll take all three of you\nin anyway?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There might well have been,\nJustice Stevens, because an officer's not required to\nbelieve the version of events that's given to him by\npeople on the scene. It might well be the case that they\nhave a coordinated plan in advance to pin the blame on a\nparticular person as opposed to the other two, and an\nofficer can take into account the totality of\ncircumstances in making that type of assessment.\nQUESTION: May I - may I clarify whether you are\nindeed relying on common enterprise? I thought the view\nwas it may or may not be a common enterprise, but here is\na situation, drugs equally accessible, drugs accessible to\nany one of the three. We can't say whether all three or\nwhich one, so looking at the three, and we say, well, it's\nnot more - not more likely the driver than the front seat\npassenger, who's there behind the money, or the backseat\npassenger, because any one of them could have pulled down\nthat armrest.\nnecessarily a common enterprise.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. It's not necessarily a common enterprise. It\ncould be any one of the three or it could be all of them\nor some combination of the three of them, and the\ncombination of those various scenarios rose to the level\nof a fair probability that respondent was involved with\nthe cocaine. And as I was - as I was saying, that's\nparticularly the case because they were concealed behind\nthe armrest, which is a type of instrument that\naffirmatively invites manipulation by a passenger, so if\none of the occupants of the vehicle alone were responsible\nfor carrying cocaine, it seems quite unlikely that he\nwould have chosen the area behind the armrest as a place\nto conceal it from the other passengers.\nQUESTION: Do - do we demand the same standard\nfrom the arresting officer as we do from the district\nattorney who decides whether or not to proceed to\npreliminary hearing?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The probable cause standard\nworks the same. In both situations the question would be\nwhether there's a fair probability. Now -\nQUESTION: But - but do we demand a higher\nstandard -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's -\nQUESTION: - from either of them in making that\nassessment?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It's often the case that\nprosecutors will have more rigorous standards as a matter\nof internal - matter of internal guidelines. And for\nexample, in the U.S. Attorney's manual, it dictates that\nprosecutors in the Federal system need to ensure that it's\nlikely that they'll be able to obtain a conviction on -\nQUESTION: Well isn't - isn't that - that means\nthe - the probable cause standard is the same, but the\nprosecutor has an obligation to try to find out more and\nget more evidence before he goes forward. Isn't that the\ndifference?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. The nature of the\napplication of the probable cause standard is different in\nthe prosecutorial stage because the prosecutor is\nidentifying a particular offense, laying out the facts to\nsupport that offense, and the -\nQUESTION: But the - but the standard - the\nstandard that determines the - the - the degree of\nlikelihood of inference, that is the same standard,\nwhether we're talking about the police officer or whether\nwe're talking about the district attorney later?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Correct. That remains constant\nin both scenarios.\nQUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying.\nYou're saying it - it can get to the jury with no more\nthan probable cause and should not be thrown out by the\ncourt?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There's a different - there's a\ndifferent question whether the evidence is sufficient to\nconvict as presented by the prosecutor and whether the\nprosecutor has enough to go forward with the charges.\nQUESTION: No, but you're saying the prosecutor\ndoes not have an obligation to refrain from bringing a\nprosecution where he plainly on the face of it doesn't\nhave enough evidence to convict?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: As long as there's probable\ncause to go forward, the prosecutor can go forward with\nthe charges.\nQUESTION: To say plainly on the face of it is\nsomething that a - a prosecutor is seldom confronted with.\nI mean, you've got different people telling different\nstories usually and it's usually a question of who's\nbelieved.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and -\nQUESTION: Well, I'm assuming he has three people\nin the car and the chance for each of them is 33-1/3\npercent -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, he could go -\nQUESTION: - and he prosecutes one of them and he\nhas nothing else. That's all he has, three people in the\ncar, stuff in the back seat -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's -\nQUESTION: - and he picks the passenger and\nbrings a prosecution. The passenger, it could have been\nme, it could have been the other two, 33-1/3 percent.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's - that's different\nfrom the facts of this case, but even assuming that it\nwere an equal likelihood that each of them independently\nwere involved in the offense, the prosecutor could go\nforward in that situation, but it's highly unlikely that\nhe would go forward in that situation because - because\nhe's unlikely to obtain to a verdict in his favor. So\nthere's institutional incentives -\nQUESTION: And the district court probably would\nnot let the case go to the jury if the motion was made at\nthe end of the prosecution's case and this was all you\nhad?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: The prosecution should - the\nprosecutor should bring cases which clearly will not be\nable to go to the jury?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, not should bring cases -\nQUESTION: May, may.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: May, under the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Okay, that's not my understanding of\nthe prosecutor's -\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And that's why, I think,\nprosecutors typically enforce upon themselves a more\nrigorous obligation than the probable cause standard.\nQUESTION: But we have no case saying that they\nmay not proceed?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, there's no case that I'm\naware of that says that they can't proceed where there's\nprobable cause.\nQUESTION: But you just said the manual\ninstructed them not to bring cases to trial.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: In - in the Federal system -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: - there's Federal guidelines\nthat spell out when Federal prosecutors are supposed to\nbring cases to trial, but I'm not aware that that's\nrequired by Federal law or by the Constitution. Each\nprosecutor's office might have their own -\nQUESTION: Do you have readily at hand the - the\ncitation to the manual?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't - I don't have the\nparticular provision.\nQUESTION: Of course, the - the manual wouldn't\nin any way bind Maryland authority.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. Each\nprosecutor's office might have different standards.\nQUESTION: If - if the Federal manual binds\nanyone.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Well, the deficiencies\nin the Maryland court's probable cause analysis, we think,\nare particularly are apparent when one considers the\nimplications for officers at the scene in circumstances\nlike this case, because apparently the up-shot is that\nofficers either could arrest no one or that they could\narrest the driver alone, and the latter situation seems\nunsound because perhaps the least likely scenario in\ncircumstances like this case is that - that the driver was\nacting alone and carrying the contraband in the car,\nbecause if the driver in fact were acting alone, one might\nexpect that he would conceal the contraband in a location\nin which it was not so readily discoverable by the other\npassengers.\nQUESTION: What about the respondent's position\nthat your position means two innocent people may be locked\nup in jail, because suppose Pringle hadn't fessed up, and\nhe exercised his right to remain silent. Then you might\nhave a prolonged periods, assuming they couldn't make\nbail, three people stuck in the brig and two of them are\ninnocent.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it's\npossible that innocent persons will be arrested and bound\nover in circumstances like in this case, but the probable\ncause standard accepts that possibility as the cost of\nensuring the effective enforcement of the criminal laws.\nIn fact, this Court reiterated in Wardlow recently that\nthe probable cause standard accepts that innocent persons\nmay be arrested on occasion. That's simply the cost of a\nfunctioning criminal justice system.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.\nMs. Forster, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY S. FORSTER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. FORSTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis is a unique case with highly unusual facts,\nand the reason it is unique is because of the facts - not\nbecause of the facts that exist so much in this case, but\nbecause of those that do not exist here. There was no\ntestimony whatsoever in this case that Mr. Pringle had\ncontrol over or knowledge of the drugs hidden in the back\nseat of the car -\nQUESTION: Ms. Forster, when you say testimony,\nyou're not referring to any scheduled hearing or formal\nhearing, are you?\nMS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, what the court in\nMaryland reviews on appeal is the motion to suppress\nhearing, and at that hearing there was no evidence\npresented whatsoever that the officer in this case noticed\nany furtive movements by Mr. Pringle, any furtive\ngestures, that he said anything suspicious at the scene,\nor that he acted in any unusually nervous manner. All we\nhave here -\nQUESTION: Well, I thought we were considering\nthis on the basis offered, which is the three people at\n3:30 a.m. in a high crime neighborhood in a sedan where\nthere were a certain quantity of drugs behind the armrest\nand money in the glove compartment.\nMS. FORSTER: A few corrections, if I may,\nJustice O'Connor -\nQUESTION: Three people in the car.\nMS. FORSTER: This is - 3:00 a.m. is accurate,\n3:16 a.m. It is in a residential area. This was not in\nfact a high crime area. And I think that under the\ntotality of circumstances we have to put that in context,\nand the context is this, that it's 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday\nnight with a car of three young men in their twenties in a\nresidential area, and I think that anyone who has children\nof that age knows that often their Saturday night does not\neven begin until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m.\nQUESTION: Well, a lot of people wouldn't refer\nto children as being in their twenties, I think.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FORSTER: Young adult children, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You - you make an interesting opening\nstatement that this is a highly unusual - we've - a lot of\nus read a lot of these cases. It seems to me this happens\nall the time, that drugs in the car, the person says, it's\nnot mine. It seems to me that that's commonplace.\nMS. FORSTER: But what we have here with respect\nto Mr. Pringle is simply presence and nothing more. We\nhave no further -\nQUESTION: But isn't there - isn't there\nsomething more than presence here? Isn't the significance\n- isn't the significant evidence of this case something\nthat appears when you contrast it with Houghton from a\ncouple of years ago? Houghton, you had evidence that the\ndriver of the car was a recreational, a personal drug\nuser. We don't, I think, in this society, at least\ncertainly today, assume that everyone who is in the\ncompany of a recreational drug user is also a drug user or\nan accessory to the first person's drug use. Here,\nhowever, what the police officer had was evidence, not\nmerely of the time, but of - of three people in a\nrelatively small car with commercial quantities of drugs,\nan amount of money that was enough to suggest that drug\ndealing was going on, and I think a - an inference was\npossible that someone in that car was dealing in the\ndrugs.\nAnd it seems to me that the different inference\nthat can be drawn about the others here as distinct from\nthe inference in the Houghton case is, most drug dealers\ndo not go around in their place of business, the car, with\npeople who are totally innocent of drug activity -\nMS. FORSTER: If I -\nQUESTION: - and isn't that the basic difference\nbetween this and Houghton and doesn't that inference\nsupport - amount to probably cause?\nMS. FORSTER: Your Honor, if I - if I may, with\nrespect to this being packaging - the drugs packaged that\nis indicative of sale or for distribution, there was\nabsolutely no evidence in this record that this was\nanything inconsistent with personal use.\nQUESTION: Five - five crack cocaine hits?\nMS. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor. In fact, I think\nthat there are a lot of crack cocaine addicts for which\nthat is a small amount of personal use.\nQUESTION: But is -\nQUESTION: How about a big roll of money?\nMS. FORSTER: And, Your Honor, also, there's a\nproblem with the record in this respect with regard to\nmoney -\nQUESTION: Well, you pointed it out, but I think\nit - I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong here, I thought\nthat it was - it was - the evidence was, regardless of how\nhe first described the quantity that he saw, I thought the\nevidence came out that there was 700 and some odd dollars\nin it, so I think the judge could infer that it was fairly\n- a fairly sizable roll of bills.\nMS. FORSTER: Justice Souter, the actual amount\ndid not come out until the trial. That never came out at\nthe motion to suppress hearing, and in fact, the amount of\nmoney was never characterized at the motion to suppress\nhearing by the officer who testified, other than to say he\nsaw the sum of money, that's all.\nQUESTION: And what is in - and it was in the\nglove compartment?\nMS. FORSTER: It was concealed in the glove\ncompartment?\nQUESTION: And it was open, it wasn't in a wallet\nor something like that?\nQUESTION: A roll of bills.\nMS. FORSTER: We don't - we don't know. In fact,\nthe officer who - Officer Snyder, when he testified at the\nmotion to suppress hearing, simply said that when Mr.\nParlo, the driver of the automobile, went to retrieve his\nlicense and registration from the glove box, that is when\nI saw the money.\nQUESTION: So it's reasonable -\nQUESTION: But he - he must have seen it in the\nform of a - a roll of bills or something, rather than, as\nJustice Souter said, just not in a wallet.\nMS. FORSTER: The record is unclear.\nQUESTION: Well, but, I mean, you - you don't\nhave to have been born yesterday to decide that.\nMS. FORSTER: Well, the - Your Honor, I guess the\npoint is, is that all that was before the trial - the\ntrial judge at the motion to suppress hearing - there was\nnever any characterization of the denomination, the\namount, nothing, just the only thing that was said was the\nmoney.\nQUESTION: Do you have a roll of bills exposed in\nyour glove compartment?\nMS. FORSTER: At times I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You do?\nMS. FORSTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: You better be careful if you do.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FORSTER: I might also point out that at the\nactual trial, the expert who did testify for the State\nwith regard to the - whether or not this was an intent to\ndistribute - testified that without Mr. Pringle's\nconfession and this statement, he could not in fact say\nthat this was consistent with an intent to distribute\nbased solely -\nQUESTION: So it was at least possession. So\nwould you concede that a crime - in the officer's presence\nthere was evidence of the commission of a crime?\nMS. FORSTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Then - so the officer says, I know\nthat a crime has been committed. In the whole world there\nare only three possible people who could do it. What\ninstruction would you give to the officer on the scene who\nknows that a crime has been committed, there are three\npossible people, but he can't say which? Is it the answer\nthat he can make no arrest?\nMS. FORSTER: No, that's not the answer.\nQUESTION: What arrest can he make?\nMS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, in this case, the\nofficer could arrest Mr. Parlo, the driver of the\nautomobile, because I think it is universally accepted\nthat we can impute the driver owner of an automobile with\nthe knowledge that he knows what is in his car and he has\nexclusive control over that which is in his car. So the\nofficer here should have arrested Mr. Parlo.\nQUESTION: And no one else?\nMS. FORSTER: Your Honor, I would suggest that\nperhaps - I mean, and of course, this is not the issue\nbefore the Court, that perhaps because of Mr. Smith, the\nbackseat occupant, may also have been arrested given that\nthe nature of an armrest is not really a normal repository\nthat one would place personal items in -\nQUESTION: So maybe - definitely the driver,\nmaybe the backseat passenger -\nMS. FORSTER: Maybe Mr. Smith.\nQUESTION: - but not the one who in fact -\nMS. FORSTER: But definitely -\nQUESTION: - who in fact committed the crime.\nMS. FORSTER: Definitely not Mr. Pringle, but of\ncourse, if we're going to use Mr. Pringle's confession in\ndetermining in hindsight, we need not have -\nQUESTION: If this were - if this were a bus or a\ntavern or a theater or some of the examples, then it\ncertainly would unreasonable to assume that the front seat\npassenger could reach back to the last row of the theater.\nBut here, this was a small car. It isn't hard for\nsomebody in the front seat to turn around and push down\nthe armrest.\nMS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that\n- that perhaps it would not be difficult, given the\ncompact nature of this car. However, there was no\ntestimony that in fact that anyone saw Mr. Pringle do\nthat, number one, and number two -\nQUESTION: Well, that's because they - they\ndidn't have a buy committed in the presence of the officer\nat the scene.\nMS. FORSTER: Well, I - I understand that, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't know why that counts\nagainst -\nMS. FORSTER: Well, my second response would be\nthis, that I think that it would be highly unreasonable\nthat Mr. Smith, the backseat passenger, would allow Mr.\nPringle to turn around and store the drugs in the armrest\nright next to him.\nQUESTION: Why?\nQUESTION: Ms. Forster, the Maryland Court of\nAppeals, which ruled in your favor, says, during the\nsearch Officer Snyder seized $763 from the glove\ncompartment, so they are - they accepted that as a fact.\nMS. FORSTER: Your Honor, the Maryland - with all\ndue respect, the Maryland Court of Appeals made a mistake\nin this case because what they said in their opinion -\nQUESTION: Well, but no, we take the facts as the\nlower court found them. I mean, I don't think it will do\nto say that the court of appeals is wrong on the facts.\nMS. FORSTER: Your Honor, what the court of\nappeals incorrectly did in this case was - and they\ndropped a footnote to suggest that it was unclear to them\nwhether or not there was a separate motion to suppress\nhearing or whether there was a combined motion to suppress\ntrial proceeding. In fact, that's incorrect. There was a\nseparate motion to suppress hearing.\nQUESTION: But the - but they nonetheless say\nthat Office Snyder seized $763.\nMS. FORSTER: That's true, Your Honor, and for\npurposes of Mr. Pringle's position, the fact that that\nmoney is concealed, really it makes no difference the\namount. However, if the - as the petitioner and the U.S.\nSolicitor find the amount to be significant, I think we\nshould have a clearer record.\nQUESTION: Why - why did you say the driver, I\nmean, on your theory? I think it would be harder for the\ndriver who's driving along to put the bags back in the\nbackseat than it would be for the passengers.\nMS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Breyer, that assumes\nthat the driver did not put it there before he picked up\nhis passengers.\nQUESTION: Well, if he put it there before,\nwouldn't they all know it was there?\nMS. FORSTER: I don't think so, Your Honor. If\nit's - if it's sandwiched between the armrest as it's\npushed up against the seat, no, I don't.\nQUESTION: But the driver consented to have the\ncar searched, so one might think, my goodness, if he knew\nthere were drugs there, why did he say yes when he could\nhave said no?\nMS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I can tell you as\na criminal defense lawyer that defendants consent all the\ntime when they have a car full of drugs and they know the\ndrugs are there. It's not unusual and it -\nQUESTION: This is not like the - one of the\ncases that you relied on is the Di Re case. Your answer\nto me was, arrest the driver. There, the informer had\nfingered the driver, so the police knew that they had the\nright man when they arrested the driver. Here, it isn't\nat all like Di Re because the driver may or may not have\nbeen the right person.\nMS. FORSTER: Except that - how this case is\nsimilar to Di Re is that in Di Re this Court held that if\nthe act - the criminal activity, the ongoing criminal\nactivity, is not visible to the occupants, the mere\npresence is not enough on which to have probable cause to\narrest. And here we have concealed drugs and nothing more\nthan Mr. Pringle's presence in the front seat.\nQUESTION: But there - there's - there's another\ndifference. The drugs are not locked up in the trunk.\nThey are at a place where the backseat person could push\nit down. There wasn't a serious attempt to hide those\ndrugs securely.\nMS. FORSTER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree with\nthat. But however, that would only point more closely to\nMr. Smith, the backseat person sitting directly next to\nthe armrest, not to Mr. Pringle, the front seat passenger.\nQUESTION: Well, except if - if you accept the\nproposition that the - that there probably was a roll of\nbills visible in the glove compartment, Mr. Pringle was\nwithin easy reach, not even arm's reach of the rolled\nbills.\nMS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Souter, the - the\nproblem with that, of course, it's pure speculation, but\nwe don't even know if this glove compartment was locked or\nunlocked. What we know is that it was opened by the\ndriver at the time he was asked to retrieve his license\nand registration. Whether he had to unlock that glove\ncompartment is not clear at all for the record.\nQUESTION: Well, we - we don't know that and we\ndon't know whether the armrest had come down during the\ntime the backseat passenger was there. There are lots of\nthings at a probable cause stage that one does not know,\nbut the very fact - if - if we're going to talk - if we're\ngoing to find it significant that something is within\nreach of one of the passengers or not, I would have\nsupposed that for probable cause purposes, the fact that\nthe money was in reach was a relevant fact.\nMS. FORSTER: But, Your Honor, I - I think that\nif we want to speculate that perhaps then we could say\nthat that would be enough, but probable cause requires far\nmore than speculation. It requires a fair probability, at\nleast of complicity, and we simply don't have the facts in\nthis case that would support that fair probability with\nrespect to Mr. Pringle, because all the record shows is\nthat Mr. Pringle was present in a car where drugs were\nfound hidden.\nAnd if I may address the common enterprise\ntheory that both the petitioner and the U.S. Solicitor\nrelies on in this case, the problem with the common\nenterprise theory is that the cases that they cite in\nsupport of that involved ongoing criminal activity that\nwas conducted in plain view. You have the Ulster County\ncase, where the Court found that the weapons, one of which\nwas described as as large as a cannon, that was in plain\nview of all of the occupants of the car. And in the\nHoughton case - so it was reasonable in the Ulster County\ncase, or if that had in fact been the issue in that case,\nwhich it was not -\nQUESTION: Those I just think that - look, it\njust doesn't strike me as plausible that when you have\nthree people in a car, one of them would stuff some drugs\nbehind an armrest where they're very easy to find, unless\nhe thought the other two were in on it, I mean, unless you\nthought the other two at least didn't care, and if they\ndidn't care they're out there transporting the drugs with\nthem.\nMS. FORSTER: Well -\nQUESTION: So - so how - I don't even know, I\nmean, what I'm struggling for is, that seems like a\nreasonable inference so how - how do I know, I mean, I'm\nmaking this kind of inference. How do I know whether I\nshould or not?\nMS. FORSTER: Justice Breyer, the inference that\nthe backseat passenger may stuff the drugs in the armrest\n-\nQUESTION: Any of the three, I mean, any of them\nmight, and why would they? Why - you'd have to be crazy\nto be stuffing crack into a car like that without thinking\nyour friends are - have - don't give a damn at the very\nleast -\nMS. FORSTER: But certainly -\nQUESTION: - and probably are in on it.\nQUESTION: But certainly, I think that even if\nthey - he does that in the view of Mr. Pringle, that - so\nthat Mr. Pringle has knowledge that the drugs were shoved\nin the armrest - that certainly does not also go to the\nnext level, which is that Mr. Pringle possesses those\ndrugs. I may see one - a passenger -\nQUESTION: Would - would - would the - the\nofficer at that point then be able to say, ah, but, in any\ncase I could arrest the other two because they're\nharboring a felon? In other words, you said that you\ncould maybe arrest the ones who sitting next to the - the\nother, since the drugs are barely concealed?\nMS. FORSTER: Well, no, Your Honor, I - perhaps I\n- I was not clear.\nQUESTION: Here's what she's thinking, and there\nmight be a million different crimes. You say to the front\nseat passenger, everything's the same, but you say to the\nfront seat passenger, Mr. Front Seat Passenger, did you\nknow that there were drugs down there in the armrest? And\nhe says yes, and that's all he says. I would imagine he\ncould be arrested then, couldn't he?\nMS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, I -\nQUESTION: You couldn't arrest him then?\nMS. FORSTER: I don't think he could be arrested.\nQUESTION: For transporting the drugs or helping\nto transport them or being an accessory or doing\nsomething?\nMS. FORSTER: Well, certainly if he's the front\nseat passenger and not the driver he's - he's along for\nthe ride. He's not necessarily the person transporting -\nQUESTION: Well, he doesn't say anything. We\ndon't know anything about it. He just says, sure I knew\nthere were drugs back there, that's all.\nMS. FORSTER: Under those circumstances, Your\nHonor, I think you'd have a much closer case.\nQUESTION: No, no, but - but no, look, either\nthere is a crime of being in a car knowing that or there\nisn't. Is there or not? I don't know.\nMS. FORSTER: Well, the crime of possession\nrequires not just knowledge, but it also requires the\nintent to exercise dominion and control over the drug.\nQUESTION: All right, so - so you'd have to then\nmake an inference that a person who says, yes, I knew the\ndrugs where there, was also going to help later on.\nMS. FORSTER: Yes. That would -\nQUESTION: All right. But that's -\nMS. FORSTER: - there would have to be some\nreasonable inference -\nQUESTION: And you think that's not reasonable\neither?\nMS. FORSTER: I think it is not just on those\nfacts alone.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Am I right in assuming that the other\ntwo people in the car didn't testify at the suppression\nhearing?\nMS. FORSTER: No, they did not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Or at the trial?\nMS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, nor at the trial.\nOnly Officer Snyder testified at the motion to suppress\nhearing for the State.\nIf I may go back to the common enterprise\ntheory, as I said, the cases that the State and the U.S.\nSolicitor rely on here involved criminal activity\nconducted in plain view, and - which, from which an\nofficer could reasonably infer, I think, a common\nnefarious enterprise. We have a - less than one gram of\ncocaine in this case that is hidden, hidden, concealed in\nthe backseat armrest, and secondly, again, with respect to\nthis being a commercial quantity of drugs, there is simply\nnothing in the record that supports that. This was -\nQUESTION: Well, it was in separate little\npackets, right?\nMS. FORSTER: Yes, it was, but that, again -\nQUESTION: A kind that people would buy for a\nsingle dose?\nMS. FORSTER: That, again, your Honor, is not\ninconsistent with personal use, and certainly I should\nthink that if this police -\nQUESTION: Yeah, and one of their charges was\npossession, was it not? I mean, we're not dealing only\nwith intent to distribute but -\nMS. FORSTER: That - that is correct. The charge\nwas possession -\nQUESTION: Pure possession is what -\nMS. FORSTER: - and possession with intent.\nQUESTION: Well, to say it's not inconsistent\nwith personal use, I don't think gets your client totally\noff the hook, because something can be both consistent\nwith personal use and consistent with commercial intent.\nYou know, something can - you can infer both ways.\nMS. FORSTER: However, Justice Rehnquist, here\nthis amount is not indicative of an operation that\nrequires the participation of more than one person. This\nis an amount that, if it's for sale, it's for sale -\nQUESTION: But - but how about the combination of\nthat with the - with the $763 roll in the glove\ncompartment?\nMS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, I think then it\nwould still require speculation on the part of this police\nofficer to assume that one was connected to the other. I\nthink that the only common enterprise that reasonably\ncould have been inferred from the facts of this case is a\ncommon enterprise to go from one destination to another\nand nothing more than that, and given the concealed nature\nof the drugs in this case, the lack of any suspicious\nactivities on Mr. Pringle's part, and the lack of, I\nthink, any reasonable inference pointing to complicity\nthat he possessed the hidden drugs, the Maryland Court of\nAppeals in this case correctly held that there was no\nprobable cause to arrest Mr. Pringle, and this ruling\nshould be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Forster.\nMS. FORSTER: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bair, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BAIR: Thank you, Your Honor. I just wanted\nto first clarify any record inconsistencies or - or\nclarifications that might be in order. I believe that the\ncourt of appeals' opinion, which is at appendix page 3A to\nthe petition for cert, makes very clear that the court of\nappeals, the highest court in Maryland, construed the\nrecord as the officer seeing a large amount of money\nrolled up in the glove compartment, and it totaled $763.\nThat is clearly stated in the court of appeals' opinion,\nand I would direct the Court's attention to the trial\ntranscripts at pages 83 to 84. It is not in the joint\nappendix but it is in the record in the case, the trial\ntranscript pages 83 to 84 from the trial on April 10th of\n2000. The police officer who arrested respondent\ntestified at the trial that he saw a large roll of money\nin the glove compartment and that it totaled $763, so\nclearly there is record support and the court of appeals\nso found.\nWith regard to the glove compartment being\nclosed or locked, there's nothing in the record ever\nindicating that the glove compartment was locked. I think\nthe only natural inference from this record is that it was\nclosed at the time the car was stopped. The officer saw\nthe drug - excuse me - saw the money in the glove\ncompartment when the driver went to retrieve his vehicle\nregistration, and then after the officer obtained consent\nto search the car, he then opened the glove compartment\nagain and seized the money.\nI think it's ironic that the rule that is being\nsuggested by respondent is the bright line rule that the\ndriver should always be arrested. I think that's\nabsolutely inconsistent with this Court's Fourth Amendment\nlaw. In closing, unless the Court has any questions -\nQUESTION: Yeah, I do have one -\nMR. BAIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: - which is, I think she said, look,\nthere are three possible inferences. One is that the\npassenger had nothing to do with it, didn't know about it.\nTwo is, everybody knew about it but that's all. And\nthree, they knew about it and wanted to help sell the\ndrugs. All right. Now, she says, one plus two are so\ngreat that three isn't probable cause, but about, at least\ntwo.\nMR. BAIR: Your Honor, I think all - the nature\nof probable cause is that the officer is entitled to\naccept under the totality of the facts any of those\ninferences. I think any - any -\nQUESTION: Two - two isn't a crime, I mean, if\nthey just all knew about it?\nMR. BAIR: Under Maryland law, they have to have\nan intent to exercise control over the drugs. If they\nsimply knew about it, that would not be enough for a\nconviction, but I think -\nQUESTION: It has to be all three - it has to be\nthree is great enough, so despite one plus two - okay.\nMR. BAIR: Yes, but I think for probable cause\npurposes, clearly that would be sufficient. Thank you,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bair.\n"
