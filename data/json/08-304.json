        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 08-304, Graham County Soil\nand Water Conservation District v. The United States, ex\nrel. Wilson.\nMr. Browning.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether the word\n\"administrative\" as used in the public disclosure bar of\nthe False Claims Act includes State audits and reports\nor is limited to Federal sources.\nIf this Court were to hold that a relator\ncan simply copy a State report or a State criminal\nindictment and then proceed with a qui tam action, there\nwill be a proliferation of opportunistic qui tam actions\nbrought under this statute.\nSuch construction of the statute would have\na devastating effect upon States, local governments, and\nthe Federal fisc.\nMuch of the work of State government\ninvolves cooperative Federal and State programs. States\nhave been an effective partner in fighting against fraud\nand abuse with respect to those programs. For example,\nmany States have turned to computerized software to\nidentify irregularities in connection with Medicaid\nbillings. California has implemented a process of\nanalyzing both its Medicare and its Medicaid databases\nin order to identify doctors who bill in excess of\n24 hours in a given day.\nUnder the decision below, that investigatory\nwork can simply be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an\naction brought based upon that public report. The\nresult is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But under your proposal a\nState that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect,\nimmunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the\ninformation unusable by conducting a hearing.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, the\ngovernment certainly argues that it would result in\nState and local governments immunizing themselves from\nqui tam liability.\nWith respect to States, the Fourth Circuit's\ndecision expressly includes reports of the State\ngovernment. States, of course, are not liable under the\nqui tam provisions, as a result of this Court's decision\nin Vermont Department of Natural Resources v. United\nStates ex rel. Stevens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's also the\noriginal source, if -- if the relator is the original\nsource of the information.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat -- even if there is a State report that a -- that\na -- is in the public domain, a local government could\nstill be sued under that document, if -- in spite of\nthat document, by either the United States or a qui tam\nplaintiff that stands as an original source. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the\nargument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent\nprovisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and\nthis would -- if you would -- if you include State and\nlocal reports, that will shrink the availability?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, there is no\nquestion that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public\ndisclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 1943\nand 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui\ntam action, would be barred if it was based upon\ninformation that was available to the -- the Federal\nGovernment.\nCongress decided that that cut off too many\nqui tam actions, and as a result it reached a\ncompromise. Many members of Congress wanted to totally\neliminate the government knowledge bar. On the other\nhand, the United States Department of Justice at the\ntime was arguing that the existing bar should remain in\neffect as a result of abusive and frivolous qui tam\nactions and their concern with respect to that. So a\ncompromise was reached in which the bar was completely\nchanged. It was changed to allow for a -- for an\noriginal source to bring the qui tam action, essentially\na relief valve that addressed Congress's concerns with\nrespect to cases such as United States ex rel.\nWisconsin v. Dean.\nIt also in the 1986 amendments set out\nspecific sources of information and directly identified\nthe type of public information that a qui tam action can\nbe based upon. That list, of course, includes many\nsources that might or might not be readily available to\nthe United States Government. For example, it includes\nreports by a news media. A -- an obscure article in a\nweekly publication of limited circulation does not\nrealistically put the government on notice of a\nparticular fraud.\nThe same can be true -- said with regard to\nan action filed in Federal court, a private action\nbetween civil litigants based upon diversity\njurisdiction. If that -- if there is a summary judgment\nmotion filed in that case and there are a number of\ndepositions, one of which might indicate fraud, that are\nfiled in that summary judgment motion and the case\nsettles, that -- there will never be -- that summary\njudgment motion wouldn't be reviewed by the Federal\ndistrict court judge. But still, there is no question\nthat the filing of that document with the Federal court\nwould constitute a public disclosure under the first\nclause of the public disclosure bar.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would be a -- would it\nbe a civil hearing? A deposition -- you would consider\na deposition to be a civil hearing?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I am referring to\na deposition that is actually filed with the court in\nconnection with the summary judgment motion and the case\nthen settles. Generally, the -- the courts have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what provision\nwould it come under?\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Scalia, the phrase\n\"criminal, civil, or administrative hearing.\" The\ncourts have consistently read that word \"hearing\" as --\nas including all courts' proceedings, not simply the\nhearing itself, documents that are filed with the\nclerk's office --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Documents are -- documents\nare a hearing?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the -- if\nCongress had meant to limit that word \"hearing\" to\nliterally in-person oral arguments or in-person\ntestimony, it -- the result would be that a criminal\nindictment could be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an\naction brought based upon that.\nThat, of course, was this Court's decision\nin United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess. The -- it is\nclear from the congressional history that Congress\nwanted to change that result by -- so Congress used the\nword \"hearing\" that obviously meant more than -- than\nsimply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Meant more than hearing?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, and that's\nthe part of the problem, is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's an argument that\ndoesn't go very far with me. I mean, \"hearing\" means\nhearing.\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the -- the\nproblem is -- is that Congress really did not speak very\nclearly at all with respect to the False Claims Act, and\nso we're -- we're left with this mess of trying to\nfigure out exactly what Congress intended.\nThe phrase --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In your view, must an\nadministrative report be a report that is generated by\nsome government unit? Could it be a report by the\nadministration of a university, for example?\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Alito, the\nPetitioners would not read that phrase as -- that\nbroadly. When the Congress has used the word\n\"administrative hearing,\" that would appear to indicate\naction by the government.\nAnd, under any of the dictionary definitions\nof \"administration,\" clearly a State administrative\nproceeding, a State administrative report, would fall\nwithin the scope of the dictionary definition. We don't\nbelieve the Court needs to read that language as\nincluding private hospitals, private universities.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I'm not sure why.\nYou -- if -- unless \"administrative\" is informed by the\nother adjectives in that prepositional phrase, \"in a\ncongressional, administrative, or Government Accounting\nOffice,\" presumably GAO, \"report,\" it -- unless that is\nthe -- you know, unless it's informed by those other\nreferences, and that's why it has to be governmental,\nI'm not sure how you limit \"administrative\" to\ngovernmental reports.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, the public\ndisclosure bar uses the phrase \"administrative hearing\"\ntwice, and it's referring to Black's Law Dictionary. It\ndefines \"administrative hearing\" as, essentially, a\nhearing conducted by an administrative agency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say \"twice,\" you\nmean in the first clause that says \"in a criminal,\ncivil, or administrative hearing\"?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. And then in\nthe second clause it proceeds to use the phrase\n\"congressional, administrative, Government Accounting\nOffice hearing, audit, investigation, or report.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a redundancy\nthere if the statute means what you say it does; it says\n\"administrative hearing\" in both the first clause and\nthe second clause.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, there is a\nredundancy based upon Petitioner's construction of the\nstatute. But Congress was not particularly concerned\nabout redundancy in the False Claims Act. For example,\nagain it uses the phrase \"congressional, administrative,\nor GAO.\"\nGAO, of course, is a body that reports to\nCongress. Its head is appointed by the President. So\nunder any definition GAO would either be congressional\nor administrative, so there is a redundancy there.\nThere's also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think there would\nbe a good lawsuit as to whether \"congressional report\"\nincludes a GAO report. I think that's a lawsuit. I\ndon't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Justice Scalia, let me\nalso point out that there is a redundancy in connection\nwith the use of \"audit, report, or investigation.\"\nEssentially, Congress is using the same word to mean\nessentially the same thing in that clause as well.\nBut yes, our reading does result in a\nredundancy in the statute. Of course, the government\nreads this entire clause as being limited to Federal\nproceedings. They would urge a redundancy in the\nstatute as well. But what's more important is this\nCourt has consistently said that it will not read the\nsame phrase as having a different meaning in the same\nsentence.\nYes, Congress has created a redundancy, but\nthat is no more egregious than the fact that it used the\nphrase \"Government Accounting Office\" to refer to what\nwas clearly the General Accounting Office.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, that argument\ndoes not scare the government. I think the government\nwould like to read \"administrative hearing\" in the\nfirst -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federal\nadministrative hearing as well.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Scalia. That is\ntheir argument today. Of course, just 11 months ago in\nUnited States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic, the\ngovernment argued in the Sixth Circuit that a qui tam\naction should be dismissed based upon a State court\ncomplaint. They convinced the Sixth Circuit to accept\nthat position and dismissed that complaint on January 14\nof this year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that was on -- on the\nbasis of the first, the first phrase rather than the\nsecond?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, based upon\nthe first clause of the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this particular audit\nreport we are talking about, this is the audit report\nwas done by an independent accountant? Is that --\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. There are\ntwo audit reports -- I'm sorry, there are two reports.\nThe key one is the report that identifies or asserts\nthat this work at issue should have been sent out by\nbid. That was prepared by an accounting firm for Graham\nCounty, North Carolina, the same auditor that was\nengaged by the county to comply with the Single Audit\nAct --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that audit\non file with the Department of Agriculture?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I would have to\ngo beyond the record, but yes, we have conducted a --\nsubmitted a Public Information Act request, and\nessentially a week after the document was transmitted to\nGraham County it was transmitted to the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The arguments in this case,\nmy initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I\ncan remember, really. For each one, there is a\ncounterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air.\nSo if -- since we have to decide it, it\nshould -- should I take this into account: That if the\nRespondents are right, you are absolutely correct that\nthere will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards\nat the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have\nthem. No question. They front-run the government.\nThey read the report, run in court fast, before it's in\nthe newspaper.\nBut if you are right, then they are going to\nhave to assign people to look at these obscure\nadministrative reports that didn't even get in the\nnewspaper. So they want to do that, they don't have\npeople to do it, and they say these people are\nperforming a service of sorts by reading them, the\nreports, for them and telling them about it. And there\nit is, balanced.\nBut they are the ones who suffer. You see,\nthey suffer both ways. They suffer if people don't tell\nthem; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting\nunjustified rewards because the money comes from the\nFederal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent. So if\nthey're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special\nattention to their views as to how the balance works\nout?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, Justice\nBreyer, first of all, the government hasn't been\nconsistent. As we pointed out in United States ex rel.\nPoteet, they have taken the exact opposite position with\nregard to clause 1 in the first circuit.\nBut the real issue here and what should\nconcern the Court is the fact that there will be a\ntremendous number of opportunistic qui tam plaintiffs\nthat arise. If someone can simply go to an ongoing\nState or local government investigation, copy it, and\nbring it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As you can tell, I have\ntaken that point in.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So my question wasn't that.\nMy question was, Should I or should I not give them a\nlittle expertise weight on the grounds that they are the\nones who know it best, that they are the victims?\nMR. BROWNING: Well, I would suggest that\nthe weight that should be given is to the partners of\nthe Federal government, States and local governments\nthat are in the trenches administering these programs,\nthat will have tremendous difficulty if there is a rash\nof qui tam actions that are brought that disrupt ongoing\nMedicaid and other investigations.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How will that happen?\nMeaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation\nis occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal\nor State law to require the disclose of ongoing\ninvestigative materials?\nI don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied\nthem -- but the ones that I am familiar with never\npermit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information\nAct-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of\nongoing investigative material. So I am a little bit\nconfused by how that would happen.\nMR. BROWNING: Justice Sotomayor, there are\ngoing to be some exceptions to many States' Public\nInformation Act requests, things such as attorney-client\ncommunications, in some cases criminal investigations.\nBut for most States there will not be any sort of\nprohibition against a plaintiff's attorney filing a\nPublic Information Act request saying, print out -- give\nus a copy of all printouts that show disparities and\nirregularities with regard to Medicaid billings.\nMoreover, most States are -- by law are\nrequired to receive complaints concerning the State's\nMedicaid program. Those are generally processed by the\nState's system integrity program. And those reports are\ngoing to be readily available to Public Information Act\nrequests.\nEssentially, what this Court should be\nworried about are State employees who know where the\ndocuments can be located. You can simply copy the\ndocument, bring a qui tam action, and produce a windfall\nfor yourself, potentially disrupting the State\ninvestigation. And if Congress really wanted to do\nthat, if they wanted to create this rash of ill-advised\nqui tam actions, this flood that's about to fall upon\nthe States, Congress should have written a little bit\nmore clearly before doing so. It isn't consistent with\nthe language of the statute or with congressional\nintent.\nThroughout the legislative history it is\nclear that what Congress was intending to do was to have\naccess to true insiders, the whistleblowers, to obtain\ninformation that would be confidential, that would not\notherwise be available to the Federal Government.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But Congress obviously\nwanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was\nthe one that you are announcing then it should have just\npermitted original sources to sue. But that's not the\nchoice it made. It broadened the scope of qui tam\nactions to include more sources or more reward for\nindividuals who don't have original information.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, it -- it\nadded the original source provision, and it identified\ncertainly sources of information and said, you cannot\nbring an action based upon those specific sources.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. BROWNING: Those include --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question:\nIs the fact that they've included the news media\nconsistent with your view?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That seems to be a much\nmore open source of information than you're raising.\nMR. BROWNING: Exactly. The government\nargues that the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal,\nthe public disclosure bar should therefore be read as\nexclusively Federal. But the existence of this category\nof news media indicates that Congress did not intend the\npublic disclosure bar to be exclusively Federal sources.\nThere -- there -- under the government's\ntheory that all of this fall -- the entire public\ndisclosure bar should be read as limited to Federal\nsources, the only news media that would be able to -- to\nfall within the scope of the public disclosure bar would\nbe the Voice of America, which is the only Federal news\nmedia currently in existence, to my knowledge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Stars and Stripes, maybe.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you,\nJustice Scalia.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's not\nterribly persuasive. In the statute there are separate\nprovisions, they talk about disclosures \"in criminal,\ncivil or administrative hearings,\" \"in a congressional\nadministrative or Government Accounting Office report,\nor from the news media.\" Simply because you want to\nlimit \"administrative\" or not limit \"administrative\"\ndoes not mean that the other side's view requires news\nmedia to be modified by \"Federal.\"\nMR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, two points\nI would like to make in response is: First, these\nclauses -- and there are three clauses, the first one\nbeginning with \"in\" and the third one beginning with\n\"from\" -- they do not serve different purposes. Rather,\nthey serve to identify the sources that Congress did not\nwant to give rise to a qui tam action. So this list has\nto be read as a whole.\nThe second point I would like to make is\nthroughout --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We should stop calling them\nclauses. They are really phrases.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.\nWith respect to these three phrases, the --\nthroughout the legislative history, the year and a half\nthat the False Claims Act was being debated, there were\nonly two clauses that began with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Phrases.\nMR. BROWNING: -- the preposition \"in\" --\nphrases.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BROWNING: -- that began with the\npreposition \"in\" and then \"from\" in connection with\n\"news media.\" It was only on October 3, 1986, that\nthe -- when it was -- the provision was finally enacted\nby the Senate, that this second \"in\" was added before\nthe second clause.\nSo, Congress undoubtedly did not intend to\nmake this 11th-hour change and have some substantive\nchange to the statute. Rather, it should best be read\nas a last-minute insert to make the clause, the three\nclauses as a whole, read and flow much better than they\ndid prior to that time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me just as a\npractical matter, suppose -- suppose the county says,\nyou know, we found out that we were defrauded by this\ncontractor, and it sues the contractor. But its suit\ndoesn't cover really all of the damages, only half of\nit. Can a qui tam action then be commenced for the\nportion that the county isn't seeking? I mean, how does\nthat work?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, if there has been\na public disclosure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which there would be if\nthere's a complaint filed by the county --\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- against the contractor.\nMR. BROWNING: Essentially what the lower\ncourts have done is they would allowed a qui tam action\nto go with regard to a completely different claim. But\nif it were simply the fact that the public disclosure\ncovered a portion of the time period but not all of\nit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Depends on the identity of\nthe claim?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and suppose in\ntheir race to the courthouse, the qui tam plaintiff\nfiles on Monday and the county files on Tuesday?\nMR. BROWNING: Under -- under that scenario,\nif the qui tam action is filed before the public\ndisclosure, then the qui tam action would not be bourne.\n-\nIf there are no further questions, I'd\nlike --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I, just one -- one\nquick question. I -- I -- I just want to be sure I\nunderstood. Do you draw any distinction between the\npreposition \"in\" and the preposition \"from\"?\nMR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor. I think it\nis -- as Justice Alito pointed out when he served on the\nThird Circuit, that some of these prepositions are very\nawkward indeed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Part of the random nature\nof the whole provision, right?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\nMr. Hurt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. HURT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HURT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe decision of the Fourth Circuit is\ncorrect because the text of the False Claims Act compels\nthe result, and the purpose -- and also the purposes of\nthe 1986 amendments to the Act. As the Fourth Circuit\nnoted, Congress grouped the disclosure sources in\nparagraph (a) of the public disclosure bar into three\ndistinct categories. In CATEGORY 2, the term\n\"administrative\" which is at issue here is sandwiched\nbetween the terms \"congressional\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's begin at the\nbeginning, and that is with the first phrase with the,\nwhat is it, \"civil, criminal, administrative hearing.\"\nDo you as the government -- do you agree with the\ngovernment that you have to insert \"Federal\" there, too?\nOr does that phrase --\nMR. HURT: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- include States?\nMR. HURT: No, the -- the text of category 2\ncompels the result here, although we do believe that the\nbetter view of category 1 is that it is also Federal as\nwell, and the context -- the overall context --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose it\nisn't? Suppose the general \"civil, criminal,\nadministrative\" is read to mean -- include State. Why\nshouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin\nphrases, be read in pari materia?\nMR. HURT: Because each of those categories\nis distinct, not only grammatically, but as far as\nfunction. The first category is clearly adjudicative in\nnature. The second is non-adjudicative. And the third\ncategory is -- is news media and stands on its own.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why should we read\nthe second category back to alter the meaning of the\nfirst, rather than reading the first phrase forward to\nalter the meaning of the second? It -- it is absolutely\nclear when you read this, \"in a criminal, civil, or\nadministrative hearing\"; there is no limitation to\nFederal on that. And you acknowledge that the criminal\nand civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal\nproceedings, right? So when you read that phrase,\n\"administrative\" simply means, obviously means State\nadministrative.\nNow, why shouldn't I read that forward and\nsay, well, since it means State there, it must mean\nState in the next one, in a congressional,\nadministrative, or GAO report.\nMR. HURT: The argument for category 2 is\nless compelling, we agree. The argument for category 1\nis most compelling because these categories are distinct\nand should be looked at as separate units for that\npurpose. You have category 2 as non-adjudicative, and\ncategory 1 is adjudicative. And so you have -- you have\ndistinction there.\nIf you were looking at the three categories\nand, for instance, you don't say category 3 and say\ncategory 3 is nongovernmental, so therefore we should\nconstrue category 2 to include private administrative\nreports.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question is, what sense\ndoes that make? I mean -- and I thought you said that\nthe category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil\nor administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does\nnot apply to State proceedings in your view. You said\nthat was the better view.\nMR. HURT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the state of the law\non that? I thought it was virtually -- what is the\nstate of the law?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that just as to\nadministrative. Don't you acknowledge that the criminal\nand civil apply to State criminal and civil?\nMR. HURT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want the whole thing to\nbe just Federal?\nMR. HURT: No, we think the better view is\nthat the whole category is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The whole category?\nMR. HURT: -- exclusively Federal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think you'd have to say\nthat. But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?\nMR. HURT: The -- the court of appeals have\nbasically gone the other way, but they have looked at it\nin a very superficial matter and have not really\ndirectly addressed the issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are we supposed to do?\nI mean, to me it makes no sense. We are only talking\nabout things that don't get into the newspapers. So --\nand the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of\nthis would be, look, we don't have people to go send\naround to every -- read every State report. We just\ndon't have that personnel. So we rely on these\nwhistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified. I\nwould think the same thing would be absolutely true of\nState criminal proceedings that don't get into the\nnewspaper. There are probably 50 -- several\nthousands -- thousands and thousands.\nSo how to read these differently is a\nproblem for me. And I think that's on your side of it.\nBut we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to\nme is the -- is the question here.\nMR. HURT: Well, the False Claims Act in\nsections, the pertinent sections 3729 and 3730, refers\nto the Federal Government many times but never with the\nmodifier \"Federal.\" They do it through context. And in\nfact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any history, which\nI pay attention to -- is there any legislative history\nor anything else that you can point to, to me that's\nimportant, showing that that first criminal hearing\nmeans just Federal?\nMR. HURT: Yes, the -- the legislative\nhistory shows throughout -- beginning with the House and\nSenate bills and going forward that these -- the earlier\nversion shows these were exclusively Federal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they meant criminal\nhearing. Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal\nhearing, not State.\nMR. HURT: Exactly, and you have references\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say \"exactly.\" I was\nlooking for the backup for that.\nMR. HURT: Yes. The legislative history is\nclear on that point, and in fact if you look at the\nSenate bill that was passed August 11, you have the\nfinal version of paragraph (A), and then you -- which\nwas enacted in law, and paragraph (B) was somewhat\ndifferent, but it had the phrase \"government or news\nmedia,\" \"disclosures to government or news media.\" It's\nclearly referencing back to paragraph (A) and\ncategorizing those sources as either sources of capital\n\"G\" government, the Federal Government, or the news\nmedia.\nAnd the changes -- the subsequent changes to\nparagraph (B) give no indication that Congress's\nbackground understanding of that changed. There is no\nindication of that. And of course you have the Senate\nsponsors of the bill making the same statements that\nthis was clearly Federal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- what was the\nreason for that be, given that there are so many joint\nFederal-State grant programs, like the one that's\ninvolved here? Why wouldn't a State report be as much\nof a public disclosure as a Federal report? I mean, we\nare told that this particular report was filed with the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture.\nMR. HURT: Because it gives no -- a report\nproduced by a State or a local government -- and again,\ntheir argument is not just State but every little local\nentity producing these reports fall under the\ncategory 2, according to them. Simply the fact that a\nlocal or State official might be producing this report\ngives no indication that the Federal Government is\nfocusing on it or looking at it. And in fact --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think the Federal\nGovernment is focusing on everything that is disclosed\nin every civil proceeding that occurs in Federal court?\nMR. HURT: No, but Congress was selecting\ngeneral categories and as a general category the Federal\nproceedings they thought were more likely to put the\ngovernment on notice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: News media, they are likely\nto be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?\nMR. HURT: Well, I think that as a general\ncategory it was reasonable for Congress to assume that\nthe news media disclosures would be disseminated in\ngeneral to the general public and would put pressure on\nthe government to take action, and the government would\npay attention to that in general.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they could have\nsaid \"national news media.\" It didn't say \"national\nnews media.\" It said \"news media.\"\nMR. HURT: It said \"news media.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It includes a local radio\nstation, a local community newspaper, right? All of\nthat is included.\nMR. HURT: Congress was drawing the lines --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And yet, State proceedings,\nwhich are excluded, right?\nMR. HURT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even state supreme court\ncases and so forth. It seems strange to me.\nMR. HURT: Well, under, under -- this Court\nrecognized in Cook County that the 1986 amendments\nabolished the government knowledge rule and allowed the\nqui tam relators to bring cases even where the\ngovernment, Federal Government, had possession of\ninformation about the fraud.\nWhat we are doing here is not even -- we are\nnot even sure the government has possession of these\nreports. A lot of these reports are just sitting in\nfile cabinets all around the country in these little\nadministrative office buildings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hurt, let me just give\nyou what's really troubling me about this case. You\nhave two citizens of a small town. One of them goes to\nthe hearing and gets all this information, the other one\ndoesn't go to the hearing and reads about it in the\nnewspaper. The latter is a permissible plaintiff, the\nformer is not; is that correct?\nMR. HURT: Correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that make any sense?\nMR. HURT: It does, because Congress drew\nit -- picked it as a general category. They were\nthinking probably most likely The New York Times or\nnewspapers that have actual investigative reporting\nresources, and that was what they had in mind.\nHere you have a whole --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't show that it\nmakes sense. It just shows that Congress wasn't\nthinking clearly. There's as difference between the\ntwo.\nMR. HURT: One of the huge problems with\nPetitioners' position is it's going to sweep into\ncategory 2 an enormous number of reports and audits that\nthe Federal Government is likely to never see, never\ncome across, and you need these concerned citizens to\ngo -- you want the citizens to go and look at these.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, are you\nsure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched\nbetween two Federal descriptions? Are you sure\n\"congressional\" is limited to Federal Congress? The\nfirst definition in Black's Dictionary is \"a formal\nmeeting of delegates.\" And I don't know -- maybe I\nshould -- I don't know if all 50 States refer to their\nlegislature by some term other than \"Congress.\"\nMR. HURT: The Petitioners have not pointed\nto an example of a State congress. I think it's\ngenerally conceded that that would be Federal. And\nalso, when you look at GAO, that's clearly a Federal\nentity there as well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's very first question. I want you to\nassume that in category 1 it means State or Federal.\nMaybe you disagree, maybe you don't. I want you to\nassume that. If we assume that, does it make any sense\nto confine category 2 to Federal only?\nMR. HURT: Yes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the\npractical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I\nwant to know the practical rationale for that, the\npractical reasons why that should make sense.\nMR. HURT: Because reports and audits are\njust a totally -- a category that is much -- many\nmagnitudes greater than the number of criminal, civil,\nand administrative hearings. You are going to have\nmillions of documents all over this country in file\ncabinets that are generated by local and State\ngovernments that there is no possibility the vast\nmajority of those would ever come across the attention\nof the Federal Government. And so you want concerned\ncitizens to be looking through, monitoring their local\ngovernments, digging up these reports and bringing\nlawsuits based on those. The Federal Government's\nsimply not going to do it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which decision of ours do\nyou think would prompt Congress to go back and do this\nright? I mean, do you think that finding the way the\ngovernment wants us to find will produce a revision of\nthis really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do\nyou think that finding for the other side, giving the\ngovernment some incentive to get this fixed, would\nlikely produce a proper amendment? What do you think?\nI think the latter, to tell you the truth.\nMR. HURT: Well, unfortunately we have to\ndeal with the statute as it is. And, you know, the --\nour position uses all the clues in the statute to\nconstrue it. The other side construes it in a crude\nmanner and says, let's treat it like a laundry list,\nlet's not use any of the grammatical clues in construing\nthis language, and also let's construe it in a way that\nignores what Congress did in 1986, which was to abolish\nthe government knowledge part. This is a reimposition\nof that bar.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that the second\nphrase said \"in a congressional, news media, or GAO\nreport.\" Would you read \"news media\" to be\ngovernmental?\nMR. HURT: No, I would not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween that and the way it's phrased now?\nMR. HURT: Because it is -- Congress did put\nit in a separate category, so --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, no. Right now we have\n\"in a congressional, administrative, or Government\nAccounting Office report.\" And you say you have to read\n\"administrative\" in light of \"congressional\" and \"GAO.\"\nBut what if it said \"in a congressional, news media, or\nGovernment Accounting Office report\"?\nMR. HURT: I think that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't you make the\nsame argument with relation to \"news media\"?\nMR. HURT: I think the contextual clues\nwould be less compelling there in that situation, and\nyou would have --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that?\nMR. HURT: Because you would have a category\nthat would have a mixture of exclusively Federal and\nnonfederal. Here you have a category that you can't\nconstrue consistently as exclusively Federal, given the\ncontextual clues in there. So as it is drafted now, if\nyou look at all the clues you do have distinct\ncategories that can be construed each on its own merits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This audit report is\nrequired by Federal law, isn't it?\nMR. HURT: Yes, as are many reports,\nMedicaid reports by private recipients, today. This\nreport was only done because the local government was a\nrecipient of Federal money, no different from any\nprivate recipient, a not-for-profit. So there was no\nreal distinction there. It was not really a\ngovernmental report, in the truest sense of the word, as\nit should be construed or regarded for purposes of the\npublic disclosure bar.\nAnd that's -- that shows the real -- one of\nthe real problems of going down to the -- to the local\nand State level. You get all of these problems where\nthe recipient is generating the reports rather than the\n-- the administrator versus the recipient. You get all\nthose problems going down to this level, the local and\nState governments, and it shows the real problem with\nthat.\nAgain, this is the -- the overall statute is\nFederal, it's to recover the Federal Government's money.\nThe statute has a strict dichotomy between the Federal\nGovernment and everyone else. If the States or local\ngovernments are going to be qui tam relators, they bring\nit as a private person. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAs I think the discussion this morning\nillustrates, the Federal nature of the second category,\nthe phrase that is directly at issue in this case, is\nself-evident from the text. The terms congressional and\nGAO are Federal and under the doctrine or canon of\nconstruction noscitur a sociis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me go back to the\nother Latin phrase. If you begin at the beginning and\nyou begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say\nis modified by Federal, \"civil, criminal or\nadministrative proceeding,\" why shouldn't that drive the\nstatute, what's in the first phrase?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\n-- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that\nthat's a better interpretation of the first clause, but\nI will take it as the premise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's a lot hard to\nsay you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi --\nmeans Federal civil, criminal and administrative\nhearings.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- it may indeed\nbe harder to do that. We think that it is warranted in\nlight of the policy that motivated Congress and in light\nof other references to Federal administrative, civil and\ncriminal hearings in the statute. But even if those\nreasons which we think justify limiting the first\ncategory to Federal proceedings -- the Court were to\ndisagree with that, that would not justify disregarding\nthe clear indications of the Federal limitations on the\nsecond clause. And there is no policy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I didn't\nmean to interrupt. Clear limitations, you really have\nonly one, right? I mean you have no argument construing\nadministrative in a Federal way other than it is\nsandwiched between two other Federal --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\nthink that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at\nthe very beginning of the argument illustrated, the\nliteral language of the word administrative would\nencompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or\nuniversities as well. Now Petitioner es hewed that\ninterpretation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we would just\n-- we would just take the sections from your brief today\nand say well no, you have got to read it in the context\nin which it appears and this is all Federal, which means\nit's all governmental.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's\nright, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular\nnature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government.\nAs is the Court's decision in Cook County made clear,\nmunicipal governmental entities are with respect to the\nFalse Claims Act the same as private corporations. The\n-- the Court recognized that municipalities are the\nrecipients of many Federal dollars. In that case the\nlocal governmental entity whose conduct is at issue was\na county hospital. And -- and county hospitals receive\nfunds under the same programs that private hospitals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just want to get your\nexpertise on this, because you have probably read the\nlegislative history of the 1986 amendment. All right,\nam I right in thinking this? If I go back and read\nit -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this\nentire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or\nconference, does the word State appear in any relevant\ncontext?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not right. Okay. So\nwhen it appears --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I guess it\ndepends on what you mean by the relevant context.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm -- the relevant\ncontext has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in\nrespect to the first clause, \"criminal, civil, or\nadministrative proceeding.\" Is there any indication\nthat those were meant to apply -- any indication that\nthose were meant to apply to State as opposed to\nuniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative\nproceedings?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor, it\nis -- it is clear from the legislative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Clear from the\nrecord -- clear that --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That it was Federal\nproceedings that Congress had in mind. And -- and if\nyou would take --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the word hearing --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If you would look\non page 19 of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you be more specific\nwhen you say that Congress had in mind? Just so I know\nwhat you are talking about?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I'm sorry, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The committee that reported\nthe bill.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I'm -- that's\nright. That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In both houses or just one\nhouse?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, we have the\n-- the committee report and the bill that was recorded\nby the House which states specifically at that point,\nthe public disclosure bar referenced information which\nthe Government, capital G, disclosed the basis of\nallegations in a prior administrative civil proceeding.\nThat was the House.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The House.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, North\nCarolina has got a government, too.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: North Carolina has a\ngovernment, too.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as we note,\nYour Honor, the statute uses the term \"Government\" with\na capital G throughout to refer to the Federal\nGovernment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same rule for\nCongress?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same rule for\ncongressional?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, congressional\n-- the -- the term congressional is frequently used\nwithout a capital, but State legislatures are not\nreferred to as congresses. And that is one of the\nanomalies that petitioners simply cannot explain: why\nCongress would have thought that an administrative\nreport issued by a local school board should give rise\nto the bar, but a report or a hearing conducted by a\nState legislature would not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an explanation\nfor it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what\nwas it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was\ngenerating reports, audits, as distinguished from\nadministrative agencies.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well -- well, Your\nHonor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that\nprograms are administered by the executive branch more\nthan the legislative branch, but that is no reason to\nthink that Congress would have meant to exclude, if\nthose State legislatures did conduct a hearing with\nrespect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public\ndisclosure. The reason that Congress didn't include\nState legislative reports is because it didn't include\nState reports at all. It was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well that -- that doesn't\nfollow like the night the day. It could be, as it was\nexplained, they didn't include State legislatures\nbecause they didn't think they would be generating\nrelevant material.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\n-- I think that it is more likely as -- as the\ndevelopment and progress of the clause reflects, that\nCongress was focused on what does the government know\nand what does the disclosure show about the whether the\ngovernment is already or is likely to focus on the\nfraud.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the Justice Department\nseeking to get this -- this piece of -- of statutory\ntext clarified? I mean, you do have some operation over\nthere that proposes to Congress amendments of those\nprovisions that are not working out well. Is there --\nis there any effort to get this clarified?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There -- I -- there\nare currently under consideration bills or, and as I\nunderstand it, they are not, there are other bills that\nare in contemplation that would revise the language of\nthe statute, but -- but would not necessarily focus on\nthis. There are a number of other issues connected --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could it make it worse?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I don't know.\nBut of course --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the question was\nhas the Department of Justice, recognizing that there's\na circuit split this very question recommended that\nCongress amend the statute in this particular --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I don't\nbelieve that as of yet the department has taken a\nspecific position on -- on the legislation that is\ncontemplated in this particular ambiguity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is one ambiguity\nwhether this clause, the first -- what we call first and\nsecond refers to State as well as Federal. If the\ndebate took place in a context where everyone's just\nthinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put\nin the word Federal. They don't think of everything.\nAll right. Now, that's my question.\nYou started with the House. The House to me\ndoes think just of Federal. The Senate's ambiguous on\nthat point --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Senate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and the conference is\nyet more ambiguous on that point. So is there\nanything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate\nversions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they\ndid actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's\nsort of mixed up? Or am I going to see that that\ncontext there is Federal?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The context is --\nis Federal. References to States in connection with the\nact that Congress has thought about it are treating\nStates like other private qui tam relators.\nThey Petitioner referred to the Dean case,\nand, in fact, that was something that the -- the\nlegislative history refers to, but what was offensive\nabout the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin\nhad been the original source of the information, but had\nbeen barred because it had provided that information to\nthe government.\nAnd, under the government knowledge bar,\nthey had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have\nbeen taken care of under the original source provision,\nbut it doesn't reflect a view that States have a\nparticular distinctive role.\nIn fact, as this Court's decision in Cook\nCounty reflects, municipalities are treated just like\nany private corporation for purposes of the act. They\ncan be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam\nrelators, but there is no reason to construe the statute\nin a way that would allow a local government,\ntechnically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by\ndisclosing the facts that would be the underlying\ninformation support of the fraud claim in, perhaps, a\nreport that was intended to -- to whitewash the\nsituation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that the --\nwhen a -- when State employees want to immunize\nthemselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we\nwill disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick\nit up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\nthink it's important to note that, in order to be a\npublic disclosure -- the second category at the very\nleast -- all that needs to have happened is that\ninformation be disclosed to -- to one additional person.\nThat -- and that makes a lot of sense when\nwe are talking about disclosures of the government --\nFederal government's own reports because, if the Federal\ngovernment is already investigating and pursuing the\nfraud, one other person that finds out about it and then\nfiles a qui tam action on the basis of the government's\nown effort is precisely the situation that Congress\nsought to preclude.\nBut it doesn't make any senses when we are\ntalking about a disclosure to an individual by a State\nor local --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's lots of\ndisclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal\nreports that the government isn't pursuing.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, we think that\nthe -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types\nof reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced\nin the clause are the type that would evidence that the\ngovernment is pursuing them.\nAnd -- but where a State -- perhaps a local\nschool board discloses facts that might give rise to an\nallegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only\none or two members of the public in attendance, there is\nno reason to think that that information is going to be\nbrought to the Federal government's attention.\nThe purpose of the bar is to balance --\nCongress was seeking to balance two rules. One is to\nencourage qui tam relators to bring information and\nbring suit where the information was unlikely to be\nsomething that the government -- Federal government was\nfocusing on.\nWhere the Federal government was able to\nprotect itself and bring this suit on its own, then\nthere's no reason for the Federal government to have to\nshare its recovery.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why can't it -- why\ncan't it protect itself if these reports are in its\npossession? How are they any more in the -- or less in\nthe government's possession than articles in the news\nmedia, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative\nhearings?\nYou, yourself, make it very clear that the\ngovernment -- it isn't keeping track of all of those\nother sources.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nPetitioners' reference to this audit being in the\npossession of the government -- it's happenstance that\nthis particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was\nsent to the Federal government official.\nBut the vast majority of State and local\ngovernmental investigations, audits, and reports, are\nnot going to be given to the Federal government, and\neven though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act,\nwhich is only a very narrow subset of audits that States\nor local governments perform -- do not actually disclose\nthe allegations of the fraud.\nIn order to get to the actual information of\nthe fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be\nbrought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency.\nUsually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the\nmost money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a\ndifferent Federal program, so it has to be brought to\nthe attention of the program whose interests are\nactually at stake.\nThey have to go beyond the report that is --\nthat is publicly available in the clearinghouse website,\nwhich tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying\nreport which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all\nPetitioners say is that the working papers of the\nauditor are available to the government, not even in the\ngovernment's possession, they are available to the\ngovernment if it requests it.\nThe government has to drill down many levels\nbefore it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that argument\nsuggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this\nissue, even assuming that the State administrative\nreports are included in the bar?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No -- no, Your\nHonor, I don't think so.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, aren't you arguing\nthat what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to\nshow the fraud? That's not your argument?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No -- again, this\nreport here did have information that was indicative of\nfraud, and this report --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In which way?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which way? All it said\nwas that this person wasn't chosen by bidding. But\naren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There -- there were\nmultiple allegations. One of the allegations underlying\nthe relator's claim is that the government -- the county\ncertified that certain procedures were followed that\nwould have included a requirement that it be bid out,\nand that it was not.\nAnother was that certain work was paid for\nor billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed\nwell, so there were -- there were different allegations,\nand where that would be disclosed to a single person,\nthat would constitute a public disclosure, at least with\nrespect to Federal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the Attorney\nGeneral can always bring suit, right? I mean, all we\nare arguing about is whether this information that is in\nthe in the State and local thing could be the basis of a\nqui tam suit.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But only if we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the government finds out\nabout it, the Attorney General could always bring suit,\nright?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And what is at\nissue here is whether the Federal government is ever\ngoing to learn of the fraud.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Browning, you have six minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BROWNING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Breyer, if I could first turn to\nyour comments or your questions about legislative\nhistory; here, I think the legislative history tells us\nvery little because of the many changes in the Senate\nversion and the House version, and unfortunately, there\nwas not a conference committee report, so we won't know\nthe nature of the compromise.\nAt most, the legislative history helps us to\nshow what Congress was generally concerned about, and\nthroughout the original committee, the Senate and House\nreport, there is a concern about qui tam actions based\nupon public information.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I agree with you about\nthat. I think it's the silence, though, that might cut\nagainst you.\nMR. BROWNING: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it's --\nit's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that\ncuts against you is because of this sorting of the\ncontext where they are focusing on Federal.\nAnd, if everybody is working in that\ncontext, then nothing said about State means they are\njust assuming it's all applying to Federal.\nNow, what I'm looking for, you might be able\nto put your finger on, is something that shows that my\nlast statement is not right.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Breyer, that the\ngovernment assumes and repeats throughout its brief that\nthe False Claims Act is exclusively Federal in nature;\ntherefore, you read all of its terms as essentially\nbeing -- being Federal.\nThat, of course, does not answer what\nCongress intended with the public disclosure bar --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When we say everybody's\nworking in a certain context, how -- how many people is\neverybody? What percentage of the House and of the\nSenate were involved in these committees that were\ndrafting these bills and that issued the committee\nreport?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Scalia, your\npoint is well-taken, that this would only be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think in the -- it was --\nit probably came out in governmental affairs in the\nSenate, which I think had 17 members at the time.\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nContinuing with your -- your question, if I\ncould, Justice Breyer, that there is nothing to indicate\nthat the public disclosure bar should be exclusively\nFederal.\nIt, of course, includes news media, which is\nnot Federal. It also includes criminal, civil, or\nadministrative hearings. But moreover, there are many\naspects of the False Claims Act that are not exclusively\nFederal in nature.\nThe very change that we are talking about --\nthe -- the change to the public disclosure bar was a\nresult of a push by the National Association of Attorney\nGenerals to actually change the public disclosure bar to\nmake sure that States could bring qui tam actions.\nThat is why the public disclosure bar\nincludes an original source provision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To -- to follow up,\nI think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked\nearlier. Do you have any tie-breaker on your side?\nI mean, if we do decide the arguments are\npretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the\nFederal government is both the beneficiary and the loser\nin the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a\npercentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them\nstrike the balance.\nWhat argument do you have on your side?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, again, that our\nconcern from the perspective of the States -- and it's a\nconcern shared by local governments -- is the reading\nthat Respondents advocate will produce a flood of qui\ntam --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the same --\nthat's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced\non the other side. For example, is -- do -- have we\never said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course,\nwith a private Attorney General and all that.\nHave we -- does -- is there any authority\nfor the idea that we should read it restrictively\nbecause of that?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, it does give rise\nto a -- a false claim will, of course, give rise to\ncriminal liability. Moreover, it is a case dealing\nwith --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever -- have\nwe ever said that that's a basis for reading the act\nrestrictively?\nMR. BROWNING: Your Honor, there is some\nolder authority to that affect. The specific case -- I\napologize. The name escapes me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what your claim is --\nis that the government -- the Federal government is not\nthe only person harmed?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore -- you know,\nwe should listen to them, so long as they don't -- they\nwant to come out this way, you are saying the State and\nlocal governments --\nMR. BROWNING: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- are significantly\nharmed.\nMR. BROWNING: We are -- we are partners --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which the Federal\ngovernment doesn't care about, right?\nMR. BROWNING: The Federal government has, I\nthink, taken a very short-sighted view because these\nsort of qui tam actions will be very disruptive to what\nthe Federal government's partners are actually doing in\nthe trenches in administering these programs.\nMoreover, the Federal False Claims Act -- it\nis clear that it is not exclusively Federal. When it\nwas amended in 1986, Congress changed Section 3732(b),\nwhich allowed pendent State claims to be brought, so a\nState, if there is a Federal false claims action, could\nintervene to protect the State's portions of the -- the\nmonies that are at issue.\nMoreover, in Section 3733(l)(7)(A), the\ncivil investigative demand provisions, Congress\nexpressly viewed the word \"administrative\" to include,\nnot only Federal administrative proceedings, but State\nadministrative proceedings as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your point here is -- I\nwill put it in cash terms, is the Federal government,\nwho will pay a lot of qui tam lawyers some percent to go\nand look through all these State criminal hearings and\nState reports and all these things that didn't get into\nthe newspaper and to bring cases, so it may be cheaper\nto pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that.\nNow, your point is that they get a little\nover-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions\nthat maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the\nFederal government is going to have to hire people to\nsort those out anyway, and so would the States in that\nkind of mess.\nIs that your point?\nMR. BROWNING: Yes. They will be very\nenthusiastic if they can simply take a State report\nshowing Medicaid fraud and bring a qui tam action. That\nwill be very disruptive to states and to local\ngovernments.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
