        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 01-704, United States v. Bean.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn each year's annual Appropriations Act,\nCongress has prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nand Firearms from investigating or acting upon\napplications for discretionary relief from firearms\ndisabilities under 18 U.S.C. 925(c.) The court of appeals\nheld that, in the face of that statutory bar, a Federal\ndistrict court could itself grant respondent relief from\nfirearms disabilities. That holding is contrary to\nfundamental principles of judicial review of agency action\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act. Under the APA --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- you call it a statutory bar. I\nthought there was some difference in appropriations\nstatutes from ordinary, ordinary laws. Are the two\nexactly the same? Could Congress create a substantive\nobligation, for example, in an appropriations law, provide\nthat, oh, I don't know, nobody shall sell stock on\nTuesdays? Could they put that in an appropriations\nmeasure?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. An appropriations law is,\nfor purposes of Congress's lawmaking authority, no\ndifferent from any other sort of law.\nQUESTION: That's our holding in Roberts, isn't\nit?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Now, what the Court has\nsaid is that if a subsequent appropriations statute is\nsaid to repeal or suspend the application of a prior law,\nthat intention has to be made clear, but here we think\nthat there's no question that the annual Appropriations\nAct is clear. There's nothing implied about what Congress\ndid here. There is an express prohibition against ATF\neither investigating or acting upon applications for\nrelief.\nQUESTION: You call this a suspension of the\nlaw?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I mean, effectively. It's\na suspension -- it's an annual -- a suspension for a\nperiod of 1 year.\nQUESTION: I suppose Congress -- well, maybe --\nI mean, I suppose Congress could say, this law that we\nenacted a year ago is suspended for 10 years. It will not\ngo into effect for 10 years. I suppose it could say that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, absolutely. Congress could\ncertainly do that.\nQUESTION: Well, that's the holding of\nDickerson, is it not?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. So what we have here is an\nexpress prohibition against ATF exercising the power that\nCongress conferred on it. Under the Administrative\nProcedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial\nreview of agency action is to review what the agency did,\nand it may only set aside the agency action if the agency\naction is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.\nQUESTION: I don't know if it really bears on\nthe case, but suppose Congress had a completely different\nscheme, and it said that the firearms violator's license\ncould be restored if he applied to United States district\ncourt, no agency at all, you just go to court. Would that\nbe a violation of Article III?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think there would be a\nquestion about that. As I recall, there was, and I think\nit still may be true that courts may grant applications\nfor naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that\nthere was at least an implicit adversarial process in the\nsense that the Government could appear on the other side\nof the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very\ngood point in terms of what would be the traditional way\nthat something like this would be accomplished, and that\nis that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did\nin 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive\nbranch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and\nthen provided that a person whose application is denied\nmay file a petition in district court for judicial review\nof such denial.\nIn other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by\nthe ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject\nof judicial review.\nQUESTION: Is the refusal of the ATF to act on\nan application pursuant to this provision in the\nappropriation a de facto denial that's reviewable?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think it is not. As we\nexplained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that\ncontext means a denial on the merits, and this is what a\nnumber of the courts of appeals that have looked at the\nquestion have held, and what Congress said in the\nAppropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting\nupon the application. In other words, it can't either\ngrant or deny the application for relief, and therefore\nthe predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing.\nWe're not saying that there is no judicial\nreview at all. The general provisions of the APA remain\navailable and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial\nreview, or the form of the judicial review is either the\nspecial statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c),\nor in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another\nappropriate form, in other words, the general provisions\nof the APA.\nBut once again, the power of a court under the\ngeneral provisions of the APA is simply to review the\nagency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law,\nand here the action was not contrary to law, it was\ncompelled by law. The most direct avenue that respondent\ncould have challenged the agency's approach in this case,\nits failure to act, was under section 706(1), which\nprovides for a court in reviewing agency action to set\naside agency action that is -- or excuse me, to compel\nagency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully\nwithheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about\nATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's\napplication for relief, because Congress compelled that\nwithholding.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, there was an alternate\nargument that a foreign conviction shouldn't count for\nthis purpose. Has the United States ever taken a position\non that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, we have. It is the\nposition of the United States that foreign convictions are\ncovered by the act. Now, that is not before the Court.\nThe -- in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign\nconviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the\nEleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that\nquestion. It wasn't presented in the petition and it's\nnot before this Court.\nIndeed, the question of whether a foreign\nconviction would be a proper predicate is something that\nwould be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution. As we\npoint out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on\nthat question, but that conflict has arisen in cases,\ncriminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would\nbe the proper place to begin to make that claim.\nNeither the general provisions of the APA nor\n925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or\nmay not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal\nlaws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United\nStates to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in\nwould be covered by a particular criminal statute. So\neven though it -- it isn't before this Court, but we also\nbelieve that this would not be the proper avenue in which\nto raise such a claim in any event.\nRespondent has argued that what is going on here\nis an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case\nsuch as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied.\nWhat Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise\nleft the court's authority unaffected. 925(c) remains in\neffect. It's just that, by virtue of Congress's\nprohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief,\nthere is no denial which could be the predicate for review\nunder that, under that special statutory review procedure.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think that that's 100\npercent clear? I mean, in Robertson, the amendment of a\nprior statute was affected not by the simple means of\nwithholding appropriations. I mean, it set forth\ndifferent language that was going to govern the matter.\nHere, the only thing that has happened is\nthey're not given any appropriations, and you think it is\nnot a matter -- you think it's entirely clear that when\nthe Secretary receives an application and says, I cannot\nact on this application because the appropriations rider\nforbids me, do you think it's entirely clear that that\ndoes not amount to a denial of the application?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's the better reading\nof the statute.\nQUESTION: Well, it may be the better one, but\nis it clear? I mean, the law is that unless you make it\nquite clear in the appropriations statute that you are\nintending to amend the prior law, the prior law is not\namended.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Again, the -- our position is not\nthat Congress amended the judicial review provision of\n925(c). What it did was prohibit ATF from acting.\n925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect.\nThe question is whether the -- whether Congress's\ndirective to ATF not to even act upon applications for\nrelief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred\nfrom either granting or denying relief, and I would refer\nthe Court also to the general definition of agency action\nunder the APA, which we cite in our brief. This is 5\nU.S.C. 551(13). It defines agency action as an agency\nrule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,\nor the denial thereof, or a failure to act.\nSo under the APA, which is the general statute\ngoverning traditional review of agency action, Congress\nitself has defined a denial of relief as something\ndifferent from a failure to act, and I think there's every\nreason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being\nconsistent, rather than inconsistent with the general\ndefinitions that Congress has applied under the APA.\nI would also add, though, that it doesn't\nmatter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a\ndenial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA\nstandards for reviewing that denial still apply. As we\npoint out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and\nthe prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive\nEngineers both make clear that, even where you do have a\nspecial statutory review procedure that establishes the\nform for judicial review, the nature and character, as the\nCourt said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that\njudicial review is defined by the general provisions of\nthe APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions\nthe court can only set aside agency action that is\ncontrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was\ncompelled by law, not contrary to it.\nSo whichever avenue this suit was thought to\nhave been brought under, there was no basis for the\ndistrict court to grant relief at all, and we also think\nthat that is entirely consistent with the Congress's\npurposes in enacting the appropriations bar.\nThe legislative history which respondent has\nproduced as an appendix to his brief explains that\nCongress had become concerned about the inherently\nsubjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking,\nand the severe consequences that could result if ATF had\nmade a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the\nmoney that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a\nyear for 40 positions at ATF, would be better served --\nQUESTION: Why didn't it just repeal the thing,\nthen, because it didn't have the votes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, what it decided to do is to\nproceed on an annual basis. It would -- which means it\ncould be subject to revision each year. It was a\npractical compromise. The Third Circuit explained in\nPontarelli that the same people who were supporting a\npermanent repeal in 1992 were also the movants for the\nannual appropriations rider on the theory that it\naccomplished essentially the same thing on an annual\nbasis.\nQUESTION: This was in the appropriations law\njust for the ATF, or for the whole Treasury Department?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's in the provision for ATF.\nQUESTION: Suppose that the Secretary had some\nother agency -- the Secret Service didn't have much to do\nthat month; could he direct them to process some of these\napplications?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think not, for there is another\nsentence in the appropriations provision for ATF which\nsays that no money may be spent to transfer functions from\nATF to another department or agency, and I think the\nreference to agency in that provision would probably\ninclude other provisions -- or excuse me, other agencies\nwithin the Department of the Treasury, and the Secretary\nof the Treasury personally couldn't be expected to act on\napplications like this. The Secretary, as this Court\npointed out in the Dunne decision, has --\nQUESTION: Well, would he abuse his discretion\nif he took that function away from ATF? You say that\nthere's a provision in the statute that he -- that the\nSecretary himself cannot transfer the function?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It says, no funds shall be\nspent -- I believe it says, under this act, to transfer\nfunctions to another agency within ATF.\nQUESTION: Well, how much money does the --\nwould the Secretary spend if he signed an order\ntransferring a function?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the clear import of what\nCongress directed is, the function shall not be\ntransferred. That was clearly what Congress was driving\nat.\nQUESTION: It wouldn't be a transfer to another\nagency if the Secretary did it himself.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, but the Secretary -- first\nof all, as Congress well knew when it passed this\nappropriations rider, the Secretary has delegated the\nauthority for acting on these applications to ATF. That\nis the legal framework against which --\nQUESTION: What he gave he could withdraw.\nQUESTION: He could revoke.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Perhaps he -- I mean, he\npresumably could, but the proper avenue for a respondent\nto pursue in that situation would be to request ATF -- or\nexcuse me, the Secretary to revoke the regulation that\nproduced the delegation, and then if the Secretary\ndeclined to do that, to seek review of that under the APA\non an arbitrary and capricious standard.\nRespondent has not pursued that avenue, and we\nthink it would manifestly not be arbitrary and capricious\nfor the Secretary to withdraw that delegation and take on\nthat function himself with all the other functions that\nare before the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to\nthe Nation's economy and banking and all those other\nmatters, and in particular it would not be arbitrary and\ncapricious for the Secretary to decline to do that in the\nface of the appropriations bar that Congress has enacted,\nwith the -- again, with the clear understanding that it\ndidn't want these applications to be acted on\nadministratively, but in any event --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, if we shift the focus\nfrom the agency to the court, is it your essential\nargument that Congress provided for an appellate,\nessentially an appellate role for the district court and\nnot a first instance role?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that --\nQUESTION: So that the only authority the court\nwould have would be to review a decision made by an\nexecutive official, but there is a provision in this law\nfor the district court to take additional evidence.\nUsually when a court is performing a review function it\ndoesn't take any evidence.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me. That's correct, but\nit would -- but even the admission or acceptance of\nadditional evidence would be in aid of the APA review,\nwhich is, again, of the agency's decision. A court\nreceiving evidence is not unheard of under the APA, even\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard. As this\nCourt pointed out in Overton Park, occasionally there will\nbe situations in which additional evidence or an\nexplanation from the agency could be received in judicial\nreview, but that's only supplemental of the record that\nwas before the agency.\nQUESTION: Well, but the agency doesn't always\nhave to make a record. I mean, suppose the agency just,\nyou know, just makes a decision. Why can't this Court\ntreat it as a matter of review? That is, the issue before\nthe Court will be whether the action here, assuming it's a\ndenial, was unreasonable?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The question before the Court\nwould be whether it was arbitrary and capricious or\nunlawful, and again, it wasn't unlawful because Congress\ncompelled it. Congress compelled the Secretary or ATF not\nto act on the application. Now, whether or not that's\ncalled a denial, the bottom line, the failure to afford\nany relief, was compelled by Congress, so the agency could\nnot set -- or, excuse me, the court could not set that\naside.\nLooked at another way, the only relevant\nevidence that would be introduced in court would be\nevidence of the fact that respondent had applied during a\ntime when the statutory bar on ATF's action was pending.\nThat is the only relevant evidence that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a\nquestion? Supposing the Secretary or the head of the ATF,\neither or both -- say they spent the weekend together\nsometimes. They read through the papers on their own time\non a Sunday afternoon and said, gee, this is a case of\nrank injustice, I think we're going to grant the petition,\nand they entered some kind of an order granting it, would\nthat have violated any statutes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would. It would violate this\nstatute. The order, whatever they might have read on\ntheir own time the order would be taken in their official\ncapacity, and the -- and --\nQUESTION: But suppose they drafted it on\nSaturday and signed it on Saturday?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would still be a -- the\nsecond --\nQUESTION: It would be in their official\ncapacities but it wouldn't have cost the Government a\ndime.\nQUESTION: Doesn't -- the statute doesn't say,\nofficial capacity. It says, expend funds.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It says expend funds, but it\nmeans to act -- but it says, to -- it is directed to the\nactions of the ATF in its official capacity. Only an\nofficial act of ATF could relieve someone from firearms\ndisabilities.\nQUESTION: I suppose the argument is that the --\ncertainly the Secretary, and perhaps all Federal\nofficials, don't get paid by the hour, they get paid for\nall the official actions that they take during the year,\nso that even if they take it on a Saturday they're being\ncompensated for it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct, and --\nQUESTION: Minimally, but compensated.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: They are paid for the office, not\nfor the work that they are performing, nor could the\nSecretary direct ATF to grant it, because again he would\nbe directing an unlawful act.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress, in section 925(c), provided\nindividuals like Respondent Tommy Bean two rights vis a\nvis the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of\nAmerica. Individuals may apply to, quote, unquote, \"the\nSecretary\" for relief from firearms disabilities and, if\nthe Secretary denies that application, they may secure\njudicial review. The obvious flaw in the Government's\nposition this morning, as several of the later questions\nidentified, is that Congress has never, expressly or\nimpliedly repealed those rights vis a vis the Secretary.\nThe appropriations statutes that are before you address\nonly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\nCongress has set aside a separate and special budget for\nthe Department of the Treasury generally, which is under\nthe control of the Secretary, it's for $123 million, and\nthe right to proceed before the Secretary is unaffected.\nQUESTION: Well, now, did your client seek to\nproceed before the Secretary?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Page 27 of the joint\nappendix is the application. It's directed to the\nSecretary of the Treasury, care of BATF. We went, as the\nstatute directs, to the Secretary of the Treasury. The\nSecretary of the Treasury told Tommy Bean that he was not\ngoing to restore firearms rights.\nQUESTION: Well, this was not a personal\nconversation between the two, I take it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't have his number.\nThat's right. We wrote him a letter, as the statute\nrequires.\nQUESTION: Well, he didn't say, denied. He\nsaid, I'm not going to act upon it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And that --\nQUESTION: Whereupon, your remedy under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act would be to sue in district\ncourt for agency action unreasonably withheld.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: With respect, the premise and\nthe conclusion are not -- of your question are not\ncorrect. The ATF on behalf of the Secretary said, I'm not\ngoing to grant you this relief. The definition of\ndenial -- the statute does not say, denial on the merits.\nThe definition of denial is a refusal to grant the\nrequested relief. That's --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, may I back you up just\na bit, because I'm looking at the letter you cited. It is\naddressed to the Secretary, but it's care of Director of\nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Congress\npasses all kinds of laws giving the Secretary authority to\ndo this or that, which the Secretary invariably delegates,\nand I can't think of an instance where a regime of this\norder is taken over by the Secretary herself, rather than\nby some delegatee, but this is the kind of thing that's\nmade to order for, not the top person, but for it to be\ndelegated.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I address both the question\nof whether there are other examples of the scheme we've\ndescribed, which is to say, the agency head does it, and\nthen the question of whether or not, if this were a novel\nscheme, it would matter?\nThe premise that there aren't parallels for this\nis not correct. I can give you three examples. The\nAttorney General is required to personally certify any\nperson who's going to be subject to the Federal death\npenalty. That's 42 U.S.C. -- 18 U.S.C. 3593. Under the\nCivil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, which is\n42 U.S.C. 1997(a), the Attorney General is required to\npersonally certify a prosecution, and there are various\nFederal criminal prosecutions for civil rights violations,\nwhich are at 18 U.S.C. 245.\nQUESTION: How does the statute make it clear\nthat it's a personal obligation or a nondelegable\nobligation? What are the words that it uses, or that\nthose statutes use?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's the two in combination.\n925(c) says the Secretary. 921(a)(17) defines the\nSecretary to mean that individual or the delegate. Then,\nwhat Congress did is, it came along in the appropriations\naction, act and said, we recognize -- well, I'll give --\nthe literal language is that the ATF may not investigate\nor act upon --\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm sorry, my question wasn't\nclear. I want to go to the examples that you were giving\nof personal obligation.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize.\nQUESTION: And you used the adverb,\npersonally --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- certify, et cetera. How do they\nprovide for that so-called personal action?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: They generally say, the Attorney\nGeneral shall certify, and the courts have interpreted\nthat -- I believe there is an example that says,\npersonally.\nQUESTION: Which we don't have here.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We definitely do not have here,\nbut we have the equivalent, and then I'll get to Justice,\nthe underlying question of Justice Ginsburg's, and that\nis, does it matter if this is done in a different way.\nWe have here the parallel, because what happened\nis that Congress defined the Secretary to be that\nindividual or the delegate, and in the appropriations laws\nhas told ATF, as the delegate, that they may not act on\nanything else, and the parallel provision that Mr.\nKneedler pointed to, which is that the Secretary may not\ntransfer to any other division or agency.\nWhat Congress did not say -- and this is\nextraordinarily important. It's the key to the entire\ncase. Congress did not say that no funds in this or any\nother act, or no funds in the subsection dealing with the\nbudget of the Secretary of the Treasury, may be used.\nNow, it is that --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe it didn't say that\nbecause it thought it was perfectly clear that if it\ndidn't want public money used under -- by the delegate, it\npresumably wouldn't want public funds used for the same\npurpose by everybody else, which seems like a fairly\nreasonable assumption.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Maybe --\nQUESTION: I mean, why isn't it a reasonable\nassumption?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It may be, but what --\nQUESTION: Well, if it is a reasonable\nassumption, haven't we got to take that into consideration\nin interpreting the annual bar, and hold against you,\notherwise we'll be clearly -- we would clearly be going\nagainst the intent of Congress?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, and that's the underlying\npoint to Justice Ginsburg's questions. This Court --\nQUESTION: My first question started out, it\nseems that you in the beginning of this process understood\nthat the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was the\nrelevant actor, because you addressed the Secretary care\nof that agency, not the Secretary --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And let me explain why. The 27\nC.F.R. 178144(a), which has never been repealed, required\nus to send it to ATF. We had no choice. There's a\nregulation on the books that says we have to submit it to\nthe Director. We didn't have a choice, but to make\nperfectly clear that it was directed to the Secretary we\nsay, we send it to the Secretary care of ATF.\nBut I need to return to Justice Souter's\nquestion, which is, is it good enough in this case, as in\nmany other instances of statutory construction, to say, we\nget the general sense of what Congress was trying to do?\nThe answer is no. In this area of law uniquely, Congress\nhas to turn square corners. The relevant text of any\nstatute is section 925(c). It's never been repealed. It\nsays --\nQUESTION: What you're saying is that Congress\nwas just wasting its time here. It was trying to do\nsomething. It just didn't accomplish it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Mr. Chief Justice, and let\nme get to that point, and that is, I agree with you that\nit would be foolish to say that the appropriations acts\nare completely ineffective, and if our interpretation were\nto deprive them of any value, we agree it would be highly\nquestionable. It is not.\nThe scheme that results is clearly one under\nwhich the Secretary will grant only those applications\nwhere the right to relief is perfectly clear. Where, as\nin this case, it is --\nQUESTION: How do you know that? You say the\nscheme that results, I don't see how you can see that from\nthe enactment in question.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because, Mr. Chief Justice, what\nCongress did is, it created a system under which the\nsubdivisions underneath the Secretary may not investigate\nor act. It's left to the Secretary, and now it is --\nQUESTION: But the -- that just doesn't fit with\nthe real world. The idea that the Secretary on his way to\nthe International Monetary Fund meeting is going to\naddress an application like this just doesn't make sense.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, with respect,\nwe -- well, first of all, the text of the statute we think\nis enough on its face, but on the question of whether or\nnot it makes sense, we think it does, because -- and I\nwill point you to several other examples in Federal\nfirearms law where Congress has adopted categorical rules\nallowing felons to have their rights restored.\nWe believe this is a safety valve. We're not\nsaying that the Secretary has to grant any particular\napplication. What we're saying is that Congress\nrecognized that there would be extraordinary cases. What\nCongress was faced with was that ATF had spent $20 million\ngranting 3,000 applications, and that's what the\nlegislative history shows that Congress was trying to cut\noff. What we are describing is a very different animal.\nIt is an animal that's in the text of the statute, and\nthat is, the Secretary is still empowered to grant relief.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg, one of the premises of\nyour question was that there's a delegation here. The\ndelegation here is not exclusive. The delegation here\nprovides that -- and this was in 19 -- when the BATF was\ncreated, the Secretary provided that the Director shall\nact under the general supervision of the Secretary and\nunder -- excuse me, and under the supervision of the\nAssistant Secretary.\nThe parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor\nGeneral is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi\ncase, and those were exclusive delegations. In United\nStates v. Nixon this Court said -- and this is at page 695\nof the opinion -- that the special prosecutor had plenary\nauthority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney\nGeneral shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's\ndecision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the\nCourt said that -- the scheme in Accardi was that the\nAttorney General would act only after the Bureau of\nImmigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that\nthe AG would stay out of the process.\nIn any event, not only is this not an exclusive\ndelegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an\nillegal delegation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, I would -- you are\nconcentrating on the agency end of it. Looking at it from\nthe perspective of a court, you seem to be making of the\ndistrict court an entity that doesn't exist in the U.S.\nsystem. You're having the district court in effect being\nan examining magistrate. There is no adverse party.\nYou're having the district court determine whether there's\nsufficient evidence to warrant restoring the license.\nWe don't have district judges performing that\nkind of mixed function, proceeding in that ex parte way.\nIt would be extraordinary for Congress to make such a\nprovision, and yet you want us to infer it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Ginsburg. Here's\nhow it works. The statute contemplates when there's a\ndenial, and we will take up, probably, the question\nfurther of whether or not there's a denial here, but to\nfocus only on the judicial review aspect, when there's a\ndenial, you file a petition with the Federal district\ncourt.\nWhat happens in all the cases would be what\nhappened here, and that is that the district judge orders\nthe United States and the Secretary made the party\ndefendant. They come into the case, and they have the\nopportunity to put on evidence, to examine the\nwitnesses -- that happened here --\nQUESTION: But the United States came in and\nsaid, we are disabled. Congress doesn't want us to play a\npart in that. It seems to me then the -- you fight that\nout, and if the agency isn't disabled, the district court\norders the agency to act. But that's not what you asked\nfor. You asked the district court to restore this\nperson's license, and that's the relief you got.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, you are\ncorrect what we asked for. You are, with respect, not\ncorrect about what the Government said in this case. The\nGovernment did not come in and say, our hands are tied.\nThe Government did press its argument that there wasn't\njurisdiction, but it absolutely did participate on the\nfactual side of the case. I can give you examples.\nJ.A. 51 is the examination of Tommy Bean, and\nthen the cross-examination by the Assistant United States\nAttorney. J.A. 55 is the opportunity given to the United\nStates to cross-examine the chief of police. We --\nQUESTION: Did the United States take the\nposition that this license shouldn't be restored?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. Precisely the opposite.\nJ.A. 37 is the United --\nQUESTION: I don't understand how there was an\nadversary proceeding, then.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: What happened is, they came\nin -- I'm -- I've confused you with the timing. On\nJanuary 20, 199 -- on 2000, there was a hearing held\nbefore the Federal district judge, Judge Fisher. The\nUnited States participated.\nIt did not say, we are prohibited from\nparticipating. They had been given the opportunity to\ntake witnesses, and let me detour very briefly, and that\nis to say that while the appropriations statutes prohibit\nATF from acting on applications, we are now talking about,\nas you've pointed us to, the petition, and there is\nnothing -- and that's the distinction drawn in section\n925(c). ATF is not disabled from participating in the\ndistrict court.\nTo return. There was this hearing on January\n20. The United States was given the opportunity to put on\nevidence and cross-examine witnesses, as I was just\ndescribing. Immediately afterwards, the Respondent Bean\nsubmitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\nafter that adversary proceeding. At J.A. --\nQUESTION: In what sense it was adversary?\nUsually, if the bureau hadn't been disabled by Congress it\nwould say, deny an application, and then there would be a\ndetermination on the merits, but here, apparently there\nwas no position taken on the merits.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm almost there. There was.\nJ.A. 37 is the United States' response to our proposed\nfindings of fact, and they conclude at J.A. 37 that our\nproposed findings of fact are supported by the evidence.\nFinding of fact 27 is that petitioner -- that -- he -- we\nwere the petitioner there. Petitioner, based on the\ncircumstances of his disability and based on his record\nand reputation, would not represent a threat to the public\nsafety, and finding of fact 28 that they conceded was that\ngranting petitioner the relief he requested would not be\ncontrary to the public interest. What happened here is\nthat the evidence was so overwhelming. We had six chiefs\nof --\nQUESTION: Well, why -- if the United States was\na party, as I suppose is the purport of what you're\nsaying, why isn't that a violation of the appropriations\nrider, so that we must disregard it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because, Justice Kennedy,\nnothing in the appropriations rider prohibits either of\nthe two following things: First, the United States\nAttorney showing up and representing the United States,\nrelatedly the Secretary of the Treasury showing up; or the\nATF participating at the petition stage, as opposed to the\napplication stage.\nI think it's very important to recognize here\nthat this case has proceeded up until today on the\nunderstanding of the parties that the evidence about Mr.\nBean's entitlement to relief was overwhelming. Six chiefs\nof police, a priest, a local --\nQUESTION: I don't know that that's an argument.\nI mean, I concede that. I'm still left back at Justice\nScalia's question, because I thought in response to his\nquestion you -- I had the impression you were suggesting\nthat the Secretary had somewhere written a piece of paper\nthat in effect denied the application, and I looked\nthrough this appendix -- I've been doing that and\nlistening at the same time --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and I cannot find that letter.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nQUESTION: All I find in the appendix is\nsomething written by Ms. Pamela Potaczek, who is from the\nATF, and what that says is, because of the restriction we\nare returning Mr. Bean's application for restoration.\nThat's the end of that. He can apply again.\nNow, is there some other piece of paper?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Our position is --\nQUESTION: Well then, if there is no other piece\nof paper, what is the response to Justice Scalia's\nquestion, which was simply that there has been no denial?\nThey return the application, and if your client felt that\nthey should have acted on it, he should file a request in\nthe district court for -- of course, as soon as you do\nthat, the Secretary will come in and say, of course I\ndidn't act on it. That's what Congress meant. And then\nthe question will be whether that's a reasonable\ninterpretation of this statute, and then, of course, the\nGovernment thinks of course it's a reasonable\ninterpretation, and even if it's an incorrect\ninterpretation, at least reasonable.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nQUESTION: Now, that's where I am, which is, I\nthink, what Justice Scalia was raising.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, you have several\nquestions. Let me deal with them in the following terms:\nwas there a denial here, second, does it matter whether\nthere was a denial here, and third, is it sufficient that\nthe Government's position and interpretation is\nreasonable, as opposed to compelled by the statutory\nlanguage?\nThe plain meaning of the word denial is a\nrefusal to grant the relief requested. Our position is\nthat when ATF turns around and sends us a letter saying,\nwe're not going to act, that is -- it's not a failure to\nact, it's a refusal to act. That is a denial, and I can\npoint to their own regulation that means it must be so.\nUnder subsection (i)(1)(3) of the governing\nregulation, which unfortunately is not reproduced in any\nof the documents -- we do cite it, I apologize, but it is\nnot quoted in any of the appendices. Under that\nprovision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms\nlicensee -- let me briefly draw the distinction here, and\nthat is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms\nunder State law, but there are federally licensed dealers,\nimporters, collectors.\nIn the latter class, any person who submits an\napplication to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 30\ndays, until 30 days after the denial. If the Government\nis -- and that's a quote, of the denial of the\napplication.\nIf the Government is correct here, it would make\nthe profoundly -- have the profoundly illogical\nconsequence that no licensed collector has ever been\ndenied, and they all have the right to continue operating.\nQUESTION: Well, that's true if we assume your\nfirst premise, that a failure to act is a denial, and\nthat's the question.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, no, just the reverse,\nJustice Souter. Let me be clear. The regulation says\nthat you get to keep operating under your license until 30\ndays after the denial. What I'm saying is, if you accept\nMr. Kneedler's premise that all these letters that ATF has\nbeen sending out are not denials --\nQUESTION: No, but the -- that provision assumes\nthat there is going to be action upon the request, that\nthe ATF or the Treasury will take it under advisement and\nin effect say, yes, we'll tell you yes or no when we've\nhad time, and that's not what is happening here, and if\nthat, in fact, is a fair distinction, then the statute\nyou're just referring to doesn't even apply.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, if the\nGovernment is correct -- and I won't belabor this point.\nIf the Government is correct that the ATF letters don't\ncount as denials, then every licensed dealer in the United\nStates can continue operating indefinitely.\nQUESTION: Well, once again, we're just going\naround in a circle. If we accept your premise, sure. If\nwe don't accept your premise that a refusal to act and, in\nfact, a very candid refusal to act is tantamount to a\ndenial, then your conclusion doesn't follow and the\nstatute that you refer to doesn't apply.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'll move on, then. I\nrespectfully disagree, but I -- and I think the language\nwill track in our direction, but let me move on, because\nJustice Breyer had two subsidiary questions.\nQUESTION: In respect to that, is there an\ninstance where they sent a letter back to a firearms\nlicensee saying, well, we aren't going to process this\nbecause of the statute, and then the firearms licensee\nsaid, well, you haven't denied it, I'll stay in business,\nand then they went to the firearms licensee and said, no,\nyou can't stay in business?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know the answer to that\nquestion.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, if we don't know\nthe answer to that, we don't know, in other words, whether\nor not this reg does or does not stand in the way.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, my impression --\nQUESTION: So I understand --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: My impression is that it's a\nform letter that goes out to everyone.\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Now, you -- I had promised to\ncome back to the question of whether, in this case, it\nmatters that we didn't get what this Court would conclude\nto be a technical denial letter, notwithstanding if you\naccept the rest of our argument that we have the right to\ncompel the Secretary to give us one, So to play this out,\nour position is that the Secretary had the duty to act.\nThe question back to us is, well, maybe the Secretary\ndidn't act here.\nMy point is, that doesn't matter. The question\npresented by -- before this Court, if I could take you to\nit, is that -- is fundamentally, and this is the text of\nit, whether a Federal district court has the authority to\ngrant relief. The Government has never contended, again,\nin the district court that there was an insufficient\npremise for us to be in district court.\nThe question before this Court is whether or not\nthe right -- excuse me, the provision for judicial review\nin section 925(c) has been repealed, and that takes us\nback to your third question, Justice Breyer, or third\nsubsidiary one, and that is, is it enough -- and this is\nJustice Souter's point. Isn't it enough for us to\nrecognize basically what Congress was after here, and I\nwill turn to the answer. It is no.\nTVA v. Hill, Will, Robertson, many other,\nDickerson, of this Court's precedents make perfectly\nclear, and this was the question that Justice Scalia\nstarted out with, that an appropriations repeal has to be\ncategorical. The conflict between the two statutes,\nsection 925(c) and the appropriations law, have to be\nirreconcilable, and that is not the case here.\nQUESTION: I don't know that that was the\nholding of Dickerson. I mean, they went into legislative\nhistory -- you couldn't just say it jumped out at you.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, then I\nwill take you to TVA v. Hill, which does address this\nissue. The Court has made perfectly clear that the kind\nof legislative history here is the kind of legislative\nhistory that would draw Justice Souter and possibly\nJustice Breyer to the conclusion that we know basically\nwhat Congress was trying to do. Those are Appropriations\nCommittee reports, and this Court could not have been more\nclear that those are not an accurate indicia of\ncongressional intent. There are --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, before we get into\nlegislative history and how it bears on this, I see\nCongress having established traditional roles where the\nexecutive was going to be the investigator, the court was\ngoing to be the reviewer. The agency says, we have no\nauthority to act. When a court says, we don't have\nauthority to act, it's not granting or denying the relief\nrequested, so isn't that the proper way to look at what\nthe agency is doing? When it says, we have no authority\nto act, it isn't granting or denying.\nAnd then on the court, the court said, Congress\nset us up to be a court of review, not first view. The\nagency hasn't looked at it because it says it has no\nauthority to do it. Congress did not give us the\nauthority, ever, to take a first view of this.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, let me -- can\nI start at the end of what I think is the consequence of\nseveral of these questions, and then come back to the\ndifference between administrative review and judicial\nreview, and whether this would just be unknown to American\nlaw?\nThe very best we think that the Government can\nget out of this argument is a judgment of this Court that\nsays we were entitled to a remand to the Secretary. When\nwe came to Federal district court and asked for relief,\nthe best the Government could do was an order that says,\nno, you should have acted.\nWhat can't be the case, we believe, is that the\nSecretary would be able to just let these things pile up\non his desk and say, I've never denied them, tough.\nNow, the -- what we take --\nQUESTION: He didn't deny them. He said the\nagency has no authority to rule on these applications.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right, and if we conclude that's\nnot a denial, we can't get into court.\nThe Government's answer, I think, if we move\ndown the road, will be that we should file another\nlawsuit, an APA lawsuit that says, to compel agency action\nunreasonably withheld, and if you take that position, if\nyou conclude that this is agency inaction instead of an\nagency refusal to act, the surreply to that, the answer is\nthat you should treat this as an APA action. The\nprovision that Mr. Kneedler is quoting to you, 5 U.S.C.\n703, says that the form of an action under the APA shall\nbe the special review provision provided by statute, and\nthat's section 925(c).\nIf we were required to file under the APA we\ndid. That's --\nQUESTION: The serious underlying question here\nis, I agree with you that you found a literal way around\nthis, and so you're saying, well, if there's a literal way\naround it, and you have a statute saying do it, that you\nought to do it, whatever the form of the action is to get\nthe case here, and I guess the underlying thing is, well,\nmy goodness, everyone knows what Congress wants here.\nIt's perfectly obvious.\nAnd so a Secretary who said, I'm not going to\nenforce this statute because Congress doesn't want me to\neven though there's a literal way I could do it without\ntechnically violating the actual language of the\nprohibition, does the Secretary have the right to do that?\nWell, I would think the answer to that question's yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer --\nQUESTION: Because otherwise Congress can't\nwork.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the answer to the question\nis no, and let me explain why.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Kneedler -- thankfully.\nMr. Kneedler framed the question as whether or\nnot the Secretary abused his discretion by not withdrawing\nthe delegation, by saying, I knew what Congress was up to,\nthis is my agency, I know how this thing works.\nThe answer is that this is not a question of\nabuse of discretion. It is a question of a clear\nstatutory command. Section 925(c) says, we can apply to\nthe Secretary, and clearly contemplates that the Secretary\nwill act on these things. It's not an option.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, let me just be sure\nabout one thing. Is your submission limited to cases that\nyou think are totally clear on their face, or does it\ncover cases when there are marginal issues of fact?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The right to apply to the\nSecretary would remain. We think it's clear that the\nSecretary, once his obligation to act is recognized, will\nset up standards. He'll say things like, I'm only going\nto grant relief if it's an -- the legislative history\nrefers to a technical or unintentional violation where\nthere are sworn statements in front of me that make\nperfectly clear this person is no threat whatsoever.\nThat will be up to the Secretary. The Secretary\nwill get to decide, and if he's granting too many\napplications, Congress will come along and say, no funding\nunder this or any other act shall be expended to\ninvestigate or act on appropriation, on 925(c)\napplications.\nThe critical thing, and the -- is that the\nGovernment does not dispute that this appropriations rider\never since 1993 is in the subdivision that applies only to\nATF. If you want to talk about Congress working, they\nneed clear instructions. We can't have the executive\nbranch out here saying, I don't really like this statute,\nand so I'm going to infer that it's been repealed, and we\ncan't have the courts doing that, too. It will take no\neffort whatsoever, if this is what Congress really\nintends, to strip away the statute and to do it in\nappropriations law.\nQUESTION: So I'm still left with -- assuming\nall that, I'm still left with the problem that you've\nasked for the court to make the decision rather than\nasking to have the Secretary make the decision.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. We have a, now, I think,\na different question of administrative law, and that is\nthe fundamental principle, in the APA context or a\nparallel like 925(c), is it only the court that can enter\nthe order saying, you have a right to relief? Or does --\nwhere's the proper order, send it to the Secretary and\nsaying, it would be an abuse of discretion, it's\nabsolutely clear under the statute you're entitled to it.\nNow, the court here did the latter. If this\nCourt decided that was technically incorrect, it could\nreverse on that ground and say, no, no, no, the correct\ntechnical judgment is to put it back in the hands of the\nSecretary.\nQUESTION: But you didn't ask for it to be put\nback in the hands of the Secretary.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And neither did the Government.\nQUESTION: You're saying that the court had an\nobligation to give you something you didn't even ask for?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Justice Scalia, they gave us\nwhat we asked for. I apologize for that. If --\nQUESTION: That was the wrong thing.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If they should have --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If they should have done\nsomething else, then this Court can tell it so, but we --\nI don't think it's fair to hold us to the position that\nthe Government did not object, that only the Secretary --\nin this case, when you go through the district court\nrecord, that the only proper remedy is an order to the\nSecretary to grant us relief, as opposed to granting us\nrelief personally. Remember, as I quoted to you from the\nfindings of fact, the Government left the playing field\nhere. It admitted that with all of the evidence we had,\nno one could reasonably dispute that Tommy Bean was\nperfectly entitled and represented no threat. The only\nquestion -- they participated on the fact side of the\ncase. Their only argument that they attempted to advance\nwas that the district court was powerless to do anything\nat all.\nWith respect, we did what we were supposed to do\nto get relief here, and if the Court decides that it only\nshould have gone to the Secretary, that's a minor change\nin the judgment.\nQUESTION: I still think participation by ATF in\nthe judicial proceeding is within 925(c), and Congress was\nforbidden that, too.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, let me be clear\non what money was spent, because there were technical\nquestions about this. The United States Attorney's Office\nparticipated here, not --\nQUESTION: There was an ATF agent who testified,\nand that's within 925 -- the purview of 925(c), and\nCongress says you can't do that.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: With respect, there was one\nagent who was one witness. The appropriations statute\nsays you may not investigate, which was not what he was\ndoing, and you may not act upon, which was not what he was\ndoing, upon applications, which this was not. It was a\npetition under section 925(c). There was no prohibition,\nand the ATF agent did not object that I'm not allowed to\nbe there. We did -- we put the witnesses on that we were\nsupposed to.\nQUESTION: Can I ask, under your view of things\ncan the Secretary use assistance, or would that constitute\na delegation?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: He can. What he can do is, he\ncan take and is required to take up into his own hands, as\nthe three examples I gave to Justice Ginsburg, the\nresponsibility. He can detail. He has a budget of $123\nmillion, $141,000, and he can take them up into his hands\nand say, look, I've got these sworn statements, and he\ncould require, I want 10 sworn statements. He could\nrequire, I want 20, and he can have someone confirm that\nthat's the right person. But what we do think, and this\ngoes back to the Chief Justice's question, is that we do\nnot think that Congress contemplated that the Secretary\nwould spend $20 million granting 3,000 applications. If\nhe decided --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, you have 10 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, the argument\nthat the Secretary could have granted relief was never\nraised below in this case. It was not raised in the court\nof appeals, it wasn't raised in the brief in opp, it was\nraised for the first time in respondent's brief, and again\nif -- we think the proper avenue for that would be a suit\nto the -- suing the Secretary under the APA or --\nQUESTION: No, but his point, and actually\nalthough he raised it late, is certainly a factor. That\nseems to me the most powerful argument, that there's no\npoint sending it back to the Secretary, really, even\nthough that's the correct procedural route, if the\nSecretary under the law has no choice, and what he's\nsaying is, the Secretary under the law has no choice, and\nthe reason is because literally this appropriations\nmeasure doesn't cover the Secretary's action.\nAnd given the absence of that, the Secretary's\nunder a statute that tells him, act, and moreover, he\nadds, this is a very bad way to repeal a statute, that\nreally under normal legislative principles if they want to\nrepeal it, repeal it; and therefore it isn't wrong for us\nto consider this literally in this circumstance. So that,\nI think, is -- that's an argument that's worth hearing\nwhat the reply is.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- first of all, I think\nit is wrong. It would be a different disposition of the\njudgment, but with respect --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe we'd reach a different --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: The disposition would be one thing --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- but he's saying, that's really\nwhat the heart of this is about.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's -- first of all, let me\nmake another point which I think goes very much to the\nSecretary's authority. We point out on page 4 and 5 of\nour reply brief general principles of appropriations law\nthat are really a particular application of the general\nprinciple that the specific governs the general, and under\nappropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of\nmoney for a particular task, that's all that can be spent\nfor that task. Money can't be drawn from some other pot\nto perform that task.\nWe think that principle should apply a fortiori,\nor at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the\nSecretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the\nexpenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the\nSecretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did\nnot expect money to be drawn from some other pot. That is\na general principle of appropriations law. At the very\nleast, the Secretary should be given the opportunity --\nQUESTION: What is the authority for saying\nthat's a general principle of appropriations law?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There are a number of Comptroller\nGeneral opinions that we cite at the bottom of page 4 of\nour reply brief, and it's against principles like that\nthat agencies always act in deciding how they're going to\nspend money. But if this argument was going to be made,\nthe right disposition would be to present it to the\nSecretary, so the Secretary can construe this statute,\njust like all the other statutes that need to be\nadministered, and the way to do that --\nQUESTION: It's one thing to say that when\nCongress says we give $500,000 to subunit B to perform\nthis function, you cannot use $2 million from somewhere\nelse to perform the same function. That's one thing.\nIt's something quite different, however, to say that when\nyou have forbidden one unit from doing something, and\nthere is a general statute which allows the Secretary to\ndo it, that that prohibition also applies to the\nSecretary. I just don't think it's parallel.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, at the very least it would\nnot be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to\ndecline to withdraw the delegation. That, we think, is\nthe question that would arise in that situation, because\nthe Secretary now may not act on these applications.\nHe -- the ATF acts under the general direction of the\nSecretary, but if the Secretary directed ATF to grant one\nof these applications, he would be directing an illegal\nact. He would have to withdraw the delegation. He hasn't\nbeen asked by respondent to do that, which would require a\npetition for rulemaking.\nThe Secretary, in deciding whether to take this\npower back to himself, could at the very least take into\naccount what Congress has said about not wanting these\napplications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons\nthe Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective\nundertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we\ndon't want this function being performed because of the\npotential consequences. We want this money to be used for\nother purposes in fighting crime. All of that would make\nit entirely reasonable for the Secretary not to take on\nthis function himself.\nThe other important point to notice is that --\nQUESTION: Well, he has a statutory obligation\nto perform the function --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I was just going to\nQUESTION: -- which has not been canceled by the\nappropriations law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: He does not -- nothing in the\nstatute says that the Secretary must act on applications.\nIt says the Secretary may grant relief. It does not\nrequire him to grant relief, and the Secretary could very\neasily withhold action, which is, after all, what Congress\nrequired ATF to do.\nQUESTION: What, on the ground that it's like\nthe pardon power, it's like a matter of grace, or\nsomething like that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, very much so. It's -- it's,\nor, as the Court said four or five terms ago in the Yang\ncase that we cite in our brief with respect to relief from\ndeportation, it is exactly like the pardon power, and it's\nwritten in very broad terms. It establishes several\npreconditions, whether the person would be dangerous to\nthe public safety, and whether granting it would not be\ncontrary to the public interest, and even then the\nSecretary is not required to grant relief.\nThis is a very broad discretionary power, and I\nthink it ties into what Justice Ginsburg was asking\nearlier, wouldn't this be an extraordinary power to give\nto the Federal district courts. Indeed it would, because\nthe question is not just whether the person might be\ndangerous, but whether granting relief would be contrary\nto the public interest. That's not the sort of\ndetermination a court can make in the first instance.\nIt's something that Congress has assigned to the\nSecretary.\nIn this case, even if respondent is correct that\nhe wouldn't be dangerous, it doesn't follow that\nrestoration of firearms abilities would be consistent with\nthe public interest. That's a judgment that Congress\ninvested in the Secretary, not in the courts, and as\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, ATF could not investigate an\napplication for relief in connection with a judicial\nproceeding any more than it could in an administrative\nproceeding.\nThe ATF agent who testified in this case was one\nof respondent's witnesses. He was not called by the\nGovernment.\nQUESTION: Is testifying investigation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: Is testifying investigation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that would be -- we did not\nobject, the Government did not object in the district\ncourt to his testifying. He was just testifying as to\nwhat he had looked up in the records, but an investigation\ninvolves far more than that.\nIn fact, the AUSA in this case cross-examined\nMr. Bean and a couple of other witnesses, but that's far\nshort of the investigation that Congress expected ATF to\nundertake when it was performing these functions, and that\nit did undertake, which involved an investigation of the\ncrime, neighbors, not just the people whom respondent has\nput forward, but ATF would go out and develop its own\nindependent leads. None of that capability exists when\nthe Government is responding to an application filed in\ncourt.\nSo for these reasons we think it is --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- if you've had a chance to complete\nyour rebuttal, I had one question. Do you think the\nSecretary's authority under the statute is broad enough\nso, even without any act of Congress or anything in the\nappropriation, the Secretary could have adopted a policy,\nwe would rather use our money on other purposes and so\nwe're not going to process any applications?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I do believe it's -- it is broad\nenough. I think the Secretary -- all it says is, the\nSecretary may grant relief. I think the Secretary could\ndecide, and in fact the regulations, 144(d) has some\ncategorical exclusions that the Secretary had adopted but\nthe district court in this case ignored. Even -- we think\nthe court couldn't act at all, but it even ignored the\nstandards that the Secretary had adopted in the public\ninterest to implement what would be a public interest\nstandard under the statute. The district court ignored\nthem, so we think that the Secretary could make a\ncategorical determination not to grant relief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
