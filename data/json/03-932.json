        "content": "(10:33 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will now hear\nargument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo. We\nfinally get to the arguments.\n(Laughter.)\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents two disparate views of what\nkind of loss is necessary to sustain a claim for\nsecurities fraud under the Reform Act's loss causation\nrequirement.\nThe minority view of artificial inflation\narticulated by the Ninth Circuit is illogical and equates\nloss with purchase, regardless of whether the investor has\nsuffered any economic harm. An investor does not suffer\nany harm until some form of corrective disclosure occurs\nand the artificial inflation is removed from the stock.\nThe two events must be related. There is no causal\nconnection between the harm and the misrepresentation\notherwise.\nThe majority rule correctly requires a causal\nconnection between the misrepresentation and a decline in\nvalue. The -- and the statute itself is expressed in\nterms of causation that a plaintiff prove that the act of\nthe defendant caused the loss.\nWhen we look at the statute of the Reform Act\nand other provisions, we see supporting language. In\nsection 21D of the Reform Act, we see under the provision\nthat has been known as the look-back provision that the\nCongress discussed the loss in terms of trading price\nafter a corrective disclosure.\nSimilarly in section 105 of the Reform Act,\nalthough dealing with section 12 of the Securities Act,\nthe Reform Act, in its one place where it actually spoke\nof loss causation and its definition, defined it in terms\nof depreciation in value. And the -- the depreciation in\nvalue of the security would be attributable to the fraud.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can you tell me if --\nif we had not granted certiorari in the case and the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion became final, what would have happened\non remand? What would have happened in the trial court?\nMR. SULLIVAN: At the trial court, the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and wouldn't there have\nbeen a -- a motion to make the pleadings more specific and\nthey would have then come up with a measure of damages, or\nam I wrong about that?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, the Ninth Circuit remanded\nfor specific reasons on repleading, which Your Honor has\narticulated, and those would have occurred.\nThe other issues relating to loss raise\nquestions concerning whether some of the -- the claims\nmight be time barred and whether or not those claims could\nbe stated. So that would have raised a different issue.\nIn addition, throughout the pleadings of this\ncase -- we're now on the third complaint -- the -- the\nplaintiffs have not raised that issue and have not sought\nto plead causation consistent with the -- our view of the\nworld.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, I -- I assume\nyou say that the trial judge and -- and defense counsel\nand -- and the trial court would have had real problems\nwith this opinion. What -- what were those problems --\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- insofar as the measure of\nloss is concerned?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, the -- the real problems\nthat the trial court had and what we would continue to\nespouse with this opinion is that it doesn't link the loss\nwith the misrepresentation. And in this case, the\nmisrepresentation offered occurred 9 months after the\nprice drop that is being sought.\nI think when you -- when you carve it all back\nand you look at what the real issue is, at the end of the\nday, it's -- it becomes an issue of what -- what damages\ndoes the plaintiffs' class seek.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under this opinion, how would\n-- under the Ninth Circuit's opinion, how would the jury\nhave been instructed to come -- to calculate the loss? I\nassume you have a problem with that and I want to know\nwhat it is.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The -- the problem is we wouldn't\nhave been able to -- to frame a clear jury instruction\nthat would have indicated whether or not the loss that the\njury should look at would be related to the disclosure\nabout Albuterol Spiros, which would have occurred in the\nNovember time frame, or whether we would have had to step\nback to the February time frame and -- and the loss that\nwas incurred then. And the issue would have not only\nrelated to the -- the damages instructions but would have\nrelated to the misrepresentation instruction.\nAnd the -- the problem that -- that we continue\nto have with the -- the case after the Ninth Circuit's\nopinion is where do you look for the misrepresentation and\nwhere do you look for the damage and how do you know that\nthere is a loss under the statute. You're looking at a --\nat a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What would have happened if\nthe disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company\nannounced revenue shortfalls?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, I think that would have\nbeen different. That would have been a disclosure prior\nto the -- to the drop, and there -- I would expect under\npleading that the plaintiffs could have done, they could\nhave tied the two of them together and argued that the\ncause of the loss was the combination of the two events in\nthe marketplace.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is it difficult to figure\nout what the Ninth Circuit was thinking? I -- I found it\n-- am I right? I thought they said the -- the seller says\nwe found gold. The stock sells for $60. They have loads\nof experts who say in the absence of that statement, which\nwas a lie, we found gold, it would have sold for $10. The\nloss is $50. I mean, I take it that's their theory.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That -- that would be the theory\nunder the Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what's wrong\nwith that theory?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's clear. I mean, it's\ncertainly clear.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The problem with -- with that\ntheory is that Congress has told us that the\nmisrepresentation has to have caused the loss and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They say it caused the\nloss, $50.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And -- and what we would be\nlooking for is evidence that -- that such a actual loss\noccurred in response to a corrective disclosure in the\nmarketplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, doesn't it depend on --\non what you -- what you consider to be the value of the\nstock. Until the disclosure of the fact that they didn't\nfind gold is made, the stock is still worth $60, isn't it?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because everybody else thinks\nthey found gold too. So you're still holding stock worth\n$60, if worth means its market value. Right?\nMR. SULLIVAN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we're dealing with a\nspecial rule that looks to market value. Right? You\ndon't have to have the -- the representation made\nexplicitly to the plaintiff. It's a representation that\nwas made to the market at large which caused the market\nvalue of the stock. Right?\nMR. SULLIVAN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he paid $60, he got $60.\nThere's no loss.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And would have the ability to\ncontinue to sell that stock for $60 in the marketplace\nuntil such time as there was a corrective disclosure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other problem?\nI'm trying to get a list of what the problems are with the\nsimple theory. Now, I've heard one that you've ratified.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and is there any other?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Thank you.\nThe -- the other is -- is I think an issue of\ncertainty as to the marketplace. Remember, we are\noperating on a fraud-on-the-market theory context here in\nthis kind of action, and in that -- in that context, when\nthere is a disclosure in the marketplace, you have\ncertainty as to what the market actually valued the\ndecline to be as opposed to speculation that there was in\nfact inflation at the -- at the time of purchase.\nThe Ninth Circuit's purchase time rule in the --\nin the fraud-on-the-market context doesn't necessarily\nidentify the decline in the value of the stock which you\ncan get from the marketplace, and that I think is just\nbetter -- a better indicator.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, can we -- can they prove\nthis? $60. $50 is wrong, is inflated because of the\ngold. It turns out that gold never existed and they knew\nit. The stock is not selling for $60 anymore. It's\nselling for $200. They found platinum. No one expected\nit. All right. They want to prove maybe it is selling\nfor $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have\nsold for $250. Can they do it?\nMR. SULLIVAN: The Congress has told us that we\nshould look for loss, and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a loss. $250 versus $200.\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- and that leads us to the --\nthe point that -- that whether the increase can actually\nbe pled. But if there is a disclosure that indicates that\nthe gold component was not part of the -- of the -- the\ndiscoveries, and the plaintiffs can indicate that there\nwas an upward tick because of the platinum and a downward\nmovement in the stock because of the disclosure about\ngold, then I think those two can be separated and pled\naccordingly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And both would be all right\nbecause what's the difference between not getting as much\nappreciation as you would have gotten if the correct\ninformation had been out there and getting less than you\nwould have gotten. I mean, in both cases the shareholder\nis affected the same way. They didn't get as much in one\ncase. So you're not distinguishing between those. I\nthink you're agreeing that in both cases the -- the\ndiscovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would\nhave gone up much higher if there had been gold as well.\nThat shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't\nshe?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, that shareholder -- it\nwould depend on what has happened in the marketplace. If\nthere has not been a disclosure about the absence of gold,\nthat stock would still reflect the -- the value of the\nexpectation of gold.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm assuming that --\nthat there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as\nit would have.\nBut on the point of disclosure, there is a\ndifference between your position and the Government's, and\nI really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or\nit's my misperception. Your view is there's the\ndisclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops.\nIn the Government's presentation -- and I'm reading from\npage 19 -- the fraud can be revealed by means other than a\ncorrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may\nnot be a necessary condition for establishing loss\ncausation in every fraud on the marketplace.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Our position is we believe that a\ndrop in the price is necessary to demonstrate the loss.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the Government --\nMR. SULLIVAN: They do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter in this case,\ndoes it? Is -- is that issue before us?\nMR. SULLIVAN: In this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have to decide that issue\nhere?\nMR. SULLIVAN: We don't have to decide that\nissue for this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is it -- is it easy to\nprove that -- that the price of this now valuable stock\nbecause they found platinum would have been $40 higher had\nthey found gold? I mean, the burden would be on the\nplaintiff to prove that -- would -- I mean, if we adopted\nthat theory.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The plaintiff has that burden --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would be very hard to prove,\nit seems to me.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And -- and at the pleading stage,\nI believe that they could be segregated and -- and an\nupward movement in the stock could be distinguished from a\ndownward movement in the stock. But the downward movement\nin stock would be the focus from our standpoint.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in your view, is the\nplaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or\nis it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of-\npocket losses?\nMR. SULLIVAN: We don't believe that they are\nentitled to any expectation damages. It would be an out-\nof-pocket loss calculation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the -- is the respondents'\nposition properly characterized as asking for expectancy\ndamages or is that too simplistic a view?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- I think that it is perhaps\ninclusive of expectancy. It really depends on how you\nview that price inflation theory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think they'd be called\nreliance damages. You know, I used to teach contract law.\nWe would call it reliance damages.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And it gets back in our view to\nthe transaction causation distinction in the securities\ncases that talk about the reliance transaction, price\ninflation that occurs at the front end.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's so then -- then on\nthe platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what\nwould have happened if there had been gold because it\nmight be that the stock would have been worth $400 if\nthere had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he\nonly paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most,\n$50. But if there had been gold, because of the gold\nmarket in the world, it would have been a lot more\nvaluable. And you're saying he can't do that? I don't\nknow. Maybe that question isn't in the case, but that\nstrikes me as a difficult question.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Following your -- your suggestion\nabout the price of gold, it would depend on where that --\nthat disclosure occurred in connection with the price of\n-- the price of gold, if that disclosure occurred, and if\nthere was an economic loss that could be -- could be tied\nto it. The passage of time here is important only insofar\nas it allows for the corrective disclosure and a chance\nfor the market to reflect an economic loss.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Sullivan, you refer to\nthe disclosure as being the key point and when you measure\nthe -- the loss and so forth. What if the information\nleaks out and there's no specific one disclosure that does\nit all and the stock gradually declines over a period of\nsix months?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How would you handle that\ncase?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think that a plaintiff would be\nable to handle that in -- in a pleading and they would\nhave to identify the leaks and if there are several,\nidentify each of them and identify them as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe they don't know\nthe leaks. The only thing they can prove is that there\nwas a gross false statement at the time they bought the\nstock and they don't know what happened to the decline.\nLater on they find out that it gradually leaked out. Do\nthey have to prove exactly how the information became\npublic?\nMR. SULLIVAN: The key is that they have to\nprove that the loss was connected to the misrepresentation\nand that the drop in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they -- they wouldn't\nhave to prove how it came out. They would just have to\nprove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the\nmarket learned the truth. I mean, if it was published in\na -- in a column by some market reporter who doesn't\ndisclose how he found out. So long as the market knows\nthe truth, isn't that all they need?\nMR. SULLIVAN: So I was distinguishing -- yes is\nthe answer to your question. I was distinguishing a\nsituation where the price just trickled down and no one\nknew until later. And the -- the question that Justice\nScalia poses about the -- the leak coming out over time\nbut it is the -- the fact that the market becomes aware of\nthe reason for the misrepresentation, it is in fact\nappropriate.\nThe -- the other point that I would like to\nmake, in addition to the statutory scheme, is -- is this\nCourt's decision in Basic v. Levinson creates a tension\nhere, and I -- and I think a conflict that is very\nimportant to -- to discern. The -- Basic v. Levinson\npresents the fraud-on-the-market theory, and from that\nfraud-on-the-market theory we have a rebuttable\npresumption of reliance for transaction causation.\nThe Ninth Circuit's view collapses the -- the\nNinth -- the Ninth Circuit's view of transaction causation\nwith loss causation and presents a conflict as it relates\nto that presumption. The presumption, which is based on a\nwell- developed, efficient capital market that gets the\ninformation out quickly and is easily digestible -- that\n-- that presumption is at odds with the Reform Act's\nrequirement that there be a burden of proof. If you\ncollapse the transaction causation and the loss causation,\nyou've got a head-on collision between the rebuttable\npresumption of reliance and the Congress' codification of\nthe Loss Causation Act and the Reform Act. And we think,\nat the end of the day, the Ninth Circuit's decision really\nrenders that conflict apparent and makes the act of\nCongress in the Reform Act one that was meaningless.\nThe -- I think the legislative history is also\nsupportive of our position so far as particularly the\nSenate report is very important in the -- in the phrase\nwhere it talks about the obligation of the plaintiff to\nprove that the loss in the value of the stock was caused\nby the section 10(b) violation and not by other factors.\nThat is a critical component here of the analysis and I\nthink very helpful from the standpoint of the legislative\nhistory in identifying what we have.\nFinally, I -- the last point I'd like to make is\nthat the Reform Act from Congress was designed to and\nsought to establish uniform and fairly stringent pleading\nguidelines, and this was to address congressional concerns\nover frivolous suits. And Congress, in enacting the\nReform Act, was not signaling any intention to relax the\nrequirements of section 10(b), was -- rather, was enacting\na very specific loss causation requirement. And\nhistorically there was a very clear and distinct body of\nlaw at the time, the Huddleston case, the Bastian case,\nand that was codified. And there was a very clear\nperception that Congress was acting and not collapsing the\nloss causation transaction rule into the loss -- the\ntransaction causation into the loss causation, which I\nthink creates this conflict.\nIf there are no further questions, Justice\nStevens, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You certainly may.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn a fraud-on-the-market case, a plaintiff who\nbuys a security at an inflated price suffers no loss at\nthe time of purchase because the market continues to value\nthe security at the inflated price, and that's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you tell us how you\ndiffer with petitioner on what ought to happen here and\nwhy?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, our view -- well, what ought\nto happen in this case is that the judgment of the court\nof appeals should be reversed because the court failed to\nrequire loss causation. In effect, what the court said is\nthat transaction causation is sufficient. But what --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You agree with the bottom\nline.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, where do you disagree?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not sure that I can\naccurately tell you petitioners' position, but I can tell\nyou our position, which is that in a fraud-on-the-market\ncase the plaintiff cannot -- has failed to plead loss\ncausation unless the plaintiff pleads that the -- the\ninflation attributable to the misrepresentation or\nomission has been removed or reduced from the price of the\nstock through dissemination of corrective information of\nsome sort to the market. That does not mean that the\ncompany must make an announcement or that there must be an\nadmission of fraud or that there must be really any\ninformation, any -- any sort of formal disclosure. But if\nthe information is disseminated to the market such that\nthe market, in whole or in part, becomes aware of the\ntruth and adjusts the price accordingly, that price\nadjustment is loss and the plaintiff has alleged loss\ncausation in an amount to be proven at trial.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, doesn't the general\nrule 8 governing complaints -- isn't that adequate? You\nhave to plead under that every element of an affirmative\ncase.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's right. Exactly right, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why is the Government\nproposing that you have to follow rule 9 not 8 or some\nother requirement?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, the -- I don't think the\nquestion -- we cited rule 9(b) in our brief because fraud\nmust be pled with particularity and -- and that -- and\nthat rule applies to all the, quote, circumstances\nconstituting a fraud. But the Court doesn't need to\naddress the question because even under rule 8, the\nplaintiff must allege all the elements of the cause of\naction.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We don't have to get into\nthat.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct. That's absolutely\nright.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Hungar, if you look\nat the forms of what's proper pleading under the Federal\nrules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example,\nfor money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money\nlent. Period. Or for goods sold and delivered. Nothing\nmore. Just alleged causation. Defendant -- plaintiff\nalleges I lost X amount and it was caused by defendant.\nI thought you pointed to the 9(b) rule because\nfraud must be pleaded with particularity, but causation\ndoes not, not under the rules and not under the statute.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, as we said in our brief, we\nthink 9(b) applies here. Obviously, this is a fraud case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that's to the --\nto the allegation of fraud, but not causation.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Congress has made very clear\nthat loss causation is an element of the cause of action.\nThe elements must be pled. In a fraud case, they must be\npled with particularity, but even -- even in a -- in a\ncommon law --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It says -- but the fraud\nmust be pleaded with particularity, not all the elements\nof a fraud claim.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, with respect, Your Honor, we\nthink circumstances -- it does not constitute fraud if\nthere is no loss causation. At least it certainly doesn't\nconstitute securities fraud under this statute, and if the\ncomplaint does not plead loss causation, it hasn't pled\nfraud. So we submit that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not correct I don't\nthink. I think there could be a completely fraudulent\nstatement but no -- no damages as a result of it. There\nwould still be fraud.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, but in a -- in a private\naction for securities fraud, loss causation is an element\nof the cause of action. It's not an element in every\nfraud case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not an element of the\nfraud. It's an element of the cause -- cause of action.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it may be a semantic\nquestion. That's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's what Justice\nGinsburg's point --\nMR. HUNGAR: But there -- I mean, there are\ncases in the -- in the courts of appeals saying that --\nthat rule 9(b) applies to all the elements, and we're not\naware of cases -- the -- the -- one of the amicus briefs\ncites cases which focus on the nature of the\nrepresentation, and that's certainly where 9(b) issues are\ngenerally fought out because in a -- in a typical\nsecurities case, loss causation is not a difficult issue\nbecause the -- the bad news is -- is announced, the stock\ndrops, and the plaintiff pleads loss causation as a matter\nof course. It -- it's -- it's not a difficult burden to\nsatisfy in your run-of-the-mill securities case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In any event, the difference\nbetween getting the -- the complaint dismissed on the\npleadings or having to wait for a -- a 12(b)(6) motion\nbecause as soon as you, you know, ask for the -- the proof\nof the elements of the cause of action, you're entitled to\nhave, if -- if your analysis of the case is correct,\nyou're entitled to have the drop in -- in the value of the\nstock shown.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, as a -- as a practical\nmatter, Your Honor, there's a huge difference in how these\ncases are litigated because it's the difference between\nspending millions of dollars on discovery, literally\nmillions of dollars on discovery, or not. If -- if the\nplaintiff has failed to allege loss causation and for some\nreason feels unable to allege it, the -- the case is going\nto be dismissed. If the court doesn't require loss\ncausation, as the Ninth Circuit did -- did here, that\nmeans the case is going to go to discovery and the\ndefendant is going to have to either spend millions of\ndollars on their own lawyers or spend millions of dollars\nto settle even in a case that -- where the plaintiff might\nbe unable to establish loss causation. That's why --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is the --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- Congress did what it did in\n1995.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the reason -- is there a\nfurther reason that they've got to -- to plead loss\ncausation? And that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as\n-- as making -- as -- as saying that if you were going to\nrecover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect\nhave -- have got to prove your loss in a certain way. And\nyou're saying if you're going to -- if you're going to sue\non a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all\nthe elements of fraud on the market. And if you allege\nall the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to\nallege exactly what you've just been saying is required.\nSo it's not so the -- I -- I guess what I'm --\nI'm getting at is maybe what -- maybe the nub of the\nanswer is not necessarily that there's -- that there's\nfraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory\nas the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the\nbasis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an\nelement.\nMR. HUNGAR: I think that's -- that's a helpful\nway to look at it, Justice Souter, because it's -- in --\nin a fraud-on-the-market case, by definition the plaintiff\nis alleging that there was an efficient national market\nand that is what makes the difference. If this were the\n-- you -- you buy a gold mine, like the -- the old common\nlaw cases that respondents cite, there's no efficient\nnational market on which the -- the plaintiff can turn\naround and sell it at the same price until the information\nhas been disclosed. But when it is an -- a national,\nactive stock market, the market continues to reflect the\ninflation, and so -- so the plaintiff has not been\ninjured, and the allegation that it was an efficient\nmarket and I bought it at an inflated price does not\nsupport an inference of -- of injury. And the -- and so\nbecause it is a fraud-on-the-market case, that's exactly\nright. The additional information must be pled in the\ncomplaint or else no injury has been -- been pled and the\ncomplaint must be dismissed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you take the\nposition that the phrase in (e)(2), if the plaintiff --\nI'm sorry. Let me find it.\nMR. HUNGAR: You're referring to section 12(b)\nor?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm trying to find a\nphrase in (e)(2).\nIf the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by\nreference to the market price of a security, do you take\nthat phrase as -- as referring to a fraud-on-the-market\ntheory or as being broader than a fraud-on-the -- on-the-\nmarket theory.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I suppose a plaintiff in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It certainly includes it.\nThere's no question about that. Does --\nMR. HUNGAR: I think what that encompasses is a\n-- is a case in which the plaintiff purchased the stock on\nthe market -- on -- on a open market, which will typically\nbe in practice a fraud-on-the-market case. I suppose a\nplaintiff, in an unusual case, might not allege -- might\nnot choose to plead it as fraud-on-the-market case if they\nhave some specific evidence or reliance that they view is\nstronger, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if it's not confined to\nfraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the\nother side that all -- all (2) is really doing is saying\nthat if you are going to establish your damages by\nreference to market price, this is the way you've got to\ndo it. You've got to go through this mean price analysis\nand so on. But they are saying we are not simply trying\nto establish our damages by reference to the market, and\ntherefore we're not bound by -- and therefore, (e)(2), in\neffect, is -- is irrelevant. What -- what is your\nanswer?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think they -- they\nunquestionably are trying to establish their damages. The\nNinth Circuit's damage theory or -- or injury theory\nestablishes damages by reference to the market price.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: To the -- to the purchase\nprice.\nMR. HUNGAR: The plaintiffs alleged they\npurchased at the market price in this fraud-on-the-market\ncase, and -- and the damages are the difference between\nwhat they paid at that market price and what it should\nhave been. That is in our view an attempt to establish\ndamages by reference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they paid -- they paid\nwhether it was a market price or not. I mean --\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, they -- they alleged they\npurchased on the market. If -- if they weren't purchasing\non the market --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what they paid happens to\nbe the market price, but -- but you can't really say that\nthe Ninth Circuit was referring to the market price as\npart of its -- its damages. Its damages are what they\npaid. Whether that -- if they paid above market, it would\nbe the same.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in any event, we interpret it\nto refer to -- I mean, by definition they are, in a fraud-\non-the-market case, alleging that they have purchased at\nthe market price, and that's exactly what this statute\nwould be encompassing. But beyond that, as -- as Mr.\nSullivan identified, Congress' explanation of how it\nunderstood loss causation, when it -- when it enacted\nsection 12(b) as part of the Reform Act, is entirely\nconsistent with our position, and the common law is\nentirely consistent with our position.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Coughlin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK J. COUGHLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. COUGHLIN: Justice Stevens, may it please\nthe Court:\nIn answer to your question, Justice Kennedy,\nyes, that's what -- exactly what we would do. We would go\nback and replead, if we were required to do that, with\nmore specificity.\nWe don't think that (9)(b) applies in this\nsituation because both the Eleventh and the Third Circuits\nhave held that (9)(b) only applies to the circumstances\nconstituting fraud. It has never been applied to\nmateriality, loss causation, or damages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But surely they wanted to have\na person be able to read a complaint and just understand\nwhat it's about in a securities fraud case. And I don't\nsee how you could understand it unless you have in the\ncomplaint what your theory is. That's all. Nobody is\nasking for some facts. Is your theory that the loss took\nplace at the time the person bought the stock because he\noverpaid $30? Is your theory that the stock went down\nand, because of that, he lost the money? Is your theory\nthat the stock didn't go down but it would have gone up\nmore? All they're asking is not for evidence, but a\nsimple, clear explanation of the theory, and plead in the\nalternative if you want. But I mean, what's the problem?\nWhy is that so hard to do?\nMR. COUGHLIN: I don't think that's so hard to\ndo. And you're right. We have to plead the theory, and\n-- and the theory is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And this case doesn't seem to\ndo it. I looked through the entire complaint. I found\nexactly two paragraphs. I didn't. My law clerk did,\nfrankly.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I told him to underline it.\nIn paragraph 179, he found the word, and it\ncaused damage. Okay? And in paragraph 177, it says the\nsame. That's all he could find. And they were harmed.\nThat's what it says.\nMR. COUGHLIN: And -- and you're right, Your\nHonor. There's not much in here. We plead the rises.\nThere are approximately seven rises. We plead the\npurchases. We plead the big drop. Do we plead with\nspecificity? The -- the losses as to AlSpiros? No. We\ncould have done a better job.\nUnder the Ninth Circuit, though, the law, as we\npled it at the time, was that we have to plead an\ninflation and identify the causes. And that's what we did\nunder Ninth Circuit law. If this Court were to decide\nthat we had to do more, could we? Certainly.\nI mean, we have some of the information in\nthere. We -- we tie AlSpiros to the sales force, which is\nan announcement on 2/24. You know, there's a lack of\nintegrity in management.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a -- but there --\nthere is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in\nthe colloquy with Mr. Hungar -- one thing is the\nparticularity of pleadings. Yes, you have to tell the\ndetails of the fraud. No, you don't have to tell the\ndetails of the loss. But you do have to have a theory on\nwhich you can recover, and if your theory is simply I\nbought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a\nclaim for relief on that theory, then you're out the\nwindow. There's no discovery. There's nothing.\nYou have to have, as Justice Souter pointed out,\na viable theory of relief, and that's the difference\nbetween -- you say it's enough that the stock was selling\nfor much more than it should have, and the other side\nsaid, no, that's not enough. You have to show that when\nthe misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Your Honor, I don't think it's\nenough to prove that we just paid an overinflated price.\nYou cannot recover under Ninth Circuit law unless you not\nonly prove that you paid an inflated price, but also that\nyou prove that inflation came out.\nI think where we differ from the Government and\npetitioners is that it -- conceptually, at least with the\nGovernment, the right framework is to analyze did the\ninflation come out of the stock. And our quarrel here is\nhow can the inflation come out of the stock? Does there\nhave to be a corrective disclosure? And we say no. Time\nitself can take inflation out of the stock.\nCompany-specific information is our biggest\nconcern. If somebody walks a stock down, so to speak,\nthey give out information lowering expectations because\nstock prices are based on cash flow. If they walk it down\nand say, hey, our -- we're going to have a revenue miss,\nbut they don't announce their problems with AlSpiros at\nthe time, or we're closing some factories, or we're taking\na significant write-off, that stock drops. We believe\nthat lowers inflation.\nI think a good case to take a look at to\nillustrate this is the Wool v. Tandem case out of the\nNinth Circuit. In that case, Tandem was shipping to its\nown warehouses for 2 years, lying about its revenues.\nWool went out and bought the stock. The stock was\ninflated. The Wall Street Journal, subsequent to that,\nreported we don't see how Tandem can continue to book\nthese revenues, and then the company itself lowered\nexpectations in one of their SEC filings saying, hey,\nlower than expected revenues coming up. The stock has\ndropped and now Wool sells. And now then after that, it's\nadmitted that there was a fraud. Does -- and the stock\nbarely drops hardly at all because the expectations in\nthat stock have already been taken out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I don't understand. I\nmean, there would be even more expectation taken out after\nthe fraud is announced. I mean, it's just like saying,\nyou know, besides -- besides fact that our CEO just died,\nthere's no gold there. Don't you think it would go down\nstill further?\nMR. COUGHLIN: Maybe and maybe not much. It\ndepends on what's your cash in the bank. In this case,\nthey had gone to the market and gotten $400 million of\ncash in the bank. So as the expectations were lowered\nwith the Ceclor CD sales here not once but twice and the\nsales force inadequacy, before it was ever announced, they\nknew when the FDA was coming out.\nThis is not the perfect situation. You're\nright. We could have just taken this out and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it sounds to me as if the\nthings you're saying now are matters for proof, and I -- I\nthink the wiggle room in the Government's position was it\nsaid it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or\nother. Well, if you're prepared to be broad and turn\nthose over to the experts for the proof, you end up with\nyour theory. The -- the inflation comes out and it comes\nout because they didn't get the earnings that they would\nhave had or there may be many reasons.\nMR. COUGHLIN: There's no doubt, Your Honor.\nAnd if we have to do it at the pleading stage, it would be\nimpossible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you just have to say at\nthe pleading stage what your theory is.\nMR. COUGHLIN: And -- and I think we did that.\nWe said the stock was inflated and there was damage, and\nwe could have done a better job. Absolutely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your theory was, at\nleast as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the\nmoment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you\nbought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when\nyou suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at\na later time.\nMR. COUGHLIN: That's absolutely correct. We\nbelieve that you suffer your loss and damages on the date\nyou make the purchase. On the day --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you reconcile that with\nyour concession that if the person who -- who buys it at\nan inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it\nat that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit? You\nwould not allow recovery in that situation.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Would not allow recovery in\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how can you reconcile\nthat --\nMR. COUGHLIN: Because those --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- with the notion that the\nloss occurred at the time your purchased?\nMR. COUGHLIN: Justice Scalia, because those are\n-- what we're talking about are recoverable damages, and\nthen there's a limitation from section 28. In other\nwords, all the cause of action was satisfied on the date\nyou overpay. The day you pay $100 for a stock that's\nworth $50, you're out the $50, the economy is out the $50\nbecause it's not working -- it's working a fraudulent\nmarket. But you cannot recover, we would agree, until\nlater.\nAnd the problem with analyzing that at the\npleading stage is that is the -- that is expert analysis\nand discovery to connect up how -- how the losses came out\nand what you can recover. So I agree with you that you\ncannot recover that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're saying there's no\nlosses. I mean, that's -- it's inconsistent how the\nlosses come out. You just told us the loss occurs, bang,\nwhen you buy it. You've gotten stock that really isn't\nworth what you paid for it, the notion of -- of worth as\nsome -- you know, some objective thing rather than what --\nwhat people are willing to pay.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's your theory and it\nseems to me you're stuck with it. And if that theory is\ntrue, then it shouldn't matter that you later sell it to\nsome other poor, unsuspecting individual for the same\namount you bought it for.\nMR. COUGHLIN: It doesn't matter for that\nplaintiff if they sell it to a poor -- somebody\nunexpected. For example, Fannie Mae just publicly, a\ncouple of weeks ago, found out they bought $300 million\nworth of bonds, and they -- they found out about a fraud.\nThey sold it and got fined by the Government because they\nheard about the fraud and sold it back into the market to\nrecoup their losses or back through their broker. That's\n-- that's not okay. That's just one outrageous example.\nBut somebody ends up with that stock that's\ninflated. Okay? And when you make the purchase. We\nagree we have to show the inflation come out before\nrecovery, and -- and 90 percent of the time --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to show what before\nrecovery? You have to show?\nMR. COUGHLIN: The inflation came out of the\nstock. In other words, if you pay $100 for a stock that's\nworth $50, it's inflated by $50. You don't recover that\n$50 until you show that $50 inflation came out of the\nstock.\nIt can come out a number of ways. Let's say,\nfor example, that somebody announced a competitive\nproduct. Well, that would take some of the inflation.\nThat would be a market factor that would take some of the\ninflation out of your false statement that you had a\nproduct, the AlSpiros product. There are different ways\ninflation can come out besides a corrective disclosure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if you've got to show\nthe inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of\naction the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss.\nI mean, if you've got to show the -- the drop following\nthe inflation, you don't have the complete cause of action\nif there's no drop the day after you buy the stock.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what they're saying.\nMR. COUGHLIN: You can only recover --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To me your -- your --\nMR. COUGHLIN: You can only recover if that\ninflation is taken out of the stock. Those are\nrecoverable damages under Ninth Circuit law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I -- I thought you were\nconceding that you -- you, in fact, do not have a -- a\nloss -- forget what you can recover -- that you don't have\na loss until the inflation is followed by a drop. And if\nthere's no drop at the -- at time of purchase plus 1\nminute, then I don't see how there is even the element of\na cause of action.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I -- I believe that the day you\noverpay something, just like in the Sigafus, just in the\n-- in the Bolles case, both of them had to do with gold\nmines --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then you're talking about a\ncause of action without damages.\nMR. COUGHLIN: You may not have recoverable\ndamages. That is true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you have no damages, you\nhave no cause -- I mean, on normal tort theory, you have\nno cause of action.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I understand, and I think you\nhave $50 worth of damages right there. And our concern is\nwhat you have to prove --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's exactly what\nwe're debating, I suppose, that very point. And -- and\nit's hard to justify, under this statute, finding a cause\nof action before there's any damage or if there isn't any.\nThat's -- that's just very hard to understand.\nMR. COUGHLIN: In the most complex frauds, a --\na company is reporting revenue and earnings and their\nstock is, let's say, trading at $60 a share. Perhaps,\nbecause of fraud, it's overstated by $30. There are\npeople in the market buying that stock at $60. That\ncompany starts to lower those expectations.\nThis happens to be a real world example,\nWorldcom. They say we're going to miss revenues by $172\nmillion. The stock starts dropping down. The inflation\nthat was in that stock because of what they lied about\nstarts coming out. Nobody knows there's fraud. Nobody\nunderstands that. In fact, it's not until that stock goes\ndown at 80 cents that there was an admission of fraud.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But then you're not\nsaying what I think Justice Scalia and I actually thought\nyou were going to say which is that the minute he pays $60\nfor a stock that should be worth $30 but is $60 because of\nthe lie, at that instant he suffered a loss. After\nlistening to you, I now think you're saying -- but I'm not\nsure because I've heard you say things that are -- both --\nI now think you're saying, no, he has not suffered a loss\nuntil later on when that $30 comes out of the price of the\nstock.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's worrying me too.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It might come out in many\ndifferent ways. It could come out because he announces\nI'm a liar.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It could come out because he\ndoesn't say anything but it sort of oozes out as earning\nreports come in, but it has to come out.\nNow, if you're saying that, then I find what\nyou're saying consistent what I think Judge Posner said.\nAnd that's really what I'm interested in because I read\nwhat he said. It seemed to me right. Now --\nMR. COUGHLIN: I certainly don't want to be\ndisagreeing with Judge Posner. So I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COUGHLIN: The other --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think you're -- I\nthink you're agreeing with the petitioners. I think this\n-- this whole thing is a great misunderstanding. You --\nyou didn't --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COUGHLIN: I would agree with that, Your\nHonor. That's just -- we come to the same conclusion.\nThere is no doubt about that. We come to the same\nconclusion. We have to prove that that inflation was in\nthere when we prove it. And what we're talking about is\nwhat the burden is going to be on us at the pleading, and\nthat's what we're concerned about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: When we have this happy\nagreement and if you'll agree, you at least have to prove\nwhat you -- you have to plead what you intend to do, that\nis, you have to plead and there was a loss and this is my\ntheory. I would like to know -- maybe we won't get beyond\nthis, but in looking at this, I wondered now suppose that\nthe stock goes up in value because of extraneous things.\nCan you recover because it would have been still higher?\nMR. COUGHLIN: Justice Breyer, I think the\nGovernment says that we can recover. We believe that we\ncould recover. In other words, it didn't go up as high.\nI think it is -- as Justice Ginsburg said, it's the same\ndifference. You lost $50 whether you lost it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens with the\ntransaction causation? Because I think you'd probably say\nwith your transaction causation in the -- in the case that\nthe -- that the lie wasn't there, we wouldn't have bought\nthe stock.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you say that,\nthey come along and say, okay, you wouldn't have bought\nthe stock. I'll tell you, here's one bad thing happened.\nYou lost your $30. But there were six good things that\nhappened that you never thought of, and so the stocks were\nfour times what it would have been and you'd never have\nthose gains, just as you'd never have the losses. How\ndoes that factor?\nMR. COUGHLIN: Well, I dream to have those\nclients that gain four times, but since we don't usually\nhave those and it is the drops that we're really talking\nabout. The but-for transaction, when they say, hey, and\n-- and you buy it, and then it goes up, and then you learn\nabout the fraud -- and I'm assuming that there's no drop\nbut you can prove that the inflation was there and never\ncame out, and can you prove that it should have gone to\n$250? You know? I'd have to prove that it went to $250.\nI agree with you. You know, I would agree with you that,\nyou know, that I'd get an expert. Mr. Fischel would come\nin and testify that it should have been worth $250. And\nthat's what, you know, would happen.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a problem. Take\nthe concrete facts of this case. The bad news about --\nwhat is it? Albuterol?\nMR. COUGHLIN: AlSpiros.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. That bad news didn't\ncome out until 9 months after the end of the period that\nyou identify for your class. You say the class is April\n15th, '97 until February 24th, '98 purchases. The bad\nnews doesn't come out until November of '98. So how could\nyou possibly hook up your loss to the news that comes out\nlater?\nMR. COUGHLIN: If -- if we move to the proof\nstage, the people that purchased in the class period and\nsold before that announcement will not be able to recover\nthat 20 cent drop at the end. People who purchased during\nthe class period and held until all of the inflation was\ntaken out by either final announcement from the FDA or\nwhen they announced they were abandoning the product would\nbe able to recover from that inflation because all of the\ninflation was taken out as to AlSpiros.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I thought that you were\ntrying to pick up on the drop that seemed to be\nattributable to the other --\nMR. COUGHLIN: Product, Ceclor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, and that's what -- well,\nthere -- there are two frauds going on. The first one is\ndiscovered and the price drops substantially. And I\nthought you were trying to attribute that drop to the\nother product.\nMR. COUGHLIN: There -- there are some things in\nthat drop attributable to the other product. The sales\nforce insufficiency, as well as management integrity, and\nthere are some other things that weren't pleaded well.\nFirst of all, we were being conservative when we\npled this and we pled the rises. We pled the insider\nsales. We pled the stock offerings. And all the\nstatements were in that earlier period. They make the\nannouncement. The stock starts down, 50 percent drop.\nIt's walked down another 40 percent after that. Finally,\nyou get the FDA announcement.\nAnd we certainly could have, and -- and maybe\nshould have, taken that period out right then. The\ndistrict court ended up having problems with it. The\nNinth Circuit, in their questionings -- Judge Reinhardt\nhad problems with the -- with that. And they gave us\nleave to replead, and we told them at that time if that's\nwhat we need to do, is tie that in also, if that's a loss\nthat we intend to recover for or seek recovery for, then\nwe'll do that and we'll go back to replead. If there are\nstatute of limitations, that's a different issue, but we\ncan plead that and could have.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one of the problems for\nme is the Ninth Circuit seems to think that it has a\ntheory -- and it is the theory of your complaint -- that's\ndifferent from, say, the Third Circuit. The Ninth Circuit\nsays we recognize that the loss is you bought it at an\ninflated price, and the Ninth Circuit thinks that's\ndifferent from a circuit that says you don't have any loss\nuntil somehow the bad news comes out and there's a drop in\nprice as a result.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I wish that the circuit said if\nthe bad news came out, but the Koger case and -- and\nemergent out of the Second Circuit seem a little stronger\nand talk about almost the only way it can happen is with a\ncorrective disclosure. And that's -- and that's a concern\nof ours.\nThe Ninth Circuit law is pretty clear, is very\nclear actually, with the three cases, Blackie, Green,\nJudge Sneed in the Green v. Occidental case, and the Wool\ncase, saying that the loss occurs at the time of purchase\nand overpayment, but recoverable damages --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that may be clear but\nit may be clearly wrong.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COUGHLIN: That -- it -- it -- I understand\nthat, Your Honor. I'm hoping that it's not clearly wrong.\nIt's been on the books for 30 years. It was the law. It\nwas the law on the books at the time that this was\ncodified. There was no real or perceived conflict in the\ncircuits at the time this was codified.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I thought that\nJudge Sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before\nany loss was incurred, even if there's been a\nmisrepresentation, recovery should be denied.\nMR. COUGHLIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nMR. COUGHLIN: That's absolutely correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not what the Ninth\nCircuit said in this case.\nMR. COUGHLIN: The Ninth Circuit didn't -- it\ncited -- it cited the Green v. Occidental opinion and the\nBlackie I believe.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm submitting it cited it\nfor the wrong conclusion.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I -- I think it -- I think it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It cited -- I thought cited\nKnapp and -- which, in turn, cited Gray or -- or --\nMR. COUGHLIN: There are all the appendants.\nThere's -- there's the three that started off. Knapp is\nthe ATV case that we tried, and that was Judge Wallace and\nhe relied on Gray. All of them are the same in that you\nhave to -- to get by the pleading stage, that you have to\nplead the inflation and identify the causes for it. It's\nfor proof and expert testimony and discovery to see if you\nhave recoverable damages.\nIf this Court were to say, no, we want\nidentifiable drops, then we could do that. You know, if\nthis Court were to say, listen, you've got to identify the\ndrops, whether they -- whether you can connect them up to\nthe fraud at this time, we want a full theory in the\ncomplaint -- and we can do that. If that's what the -- if\nthat's what this Court directs us to do, then we'll do\nthat and we'll put in all the losses, as well as the\nrises, as well as identifying the causes. You know, we'll\ndo that in -- in the complaints.\nSometimes what -- what we're saying and where we\ndiffer a little bit from the Government is it's hard to\nnecessarily tie one of those innocuous disclosures that\nmay be taking the inflation out back to the\nmisrepresentation, and yet the stock is dropping and\ninflation is coming out. And that's what we're worried\nabout. And there are other market forces that may take it\nout. So at the pleading stage, we're worried about the\nburden that almost puts us in -- in the position of having\nan expert come in, and we think that's for a later time\nfor summary judgment or trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you're worried about\nit, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as\nearlier? I mean, if that's going to be a problem, we\nshould know it sooner rather than later, rather than --\nyou know. If you say that's terribly difficult to prove,\nwe can hardly ever prove it, well, good. Then let's get\nrid of this -- rid of the case earlier.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I don't think I said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't know why --\nwhy it's desirable not to include that at the pleading\nstage.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I don't think I said that that\nwas difficult or hard to prove. I said it was difficult\nor hard to plead. It is difficult and hard to plead, and\n-- and to tie that -- those inflationary things back up\nbecause you only get to recover -- you only get to recover\nfor things that took the inflation out. I mean, if the\nstock drops -- let's say -- let's say the stock drops $60\nor $50, and where he paid $60, it drops down to $10. But\nhalf of that -- half of that drop is unrelated to the\nfraud absolutely. Well, under a 10(b) cause of action,\nyou don't get to recover for that market loss. We have to\ntie -- that's why Judge Sneed in Occidental -- in Green v.\nOccidental tied it right to the overpayment because Judge\nSneed was worried about -- about the issuers being\ninsurers for the market.\nIn other words, if the stock -- if -- if a down\nmarket takes the stock way past what you paid over\ninflation, defendants should not be liable for the whole\nmarket loss as they might in a section 33 case. And\nthat's really what the -- what the point is, to fix the\nloss.\nThat's why Judge Sneed fixed the loss at the\ndate of overpayment because Judge Sneed didn't want\nsomebody coming in and saying, hey, you paid $60 for a\nstock that was really worth $30. When you brought suit,\nthe stock was down at $10. Do you get to pay -- do you\nget $50? And Judge Sneed said no. You only get the\noverpayment on the date.\nAdmittedly in up or down markets, what\npetitioners and the Government would suggest might move\nthe damages up or down. In an up market -- you know,\nwe're talking about something that was going down here.\nIn an up market, you might get a bigger drop.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's why the term loss\ncausation is used because under the statute it's -- it's a\nloss experienced by the plaintiff caused by the\nmisrepresentation.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Justice O'Connor, I -- I couldn't\nagree more, and that's why it goes to proof. It says this\nis a proof statute --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I agree. It has to be alleged.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The Government said you don't\nwant unnecessary discovery. You have to put out pleadings\nthat make clear what your theory is --\nMR. COUGHLIN: There's no doubt.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- which yours don't do.\nMR. COUGHLIN: They don't do well enough in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what -- it seems to me\nthat what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this. You\ncannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by\nthe fraud in question. In theory, that limit is\nestablished by the inflation at the time you purchase. So\nthat is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow\nfrom that that you have anything to recover for until you\nhave your actual loss if you're pleading a -- a fraud-on-\nthe-market theory. Isn't that fair to say?\nMR. COUGHLIN: That's fair to say.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I agree with that, Your Honor.\nThat is -- that's exactly what -- that's exactly what\nJudge Sneed did. And when we were talking about this\nstatute here, it talks about us proving those -- that loss\ncausation and tying it to the actual omissions.\nAnd it follows two sections that deal with\npleading, material -- deal with particularized pleading as\nto falsity and as to scienter. And this statute says that\nif you don't plead one or two with the particularity\nrequired, then the complaint shall be dismissed.\nThis section here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand what -- I'm -- I'm really coming to believe\nthat this is a misunderstanding. It seems to me you're\nnow saying that the loss does not occur when you make the\npurchase. It is just that that is the limit on your loss,\nthe difference between what the stock would have cost you\nhad the -- the absence of gold been known and what you\nactually paid.\nMR. COUGHLIN: It's the limit on your loss.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that is not your loss.\nYou're saying now the loss has to occur later when the\nprice goes down and you're thereby harmed. Is that it?\nMR. COUGHLIN: No. I apologize if I haven't\nbeen clear. The loss occurs at the time you purchase, but\nyou cannot recover any portion of the loss until the\ninflation is taken out.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- let's approach it a\ndifferent way. On a fraud-on-the-market theory, there are\ntwo facts I think that can be assumed. Number one, there\nwas no misrepresentation that was made peculiarly to you.\nThe misrepresentation was to the broad market and was\nreflected in the broad market price.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Number two, you as a purchaser\ndo not know about the fraud until the market finds out\nabout the fraud.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that is the case, then I\ndon't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about\nyour having a cause of action the day after you purchase\nbefore the market has found out and before the fraud is\nknown. I mean, this -- this strikes me as an exercise in\n-- in an inconsistent theory.\nMR. COUGHLIN: And here's why it matters, if I\nmight, is that what petitioners and perhaps the Government\nwould say is that you're right. You don't find out about\nthe fraud until the whole market finds out. But before\nyou find out about the fraud, there can be terrific drops\nin the stock, which we think we could prove are related to\nthe fraud. Okay? Because we've had certainly a market\nloss to what we paid. The stock has dropped down. We\ndon't know about fraud yet. All of a sudden, there's a\ndisclosure of fraud, and we all learn about it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know about it, but\nthe market knows about it. That's -- that's why the stock\nhas gone down.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Not necessarily, Your Honor. In\nother words, you can lower expectations by lower revenue\nnumbers. Other market forces like a competitor coming out\nwith a product. There are other things that can lower\nthat. I'm sorry. And when it gets down there, the rule\nthat we fear is being urged is that you only get the drop\nfrom either the admission of the fraud or the full\ndisclosure of the fraud, and in the complex cases, the\nEnrons, the Worldcoms, the Healthsouths of the world, that\ndidn't happen even until long after they were in\nbankruptcy. And if we only get the drop, the $3 drop at\nthe end, or the 80 cents to 50 cents that the Government\njust returned $750 million to in the Worldcom, with every\nlarge institution in the country already out of that\nstock, well, then those that were sought to be protected\nby the Reform Act aren't.\nWe have to be able to plead certainly -- and --\nand we can -- the -- the market moving down. And then\nthat's at the pleading stage, a plain 8(a) statement. And\nthen we have to prove and tie that back up to get damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that's what\nthe Government was getting at in the passage I read\nearlier where they don't make it -- there must be a\nstatement by the issuer of the correction. They have more\nleeway.\nBut you -- the Ninth Circuit -- the litany that\nit's using, the -- the set of cases -- for example,\nplaintiffs were harmed when they paid more for the stock\nthan it was worth. The -- the notion that's repeated,\nthat your loss is established on the day you purchase the\nprice, that's just wrong, and I think we would have to at\na minimum say that.\nMR. COUGHLIN: I -- I don't agree with that,\nYour Honor. I agree with the Ninth Circuit that you\nsuffer the loss of overpayment. You have something in\nyour hand that's worth half as much as its true value.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you seem --\nMR. COUGHLIN: Can you recover? Is it like the\nUCC where you've got to mitigate your damages? You cannot\nrecover those damages even though you've suffered them.\nYou have a stock certificate that's worth half of what\nit's worth even in an efficient market. And when the\ntruth comes out, that's true, you'll be damaged, and if\nyou sell it before then, you get no recovery.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't -- aren't you --\naren't you, in -- in effect, equating two different\nthings: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs\nimmediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on\nthe other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable\nto the fraud? Those are two different things. I\nunderstand the limit on the loss. I don't understand the\n-- the suffering of the loss in fact.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthat's an interesting statement because if the limit is --\nlet's say for a $100 stock that's worth $50 and you\noverpay by $50, let's say that's the limit of our loss,\neven if the stock --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- Mr. Coughlin, I'm\nafraid you've had a full opportunity to explain this very\ndifficult case. You'll have to -- your time is up.\nMR. COUGHLIN: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Sullivan, you have 2\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOne point I think I want to focus upon for the\n-- for the Court is -- is the comment in the Senate report\nwhich said that the damages had to be a result of the\ncause -- the -- the misrepresentation, not other factors.\nI think what we've just heard about, in terms of the\ndecline in the market value, is -- is a look at a number\nof the other factors. And there are disclosures that are\nrelated to fraud and there are disclosures that are not\nrelated to fraud. And if there was a misrepresentation in\nthe marketplace, that -- that is one thing. If a new\ncompetitor comes out with a new product, that's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the problem here? He --\nI mean, well, you heard what he said. And it sounded to\nme that he agrees with you he has to prove that in fact\nthe fraud not only led to the overpayment, but that also\nlater on the client who bought the stock lost money\nbecause the market went down, and that default, which cost\nhim the money, is caused by the fraud.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: When it comes out, it just\ncomes out in subtle ways as well as direct ways.\nNow, do you agree with that? If they -- if you\ndo, it seems to me there's no case here.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I would -- I would agree with you\nand -- and I would just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where do you disagree?\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- I would just add -- I don't\ndisagree. I would add that the cause is not by other\nfactors because I think when we heard the discussion about\nthe -- the reduction of inflation, we were hearing about\nfactors other than that.\nI just want to close by saying the loss\ncausation codification in the Reform Act was meaningful\nand was part of the Reform Act. And that really indicates\nthat this is a pleading standard that we -- we -- we're\ndealing with, that the cause of action for a securities\nfraud has to be stated at the time. And that's consistent\nwith what the Reform Act was trying to achieve which is to\ngive the defendants a chance to respond and actually have\nthe motion to dismiss serve as a meaningful screen in\ndealing with those cases.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.\n"
