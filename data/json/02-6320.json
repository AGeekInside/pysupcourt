WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnlike the two cases in which you heard\nargument yesterday, and unlike Oregon v. Elstad, the\noriginal inculpatory statement in this case was\nelicited not merely in violation of a prophylactic\nrule, but of the Constitution itself, specifically\nthe Sixth Amendment right of an accused to the\nassistance of counsel throughout his criminal\nprosecution, a right designed to protect equality in\nthe adversarial process by a --\nQUESTION: What is your authority, Mr.\nWaxman, for saying that this is different from the\nMiranda warnings in the sense that it's -- it's an\nimmediate violation rather than something --\nsomething like Miranda?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it's -- Your Honor, I\nguess I have a two-fold answer. First of all, the --\nthe constitutional right involved is the Sixth\nAmendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth\nAmendment right of self-incrimination. And in -- in\nOregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court\nrecognized that although the Fifth Amendment\nself-incrimination right is not completed until the\nstatement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the\nprimary illegality, as this Court has used the\nphrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the\nElstad rule doesn't apply where the primary\nillegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct.\nAnd here, this Court has not formally\ndecided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at\nthe time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement\nis deliberately elicited, or only when the statement\nor fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides\nrehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting\nstatements in different opinions.\nWe rely on the cases cited in footnote 5\non page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of\nthis case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in\nElstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in\nChavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation\nis incomplete at the time a confession is coerced,\nnonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be\nsuppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless\nthe Government carries its burden to prove sufficient\nattenuation of taint. And therefore, even if the\nconduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his\ninculpatory statement at a time when the officers\nknew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew\nthat he had a right to the advice of counsel, the\nfruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to\nbe suppressed. That's a rule that this Court has\napplied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and\nSixth Amendment cases.\nQUESTION: Do police officers generally\nknow this distinction, that when an indictment has\nbeen handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in\nthe case as well as the Fifth? There's an element of\nfiction to it in that the person doesn't have a\nlawyer yet. As a bright line rule, I guess, we need\nsome point to know when proceedings have commenced,\nbut I - I still think there's an element of fiction\nin it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\ndon't -- I don't think I would call it fiction. I'm\nno more able to -- to testify than the member of this\nCourt would be as to exactly what training the police\nare told. But this Court has long established, long\nmaintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright\nlines. It is specific to the offense and it begins\nonly when, but when, the state makes the unilateral\ndetermination to change its formal relationship with\nan individual from one in which the individual may or\nmay not be under investigation, but the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, you -- you're\nmaking a -- a very technical distinction, if I\nunderstand you correctly. If we focus on the suspect\nin the case of no indictment yet, who has been\narrested, and the person who has been indicted and\nthen arrested, and they're both alone with the same\npolice officers in the same jail cell, and they're\nboth subjected to the same interrogation. Why should\nthe derivative evidence rule apply to the one or not\nthe other? If we're talking about constitutional\nrights, it seems to me that these two individuals are\nsimilarly situated.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, they -- they aren't,\nYour Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of\ntechnicality or formality. It is a matter of\nformalism, but the two different amendments -- the\nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,\nand the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of\ncounsel throughout criminal prosecution, protect very\ndifferent things. The first protects voluntariness,\nand the second protects the right of someone as to\nwhom the Government has formally set its face and\ninvoked a formal adversarial process.\nQUESTION: The point is why -- why should\nthat make a difference other than the convenience of\nthe bright line? As in Justice Ginsburg's\nhypothetical, it could be the same drug ring, the\nsame investigation, just the grand jury has -- hasn't\ngot around to indicting the second defendant until\nthe next day and then their rights are different.\nMR. WAXMAN: Your -- Your Honor, it's --\nit is entirely true that if the Court agrees with --\nagrees with our submission here, that the Government\ncan very easily conform its conduct simply by not\nconducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations\nprior to changing its status. But the -- the -- we\nhave to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over\nand over again to be clear about what the underlying\nright is protected in determining what the\nappropriate remedy is.\nAnd the right here is not coercion. The\nright here is not just addressed at police. It's\naddressed at the prosecution. And there is a\ndifference. You may call it technical, but it is in\nfact the hallmark of our adversary system that once\nthe Government decides to invoke a formal adversary\nprocess, it proceeds on the supposition that each\nside deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and\nB, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will\nprevent each side, and in particularly the defendant,\nfrom, as this Court has explained in -- from\nconviction resulting from his own ignorance of his\nlegal and constitutional rights, and that's what's\nbeing protected.\nThe unindicted individual, as to whom the\nGovernment may be conducting an investigation,\ndoesn't have that formal right, but once the\nGovernment invokes our adversarial system, it invokes\na set of protections that protect, not an\nindividual's right to be protected from coercion or\ninvoluntariness -- that's protected no matter when\nthe custodial -\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how far does this\nright go, Mr. Waxman? Are you -- are you saying that\npolice officers can't talk to someone who has been\nindicted?\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh no, of course not. Your\nHonor has made clear for the - in his opinion for the\nCourt in Patterson v. Illinois -- I believe it was\nYour Honor -- in any event, the Court made clear in\nPatterson v. Illinois that the Sixth Amendment right\nto the assistance of counsel doesn't prevent the\nGovernment from eliciting statements from an indicted\ndefendant. It requires that the accused either have\ncounsel or make a waiver of the right to counsel, and\nthe Court --\nQUESTION: Well, but it's - it's - I'm -\nI'm talking about a situation where, say the police\nsimply say something to a -- an indicted defendant.\nThere's no violation of a right there, is there?\nMR. WAXMAN: There only is a violation of\na right, Your Honor, if what -- if the police\nstatements and conduct amount to what this Court has\ndeemed deliberate elicitation. That is, that what\nthe Court has said in a half a dozen cases is that\nthe Government may not do without counsel is\ndeliberately elicit incriminating statements in the\nabsence of his lawyer.\nQUESTION: And you think that's what\nhappened here?\nMR. WAXMAN: I am -- I am absolutely\ncertain that that's what happened here, and the --\nQUESTION: That was the finding of the\nmagistrate and the --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. The magistrate who\nheard that police officers, Justice O'Connor, found\nspecifically that officers --\nQUESTION: He found deliberate eliciting\nof the comments at the first statement?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. He said it was, quote,\ndesigned to elicit a response -- I'm quoting from\npage 103 of the joint appendix --\nQUESTION: Is that a factual finding or --\nMR. WAXMAN: It is.\nQUESTION: -- or a legal conclusion? I\nmean, it seems to me he can -- he can find as a fact\nwhat the officer said, but whether it constitutes\ndeliberate elicitation within the meaning of our - of\nour opinion, it seems to me, is a legal question.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it's - I think, Your\nHonor, Justice Scalia, it's -- this is a mixed\nquestion of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and\nThompson v. Keohane. But because --\nQUESTION: And the Eighth -- the Eighth\nCircuit said, the Eighth Circuit is the closest court\nto this one, and I thought that the Eighth Circuit\nsaid, and that it's a threshold question in this\ncase, that it wasn't anything like interrogation, and\nthat that's -- wasn't that the -- the --\nMR. WAXMAN: The Eighth --\nQUESTION: -- prime ground of the Eighth\nCircuit?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth\nCircuit -- two judges, the majority, the panel in the\nEighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't\ninterrogation. The concurring judge --\nQUESTION: But wouldn't we have to answer\nthat --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- pointed out, Judge Riley\npointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike\nthe Fifth, interrogation is not the standard. The\nstandard is deliberate elicitation, or, as this Court\nhas also phrased it, whether the prosecution, quote,\nintentionally creates a situation likely to induce\nthe accused to make incriminating statements without\nthe advise of counsel.\nQUESTION: I thought the Eighth Circuit's\nposition was that all this was was the police\ninforming the defendant that he had been charged with\nthis and this crime.\nMR. WAXMAN: That is -- the -- the -- I\ndon't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such\nfinding, but the magistrate who heard the two\nofficers testify and evaluated their credibility made\na determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed\nquestion of fact and law. The inquiry under the\nSixth Amendment, deliberate elicitation or\nintentional creation of a situation, or purposeful\nconduct, which are the words this Court has used,\ninvolve a determination, among other things, about\nthe credibility of what the officers said.\nAnd when the magistrate concluded that\nthey -- that their conduct was designed to elicit a\nresponse, and that it was not made for any purpose\nother than to get a response --\nQUESTION: Well, was - was there any\ndebate or controversy about what they in fact said?\nMR. WAXMAN: There was no debate about\nwhat they said, but -- but there was a credibility\nfinding made by the magistrate, because the --\nQUESTION: If there was -- if there was no\nfactual dispute, why - why did -- why was credibility\ninvolved?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, when you have -- when\nyou -- because there is a subjective intent here, the\nsubjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he\ncame to the house knowing that this man had been\nindicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you\nyour involvement with methamphetamine and your\ninvolvement with four individuals.\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why should\nsubjective intent make any difference here? I mean,\nthe -- the effect on the -- on the accused is exactly\nthe same.\nMR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, I'm -- I'm simply\nreciting back for -- for you the court's\ninstructions, and -- and saying that if the standard\nis deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating\na situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a\nline, it proscribes what the police may not\ndeliberately do, and --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- but deliberateness, I\nthink, is a finding of the magistrate, which -- to\nwhich the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe\ndeference.\nQUESTION: But deliberateness may refer to\nnothing more than intending the statement that was\nmade, and whether it elicits or not, or whether it\nconstitutes elicitation -- what a terrible word --\nwhether it constitutes elicitation, it seems to me,\ncan be judged objectively, can't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, perhaps, but\ndesigned to elicit, it strikes me as including a\nsubjective component. But even if I'm wrong, I\nsubmit that the magistrate was correct as an a priori\nmatter in saying, look, these people -- these\nofficers -- these agents of the prosecution, came to\nthis man's house. They not only knew he had been\nindicted, Officer Bliemeyer had been the witness --\nQUESTION: Bliemeister, I think.\nMR. WAXMAN: Bliemeister -- had been the\nwitness before the grand jury, and he comes --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, I -- I will\nassume that that is correct. I mean, I -- the record\nlooks to me just as you're describing it. But\nassuming that, do you think there is any practical\ndifference between what Deputy Bliemeister did here\nand what the officer did in Elstad?\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't remember what the\nofficer did in Elstad.\nQUESTION: Well, in -- in Elstad, the --\nthere were two officers, one went with the mother of\nthe suspect into the kitchen to tell her why they\nwere there. The other one -- excuse me -- stayed in\nanother room with the -- with the boy who was the\nsuspect and started telling them what they were there\nto -- to investigate, there was a burglary next door.\nAnd at the end of the conversation that's quoted in\nthe opinion he said, you know, I -- I think you may\nknow something about that, and the boy said, yes he\ndid. And it seems to me that the elicitation there\nwas functionally about the same as the elicitation\nhere.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, that --\nQUESTION: But I want to know whether you\nagree.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I actually don't agree.\nI think -- I think for other reasons, that is, the --\nthe fact that this is a Sixth Amendment it doesn't\nmatter. But I do think --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- when the police officers\ncome and say, we are here to discuss with you the\nfollowing things, which happened to be the precise\nthings that he has just been indicted for, that is a\nparadigm -- paradigmatic deliberate elicitation.\nQUESTION: Well, yeah, but --\nMR. WAXMAN: And --\nQUESTION: -- to -- to say to a kid, you\nknow, I think you may know something about this, and\nthe person making that statement's a cop, sounds like\nelicitation to me.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, if -- if -- Mr. --\nQUESTION: Functionally -- if -- if\nfunctionally it is, let's assume -- I -- I tend to\nthink it is -- and -- and functionally in each case,\nwhether it's Fifth Amendment right or Sixth Amendment\nright, the statement doesn't come in unless there is,\namong other things, a voluntary waiver of the right\nto the presence of counsel then and there. And in --\nin each case we didn't have it. It's hard for me to\nsee why in functional terms it should make a\ndifference whether we're talking about Sixth or Fifth\nand why there should be a difference between this\ncase and Elstad.\nMR. WAXMAN: Because the functional\nanalysis depends on the right being protected. The\nFifth Amendment right does not embed a policy against\ndeliberate elicitation of information from suspects.\nIn fact, our system embraces that. And if there was\na violation in Elstad, it was --\nQUESTION: Well, neither does the Sixth.\nThe -- what the Sixth says is, before you try\nanything like that, you've either got to have his\ncounsel present or his counsel permission or his\nwaiver of it. What's the difference?\nMR. WAXMAN: It -- the difference is\nwhat's being protected. What's being protected in\nthe Fifth is coercion. What's being protected in the\nSixth in this instance is precisely what --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Waxman, isn't it also\ntrue that in one case there was an indictment, in the\nother there wasn't?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, yes. And what the\nSixth Amendment protects in terms, Justice Souter, is\nthat in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\nenjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.\nQUESTION: And -- and recognize he's got\nthat right because there was the indictment. And in\nthe Fifth Amendment case, the Miranda case, we\nrecognized that he's got that right, because this\nCourt has said that's the only way you're going to\nmake the Fifth Amendment work. So we start with the\nassumption that he's got the right, and that in fact\nthe elicitation or statements that produce his\nstatement are -- are -- are improper. His statement\nis inadmissible unless there's a waiver of the right\nto the presence of counsel at that time.\nMR. WAXMAN: Absolutely. And that gets us\nright to Elstad, and the line that this Court drew in\nElstad at the very outset of its opinion, which is\nthat the consequences of an interrogation in\nviolation of Miranda differ importantly from the\nconsequences of a violation of the Constitution\nitself, that is, primary illegality that goes\ndirectly, without prophylaxis, to what the\nConstitution proscribes. And this Court said over\nand over and over again in Elstad that we will not\napply a derivative evidence rule where the violation\nis only the former, but we will apply it in the\nlatter.\nAnd that is the key distinction in this\ncase. The distinction is not that the statements\nthat they elicited from Mr. Fellers at his home\ndidn't also violate Miranda, if he was in custody and\nthe court found that he was, they did.\nQUESTION: But most of our Miranda cases,\nwe recognize that the -- the police nationwide\nunderstand the dynamics of Miranda. I have no\nempirical basis, and apparently you don't know\neither. My assumption is most police officers would\nbe very surprised if there's a difference between\nFifth and Sixth --\nMR. WAXMAN: But --\nQUESTION: -- their Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment obligations in -- in this -- in these\ncircumstances.\nMR. WAXMAN: But Justice Kennedy, I submit\nto you that it doesn't matter as a matter of\nconstitutional prophylaxis. It may very well -- what\nthe police officers know is, they knew they had to\ngive him his Miranda warnings there. That we can be\nsure of. And they also knew that there would be\nconsequences for not doing it, and this is not just\nthe police. If it -- if it please the Court, this is\nthe prosecution. Once there is an indictment, the\npolice are not acting on their own. The police are\npart of the government prosecution, and if police\ndon't know that, and are trying to game the system\nthe way we heard it yesterday, it's the burden of the\nprosecution -- the prosecution and the Government to\nmake sure that they do understand that.\nWhat we're talking about here is the\npreservation of -- as this Court has said it --\nequality -- equality of each side once the Government\nunilaterally define -- changes its posture with\nrespect to someone so that that person is accused,\nand when it does that, it has to make -- it has to\ntake steps to avoid interfering with the ability of\nthe defendant at all critical stages and all\nconfrontations to proceed based on ignorance or\nmisapprehension of his rights or the legal\nconsequences.\nI realize this sounds like --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, can I -- Mr.\nWaxman, can I just clarify that we do have the\nthreshold question in this case, right? Because as\nit stands in the Eighth Circuit, you don't even have\na foot in the door because there was no\ninterrogation, it was only -- so we have to overturn\nthe Eighth Circuit on that point before we get to\nwhat you're now talking about.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the --\nthe Eighth Circuit was incorrect, because it applied\nthe wrong standard. It asked whether there was\ninterrogation, when this Court made clear in Rhode\nIsland v. Innis that that is not the test under the\nSixth Amendment for good reasons, and in any event,\nthis was the, quote, functional equivalent of\ninterrogation. I mean --\nQUESTION: Well, because of the Eighth\nCircuit's position on the original statements, it\nreally didn't address the subsequent jailhouse\nstatements in any proper fashion, did it?\nMR. WAXMAN: No. It -- it said -- what\nthe Eighth Circuit said is, look, we don't think that\nthere was a primary illegality, and therefore, we\ndon't have to discuss --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- what the fruits\nconsequences are.\nQUESTION: So I suppose -- if we were to\nagree with you on the first statements and conclude\nthey were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand,\nI suppose --\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- on the second question.\nMR. WAXMAN: Because the question\npresented in the petition, the second question\npresented in the petition is, okay, assuming that\nthere was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the\nfirst interrogation, does the invocation, the mere\ninvocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?\nQUESTION: No, it wasn't that --\nQUESTION: Well, except the Eighth Circuit\ndidn't address that second question.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Well, would you like to say\nsomething about it --\nMR. WAXMAN: I would.\nQUESTION: -- because I -- in looking at\nit, I want -- would like you to address the\nparticular argument. First, the questioning at the\nhouse was about whether he'd ever participated in\ntaking drugs with these people. The relevant\nquestion was whether he distributed drugs at the\nstation. They did ask him if he wanted a lawyer. He\ndid consciously waive it. And therefore, in fact,\nsince this case is about a right to a lawyer, maybe\nif he'd had a lawyer it would have made a difference,\nbut it's hard to see how the decision not to have the\nlawyer flowed from the first.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: So they're different subject\nmatters. Time passes and it's pretty attenuated to\nsay that that first violation led him to the second.\nAll right. Those are the arguments, et cetera.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay.\nQUESTION: What do you say?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'll -- I'll answer Justice\nO'Connor's question first and then your question.\nJustice O'Connor, the -- the -- the point here is\nthat this Court has uniformly held that where there\nis conduct that constitutes primary illegality in\nviolation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments,\nnot just a prophylactic rule, but the constitutional\nrequirement itself, the remedy is, you apply the\nderivative evidence rule, which puts the burden on\nthe Government to prove that the taint has\nsufficiently attenuated.\nQUESTION: But certainly the -- the -- the\ndefendant can waive his right to counsel later on,\nand he did.\nMR. WAXMAN: He absolutely can. And our\ncase doesn't --\nQUESTION: And he did.\nMR. WAXMAN: He --\nQUESTION: Do you think it's tainted\nsimply because if we find a violation originally?\nMR. WAXMAN: Our -- our case, Your Honor,\ndoesn't depend on any argument or showing that the\nsecond statement was either involuntary or that the\nwaiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and\nintelligent. Our submission is that the second\nstatement is the fruit of the poisonous tree, just as\nif it were a piece of inanimate evidence. There's\nnothing wrong if somebody said -- with what the -- if\npolice going and finding the body in the Nix case,\nthe Christian burial case, but it's tainted because\nthey got the -- that information derived from a\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment. I had not up here\n--\nQUESTION: But he can certainly waive his\nSixth Amendment right later. I just don't understand\nwhy what you say necessarily follows. We've never\nheld that squarely, have we?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, you -- you have never\nheld in a Sixth Amendment --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. WAXMAN: You've never held the -- the\nprecise question that's presented here for sure. But\nyou have held that where there is conduct that\nviolates the Sixth Amendment, this is Nix and Wade,\nthe fruits of that conduct, regardless of what\nhappens thereafter, are excludable as fruit of the\npoisonous tree, unless the Government shoulders its\ntaint-attenuation burden.\nAnd you have also held in a variety of\ncases that, starting with Wong Sun, that where the\nfruit is testimonial evidence, it too has to be\nexcluded with the understanding that the administer\n-- the intervening administration of Miranda warnings\nare potent evidence, but they are not sufficient in\nand of themselves to establish taint attenuation.\nYou said it in Brown. You said it last term in Kaupp\nv. Texas. You've said it in Dunaway and any number\nof other cases.\nQUESTION: How is the second statement the\nfruit of the first?\nMR. WAXMAN: The first statement in the\nfirst -- I mean, as a -- that -- this is a sort of a\ncommon sense, practical analysis, but in the first\nstatement he was -- he acknowledged that he had used\nmethamphetamines and he had associated with the four\nindividuals that the police officer named. And you,\nJustice Breyer, the indictment was conspiracy to\npossess methamphetamines with intent to distribute\nand to distribute. He made very inculpatory\nstatements.\nThirty minutes later, he executes a\nMiranda warning -- waiver -- in the station house,\nand he is asked, okay, tell us more about this\npossession and tell us person by person about your\nassociation with those four people. They then go on\nand ask more questions about other people, but in\nthis case, the link between the two is as direct as\none can possibly imagine. I mean, this Court has\nestablished a -- has long recognized a presumption\nthat where the -- when the Government acquires\nevidence in violation of the Constitution, any\nsubstantially similar evidence obtained by the police\nsubsequent to that derives from it unless the\nGovernment can prove it doesn't. That was waived.\nQUESTION: I can under -- I can understand\nthe position, although I'm not entirely persuaded by\nit, that where -- when you are violate -- have\nviolated the Fifth Amendment and gotten a confession\nthat's already on the table, the second confession is\nsort of the fruit of that, because the person thinks,\nwhat the heck, I've already confessed, I may as well\n-- that's the argument that it's the fruit.\nMR. WAXMAN: The taint --\nQUESTION: But I don't -- but I don't see\nhow the waiver of -- of counsel the second time is\nthe -- is the fruit of the improper approach the\nfirst time. I mean, I -- I don't see somebody\nsaying, what the heck, I waived counsel the first\ntime, I may as well waive it the second.\nMR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, the taint --\nQUESTION: That doesn't follow the way --\nthe way confession does.\nMR. WAXMAN: The taint, which this Court\nin Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said\nwas insufficient -- IIb -- was insufficient to prove\ninvoluntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that\nthere is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the\nlink, and that is the accepted, common sense\nproposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom\nthe Government deliberately elicits an unwarned,\nincriminatory statement after it institutes\nadversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to\nbelieve that there is little to be gained and much to\nbe lost from attempting to avoid further\nincrimination.\nQUESTION: Well, now, but is there -- is\nthere some authority for that specific proposition\nthat you just said?\nMR. WAXMAN: This Court recognized it in\nBayer, in Brown, in --\nQUESTION: Did it say -- I -- I'm -- you --\nyou just recited kind of a litany. Did the Court\nrecite that sort of a litany in Bayer?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, in Brown, for example,\nit said that the second warrant statement, quote, was\nclearly the result and fruit of the first. The fact\nthat Brown had made one statement believed by him to\nbe admissible bolstered the pressures for him to give\nthe second, or at least vitiated any incentive on his\npart to avoid self-incrimination.\nQUESTION: But that -- that's a -- that's\na first statement. That's -- you're -- you're\ntalking here about a waiver of counsel and you're\nsaying that's the same thing.\nMR. WAXMAN: It is the same thing. In\nthat case they were talking about the second\nstatement, which was preceded by a waiver of counsel,\nand making not the, Your Honor, not the legal\njudgment that the second statement was there for\ncoerced or involuntary, but the practical -- what\nthis Court has described as the psychological and\npractical disadvantage of having confessed a first\ntime can be regarded as a fruit of the first.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but isn't the -- the --\nisn't the -- correct me if I'm wrong. I think your\ntheory is that the waiver itself is likely to be a\nfruit because a person is going to say, I've already\nlet the cat out of the bag, what do I need a lawyer\nfor. Is -- is --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. That's -- as --\nQUESTION: -- that your position?\nMR. WAXMAN: -- as -- as Justice Harlan\nstated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a\nconcurrence, but I think is sort of the --\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that's -- the\ncat out of the bag is what we rejected in Elstad.\nMR. WAXMAN: You rejected it, Your Honor,\nas evidence or as constituting or -- or eliciting a\npresumption of involuntariness. But you did it only\nafter -- in part IIa of your opinion in Elstad, you\nsaid, derivative evidence rule doesn't apply. Fruits\nare not going to be excluded from Elstad -- from a\nMiranda violation. Now, the Court said in part IIb,\nnow we have to deal with the contention that he says\nit's involuntary, and his only evidence that it's\ninvoluntary is that it was the cat out of the bag and\nthere was this psychological compulsion.\nThat's too attenuated and hypothetical to\nconstitute a presumption of compulsion, but it is\nprecisely what this Court has recognized in Brown and\nDunaway and Bayer and Taylor and Harrison as being a\npsychological fact --\nQUESTION: And that should make the case\n-- that case that we heard yesterday easier than this\none if that's the standard, because there, the first\nunwarned set of questions was much more intense, much\nmore detailed than in this case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right. And the -- the only\nburden in the -- in the case yesterday that I don't\nhave is that the primary illegality was a violation\nof Miranda, and not of the Fifth Amendment\nprohibition against coerced confessions itself.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nOn the central legal issue in this case,\nthe critical fact is that, at the jailhouse, after\npetitioner was transported from his home, petitioner\nreceived a full set of Miranda warnings, which\napprised him of his right to counsel, and knowingly,\nvoluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to\ncounsel.\nQUESTION: Did the Eighth Circuit ever\ndecide whether there was a knowing and voluntary\nwaiver at the jailhouse?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. I believe that the\nEighth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, because the\nEighth Circuit applied Oregon v. Elstad to reject\nwhat appears to be a Miranda-style argument that\npetitioner made in addition to his Sixth Amendment\nargument.\nQUESTION: I thought that perhaps since\nthey didn't think the first statement posed a problem\nthat they never really got to the crux of the\njailhouse inquiry.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think in -- in\npart, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion\nis correct. The court did say that under Patterson,\nthe Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is\nmaking in this Court doesn't get out of the starting\ngate, because there was no interrogation, it used the\nword interrogation. There was an issue about whether\ninterrogation is equivalent to deliberate\nelicitation, and I'll try to address that.\nBut before the court got to the Sixth\nAmendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 122\nof the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad,\nand the argument that the petitioner made was that\nthe statements made at the jailhouse should be\nsuppressed -- and this is on page 121 of the joint\nappendix -- because the primary taint of the\nimproperly elicited statements made at his home was\nnot removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights\nat the jail.\nAnd then the court went on to discuss\nOregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding,\nthat argument. And the way that I interpret that\npassage is that the court affirmed the district\ncourt's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and\nintelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that\nclaim.\nQUESTION: Just so I understand what the\nSixth Amendment rule is, if the Sixth Amendment\nprohibits the state from eliciting statements when\nthe defend -- when proceedings have begun, outside\npresence of counsel, is it wrong for them to give the\nMiranda warning and if he's then silent, then go\nahead and say, now you've had your Miranda warning,\nwould you like to talk to us? Is that consistent\nwith the Sixth Amendment rules that we impose? That\nis to say, can you elicit the statement after you've\ngiven the waiver, consistently with the Sixth\nAmendment right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. Patterson v. Illinois\nspecifically addressed the question of what does it\ntake for officers to obtain a waiver of counsel. The\nonly point where I would disagree, Justice Kennedy,\nwith your summary is that presence of counsel is not\nrequired. The defendant has the right to choose\nwhether to have or to waive counsel.\nAnd in Patterson, the Court held that the\nMiranda warnings conveyed to a suspect who has been\nindicted all of the information needed to make a\nknowing and a voluntary and intelligent waiver of\ncounsel in custodial interrogation. That's what\npetitioner got.\nQUESTION: And they can attempt to elicit\nthat waiver consistently with the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. They can\napproach the defendant, apprise him of his rights,\nand if the defendant then makes a knowing and\nintelligent waiver of his rights --\nQUESTION: No, that wasn't my question.\nCan they -- can they advise him of those rights, he's\nsilent, and then try to elicit the statement? Say,\nnow we've apprised you of your rights and we want you\nto talk to us. Is that consistent with the Sixth\nAmendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think so, if that's\nconstrued as seeking a waiver of his right to\ncounsel. Of course, there has to be a finding that\nthere was in fact a waiver of the right to counsel.\nThe police officers can't simply read Miranda\nwarnings, provide no interruption whatsoever to make\nsure that the defendant actually understood them, and\nthen barge right ahead.\nNow, there are cases where the courts have\nto decide whether there was an implicit waiver of\ncase like that, because the Miranda waiver form in\nthe record clearly indicates --\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Dreeben, maybe I'm\nwrong on the facts, but you're relying on the waiver\nat the station house?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that prior to that\nwaiver there had already been a violation of the\nSixth Amendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Stevens. Our --\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then you don't\nneed the waiver.\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that is true. I --\nmy submission is on the critical legal question.\nEven if the Court finds against us on what I would\nacknowledge is a close question about whether the\ninteraction at the home constituted deliberate\nelicitation under the Sixth Amendment --\nQUESTION: Assume it was deliberate\nelicitation. Would you say it was a violation then?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I wouldn't say that it\nwas a -- an actual violation of the Sixth Amendment\nat the time. The Sixth Amendment is a trial right.\nThe right to counsel has to be evaluated by reference\n--\nQUESTION: So even if there was no waiver\nat the home, there -- there still was no violation of\nthe Constitution?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not at that time. I -- I\nwant to make it perfectly clear, Justice Stevens --\nQUESTION: It seems to me a rather extreme\nposition.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I don't think it\nis extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with\nwhat I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can\nthe police simply go to an indicted suspect's home,\nignore his right to counsel, and engage in\nquestioning? And the answer is, generally no,\nsometimes yes. The generally no is that once the\ndefendant has been indicted, the right to counsel\nprovides a -- a direction to the police not to\ninterfere with or circumvent the right to counsel.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the sometimes\nyes?\nMR. DREEBEN: Sometimes yes is that, this\nCourt has recognized in its seminal case in this\narea, the Massiah case, and then again in Maine v.\nMoulton, that the Sixth Amendment, as it is\noffense-specific, does not preclude the police from\ninvestigating ongoing criminal activity that's not\ncharged.\nQUESTION: Well, but this is -- this was\nan offense-specific interrogation if it -- if was an\ninterrogation.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. I -- and this case\ndoesn't involve the --\nQUESTION: It seems to me there's an\nanalogy to civil cases here. Supposing you just had\na civil lawsuit pending against the person and after\nit's filed, wouldn't there be an ethical obligation\non -- on behalf of the plaintiff not to send agents\nout to question your adversary in the proceeding?\nMR. DREEBEN: There may be a ethical\nobligation, even if the party is not known to be\nrepresented at the time, although --\nQUESTION: If he's known not to be\nrepresented, that's my case.\nMR. DREEBEN: He's known not be\nrepresented, I think it's a closer question whether\n-- whether the ethics rules would -- would bar the\napproaching of the defendant. But this Court has\nmade --\nQUESTION: Who -- who -- who would you go\nto? If he hasn't appointed counsel and --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens --\nQUESTION: -- and he's filed the case --\nhe's filed the case pro se. Who would you approach\nif you don't approach him?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Stevens --\nQUESTION: Now, I'm assuming that the --\nthe Government is the plaintiff in the case. That --\nMR. DREEBEN: The implication is that you\ncouldn't approach him. And this Court has clearly\nmade it evident that whatever the ethical rules might\nbe with respect to private conduct, the Sixth\nAmendment rules are not governed by them. And the\nSixth Amendment rule, in this area at least, is\nrelatively clear. The police can approach an\nunrepresented defendant, advise him of his rights,\nand obtain a waiver of the right to counsel.\nQUESTION: Well, can the police approach a\nperson and deliberately elicit statements without\nadvising him of his right to counsel after\nindictment?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not on the charged offense,\nJustice O'Connor, and have the information admitted\nat trial. The -- the threshold question --\nQUESTION: Well, have we looked to whether\nthe statement was deliberately elicited? Has that\nbeen our understanding of what we'd look to?\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that has been the\nway that this Court has formulated the test, and I\nwould suggest that if --\nQUESTION: And so should we apply that\ntest here to those early statements?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but I think the Court\nshould clearly reformulate it to make it in the\ncontext of overt interrogation by the police, known\npolice officers, to be an objective test. The\ndeliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives\nrise to some confusion, because it does suggest that\nthere's a subjective component to it, where\ndeliberate elicitation does have a different\napplication than interrogation for purposes of\nMiranda with respect to undercover agents. The Court\nhas made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the\npolice cannot use an undercover agent, not known or\nidentified as such to the defendant, to circumvent\nhis right to counsel. And in that respect,\ndeliberate elicitation is broader.\nBut in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton\nwhere the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation\nin some detail, the Court made clear that intent is\nhard to prove, and it's really not the main issue\nhere anyway. What we should be interested in is\nwhether the Government must have known that its\nconduct would be likely to elicit incriminating\nstatements, and that is essentially the same as the\nRhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation. In\nfact, it's a little bit more onerous for the\ndefendant, because it says, must have known, and the\nRhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known.\nIn any event, the Government submits that\nthe Court should make it clearer that when you're\ndealing with identified police officers interacting\nwith suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v.\nInnis standard, the objective test should be the\ndefinition of deliberate elicitation. Then the\nquestion becomes, was there deliberate elicitation on\nthe record in this case?\nWhat happened is, the officers arrived at\npetitioner's home. The officers knew petitioner.\nThis was not somebody that they had never met before.\nThey'd met him on prior occasions. And they said in\none continuous statement, we're here to discuss your\nmethamphetamine activities, we have a warrant for\nyour arrest --\nQUESTION: Didn't they say, we're here to\ndiscuss with you?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice --\nQUESTION: Wasn't it Bliemeister's\nstatement, I'm here to discuss with you?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, on three\noccasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say\nwhat he said in his own words, he said, we're here to\ndiscuss your methamphetamine activities. On one\noccasion, when defense counsel in cross-examination\nreformulated what Officer Bliemeister said, and said,\ndidn't you say you're here to discuss with petitioner\nhis methamphetamine activities, Officer Bliemeister\nanswered yes. Both the magistrate judge and the\ndistrict court did not use the with you language in\ndescribing what the officer said.\nAnd to the extent that this case turns on\na rather subtle distinction in language, I think the\ndistinction is relevant, because what the officers\nwere essentially doing is introducing the topic of\nwhat they were going to tell petitioner, namely, your\nmethamphetamine activities have landed you in\ntrouble, we're here to arrest you, we have an\nindictment for your arrest. And then petitioner\nbegan to speak primarily --\nQUESTION: Telling -- telling is not\ndiscussing. I mean, I don't see why the phrase, with\nyou, is essential when the only person in the room is\n-- is -- is you --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and somebody comes in and\nsays, I'm here to discuss, you know, whatever. Who\nelse are you going to discuss it with then?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think there was any\nambiguity about the object of the statements, but the\nquestion of what the officers were intending to do is\nsomewhat informed by the way they phrased it.\nQUESTION: No, but the -- the usual sense\nof the word discuss is something that involves other\nthan -- something involving more than a monologue.\nSo I mean, I -- as Justice Scalia said, I -- it might\nmake it clearer if he had said with you each time,\nbut without the with you, discuss implies give and\ntake.\nQUESTION: At -- at least if there's nobody\nelse in the room. I mean, if there's a crowd of\npeople and you say, I'm here to discuss something,\nmaybe you're going to discuss it with the other\npeople. That's fine, but -- but it -- this was\none-one-one.\nMR. DREEBEN: I readily acknowledge that\nthis is a case that could be reasonably decided more\nthan one way, but I would submit that if you look at\nwhat the officers did, the officers in the -- at his\nhome, basically informed him about the fact that he\nwas under arrest and indicted. He spoke\nuninterrupted except by one completely irrelevant\nquestion to the topic of the indictment, until the\nofficers interrupted him, cut him off, and said it's\ntime to go, John, you know. And John said, can I\nplease get some shoes on? And they accompanied him\ndownstairs, he got shoes, then they took him down to\nthe jailhouse. No questions about the topics that\nwere later discussed at the jailhouse.\nQUESTION: Well, if we were to conclude\nthat there was a violation of the so-called\ndeliberate elicitation standard, modified or not,\nthen what, with regard to the subsequent conversation\nof the jail, after the warnings had been given?\nMR. DREEBEN: Then I think, Justice\nO'Connor, that this Court should apply its rule in\nOregon v. Elstad that the knowing, voluntary, and\nintelligent waiver of the right to counsel\nconstitutes an independent act of free will that\nbreaks any causal link that might otherwise have been\nposited between the statements that were made in the\ninitial unwarned session --\nQUESTION: And you think that that\ndetermination has been made knowing and voluntariness\nas to the jailhouse statement --\nMR. DREEBEN: I --\nQUESTION: -- by the court below.\nMR. DREEBEN: Not only do I think that it\nwas made explicitly in the district court and\nimplicitly in the court of appeals, but I don't\nbelieve that petitioner contests it. I don't believe\nthat petitioner's position is that the waiver of\nrights was actually tainted. What I understand\npetitioner's position to be is that there was a\nviolation of a primary constitutional norm at home\nwhen -- when petitioner was interrogated or\nstatements were deliberately elicited. Accordingly\n--\nQUESTION: The fruits --\nMR. DREEBEN: Exactly. The same fruits\nrule ought to apply that applies under the Fourth\nAmendment and then petitioner relies on Fourth\nAmendment precedents, which the Government does not\nthink are -- are applicable here.\nQUESTION: I - I think -- I think he would\nsay it is a fruit because it is not totally\nvoluntary, given the fact that he had already let the\ncat out of the bag. I -- I -- I don't think -- I\ndon't think he would acknowledge that the second\nwaiver -- that the waiver of counsel in the second\ninterrogation was entirely free, given what had\npreceded.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I'll\nhave to let petitioner's briefs speak for what --\nQUESTION: Well, we -- we've destroyed his\nright of rebuttal, so --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And that's the question\nbasically, because I think that's an important\nquestion and -- and the question is whether there is\na right to a lawyer, and when the Government violates\nthe right to the lawyer, like the Fourth Amendment or\nany other amendment, they can't use a fruit. Now,\nOregon v. Elstad is talking about a right that isn't\ncomplete until you fail to introduce the -- until you\nuse it as testimony at trial, and therefore Oregon v.\nElstad is a different, and considerably more lenient\ntest. I confess I always would have thought until\nthis moment that our Court cases said you apply the\nfruits because the violation is complete.\nNow, it seems to me in advocating the\nsecond, you're advocating a considerable change, but\nwhether it's a change or not a change, I want to know\nthe reason for it.\nMR. DREEBEN: There are two critical\nreasons, Justice Breyer, why Oregon v. Elstad should\napply in this context. The first is that the right\nthat the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at\nhome, was the right to make an informed waiver of the\nright to counsel. When the defendant got the Miranda\nwarnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in\nknowledge that the defendant previously had about his\nright to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of\nfree will that broke any causal link between the\nfirst statements and the second statements.\nAnd the second crucial reason why Elstad\nshould apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to\nreasoning that is only applicable in the context of\ncompulsion under the Fifth Amendment. It also\nclearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative\nand attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at\none time is therefore going to believe that the cat\nis out of the bag and I should speak again, I don't\nreally have a choice.\nQUESTION: Right. But as to the first, my\nConstitution says you have a right to a lawyer, not\n-- of course you can waive it, like anybody -- other\nright. But that's quite different than the Fifth\nAmendment right, which is a right not to testify\nagainst yourself, which is in complete to a trial.\nAs to the second, of course, attenuation\nis relevant. It's relevant under the tree -- fruits\ndoctrine. It's relevant under Elstad. So if you\nprove attenuation, fine. So, given those two things,\nwhy do we have to change the law here? Or is it a\nchange?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think it's a\nchange, Justice Breyer, because the Court has never\naddressed the specific dynamic involved in this case\nunder the Sixth Amendment of a defendant who makes an\nunwarned statement --\nQUESTION: Well, the Nix v. Williams case\nbears on it to some extent, doesn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It does --\nQUESTION: That was a Sixth Amendment\ncase.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I\n-- I accept, although I think it's fair to say that\nNix did no more than assume that there would be a\nfruits rule as to physical evidence.\nQUESTION: Yeah. And the Court in Nix\nmade it pretty clear that we assumed there would be a\nfruits suppression.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. As to physical\nevidence.\nQUESTION: But applied some other reason\nto let the body --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court -- the Court\nthere relied on inevitable discovery.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: Here, our basic position is\nthat the voluntary testimony of the defendant himself\nis different from physical fruits or from the\nsituation involving a tainted line-up, which was\ninvolved in Wade, and that the decision, made\nvoluntarily and intelligently by a defendant to waive\ncounsel, is a per se break in any causal chain that\nwould be positive.\nAnd our second argument is that the Court\nhas already rejected in Elstad the idea that there is\na causal link between a defendant's letting a cat out\nof the bag in the first statement and then being\nconfronted with the question whether to waive his\nrights in the second.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, do -- do I\nunderstand correctly that essentially you are saying\nthat Mr. Waxman in wrong in bracketing the Sixth\nAmendment with the Fourth Amendment, that it belongs\nwith the Fifth Amendment? And one, it seems to me,\nlarge difference between the two of you is Mr. Waxman\ndescribes the Sixth Amendment violation of -- as\noccurring on the spot. You have said in your brief\nit's just like the Fifth Amendment. It's sort of\ninchoate until the Government seeks to introduce it\nat a trial. Is that still your view, so that the --\nthe right to counsel isn't complete -- the violation\nisn't complete until the Government makes an effort\nto introduce it at trial?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is. My view that the\nviolation is not complete until the evidence is\nintroduced at trial, but I think where I put the\nSixth Amendment is not numerically accurate, but it's\nsomewhere in between the Fourth and the Fifth\nAmendment rules, in that there are circumstances in\nwhich I believe that there is a fruits rule attached\nto conduct that infringes a Sixth Amendment norm.\nThe right itself may not be a completed violation\nuntil evidence that results from infringing a Sixth\nAmendment norm is actually used against the\ndefendant. Adversarial fairness is the goal of the\nSixth Amendment. If it is not infringed, neither is\nthe Constitution.\nQUESTION: Because if -- if the -- we\ndescribe that right, that Sixth Amendment amendment\nright as a right to counsel at every critical stage\nin the criminal proceeding, then that sounds like\nthere's a critical stage and you haven't been told\nand haven't waived your right to a lawyer, the\nviolation is complete.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so,\nJustice Ginsburg. And one example that I think makes\nthe point very clear is this Court's ineffective\nassistance of counsel cases. Those cases require not\nonly that a lawyer performs deficiently, below any\nreasonable professional standard, but also that there\nbe an effect on the fairness of the trail in the form\nof prejudice. It's a two-part standard. There is no\nconstitutional violation merely by interfering with\nthe right to counsel. Another case that makes that\npoint --\nQUESTION: Well, there's a constitutional\ndeficiency. I mean, we're playing with words. What\nwe're saying in the counsel cases is, if we have to\ngo back and unring the bell, we want something more\nthan simply the deficiency. We want to know that\nrequiring a new trial or whatever is likely to make a\ndifference.\nThe question here is -- is asked, I think,\nJustice Ginsburg's question is asked on a prospective\nbasis. And that is, at the time the -- the police\nquestion without counsel, is that a violation of the\n-- of the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: And my --\nQUESTION: Your -- your answer a moment\nago was, the only violation of the Sixth Amendment\nwas the denial of the -- of the opportunity to waive.\nBut he's got to have an opportunity to waive\nsomething, and I suppose that implies that he has, at\nleast on a prospective basis, a right to the presence\nof counsel there if the police are going to question\nhim, absent a -- a waiver.\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- I think that there's a\nlot in your question, Justice Souter, but I -- I\nthink I basically agree with the thrust of it. He\ndoes have the right to choose whether to have counsel\nor not after he's been indicted when the police\napproach him for interrogation. The question in this\ncase is, what do you do if that didn't happen? And\n--\nQUESTION: Of course, the -- the other way\nto look at is upside down. I mean, if -- if you\nconcede that there's a Sixth Amendment violation\nimmediately, you're still free to argue that -- that\nin -- in the Miranda case, there's also a Fifth\nAmendment violation immediately. Now, you couldn't\ndo that with Elstad, but after Dickerson, you can\ncertainly argue that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, as we discussed\nyesterday, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: Yes, I know.\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- I believe that the\nviolation in a Miranda case consists precisely of the\nadmission of the defendant's statements in the\nGovernment case in chief. The Fifth Amendment is an\nevidentiary rule. That's what the nature of the\nviolation is. It's not a conduct-based rule.\nQUESTION: Well, and that has a textual\nsupport in the constitutional language itself.\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: But you don't have quite the\nsame thing on the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but I don't think that\nit matters because we're conceding that the Court\nengages in fruits analysis. Our primary position in\nthis case on the legal issue is that the defendant's\nindependent, untainted decision to waive counsel is a\nact of --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Dreeben, it's -- the\nthought runs through my mind that if he were to waive\ncounsel in front of a judge in a trial setting, the\njudge would ask him a lot of questions and be sure\nthe waiver was intelligent and voluntary and so\nforth. And you're suggesting, at the time he's first\nindicted when the police approach him, he doesn't\nneed any of that guidance as all. If he just answers\nthe question, that's sufficient.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is --\nQUESTION: It's a rather dramatic\ndifference in the kind of waiver of this very\nimportant right.\nMR. DREEBEN: True. But that's what the\nCourt held over Your Honor's dissent in Patterson v.\nIllinois. The Court explicitly considered the issue\nof what kind of a waiver is necessary, and the Court\nheld that the issuance of Miranda warnings provides\nthe defendant with all the information that he needs\nto know.\nQUESTION: But, of course, you didn't even\nhave the Miranda warning here --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but --\nQUESTION: -- at the home.\nMR. DREEBEN: And we're not claiming that\nthere was a waiver of the right to counsel. Our --\nour claim for whatever favor it may meet with the\nCourt is that there was no deliberate elicitation of\nstatements. We're not claiming a waiver at the home.\nWe are unequivocally claiming a waiver at the\njailhouse.\nQUESTION: Don't you think it is a rather\n-- rather strange that the judges are as careful as\nthey are in a trial setting, whereas the police can\njust do what they did here? Does that -- doesn't\ntrouble you?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think it's\nstrange at all, because as the Court explained in\nPatterson, the question of a waiver is a functional\nquestion that turns on what the role of counsel might\nbe at a particular setting. Now, the role of counsel\nat trial is considerably more complex in dealing with\nevidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in\npre-trial interrogation.\nQUESTION: Actually, in -- in a situation\nlike this, the whole outcome of the proceeding is\ndetermined by what happened in his home.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in this particular\ncase, and this is my third and final point, if the\nCourt should determine that the waiver of rights is\nnot a per se independent act that attenuates any\ntaint, on any record the Court should not find that\nthere is any taint that is unattenuated. The\nviolation at home, if there was any, was an extremely\nmild violation. If the defendant let the cat out of\nthe bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire\ncat.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: The -- the defendant barely\nspoke at all about his activities relating to the\ncharges that were identified in the indictment. He\nsaid that he had business and personal problems and\nhe was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for\na while until the police cut him off. At the station\nhouse, he was asked specifically person by person\nwhat his relationship was with the individual and\nwhat the activities were, and of course, he gave more\nelaborate information at that time, but -- and this\nis critical too. It was not information that\nadmitted the charges in the indictment. This wasn't\na case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed\nonce, I might as well confess again now that I have\nmy Miranda warning. This was an individual who spoke\nabout his problems at his home, then he gets down to\nthe station house and he's essentially talking about\nall the things that make him not liable, criminally\nliable under the indictment.\nIt was an instance in which, I would\nsubmit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not\nthat the cat was out of the bag, but that he was\nhoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and\npersuade the officers that the indictment was not\nproperly founded.\nAnd finally, of course, the officers never\nexploited any prior statement and they did give him a\nthorough, complete administration of Miranda\nwarnings, and under the circumstances of this case,\neven if the Court were to apply a taint analysis\nsometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis\napplies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough\nattenuation so that the jailhouse statements should\nbe admitted, while the statements at home were\nsuppressed.\nQUESTION: Are -- are you arguing that the\nfruits rule does not apply, or are you arguing that\nthis is not the fruits?\nMR. DREEBEN: I am arguing that a fruits\nrule applies under the Sixth Amendment. I'm\nconceding that by virtue of the Court's assumption in\nNix v. Williams and its holding in United States v.\nWade. But the case of a defendant's own voluntary\nstatements should be treated as a special case under\na fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in\nthe form of an independent act of free will that\nintervenes between the violation and the ensuing\nwaiver. And that comes about when the defendant\nreceives full and complete information about his\nrights. There is no suggestion of involuntariness in\nhis waiver and he decides to speak.\nThe ultimate test in attenuation law is\nwas there an independent act of free will when you're\nspeaking of a confession that breaks the causal link\nto the prior illegality.
