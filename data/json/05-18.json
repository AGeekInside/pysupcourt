        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst in Arlington Central School District Board of\nEducation v. Murphy.\nMr. Kuntz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KUNTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe statute awarding attorneys' fees as part\nof the costs to the prevailing parents provides a clear\nrule, imposes a certain obligation. It should not be\nexpanded to include fees for expert witnesses.\nThis is a case of statutory construction.\nUnder longstanding rules, statutes are construed by\nfirst looking at the words of the statute. Is the\nmeaning plain? If so, the inquiry stops there.\nThis statute is unambiguous. Expert fees are\nnot a part of attorneys' fees. Expert fees are not\ncosts. The statute contains no reference to expert\nfees. They are not shifted to the school district when\nthe parents prevail.\nIt's our belief that the lack of compensation\nfor experts is an intentional exclusion and omission\nfrom the statute. Congress knows how to add expert\nfees in a cost-shifting statute, and that omission is\ntelling here.\nIn that context, I think it's important to\ndraw the Court's attention to the origin of the\nstatute. It was in response to this Court's decision\nin Smith against Robinson. At the time that Smith\nagainst Robinson was heard, the EHA was often grafted\nonto other causes of action as a pleading device to --\nin an attempt to ensure that attorneys' fees flowed to\nthe prevailing party at the conclusion of the case. So\ncases were brought not only under the -- the Education\nfor All Handicapped Children Act, but also under 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and under 1983 as well\nof -- on the theory that these were equal protection\nclaims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment. In\nSmith against Robinson, this Court made it clear that\nthe avenue that had to be followed by the parents was\nexclusively that of -- of the remedy provided under the\nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act.\nIn response to that decision of the Court, as\nmy opponent points out in his brief -- I think it was\n19 days later -- bills were introduced into Congress to\nremedy what Congress at that point saw was a -- a lack\nof coverage for fees for attorneys for the prevailing\nparties in cases under the -- under the act. So it's\nno -- no great surprise that what Congress did in that\ninstance was to take the language that appears in\nsection 1988 and, in effect, lift it and put it into\nthe -- into the act, into what we now call the IDEA.\nAnd it's very clear that in doing so, it\nlimited the right of recovery to attorneys' fees, and\nthat right does not include the expert fees advocated\nby the Respondents here this morning.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think the right\nincludes any costs other than statutory costs, any\nexpenses?\nMR. KUNTZ: No, it does not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do you explain the\nreference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief which\nquotes from the -- a section of the statute authorizing\na report to be made, a report authorized under? They\nshall include data about the specific amount of\nattorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. Why do you\nsuppose they put the word expenses in?\nMR. KUNTZ: Well, it said attorneys' fees,\ncosts, and expenses.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. KUNTZ: And it's a direction to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the expenses must be\nsomething other than attorneys' fees or costs.\nMR. KUNTZ: Well, they could be expenses of\nthe attorney. But if they were to be -- be set aside\nseparately, that's no indication that -- that Congress\nintended that expenses of other individuals be shifted\nto the cost -- shifted, rather, to the school district.\nIt's a direction to the GAO to acquire data --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. KUNTZ: -- for future reference by -- by\nCongress.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about -- may I\njust take the question one step further? I think it's\nin a subsequent clause in that same section requiring\nthe GAO report that it refers to the -- the -- I forget\nwhether -- the expenses of consultants. Why was the\nword consultant in there? Because as -- as I\nunderstand it, a consultant would not be covered by the\ncosts -- the general costs statute.\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I believe that's\ncorrect. That's in -- in subdivision (B).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it? Is it? I thought\nthe -- there was a reference to hours of consultants,\nbut not expenses.\nMR. KUNTZ: There are two subdivisions:\nsubdivision (A) and subdivision (B). Subdivision (A)\nsays attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses -- expenses,\nand in subdivision (B), it refers to consultants. But\nthere isn't any --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I would have thought\nthat your answer would be that the Congress was\ninterested in finding out the cost of this act, and\nit's very clear that school districts hire consultants\nto assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to\nknow the amount they were paying to the consultants.\nAnd that's also why it used the word personnel, which\n-- which is a word usually reserved for a government\nagency.\nMR. KUNTZ: I -- I believe Your Honor is\ncorrect in that it -- it's a direction by the GAO to\nacquire data. And I believe we argued that point in\nour brief, just as Your Honor has expressed it. We\nthink that that direction to the GAO, however, does not\nrelate back particularly and -- and certainly doesn't\ninform this Court or inform the statute that expert's\nfees are to be included and shifted over to the -- to\nthe school district.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But does it make it possible\nto read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to\ndo that, but I guess you could read it to do that,\ncouldn't you? I mean, you said the word cost wasn't\nambiguous.\nMR. KUNTZ: Under this statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you might be right,\nmaybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong? How is\nit not ambiguous? It might cover -- it might cover the\nfees of consultants. It might be that the argument you\nmade is right, but it also mightn't.\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I think this Court\nhas looked at that issue in -- in two separate cases,\nand one of those cases is Crawford Fitting and the\nother is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which involved this statute?\nMR. KUNTZ: Well, it didn't involve this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, I mean, we\nhave a statute and they're using the word costs in the\nstatute, and whatever they used in some other statute\nthey might have meant something different in this\nstatute. And my question is simply how do we know they\ndidn't by just reading the word five times,\nparticularly since, in fact, if you look at another\npart of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost\nto include number of hours spent by personnel,\nincluding consultants, and the expenses incurred. I\nmean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says\nthe word costs couldn't include that?\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, it -- it could, but I\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, once you say it could,\nthen possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress\nMembers were actually thinking, and as soon as we look\nat what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly\nclear. Isn't it? Because both the conference report\nand the Senate report say absolutely clearly that they\nintended this kind of expense to be used, which is why\nthe GAO went out and did all the studies to include it.\nMR. KUNTZ: But we come back to the\nhistorical derivation of how this statute came into --\ninto being, and it did come in in response to Smith\nagainst Robinson.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the GAO study\nincluded not just the -- the hours worked and the --\nthe costs, however you choose to define it, on the part\nof the parent challenging the school board action, but\nit also included those hours and those costs expended\nby the school.\nMR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor, it does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In which case it could not\npossibly have been directed to what items are\ncompensable.\nMR. KUNTZ: We think that's a separate\nsection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On its face, it covers at\nleast half of the items that are not compensable.\nMR. KUNTZ: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's true, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that the\nprovision I referred to refers to the specific amount\nof attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the\nprevailing party? So it's definitely referring to\nexpenses incurred by the -- by the plaintiff. Isn't\nthat true?\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KUNTZ: But I think there are expenses\nthat -- that the attorney bears in -- in the routine of\na -- of a -- of handling the client. Those are\nexpenses --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying the word\nexpenses should refer only to expenses incurred by\ncounsel, which of course would be normally\nreimbursable.\nMR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm not -- I'm\nnot sure that you don't have a further answer to\nJustice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B).\n(3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the\nprevailing party. (3)(B) says, for the same sample the\nnumber of hours spent.\nMR. KUNTZ: They're talking about -- the same\nsample refers to a -- a designated number of States, a\nrepresentative number of States. So the sample refers\nto the States surveyed, not to those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's certainly possible.\nI just wonder why don't we look and see what they\nintended, since they told us. In the conference\nreport, they say the conferees intend the phrase,\nattorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable\nexpenses and fees of expert witnesses and the\nreasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is\nfound to be necessary for the preparation of a parent\nor guardian's case in the action or proceeding. So why\nare we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress\nintended when they told us what they intended?\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I don't think it's so\nmuch a question of metaphysics or philosophy -- maybe\nperhaps of philosophy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is why don't we\njust look and see what they intended since they wrote\nit down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is\nread it?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did Congress say that, Mr.\nKuntz?\nMR. KUNTZ: No, Congress didn't say that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it did. I thought\nthat the conferees in Congress wrote in the conference\nreport precisely what they intended.\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, if I might respond to\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'd like you to respond\nto it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KUNTZ: It's -- it's a longstanding rule\nof statutory construction that Congress' intent is best\nfound in the language that Congress actually puts into\nthe statute. And as we pointed out in the brief, there\nwere previous versions of this act which included\nexperts' fees which did not make its way to the final\nversion approved by both the -- the Senate and the\nHouse.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There's no doubt that the\nbest evidence is the text of the statute, but at least\nthe people who drafted this, even if they were not the\nconferees themselves but were just staff members, they\napparently thought the language was subject to that\nreading.\nMR. KUNTZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which would mean it would\nbe ambiguous, wouldn't it?\nMR. KUNTZ: The rule that we look first to\nthe -- yes, Your Honor. Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The rule that you refer to\nthat you cannot look at legislative history -- of\ncourse, we always start with the plain language.\nThat's clear. But the rule that you cannot look at\nlegislative history didn't really get any emphasis till\nafter 1987, and this statute was enacted in 1986.\nMR. KUNTZ: But that -- in -- in the\nretrospective view that the Court looked at in -- in\nthe -- the Casey decision, it went back and it traced\nthe origin of a number of -- of statutes and looked\nessentially to similar language, and it found that\nexperts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and\nit found that experts' fees were not a part of -- of\ncosts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also found that\nthere were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't\nJustice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on\nfor a couple of pages, including footnotes? I think it\nwas over 30 that did mention experts. It mentioned\nattorneys' fees and expert fees.\nMR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor, and to us that\nproves that Congress knows how to distinguish between\nexperts' fees and attorneys' fees when it wants to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was this language, by the\nway -- I'm not clear. It always cited to the House --\nthe House conferees. Was -- was this language in the\n-- in the Senate conference report?\nMR. KUNTZ: No, Your Honor, I don't believe\nit was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we don't really know --\nMR. KUNTZ: It emanates -- it emanates solely\nfrom the House conference report.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only half of\nthe Congress, isn't it? Even if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought it was a joint\nexplanatory statement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- even if everybody in the\nHouse agreed with that, which we don't really know.\nWhat about the President? When he signed it,\ndid -- did he indicate any interpretation?\nMR. KUNTZ: His -- Your Honor, the -- the\nPresident's hesitancy was about the retroactive effect of\nthe statute, and he noted that in his signing\nmemorandum, but he didn't note any other differences.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we have a committee of\none house that said -- that said that, that thought it\nmeant that or would have liked it to mean that.\nMR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor. And it isn't\nall that unusual that the congressional history of a\nparticular statute might point one way and the actual\nplain meaning point another way.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do you explain the\ntitle, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of\nthe Conference? Doesn't that speak for both the House\nand the Senate?\nMR. KUNTZ: It -- yes, Your Honor, it does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's not correct it's\njust for one house. It's -- what I have is the Joint\nExplanatory Committee, and it says the managers, on the\npart of the House and the Senate.\nMR. KUNTZ: It -- it does say that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nAnd is there some rule -- I don't know what\nthis rule is you can't refer to legislative history.\nDoes it say that in the Constitution of the United\nStates?\nMR. KUNTZ: No, Your Honor, it doesn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. And so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, sometimes\nthese joint statements are actually voted on by the\nCongress as a whole. Was this one -- was this one\nvoted on?\nMR. KUNTZ: There was no evidence of that,\nYour Honor, in our review.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which ones are voted on?\nI've not heard of that. I mean, they might be, but it\nused to be that the -- they circulate the report to all\nthe Members and the Members read it, and if a Member\ndisagrees with it, they note their dissent. Maybe it's\nchanged. But I guess --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can you cite an example of\na conference report that was voted on by the Congress?\nMR. KUNTZ: I -- I cannot, Your Honor, and\nthat's why I -- I responded as I did, which is that I\nknow of no evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we have said that\nconference reports are more valuable than the reports\nof a single house. I think we have said that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are voted on when the\n-- when the conferees make changes, which they\nsometimes do. Then -- then, of course, they have to be\nvoted on. So it's frequent. It's frequent that\nthey're voted on, but this one apparently -- there were\nno changes made and it wasn't voted on.\nMR. KUNTZ: Thank you, Your Honor. If I --\nif there are no further questions, I'd like --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Justice Breyer knows that.\nHe -- he's worked there.\nMR. KUNTZ: Oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't have an opportunity\nto work for a Senator who, in fact, to my experience\nasked me to report on a vote on such a thing. I just\nwasn't aware of it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. KUNTZ: Thank you. I'd like to reserve\nmy time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. KUNTZ: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have examples of\nconference reports being voted on, don't you?\nMR. SALMONS: I do not, Your Honor. I -- I\ndo not dispute the representations that have been made\nabout that practice.\nBut let me begin by saying, thank you, Mr.\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis Court should give the attorneys' fee\nprovision of IDEA the same construction it gave the\nnearly identical language of section 1988 in Casey and\nhold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the\ncost does not include expert fees.\nRespondent's sole argument is that expert\nfees are included in the statutory term costs, but as\nthis Court made clear in both Casey and Crawford\nFitting, the term costs in a fee-shifting statute has a\nwell-settled meaning and is a reference and is limited\nto those -- that modest category of costs that may be\nawarded under 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1821.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say\nabout expenses? Isn't -- isn't it a fairly common\npractice for a -- a trial lawyer to -- to hire his\nexperts and pay them and then bill the client for --\nfor whatever he's paid for the experts? I mean, if\nthat is the -- this has been a long time since I've\npracticed law. So maybe that isn't the way it's done\nanymore. But it -- it certainly has been done that\nway, and -- and if that is still the practice, wouldn't\nit make sense for Congress to have assumed that expenses\nwould include those kinds of expenses?\nMR. SALMONS: No. No, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. Now, first of all, just to be clear, the -- the\nfee provision that's at issue here is identical to the\nfee provision that was at issue in Casey, and it makes\nno reference to expenses. It says attorneys' fees as\npart of the costs.\nNow, in this separate section instructing the\nGAO to do a report --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's the GAO reference.\nYou're right.\nMR. SALMONS: -- it says to look at the --\nthe awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees,\ncosts, and expenses. We don't think the term expenses\nin -- in that provision can fairly be read to somehow\ndramatically expand the meaning of the phrase,\nattorneys' fees as part of the costs. We think it's\nmuch more naturally to read that as just a reference,\nas this Court noted in Casey, to the common practice of\nincluding out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys for\nthings like copying costs and -- and necessary travel\nexpenses and things like that as -- as also being\ncompensable. And so we don't think that that -- that\nterm expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning\nof the statutory provision at issue here.\nAnd as far as subsection (B) of that\nprovision related to the GAO, we think it's clear that\nit's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases,\nand is instructing the GAO to do a broader study about\nthe time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and\nothers on both sides in these cases because Congress\nwas very concerned about the amount of litigation and\nthe expense of that litigation and the diversion of\nfunds away from the core educational services of the\nschools. As this Court noted in Schaffer, that's one\nof the primary concerns Congress has had, especially in\nthe more recent amendments to the act.\nAnd we think, in fact, that the -- the fact\nthat Congress instructed the GAO to study that is, if\nanything, more consistent with the idea that Congress\ndecided not to legislate on the question of expert\nfees, but to leave it for another day after they've had\nthe benefit of that study at a minimum.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salmons, there's one\ndifference, a marked difference, between this statute\nand the others, and that is, in -- in many of these\ncases, it is the consultant that is the primary,\nperhaps exclusive, aide to the parent. There's not a\ncase where they have these determinations, a lawyer is\nin the front line. Even in this very case, wasn't it\ntrue that it was the consultant who was the aide to the\nparent and there was no lawyer on the scene?\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that is correct.\nDuring the administrative proceeding and in the -- and\nin the district court, there was no attorney here.\nBut -- but I think there's one important\nthing to keep in mind about that is that that's --\nCongress expected that that would be the result. This\nis not a statute where Congress didn't think about the\nrole of experts. Among other things, section --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you\nsay about the legislative history, which has been so\nprominent in the discussion this morning? The\nconference report.\nMR. SALMONS: Sure. Well, I think the\nconference report clearly represents the view of the\nauthor of the conference report with regard to the\nmeaning of the language.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, don't you suppose it\nrepresents the view of the House and Senate conferees?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I mean, I think -- I\nthink what that points to is the perils of -- of using\ncommittee reports and statements --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I realize that,\nbut I mean, an --\nMR. SALMONS: -- from the legislative history\nwhen the text is clear.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- an argument, a perfectly\nfair argument, can be made, whether -- whether you find\nit dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a\ncommittee report of one house cannot simply be taken as\na literal reflection of the thinking -- the -- the\nactual thinking of -- of everybody on that committee,\nlet alone a whole house.\nBut when we're talking about a conference\nreport that has been hammered out between two sets of\nconferees, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the\nconferees know exactly what is in that report and would\ntake exception to it if it didn't represent their\nviews. Isn't -- isn't that a -- a fair reason for\nsaying that whatever you may think of reports in\ngeneral, the conference report probably has a -- a\nsuperior authority?\nMR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nand let me try to explain why.\nFirst of all, this Court made clear in Casey,\ndealing with the exact same language, it took -- you\nknow, that's at issue here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The text or --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Language in the statute but\nnot in the conference report.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was there a conference\nreport in --\nMR. SALMONS: No. That's right. And I'm\nreferring to the statutory language here, that this\nCourt considered this exact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And would you agree, if the\nstatute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference\nreport?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, but my point, Your Honor,\nis that what this Court said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my\nquestion?\nMR. SALMONS: Yes. If the Court thinks the\nstatute is ambiguous, it's fair to look at the\nconference report.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And why is it not ambiguous\nif the author of the conference report read it that\nway?\nMR. SALMONS: For, among other reasons, Your\nHonor -- this is what I was trying to -- trying to\nstate because this Court in Casey, dealing with this\nexact same language, said the following. It said where\nthe statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous,\nattorneys' fees as part of the cost, that has a clearly\naccepted meaning in both legislative and judicial\npractices -- again, this Court in Casey tracked through\nthe -- the usage, the history of the usage of this\nlanguage and the way courts had responded to this over\ntime -- that when that's the case, we do not permit it\nto be expanded or contracted by the statements of\nindividual legislators or committees during the course\nof the enactment process. We think that holding in\nCasey is equally applicable here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, one thing here --\nMR. SALMONS: -- and it be would wrong to\nlook to that.\nNow, if the Court did, I think the thing that\nthe Court should take away from it, if you're going to\nlook at what Congress intended here -- and this is\nundisputably true. Everyone agrees on this. The\nprimary purpose of this legislation was to respond to\nthis Court's decision in Smith v. Robinson. And prior\nto this Court's decision in Smith, section 1988 had\nprovided the means by which courts had awarded\nattorneys' fees in cases under IDEA's predecessor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the gravamen --\nMR. SALMONS: Smith foreclosed those fees --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does the gravamen --\nwell, I'll let you finish your answer.\nMR. SALMONS: Sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the gravamen of the\nargument -- is it that this phrase is unambiguous?\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that is certainly our\nfirst argument, absolutely, Your Honor. The point I'm\nmaking now is that if you look at the context in which\nthis language was used, Smith foreclosed the award of\nsection 1988 fees. Congress responded shortly\nthereafter by -- by adding the precise language of\nsection 1988 to the language in IDEA's predecessor.\nNow, however anomalous it would normally be to give the\nsame language in two different fee provisions different\nmeanings -- and it would be quite anomalous -- to do so\nhere with section --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that at\nthe time they did that, it was well settled in cases of\nthis kind that the Court would look at the conference\nreport to ascertain the meaning of the statute? At\nthat time, in 1986.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was there any case that\nsaid you can't look at the conference report at that\ntime?\nMR. SALMONS: There are plenty of cases, Your\nHonor, that -- that point out --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- later.\nMR. SALMONS: -- that the -- that -- that\npoint out, even -- even I think beforehand, that the\nlanguage is the primary basis to look.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is the best evidence, but\nnot the sole evidence.\nMR. SALMONS: And that even when it's\nunambiguous, that's the end of the matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, even in -- in those\nbenighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we ever\nwould use the conference report when the statute was\nnot ambiguous. I thought it was always a rule that --\nthat --\nMR. SALMONS: We certainly agree with that,\nand I would just add that I'm not aware of any decision\nof this Court that would suggest that the type of\nstatutory construction tools the Court would use would\ndepend on what was in place at the time that the\nstatute was enacted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Of course --\nMR. SALMONS: I mean, this Court applies the\nrules that it thinks are appropriate at the time it\nissues its decision.\nNow --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't use red if the\nstatute says green. Green doesn't include red. I\nunderstand that. And that's why, in fact, I wondered\nif the presence in this bill of the GAO section\nsuggests in the bill itself the possibility that the\nword cost means something special. And if that's so,\nthen I would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to\nthe legislative history. It's not like using the word\nred and arguing it includes green.\nMR. SALMONS: Two responses to that, Your\nHonor. The first is that we don't think it's ambiguous\nat all, and we think when -- even if you look at the\nGAO provision, you don't get the kind of ambiguity that\nwould allow you to otherwise deviate from the -- the\nclear meaning of this language when it's -- when it's\nbeen consistent with statutory usage over time. As\nthis Court noted in Casey, more than 34 statutes use --\nexpressly state attorneys' fees in addition to expert\n-- expert fees in addition to attorneys' fees, and\nthere would be no point to those.\nBut -- but moreover, I think the important\nthing to keep in mind is that it's not just this fee\nprovision. If you want a further indication of\nCongress' intent, let me refer you to some other\nprovisions of the statute itself, again, the language\nof the statute. Among other things, section 1415(d)(2)\nexpressly details the content of the notice that has to\nbe given to the parents about the procedural safeguards\nin the act, and it's very specific. It lists 13\ndifferent things that States have to explain in full to\nthe parents. The -- the 12th and the 13th items on\nthat list are the parents' ability to bring a civil\naction and their right to bring, quote, attorneys'\nfees, no mention whatsoever of expert fees.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSalmons.\nMr. Vladeck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. VLADECK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. VLADECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Murphys' principal submission in this\ncase is that the text of IDEA authorizes courts to\naward prevailing parents the costs of the experts who\nassist them in IDEA hearings which are typically held\nbefore State administrative tribunals and in Federal\ncourt.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Vladeck, let me\njust give you a purely hypothetical situation. Let's\nsuppose that the conferees can't agree whether expert\nfees should be included. Some think they should; some\nthink they shouldn't. And somebody suggests a\ncompromise. The compromise is we won't put it in the\nstatute, but we'll put it in the report and we'll let\nthe courts figure it out.\nWhat should happen in that situation?\nMR. VLADECK: Thank you so much, Your Honor.\nI think -- I think that if the statutory text was\nclear, which -- and I believe this text is clear in the\nother direction -- I think we would lose that case.\nBut that is not this case, Your Honor, and let me\nexplain why.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if that's not\nthis case, what in the world prevented the conferees\nfrom putting something as important in this context as\nexpert fees, as I understand it, probably more\nimportant than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them\nfrom putting that in the statute if that clearly was\ntheir intent?\nMR. VLADECK: Without being flippant, Your\nHonor, I think that the conferees thought they had put\nit in the statute. Remember, this statute was passed\nback in 1986 when, at least with respect to the 99th\nCongress that enacted this provision, the word cost did\nnot have the term-of-art meaning that was later\nascribed to it in this Court's opinion in Casey.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to say it\ncertainly had the meaning in Federal -- the Federal\ncourt context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial\nCode.\nMR. VLADECK: I understand that, Your Honor,\nbut Congress thought it was adding -- that the use of the\nword cost and its breadth was a way of -- of including\nthe cost. And -- and this is important, Your Honor.\nThe language --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get past Casey,\nCasey didn't invent this as a definition. Casey said\nit has always meant this in innumerable Federal\nstatutes. Casey was relying on a longstanding practice\nwhich existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced.\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor, at the time Casey\nwas -- at the time this case was -- excuse me -- at the\ntime this statute was enacted by Congress, for example,\ncosts were routinely read to include expert fees in\ntitle VII cases, for example. So I don't disagree with\nYour Honor's point.\nI am simply saying that the lens through\nwhich this statute must be judged is the understanding\nof the 99th Congress, and every indication in the\nlegislative history here is that Congress used the word\ncost for its breadth, not as a term of art.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Vladeck, why -- if\nthat was what Congress had in mind, then how do you\nexplain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey\nthat say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?\nMR. VLADECK: My only explanation, Your\nHonor, is that the -- the Members of Congress who wrote\nthis provision were unaware of the difference this\nCourt would later ascribe to those statutes in Casey.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not later ascribe. I mean,\nCasey was relying on --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Casey -- Casey is very\nclear in saying the judicial background against which\nCongress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the\nstatutory background, and it says the judicial\nbackground was that expert fees were quite different\nthan attorneys' fees. They were not a subset of\nattorneys' fees.\nMR. VLADECK: Even -- even conceding all of\nthat, which I -- I think is -- let me take a step back.\nEven if you reject that submission, the next provision\nof the statute on which we rely is section 4 of the\nHandicapped Children's Protection Act, which was\nenacted at the same time as section 1415(i)(3)(B), and\nif you look at that provision, it is clear that\nCongress intended the word cost to have a broader\nmeaning.\nSection 4(b)(A) directs the General\nAccounting Office to study --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that set\nforth?\nMR. VLADECK: I'm sorry? That's page --\nexcuse me. Page 4 of the red brief, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMR. VLADECK: That directs the General\nAccounting Office, first, to study the amount of\nattorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the\nprevailing party. In this statute, only the parents\ncould be the awarding -- the prevailing party because,\nunlike 1988, this statute is a one-way street and\nprovides only for awards to parents.\nAnd secondly, it says that for -- for the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- Mr. Vladeck,\nmay I stop you there? Because the parents are always\nthe plaintiff. It's not the child. The parents are\nrepresenting the child.\nMR. VLADECK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So prevailing party is\nidentical to parents. The parents are the ones who\nprevail.\nMR. VLADECK: That's exactly my point, Your\nHonor. And -- and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the word\nconsultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute.\nMR. VLADECK: Right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that specifically\nrefers to the State educational agency and local\neducational agency.\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it uses personnel,\nwhich sounds to me a very odd way to talk about private\nexperts hired by an attorney. You don't talk about\nthem as personnel.\nMR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, this\nprovision, up until the last part which says, and\nexpenses incurred by the parents, the -- the last\nclause of this provision was added in the conference.\nAnd the conference report makes that clear at page 7.\nThe conference report makes it clear that the House --\nthe Senate recedes to the House bill. The GAO study\nprovision was only in the House bill, with an amendment\nexpanding the data collection requirements of the GAO\nstudy to include information recording the amount of\nfunds expended by local educational agencies and State\neducation agencies on civil actions and administrative\nproceedings. That clause was added, Your Honor, in\nconference. Prior to the conference, the provision was\nvery much the same as it is today. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Vladeck, my -- my\nproblem with the argument you're now making is -- is a\nlittle more basic. Assuming, which I think is a -- is\na major assumption, that expenses refers to expert\nfees, I don't see how it helps your case that in\nanother part of the statute, the statute says, fees,\ncosts, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that\nwe're talking about here, it only refers to fees as\npart of costs. How does it help your case that --\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that elsewhere they go\nout of their way to add and -- and expenses? It seems\nto me that hurts your case.\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthat this is an inoperative part of the statute. I\nbelieve that -- that -- this direction to GAO makes no\nsense if all Congress sought to authorize was\nattorneys' fees and the costs that are historically\navailable under section 1920 and section 1821. This\nprovision makes no sense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't it really the\npoint not that it makes no sense, but that it raises a\nquestion? It creates the question, which -- which we\nhave in mind when we say the statute is ambiguous, and\nit is in answering that question, that you then turn to\nthe legislative history, which has a pretty unequivocal\nstatement in your favor. Isn't -- isn't that the --\nthe way to analyze it?\nMR. VLADECK: I -- it certainly can be read\nthat way. I read it as more of an affirmative\nstatement by Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if you\nconclude that the statute is ambiguous, what do you do\nwith the Spending Clause problem? We've said that when\nyou're imposing conditions in Spending Clause\nlegislation, you have to do that unambiguously. It's\nwhat the Court said in -- in Pennhurst.\nMR. VLADECK: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's ambiguous, if\nthe availability of expert fees, which is the big-\nticket item in these things, not the attorneys' fees,\nStates are not unambiguously on notice that they're\naccepting that liability when they take the funds.\nMR. VLADECK: With all respect, let me\nquarrel with one of the premises in your question,\nwhich is that the -- the expenses for experts are,\nquote, a big-ticket item. If you look at page 28,\nfootnote 17 of our brief, we've tried to compile all of\nthe reported cases on the amount of expert fees that\nare awarded. They tend to be exceedingly modest, Your\nHonor. They run from a few hundred dollars to a few\nthousand dollars.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's before the\nMagna Carta you're asking for in this case which would\nestablish a whole -- a whole --\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- new profession of\nexperts.\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor, that is not the\ncase. The -- the rule that we seek to preserve has\nbeen the way courts have interpreted this provision\nsince 1988. That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even if it is\nnot the big-ticket item --\nMR. VLADECK: So -- so these are modest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it still has to be\n-- it still has to be unambiguously set forth in\nSpending Clause legislation.\nMR. VLADECK: Right. And -- and if the Court\nfinds that the legislative history adds the clarity\nthat the statute otherwise needed -- is needed, I do\nnot see why that would not comply with the Spending\nClause, particularly since, Your Honor, this statute\nhas been on the book for 20 years. There are dozens of\nopinions finding that expert fees are compensable. No\nSpending Clause argument has ever been raised in this\nkind of issue even though the statute has been on the\nbooks for 20 years.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Under your reading of 1415,\nmay a court award to parents any costs that they incur\nin connection with the litigation, or -- or would you\njust add expert fees to the attorneys' fees?\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor, there is a body of\nlaw on that issue that already exists because courts\nhave interpreted this provision since 1986. By and\nlarge, the costs that have been awarded under the\nstatute are costs that are normally associated with\nlitigation, copying costs, computer-assisted research\nwhen there's a lawyer involved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about testing? Isn't\ntesting --\nMR. VLADECK: The cost of testing and\nevaluation, which is -- which is a crucial component of\nthe statute -- those costs have been awarded.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if costs is not a term --\nis not a legal term of art, if it really -- if it means\njust the expenses that parents incur, why wouldn't it\ninclude things like travel expenses or lost wages to\nattend the court proceeding?\nMR. VLADECK: The -- the way the courts have\naddressed that issue, Your Honor, is they -- they have\nlooked to the -- the initial phrase of the statute, in\nan action or a proceeding, and have found those costs\nnot sufficiently closely enough related to the action\nor proceeding to justify an award.\nAnd also courts have applied the rule 54\nreasonableness standard in ordering costs under this\nprovision, and therefore, expert costs have been\nreduced and other costs have been reduced to meet the\ngeneral requirements of rule 54.\nI would like -- I would like to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you read the phrase\nfrom the conference report as a limitation? That is,\nthat -- we're trying to figure out what the Congress\nmeant by the phrase costs. It says it means includes\nreasonable expense and fees of expert witnesses and\nreasonable costs of any test or evaluation that's\nnecessary. So then is that -- have the courts read\nthat as a -- as a limitation?\nMR. VLADECK: Yes, Your Honor, but they've\nalso imposed limitations that are generally -- that\ngenerally constrain the awards of costs in cases. They\nhave not done what -- what I understood Justice Alito\n-- his question to -- to get to, was to use this as --\nas a broad, open door.\nI'd like to talk about the legislative\nhistory, and particularly I'd like to respond to\nJustice Scalia's comment about the conference report in\nthis case.\nThis statute was changed dramatically in\nconference. It does not reflect either the House bill\nor the Senate bill. If one reads the conference report\nin the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of\nthe Conference, which is three pages long, one will see\nthat there were dramatic and substantial changes made\nbecause there were substantial disagreements between\nthe House and the Senate, not on the question of\nreimbursement of expert costs. That -- that provision\n-- that understanding was shared on a bipartisan basis\nin both houses. But the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why were the earlier\nversions that included that expressly then not -- why\ndidn't they make it through to the final version?\nMR. VLADECK: The -- the version that -- that\nwas referred to earlier, Your Honor, came out of the\nSenate bill. The Senate bill contained a number of\nvery controversial features. It was pared down, and\nthe word cost was substituted, as the drafter of the\nlanguage made clear on the floor of the Senate before\nthe Senate voted on its version of the bill, and\nSenator Weicker's explanation of what the word cost\nmeans could not be clearer, and he -- he --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, we've slid back\nfrom the joint statement to the statement of one Member\non the floor now.\nMR. VLADECK: Well, I'm happy for you to rely\non the joint statement, Your Honor.\nMy only point is, is that the understanding\nin the House report is expert fees were included in the\nHouse bill, which referred to costs and expenses.\nSenator Weicker explains precisely the question you\nasked, which is what happened to the Senate bill. And\nSenator Weicker's explanation, which was made before\nthe Senate, immediately before the Senate voted on the\nbill, makes clear that expert costs are included.\nThen, of course, you have the bill going to\nconference. There were many changes in the bill,\nincluding the language of section 1415. Prior to the\nconference, it did not say attorneys' fees as part of\ncosts. It said attorneys' fees in addition to costs.\nThat language was changed in conference to accommodate\nthis Court's decision in Marek v. Chesny, which had to\ndo with the applicability of rule 68.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, speaking of that -- of\nthat language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as\npart of costs, does that suggest -- it doesn't say\ndirectly that costs may be awarded. Does that suggest\nthat the attorneys' fees are simply to be regarded as\nanother element of costs that -- that may be awarded\nunder the costs statute?\nMR. VLADECK: I don't believe that Congress,\nwhen it used the word costs, was adverting to section\n1920. If that is your question, I do not believe that\nthat is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then where is the\nauthorization? I think that's what Justice Alito's\nquestion goes to. You have to come up with some\nstatutory authorization to pay expert fees. Now,\nattorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any\ncosts. It just says whatever costs are otherwise\nauthorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that.\nMR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, it says --\nit's part of the cost to the parents. And unlike\nsection 1980, this language is not, contrary to the\nprevious submissions to the Court, identical to the\nlanguage in 1988. It says that a court may award\nattorneys' fees as part of the costs to parents, and\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the authorization to\npay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees?\nAll -- all this section says is they may award\nattorneys' fees as part of costs, and costs are\npresumably elsewhere authorized.\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But where is the\nauthorization to pay?\nMR. VLADECK: Under -- under that reading, no\nstatute would authorize the -- the payment of costs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under that reading, wouldn't\n-- wouldn't you have a problem in a State court?\nBecause doesn't this same provision govern in a State\ncourt, so that if the State did not have a separate\ncost statute, it would -- it would authorize nothing.\nIsn't -- isn't that the problem you'd run into.\nMR. VLADECK: That is correct.\nLet me make one last --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any State that\ndoesn't have a cost statute?\nMR. VLADECK: I have not -- I've not looked\nat them to see whether they correspond to 1920, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Vladeck, you have --\nyou referred to the section on GAO reporting --\nMR. VLADECK: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as an assist to help\nyou include consultant fees in -- in costs. But how do\nyou explain the -- the provision in this very statute\nthat says attorneys' fees can be reduced? Congress\nexplicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys'\nfees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one word\nabout reducing the costs of testing fees or consulting\nfees.\nMR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, all costs are\nsubject to the general requirement in rule 54 of\nreasonableness, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why -- then it would\nbe unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees.\nMR. VLADECK: Here's the reason, Your Honor.\nAt least, here's the reason that -- as I understand\nit. Much of the litigation in IDEA cases takes out --\ntakes place outside the confines of Federal court.\nMost of the litigation takes place in State due process\nhearings. And what I believe Congress was interested\nin making sure were the general rules, like rule 11,\nthe general rules that punish parties for engaging in\nvexatious or frivolous litigation would have some\nanalog in these proceedings.\nAnd therefore, what the court -- what -- what\nCongress did was to authorize a Federal court, in\nreviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred\nbefore a State-administered tribunal, because that's\nwhere the action takes place in these cases, to -- to\nbe able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was\nmisconduct by the parent or -- or the lawyer,\nmisconduct in the sense of trying to protract\nlitigation or multiply proceedings.\nAnd interestingly, Your Honor, the -- the\nconference report addresses this issue and does explain\n-- and now I'm quoting from page 6 of the -- of the\nconference report, the joint explanation -- that the\ncourt shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys'\nfees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they\ndetermine that this misconduct had taken place. So I\nthink that at least in the conference report, Congress\nis signaling that if there were other costs that were\nincurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers\nprotracting or delaying the proceeding, they too would be\nsubject to the same reduction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's effective too, as\nthough it were written into the statute, because one\ncommittee of Congress said so. That's effective.\nMR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, this is not\none committee of Congress. This was -- this -- the\nconference report was circulated to all Members of\nCongress before they voted on the final bill.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and they read it.\nMR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, this is the\nfinal bill they voted on, and if they turned the page\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only thing we\nknow for sure that they voted on.\nMR. VLADECK: That is correct, Your Honor,\nthough the vote technically, of course, is a vote to\napprove the conference report. That is the final vote\nCongress took on this legislation. The vote was a vote\nto approve the conference report, which contains four\npages -- three pages of text and three pages of\nexplanation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the -- did the final\nbill say we adopt the findings of the conference\nreport?\nMR. VLADECK: It did not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And other bills have said\nthat.\nMR. VLADECK: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Like in -- as in Nofstiker.\nMR. VLADECK: As far as I know, Your Honor,\nthe procedure followed here was the standard procedure\nwhen the conference report takes bills and essentially\namalgamates them or redrafts them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But was this legislation\nvetoed by the President?\nMR. VLADECK: It was not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, when the President\nsigned it, did -- did he also approve the conference\nreport? Did he have the conference report in front of\nhim?\nMR. VLADECK: I do not know that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He had the statute in front\nof him, didn't he?\nMR. VLADECK: I -- he -- my assumption, Your\nHonor, is he had this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you think he read the\nconference report too.\nMR. VLADECK: I don't believe that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. VLADECK: I'm not arguing that he did.\nMy assumption, though, is if he had the statute before\nhim, he probably had this. The President --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there any opposition?\nWas there any -- is there any history of anyone in this\nSenate or the House either before or after suggesting\nthat they didn't want to allow recovery for the expert\nfees?\nMR. VLADECK: Not at all, Your Honor. And\none of the points that I would like to make -- and I\nwould like to return to the language of 1415 -- is this\nstatute is all -- the IDEA is a statute all about\nprotecting parents and children with disabilities. One\nprovision of IDEA we have not mentioned, but I think is\nan important one, is the general guarantee that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could\ninterrupt you. As I understood it, this gets back to\nwhere you started. Your position is that if this same\nscenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986,\nthat your position would not be the same. In other\nwords, you said -- your suggestion was that it was the\nlegal context at the time in '86 that governed what\nCongress thought the effectiveness of its statements in\ncommittee reports would be. Maybe I'm ascribing one of\nthe Justice's views to you.\nMR. VLADECK: If -- if you're -- and -- and\nforgive my -- my lack of knowledge of the exact history\nof this, but if 1988 is a date upon which the Court\nbegins to be reluctant to look at legislative history,\nI would concede that my case would be different post-\n1988. It is quite clear that the Congress that enacted\nthis bill assumed, and rightly so, that this Court and\nreviewing courts would rely on legislative history.\nIndeed, when this Court issued its opinion in Casey,\nfootnote 5 of Casey says that this case may be\ndifferent because of the conference report.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what date in -- I\nmean, so we have two different modes of interpreting\nstatutes: one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative\nhistory, and one post-1988 in which we don't use\nlegislative history?\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that -- that's what\nyou're suggesting, isn't it?\nMR. VLADECK: What I am suggesting is that\nthe Court's role, as I understand it, is to be the\nfaithful agent of Congress, and if the -- if the\nexpectation of Members of Congress is that language in\ncommittee reports will -- will garner respect from the\nCourt, it is hard to then change the rules on Congress.\nThe operative question here is what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The reason one does not use\nlegislative history, if one does not use it, as I don't\n-- as I don't, is not because Congress doesn't expect\nit to be used, but because Congress does not have the\npower to delegate to one of its committees the content\nof -- of its statutes. The Constitution provides that\nlegislation will be passed by two houses and signed by\nthe President, and the problem with legislative\nhistory, for those of us who have a problem with it, is\nthis amounts to a delegation by Congress.\nIt's not a matter of what Congress expected.\nI don't care what Congress expected. It can't do it.\nIt can't leave it to a -- to a committee to -- to fill\nin the blanks in a statute. That's the problem, and\nthat has nothing to do with expectations.\nMR. VLADECK: Your Honor, my only point is\nthat the Congress that enacted this statute, the 99th\nCongress, thought -- and this -- this view is expressed\nrepeatedly in the legislative history, and I believe it\n-- it is reflected in the statutory language as well --\nthat the word costs here would be given a broad meaning\nto ensure that parents were made whole when they have\nto fight against school boards to secure that which\nIDEA guarantees their child, which is a free and\nappropriate public education.\nThis Court has repeatedly in Township of\nBurlington, in Tatrow, in Florence County said that\nprovisions of IDEA should not be interpreted in ways\nthat detract from this fundamental guarantee. There\nwould be no more clear detraction from that guarantee\nthan requiring parents to bear the expense, which for\nmany of these parents is enormous, even though Chief\nJustice, it may amount to only a few hundred or a few\nthousand dollars, to retain an expert, to do battle\nwith school boards who have experts on staff.\nEarlier this term, this Court decided\nSchaffer v. Weast. Post Schaffer, parents cannot hope\nto meet their burden of production, let alone their\nburden of proof in IDEA hearings without expert\nassistance. To force parents to bear those expenses,\neven when they prevail, will detract from IDEA's core\nguarantee that the -- that the education provided to\nthe child is both appropriate and free. Those\nprovisions are in the statute to avoid having parents\nbeing compelled to make the Hobson's choice: a free\neducation that's inappropriate or an appropriate\neducation that is not free.\nThis Court repeatedly instructs lower courts\nto interpret statutes consistent with the statutory\ncontext. I would urge that in looking at section 1415,\nyou take a look at -- at -- there are now eight\nsections of the statute that reinforce this guarantee.\nIt is hard to imagine a statutory guarantee more\ndeeply embedded in an act than the guarantee of a free\nand appropriate public education than is embedded in\nthe IDEA. Permitting parents to recover their expert\ncosts --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- if the\nparents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it's\nnot going to be free. I mean, the -- the statute gives\nthem --\nMR. VLADECK: But -- but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a right to oppose the\nschool board's choice, and if what you say about making\nit easier on parents of limited resources, they're told\nit's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get\nyour fees.\nMR. VLADECK: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthey lose only when the school board is providing, in\nfact, an education that is appropriate. But where the\nparent prevails because the school board was not\nproviding a free and appropriate education, the act's\nguarantee would be seriously eroded unless parents can\nrecover the costs of their expert -- of their experts.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kuntz, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KUNTZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\nShifting the costs to the school district of\nexperts' fees will also shift scarce public resources\naway from the point where it's most effective, at the\nstage when the parent meets with the IEP team to\nresolve the differences.\nWhen Congress has revisited this statute, as\nit has since 1986, time and time and again, it's --\nit's spoken to the -- to the goal of reducing\nlitigation and -- and reducing the costs associated\nwith litigation. If -- if as the Respondents claim,\nit's central to the fulfillment of this statute that --\nthat Congress be seen to have shifted the costs of\nthese so-called experts to the -- to the school\ndistrict when -- when they prevail, I -- I call to the\nCourt's attention that the reality is that the school\ndistrict has no staff of experts as Respondents\nintimate. It has no staff of consultants.\nWhat it has are the people who actually\nprovide the services to the child, and when they come\nto testify at the hearing, typically they're -- they're\nscared or nervous because it's the first time that\nthey've been at such a hearing. They're not\nprofessional experts. They're not testimonial experts.\nThose are the kinds of experts that the Respondents\nare talking about and asking this Court to see in the\nstatute.\nOne needs to ask the question if Congress\nreally intended expert fees to be a part of this\nstatute, what stayed Congress' hand from writing those\nwords into the statute? It's very clear that Congress\nknew how to do that when it became appropriate, in its\njudgment, for it to do that. To sort of see it here\nlurking in the shadows in -- in sort of the backwaters\nof -- of the act and to intimate from there that the\nplain language of the statute has meaning that needs to\nbe expanded and enlightened by the congressional report\ndoesn't make a lot of -- of sense. If -- if it's that\nimportant, it should have been there. The -- its\nabsence is very, very telling. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't the school boards\nhave some consultants and experts in this area other\nthan the teachers?\nMR. KUNTZ: Typically they do not, Your\nHonor. The typical IEP team meeting has the school\npsychologist perhaps, has the -- the teachers of the --\nof the child. Those -- some of those are required\nmembers. It has the parent of a handicapped child. It\nmight have the -- the service providers like the speech\npathologist. And when -- when it comes to a trial,\ncomes to a due process hearing, those are the folks who\ncome and testify as to what they know about the child,\nthe test results they have. There are no typical\nconsultants or testimonial experts that appear for the\nschool district.\nSo the -- the central part of this statute,\nits -- its revolution, where it brings parents of\nchildren who are disabled into contact with the -- with\nthe school, has had a wonderful effect in fulfilling\nthe promise of this statute. Energizing the litigation\naspect of this by transferring those costs to the\nschool district will -- will take away and will detract\nfrom the -- the true meaning of the statute, which was\nto build a partnership between the parents and the\nschool district, not to let it dribble off into\nlitigation.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kuntz.\n"
