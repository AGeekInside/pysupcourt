        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning -- this morning in Case\n10-779, William Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont, v.\nIMS Health Incorporated.\nMs. Asay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ASAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder State and Federal law, doctors write\nprescriptions for their patients to allow them access to\ndrugs that the government deems too dangerous for\nunrestricted sale. Vermont's law allow doctors to\ndecide whether this information that they're compelled\nto provide to pharmacies may be used in marketing that\nis directed at them.\nDrug companies would certainly like to have\nthis information for marketing, but they have no First\nAmendment right to demand it, just as they have no right\nto demand access to the doctor's tax returns, his\npatient files, or to their competitors' business\nrecords.\nVermont's law does not regulate the content\nof the marketing pitches and the advertising that drug\ncompanies provide about their products or their\ncompetitors' products. It regulates access to this\ninformation that's created in a highly regulated regime\nof prescription drugs and in the context of the\ndoctor-patient relationship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The purpose -- the\npurpose is to prevent sales representatives from\ncontacting particular physicians, right?\nMS. ASAY: I disagree, Your Honor. The\npurpose of the statute is to let doctors decide whether\nsales representatives will have access to this inside\ninformation about what they have been prescribing to\ntheir patients. And what -- what the record shows is\nthat what drug companies do is track and monitor doctors\nvery closely to watch when they switch drugs, to watch\nthe trends by which they -- doctors prescribe, by\ngender, by age. And all that information is used to\ntarget and to direct the marketing projects -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they could use it for\nother purposes, right?\nMS. ASAY: The pharmaceutical manufacturers?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. ASAY: Under this statute they may use\nit for some limited purposes for clinical trials.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what the Chief Justice\nsuggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them\nfrom using it in order to market their drugs?\nMS. ASAY: The purpose is to allow doctors\nto decide whether the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMS. ASAY: -- the information should be\navailable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right, but\nthat -- that is an impediment to their using it for the\nmarketing of drugs. You're -- you're placing that\nimpediment on it. Isn't that the obvious purpose of it?\nI mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but\nlet's not quibble over what the purpose is.\nMS. ASAY: As with any information that\nthe -- that might inform a marketing campaign, not\nhaving the information may be -- make their marketing\nless effective or make it different.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the purpose. That's\nthe purpose of it, to prevent them from using this\ninformation to market their drugs.\nMS. ASAY: Again, Your Honor, the purpose is\nto allow doctors to make the decision, and doctors may\nwant to allow its use or not allow its use. But the\nlaw -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's only for that use\nthat you interpose the requirement that the doctor\nconsent. For all other uses you don't require the\ndoctor's consent, right?\nMS. ASAY: The only -- the consent\nrequirement in this statute goes to the use for\nmarketing and also to the sale by the pharmacy, and that\nsale may be for other purposes as well, so there -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Asay, are any of the\nother purposes, like for insurance purposes, cases where\nthe pharmacist is paid for giving out the prescriber\ninformation? Here what they call data miners are paying\nthe pharmacists to get this information. In the case of\nother, others who have access, do any of them also pay\nthe pharmacists?\nMS. ASAY: Your Honor, there's two sort of\nanswers to that. The first is that, with respect to\npharmacies, the record shows here that the only place\nthat the pharmacies disseminate their information is to\nthe data vendors, and that is a commercial sale, and it\nis primarily intended for the marketing purpose.\nInsurers do have information about doctors' prescribing\npractices and patient information. They have that\ninternally from their own claims and their relationships\nwith doctors and patients. So insurers are not -- do\nnot need to buy the data from pharmacies. They have it\nwithout purchasing it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the data is not\nprivate in the sense that the physician who prescribes\nknows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and\nhow much he prescribes and how often, because there are\na lot of people who do know that, right?\nMS. ASAY: That's correct, Your Honor, there\nare people who know what the doctor prescribes and what\nthe patient has received.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the only thing it\nassures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is\nthat he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the\nbasis of their knowledge of information which other\npeople have, approach him in order to market their\ndrugs? That's basically all it assures the prescribing\nphysician, right?\nMS. ASAY: It assures the prescribing\nphysician that his information about prescribing\npractices will not be used for marketing without his\nconsent. It's like the difference -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, and he could achieve\nthe same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to\ntalk to the marketer. When the marketer says, you know,\nI want to talk to you about a new drug, he says: I\ndon't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.\nMS. ASAY: He could not achieve the same\nresult, Your Honor. What the record shows is that\ndoctors are particularly concerned about having access\nto the best information and the most complete\ninformation to make decisions for their patients. And\nthis data, as was discussed by Dr. Granday below, by\nKesselheim, by Mr. Erhari, the former sales\nrepresentative -- they all discussed how the data ends\nup being used to filter the information that doctors\nreceive. So they receive less -\nJUSTICE ALITO: One of the Respondents\nargues that the statute would permit, does permit, the\nuse of this information for what they call a counter\ndetailing effort. Is that correct?\nMS. ASAY: It is not correct, Your Honor, to\nthe extent that Respondents have suggested that\nVermont's academic detailing program, which is called\nthe evidence-based education program, uses this data.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That wasn't really my\nquestion. My question was does the statute permit it.\nIf Vermont wanted to do that, the University of Vermont\nor some other entity wanted to do that, would the\nstatute permit it?\nMS. ASAY: Well, the statute would not\npermit the sale for that purpose, which is a separate\nprovision of the statute, because academic detailing is\nnot an exemption. They would also -- and then the\nquestion of whether the information would be available\nwould default back to the pharmacy board rules, which\nagain -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could that data be sold to\na university for research purposes? The university\nsays: We really want this information to do some\nresearch. Could the data be sold to the university for\nthat purpose?\nMS. ASAY: Yes, Your Honor, the statute does\npermit it to be sold for health care research -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the researcher then\nhave a profile, a data bank, that is very helpful to the\ngeneral public, and sell that to the general public, to\nthe newspapers and so forth?\nMS. ASAY: We do not believe so, Your Honor,\nbecause of the background regulations that govern this\ninformation, including Pharmacy Board Rule 20, which we\ncited at page 4 of our brief, which also places\nrestrictions on disclosure of patient and practitioner\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. It's sold to the\nresearcher. The researcher then comes up with a design\nor database that is very fascinating for a number of\nreasons. Can that researcher sell it to the New England\nJournal of Medicine?\nMS. ASAY: I'm not sure if I understand\nwhether the question is about the data itself or results\ndrawn from the data. But to the extent that the statute\nallows the sale of the data for research, the\nrestriction on the other uses would accompany the sale,\nand -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you clarify -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I still am not - I still\nam not sure. In my hypothetical, what would happen?\nMS. ASAY: When the -- if the pharmacy sold\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The pharmacy sells to the\nresearcher.\nMS. ASAY: Right. If that happened -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The researcher is at the\nuniversity. The researcher has a data bank or has some\nresults that are very fascinating. The researcher then\nwants to sell that to the New England Journal of\nMedicine. What result under the statute?\nMS. ASAY: The statute would have required\nthe pharmacy to prevent the further dissemination of the\ndata except for health care research.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You answered my question\nearlier that they don't sell it to anyone else. That's\nwhy I was trying to clarify your answer to Justice\nKennedy, because you told me the only sale -- the\npharmacists, they sell this to the data miners, they do\nnot sell it to the other people. But now you're\nanswering Justice Kennedy's question, yes, they sell it\nto universities.\nMS. ASAY: I apologize, Your Honor, if I was\nnot clear. As a factual matter, we know absolutely that\nthe pharmacies do not sell it to researchers. I had\nunderstood this to be a hypothetical, if they did. But\nas a factual matter, they do not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does it increase the\nprescribing physician's right of privacy that the data\nabout his prescribing can only be given away but can't\nbe sold? Does that make him feel happier about his\nprivacy?\nMS. ASAY: What it allows the doctor to do\nis to avoid an intrusive and invasive marketing\npractice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He can do that by saying:\nI don't want to talk to you.\nMS. ASAY: The doctor cannot -- can shut off\nany communication and any information from the\npharmaceutical companies by slamming the door on the\ndetailers, but that's not necessarily in the interest of\ndoctors or patients. And what this -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but then\njust don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their\nprivacy. Now you're arguing a totally different\npurpose: It makes it easier for the physician to cut\noff approaches by drug companies that want to sell\ndrugs. If that's the purpose of this statute, it's\nquite different from protecting his privacy. His\nprivacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but\nyou can give it away.\nMS. ASAY: Your Honor, I think the\nlegislature here was using privacy to refer to the\nautonomy interest that everyone has to some degree in\ncontrolling the flow or the use of information about\nthem. This Court recognized in the Reporters Committee\ncase in the FOIA context that there was a privacy\ninterest in the aggregation of information on an FBI rap\nsheet.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that -\nassuming there's some form of privacy that relates to\nnot being harassed because there's certainly legislative\nrecord of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to\nfeeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a\nless restrictive method, why does this have to be an\nopt-in rather than an opt-out? Because isn't an opt-out\nI call up and say I, don't want you to have this\ninformation? So isn't an opt-out less restrictive?\nMS. ASAY: An opt-out would not protect the\nprivacy interests as much because it would assume that\ndoctors want to consent. I would like to say that here\nthe statute is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but, given the\nrestrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing?\nMeaning you don't really intend to tell us that the\nState couldn't and wouldn't -- just like we got all of\nthat advertising relating to the opt-out on telephone\nsolicitations, virtually every American knew they could\ndo it if they chose. Maybe some didn't, but a vast\nmajority did. You can't really say Vermont's incapable\nof telling doctors in a mailing or in some public\nprofessional magazine, if you want to opt out, here's\nthe number?\nMS. ASAY: Well, in fact, Your Honor, that's\nexactly what the State does. Every time that the\ndoctors relicense, which is every 2 years, they get a\nform and they can make a decision one way or the other\non the form that they receive. So it's perfectly\ntailored to allow the doctors to decide and to not\nrestrict any marketing between a willing listener and a\nwilling speaker.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another -\nthere's another purpose that I would like you to comment\non, and that is the, the State is interested in\npromoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly\nto reduce the sale of brand name drugs. And if that's\nthe purpose, why doesn't that run up against what this\nCourt has said that you can't, you can't lower the\ndecibel level of one speaker so that another speaker, in\nthis case the generics, can be heard better?\nMS. ASAY: The State does have an interest\nin reducing health care costs here. What's important\nabout this statute is the mechanism by which it allows\ndoctors to decide what information and what kind of\nmarketing they want, and it's different because what\nit's about is access to information in this highly\nregulated area. It's the difference between a doctor\nwho prescribes a nonprescription drug and a patient who\ncan take that information, walk into the pharmacy with a\n$20 bill and leave with their medication, and no one has\nlearned anything about what the doctor prescribed for\nthe patient, about the patient's concerns, or the\ndoctor's concerns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to lower -\nyou want to lower your health care costs, not by direct\nregulation, but by restricting the flow of information\nto the doctors, by, to use a pejorative word, but by\ncensoring what they can hear to make sure they don't\nhave full information, so they will do what you want\nthem to do when it comes to prescribing drugs, because\nyou can't take, I gather, direct action and tell them,\nyou must prescribe generics, right?\nMS. ASAY: I disagree, Your Honor, for -\nfor two reasons. The statute does not limit any of the\ninformation that doctors receive. So the State has not\nin any way intervened in the information that the\npharmaceutical manufacturers can provide to the doctors.\nThey are free -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're restricting\ntheir -- you're -- you're making it far more burdensome\nfor the manufacturers to reach their intended audience,\nright? It's as if I want -- there's a demonstration in\ntown, all right? They need a permit to hold the\ndemonstration. They get the permit. I want to hold a\ncounter-demonstration, and you're saying it doesn't make\nany difference whether I know where their demonstration\nis going to be or not?\nMS. ASAY: I disagree, Your Honor. The -\nthe ability of drug companies to locate the doctors that\nare interested in their products is -- is not something\nthat calls for this data. It's very -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think maybe you're\nbeing -- you were the one that made the argument that\nthe State has an interest in reducing health care costs.\nI assume that is by selling generics. And the Chief\nJustice asked you a question: In effect, aren't you\ndoing this by regulating speech? And you say no, you\ndisagree. I don't understand that answer that you gave\nto the Chief Justice.\nMS. ASAY: It's not a restriction on speech\nbecause it's a restriction only on the access to the\ninformation that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would\nlike to use to inform their advertising, and it's only\nin play if the doctors have objected to the use.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The information necessary\nfor effective speech is what you're saying, right?\nMS. ASAY: Your Honor, it's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It only restricts the\ninformation necessary for really effective speech?\nMS. ASAY: No, I disagree. For\npharmaceutical manufacturers to approach -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're looking for it\nbecause it -- it identifies those doctors that they\nwould like to approach with their information which may\nsay, you know, our product is much better than the\ngeneric; our quality control is -- you know, whatever.\nThere are arguments on both sides of those things. And\nyou are making it more difficult for them to speak by\nrestricting access to information that would enable\ntheir speech to be most effective.\nMS. ASAY: And -- their speech would be more\neffective if they had access to patient information, if\nthey had access to their competitors' trade secrets.\nThere's certainly other information available that they\nwould like to use in marketing, but is not available to\nthem by law, and it -- it's our position that in the\nsame way they do not have a right to demand access to\ninformation about the doctor's prescribing practices\nwithout his consent.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we'll -- we'll\ngive you -- we seem to have questions. We'll give you\nadditional time for rebuttal, so you don't -- don't\nworry that we're cutting into that.\nBut you're making a judgment about how\ntheir -- whether or not their speech will be as\neffective or not. Don't you think they're the ones who\nare entitled to make that judgment? It doesn't mean\nthat you're right or wrong. It just means that we would\nnot rely on your determination that it is -- their\nspeech is just as effective. They're the ones doing the\nspeaking and they think it's not.\nMS. ASAY: Again, Your Honor, I don't think\nwe disagree that the -- the pharmaceutical manufacturers\nconsider this information useful and helpful in\ntargeting their marketing campaigns. The issue in this\ncase is whether their right trumps the right of the\ndoctor.\nAnd if you go back to -- to the source of\nthis information, to the underlying transaction, the\ndoctor prescribing the drug for a patient and the\npharmacy dispensing it, the doctor and the pharmacy have\nthe same stake in that transaction. And until this\npoint the pharmacy has had complete control over whether\nthe information gets sold into this commercial stream\nfor marketing use. And all the statute does is put the\ndoctor on the same -- in the same place as the pharmacy\nin terms of deciding what further use can be made of the\ninformation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question?\nDo you agree with the Solicitor General's interpretation\nof the statute?\nMS. ASAY: Yes, we do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did you make that argument\nbelow? Is that a change in your position?\nMS. ASAY: It is not a change in our\nposition. It is not an issue that was pressed below,\nbecause of the facts on the ground. There is only one\ntransaction here. There's a sale from the pharmacies to\nthe data vendors for these commercial purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't this\ninconsistent with what you told the court of appeals?\nMS. ASAY: In our court of appeals brief,\nfor example, at page 29 to 30, we describe that sentence\nof the statute as restricting both the sale of the\ninformation and the use for marketing. And on page -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you're\nrepresenting to us that you told the court of appeals\nthe statute should be interpreted as the SG is\ninterpreting it here; that's your representation?\nMS. ASAY: It is my representation that -\nthat we did not say anything contrary to that, Your\nHonor; and that it really was not pressed below. So I\nwould not say that we, in our briefs below, fully laid\nout the position as the SG has, but we did not disagree\nwith it, either.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's an important\nposition. If you -- if that indeed was the meaning of\nthe statute, you should have told the court of appeals,\ndon't you think? Is it enough to say we didn't say no?\nYou should have said yes. You should have said this is\nwhat it means.\nMS. ASAY: And again, Your Honor, if I could\npoint also to pages 47 to 48 of our -- of our Second\nCircuit brief, we did frame the issue as whether there\nwas a right to buy and sell prescription records. The\nissue has always been in the case. But again the facts\non the ground, there has only been this one transaction,\nand that -- that really was what we were litigating\nabout.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the court of appeals\non page 22a of the petition, summarizing what it\nunderstood you to be arguing, says: \"The statute only\nimposes restrictions on the sale or use of such data for\nmarketing or promoting a prescription drug.\" That was\nan inaccurate characterization of your -- the Second\nCircuit did not understand your argument?\nMS. ASAY: Again, Your Honor, I -- I don't\nthink that the argument was really framed clearly below.\nBut we did not -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you please -- could\nyou please answer yes or no? If you're changing your\nposition, you're changing your position. It seems to me\nthis is an important point, and if the Second Circuit\nbased its decision on a misunderstanding of Vermont's\ninterpretation of its own statute, I would think you\nwould at least bring that out in the petition for\nrehearing.\nMS. ASAY: I -- I understand, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you did not?\nMS. ASAY: We did not.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And could you explain how\nyou're going to interpret your statute going forward and\napply your statute going forward?\nMS. ASAY: Yes, Your Honor. We interpret\nthe first clause of the statute to be a restriction on\nsale, except for sale for the exemptions that are set\nforth in the statute. And the other provisions of the\nstatute: The second provision is a restriction on the\nuse for marketing; and the third provision is a\nrestriction that would apply to pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers who have obtained the data for permissible\npurposes and -- and need to abide by the continuing\nrestriction on the use. And the consent provision would\napply to each of those parts of the statute.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll afford you 5\nminutes for rebuttal.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Vermont statute protects important\ninterests that the Vermont legislature could recognize\nin physician autonomy and control over information that\nconcerns them. When a patient brings a prescription to\na pharmacy, after that point the patient information is\nprotected under HIPAA and under State law. That leaves\ntwo primary actors in that transaction -- the physician\nand the pharmacy. Both are professionals, both are\nsubject to regulation under a comprehensive, closed\nsystem for the distribution of drugs.\nPrior to the time this statute was enacted,\nthe pharmacy had complete control over the disposition\nof that information. What this statute does is put the\nphysician, the prescriber, on an equal footing with\nrespect to the pharmacy -- with the pharmacy, with\nrespect to the use of the information about that\nprescriber, but only with respect to the use of the\ninformation in marketing to that prescriber. It is a\nnarrowly drawn statute that enables the physician, not\nthe State, enables the physician to determine whether\nthe information that he was required to furnish in\nconnection with the prescribing of a drug will be used\nin the marketing of products to that -- to that\nphysician.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he's required to\nprovide it, but he would be required to provide it quite\napart from the government regulation, right? I mean,\nthe pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription\nout to.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's because it's a\nprescription drug. Federal and State law require a\nprescription for a prescription drug. But if this was\nnot a prescription drug, a person can go into a drug\nstore and purchase a nonprescription drug just like any\nother item in a drug store, not have to furnish the\nname, not have to furnish any of this information. So\nthe information is furnished because of the requirement\nof a prescription which is of long standing.\nSo this statute is really of a piece with a\n-- with a number of other types of regulations to\nprotect -- protect privacy, for example, the Driver's\nPrivacy Protection Act, where a person is required to\nfurnish certain information in order to get a driver's\nlicense. That statute prohibits the commercial\nexploitation of that information.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't protect his\nprivacy. I mean, the -- his name and -- and the extent\nof his prescriptions can be given away for a lot of\nuses. It doesn't protect his privacy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It protect -- it enables\nhim to protect himself against drug companies that want\nto talk to him.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that's -- the term\n\"privacy\" is used to embrace that sort of autonomy and\ncontrol over information. That's -- that's the way in\nwhich we're -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right, so long as I\nknow that's what you're talking about. When you say\n\"privacy,\" you don't mean the prescriber's concern that\npeople will know that he prescribed certain drugs. He\ndoesn't care about that, right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, he certainly does -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is not protected by\nthis law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: He -- he certainly -- he\ncertainly does care about that. And the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not protected by this\nlaw.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there are other -\nthere are other principles that protect it. The -\nthe -- the State's pharmacy regulations require\npharmacies to maintain the confidentiality -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about what this\nlaw protects. It does not protect his privacy in that\nsense. It protects his privacy in the sense that it\nenables him to avoid having to say go away when a\nsalesman for the -- for the -- for the drug company\ncomes, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, well -- it -- it -- it's\na lesser version of that, a less restrictive version of\nthat, because it doesn't put either the pharmaceutical\ncompany or the physician in the position of an\nall-or-nothing situation.\nWhat -- what the law allows is the physician\nto -- to say, you can -- you can come visit me, but I\ndon't want you to use this information that has\notherwise been kept confidential under pharmacy rules to\nmarket to me. That enables the physician to choose to\nhave what the physician may choose -- may see as a more\nobjective presentation. It puts -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it doesn't even\nprotect his privacy in the sense that it enables him not\nto have to say go away. It doesn't even protect that.\nThey -- he -- he will still have to say that -\nMR. KNEEDLER: If he -- if he doesn't -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if the drug company\napproaches him without having this information.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- if he doesn't want to\ntalk to the -- to the detailer at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But what this allows for -\nphysicians see value to this, but what this allows for\nis for the physician to say: I don't want my\ninformation to be used by this drug company in a way -\nsort of inside information about my overall prescribing\npractices. I would -- I would prefer to have a\npresentation made to me without the information about\nme, but information about the drugs that might be -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about the doctor who\ndidn't want the information distributed to anybody,\nacademic researchers, anybody? Does the law give\nthat -- give the doctor that option?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it does not, but\nthat's -- that's common in -- in -- in confidentiality\nstatutes. For example, HIPAA, which protects the\npersonal information of -- of persons in the health care\nsystem, that information can be used and frankly would\nhave to be used, for example, for paying insurance\nclaims. The insurer needs to know what prescriptions or\nwhat other medical services might have been provided.\nThe same thing with respect to insurers\ncontrolling their costs, because there are formularies\nand preferred drug lists. And so, people in that\nposition necessarily have to be able to use prescriber\ninformation in order to find out whether -- whether\nsomething was suitably prescribed under the preferred\ndrug list. So, it -- it's -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought our\nprecedents made -- indicated that it's problematic for\nthe State to make a determination about what uses\ninformation can be -- to what uses information can be\nput, particularly when it's an interested party as it is\nhere.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, what the statute does\nis allow the physician -- or the prescriber to make that\nchoice. It's information about the prescriber that the\nprescriber was required to furnish in connection with\nissuing a prescription.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you told\nme that -- I thought you told me that this doesn't\nprotect physician privacy to the extent of saying this\ninformation can't be used for academic purposes even if\nyou, the physician, don't want it to be used for those\npurposes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and -- and -- and\nagain, that -- that's true in a variety of -- of -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the physician\ndoesn't get to decide for what uses the information -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not -- not -- not altogether,\nbut that doesn't mean that there is no confidentiality\ninterest or no autonomy or control interest, because a\nphysician practicing medicine knows that his patient's\ninsurer is going to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the statute\n-- I'm sorry. What if the statute said this information\ncan be used for any number of purposes, except not for\nanybody who is going to criticize the State of Vermont?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that would not be -- that\nwould not be permissible. It would not be germane to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This information -\nthis information cannot be used for any purposes -- can\nbe used for any purposes except a purpose that will make\nthings more expensive for the State of Vermont?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I mean, that's -\nthat's a very broad goal. I mean, here -- here what the\nState has done is -- is put the control in the\nphysician, who is a critical player in the -- in the\ndelivery system. So it's narrowly tailored to the\nphysician's use of the information about him in -- in\nconnection with how -- how he will be approached.\nIt's also important to recognize that this\nis very different from the general advertising cases\nthis Court has had under the commercial speech doctrine.\nThis is not public advertising. This I think falls into\nthe camp of Dun and Bradstreet, where you have a -- a\ntargeted limited business audience, a -- a -- really\none-on-one. It's not -- it's not radio or television\nadvertising. It's one-on-one advertising in which the\npublic interest is -- is much more limited, and it's\none-on-one with respect to the very person whose\ninformation was first furnished by the physician to the\npharmacy, so -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the\npharmaceutical company deems this to be the most\nefficient. What you're saying is that the State can\nprohibit the most efficient sort of speech, whereas if\nit just had general dissemination which didn't serve any\nparticular purpose, that would be all right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but if it becomes -\nbecomes focused and important and effective, then the\nState can prohibit it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's allowing the other\nperson to that representation visit to decide whether\ninformation about him, not other information; about him\n-- will be used in that situation. It's very much like\na don't -- a \"do not call\" statute or a \"do not mail\"\nstatute, in which people have the right to say: Do not\ncontact me for commercial information, except this one\nis more limited. This one says -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you say -\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- do not use information\nabout me to contact me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say I don't\nlike to be bothered by people knocking on my door by\nsaying, sign this petition. Can I -- to protect my\nprivacy interests, can I prevent that as a general\nmatter?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but you could post a sign\nsaying \"no solicitations,\" and I think under this\nCourt's cases that -- that sort of protection -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can the State enact a law\nthat, say, petition signers cannot approach somebody\nunless he has given his prior consent?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but I think the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But I think the State\ncould -- could enact a law that said if someone posts a\nsign saying do not -- do not approach me, do not knock\non my door for this purpose -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doctors can do that if they\ndon't want to talk to the -\nMR. KNEEDLER: If they don't want to talk at\nall. But this -- but this -- this is -- this is\naddressed to a more limited problem and therefore is\nmore narrowly tailored, which is that it -- what -\nwhat -- what the pharmaceutical company can't do without\nthe physician's consent is to -- is to use information\nthat was gathered about that very individual to approach\nhim.\nIt puts -- it puts the physician on an equal\nfooting with the pharmacy at the -- at the beginning of\nthe -- of the stream of commerce, it puts the physician\non -- on an equal footing with the pharmacy or the\npharmaceutical company at the other end by saying: I'm\ngoing to keep that information about me to myself if\nyou'll -- if you are approaching me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, in most of\nour commercial speech cases there has been a commodity.\nHere it's a record maintained by the pharmacist. We\nthink of a pharmacist as selling the brand name or\ngeneric name, but whose list is this? Whose record is\nit? Is it the pharmacist's record the way goods, stock\nin trade, would be?\nMR. KNEEDLER: May I answer -- answer the\nquestion?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is -- it is in the\npossession of the pharmacy. But what the State has done\nis to legitimately recognize that the physician has a\nstake in some of the information on that list, and in\nthat respect the list is a -- is a commodity. The State\nis regulating its commodity aspect, not its\ncommunicative or expressive aspect, in -- in this\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court, good morning:\nYou will want to have available you to the\nred brief of IMS Health, Incorporated, which in its\nappendix reproduces the statutes and findings. And the\nreason we have to look at the statutes and findings in\nthis argument is because the case can't be decided as a\nmatter of absolutes.\nWe know that statutes like HIPAA do protect\nprivate information in third parties' hands and they are\nconstitutional. On the other hand, we also know that a\ngovernmental restriction on the use of information could\nbe used to distort the marketplace of ideas. So the\ncase is going to have to be decided somewhere in the\nmiddle. And in order to do that, we're going to have to\nfigure out where in the middle Vermont ended up.\nNow, in doing that I want to clarify I think\nthree things in the questioning of the first half hour.\nThey are about what the practice are -- practices are at\nissue here; what this statute does, actually what's the\nrule; and why is it that Vermont did it.\nSo as to Justice Ginsburg's question, are\nthere other sales, the State gave you the correct answer\nthat the pharmacy companies don't sell to researchers,\nbut that's somewhat misleading. They sell to us, and we\nsell to the researchers, we sell to the government, the\nintermediaries like IMS Health. That's because we're\nthe aggregator. So it is not correct to say that the\nonly sale is for pharmaceutical marketing.\nSecond, on the important question of what\nthis statute -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I asked whether there are\nsales to any other entities.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, and I said the State\ngave you the accurate answer. But the implication of\nthe answer I think was not quite correct, because there\nare sales for purposes other than for marketing.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But if this was a general\nsale provision, then that would include those sales that\nyou're talking about?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It would not, because the\npoint would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a\nminute, because all the exemptions -- right? So\nthere's -- there's a debate that Justice Alito focused\non about what does the statute mean, and I do want to\nturn to that in a second.\nBut to jump ahead to your question, Justice\nKagan, assume that it's a general sale prohibition.\nThen there are all the exemptions and the exemptions\ntake all of these other uses out from the sale\nprohibition: for academic research, to go to the\ngovernment, and for clinical trials, for health care\nresearch. Those are all exempted from the general sale\nprohibition.\nSo let's do turn, if you don't mind, to what\nit is the statute actually does. It is an important\npoint. First, I am going to come to our brief, but I\njust want to read something. For your later reference\nI'm going to have been reading from page 42 of PhRMA's\nbrief, and this is what -- what the State told the\nSecond Circuit, quote: \"Data vendors may continue to\nacquire, edit, and sell this information to whomever\nthey choose so long as that person does not use the\ninformation for detailing.\"\nIn turn, the Second Circuit -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What was your page again?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry. That's going to be\nfrom the PhRMA brief, the other red brief at page 42, at\nthe top of the page.\nSo, to whomever they choose, so long as that\nperson does not use the information for detailing. The\nSecond Circuit said: Okay, you're the State; here's how\nwe understand the statute. The statute only imposed -\nquoting again, this is from 22A, it's the language that\nJustice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes\n\"restrictions on the sale or use of such data for\nmarketing or promoting a prescription drug.\" So that's\nwhat they understood the statute to do.\nNow, then the question becomes why did they\ndo it? This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really\nhard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge\nwhat the point is here. And the State tries to deny\nthat the purpose here is to limit the information\ngetting into the hands of the doctor. We don't have to\nrely on the State's lawyers. The State legislature was\nvery helpful here.\nSo if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief\nnow, page 1a, okay. Right at the top, the State says\ntheir goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom\nof it -- containing health care costs.\nThen in finding number 2 they explain why\nthey did it: \"There is a strong link between\npharmaceutical marketing activities, health care\nspending and the health of Vermonters.\"\nThen finding number 3: \"The goals of\nmarketing programs are often in conflict with the goals\nof the State.\"\nAnd my favorite, obviously, is number 4:\n\"The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State\ndetermined, was operating in conflict with the goals of\nthe State.\" They didn't like the marketplace of ideas.\nNow, it is true, we acknowledge, that\nanother thing the State wanted to do was to give the\ndoctors some more control. It's in -- it's in -- there\nis an opt-out option.\nBut can I just take you to how the State\nexplained what it was doing? That's just going to be on\npage 7. Now, the State's lawyer and the Solicitor\nGeneral have explained to you that they believe that\ndoctors were concerned only with marketing and only with\nmarketing to them. That's not true. Finding 29. We\nhave to go all the way to number 29 to get to this goal\nof the State: \"Health care professionals in Vermont\" -\nI'm on page 7: \"Health care professionals in Vermont\nwho write prescriptions for their patients have a\nreasonable expectation that the information in that\nprescription, including their own identity and that of\nthe patient, will not be used for purposes other than\nthe filling and processing of the payment for that\nprescription.\"\nIt's not just about pharmaceutical\nmarketing. The doctors say -- we all love this; there's\nstuff about us in our daily lives that we wish was\nentirely private. The doctors here said: Hey, it would\nbe great for us if this information, we had complete\ncontrol over it. Doctors also would love if medical\nmalpractice judgments weren't broadly known. There are\nall kinds of government records they would prefer not to\nbe out into the public sphere.\nBut then we ask ourselves, all right -- and\nthat's why I asked you to have this brief available -\nwhat did the State do? Did the State in fact enact a\ngeneral privacy provision? Is it like HIPAA or instead\nis all that the State did here target the use for\nmarketing, while it allows the use of the same data for\nthe opposite message by insurers and also by the\ngovernment?\nSo here's the statute. It appears on page 9\nof the appendix. I want to start with subsection A\nbecause the State helpfully reiterates its goals here.\nThe second half of this paragraph: \"The State sought to\nensure costs are contained in the private health care\nsector, as well as for State purchasers of prescription\ndrugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and\nensuring prescribers received unbiased information.\"\nThat's what they're trying to do. They're trying to\nsay: We would like the drug companies to have a harder\ntime finding the doctors while the insurance companies\nand the State have an easy time finding the doctors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there is another\ninterest here besides the State's concern about health\ncare costs, and that is the physician's privacy\ninterests.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can sell this\ninformation to whomever you want, right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could sell to it\na journalist who wants to expose physicians in a\nparticular area who prescribe a lot of a particular\nmedication.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the public can\ndiscern well, this is the guy who is treating these\npeople; we don't like these people, so we're going to\nPickett outside his clinic.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, nothing\nprevents you from doing that, right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, don't you\nthink that's protecting physicians' privacy, to prevent\nthat from happening?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, I apologize. We're\nallowed to do it before and after the statute, is my\npoint. Remember, what the statute does is -- and this\nwas the debate that Justice Alito tried to point us to\nabout what the statute actually does and the Second\nCircuit, what it understood the statute to mean. And I\nshould also say the cert petition didn't say that there\nwas a problem with that.\nVermont picked out one thing. It said:\nLook, when drug companies can find the doctors easily,\nthey can persuade the doctors to use more expensive\ndrugs. We pay a lot for drugs. We would prefer that\nnot happen, so we're going to make it harder. And the\nState will have its counter-detailing program, it will\nhave its drug utilization review program, and insurers\nwill advocate for less expensive drugs. All the other\nuses are still permitted.\nIf Vermont were serious about protecting the\ndoctors' privacy, as opposed to kind of a, a right of\npublicity, a control over information about them, it\nwouldn't have all these exemptions; it would have a\nprovision that says this is private information.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose -\nsuppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year\nstudy of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides\n-- finds the following. They say: We have found that\nwhen drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that\nthe doctor find out what's curable, what the drug does,\nhow much it costs; and by the way, all those things\napply no matter who the doctor is. Who the doctor is,\nis irrelevant. And therefore marketing that focuses\nupon who the doctor is and what his previous practices\nwere is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore\nwe find that it is a false and deceptive practice under\nsection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the\nfollowing prior practices of the doctor in selling him\nnew drugs, because it's irrelevant and because it's\nfalse and because it's harmful. And they enact that as\na -- as a rule of the Federal Trade Commission.\nDoes the Constitution of the United States\nforbid them, having made those findings in detail, from\ncontrolling advertising to prevent what they have\ndetermined is a false and misleading practice?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do know -- I don't know,\nbut I do know the First Amendment applies to the rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, nobody says it doesn't\napply. The question -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: They -- they do. I've got a\ncouple people -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what\nthey're saying for the present purposes. I'm\ninterested, surprisingly enough, in what I'm saying.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So therefore I would like\nto know the answer.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is a highly regulated\nindustry.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the Federal Trade\nCommission's specialists and experts in false and\ndeceptive advertising concludes that this is a false and\ndeceptive practice, are you going to say that the\nConstitution of the United States forbids them from\ndoing that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I am, but I'm also going to\nsay that I don't have to win that argument to win this\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, when you say\nyou are, is there any precedent that says they can't\nregulate false and misleading practice? Of course you\nsee where I'm going.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they can, why can't\nVermont?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. If it's actually\nfalse and misleading. You can't just -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they said it was\nbiased -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and they -- they have\nmade a study of it in the legislature and that's their\nconclusion.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that the\ngovernment can say that because speech is so influential\nit is false and biased. But I will say, Justice Breyer,\nin my defense that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't take \"biased\" to\nmean false. \"Biased\" means one-sided.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's exactly right.\nAnd what we like -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You state the true facts\nonly on one side and not the other.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This case has not been\nargued as a case restricting false advertising, has it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's a case about\nrestricting true advertising.\nJustice Breyer, can I just make one point\nreally quick? And that is, you dissented in Thompson v.\nWestern States and your dissent in that case says these\nare drugs, the compounded drugs that have not been\napproved by the FDA, and I'm very concerned that you're\nevading the FDA regulatory requirements about truthful\nadvertising.\nThese are the opposite drugs. These are the\ndrugs that all the messages that are being conveyed here\nhave been preapproved by the FDA. This is truthful and\naccurate speech, and the State only wants one side of\nthe debate to get out.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where I was going.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I chose an example that's\nbeyond your case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's why it's called a\nhypothetical.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's why I wondered\nhow you would respond to that. So -- I thought that was\none that was going to be obviously constitutional, but\nyou're going to stop me there. So -- so what I want to\nsay -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is how is this\ndifferent?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I suppose I don't know\nthe extent to which this does or does not promote\nunbiased information from going to the doctors, and\nisn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the\nVermont legislature rather than this Court to decide?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. A couple of things\nabout that. First, as I said, these are messages that\nhave been cleared by the experts. The FDA has to review\nall the detailing communications.\nSecond, the doctors do get to say: I don't\nwant you to come visit me. They do that all the time.\nMy dad's a doctor; he doesn't visit with detailers.\nThis is instead a rule about whether you can talk\nabout -- about someone, not talk to someone.\nThe drug companies and the intermediaries\nare talking about drug -- about prescriber practices,\nand you can decide who you want to try and approach.\nThere's nothing alleged to be false or misleading.\nThird, the way the First Amendment works in\nthe marketplace of ideas that so upsets Vermont is that\nboth sides get to tell their story, right? The thing\nthat is supposed to be biased here is that the drug\ncompanies have too much money. That is not a basis for\nrestricting speech.\nThe way it works is if the message is\naccurate, as the FDA has determined it to be, the drug\ncompanies can go make their pitch. Vermont can come\nalong and make the opposite pitch. Terrific. So can\ninsurance companies.\nBut what you can't do is have a rule that\nsays one side is going to have a much harder time\ngetting to their audience.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Goldstein, I -- I\nunderstand your argument and I have a difficulty. Today\nwith the Internet and with computers, there's virtually\nno privacy individuals have. Any transaction you do\ncould be spread across the world instantaneously, and\nfor the longest time catalogs would sell your name and\naddress to other catalogers, and if you bought one\nproduct from one company, you would get a thousand\ncatalogs from 50 million others.\nToday the industry is policing that, in part\nto get the State not to intercede, by giving you an\nopt-out option. And so, if you're a consumer who\ndoesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving\nyou the right to opt out, so they don't sell your\naddress.\nIf there is, as I see, some interest that\nthe State legitimately has in protecting that part of\nthe public who says, I entered into this transaction, I\ndidn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want\nyou to do other things with it, all I did was this\ntransaction, why can't the State say -- there is a\ndifference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out?\nWhy can't the State say, your desire to enter a\ntransaction in which you're doing just that transaction\nand not others is something we can protect?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It can. And let me explain\nwhy it is that that rule -- and let me typify it for\nyou. There is a pending bill in the Congress called the\nMcCain-Kerry Consumer Protection Act and it does what\nyou're talking about. It says we're not just going to\nleave it to the industry; we're going to have a set of\ngovernmental rules.\nLet me distinguish that bill from what goes\non under Act 80. What that says is that if you are a\nconsumer and you engage in a transaction, you have the\nright to opt out of any unauthorized uses, because it's\njust between you and the business, right?\nSo there are three differences between that\nand this. The first is the structure of the statute.\nThat's not what this statute does. This statute says\nevery use of the information is just fine, except this\none, this one that allows one speaker who we don't\nreally like to go out and convey its message.\nThe second difference is the public\nimportance of the speech involved. What that consumer\ninformation would be used for is to make some random\nconsumer pitch to you or about you. This is information\nabout lifesaving medications where the detailer goes in\nand talks about double blind scientific studies that are\nresponsible for the development of drugs that have\ncaused 40 percent of the increase in the lifespan of the\nAmerican public. So there's a tremendous difference in\nthe public importance.\nThe third is the fundamentally different\nnature of the privacy interest. Unlike your consumer\ntransaction over the Internet, this is a doctor. You\ncan call up any doctor's office and find out what their\nprescribing practice is. It's part of their business.\nImagine the following conversation, if you\nwill, and that is, and -- and if you want to look for a\nplace in the common law where this comes from, it would\nbe section 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,\nwhat things are private and what aren't. It asks\nwhether a reasonable person would be outraged.\nIf one doctor were to say to another one,\nyou know what, Dr. Smith told people that three out of\nfour times I prescribe Aciphex for -- as a proton pump\ninhibitor, would anybody be outraged about that? No.\nBut if you knew that the -- the company that you bought\nfrom on the Internet was selling that information or if\nthey were giving away private medical information, you\nwould genuinely be outraged.\nSo, Justice Sotomayor, the reason I started\nthis argument about it has to end up in the middle is we\nknow that statutes like that have to be constitutional.\nAt the same time, we know that the government can use\ncontrols over information to really distort speech. So\nthe question is, what happens in this statute? And this\nstatute has a structure that's not intended to protect\nprivacy. It would look totally different.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read in one of the\nbriefs that pharmacies were not permitting either\npatients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient\ncame in and said I don't want my doctor's information\nsold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I\ndon't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies\nare not respecting those limitations.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't I read this\nstatute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are\ndoing, which is giving people some control outside of\nthe limited transaction that they're engaged in?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. A couple of things.\nRemember, the patients have nothing to do with this.\nThe State doesn't give any control to the patient. That\nwould be true before or after. So we're talking about\nthe doctors.\nI -- I did concede, when I read you finding\n29 at page 7 of the appendix, that this does give a\nlittle bit more control to the doctor. I mean, it just\ndoes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I stop you?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that this statute\ndoesn't give the patient any control. But the patient\nis already taken care of by the Federal law. You can't\n-- I mean, the patient is protected. The question is\nwhether the physician should be as well.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I agree, Justice Ginsburg.\nJustice Sotomayor in her question to me said, why don't\nI read this as giving -- she said that they aren't\ngiving patients options about what happens with this\nprescription information. My only point was this\nstatute doesn't change it.\nYou're quite right that our -- our position\nis no threat to the protection of private health\ninformation, which is reasonably regarded as extremely\nconfidential. So, on the question of whether it give\nsome greater control, it does. But what -- the thing\nyou have to focus on here is the line that it draws in\nwhen it gives greater control is a line that's intended\nto discriminate against a speaker.\nYou have to look, take -- I'll give you an\nexample of this, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network. The\nCity of Cincinnati came to you and said, look, we've\neliminated the commercial news racks, and these people\nwho want to sell their commercial stuff should use\nsomething other than news racks. We're targeting the\nblight that comes from commercial news racks. This\nCourt said: Look, you can't redefine your interests to\nreflect your statute. You can't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could the Federal Power -\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say, we want\nyou to collect certain information about who is using\nwhat natural gas and give it to the fire department?\nIt's for the fire department in case of emergency, and\nwhat we don't want to have happen is it's used to stove\nmanufacturers to sell homeowners gas stoves.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They could do that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's LAPD v. United\nReporting.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine. If they\ncould do that, why can't they do this?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because the key point in\nLAPD v. United Reporting is that it's in the hands of\nthe government. Let me -- the fact -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is\ninformation -- see, this is information that starts off\nbeing collected because the government requires it to be\ncollected. So it's there for that reason. And the\ngovernment says we want you to get this information,\nit's done for this purpose, so, you know, other\npurposes, and we don't want it to be used for commercial\nadvertising purposes. That's what they say they've done\nin this statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's what they say.\nThey're just not right.\nThe -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: This information -- I would\ndirect you to the amicus brief -- you don't have to pull\nit out right now, but for later. The brief of the\nNational Association of Chain Drugstores, if you just\nmake a reference, on pages 10 to 11 collects the history\nof how this information has been gathered. And they\nmake the point that the Court did in the first 30\nminutes, that of course the doctor is going to put his\nname on the prescription. We have to be able to call\nthe doctor and say: I can't read your handwriting.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a statute\nin which the pharmacy cannot give the information or\nsell the information to anybody; it must remain with the\npharmacy.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A copy of the prescription\nmust be given to the State of Vermont. The State of\nVermont then has the same restrictions that this statute\nhas. That would be LAPD.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be LAPD. If\nthe -- it would be almost LAPD.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what -- and I want to\nknow what your answer would be. If LAPD is correct -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what ruling would we\nhave to make in my hypothetical case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. If it's in the hands\nof the -- so let me just make sure I am on the same\npage. I am going to answer your question directly.\nThe pharmacy can't disclose it directly to\nanyone else. The government gets a copy of it. That\ndoes not make it LAPD. If the pharmacy was government\nowned, that would be LAPD. Now, let me answer your\nhypothetical. Right? LAPD, it was an arrest record, it\nwas in the hands only of the State. The Court said:\nLook, this is the State's information. Justice\nGinsburg's concurrence says: It's like a subsidy, the\ndecision whether to give it out or not.\nNow, in your hypothetical, which is it is in\na private hand, but it is banned for any other use -\nthat would be a real privacy statute. I think that it\nwould still be unconstitutional, but it would be much\ncloser.\nThe reason it might be unconstitutional is\ntwofold. First, that the privacy interest in it I think\nis not very significant, because it's how the doctor\nruns his or her business, and second it would still\nallow the discrimination. If you were convinced in your\nhypothetical that what Vermont was trying to do is what\nit said it was doing here in its findings, and that is,\nto make it harder for the drug companies to reach the\naudience and make it easier for the insurance company\nand the government to reach their audience, Greater New\nOrleans Broadcasting, which involves a ban on private\ncasino speech but not tribal and governmental speech,\nsays discriminating against speakers like that is very\ntroubling. So that's I think how your hypothetical -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you're saying I\nthink to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier\nquestion by saying the State cannot constitutionally\nstop the spread of information. So if the State said to\nthe pharmacy, all you can do is fill the prescription,\nthat's what doctors think pharmacies are doing, and\nthat's all you can do, you're saying that's\nunconstitutional?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I am saying that that's\nunconstitutional. I am also saying that the reason is\nvery specific to this kind of information, that is that\nit would allow speaker discrimination, and I am also\nsaying most emphatically that is not this case. That\nwould be a much closer case. It would look much more\nlike a real privacy statute.\nWhat I would take from the hypothetical is\nnot the lesson we should lose -- and you should never\ntake that lesson -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: -- but the -- but instead\nthe lesson that that's what's so different about this\nstatute. This statute, as in all the language quoted\nearlier, says Katie bar the door, do whatever you want\nto do with this stuff, just don't do something we\ndisagree with when it comes to the message.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're really -- you\nare really hinging your argument on the discrimination\naspect -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I am -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that --that drug\ncompanies or detailers are being treated differently\nthan any other user of this information?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is a principal part of\nour argument. I did say before in describing the\nKerry-McCain bill, that there were three things, not\njust the discrimination, but the greater public interest\nof the -- the detailer speech and the lower privacy\ninterest, so I wouldn't throw those out.\nNow can I just preempt an argument that my\nfriend from the Vermont -- State of Vermont is going to\nsay in her rebuttal? And that, is she's going to come\nand say that, look, the insurance companies are actually\npaying for the drugs. All their -- this exception is\nnot one that's about advocacy, and I just want to make\nsure we all know ahead of time because I don't get a\nsurrebuttal, that that's not accurate.\nSo if -- if you still have the IMS brief\nwith you at page 53 this time, so at page 53 the first\nparagraph is about the State's own use of this\ninformation for a variety of purposes. There is -- the\nreply brief for the State introduces a debate about\ntoday whether they are using the NPI data for\ncounter-detailing. There is no dispute that they use it\nfor other State programs, like the drug utilization\nprogram -- that's the quotes in the first paragraph.\nBut the better paragraph is going to be -- it's the\nsecond paragraph, it starts, the State -- \"the statute's\nparallel formulary compliance exemption.\" And this\nparagraph talks about advocacy by the insurance\ncompanies. So it's not just that the drug -- insurance\ncompany says to the doctor, I'll pay for -- $5 for this\ndrug, but the insurance companies take PI data under the\nexemption in the statute, go to doctors and say we\nreally think this cheaper drug would be better. That is\nstraight-out speaker discrimination.\nSo we quote Kolassa: \"Insurance companies\nare using physician-identifiable information to call\nphysicians to try to get them to comply with\nformularies, to try to get them to change their\nprescribing in a way that may or may not be in the\npatient's best interests. In just\" -- this is a further\nquote -- \"In just the last couple of years there has\nbeen an amazing increase in the amount of information\nprovided by payers, insurers that will send scientific\ndocuments to physicians\" -- I've rolled over to page\n53 -- \"will call when physicians are prescribing too\nmuch or too little of a product and provide them with\ninformation.\" It goes on and on -- \"virtually several\ntimes a day.\"\nSo that is the message that I would take\naway from the argument, and that is we are emphatically\nin favor of the constitutionality of HIPAA, of the\nMcCain-Kerry bill, the things that concerned you. You\nhave to decide this case in the middle about what\nVermont actually did, and it was unbelievably candid\nabout what it was trying to do. It said the marketplace\nof ideas doesn't work for us, and so it designed a\nstatute -- and you can decide this case very narrowly on\nthe ground that what Vermont did is it went too far is\nin just saying we're not actually trying to protect\nprivacy; what we're trying to do is give the doctors\ncontrol when it suits our own best interests.\nI do want to preempt one other last\nargument, and that is the suggestion that this isn't\npaternalistic at all. Right? We just let the doctors\ndecide. But the State's goal, what the State is trying\nto do, is paternalistic. The reason the State picked\nthis one exemption, the reason it picked between these\nspeakers, is because it doesn't want this message to get\nto the doctors. And if you can keep -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It used to be true there\nwas something called a regulated industry.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And selling was within\nactivity among many.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there were lots of\nregulations that could be imposed upon selling.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure, right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you saying that all\nthose should be reexamined?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I thankfully am not.\nHere are the -- here are the cases. This was the\nargument that was made and rejected in Virginia Board of\nPharmacy which was about a pharmacy rule. They said\nthat it would be unprofessional. Then the Solicitor\nGeneral in the person of Mr. Kneedler came you to in\nThompson v. Western States and said we need to stop this\ncompounded drug marketing because this is heavily\nregulated; this is a closed market, and the Court said,\nI'm sorry, no. The nature of a marketplace of ideas is\nyou get to say your piece and the other side gets to say\ntheir piece. The FDA heavily regulates this area, the\ninformation is perfectly accurate and it's incredibly\nvaluable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have no\nobjection I take it, if there were not the academic\nexception and if the State didn't -- didn't push its own\ncontrary program?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We would have much less of\nan objection, and that's no accident. Let me just say\nthis is not a flaw in the drafting. The State really\nwanted to push its counter message, and thankfully so.\nThis government has a real interest here. Insurers have\na real interest here, but so does the other side of the\ndebate, and what the State doesn't get to do is just\npick sides and prevent the debate from happening.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would -- if you\nwere truly concerned about physician privacy -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You didn't want\npeople to know that this physician prescribed this drug\nmore often because it tells you a lot about his\npractice -\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that he may not\nwant known, how would you -- how would you write this\nstatute?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You would take Justice\nKennedy's hypothetical, and I don't think the Court has\nto confront whether such a statute would be\nconstitutional because it would be very different.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you remind me\nwhat Justice Kennedy said?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. He said the rule is\nthe pharmacy can't give it to anybody.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Who's -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How about the pharmacy can't\nsell it to anybody?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand why that protects privacy. That protects\nagainst commercialization, but I don't think the\ngovernment has nearly as much interest in\ncommercialization as it does in actual privacy. Section\n652D of the restatement of torts doesn't talk about the\noutrage of being able to use -- we have a capitalist\neconomy, and we sell newspapers and books and that sort\nof thing. Commercialization isn't a bad thing. It's a\nquestion of whether privacy is genuinely protected.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you do it -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not exactly not this\ncase but just in the abstract, do we have a rule that if\nthere are two statutes, A, the statute is passed for a\nbad purpose, B, the statute is not passed for a bad\npurpose, if the statute is otherwise the same, are they\nboth unconstitutional or just one and why? And what\ncase do I look to other than maybe Church of Lukumi?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You look to -- yes, we\nwin -- Thompson v. Western States. Remember what the\ngovernment's argument there was: If you allow the\nmarketing of compounded drugs that are not FDA approved\nyou will evade the very important FDA regulatory\nprogram. That was a perfectly important rationale, and\nthe Court said but it also has the purpose of keeping\ninformation out of the hands of doctors. It's\nunconstitutional.\nI'll give you another example. Grosjean,\nMinneapolis Star and -- Raglan -- those are cases about\ntaxing the instruments of communication. So a tax on\nnewsprint, a tax on ink; and the Court said we're not\nworried about your bad motive, you have a very important\nrationale in trying to raise revenue, that's a perfectly\nvalid purpose; but what you're also doing is you're\npicking out the press and you're making it harder to\nspeak; it's unconstitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This -- this is, Mr.\nKneedler explained this is the government's information.\nWhy can't -- you wouldn't have to have it if it weren't\nprescription. It was the fact that it has to be\nprescribed that requires this information. The\ngovernment frequently controls the use to which\ninformation can be put. It makes me file a tax return,\nand it doesn't allow, you know, dissemination of that.\nIt restricts it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably it\ncould say that if an accountant prepares my tax return,\nthat accountant can't sell it, either.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is this any\ndifferent?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, okay. Two pieces to the\npuzzle. The first is why can't I demand it from the\nIRS? Okay? And second is going to be why can't the\naccountant give it away? The first one is LAPD, and\nit's the same true -- the same thing is true of campaign\nfinance reports. The government has plenary authority;\nwhen you give information to the government, what the\ngovernment then does with the information.\nThe important lesson to be derived from LAPD\nis that nine members of the Court seemingly agreed -\nand I defended the statute in that case -- nine members\nof the court in that case agreed that if this had been\nprivate reports rather than the government's reports,\nthen the statute would have been unconstitutional.\nThe reason your tax preparer can't give it\naway, the reason I can't give away attorney-client\nsecrets, the reason that the government is going to be\nable to tell Internet companies that they can't give\nawait the consumer information is that it's really\nprivate. But what if, instead, the government had a\nrule that says tax preparers can't give out tax\ninformation when it will encourage people to protest\nagainst their taxes? But if it will encourage people to\ncomply with their taxes, it's perfectly fine. You can't\ndraw lines that are intended to discriminate against\nspeakers. That's the main principle of our case.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Asay, you have five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ASAY: I would like to begin with the\npoint that my friend was making about the use of the\ninformation by insurance companies. Insurers are not\nsimilarly situated to pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nInsurers receive information directly from doctors and\nparents in the ordinary course of their business and\nthey use it as part of providing and paying for care to\npatients.\nAnd when my friend described the fact that\ninsurers do that with doctors' information as speaker\ndiscrimination, I would like to point out that -- the -\nnot only the record but the examples, for example, that\nPhRMA points to on page 126 their brief show that\ninsurers have patient information for that purpose as\nwell. HIPAA allows those uses of both patient and\nprescriber information to manage benefits.\nSo, to argue that pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers are being discriminated against if they\ndon't have access to the same health care information\nthat we provide to our insurance companies would -\nwould begin to raise serious questions about a statute\nlike HIPAA. And that -- that just highlights that in\nthis area of -- of private information and information\ncontrol that many of these statutes are structured in\nsuch a way that there are expected and intended and\npermissible uses of information, and other uses for\nwhich people are allowed to have control over the\nfurther use of their information. And here we're\ntalking about the control allotted to doctors.\nWe place an enormous amount of trust in\ndoctors to make the right treatment decisions for their\npatients. Part of their ability to make that, those\ndecisions depends on the information that they receive.\nAnd what doctors have said to the Vermont legislature\nand to the Court in this case is that many of them find\nthis practice objectionable and that it is not helpful\nto them or to their patients to have their information\nmonitored for this marketing purpose. And all that they\nhave asked for is the right to object. And I would like\nto -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Asay, I want to\ngive you the chance to respond to a point that was\nhighlighted by your friend, which is the fourth\nlegislative finding, which does seem to say that the\nState is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance\nin the marketplace of ideas.\nMS. ASAY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe findings, first of all, have to be taken\nas they were adopted, which was in support of not this\nstatute even as it was written, but as a much larger\nbill that contained many sections, including a provision\nthat created the evidence based education program which\nis a -- a clinical -- a -- a program to provide\nvoluntary education to doctors, and to the statute as it\nused to be written, which -- which not only had this\nprovision for the doctors' choice and the use of the\ninformation, but also mandated that pharmaceutical\ndetailers provide information affirmatively as part of\nthe marketing process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have -- were\nthere -- were there findings with respect to the statute\nas enacted?\nMS. ASAY: There are no findings that\naccompany the amendment that resulted in this statute.\nAnd to -- to return to, I think Justice\nKennedy's point from earlier, the statute, I think, has\nto stand or fall on the restriction that it -- that it\nallows for doctors. The Court, for example, in O'Brien\ndiscussed the fact that striking down a statute because\nthe court disagreed with the record would -- would\nsimply mean that the legislature could adopt the same\nstatute again on a different record.\nWe would say here that what -- what's -- the\nquestion before the Court really is, may doctors have\nthis opportunity to control the use of their information\nabout -- their nonpublic information about their\nprescribing practices as a marketing tool or not, and\nthat -- that -- that should be the -- the focus of the\nCourt's inquiry.\nI would also like to just return to the\npoint that -- that I believe I was making earlier that\nthis statute is so different from the cases in which the\nCourt has considered restrictions on the direct\ncommercial advertising and the provision of information\nto the public.\nThis is an entirely nonpublic commercial\ntransmission of data. It -- it starts with a private\ncommercial transaction, it's a private commercial\nexchange between the data vendors and the pharmacies.\nIt's used in a way that it is never disclosed publicly,\nnever included in the advertising message. There's no\nrestriction here on the information that's provided to\ndoctors. The truthful information that the FDA permits\nto be provided about prescription drugs. And there's no\nrestriction on any exchange between a willing listener\nand a willing speaker.\nI believe my friend suggested that -- that\nanyone could call a doctor's office and find out by\nasking what the doctor prescribed. Pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers can do that as well. And if the doctor\nvolunteers that information, there can be that exchange\nof information. The statute does not restrict it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it there's -\nthere's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I\nwant you to fill this prescription in a particular\nplace, a particular pharmacy because I know that\npharmacy doesn't sell the information. They can't do\nthat, can they?\nMS. ASAY: I don't believe they can, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
