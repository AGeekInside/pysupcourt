        "content": "(11:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-1770, the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment v. Pearlie Rucker and a related case.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nConfronted with the problem, an undisputed\nproblem, of severe violence and drug crimes and other\ncrimes in public housing, Congress enacted the statute at\nissue in this case. The statute provides that public\nhousing leases must provide that any drug-related criminal\nactivity engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member\nof the tenant's household, or any guest or other person\nunder the tenant's control shall be cause for termination\nof tenancy. It sets forth the conditions by which the\nhousehold may possess and occupy Government property,\nproperty that is largely financed by the Federal\nGovernment.\nHUD has construed that statute, in accordance\nwith its terms, to authorize termination of the tenancy\nwhen the drug-related criminal activity by one of the\nnamed persons occurs without regard to the tenant's\nknowledge or control.\nQUESTION: Do you have any question about the\nrespondent's standing to contest the provisions that -- of\na lease that's made between HUD and the housing --\nMR. FELDMAN: The -- what happened in the\ndistrict court in this case, if I can just answer it this\nway, is there was a -- we suggested that the court should\nabstain, and this whole thing should be litigated in the\nlocal courts in the unlawful detainer action. The court\nrefused to do so on the ground that this was in part an\nadministrative procedure action against HUD and that HUD\nwouldn't have been a party in the local court. That issue\nwasn't raised further on appeal and we didn't raise it in\nour petition for cert.\nI'm not sure if that answers the question or\nnot, but -- in any --\nQUESTION: Is the -- is the issue jurisdiction?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, I don't -- I don't think it is\njurisdictional. The question about whether there's a\ncause of action under the APA, for example, is not -- is\nnot a jurisdictional issue, nor is abstention.\nAnyway, HUD has construed the statute in\naccordance with its terms, to authorize termination of the\ntenancy when there's drug-related criminal activity\nregardless of the tenant's knowledge or control. The\ncourt of appeals read into the statute a limitation that\nis nowhere expressed or implied with any of the words that\nCongress used, that a tenancy may only be terminated when\nthe tenant knew or had reason to know of the drug-related\ncriminal activity.\nThe question --\nQUESTION: We read scienter requirements into\ncriminal statutes with some regularity, don't we?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. But there's no -- but this\nis a civil -- this is a contract. It's a civil -- it's a\ncivil case. It's a civil contract. And the law of\ncontracts historically has been that contractual terms can\nbe violated without regard to any inquiry into the state\nof mind of the contracting parties.\nQUESTION: What -- what about other civil\nforfeiture actions? Are you familiar with any -- any\nothers of those that don't contain a scienter requirement?\nMR. FELDMAN: I'm not sure -- well, under\nFederal law, I'm not sure. There is now generally a\nFederal knowledge -- ignorant owner defense under the\nFederal forfeiture statute.\nQUESTION: Was that --\nMR. FELDMAN: State -- in the United States --\nin Bennis against Michigan, I don't think there was such a\n-- there was such a provision.\nBut I think the key point is this is completely\ndifferent from forfeiture. Forfeiture involves someone\nwho has a property interest that the Government had -- has\nnothing to do with and the Government is given the right\nto take that property interest. This is a case where the\ntenants never had a property interest in occupancy of\ntheir -- of their apartment in violation of the lease.\nAnd this is a case in which the Government is saying this\nis our property and we're going to let you use it under\ncertain -- use and occupy it under certain circumstances.\nQUESTION: Is it your position that the\nGovernment can place any terms and conditions whatever on\nleases as long as it doesn't violate some other\nconstitutional provision like the First Amendment?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, I think that is our position.\nQUESTION: And so this is a condition that the\nGovernment has the right to impose. Is that your basic\nposition?\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. And --\nQUESTION: Then you don't need reliance on\nBennis at all.\nMR. FELDMAN: No, no. Our position is this is\nfundamentally different from forfeiture. Forfeiture\ninvolves tens of millions of leasehold and fee interests\nthroughout the country. This involves a -- a much\nnarrower slice of property interests in -- of -- of --\nQUESTION: Whether it involves a narrower or a\nbroader slice really doesn't make any difference. It's\njust a different kind of relationship.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. It's a fundamentally\ndifferent kind of relationship. This is the Government's\nproperty to start off with. It is saying, you can use the\nproperty subject to certain conditions.\nQUESTION: I guess I'm still -- I guess I'm\nstill puzzled by why a tenant can sign a lease and then\nchallenge it. I mean, what's the -- is -- is he saying\nthat Federal law that binds the housing authority is\nsomehow invalid? And how does he have standing to do that\nif the housing authority agrees?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that the tenant's position\n-- I suppose the tenant -- you'd have to ask my opponent,\nbut I think the tenant's position here is that this lease\nprovision which embodies the -- the HUD rule of -- the\nrule that Congress enacted concerning that there was no\ninnocent owner defense, that that is itself not authorized\nby Federal law or not permitted by Federal law and\ntherefore was an invalid condition. I assume that that's\nwhat their position is.\nQUESTION: The position of the Government in --\nin saying that any misuse by any guest, whether on or off\nthe premises, will result in a forfeiture does seem to\noperate in a rather draconian fashion in some of the\nexamples we've been given in the briefs. And one wonders\nwhy the Government wants to take such a -- an extreme\nposition even though it lawfully could.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think most -- I would say that\nmost of the examples that are given in -- that are given\nin the amicus briefs supporting respondent are ones that\nare based on third-hand hearsay, and I'm not sure that\nthey're accurate accounts of those events, but --\nQUESTION: Well, but if they are, they sound\npretty draconian.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the underlying point is\nthat Congress was facing a very serious problem, and it\nhad essentially three choices. It could have said, we are\ngoing to have a Federal zero tolerance policy and that's\nall. It could have done what it did, which is vest local\npublic housing authorities with this tool, a contractual\nprovision that permits them to get people out when there's\na serious problem or -- or when -- when it's necessary to\nensure the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by the other\ntenant. Or it could have adopted a code of under what\ncircumstances you can and can't evict, and then left it up\nto the -- it would be leave -- left up to the courts to\nsee whether the particular facts satisfy that code or\ndon't satisfy that code.\nI think Congress took the only course that was\nworkable. If they -- if Congress had gone farther and if\nCongress had enacted the statute that the court of appeals\nthinks it enacted, then it would not be much of a tool for\npublic housing authorities because in each case, the\nquestion, for example, of the tenant's knowledge would be\nlitigated. The tenant would likely deny knowledge. The\nhousehold members would deny knowledge. The whole thing\nwouldn't --\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, how can you say that's\nso when the district court -- the injunction was he's\ndrawing a line between on premises and off premises. And\nthe injunction doesn't cover anything that happens on the\npremises. As far as that's concerned, the eviction holds.\nSo, it's only the cases where the third person does a drug\ndeal or whatever off premises. And we had one case in the\nparking lot, another case in a bar. But as far as inside\nthe premises, there is no case being made. There's --\nnobody is saying that -- at least as I understand it, that\nthe district judge didn't go far enough.\nMR. FELDMAN: That -- that's correct. But the\nproblem is that in fact drug-related criminal activity\nthat occurs, for example, in the parking lot of a housing\nproject can be more threatening to the peaceful enjoyment\nof the premises by the other tenants than what would --\nmight occur in the apartment. And the same with conduct\nthat occurs nearby.\nI think the point is that Congress was faced\nwith it and public housing authorities were faced with the\nproblem of very serious violence that the court of appeals\nsaid that public housing projects in many areas had become\nwar zones and drug markets. And they wanted a -- a\npractical, effective way to be sure that public housing\nauthorities can take those households that are causing the\nproblem and remove them and replace them with other\nhouseholds of the many, many households who are on the\nwaiting list and who wouldn't cause the problems.\nQUESTION: But you say this is -- a housing\nauthority may not must.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And I think in your brief, as well as\nin Judge O'Scannlain's opinion for the original panel,\nthere was a suggestion that the housing authority should\nbe equitable in the way it administers it, that it\nshouldn't evict every time it theoretically could. And my\nquestion to you is, in recommending that kind of equitable\ndiscretion to be exercised, do you envision that to be an\nunreviewable discretion or would there be court review of\nthe housing authority's determination, say, in these cases\nnot to exercise equitable discretion?\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think there would be\nbecause I think Congress -- the way the scheme works is\nthis is a provision in a lease which is a sort of\ncontract. And there is -- the law of contracts is that a\ncontracting party may enforce its lease -- its lease\nprovisions -- Congress was surely aware of that -- when it\nwants. And ordinarily whether it's a Federal contract, a\ngovernment contract, or a private contract, the court\ndoesn't inquire into what are the reasons why you're\nenforcing your -- your lease provision here. They just\ninquire -- or your contractual provision. They just\ninquire has the contract been breached or has it not been\nbreached. And I think again that that was the only\nworkable way for this scheme to work.\nNow, in some instances, there may be a public\nhousing authority faced with some of the really extreme\nconditions that came out in congressional hearings and\nthat are discussed throughout the papers here that may\ndecide that a zero tolerance policy is the only way to\nassure that this -- the drugs are going to be cleaned out\nof the housing unit and that the housing -- the households\nthat are causing the problem are going to be replaced with\nsome of the other ones on the waiting list that won't\ncause the problem.\nQUESTION: Do I understand --\nMR. FELDMAN: There -- there might be other\ncases where that's not appropriate.\nQUESTION: But you did take the position that\nhere and now with this, that the housing authority should\nnot evict automatically, that they should do it on a case-\nby-case basis. Or am I wrong in saying --\nMR. FELDMAN: I think what -- well, you know, I\nhesitate to say yes to that because I think what -- our\nposition is that the housing authority has the discretion\nto enforce these provisions or not, and there may be cases\nwhere zero tolerance policy is necessary or required, in\nwhich case that's what they should do.\nQUESTION: But the discretion is unreviewable\nand in the -- in the final analysis, as I understand your\nargument, it doesn't have to exercise any discretion at\nall. It can zero tolerance across the board.\nMR. FELDMAN: They -- it could say zero\ntolerance across the board.\nQUESTION: And if -- if you say it's reviewable\nby the courts, talk about an unworkable system. That\nwould be it.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct because you -- with\nrespect to the particular issue of knowledge that's at\nissue here, as I said, it's going to be very hard for a\nhousing authority, which is not a criminal prosecution\nagency -- they're in the business of running housing --\nhousing developments, not prosecuting crimes -- to prove\nwho had exactly what state of mind or who had what level\nof control.\nIndeed, both respondents in the court of appeals\nsuggest that if the tenant -- even if the tenant knew, if\nthe tenant couldn't control the drug-related activity,\nthat that would also be a defense. Well, that would, in\nsome cases, allow exactly the families and the households\nthat are causing the biggest problem for the -- for their\n-- for their neighbors and for the truly innocent tenants\nto remain, and there would be nothing the public housing\nauthority could do.\nBut I think, in general, what Congress wanted\nwas to give public housing authorities a tool that would\nbe actually useful in remedying the very serious problem\nof not only drug -- drug-related criminal activity but\nother criminal activity in public housing units.\nThe underlying principle really is one of\nhousehold-wide responsibility. No one -- no one suggests\nthat if the -- everybody agrees, let me put it that way,\nthat if the tenant is -- engages in drug-related criminal\nactivity, that the whole household can be removed from the\nunit. But in a very real sense, although the legal\nrelationship is between the housing authority and the\ntenant, the practical relationship is they're giving that\nwhole household the right to occupy the Government\npremises. And it's just the very same rule. It's whoever\nin that household has used -- has engaged in criminal\ndrug-related activity, that person is liable to be removed\nfrom the tenancy because it -- that person violated a\nlease term.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, how do you answer that\nthe statute doesn't say anything about the duration of\ntime or the place? I mean, the hypothetical that the --\nlet's say the grandson could have dealt with drugs 5 years\nago or could have done it in L.A. and this housing project\nis in Massachusetts.\nMR. FELDMAN: In terms of time, I think that\nthere -- generally the statute doesn't say anything about\ntime, and I think it would be open to HUD to fill in a --\nin a gap, although certainly a very broad period of time\nwould be -- would be suggested. It wouldn't be a very\nshort --\nQUESTION: But you're saying the part of the\nunreviewable discretion is it could be 5 years ago.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's -- that's correct, but that\n-- that -- it was not -- the issue of time and place --\nand let me say place is addressed in the statute because\nCongress -- originally it said on or near, and Congress\namended in 1996 to say on or off. So, the one thing we do\nknow is that place is not something that was relevant.\nAnd again -- actually if I can turn to place for\na second, you could have a drug crime that occurs 3,000\nmiles away, and ordinarily -- and I think it would never\nbe -- I don't know of any case where anyone has been tried\nto be evicted. It's a very theoretical possibility that\nanybody would be. But if that crime was that that person\nwas trying to import drugs and bring them to that person's\nunit in the housing complex, it would be highly relevant.\nAnd what Congress intended was that public housing\nauthorities have the tool to take care of the problems\nthat they saw. They're not evicting people who are -- who\nare engaged in drug crimes 3,000 miles away or 20 years\nbefore.\nRespondents rely and the court of appeals relied\non the forfeiture provision. I've already said that the\nforfeiture raises a completely different issue. And the\nfact that -- it is true that Congress added leasehold\ninterest to the forfeiture statute in it -- when it --\nwhen it rewrote this statute in 1990, although it didn't\nsubstantively change the terms of the statute. But I\nthink the -- it's very express innocent owner defense\nthat's in the lease -- in the forfeiture statute contrasts\nvery sharply with the absence of not only any such defense\nbut even any word that suggests such a defense in this\nstatute.\nThe doctrine of in pari materia, which they\nappeal to, can sometimes be used where you have a\nparticular term in a statute that in a closely related\nstatute is either defined or, by context, has a very clear\nmeaning and the same meaning then is -- is imported. It's\nquite a different thing here where -- this is a -- the\nforfeiture statute is entirely different from --\nQUESTION: Well, it runs up against expressio\nunius too, doesn't it --\nMR. FELDMAN: Right.\nQUESTION: -- as a --\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, and -- and I think in this\ncase where there's no word in this statute that requires\nthat -- that requires interpretation and the context that\nyou're trying to take the meaning from is quite a -- an\nentirely different context, I don't think that that in\npari materia is soundly applied. In fact, I think just\nthe contrast between the statutes clearly points out\nCongress' -- what Congress intended.\nThe -- the -- you know, I'd add that this --\nthis -- the rationale of this statute ensures not only\nthat there's the maximum incentive for tenants in public\nhousing to ensure that their household members and they\nthemselves are not engaged in drug-related activity and to\nfind out about that activity rather than remaining\nignorant, but in the end, it ensures that households in\nGovernment subsidized housing who are a threat to their\nneighbors or who may be a threat to their neighbors in the\nview of the public housing authority, that they are\nremoved and that -- and replaced with others of the many\nfamilies who are on the list who would not pose such a\nthreat.\nFinally, the court of appeals also relied on the\ndoctrine of constitutional avoidance, but this statute is\nclear and there's no warrant for applying that doctrine.\nAnd in any event, there isn't any serious constitutional\nproblem with interpreting it as HUD has. Although the\ntenants have a property interest in their lease, that is\n-- that entitles them to the right to the full procedural\ndue process protections before the lease is terminated,\nbut it doesn't govern what the substantive terms of the\nlease are.\nQUESTION: They can litigate that in the\nunlawful detainer action.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right, and they have the\nright to litigate all of the issues that would come up in\nthe unlawful detainer action, but it doesn't -- the -- the\nfact that they have a property interest in their lease\ndoesn't, in turn, give them a property interest in acting\nin ways substantively that are contrary to the terms of\ntheir lease.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Lafayette, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY T. LAFAYETTE\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS\nMR. LAFAYETTE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn response to Congress' enactment of\n1437d(l)(6) and HUD's regulations, the Oakland Housing\nAuthority revised its lease to properly reflect the\nchanges that had taken place with regard to the HUD\nregulations. And it specifically did that in three\ninstances. It revised the lease at paragraph 9(m) and it\nrevised the occupants' responsibility statement, and then\nit revised what is known as the tenant agreement to\nmaintain a drug-free environment.\nIn each instance, it -- it advised each tenant\nand requested each tenant to sign a statement\nacknowledging that they clearly understood that if this\ntype of conduct took place within their apartment or off\nhousing authority property, that they could be subjected\nto a lease cancellation.\nIn this case, we came forward with four\nindividuals whose leases were canceled because of this\nparticular type of activity. And the housing authority's\nposition is it was necessary for it to take the action\nwith regard to each one of these particular individuals\nbecause of the conduct that they were participating in or\nthe conduct of individuals in their households were\nparticipating in, which conduct which posed a significant\nrisk of injury to other members of the housing authority\nand to the community in which these particular\ndevelopments are located.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lafayette, how big a problem is\nthis in this housing authority?\nMR. LAFAYETTE: It's a -- it's a significant\nproblem. One of the things that we've pointed out in our\nmoving -- in -- in our merits brief was that this is a\nhousing authority that has approximately 8,000 individuals\nwho are scattered in 3,308 low income to moderate income\nhousing units. From 1998 until November of this past\nyear, there were 700 felony arrests for drug-related\ncriminal activity in or near Oakland Housing Authority\nproperty. Significantly, between January 1, 2001 and\nNovember 6, 2001, the number of felony arrests was 250 for\ndrug-related activity. That's a significant sum.\nOne of the things that I think is also\nsignificant is that this is a housing authority that does\nnot necessarily have large housing development complexes.\nA number of its developments are smaller units. For\nexample, in the Hill and Lee cases, those are individuals\nwho resided in -- in a development that is approximately\neight units, eight units in a neighborhood that is\ncomprised almost exclusively of single family dwellings.\nWhen these individuals participate in this drug activity\nin the front of that unit, it is not only affecting the\nmembers of the housing authority community itself, it is\naffecting the general community at large and all the\nindividuals there.\nAnd significantly we need to point out that we\nresponded there not because we happened to be driving by,\nbut the response was -- was premised on a complaint being\nmade. And that's part of the record. So, what's\nhappening is this housing authority is responding to\ncomplaints made by residents, and one of the things that\nwe point out is this housing authority has been subjected\nto litigation by -- being made by its residents demanding\nthat the housing authority take more affirmative action\nand steps to address these issues of drug and drug-related\nactivity.\nIn -- it seems to me -- to me that there is no\nissue that in each one of these particular cases there was\njust cause for the housing authority to go forward and --\nand to exercise this discretion reasonably and that it did\nso. And one of the things that -- that seems to appear is\nthe question of whether or not it is exercising\ndiscretion, and we always point the Court to the case of\nPearlie Rucker because that's a case where the housing\nauthority initially proceeded with termination of that\nlease and, in the process of doing so, came to understand\nthat the individual in the household who was participating\nin the drug activity, Gelinda Rucker, was a person who had\nactually become incarcerated and therefore no longer posed\na risk of injury to the remainder of the housing authority\nor the community. Realizing that, the agency at that\npoint discontinued its efforts to dismiss that -- to\nterminate that lease. And at the time this lawsuit was\nactually filed, there was no longer a pending dispute\nbetween the housing authority and Pearlie Rucker who was\nthe -- who was the tenant responsible for that lease.\nQUESTION: But that was not required of the\nhousing authority, and if they had gone and said, well, we\ndon't care that circumstances have changed, out you go,\nthat would be unreviewable.\nMR. LAFAYETTE: That would be unreviewable. And\nthe reason for that is the housing authority needs the\ndiscretion to act where it believes it is necessary for it\nto act. And in each one of these instances, this housing\nauthority has come forward with that position. And\nwithout that discretion, a housing authority would be\nstrapped to look for and to document events that require\nit to move or compel it to move or would set some -- would\nmeet someone else's satisfaction of when it should move.\nAnd those things may not be present from the information\nthat it might have before it.\nThe -- and one of the things we think that --\nthat Congress recognized, that housing authorities are not\nas well equipped as are the Federal Government in order to\nrespond to these types of issues, particularly with regard\nto the loss of additional funds to cities. With that in\nmind, it is significant that this housing authority has\nresponded in the way that it has responded.\nWe -- we have -- have listened to the Solicitor\nGeneral's discussion this morning, and we are in accord\nwith regard to the position that he has taken with regard\nto what Congress intended and how Congress went about\nevaluating the various needs of residents of public\nhousing.\nOne of the things that I think that needs to be\nclearly stated is that the housing authority itself does\nnot benefit from a statute like this because the housing\nauthority is only going to take that apartment unit and to\nre-lease that apartment unit out to someone else who is in\nneed of low income public housing. The housing authority\nhas this provision in its lease because, one, there --\nit's required by the HUD regulations, and number two, it\nneeds to be able to provide its residents with safe and\ndecent housing, which is what this is really all about, is\nhow it goes about providing safe and decent housing.\nQUESTION: Do you take the position that you\ncould have this provision in the lease even without the\nFederal statute?\nMR. LAFAYETTE: There is nothing that restrains\nus from putting this provision in this lease before that.\nAnd in fact, prior to -- though not part of the record,\nprior to this provision being enacted by Congress, there\nwas a similar provision in the lease itself. It just did\nnot embrace the concept of activity off of housing\nauthority property. The provision was amended after the\n-- after Congress acted.\nQUESTION: That -- that in premises has not --\nhas never been an issue in this case, I take it.\nMR. LAFAYETTE: In premises has not, but in\npremises alone does not address the problem with regard to\nthis type of activity in public housing. It's not\nunforeseeable that individuals who participate in this\nconduct off premises may not lead those who have issues\nwith them onto housing authority property and thereby\njeopardize the interest and the -- the right to enjoyment\nof the other residents.\nWith that, I'll reserve the rest of my time\nfor --\nQUESTION: May I ask one question, if you're\nthrough? Is there any procedure at all to -- I'm pointing\n-- I'm referring to the fact that the housing authority\nhas such broad discretion. They can not only make\ncharges, but they can decide to waive them. Is there any\nprocedure at all to be sure that that power isn't abused\nby waiving it in cases of all Democrats but enforcing it\nfor all Republicans or something like that?\nMR. LAFAYETTE: There -- there isn't a procedure\nin place for anyone to review these decisions based on\nsome arbitrariness standard. No, there isn't.\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean, in the precise\ninstance that Justice Stevens gave you, that would be a\nconstitutional violation, wouldn't it?\nMR. LAFAYETTE: If --\nQUESTION: And you -- you would have judicial\nreview for -- for violation of some constitutional\nprovision.\nMR. LAFAYETTE: It's foreseeable if there is a\nconstitutional issue. If, for example, this -- this\npolicy is only being used against people of a particular\nrace --\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMR. LAFAYETTE: -- then those issues could be\nreviewable.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. LAFAYETTE: But --\nQUESTION: What? In a 1983 action against the\nhousing authority? Is that what -- what would -- how\nwould it be?\nMR. LAFAYETTE: That could be and it could be a\n1983 violation against the housing authority.\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't it have to be on your\nview? Wouldn't it have to be in a separate 1983 action on\nthe -- on the view that you take?\nMR. LAFAYETTE: It could be -- landlord-tenant\ndisputes in California are summary proceedings which\nparticularly dovetail into the issues in dispute, and it\nprobably would be a separate action as a 1983 claim. But\none of the things we don't have here is a claim that says\nthat these individuals are being singled out for lease\ncancellation because of their race or some other suspect\nclassification.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lafayette.\nMr. Renne, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. RENNE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. RENNE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nIn this case, as we've heard in -- in the\nargument of HUD is that HUD says, by reason of this lease\nprovision, which Congress mandated in section 1437d(l)(6),\nit is the judge and jury as to whether or not innocent\ntenants, such as the -- the respondents who are before\nthis Court, whether they can be summarily evicted from\ntheir homes.\nQUESTION: Well, that doesn't really differ from\nthe role of any landlord in a landlord-tenant situation,\ndoes it?\nMR. RENNE: Yes, Your -- Chief Justice, it does\nbecause what they're saying is that there can be no\ndefenses raised in the eviction proceeding other than an\nattack on whether or not there was a drug-related\nviolation.\nQUESTION: Well, but as the Chief Justice points\nout, that's true in -- I've drafted many leases and we\nhave clauses --\nQUESTION: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- that this premises is used for\ncommercial purposes.\nQUESTION: Regional eighths.\nQUESTION: The lease is void and that's -- and\nthat's it. Now, you may say that -- you can argue about\nwhether or not the -- the provision itself was violated,\nbut I know of no authority where it says where the lessor\ncan't exercise this option.\nMR. RENNE: Justice Kennedy, under most State\nlaws, the eviction court has a right to make a\ndetermination whether under all the facts and\ncircumstances to -- to terminate the lease would be, for\nexample, a forfeiture because of the violation not being\nsufficient or the circumstances such as -- that don't\nbring it under those terms.\nNow, what -- and interesting enough, we heard\nnothing about it, but Congress also mandated --\nQUESTION: We just don't have before us a\nquestion in which you're contesting that the drug activity\noccurred.\nMR. RENNE: Yes, but the Congress mandated that\nin any action taken to evict, HUD, or the Oakland Housing\nAuthority in this case, had to provide some grievance\nmechanism of an independent evaluation whether eviction\nshould occur. However, it said that HUD can grant due\nprocess exemptions under the circumstances where HUD makes\nan affirmative determination that the eviction court\nprovides due process to the tenant.\nQUESTION: This wasn't the basis of the Ninth\nCircuit's decision, was it?\nMR. RENNE: Yes. The -- the Ninth Circuit talks\nin terms of the -- of the opportunity to present defenses.\nNow, what the Ninth Circuit was going on, it was\nsaying that there's nothing in the statute -- and it was\nCongress' intent not to take away an innocent tenant\ndefense. And that would be presented to the eviction\ncourt. And Congress has provided for the eviction court\nto have a right to hear all legal and equitable defenses.\nQUESTION: Well, this doesn't sound to me like\nthe Ninth Circuit's reasoning at all. Perhaps I'm\nmistaken.\nMR. RENNE: Well, it -- it is, Your Honor, if\nyou look at what the Ninth Circuit is saying. The Ninth\nCircuit is saying that that section does not take away an\ninnocent tenant defense.\nQUESTION: Where does it come from in the first\nplace?\nQUESTION: Well, where did -- exactly. Where\ndid it come from in the first place?\nMR. RENNE: The innocent tenant defense?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. RENNE: From the -- the statute which\nprovides that in eviction proceedings, the eviction court\nshall provide an opportunity for the tenant to present all\nlegal and equitable defenses.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the question is whether or\nnot this is a legal defense.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's the only question before us.\nMR. RENNE: That's correct. And, Your Honor, it\nis our position that it is a legal defense that is\nrecognized in most State court proceedings.\nQUESTION: But it's not recognized in the\nFederal statute or in the regulations. That's the\nproblem. This is manufactured by the Ninth Circuit. It\nisn't there.\nMR. RENNE: The -- the statute doesn't say\nanything about defenses. The statute is only saying\nhere's a lease provision that you shall put into the\nlease. HUD's own regulations say, if you want to enforce\nit, you have to go to an eviction court, and the eviction\ncourt has a right to consider all equitable legal\ndefenses.\nQUESTION: But these tenants didn't let it get\nto that stage. They preempted it and filed some kind of a\nsuit to get an injunction before there had ever been a\nproceeding.\nMR. RENNE: That's correct. And that was on the\npoint that it was a violation of the -- of what power\nCongress had given HUD to interpret the statute which is\ntotally silent. It says nothing about defenses. And when\nyou look at what happened at the same time when Congress\nenacted that particular provision in 1988, it was the same\ntime in which it took public housing leases, put them\nunder the forfeiture statute, and said under forfeiture\nstatutes, you must provide an innocent tenant defense.\nQUESTION: Why didn't it say that here? I mean,\nyou -- this suggests that when Congress said nothing about\nthe defense here, it meant the defense didn't exist.\nWhere it wanted the defense --\nQUESTION: It put it in.\nQUESTION: -- it specified it. And you say they\nsay nothing about it. They say nothing about it because\nit didn't exist.\nMR. RENNE: I -- I submit the reason why they\ndidn't is because landlord-tenant law is a -- in public\nhousing is a amalgamation of Federal and State law, and\nthat's well recognized in all the cases. They knew, at\nthe time that they passed section 1437d(l)(6), that there\nwas also the provisions that said legal and equitable\ndefenses may be presented. They were not -- they were not\nfocusing on what defenses are available.\nQUESTION: These provisions are -- that say\nlegal and equitable defense can be presented are -- appear\nin Federal law or in State law?\nMR. RENNE: They appear in HUD's regulations.\nIn the -- they can only grant a due process exemption if\nthey find that the State eviction court gives the tenant\nan opportunity to present legal and equitable defenses.\nCongress, when it was passes -- passing section\n1437 --\nQUESTION: And you think this is an\nauthorization for all sorts of defenses?\nMR. RENNE: Absolutely. Whatever defenses are\nrecognized by the eviction court.\nQUESTION: Then you are going considerably\nbeyond where the district court left off. And the\ndistrict court made a distinction between on premises and\noff premises, and it didn't give any injunction with\nrespect to on premises. Your argument doesn't have that\nlimitation. Your argument is equitable defense of\ninnocence; I didn't know. And it doesn't draw any line at\nall between in and off premises. So, you are asking this\nCourt to take -- to state a rule of law that would go\nconsiderably beyond the district court injunction that was\nthen reviewed by the Ninth Circuit. You're asking us, in\n-- in effect, to reverse the district court because it\ndidn't go far enough, if I understand your argument.\nMR. RENNE: I believe you are correct, Justice\nGinsburg, that we believe that that defense of a totally\ninnocent tenant should be available whether the offense\noccurred off or on the premises just as it does in the\nforfeiture statute.\nQUESTION: Did you object in the Ninth Circuit\nbecause the district court didn't go far enough?\nMR. RENNE: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: A very odd procedural posture you're\nin. You're trying to overturn your victory in the\ndistrict court.\nMR. RENNE: I'm not trying to overturn it, Your\nHonor, I suggest, but I would be perfectly happy if this\nCourt addressed just the off premises, which is what the\ndistrict court held. But the whole --\nQUESTION: But you say there's no logical line\nthat one could draw. On your -- if your theory is\ninnocent tenant is a defense, then how can you defend that\ndefense for off premises only?\nMR. RENNE: The -- the Ninth Circuit didn't draw\nthat line either. The Ninth Circuit took the position\nthat the innocent tenant defense was not precluded and in\nfact was preserved under that --\nQUESTION: I thought the Ninth Circuit affirmed\nthe district court's judgment.\nMR. RENNE: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And the district court said the --\nthere is no problem with on premises. Off premises is\nwhat's unreasonable.\nMR. RENNE: What the district court said is, I'm\nnot going to issue an injunction for on premises. Might I\nrespectfully submit what the court was saying there was\nthat the balancing and the clearness of the likelihood of\nprevailing was not necessarily clear as he felt it was at\nthe -- at the off premises, so that in the context of a\npreliminary injunction, he did not make a ruling as a\nmatter of law at the end of the day that that -- that he\nwould adhere to the position that he was taking for\npurposes of the injunction.\nQUESTION: But you said there's no difference at\nall. So, it would be just as arbitrary. I mean, if -- if\nyou say innocent -- innocence is the defense, the innocent\ntenant, then whether it's preliminary injunction or\npermanent injunction, it's a line that you say cannot\nlogically stand.\nMR. RENNE: On the facts that were before the\ndistrict court judge, all he had to deal with, for\npurposes of the injunction, was the -- the off premises.\nAnd I respectfully submit it's not a final judgment that\nhe was addressing. He was addressing what's the\nlikelihood of success.\nAdmittedly -- and I don't -- I think we all\nrecognize that if there's an offense on the premises, the\nlikelihood of a innocent tenant defense being successful\nis far less, but in the case where you have someone, like\nthe three female respondents in this case who are long-\ntime tenants who have had no problems -- and certainly the\nOakland Housing Authority is not arguing they had problems\nwith them -- and you have a grandson who smokes cigarettes\nin the parking lot, and HUD takes a position -- and\nOakland Housing Authority takes a position that we can\napply some kind of collective guilt because, regardless of\nwhat the Government wants to say and characterize it as a\ncontract action, the end result to these three respondents\nand the innocent -- innocent members of the household is\nto throw them into the streets.\nQUESTION: You think it's irrelevant that the\ntenants signed a contract which specifically provides this\nin the -- in the rider. It's at page 69a of the appendix.\nYou think that that's just irrelevant.\nMR. RENNE: No, Justice Kennedy, it's not\nirrelevant. The --\nQUESTION: I -- I frankly don't understand your\n-- your standing to contest the housing authority's\ninterpretation of a HUD regulation anyway. You just\nsigned a lease that -- that HUD gave you and that's it.\nMR. RENNE: The -- the question is -- and I\nthink the contract question is way circular, that if -- if\nCongress did not mandate that it's an automatic eviction\nwith no opportunity to present any kind of a defense, if\nCongress didn't mandate it, the fact that it's in the\nlease doesn't change it. You still have to get to -- the\nquestion is did section 1437d(l)(6) -- did it mandate?\nAnd it would be the only section of the lease.\nQUESTION: Well, but I'm not sure you're correct\nin your argument there, Mr. Renne, because perhaps you --\nif you had a prohibition against that sort of a thing in\nthe statute, certainly HUD would be bound by it. But with\nno -- no provision one way or the other, certainly that's\nsomething that HUD is entitled to interpret, and it has\ninterpreted it by its regulations.\nMR. RENNE: The -- but it's also, in its\nregulations, said that the tenant has a right in the\neviction court to present equitable and legal defenses.\nQUESTION: But as Justice O'Connor said, you\nnever let it get to the eviction court. The -- it wasn't\nlitigated as to whether the lease should be revoked or\nnot. All that was litigated was whether HUD had a right\nto put this provision in its lease.\nMR. RENNE: I respectfully submit, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that is not what they litigated. They litigated\nthat they did not have a right to terminate -- to\nterminate an innocent tenant, not to put that in their\nlease. That -- there's nobody saying that they can't put\nthe provision in their lease. The question is -- and --\nand nobody is disputing that there is a serious problem of\ndrugs in public housing, and we aren't -- we aren't\nsuggesting anything to the contrary. But I suggest that\nthe respondents and the way they're being treated by the\nOakland Housing Authority are making them victims as well.\nQUESTION: Well, but they're being treated in\naccordance with the provisions of their lease. And you\nordinarily can't come into a court and say, gee, you know,\nyou're putting these tenants out on the street if in fact\nthey've breached their lease in a way that permits the\nlandlord to do that.\nMR. RENNE: But again, with all due respect,\nthat's assuming the answer, and that is that the lease\ndoes say that you can't present an innocent tenant\ndefense. And again I go back to --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a different -- now that\nNinth -- that's -- finally you're talking about something\nthe Ninth Circuit talked about, and it seems to me that\nthat's just absolutely dead wrong. Page 69 of the\nappendix has a rider, a supplemental provision of some\nkind, which makes it crystal clear that there is no\ninnocent defense.\nMR. RENNE: But the -- if you are suggesting\nthat the tenant has any choice in a public housing\nsituation in which the -- the only choice of housing they\nhave is public housing, to say that somehow or other they\nhave agreed to a provision which Congress didn't require.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but now -- now you're\nskating away from the point where we were finally at\nissue. You said the lease doesn't provide this, and --\nbut now your answer is, well, even if it did, it\nshouldn't. I mean, that's just -- that's just not\nresponsive to my point.\nMR. RENNE: My -- Justice Kennedy, what I was\nsaying is that section 1437 of the -- of the statute\ndidn't require the language that they are putting in.\nQUESTION: But under -- under your theory, you\nhave to show not just that it didn't require it, but that\nHUD could not, as an administrative agency, interpret it\nto allow that.\nMR. RENNE: And I believe --\nQUESTION: It seems to me your argument -- when\n-- when you have to argue that point, the argument, as I\nregard the Ninth Circuit opinion, is just extremely weak.\nMR. RENNE: I address that in three ways. One\nis that I believe that when you look at the circumstances\nunder which that section was passed in conjunction with\n881, the forfeiture statute, you look at the -- what\nlittle comments were made by any committees that were\naddressing it, and when you look at the alleged rationale,\nnone of them support HUD. But even more basic, if you\naccept HUD's interpretation, we respectfully submit that\nit raises serious constitutional issues.\nQUESTION: And precisely what are those issues?\nMR. RENNE: The due process issues, Your Honor,\nin that what they are threatening to do is to attach\npunishment and collective guilt, and in American\njurisprudence, we always put individual --\nQUESTION: If you're -- you're saying if you're\n-- if you're evicted from a tenant -- as a tenant from a\npublic housing, you are, A, punished, and B, you're found\ncollectively guilty?\nMR. RENNE: You are certainly being punished,\nand Rucker being thrown out in the street is certainly\nbeing punished.\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then every eviction\nproceeding in the country punishes the tenant. Every\nsuccessful eviction proceeding.\nMR. RENNE: And it's because the tenant has\nsupposedly violated and the eviction court has found,\nbased upon all the evidence that it hears, that eviction\nis appropriate.\nQUESTION: Well, we're just going in circles,\nMr. --\nQUESTION: You -- as I understand the provision\nthat you object to, it -- it says, in effect, the -- the\ntenant who signs the lease is going to be the guarantor\nthat there will be no drug activity in the apartment or by\nother people who are -- are inhabitants or even people who\ncome to the apartment, going to be a guarantor. Are you\nsaying that that kind of a guarantee provision is simply\nforbidden by the Constitution?\nMR. RENNE: Under these circumstances, yes.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. RENNE: In -- for the same reason that I\nbelieve this Court has at least indicated in -- in dicta,\nthat when you are essentially seizing what is property,\nparticularly somebody's home, you must afford them due\nprocess including --\nQUESTION: Well, we're -- now, you're talking\nabout procedural due process, and there's no claim here,\nas I understand it, that the tenants were denied\nprocedural due process. I understand your argument to be\nthat substantive due process forbids this kind of a\nguarantee provision, and when I say why, I'm asking you\nwhy substantively does due process forbid.\nMR. RENNE: And substantively is that you are --\nyou are punishing without any guilt and without allowing\nthe tenant to establish that he or she is innocent.\nQUESTION: So, no one can be made the guarantor\nunder a contract for the conduct of a third person.\nMR. RENNE: Not in public housing --\nQUESTION: -- from the Government. Is that --\nis that --\nMR. RENNE: In the public housing situation.\nQUESTION: Is that your position?\nMR. RENNE: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Then you're challenging something\nthat you have, as I see it, no standing to raise in this\nCourt because I looked back at the district court's\nopinion, and what it said as to conduct occurring in the\ntenant's union -- unit -- it didn't say, well, we just\nwon't extend it preliminarily. It said, eviction under\nsuch circumstances appears rationally related to a\nlegitimate public housing goal and constitutional. It was\na ruling on the merits that as far as the in premises\nsetting is concerned, it was constitutional. And you're\narguing that that's not the case, and I don't see how you\ncan argue that when you haven't filed any cross appeal\never.\nMR. RENNE: Well, with all due respect, Justice\nGinsburg, the cases in this Court have said that\nrespondents are entitled to rely on anything that would\naffirm the judgment below.\nQUESTION: But the judgment below that's being\naffirmed deals only with off premises.\nMR. RENNE: It's the Ninth Circuit judgment that\nis being attacked, and the Ninth Circuit does not limit\nitself in terms of the arguments that it raises and it --\nconclusions it reached --\nQUESTION: Are you not making a distinction\nbetween a judgment and an opinion? I mean, what was\naffirmed was the judgment of the district court.\nMR. RENNE: What was affirmed was the\npreliminary injunction.\nQUESTION: Yes, and that preliminary injunction\nwas only with respect to off premises activity, and that's\nall that the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nMR. RENNE: Yes, I don't disagree with that at\nall.\nBut the rationale of the Ninth Circuit opinion\napplies with equal force because the only thing they had\nbefore them is whether or not the district court had\nabused its discretion in the grant of preliminary\ninjunction.\nBut continuing to address the -- the due process\nis that all we are saying is that these tenants have a\nright to establish that they should not be punished by\nreason of somebody else's conduct without a showing --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I realize that's your\nposition, but in order to maintain that position on a\nsubstantive due process basis, you've got to say, I\nsuppose, that there's no reasonable relationship between\nthis kind of guarantor of conduct provision and the kind\nof drug problem which I presume it is conceded the\nGovernment can deal with. And it seems to me that there's\na pretty obvious substantial relationship between them and\nthat's why your argument doesn't seem to have any sort of\nintuitive plausibility to it. Can you address that?\nMR. RENNE: Well, I don't think that -- when you\nsay it seems to be obvious, with all due respect again, I\nwould say they talk about deterrent. It seems to me that\nMs. Pearlie Rucker who took steps to assure that there\nwere no violations, told her daughter there were no --\nwhat the problems were, and as far as she knew, knew\nnothing about what happened three blocks away from the\napartment.\nQUESTION: Well, she didn't take enough steps\nunder the lease. Under the lease she assured the housing\nauthority that her premises would not be the site of drug\nactivity nor would anybody who brought drug activity into\nthe housing -- into the environs of the housing authority\nbe residing in her --\nMR. RENNE: And --\nQUESTION: Now, she could do that, and you're\nsaying she was blameless. Well, perhaps she was\nblameless, but she didn't do what she had committed to do,\nand that is to make sure that nobody in her apartment\ncaused that place to be a drug area.\nThere seems to me nothing unconstitutional about\nthat, saying we're going to let you in here if you assure\nus that no one who resides in the -- in the premises that\nwe're giving you under this program will be the source of\na drug problem. What's unconstitutional about that?\nMR. RENNE: I suggest that we took -- we take --\ncompare it to the forfeiture statute where we have\nspecifically -- Congress has mandated that in the\nforfeiture situation where the drug offense can be -- on\nthe premises can be horrible, it can be a very serious\ndrug offense, and they cannot forfeit the tenancy.\nQUESTION: Congress has said that. You think\nCongress had to say that?\nMR. RENNE: Yes.\nQUESTION: My goodness. I -- there are many\ninstances under State law where you forfeit an automobile\nwhich is being used for contraband even if you do not know\nthat it's being used. It's your responsibility to make\nsure your car is not used for contraband. That's\nunconstitutional?\nMR. RENNE: And the -- the -- it's not -- this\nCourt has held it is not --\nQUESTION: Not --\nMR. RENNE: -- if there's a nexus either because\nthe automobile was used --\nQUESTION: It's your car. And -- and what the\nState says is when you have a car, it's your\nresponsibility to make sure it's not used for contraband,\nand if it is, we take it away. That's not\nunconstitutional. Why is this any different? In fact,\nthis is a good deal less because it's not even her\npremises. It is a condition of giving her this benefit.\nMR. RENNE: Well, I -- I think the courts\nrecognized that it is her premises. It's her home\nregardless of the fact that it's a public housing or it's\nprivate. And as I believe that this Court has commented\nin opinions that you don't forfeit a house if somebody\nsmokes one marijuana cigarette in it --\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. RENNE: -- even though it may have occurred\non the premises.\nQUESTION: -- forfeiture suggests the Government\ncoming in from the outside and taking the property because\nof criminal activity. Here the Government isn't coming in\nfrom the outside. The Government is the owner of the\nproperty. It is the landlord. And so, you're not talking\nabout the same sort of forfeiture at all.\nMR. RENNE: Well, 881 talks specifically about\npublic housing leases as being subject to forfeiture. So,\nyou are -- in those contexts you're talking about the\nidentical situation that under the forfeiture statute\nsomebody could come in to Ms. Rucker, if she violated some\ncriminal law -- could come and try to forfeit it. But\nit's much easier. Let's get the Oakland Housing Authority\nto come in here and we don't have to show she knew\nanything about it. She could be perfectly innocent, and\nthat is, we submit is fundamentally unfair.\nQUESTION: Does the landlord have some duty to\nprovide a secure -- a secure premises, i.e., secure from\ndrug use?\nMR. RENNE: Yes. And I -- and I submit that\neasily enough to do as they said -- as -- as counsel said\nwith Ms. Rucker. They said, we withdrew the unlawful\ndetainer action, although I might say they didn't withdraw\nthe eviction notice, but they withdrew the unlawful\ndetainer action when the individual who was involved was\nseparated from the premises. That's what we respectfully\nsubmit is -- that's the easy problem in the innocent\ntenant case, is to go to that tenant or to have the tenant\ncome to HUD and say, look, I've got a problem. My son is\n-- is into marijuana and he won't listen to me. I want\nhim removed. Take him off the household list.\nNow, is she going to do it confronted with the\nfact that HUD could say or Oakland Housing Authority could\nsay, well, sorry, Ms. Rucker, rather than ask your\ndaughter to go off, we're going to throw you out? Why\nwould she ever go there?\nQUESTION: The housing authority wants to put\nthe responsibility on her.\nMR. RENNE: Right.\nQUESTION: It wants to put the responsibility on\nthe tenants to make sure that they are not being the cause\nof a drug problem in the facility. It seems to me\nperfectly reasonable, and if she -- if she has been at\nfault in not doing that or even in all innocence hasn't\ndone it properly, nonetheless, she hasn't fulfilled her\nobligation under the lease, which is to make sure that\nnobody on her premises is a source of a problem.\nMR. RENNE: And -- and the best way for -- to\nmake sure that that doesn't happen, that is, that no one\non her household violates a drug law or -- remember, the\nstatute doesn't just relate to drugs. It relates to\ncriminal activity. And as the amicus briefs point out,\nthere -- and -- that there are spouses who are being\nevicted by reason of the fact that they're subject to\nspousal abuse which violates the criminal law. And -- and\nall we're saying is they have to have a chance to go to\nthe eviction court and present that to the eviction court\nso that the eviction court has a right to deal with\nwhether or not there is good cause.\nAnd it's interesting in the -- in the statute\nwe're talking about there is a -- in section 5, it talks\nabout repeated, constant violations and other good cause.\nWhen you get to 6, it only talks about shall be a cause\nfor eviction. Good cause is the thing the eviction court\nshould have a right to deal with, and there's nothing that\nsaid the State law was being preempted.\nI'm suggesting that if -- if what HUD wants is\nto have voluntary cleanup by good people like Ms. Rucker\nand Ms. Hill, Ms. Lee, they should encourage them to say,\ngive us help to make sure that we can live with that\nbecause I think we all know in the real world you're\ntalking about teenage grandsons, people who you don't know\nexactly what they're doing from time to time, and for --\nfor a grandmother to be told the only way you can assure\nyourself is make sure nobody else lives here, it's the\nonly way that -- that these people can assure themselves\nthat they aren't going to get thrown out --\nQUESTION: Well, you're hypothesizing an\nexercise of discretion by HUD that's just not in the\nrecord.\nMR. RENNE: All right. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Renne.\nMr. Feldman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS\nMR. FELDMAN: Thank you.\nI'd first like to add that the -- the people --\nthe people who had committed the drug offenses in this\ncase were between ages 20 and 44 years old. They weren't\nteenagers.\nThe question of -- as to the relationship of --\nof Federal law and the -- the Federal law that waives --\nthat permits HUD to waive the grievance procedure in the\nhousing authority and say you can just go to the eviction\ncourt -- and that law does provide that HUD has to -- it\ncan only permit that if it can ensure -- assure that the\neviction court gives you full due process rights to\nlitigate whatever issues there are. And in that sense,\nFederal law does guarantee you the right to have all of\nyour defenses litigated in the eviction proceeding if HUD\nis going to grant such a waiver, which it's done in 47\nStates.\nQUESTION: And the eviction proceeding is in the\nState court?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, but what Federal law doesn't\ndo is say that there's any particular defenses. As the\nquestion of what the defenses are that you have to have\nthe full right to litigate, that's a question of -- of\nsubstantive Federal law.\nNow, in this case, the statute makes clear I\nthink that serious -- that drug-related criminal activity\nis cause for termination of tenancy, and HUD has construed\nit to mean that.\nNow, the question then about -- the only\npossible source for a defense would be State law, and the\nquestion about for State law defense would be does that\nconflict with either the Federal statute or the purposes\nCongress was trying to achieve. It wouldn't be possible\nfor a State court to disagree with the balance that\nCongress struck when it -- when it passed the statute.\nSo, the only question would be, therefore, if you have any\nState law defenses, they would have to be ones that don't\nconflict with the judgment that Congress made that\neviction under 1437d(l)(6) is for serious -- it's for drug\n-- drug-related criminal activity by a household member.\nI'd like to add just one other point which is in\n42 U.S.C., section 1437, which is kind of the statement of\npolicy right at the beginning of the United States Housing\nAct, it says, it is the policy of the United States -- and\nit names a bunch of things, which I'm not going to read.\nAnd it says, to vest in local public housing agencies the\nmaximum amount of responsibility in the administration of\ntheir housing programs. It was those local public housing\nagencies that know what the conditions are, and that -- it\nis consistent with that that HUD has construed the statute\nand Congress in fact enacted the statute to give them the\ndiscretion with this clause, as with enforcement of rent\nclauses or any other clause, to decide when they should be\nenforced and when they should be enforced. That's not a\nrole for the eviction court.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nFeldman.\n"
