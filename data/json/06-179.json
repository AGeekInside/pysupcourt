        "content": "(10:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 06-179, Riegel v. Medtronic,\nInc.\nMs. Zieve.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ZIEVE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether Section\n360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendment to the Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act preempts State law claims seeking\ndamages for injuries caused by a device that received\npre-market approval. Medtronic's view of the pre-market\napproval process is that it results in an FDA decision\nthat a particular device must be designed, labeled, and\nmanufactured in a particular way. This view is\nincorrect, and so I want to talk -- begin by talking\nabout what pre-market approval is and what it isn't.\nPMA is FDA's permission to market a Class 3 device. The\nmanufacturer PMA device develops the design and chooses\nthe -- choosing it on its own. After the company\nsubmits the application, the FDA evaluates it, based on\ninformation submitted, but it does no independent\ntesting, no product development, no comparison with\nother products to see if this one is as good as or\nbetter than existing products -- or even if it's the\nbest that it can be.\nIf the information submitted by the company\nmeets the statutory standard, reasonable assurance of\nsafety and effectiveness, the FDA grants PMA, thus\npermitting the device to be sold. So the FDA approves\nthe design and labeling chosen by the manufacturer, but\nthe agency doesn't require the manufacturer to choose --\nto make those choices.\nOnce on the market, a PMA device may prove\nto be unsafe, because very often problems and hazards\ncome to light only after the device is in widespread\nuse. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that situation\naddressed by the requirement that the manufacturer alert\nthe FDA to new information and at least file annual\nreports, and then the FDA can pull back the pre-market\napproval if they think these problems require it to do\nso?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, yes and no. The\nrequirement about submitting adverse event reports and\nthe annual report are intended help the FDA to monitor\nthe device after it's on the market. But the\nresponsibility and the opportunity to improve the design\nor labeling or to initiate a recall is really on the\nmanufacturer in the first instance, because the\nmanufacturer is the first one to learn about the\nproblem. The FDA has a more passive role. The FDA\nreceives the information that the manufacturer sends to\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if the manufacturer\nwants to make what you call an improvement? Can it\nsimply market the product with that improvement without\nfurther FDA action?\nMS. ZIEVE: Depending on whether it is a\ndesign or labeling change, the answer is different. For\na labeling change, some changes can be made prior to FDA\napproval. For design changes, any change that affects\nsafety and effectiveness can't be made without a further\nsubmission to the FDA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if it is designed to\nimprove safety and effectiveness?\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right. And in that way a\nPMA device is no different from the 510(k) device that\nthis Court considered in Lohr, because with respect to\nthose devices as well, any change that would have a\nsignificant effect on safety and effectiveness has to\nawait a new submission and a new --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, but those devices\nhad not been -- they were just grandfathered. They had\nnot been specifically approved as safe and effective by\nthe FDA. Right?\nMS. ZIEVE: Right. But the question isn't\nwhat the level of pre-market scrutiny is. The question\nis what requirements are imposed on the manufacturer at\nthe end of the process when the device enters the\nmarket.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, before that decision\nis reached, let me ask you this -- under State law,\neither generally or specifically under the law of the\nState that you are trying to invoke here, does the jury\n-- does the finder of fact weigh the potential risks of\ninjury and illness against the probable benefits to the\nhealth of the patient? Is that one of the things the\njury does? In other words, suppose this was a very\nimportant device, but it had a one percent risk. Does\nthe jury consider that when it determines whether that's\nbeen negligently sold?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the standard in New York\nis whether the product is unreasonably hazardous. I\nthink the term unreasonably --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Alright, now isn't that\nexactly what the FDA measured in the PMA process? The\nFDA is specifically charged with weighing the risks\nagainst the probable benefits.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right. And in that way,\nthe State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the jury is doing the\nsame thing that the FDA did.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. And as this Court said in\nLohr and in Bates, when the State law mirrors the\nFederal law, there is no preemption.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was under\nthe expedited 510(k). That's different than PMA,\nbecause in PMA there's a specific weight.\nMS. ZIEVE: What the FDA does before the\nproduct reaches the market is different in the PMA\ncontext as opposed to 510(k). But when it comes to\ncomparing the State and Federal requirements -- I think\nis what you are getting at -- Lohr's analysis and the\nanalysis in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, Inc. didn't turn\non how rigorous the FDA requirements are, but are they\nparallel to the State requirements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the State\nrequirement there? I mean, what was the Federal\nrequirement there? It was simply that the device had\nbeen on the market before the law became effective.\nRight?\nMS. ZIEVE: The design requirement in Lohr?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMS. ZIEVE: It had to be substantially\nequivalent, safety and effectiveness, to a device that\nwas grandfathered in, that's right. But Medtronic\nargued in that case that it couldn't change the design\nof that product without filing another submission to the\nFDA, and that that was why there's preemption, and\nthat's the same argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the point is that\nthe -- to follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, the\npoint is that the FDA in Lohr had never made a\ndetermination of weighing the risks against the\nbenefits, as they do for the issuance of PMA's. And so\nthe jury was not replowing the same ground that the FDA\nhad already plowed in Lohr.\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't think that goes to\npreemption under 360k(a) which looks for a specific\nFederal requirement, a State device requirement, and\nthen looks at -- compares the two to see if there are\ncounterparts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how does it -- how\ndoes it compare with another process that the FDA looks\nat very closely, I think even more closely than new\ndevices -- new drugs. New drugs also go through a very\nlong testing period. Is there -- and the FDA gives its\napproval, and the drug is marketed, and it turns out it\nhas risks people didn't understand and there's a tort\nsuit. Is there -- is there a defense to the\nmanufacturer, \"I followed to the letter the permission\nthat the FDA gave me\"?\nMS. ZIEVE: Under the common law of most or\nall States, compliance with Federal law is a defense on\nthe merits, and it is not usually dispositive, but in\nsome States -- in some States it is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would certainly be\nat least the same here, right? That compliance with the\nFederal law would be a defense on the merits.\nMS. ZIEVE: Absolutely. I don't think that\nthe PMA is irrelevant to the tort suit. It's just not\nsufficient for preemption --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a reason -- as I\nunderstand it, tort suits are not preempted with respect\nto new drugs. Is there a reason to treat the two\ndifferently? For new medical devices and the new drugs?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, there is no express\npreemption provision in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\nwith respect to drugs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's the difference.\nSo the question -- what does the express preemption\nprovision mean?\nMS. ZIEVE: Right. But I think in trying to\nfigure out what the express preemption provision means,\nit's actually useful to consider why there's none for\ndrugs and there is one for devices. And the reason is\nbecause drugs were regulated by the FDA since 1938.\nDevices weren't regulated until 1976. So, in those\nintervening 38 years, States had stepped in and started\nto do some regulation on their own to fill that\nregulatory void.\nCalifornia is the most notable example, and\nthe one discussed the legislative history. So, when\ndrafting the medical device amendments and coming up\nwith the system for pre-market scrutiny, the question\narose, well, what about California? What about other\nStates that are regulating good manufacturing practices?\nOr California had a PMA scheme of its own. And so the\nlegislative history makes clear that Congress, faced\nwith this dilemma, decided California shouldn't be able\nto continue to regulate devices in that way. It\nshouldn't be able to pre-screen devices once the FDA had\nstepped in and filled the Federal void.\nAnd that's why you didn't need an express\npreemption provision for drugs. The States weren't\ndoing that in 1938, but because the government -- the\nFederal government waited so long to regulate devices,\nit was necessary to say what are we going to do about\nthese State regulations?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that mean that, under\nthe Food and Drug regulation, the States can issue their\nown regulations that contradict the Federal approval?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, they couldn't issue\nregulations that contradict the Federal approvals\nbecause of the express preemption provision. But\nwithout it, California --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. I'm talking about\ndrugs. Not medical devices. You say that --\nMS. ZIEVE: That would be a conflict\npreemption question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. I mean, you can\ncomply with both. It's just additional -- you have to\ngo further to comply with the State rule, so there's no\nconflict. It's easy to --\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, if there's no conflicts,\nthen there would be no preemption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then the States can issue\nregulations that go beyond -- beyond what the FDA says\nin drug matters? I would be surprised if that's the\ncase.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, if there's -- the only\nbasis for preemption with respect to drugs is conflict\npreemption. So, if your question incorporates if\nthere's no conflict, then there would no preemption.\nBut --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is that the only basis\nhere? Conflict -- there's no conflict? It's all okay\nunder the Medical Devices Act?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, here, if there is not a\nspecific Federal requirement that is the counterpart to\na State requirement, there is no preemption. That's\nwhat -- that's the language that Congress wrote and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They can add additional\nrequirements so long as -- and I suppose they can do\nthis by regulation -- so long as these additional\nrequirement dos not prevent complying with the Federal\nrequirements? So long as there's no conflict, the\nStates can add additional requirements under the Medical\nDevices Act? That's not my understanding of it.\nMS. ZIEVE: No. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is field preemption,\nisn't it?\nMS. ZIEVE: No, I don't think so. The --\nwhen the FDA has spoken directly to a question, then the\nState cannot impose requirements that are different from\nor in addition to what the FDA has said.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Take a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Take a concrete situation\nwhere the FDA is asked: We'd like to make this\nimprovement. And the FDA says no, we don't think that\nenhances safety. And then there's a tort suit based on\nthe failure to make that improvement. Wouldn't the FDA\nrejection of permission to make that improvement --\nwouldn't that at least be preemptive?\nMS. ZIEVE: If the -- if 360k(a) ever\npreempts tort claims, I think that would be a situation,\nbut if -- only the tort claim is -- is specific in that\nway, that you -- that the company failed in its duty of\ncare because it didn't design the device in the specific\nway that the FDA had rejected.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not the way I\nwould -- the jury has to say that?\nI mean, in fact --\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, that's what's\ngoing on, but it could have been safe if -- if they had\nmade the change that the FDA rejected. But the case\ngoes to the jury and that's, in fact, what's going on.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The trial is, you know, had\nhe -- had he made this change, it would have been safe,\nbut he didn't make the change and, therefore, you,\nladies and gentlemen of the jury, should hold the\ncompany liable.\nMS. ZIEVE: But if that's the theory of the\ncase, I think that's basically the one-inch/two-inch\nhearing aid fix of Justice Breyer's example in Lohr.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it just --\nMS. ZIEVE: But most tort claims --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just has to be the\ntheory of the case. We have to look at each jury\nverdict and decide whether that was the basis on which\nthe jury made the decision.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, it's -- it's not actually\nthat hard, because most tort claims are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your response\nwas it wouldn't go to the jury if the FDA had said no,\nyou cannot make this, and the plaintiff's point is you\nmust make it in order to make this device safe.\nI thought your answer to me was that the FDA\nregulation -- the FDA's action in refusing to allow the\nchange to be made would be preemptive and you wouldn't\ngive it to a jury to second-guess that determination by\nthe FDA.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. That's right. And I\nthought, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's under State law, but\nyou -- you don't say that Federal preemption requires\nthat; you say that by the grace of New York State, that\nmay be the situation, but New York State can change that\nlaw, as far as you're concerned, right?\nMS. ZIEVE: Can -- I'm sorry. Can change\nwhich law?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: New York State can let it\ngo to the jury, despite -- despite what the FDA has\ndone. You've said that it's simply a defense under New\nYork State law and the law of most States. But it\ndoesn't have to be a defense under New York State law.\nMS. ZIEVE: I think that's a different\npoint. Generally --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's the point\nJustice Ginsburg was implying.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I was asking you, if it\nwas -- as a matter of Federal law, if the FDA says --\nrejects.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a proposed change, can\na State court say, well, we think the FDA was wrong in\nrejecting that, so we're going to let it go to the jury.\nI thought the question I was posing to you is, isn't\nFederal law preemptive in that situation, when the FDA\nsays you can't do it and the personal injury lawyer\nwants it to convince the jury that they had to do it?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. In a situation where the\nFDA has said you are required not to market this\nspecific device and the State -- the plaintiff is\nseeking to impose a common-law duty that you must market\nthat specific design, then you would have counterpart\nState and Federal regulations, but the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the --\nMS. ZIEVE: The relevance of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Another variation -- the\nFDA says you must include X in this device or we won't\ngive you the pre-market approval. And so the\nmanufacturer puts X in, and then there's a lawsuit that\nwants to charge that putting X in made the device\ndangerous.\nWould the FDA's insistence that X be put in\ntake X out of any State court's tort litigation? That\nis, wouldn't -- if the FDA says you must have it, a\nState court couldn't put to a jury whether you should\nhave eliminated it?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. I think that's Justice\nBreyer's two-inch hearing aid fix, when the Federal\ngovernment says you must and the State law duty says\nthat you cannot.\nBut the -- that's not how tort claims are\nlitigated as a general matter. First of all, PMA's\ndon't say you must have this design feature. There's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I thought\nthat was your -- your theory was a little more nuanced.\nIn other words, they don't require you to market a\nparticular catheter. And you -- what I understood you\nto be arguing is that there may be a better design and\nthat it was negligent for the manufacturer to market a\nparticular design, even though they're allowed to; they\ndon't have to.\nMS. ZIEVE: Exactly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They should have\nmade the change to make it safer, right?\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if that's --\nMS. ZIEVE: And if you look at --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if that's what\nhappens, what, as a -- what's going to happen for\npatients at a time when your theory comes up, the\nmanufacturer looks at it and says, well, maybe this is a\nbetter device; we don't want to risk these tort suits,\nso we're going to stop selling our old device that's\nbeen approved, but now we have got to get FDA approval\nof the new device and that might take forever or at\nleast a year, let's say. And what happens to patients\nin that year? They've got no device.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, first of all, if the\ndevice is reasonably safe and effective, then the\ncompany is just not going to stop marketing it because\nof tort suits. And we know that because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your theory is\nthat although this device has been approved, here's a\nbetter one. And it's negligent on the manufacturer's\npart to market a device, even though approved by the\nFDA, when there's a better one that would reduce the\nrisks.\nMS. ZIEVE: Right. But we know that\nmanufacturers don't respond by taking devices off the\nmarket, because PMA has coexisted with tort suits since\n1976. For instance, recently --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you want\nthem to do if you think it's negligent for them to\nmarket the approved product? Don't you want them to\ntake it off the market?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I -- they should make\ntheir devices as safe as they can be. And if a tort\nsuit points out that this device is not reasonably safe,\nthen the manufacturer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not that it is\nnot reasonably safe. It's that another design would be\nsafer. And you think that's a basis for negligence\nbecause you say, yeah, the FDA approved it, but that\ndoesn't mean they required the manufacturer to market\nthat device.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right. And 360k looks to\nrequirements. It's not a matter of policy what the\neffect of tort suits is. The question is what are the\nrequirements imposed by the PMA, what requirements are\nimposed by State law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, this is all a\nlittle unrealistic. It is not as though some expert\nagency of the State has conducted a very scientific\ninquiry and decided that there's something safer than\nwhat the FDA approved or that it's negligent to issue\nwhat the FDA approved.\nWhat's going on is simply one jury has\ndecided that in its judgment, there was a safer device\nthat should have been used; and because of the judgment\nof that one jury, the manufacturer is placed at risk in\nselling a device that scientists at the FDA have said is\nokay.\nI find that extraordinary.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, any one of us might have\ndrawn the line differently. But the line Congress drew\nwas when there is a specific Federal requirement, we\nlooked for a device counterpart State requirement. And\nwhere they don't exist, there is no preemption.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought that was\nsomething a little different than that. The question\nthat I have which might be helpful to me, if you can\nanswer it, is -- that's being serious about it -- I'd be\nhelped by knowing what the specific design defect is\nthat you claim? That is, in what respect was this\ncatheter -- and I'd like you to refer to the details of\nthe catheter -- in what respect, what material or what\nshape or what -- what it is about this catheter that you\nas the plaintiff think was designed defectively, if you\ncan tell me?\nMS. ZIEVE: There's not a lot of discovery\nabout the design of the catheter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. But you must have\na theory.\nMS. ZIEVE: The general theory is that the\ndesign was unreasonably safe because the catheter should\nnot have -- should have been strong enough --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it about the design\nthat you are saying is not safe? That is, you can't go\ninto the court without having in your mind, as the\ncounsel, that some kind of specific thing that was wrong\nwith this catheter, other than just using the words\n\"design.\" I mean, how was it designed badly? What part\nof the design is not right?\nMS. ZIEVE: The strength of the balloon and\nthe way in which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are saying the material\nof the balloon should have been of a different material\nor a different thickness; is that right?\nMS. ZIEVE: Or designed to burst in a\ndifferent way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does that mean? How\ndo you design something to burst?\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't know how you design a\nballoon. But there --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you don't know how to\ndesign the balloon, what are you basing the design claim\non?\nMS. ZIEVE: As I said, the design claim in\nthis case was not significantly developed. Perhaps it\nwould help to talk about the design claim in Horn v.\nThoratec, for example, which is another PMA --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the label --\nthat you're pressing? So you said you really don't know\nwhat the design defect was. How about the label? That\nwould be the other thing.\nMS. ZIEVE: The labeling claim is that the\nlabel was -- inadequately warned or was misleading\nbecause although at one place it lists among 12\nprecautions not to inflate the balloon above the rate of\nburst pressure, which was eight, at another place it\nsays to -- it has a chart that shows inflation up to 13\natmosphere, and at another place in the instructions, it\nsays inflate to the nominal pressure, which is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's just like\na car speedometer. I mean, the speedometer goes up to\n120 miles an hour, but that doesn't mean you are\nsupposed to drive it that fast.\nMS. ZIEVE: But the car doesn't come with a\nchart that shows you safe usage of up to 100 miles\neither. And the instructions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was Medtronic free to\nalter this label without the FDA's consent?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. Under 814.39, Medtronic\ncould make changes to strengthen the warnings or clarify\nthe instructions without prior approval. And there's\none other part of the label that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the citation for\nthat?\nMS. ZIEVE: 21 CFR 814.39(d).\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me tell you why I asked\nmy question, because I don't want to leave -- you to\nleave with an unfavorable impression in my mind on your\nissue without your having a chance to see.\nWhat's worrying me is that, of course, it's\na terrible thing when somebody is hurt in these kinds of\naccidents. And the lawyers are trying to help. So the\nlawyers will think, look, there's a problem here. There\nmust be. My client was seriously hurt. And he's not\nsupposed to be.\nAnd then they'll work backward from that and\nsay well if he was hurt, there must be something wrong\nwith the design.\nSo every time there is an accident or\nsomething bad happens, the lawyers assert a design claim\nand they gear up discovery.\nAnd in my mind, could Congress have intended\nthat kind of thing when what they're trying to do is\nhave a group of experts really look into this and decide\nwhether it should marketed or not. That's what's\nbothering me. And that's why I would like you to\nrespond to that.\nMS. ZIEVE: Of course, it -- I freely admit\nthat at trial if the plaintiff couldn't articulate the\ndesign theory any better than I did here, the plaintiff\nis not going to lose on the design claim. But there are\nother cases where there is quite a clear theory about\nwhat the design defect is.\nThere are cases where the products have been\nrecalled because of a design defect; and in those cases,\ncould Congress have really intended to protect the\nmanufacturer from liability? After all, the Dalkon\nShield disaster where tons of people were hurt\nbecause -- women were killed and injured because of a\ndesign defect, was just infamous for the bill.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think that the key central focus of this\ncase was touched upon by Justice Kennedy's question.\nCongress made a decision that it wanted to balance\nreasonable safety and effectiveness of lifesaving\ndevices with the availability of lifesaving devices to\nthe public.\nThey did so by vesting this responsibility\nin the experts, the expertise, the judgment, and the\nprocesses at the FDA.\nAnd preemption of potentially conflicting,\nconfusing, and burdensome State law requirements is\nessential to this scheme.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why, Mr. Olson, is it\nmore essential to this scheme than the new drugs? I\nwould think that if everything that you said about new\ndevices would apply in bold letters to new drugs,\nbecause the testing procedures are much longer, are they\nnot?\nMR. OLSON: They're similar, but they're\nalso quite different, Justice Ginsburg. The principal\ndifference is this preemption provision that is the\nfundamental issue in this case. Section 360k(a)(1),\nthat similar provision was not put by Congress in the\nnew drug --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there's an argument\nthat what it was intended to do was to cut out State\npre-market approval, where States like California came\nin when there was a Federal void and said we shouldn't\nlet the manufacturers put out whatever they'd like.\nLet's have a pre-market approval.\nAnd the argument is, as you well know, which\nwas presented in Senator Kennedy's brief, that's what we\nmeant to do with the preemption provision. Nothing\nmore.\nMR. OLSON: If there was such a State\npre-market approval process, it would be something like\nthe Federal process which would involve a very detailed\napplication which would have everything about the\ndesign, the manufacture, and the warning labels in it.\nThen California would come up with different\nrequirements, presumably or potentially, than what the\nFDA had decided was a reasonable balance between safety\nand effectiveness and availability. And so therefore,\nthere would be different requirements.\nAnd, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his\nconcurring and dissenting opinion in the Lohr case, if a\nState jury or a State court comes up with those\ndifferent requirements, it is the same problem:\nDifferent States, different requirements under different\ncircumstances.\nAnd it would be quite anomalous for Congress\nto have given more power to juries in individual ad hoc\ncases which don't do the weighing, Justice Kennedy --\nthey can't do the same amount of weighing because their\nfocus --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the FDA\nhasn't done it? How are newly discovered flaws dealt\nwith? I mean, say where you have this catheter, and the\nFDA didn't look at the possibility of allergic reactions\nto the balloon plastic, and all of a sudden it turns out\nto be a serious problem.\nHow can you say that that's preemptive?\nMR. OLSON: This is a continuous process.\nInformation must be given by the manufacturer. There is\na process by which doctors report consequences to the\nFDA. Citizens may report information. This is a\ncontinuous jurisdiction --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the manufacturer free\nto continue to sell the device after newly discovered\nrisks --\nMR. OLSON: Yes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- pending the FDA's\nacting on the same information?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy. And let\nme explain why I think that is important to this case.\nIf the -- that information is then in the\npossession of the FDA. The FDA can suggest to the\nmanufacturer -- it can require the recall. It can\nchange warnings. It can do all of those things. But\nwhat it is doing, because it's continuously involved in\nthe process --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It takes time for the FDA\nto act. Let's assume that we know it's going to take\nsix months for the FDA to do this. The manufacturer\nknows that there's a real problem. He can continue to\nsell in the face of the knowledge of the real problem?\nMR. OLSON: What I'm suggesting is that the\nFDA can act as promptly or as slowly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was asking you about the\nmanufacturer's duty pending the FDA's action.\nMR. OLSON: It's dependent upon the\nmanufacturer providing information to the one\ncentralized agency --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, suppose the\nmanufacturer did not provide information. Would the\npreemption nevertheless exist?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Stevens, because in\nthat case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At least as a theoretical\npossibility, there could be a newly discovered risk that\nthe FDA never knew about. And, nevertheless, the claim\nwould be preemptive.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And that's a judgment that\nCongress made, because with the -- the manufacturer then\nwould be violating the law, failing to tell the FDA what\nwas going on, perhaps comitting fraud, and be subject to\ncriminal penalties, recall penalties, civil penalties,\nand that sort of thing.\nThe choice is, Justice Stevens, in that\nsituation -- is to allow the agency that has the\nexpertise, that has spent 1200 hours or so on this\nparticular device, according to your opinion in the Lohr\ncase, to make a judgment with respect to whether this\nproduct should be on the market or not.\nBecause as I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, that still\nleaves the -- sort of the hiatus that Justice Kennedy's\nquestion was addressed to. And I -- I don't think I\nunderstand your answer to it.\nHis question was what if the manufacturer\nhas learned that there is -- that there's a problem that\nsomebody hadn't anticipated? The manufacturer has told\nthe FDA, and the FDA has not yet acted.\nLeave open the question of whether the FDA\nis slow or whether it just takes time, but there's a --\nthere's a hiatus here. And an injury occurs because of\nmarketing that took place during the hiatus.\nDoes preemption still apply?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it does.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. OLSON: And the reason for that, Justice\nSouter, is that someone must make a judgment. That --\nthe information that the manufacturer may have learned\nmay be -- have some aspect of the safety or\neffectiveness of the device, but it still might be the\nbest product available.\nAs the government points out in its brief,\nthere are some devices that are used in situations where\na child might die. There's a 50-percent mortality rate\neven with using the device. So there's got to be\nindividual judgments with respect to variations of risk\nand safety and availability.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you know whether the PMA\nprocess in this case considered the design defects that\nthe Petitioner seems to be relying on?\nMR. OLSON: Well, all -- no, I don't know\nthe answer to that specifically, Justice Alito. But I\ndo know -- and this is the application, itself, which is\nnot, unfortunately, in the record, but is available\nthrough the FDA. It goes into elaborate detail with\nrespect to the burst pressures. This device -- the\nlabel on this device -- and that is in the record at\nA-174 of the court of appeals appendix -- specifically\nsays it shouldn't be inflated higher than a burst\npressure or atmospheric risk pressure at 8 atmospheres.\nThis one was inflated to 10 atmospheres, notwithstanding\nthe label requirements.\nSo what -- what I am saying is that the\nelaborate nature -- everything in the label has to be\napproved by the FDA. The safety indications, the\nprecautions, the hazards, the counter --\ncounterindications, and that sort of thing, there's a\nprofessional judgment there.\nMy colleague says that well, it's not the\nFDA's not imposing requirements, because this is a\ndesign submitted by the manufacturer. Of course, it's a\ndesign submitted by the manufacturer. That's how\ndevices are made.\nBut the FDA examines every little part of\nthat design -- the way it's manufactured, the way it's\nlabeled, the way it's marketed, the way it's going to be\nused.\nAnd it can say no, change that part of it,\nor have you considered this? It's a dialogue between\nthe manufacturer and the FDA.\nAnd then when the FDA is satisfied that it's\nreasonably safe and effective -- and the word\n\"reasonable\" is important. Nothing is perfectly safe.\nYou can make a car weigh a hundred tons, and it might be\nperfectly safe, but balances have to be made, the same\nwith drug devices. So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you look at the file of a\nPMA proceeding after it is concluded, can you tell\nexactly which design features and which risks the FDA\nhas considered?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't think you can. What\nyou can do, Justice Alito, is examine -- and Justice\nBreyer's example of the two-inch versus one-inch wire in\nthe Lohr case is a good example.\nThe FDA will have examined, and presumably\ndone its job, with respect to every aspect of the\ndesign, manufacture, and labeling and marketing of the\ndevice.\nNow, the choice is between that -- and I\nthink Congress made this judgment quite consciously,\nbecause if a -- if a jury comes along in a particular\ncase, examining a particular infant or a particular ill\nperson and the facts of a particular situation, and says\nwell, the device should have had a one-inch nail -- a\nwire, or it should have had a different tensile strength\nof the balloon, or something like that, then the\nmanufacturer is in this dilemma.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't there -- to --\nto take care of that kind of hypothetical where the FDA\nsays this isn't it, to say that kind of suit can't be\nbrought. But it is, indeed, mentioned that there's a\ncategory of suits that is simply saying: Manufacturer,\nyou didn't do what's in that pre-marketing approval?\nSo we're kind of a backup to not doing\nanything in conflict with the FDA's approval. We're\nsimply saying you didn't follow the labeling\nrequirement, or you didn't follow the design submission\nthat you --\nMR. OLSON: I think if there's a violation\nof the requirements -- now, it's no -- there's no\nquestion that there are requirements, because every\naspect of this approval incorporates the design and all\nof those things.\nIf the manufacturer fails to comply with\nthose requirements, that's a parallel suit that may be\nbrought.\nNow, in this case, the negligent\nmanufacturer -- a claim was made. It was dismissed on\nsummary judgment, which was affirmed by the Second\nCircuit because there was no evidence to support it. So\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you agree\nthat that was not preemptive.\nMR. OLSON: That was -- we agree that was\nnot preempted, and -- and the court of appeals came to\nthat same conclusion, but affirmed the district court\nthat dismissed it on summary judgment because there was\nno evidence to support it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would say the same\nthing for -- for design and labeling if the manufacturer\ndid not do what the FDA approved?\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nNow our -- the statute, I think, could not\nbe more clear with respect to every aspect of what the\nCourt talked about in the Lohr case. And I think that\nthe analysis that this Court articulated in the Geier\ncase having to do with the air bags, although that was\nan implied preemption and conflict preemption case and\nthis is an express preemption case, is very\nillustrative.\nThe Court went through an analysis of what\nmanufacturers might do if they were required to put an\nair bag in the car when the Department of Transportation\nhad decided that it wanted a little bit of play in the\nmarketplace with respect to different types of\nrestraints of individuals.\nAnd the Court made it very clear that if a\ntrial court in Kansas or some other place decides that\ncars must be manufactured in a certain way, that's what\nwould happen.\nAnd then the judgment of the Department of\nTransportation, which was considering all of these\nthings and wanting to encourage innovation with respect\nto restraints -- the same thing is true here.\nWe want in this country for devices to be as\nsafe and effective as they possibly can be. But we\ndon't want to discourage the marketing of products that\nmight save our lives. And these are -- Class 3 devices\nare all in the category of life-threatening or\nlife-saving devices here. So we want those available.\nThey may not all be perfect. They may work in some\nsituations and not work in other situations, but some\nexpert, centralized, that can take into consideration\nall of those factors should be the place where that\ndecision is made.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, what about the\nargument that once you've got this very valuable\npre-market approval, even though you could make that\ndevice safer, you have no incentive to do that. You\nhave permission to market this product as is. Even if\nyou know that there's a better way to do it, there's a\ndisincentive to try to go through the process and make\nthe change. Why should you, when you have carte blanche\nto continue without making the change?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think the real world\nanswers that question. The manufacturers of these\nproducts are always trying to produce better products\nthat will be safer. They of course have to go through\nthe process to justify to the experts at the FDA that\nthey are indeed safe, or -- and the FDA then may make a\njudgment that the reasonableness -- if there is a much\nsafer device that doesn't have the risks of the previous\ndevice, they can -- they can withdraw the approval of\nthe previous device.\nBut the FDA may at the same time say well,\nthis one device might be safer under some circumstances\nbut less safe under other circumstances. It might work\nin this critically ill patient, but not in this\ncritically ill patient. So the marketplace of doctors\nand patients deserves to have more than one product out\nthere, even though someone might decide this one is\nsafer than the other one. That is the way Congress made\nthis judgment. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the manufacturer finds\njust from its own laboratory experiments and not because\nof any data it's received from doctors and patients that\nthere's a better way to do this, does it have the\nobligation to notify the FDA?\nMR. OLSON: I don't think so,\nJustice Kennedy. I think that there may be marketplace\nincentives and other things that would cause a --\nsomeone in the marketplace to say I found a better way.\nSomeone in the marketplace might say well, it might be\nbetter, but it might be prohibitively expensive. There\nare all kinds of those judgments, and I think that\nillustrates the point.\nThe FDA is the right place for these\ndecisions to be made and this balancing process to\noccur, because an individual ad hoc -- not\nscientifically trained jury that is not required to\nconsider the consequences for the marketplace as a\nwhole, cannot make those judgments.\nAs conscientious as a jury might be, that\njudgment is in for that case and for that patient and\nmight say well gee, it should have been done differently\nin this particular situation; a one-inch wire might have\nbeen better in this particular case. But the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, I'm\nlooking at the Government's brief on page 4 which says\nthat in the annual reports, the -- the manufacturer has\nto disclose unpublished reports of data from clinical\ninvestigations or nonclinical laboratory studies\ninvolving the device.\nSo presumably that includes any nonclinical\nlaboratory studies that the manufacturer itself\nconducted.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. I believe that's true, but\nI think that was a slightly different point than\nJustice Kennedy's one; what was -- if it is the same\npoint, I agree with you, that there is an elaborate\nprocess of information exchange from the manufacturer\nand from doctors and from all over with respect to these\nmedical devices. It's described in considerable detail\nin about six pages in the court of appeals decision, and\nthe Government's brief describes it quite thoroughly as\nwell.\nThat same balancing, the Government filed a\nbrief last week in this Court in the Warner Lambert\ncase, that this Court will be hearing, I think in\nJanuary, which describes in even greater detail than it\ndoes in the brief filed here about that balancing\nprocess and the importance of the centralized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you answer one thing\nfor me on that? Is that a -- as soon as they get the\ninformation requirement, or is it an annual requirement\nthat they have to take --\nMR. OLSON: That -- what the Chief Justice\nwas referring to was an annual requirement --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. OLSON: -- but there also are\nrequirements -- and I haven't -- can't give you the\nexact citation, there's a lot of subparagraphs in these\nsections -- with respect to information that comes into\nthe possession of the manufacturer that's pertinent to\nadverse consequences or effects of the device that must\nbe given promptly to the FDA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, the other side\nsays well, you know, these are all horribles but, in\nfact, we have had tort suits and manufacturers haven't\ntaken their products off the market. This is all just a\nChicken Little kind of a --\nMR. OLSON: Well, I don't agree with that,\nJustice Scalia. In the first place, I don't think we\nknow. Secondly, there are six of the seven circuits\nthat have considered this case, found that those tort\nsuits were preempted. So to the degree to which they\nare out there, there is one circuit in which they might\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But of course the FDA took\nthis contrary position some years ago.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it did, and it -- and it\nlearned from experience -- the unique experience that\nyou described the FDA having, in your opinion in the\nLohr case, has been brought to bear in this case; and\nthere's a reasoned explanation for the FDA's -- the\nGovernment's position today, as to why it took one\nposition then -- there were some proposed regulations\nthat are no longer on the table -- but there's a\nreasoned explanation by the agency that you said and\nquite correctly in my judgment had a unique experience,\nand unique capability of determining the effect of\ntake -- State court suits on the process that it's\ninvolved in, and that's reflected in the Government's\nbriefs that are filed in this case just earlier.\nThe fact is that there are specific detailed\nrequirements with respect to every aspect of the device\nthat's approved by the FDA; and any jury, just like any\nregulatory body, Justice Breyer, will impose a different\nrequirement. The fundamental that you asked about,\nwhat's the basis of this suit, there was some answer to\nit, but the fact is there's some effort to explain why,\nif it was designed according to the approval, by the\nFDA, that wasn't good enough.\nThere was something wrong with that design\nthat was approved. Something wrong with that label that\nwas approved. And a jury at the end of the day will be\nexpected then to render a different requirement by\nsaying you are liable for damages because you did it the\nway the FDA approved.\nThat is a State requirement which is a\ncounterpart to the Federal requirement, and this -- and\nCongress made it explicitly clear that any requirement\nthat is different or in addition to the Federal\nrequirement is preempted if it has to do with safety or\neffectiveness of the device.\nAnd if juries require products to be\nchanged, they will by definition be either less safe or\nless available than the FDA has determined is in the\nbest interests of the public according to the\nresponsibility vested in them by Congress.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think it might be useful to begin by\nfocusing on the consequences of Petitioner's argument\nthat the PMA approval of an application does not result\nin requirements that are preemptive for purposes of the\npreemptive provision. Under Petitioner's view, the day\nafter the FDA gave PMA approval to a particular device,\nState legislatures or State regulatory agencies could\nadopt laws or regulations that would direct the\nmanufacturer to manufacture or design the product or to\ngive labeling that would conflict with what the FDA had\njust approved. And we don't think that Congress could\nhave intended in enacting the express preemption\nprovision here to allow State regulatory agencies or,\neven more so, individual juries that could very within a\nState --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you\nconceded that there would be conflict preemption, that\nthe States could not -- either through a State agency or\nthrough a jury -- come up with a requirement that would\nconflict with an FDA requirement.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But we think that the express\npreemption provision embodies that very important\nconflict, or maybe in this context it is best to\nconceptualize it as field preemption, of the things that\nare included within the application that is submitted to\nthe FDA and the labeling.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Additional requirements are\nnot necessarily conflicting requirements. You\ncan comply with --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that is -- that is\ndefinitely true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is clear that Congress\ndidn't want additional requirements.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's entirely\ncorrect, and if I could just elaborate on that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How are they not\nconflicting? Go ahead; go ahead -- elaborate.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, what I was going to say\n-- to elaborate on the point that I made, Petitioner\nconcedes that if there is an FDA PMA requirement, the\nState may not impose its own PMA requirement; and that\nhas to be correct, because in the State PMA approval,\nthe State could withhold its approval unless the\nmanufacturer changed the device or changed the labeling\nin some way to get it cleared through --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Everybody agrees that\nfar, that the States were not to be in the business of\nissuing PMA's. The question is does the preemption\nclause mean any more than that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it's important to\nunderstand why. Congress was not concerned about the\nPMA in the abstract or as a process; it was concerned\nabout what the consequences of requiring the\nmanufacturer to go through the PMA process were. And\nthat was precisely because the result of the State PMA\nprocess could be to impose different requirements. The\nlabeling should read differently --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the product should be\ndifferently.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you compared drugs,\nwhich -- I think you will -- you will concede -- go\nthrough a very arduous process, new drugs, why -- maybe\nyou think that the same preemption applies there,\nalthough there's no preemption clause.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There is -- there is no\nexpress preemption clause there. One -- one possible\nexplanation might be is that a -- that a device is a\ntangible concrete item, an item of commerce that is --\nthat has extensive design and planning and blueprints in\na way that a drug doesn't quite have that same -- that\nsame characteristic. I mean, like other -- like\nautomobiles or something, that they have a tangible\naspect and a long lead time in the design and\nmanufacture.\nThat may be one explanation for why Congress\nwanted to be especially firm about imposing preemption\nwith respect to Federally approved devices.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was also a different\nCongress.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It was a different Congress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How much -- how many years\nlater?\nMR. KNEEDLER: This was 1976 when we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did we expect them to\ncome out with the same --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and they were only\naddressing devices in that -- these were not general FDA\namendments; they were addressing -- they were addressing\nthe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anyone -- when this\npreemption clause was put in the new Medical Device, did\nthe government -- when was the government change? Was\nit 2004? The government's position, the FDA's position,\nwas 180 degrees different --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the government filed a\nbrief in -- in late 1997 taking a position that PMA\napproval did not -- did not have preemptive effect.\nThat was issued together with FDA's issuance of a\nproposed rule to the same effect. FDA withdrew that\nproposed rule 7 months later. The government did not\naddress this question again until 2004 in the brief\nyou're referring to in the court of appeals.\nAnd due in large part to examining the very\nthings that I've been talking about, that in FDA's\njudgment, which this Court in the Lohr case said was\nentitled to considerable deference, FDA recognized that\nthere would be a serious undermining of FDA's approval\nauthority and its balancing of the risks and benefits,\nif a State jury could reweigh those -- the balance that\nFDA had struck in the new Medical Device --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose a label is\napproved in a very specific form under PMA, and then a\nyear later, it turns out, unforeseen by anyone, that\ndoctors are just -- many good doctors are just reading\nit the wrong way and it's dangerous.\nCan the manufacturer continue to sell new\ndevices with the same label pending the annual report?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I mean, let me just\nclarify.\nIf the -- if the -- there are incident\nreports that -- that a manufacturer is supposed to give\nto FDA. There is often a difficult judgment as to\nwhether the injury that is associated with a device is\nsome problem of the device or whether it's some problem\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just take --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- with what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just take my hypothetical.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And it -- what I was going to\nsay is it's possible that the labeling would be regarded\nas misleading for some reason. In that event, the\nmanufacturer should apply to -- should submit what's\ncalled a supplemental PMA and request that the labeling\nbe changed to clarify that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you could -- and the\nmanufacturer continued to sell the device knowing that\nthe label is being misconstrued by very good doctors\npending FDA action?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Ordinarily, yes. If there\nwas -- if there was a very serious risk to health and\nsafety --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it's very serious.\nMR. KNEEDLER: In that event, FDA has\nvariety of tools that it can take and so does the\nmanufacturer. One of them is what's sometimes called a\n\"Dear Doctor\" letter, which is notification -- this is\nprovided for under 360h(a) of the Act -- is a\nnotification to physicians or other users of a product\nthat there may be some previously unrecognized problem\nor misrepresentation or what could be misconstruction of\nthe label.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the failure to give\nthat notice subject the manufacturer to liability if the\nmanufacturer continues to sell the device?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would not subject it to\nState tort liability, no. If there was -- if there was\na situation where the manufacturer knew of a serious\nproblem and did not report it to it FDA, that could\nsubject the manufacturer to criminal penalties with\nrespect to FDA for either misrepresenting or withholding\ninformation. But that's really the Buckman -- this\nCourt's Buckman decision, that that's the relationship\nbetween FDA and the manufacturer, and that's the\nincentive.\nI think someone asked about what incentives\ndoes the manufacturer has. The manufacturer has a\npowerful incentive because of the criminal penalties and\nother sanctions that can be taken by FDA if -- if the\nmanufacturer does not report something to the FDA.\nPlus, manufacturers have an important reputational\ninterest, that they don't want to be seen to be flouting\npossible problems.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, let me ask\nyou to -- a textual question which perhaps would be\nbetter directed to counsel for the Petitioner, but let\nme get your take on it.\nIf the only objective in the -- in the\npreemption clause were to preclude State PMA in addition\nto Federal PMA, there would have been no reason to\ninclude the phrase -- would there have been any reason\nto include a preclusion of a requirement that is\ndifferent from in addition to a preclusion of something\nwhich is in addition to?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- if it was just -- I\nthink that's a good point. If it was just a question of\ngoing through a duplicative State PMA process --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Addition to\" would be --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. Right. Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And also I think the FDA\nregulations promulgated when this was put out, soon\nafter the '76 amendments were passed, I think reinforced\nthe conclusion that -- and, in fact, there was a\nregulation that specifically talks about the application\nof general adulteration standards in a way that might\nrequire a specific label change to be made by a\nmanufacturer, and we think that's basically precisely\nthis lawsuit. It's the application of general tort law\nthat would require the manufacturer or a standard of\ncare under common law that would say that what the\nmanufacturer had done specifically approved by FDA was\n-- was improper as a matter of State law. We think that\nthat is in the teeth of the preemption provision. I\nthink Justice Alito asked the question about the issue\nof whether FDA focused or didn't focus on a particular\naspect of the design. We don't think that a preemption\ntest can really realistically turn on that. That would\nrequire extensive and intrusive inquiry into what FDA\nhad done. We think that the best way to look at this is\nwhat the end product was; what was the application that\nwas finally approved and the labeling associated with\nit, much like the filed rate doctrine. You look at what\nwas put before the agency and what was approved, not\nwhat might have gone into -- into consideration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Zieve, you have\n4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. ZIEVE: First of all, it's not our\nposition, Justice Souter, that only State PMA's are\npreempted. California has good manufacturing practice\nrequirements that were preempted to the extent they were\ndifferent from or in addition to the Federal\nrequirement.\nSome States had hearing aid packaging\nrequirements. There was a State that had a requirement\nabout the grants of prescription glasses, lenses. So\nit's -- it is broader than just --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And how do you draw the\nline between those instances and the ones that you say\nare not preempted?\nMS. ZIEVE: Those were specific requirements\nfor devices, and they had counterparts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They -- they were\nrequirements, in other words, of positive law? They\nwere State regulations?\nMS. ZIEVE: Addressed specifically to\ndevices, and they had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the --\nMS. ZIEVE: -- direct Federal counterparts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So the line is\nsimply enactment of positive law versus jury award?\nThat's the line?\nMS. ZIEVE: I think that's what Congress was\nintending.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I just want to make\nsure --\nMS. ZIEVE: I think under --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what your position is.\nThat is where you draw the line then?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Didn't the Court --\ndidn't the majority of the Court reject that line in\nLohr?\nMS. ZIEVE: The holding of Lohr didn't\nreject it. Five justices disagreed with me, and I don't\nthink you need to agree with me on that point to find\nfor me here. We talked about some examples that Justice\nGinsburg offered, in which a State common-law duty could\nbecome so specific that it effectively imposed a State\ndevice requirement.\nI also want to correct the point that\nmanufacturers can't make labeling changes without FDA\napproval. Again, 814.39(d) allows them to do so. And\nso the catheter's label, where it says \"inflate the\nballoon gradually to higher pressure up to the rated\nburst pressure or until the stenosis resolves,\" the\nnarrowing resolves, to me that's ambiguous as to whether\nyou can go above the rated burst pressure. Medtronic\ncould have clarified that instruction without running\nafoul of any FDA regulation.\nAs for the FDA's current views, it is not\nactually correct that in Lohr the government gave weight\nto the FDA's amicus brief. The government gave weight\nto the FDA's regulation, 808.1(d). That regulation is\nstill in effect, and it hasn't been modified since --\nsince Lohr was issued.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do I read in order to\nverify your statement that the -- that manufacturers can\ncure the label without FDA approval? Where do I find\nthat?\nMS. ZIEVE: Without prior approval?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMS. ZIEVE: 814.39(d).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMS. ZIEVE: After FDA approved the PMA, any\nof the listed changes can be placed into effect prior to\nthe receipt of a written FDA order approving the PMA\nsupplement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could -- I'm\nsorry -- I've been thinking about your example of\nambiguity. You're saying it is ambiguous when they say\nyou can inflate it up to the bursting pressure or until\nthe blockage is cleared?\nMS. ZIEVE: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that\nobvious mean if the blockage is clear, you don't keep\ninflating it to the bursting pressure. You think that\ndoctors read that as saying you can inflate it past the\nbursting pressure unless -- if the blockage isn't\ncleared?\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. It says either one. It\ndoesn't say up to a maximum. There is testimony from\nthe doctor in this case that he thought that the label\nshowed testing up to 13. And that based on the\ndirections, he thought that going up to 10 was fine and\nthat it was standard use among the cardiologists.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the\nlabel said eight is the bursting pressure?\nMS. ZIEVE: The rate at burst pressure,\nyeah.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. ZIEVE: I also want to mention -- we\ndon't come to this case on a blank slate. We come to it\nin light of Lohr. The Court has already interpreted\nSection 360k(a). In finding no preemption in Lohr of\nany of the claims, the Court looked to the labeling\nregulation 801.109 was applicable to the device there.\nThat is the same exact regulation that is applicable to\nthe device here.\nIf Medtronic's PMA device complies with\n801.109, then it is deemed to be not misbranded, but\nthat is a moving target. What is adequate instructions\nfor use changes as the manufacturer learns about use of\nits product in the real world. The same process for\nmaking design changes exists in this case as existed in\nLohr.\nAnd on the State law side, we really are\ntalking about identical State duties of care, which this\nCourt said their generalities majority held that the\ngenerality of these duties left them outside the\ncategory of requirements that 360k envisioned to be with\nrespect to the device.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Zieve.\n"
