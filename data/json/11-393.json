        "content": "(10:19 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will continue\nargument this morning in Case Number 11-393, National\nFederation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, and Case\n11-400, Florida v. The Department of HHS.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf the individual mandate is\nunconstitutional, then the rest of the Act cannot stand.\nAs Congress found and the Federal Government concedes,\nthe community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions of\nthe Act cannot stand without the individual mandate.\nCongress found that the individual mandate was essential\nto their operation.\nAnd not only can guaranteed issue and\ncommunity rating not stand, not operate in the manner\nthat Congress intended, they would actually counteract\nCongress's basic goal of providing patient protection\nbut also affordable care.\nYou can -- if you do not have the individual\nmandate to force people into the market, then community\nrating and guaranteed issue will cause the cost of\npremiums to skyrocket. We can debate the order of\nmagnitude of that, but we can't debate that the\ndirection will be upward. We also can't debate --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that may well\nbe true. The economists are going back and forth on\nthat issue, and the figures vary from up 10 percent to\nup 30. We're not in the habit of doing the legislative\nfindings.\nWhat we do know is that for those States\nthat found prices increasing, that they found various\nsolutions to that. In one instance -- and we might or\nmay not say that it's unconstitutional -- Massachusetts\npassed the mandatory coverage provision. But others\nadjusted some of the other provisions.\nWhy shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in\nfact the economists prove -- some of the economists\nprove right that prices will spiral? What's wrong with\nleaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should\nbe fixing this, not us?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of questions --\na couple of responses, Justice Sotomayor. First of all,\nI think that it's very relevant here that Congress had\nbefore it as examples some of the States that had tried\nto impose guaranteed issue and community rating, and did\nnot impose an individual mandate. And Congress rejected\nthat model. So, your question is quite right in saying\nthat it's not impossible to have guaranteed issue and\ncommunity rating without an individual mandate. But\nit's a model that Congress looked at and specifically\nrejected.\nAnd then, of course, there's Congress's own\nfinding, and their finding, of course -- this is finding\n(i), which is 43a of the Government's brief, in the\nappendix. Congress specifically found that having the\nindividual mandate is essential to the operation of\nguaranteed issue and community rating.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's all it said it\nwas essential to. I mean, I'm looking at it. The\nexchanges. The State exchanges are information-\ngathering facilities that tell insurers what the various\npolicies actually mean. And that has proven to be a\ncost saver in many of the States who have tried it. So,\nwhy should we be striking down a cost saver --\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when, if what your\nargument is -- was that Congress was concerned about\ncosts rising?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should we assume\nthey wouldn't have passed an information --\nMR. CLEMENT: I think a couple of things.\nOne, you get -- I mean, I would think you'd sort of have\nto take the bitter with the sweet. And if Congress --\nif we're going to look at Congress's goal of providing\npatient protection but also affordable care, we can't --\nI don't think it works to just take the things that save\nmoney and cut out the things that are going to make\npremiums more expensive. But at a minimum --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think on the bottom\nline, is why don't we let Congress fix it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, let me answer the bottom\nline question, which is, no matter what you do in this\ncase, at some point there's going to be -- if you strike\ndown the mandate, there's going to be something for\nCongress to do. The question is really what task do you\nwant to give Congress? Do you want to give Congress the\ntask of fixing the statute after something has been\ntaken out, especially a provision at the heart, or do\nyou want to give Congress the task of fixing health\ncare? And I think it would be better in this\nsituation --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're not taking -- if\nwe strike down one provision, we're not taking that\npower away from Congress. Congress could look at it\nwithout the mandatory coverage provision and say this\nmodel doesn't work; let's start from the beginning. Or\nit could choose to fix what it has. We're not declaring\n-- one portion doesn't force Congress into any path.\nMR. CLEMENT: And, of course, that's right,\nJustice Sotomayor, and no matter what you do here,\nCongress will have the options available. So, if you --\nif you strike down only the individual mandate, Congress\ncould say the next day, well, that's the last thing we\never wanted to do so we are going to strike down the\nrest of the statute immediately and then try to fix the\nproblem. So, whatever you do, Congress is going to have\noptions. The question is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's such a thing as\nlegislative inertia, isn't there?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, that's exactly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- what I was going to say,\nJustice Scalia, which is I think the question for this\nCourt is -- we all recognize there's legislative\ninertia. And then the question is what's the best\nresult in light of that reality?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not suggesting\nthat we should take on more power to the Court?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because Congress would\nchoose to take one path rather than another. That's\nsort of taking onto the Court more power than one, I\nthink, would want.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I agree. We're simply\nasking this Court to take on, straight on, the idea of\nthe basic remedial inquiry into severability which looks\nto the intent of the Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I wanted to ask you\nabout that. Why do we look to the -- are you sure we\nlook to the intent of the Congress? I thought that, you\nknow, sometimes Congress says that these provisions will\n-- all the provisions of this Act will be severable, and\nwe ignore that when the Act really won't work, when the\nremaining provisions just won't work. Now, how can you\nsquare that reality with the proposition that what we're\nlooking for here is what would this Congress have\nwanted?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, two responses,\nJustice Scalia: We can look at this Court's cases on\nseverability, and they all formulate the test a little\nbit differently.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, they sure do.\nMR. CLEMENT: But every one of them talks\nabout congressional intent. But here's the -- there's\nthe other answer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, but is it\nright?\nMR. CLEMENT: It is right. And here's how I\nwould answer your question, which is, when Congress\nincludes a severability clause, it's addressing the\nissue in the abstract. It doesn't say, no matter which\nprovisions you strike down, we absolutely, positively\nwant what's left.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. The consequence\nof your proposition, would Congress have enacted it\nwithout this provision, okay, that's the consequence.\nThat would mean that if we struck down nothing in this\nlegislation but the -- what is it called -- the \"Corn\nHusker kickback,\" okay, we find that to violate the\nconstitutional proscription of venality, okay?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When we strike that down,\nit's clear that Congress would not have passed it\nwithout that. It was -- it was the means of getting the\nlast necessary vote in the Senate. And you're telling\nus that the whole statute would fall because the\nCornhusker kickback is bad. That can't be right.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nit can be, which is to say that the basic proposition,\nthat it's congressional intent that governs. Now,\neverybody on this Court has a slightly different way of\ndivining legislative intent. And I would suggest the\none common ground among every member of this Court, as I\nunderstand it, is you start with the text. Everybody\ncan agree with that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Clement, let's start\nwith the text. And you suggest, and I think that there\nis -- this is right, that there is a textual basis for\nsaying that the guarantee-issue and the community-rating\nprovisions are tied to the mandate. And you -- you\npointed to where that was in the findings.\nIs there a textual basis for anything else?\nBecause I've been unable to find one. It seems to me\nthat if you look at the text, the sharp dividing line is\nbetween guarantee issue, community ratings, on the one\nhand; everything else, on the other.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I'd be\ndelighted to take you through my view of the text and\nwhy there are other things that have to fall.\nThe first place I'd ask you to look is\nFinding (J), which is on the same page, 43a. And as I\nread that, that's a finding that the individual mandate\nis essential to the operation of the exchanges.\nBut there are other links between guaranteed\nissue and community rating and the exchanges. And\nthere, I think, it's just the way that the exchanges are\nsupposed to work, and the text makes this clear, is\nthey're supposed to provide a market where people can\ncompare community-rated insurance. That's what makes\nthe exchanges function.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Although the exchanges\nfunction perfectly well in Utah, where there is no\nmandate. They function differently, but they function.\nAnd the question is always, does Congress want half a\nloaf? Is half a loaf better than no loaf? And on\nsomething like the exchanges, it seems to me a perfect\nexample where half a loaf is better than no loaf. The\nexchanges will do something. They won't do everything\nthat Congress envisioned.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I think\nthere are situations where half a loaf is actually\nworse, and I want to address that. But before I -- more\nbroadly -- but before I do that, if I can stick with\njust the exchanges.\nI do think the question that this Court is\nsupposed to ask is not just whether they can limp along\nand they can operate independently, but whether they\noperate in the manner that Congress intended. And\nthat's where I think the exchanges really fall down,\nbecause the vision of the exchanges was that if you got\nout of this current situation where health insurance is\nbasically individualized priced based on individualized\nunderwriting and you provide community rating, then it's\ngoing to be very easy for people to see, okay, well,\nthis is a silver policy, and this is a bronze policy,\nand this is a gold policy. And we can -- you know, I\ncan just pick which insurer provides what I think is\ngoing to be the best service based on those comparable\nprovisions.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, you just said\nsomething which you say a lot in your brief. You say\nthe question is the manner in which it would have\noperated. And I think that that's not consistent with\nour cases. And I guess the best example would be\nBooker, where we decided not to sever provisions,\nnotwithstanding that the sentencing guidelines clearly\noperate in a different manner now than they did when\nCongress passed them. They operate as advisory rather\nthan mandatory.\nMR. CLEMENT: But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I\nactually think Booker supports our point as well,\nbecause there are two aspects of the remedial holding of\nBooker. And the first part of it, which I think\nactually very much supports our point is where the\nmajority rejects the approach of the dissent, which\nactually would have required nothing in the statute to\nhave been struck, not a single word.\nBut, nonetheless, this Court said, boy, if\nyou do that, then all of the sentencing is basically\ngoing to be done by a combination of the juries and the\nprosecutors, and the judges are going to be cut out.\nAnd the Court said the one thing we know is that's not\nthe manner in which Congress thought that this should\noperate.\nNow, later they make a different judgment\nabout the -- which particular provisions to cut out.\nBut I do think Booker is consistent with this way of\nlooking at it. It's certainly consistent with Brock,\nthe opinion that we rely on, because there the Court\nonly reached that part of the opinion after they had\nalready found that the must-hire provision operated\nfunctionally independent from the legislative veto.\nSo --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, there are so\nmany things in this Act that are unquestionably okay. I\nthink you would concede that reauthorizing -- what is it\n-- the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, changes to\nthe Black Lung benefits. Why make Congress redo those?\nI mean, it's a question of whether we say everything you\ndid is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes,\nthere are many things in here that have nothing to do,\nfrankly, with the affordable health care, and there are\nsome that we think it's better to let Congress to decide\nwhether it wants them in or out.\nSo, why should we say it's a choice between\na wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting,\nor a salvage job? And the more conservative approach\nwould be salvage rather than throwing out everything.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, two\nkinds of responses to that: One, I do think there are\nsome provisions that I would identify as being at the\nperiphery of this statute, and I'll admit that the case\nfor severing those is perhaps the strongest.\nBut I do think it's fundamentally different,\nbecause if we were in here arguing that some provision\non the periphery of the statute, like the Biosimilars\nAct or some of the provisions that you've mentioned, was\nunconstitutional, I think you'd strike it down and you\nwouldn't even think hard about severability.\nWhat makes this different is that the\nprovisions that have constitutional difficulties or are\ntied at the hip to those provisions that have the\nconstitutional difficulty are the very heart of this\nAct. And then if you look at how they are textually\ninterconnected with the exchanges, which are then\nconnected to the tax credits, which are also connected\nto the employer mandates, which is also connected to\nsome of the revenue offsets, which is also connected to\nMedicaid, if you follow that through what you end up\nwith at the end of that process is just sort of a hollow\nshell. And at that point, I think there is a strong\nargument for not -- I mean, we can't possibly think that\nCongress would have passed that hollow shell without the\nheart of the Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it would\nhave -- it would have passed parts of the hollow shell.\nI mean, a lot of this is reauthorization of\nappropriations that have been reauthorized for the\nprevious 5 or 10 years, and it was just more convenient\nfor Congress to throw it in, in the middle of the\n2700 pages than to do it separately. I mean, can you\nreally suggest -- I mean, they cite the Black Lung\nBenefits Act, and those have nothing to do with any of\nthe things we're talking about.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you\nknow, they tried to make them germane. But I'm not here\nto tell you that, you know -- some of their -- surely,\nthere are provisions that are just looking for the next\nlegislative vehicle that's going to make it across the\nfinish line, and somebody's going to attach it to\nanything that's moving. I mean, I'll admit that.\nBut the question is -- when everything else\nfrom the center of the Act is interconnected and has to\ngo, if you follow me that far, then the question is\nwould you keep this hollowed-out shell?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but it's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm still not sure,\nwhat is the test -- and this was a colloquy you had with\nJustice Scalia with the Cornhusker hypothetical. I need\nto know what standard you're asking me to apply. Is it\nwhether as a rational matter the separate parts could\nstill function, or does it focus on the intent of the\nCongress?\nIf you -- suppose you had party A wants\nproposal number 1; party B wants proposal number 2.\nCompletely unrelated. One is airline rates; the other\nis milk regulation. And we -- and they decide them\ntogether. The procedural rules are these have to be\nvoted on as one. They are both passed. Then one is\ndeclared unconstitutional. The other can operate\ncompletely independently. Now, we know that Congress\nwould not have intended to pass one without the other.\nIs that the end of it, or is there some different test?\nBecause we don't want to go into legislative history,\nthat's intrusive, so we ask whether or not an objective\n-- as an objective rational matter, one could function\nwithout -- I still don't know what the test is that\nwe're supposed to apply. And this is the same question\nas Justice Scalia asked. Could you give me some help on\nthat?\nMR. CLEMENT: Sure. Justice Kennedy, the\nreality is I think this Court's opinions have at various\ntimes applied both strains of the analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And which one -- and what\ntest do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify\nour jurisprudence?\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm -- I'm a big believer in\nobjective tests, Justice Kennedy. I'd be perfectly\nhappy with you to apply a more textually based objective\napproach. I think there are certain Justices that are\nmore inclined to take more of a peek at legislative\nhistory, and I think if you look at the legislative\nhistory of this, it would only fortify the conclusion\nthat you would reach from a very objective textual\ninquiry. But I am happy to focus the Court on the\nobjective textual inquiry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't\nunderstand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that objective test is\nwhat?\nMR. CLEMENT: It is whether the statute can\noperate in the manner that Congress -- that Congress\nintended. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No statute can do that,\nbecause once we chop off a piece of it, by definition,\nit's not the statute Congress passed. So, it has to be\nsomething more than that.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, every one\nof your cases, if you have a formulation for\nseverability, if you interpret it woodenly, it becomes\ntautological. And Justice Blackmun addressed this in\nfootnote 7 of the Brock opinion that we rely on, where\nhe says: Of course, it's not just -- you know, it\ndoesn't operate exactly in the manner because it doesn't\nhave all the pieces, but you still make an inquiry as to\nwhether -- I mean, when Congress links two provisions\ntogether and one really won't work without the other --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what is wrong with\nthe presumption that our law says, which is we presume\nthat Congress would want to sever? Wouldn't that be the\nsimplest, most objective test? Going past what\nJustice Scalia says we have done, okay, get rid of\nlegislative intent altogether, which some of our\ncolleagues in other contexts have promoted, and just\nsay: Unless Congress tells us directly it's not\nseverable, we shouldn't sever. We should let them fix\ntheir problems.\nYou still haven't asked -- answered me why\nin a democracy structured like ours, where each branch\ndoes different things, why we should involve the Court\nin making the legislative judgment?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, let me try\nto answer the specific question and then answer the big\npicture question. The specific question is -- I mean,\nyou could do that. You could adopt a new rule now that\nbasically says, look, we've sever --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not a new rule. We\npresume. We've rebutted the presumption in some\ncases --\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but some would call\nthat judicial action.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think in fairness, though,\nJustice Sotomayor, to get to the point you're wanting to\nget to, you'd have to ratchet up that presumption a\ncouple of ticks on the scale, but -- and because the one\nthing --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what's wrong with\nthat?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, one thing that's wrong\nwith that, which is still at a smaller level, is that's\ninconsistent with virtually every statement in every one\nof your severability opinions, which all talk about\ncongressional intent.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's not inconsistent\nwith our practice, right, Mr. Clement? I mean, you have\nto go back decades and decades and decades, and I'm not\nsure even then you could find a piece of legislation\nthat we refused to sever for this reason.\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think that's right,\nJustice Kagan. I mean, I think there are more recent\nexamples. A great example I think, which sort of proves\nand maybe is a segue to get to my broader point, is a\ncase that involves a State statute, not a Federal\nstatute, but I don't think anything turns on that, is\nRandall v. Sorrell, where this Court struck down various\nprovisions of the Vermont campaign finance law. But\nthere were other contribution provisions that were not\ntouched by the theory that the Court used to strike down\nthe contribution limits. But this Court at the end of\nthe opinion said, you know, there's no way to think that\nthe Vermont legislator would have wanted these handful\nof provisions there on the contribution side. So, we'll\nstrike down the whole thing.\nAnd if I could make the broader point, I\nmean, I think the reason it makes sense in a democracy\nwith separation of powers to in some cases sever the\nwhole thing is because sometimes a half a loaf is worse.\nAnd a great example, if I dare say so, is Buckley. In\nBuckley this Court looked at a statute that tried to, in\na coherent way, strike down limits on contributions and\nclosely related expenditures.\nThis Court struck down the ban on\nexpenditures, left the contribution ban in place, and\nfor four decades Congress has tried to fix what's left\nof the statute, largely unsuccessfully; whereas it would\nhave I think worked much better from a democratic and\nseparation of powers standpoint if the Court would have\nsaid: Look, expenditures are -- you can't limit\nexpenditures under the Constitution. The contribution\nprovision is joined at the hip. Give Congress a chance\nto actually fix the problem, not just --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you one question,\nwhich is a practical question? I take as a given your\nanswer to Justice Kennedy. You're saying let's look at\nit objectively and say would Congress have intended\nthis, okay? This is the mandate in the community --\nthis is Titles I and II, the mandate, the community,\npre-existing condition, okay? Here's the rest of it,\nyou know, and when I look through the rest of it, I have\nall kinds of stuff in there. And I haven't read every\nword of that, I promise. All right.\nI mean, as you pointed out, there's biosimilarity,\nthere's breast feeding, there's promoting nurses and\ndoctors to serve underserved areas, there's the CLASS\nAct, et cetera.\nWhat do you suggest we do? I mean, should\nwe appoint a special master with an instruction? Should\nwe go back to the district court? You haven't argued\nmost of these. As I hear you now, you're pretty close\nto the SG. I mean, you'd like it all struck down, but\nif we are supposed to apply the objective test, I don't\nknow if you differ very much.\nSo, what do you propose that we do other\nthan spend a year reading all this and have you argue\nall of it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. What I would propose\nis the following, Justice Breyer, is you follow the\nargument this far and then you ask yourself whether what\nyou have left is a hollowed-out shell or whether you\nhave --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would say the Breast\nFeeding Act, the -- getting doctors to serve underserved\nareas, the biosimilar thing and drug regulation, the\nCLASS Act -- those have nothing to do with the stuff\nthat we've been talking about yesterday and the day\nbefore, okay?\nSo, if you tell me at that level, I'd say,\nsure, they have nothing to do with it; they could stand\non their own. The Indian thing, about helping the\nunderserved Native Americans -- all that stuff has\nnothing to do with it. Black lung disease, nothing to\ndo with it. Okay?\nSo, that's -- you know what you have there?\nA total off-the-cuff impression. So, that's why I'm\nasking you what should I do?\nMR. CLEMENT: What you should do is let me\nsay the following, which is follow me this far, which is\nthe mandatory, individual mandate is tied, as the\nGovernment suggests, to guaranteed issue and community\nrating, but the individual mandate, guaranteed issue,\nand community rating together are the heart of this Act.\nThey -- they're what make the exchanges work.\nThe exchanges in turn are critical to the\ntax credits, because the amount of the tax credit is key\nto the amount of the policy price on the exchange. The\nexchanges are also key to the employer mandate, because\nthe employer mandate becomes imposed on an employer if\none of the employees gets insurance on the exchanges.\nBut it doesn't stop there. Look at the\nMedicare provision for DSH hospitals, okay? These are\nhospitals that serve a disproportionate share of the\nneedy. This isn't in Title I. It's in the other part\nthat you had in your other hand. But it doesn't work\nwithout the mandate, community rating, and guaranteed\nissue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, can I ask you this,\nMr. Clement?\nMR. CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If -- what would your\nfallback position be if we don't accept the proposition\nthat if the mandate is declared unconstitutional, the\nrest of the Act, every single provision, has to fall?\nOther proposed -- other dispositions have been proposed.\nThere's the Solicitor General's disposition, the\nrecommended disposition to strike down the\nguaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions. One\nof the -- one amicus says strike down all of Title I;\nanother says strike down all of Title I and Title II.\nWhat -- what would you suggest?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think what I\nwould suggest, Justice Alito -- I don't want to be\nunresponsive -- is that you sort of follow the argument\nthrough and figure out what in the core of the Act\nfalls. And then I guess my fallback would be if what's\nleft is a hollowed-out shell, you could just leave that\nstanding.\nIf you want a sort of practical answer, I\nmean, I do think you could just -- you know, you could\nuse Justice Breyer's off-the-cuff as a starting point\nand basically say, you know, Title I and a handful of\nrelated provisions that are very closely related to that\nare really the heart of the Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\ndoesn't --\nMR. CLEMENT: The bigger volume in his other\nhand -- I mean, you could strike one and leave the\nother, but at a certain point -- I'm sorry,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your certain\npoint.\nMR. CLEMENT: At a certain point, I just\nthink that, you know, the better answer might be to say\nwe've struck the heart of this Act; let's just give\nCongress a clean slate. If it's so easy to have that\nother big volume get re-enacted, they can do it in a\ncouple of days. It won't be a big deal. If it's not,\nbecause it's very --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, but -- I mean, you can\nlaugh at me if you want, but the point is I rather\nsuspect that it won't be easy. Because I rather suspect\nthat if you actually dug into that, there'd be something\nthat was quite controversial in there and couldn't be\npassed quickly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reality --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- and that's our whole point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reality of the\npassage -- I mean, this was a piece of legislation\nwhich, there was -- had to be a concerted effort to\ngather enough votes so that it could be passed. And I\nsuspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions\nthat Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the\nprice of a vote: Put in the Indian health care\nprovision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages. Put\nin the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it.\nThat's why all -- many of these provisions,\nI think, were put in, not because they were\nunobjectionable. So, presumably, what Congress would\nhave done is they wouldn't have been able to put\ntogether, cobble together the votes to get it through.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, maybe that's right,\nMr. Chief Justice. And I don't want to, I mean, spend\nall my time on -- fighting over the periphery, because I\ndo think there are some provisions that I think you\nwould make, as an exercise of your own judgment, the\njudgment that once you've gotten rid of the core\nprovisions of this Act, that you would then decide to\nlet the periphery fall with it.\nBut if you want to keep the periphery,\nthat's fine. What I think is important, though, as to\nthe core provisions of the Act, which aren't just the\nmandate, community rating, and guaranteed issue, but\ninclude the exchanges, the tax credit, Medicare, and\nMedicaid -- as to all of that, I think you do want to\nstrike it all down to avoid a redux of Buckley.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere should be no occasion for the Court in\nthis case to consider issues of severability, because,\nas we argue, the -- the minimum coverage provision is\nfully consistent with Article I of the Constitution.\nBut if the Court were to conclude otherwise, it should\nreject Petitioners' sweeping proposition that the entire\nAct must fall if this one provision is held\nunconstitutional.\nAs an initial matter, we believe the Court\nshould not even consider that question. The vast\nmajority of the provisions of this Act do not even apply\nto the Petitioners, but instead apply to millions of\ncitizens and businesses who are not before the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does your\nproposal actually work? Your idea is that, well, they\ncan take care of it themselves later. I mean, do you\ncontemplate them bringing litigation and saying -- I\nguess the insurers would be the most obvious ones --\nwithout -- without the mandate, the whole thing falls\napart, and we're going to bear a greater cost, and so\nthe rest of the law should be struck down.\nAnd that's a whole other line of litigation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think the\ncontinuing validity of any particular provision would\narise in litigation that would otherwise arise under\nthat provision by parties who are actually --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what cause of\naction is it? I've never heard of a severability cause\nof action.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, in the first place, I\ndon't -- the point isn't that there has to be an\naffirmative cause of action to decide this. You\ncould -- for example, to use the Medicare reimbursement\nissues, one of the things this Act does is change\nMedicare reimbursement rates. Well, the place where\nsomeone adjudicates the validity of Medicare\nreimbursement rates is through the special statutory\nreview procedure for that.\nAnd the same thing is true of the\nAnti-Injunction Act --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, there are\nsome provisions which nobody would have standing to\nchallenge. If the provision is simply an expenditure of\nFederal money, it doesn't hurt anybody except the\ntaxpayer, but the taxpayer doesn't have standing. That\n-- that just continues. Even though it is -- it should\n-- it is so closely allied to what's been struck down\nthat it ought to go as well. But, nonetheless, that has\nto continue because there's nobody in the world that can\nchallenge it.\nCan that possibly be the law?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that proves our\npoint, Justice Scalia. This Court has repeatedly said\nthat just because there's -- no one may have standing to\nchallenge -- and particularly like tax credits or taxes\nwhich are challenged only after going through the\nAnti-Injunction Act, just because no one has standing\ndoesn't mean someone must.\nBut beyond that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But those are provisions\nthat have been legitimately enacted. The whole issue\nhere is whether these related provisions have been\nlegitimately enacted or whether they are so closely\nallied to one that has been held to be unconstitutional\nthat they also have not been legitimately enacted.\nYou can't compare that to -- to cases\ndealing with a statute that nobody denies is -- is\nconstitutional.\nMR. KNEEDLER: This case is directly\nparallel to the Printz case, in our view. In that case,\nthe Court struck down several provisions of the Brady\nAct but went on to say it had no business addressing the\nseverability of other provisions that did not apply to\nthe people before the Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what he's thinking --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is that a matter\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What he's thinking of is\nthis: I think Justice Scalia is thinking, I suspect, of\n-- imagine a tax which says this tax, amount Y, goes to\npurpose X, which will pay for half of purpose X. The\nother half will come from the exchanges somehow. That\nsecond half is unconstitutional. Purpose X can't\npossibly be carried out now with only half the money.\nDoes the government just sit there\ncollecting half the money forever because nobody can\never challenge it? You see, there -- if it were\ninextricably connected, is it enough to say, well, we\nwon't consider that because maybe somebody else could\nbring that case and then there is no one else?\nI mean, is that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, we think that is the\nproper way to proceed. Severability --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, it's not a\nchoice between someone else bringing the case and a law\nstaying in place. And what we're really talking about,\nas Justice Sotomayor started this discussion, is who is\nthe proper party to take out what isn't infected by the\nCourt's holding? With all these provisions where there\nmay be no standing, one institution clearly does have\nstanding, and that's Congress.\nAnd if Congress doesn't want the provisions\nthat are not infected to stand, Congress can take care\nof it.\nIt's a question of which side -- should the\nCourt say we're going to wreck the whole thing, or\nshould the Court leave it to Congress?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think the Court should\nleave it to Congress for two reasons. One is the point\nI'm making now about justiciability, or whether the\nCourt can properly consider it at all. And the second\nis we think only a few provisions are inseverable from\nthe minimum coverage provision.\nI just would like to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you go,\nMr. Kneedler, I'd like your answer to Justice Breyer's\nquestion.\nI think you were interrupted --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- before you had a\nchance --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, we believe that in that\ncase, the tax -- the tax provision should not be struck\ndown. In the first place, the Anti-Injunction Act would\nbar a direct suit to challenge it. And it would be very\nstrange to allow a tax to be struck down on the basis of\na severability analysis. Severability arises in a case\nonly where it's necessary to consider what relief a\nparty before the Court should get. The only party --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that there was a --\nsuppose there was a non-severability provision in -- in\nthis Act. If one provision were to be held\nunconstitutional, then every single -- someone would\nhave to bring a separate lawsuit challenging every\nsingle other provision in the Act and say, well, one\nfell and the Congress said it's all -- it's -- it's a\npackage, it can't be separated.\nThat's your position?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The fact that -- that such a\nclause might make it easy doesn't change the point.\nArticle III jurisdictional problems apply to easy\nquestions as well as hard questions. If I could just --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there's no Article III\njurisdictional problem in Justice Alito's hypothetical,\nthat this is a remedial exercise of the Court's power to\nexplain the consequences of its judgment in this case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But this Court had said that\none has to have standing for every degree of relief that\nis sought. That was in Davis. That was Los\nAngeles v. Lyons. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- Daimler/Chrysler.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't you think it's\nunrealistic to say leave it to Congress, as though\nyou're sending it back to Congress for Congress to\nconsider it dispassionately, on balance, should we have\nthis provision or should we not have provision? That's\nnot what it's going to be. It's going to be these\nprovisions are in effect, even though you -- a lot of\nyou never wanted them to be in effect and you only voted\nfor them because you wanted to get the heart of the --\nof the Act, which has now been cut out. But,\nnonetheless, these provisions are the law, and you have\nto get the votes to overturn them.\nThat's an enormously different question from\nwhether you get the votes initially to put them into the\nlaw.\nWhat -- there is no way that this Court's\ndecision is not going to distort the congressional\nprocess. Whether we strike it all down or leave some of\nit in place, the congressional process will never be the\nsame. One way or another, Congress is going to have to\nreconsider this. And why isn't it better to have them\nreconsider it -- what should I say -- in toto, rather\nthan having some things already in the law which you\nhave to eliminate before you can move on to consider\neverything on balance?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think, as a matter of\njudicial restraint, limits on equitable remedial power\nlimit this Court to addressing the provision that has\nbeen challenged as unconstitutional and anything else\nthat the plaintiff seeks as relief. Here the only\nthing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But when you say \"judicial\nrestraint\" --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, would you\nplease --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When you say \"judicial\nrestraint,\" you are echoing the earlier premise that it\nincreases the judicial power if the judiciary strikes\ndown other provisions of the Act. I suggest to you it\nmight be quite the opposite. We would be exercising the\njudicial power, if one Act was -- one provision was\nstricken and the others remained, to impose a risk on\ninsurance companies that Congress had never intended.\nBy reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that\nCongress did not provide for, did not consider. That,\nit seems to me, can be argued at least to be a more\nextreme exercise of judicial power than to strike --\nthan striking the whole.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think not, Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't accept the\npremise.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think not, Justice Kennedy,\nand then I'll move on.\nBut this is exactly the situation in Printz.\nThe Court identified the severability questions that\nwere -- that were briefed before the Court as important\nones but said that they affect people who are -- rights\nand obligations of people who are not before the Court.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, move away\nfrom the issue of whether it's a standing question or\nnot.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Make the assumption\nthat's an -- that this is an issue of the Court's\nexercise of discretion, because the last two questions\nhad to do with what's wise for the Court to do, not\nwhether it has power to do it or not.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, let's move beyond\nthe power issue, which your answers have centered on,\nand give me the sort of policy. And I know that's a --\nthat's a bugaboo word sometimes, but what should guide\nthe Court's discretion?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, we think that matters\nof justiciability do blend into --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you please --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I understand.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I've asked you three\ntimes to move around that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- blend into -- blend into\ndiscretion and, in turn, blend into the merits of the\nseverability question. And as to that, just to answer a\nquestion that several Justices have asked, we think that\nseverability is a matter of statutory interpretation.\nIt should be resolved by looking at the structure and\nthe text of the Act, and the Court may look at\nlegislative history to figure out what the text and\nstructure mean with respect to severability. We\ndon't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, what happened\nto the Eighth Amendment? You really want us to go\nthrough these 2,700 pages?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do you really expect\nthe Court to do that? Or do you expect us to give this\nfunction to our law clerks?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this not totally\nunrealistic, that we're going to go through this\nenormous bill item by item and decide each one?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the simple\nanswer was you don't have to because --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that is -- that is\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what we have to look\nat is what Congress said was essential, correct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is correct, and I'd also\nlike to -- going -- I just wanted to finish the thought\nI had about this being a matter of statutory\ninterpretation. The Court's task, we submit, is not to\nlook at the legislative process to see whether the bill\nwould have been -- would have passed or not based on the\npolitical situation at the time, which would basically\nconvert the Court into a function such as a whip count.\nThat is not the Court's function.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Kneedler, that\nwould be a revolution --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- in our severability law,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, we have never\nsuggested that we are going to say, look, this\nlegislation was a brokered compromise, and we're going\nto try to figure out exactly what would have happened in\nthe complex parliamentary shenanigans that go on across\nthe street and figure out whether they would have made a\ndifference.\nInstead, we look at the text that's actually\ngiven us. For some people, we look only at the text.\nIt should be easy for Justice Scalia's clerks.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether it's\neasy for my clerks. I care whether it's easy for me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that -- I think\nthat's exactly right. As I said, it is a question of\nstatutory interpretation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how is that --\nwhat's exactly right? It's a question of statutory\ninterpretation. That means you have to go through every\nline of the statute. I haven't heard your answer to\nJustice Scalia's question yet.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think in this case\nthere is an easy answer, and that is -- Justice Kagan\npointed out that that the Act itself creates a sharp\ndividing line between the minimum coverage provision --\nthe package of -- of reforms: The minimum coverage\nprovision along with the guaranteed issue and community\nrating. That is one package that Congress deemed\nessential.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know\nthat? Where is this line? I looked through the whole\nAct. I didn't read -- well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is -- it is in\nCongress's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is the sharp\nline?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is in Congress's findings\nthat the -- that the minimum coverage provision --\nwithout it, the Court -- the Congress said, in Finding\n(I), without that provision, people would wait to get\ninsurance, and therefore -- and cause all the adverse\nselection problems --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. That --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that gave rise to it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That makes your case\nthat the one provision should fall if the other does.\nIt doesn't tell us anything about all the other\nprovisions.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think -- I think\nit does, because Congress said it was essential to those\nprovisions, but it conspicuously did not say that it was\nessential to other provisions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you about the\nargument that's made in the economists' amicus brief?\nThey say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs\nof roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry and\nthat these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350\nbillion in new revenue from the individual mandate and\n350 billion from the Medicaid expansion.\nNow, if the 350 billion -- maybe you'll\ndisagree with the numbers, that they're fundamentally\nwrong. But assuming that they're in the ballpark, if\nthe 350 million from the individual mandate were to be\nlost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which\nwould now be in the -- in the hole for $350 billion over\n10 years?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I mean, first of\nall, for the Court to go beyond text and legislative\nhistory to try to figure out how the finances of a bill\noperated, it's like being the budget committee. But --\nbut we think the economists had added up the figures\nwrong. If there's Medicaid expansion, the insurance --\nand the insurance companies are involved in that,\nthey're going to be reimbursed for the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if there\nisn't Medicaid expansion? We've talked about the\nindividual mandate, but does the Government have a\nposition on what should happen if the Medicaid expansion\nis struck down?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We don't -- we don't think\nthat that would have any effect. And that could be\naddressed in the next argument. But we don't think that\nwould have any effect on the -- on the rest of the -- on\nthe rest of the Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it -- the\nGovernment's position is that if Medicaid expansion is\nstruck down, the rest of the Act can operate --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- without it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It's -- in the past,\nCongress has expanded Medicaid coverage without there\nbeing -- it's done it many times without there being a\nminimum coverage provision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still don't\nunderstand where you are with the answer to\nJustice Alito's question.\nAssume that there is a -- a substantial\nprobability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals\n7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate\nis stricken. Assume there is a significant possibility\nof that. Is it within the proper exercise of this\nCourt's function to impose that kind of risk? Can we\nsay that the Congress would have intended that there be\nthat kind of risk?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, we don't think it's in\nthe Court's place to look at the -- at the budgetary\nimplications, and we also --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that -- isn't\nthat the point, then, why we should just assume that it\nis not severable?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we -- if we lack the\ncompetence to even assess whether there is a risk, then\nisn't this an awesome exercise of judicial power?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To say we're doing\nsomething and we're not telling you what the\nconsequences might be?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't think so, because\nwhen you -- when you're talking about monetary\nconsequences, you're looking through the Act, you're\nlooking behind the Act, rather than -- the Court's\nfunction is to look at the text and structure of the Act\nand what the substantive provisions of the Act\nthemselves mean. And if I could go past --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, could I --\ncan you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this\none in which we are asked to strike down what the other\nside says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in --\nas you request, leave in effect the rest of it? Have we\never -- most of our severability cases, you know,\ninvolve one little aspect of the Act, and the question\nis whether the rest. When have we ever really struck\ndown what was the main purpose of the Act and left the\nrest in effect? Do you have a case for that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think Booker is the best\nexample of that. In Booker, the mandatory sentencing\nprovisions were central to the Act, but the -- but the\nCourt said Congress would have preferred a statute\nwithout the mandatory provision in the Act, and the\nCourt struck that, but the rest of the sentencing\nguidelines remained.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the reason -- the\nreason the majority said that was that they didn't think\nthat what was essential to the Act was what had been\nstricken down, and that is the -- the ability of the\njudge to say on his own what -- what the punishment\nwould be. I don't think that's a case where we\nstruck -- where we excised the heart of the statute.\nYou have another one?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's no example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no example. This\nis really --\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's no example to our --\nthat we have found that suggests the contrary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this really a case of\nfirst impression?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know another case\nwhere we have been confronted with this -- with this\ndecision.\nCan you take out the heart of the Act and\nleave everything else in place?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I would like to go to\n\"the heart of the Act\" point in a moment. But what I\nwould like to say is this is a huge act with many\nprovisions that are completely unrelated to market\nreforms and operate in different ways. And we think it\nwould be extraordinary in this extraordinary act to\nstrike all of that down because there are many\nprovisions and it would be too hard to do it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I think it's not\nuncommon that Congress passes an act, and then there are\nmany different titles, and some of the titles have\nnothing to do with the other titles. That's a common\nthing. And you're saying you've never found an instance\nwhere they're all struck out when they have nothing to\ndo with each other.\nMy question is -- because I hear Mr. Clement\nsaying something not too different from what you say.\nHe talks about things at the periphery. We can't reject\nor accept an argument on severability because it's a lot\nof work for us. That's beside the point. But do you\nthink that it's possible for you and Mr. Clement -- I'm\nexploring this -- to get together and agree on --\n(Laughter)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I mean, on a list of\nthings that are, in both your opinions, peripheral?\nThen you would focus on those areas where one of you\nthinks it's peripheral and one of you thinks it's not\nperipheral. And at that point, it might turn out to be\nfar fewer than we're currently imagining, at which point\nwe could hold an argument or figure out some way or\nsomebody would hold an argument and try to -- try to get\nthose done.\nIs that a pipe dream or is that a --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I just don't think\nthat's realistic. The Court would be doing it without\nthe parties, the millions of parties --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have a conference committee\nreport afterwards, maybe.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. No, it just -- it just\nis not something that a court would ordinarily do. But\nI would like --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you get back to\nthe argument of -- of the heart?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Striking down the heart,\ndo we want half a loaf or a shell?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think those are the\ntwo analogies that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And -- and I would\nlike to discuss it again in terms of the text and\nstructure of the Act. We have very important\nindications from the structure of this Act that the\nwhole thing is not supposed to fall.\nThe most basic one is the notion that\nCongress would have intended the whole Act to fall if\nthere couldn't be a minimum coverage provision is\nrefuted by the fact that there are many, many provisions\nof this Act already in effect without a minimum coverage\nprovision. Two point -- 2 and a half million people\nunder 26 have gotten insurance by one of the insurance\nrequirements, $3.2 billion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anticipation of the minimum\ncoverage. That's going to bankrupt the insurance\ncompanies, if not the States, unless this minimum\ncoverage provision comes into effect.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's no reason to think\nit's going to -- it's going to bankrupt anyone. The\ncosts will be set to cover those -- to cover those\namounts that are --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that the\n26-year-olds were saying that they were healthy and\ndidn't need insurance yesterday.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Two and a half --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, today they're going\nto bankrupt the --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Two and a half million people\nwould be -- would be thrown off the insurance rolls if\nthe Court were to say that. Congress made many changes\nto Medicare rates that have gone into effect. For\nCongress -- for the courts to have to unwind millions of\nMedicare reimbursement rates -- Medicare has covered 32\nmillion insurance -- preventive care visits by patients\nas a result of this Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of that was\nbased on the assumption that the mandate was\nconstitutional. And if -- that certainly doesn't stop\nus from reaching our own determination on that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but what I'm saying is\nit's a question of legislative intent, and we have a\nvery fundamental indication of legislative intent that\nit -- that Congress did not mean the whole Act to fall\nif -- without the minimum coverage provision, because we\nhave many provisions that are operating now without\nthat.\nBut there's a further indication about why\nthe line should be drawn where I've suggested, which is\nthe package of these particular provisions. All of the\nother provisions of the Act would continue to advance\nCongress's goal, as the test that was articulated in\nBooker, but it's been said in Regan and other cases.\nYou look to whether the other provisions can continue to\nadvance the purposes of the Act.\nHere they unquestionably can. The public\nhealth -- the broad public health purposes of the Act\nthat are unrelated to the minimum coverage provision but\nalso the other provisions designed to enhance affordable\n-- access to affordable care: The employer\nresponsibility provision, the credit for small\nbusinesses, which is already in effect, by the way, and\naffecting many small businesses. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But many people might\nnot -- many of the people in Congress might not have\nvoted for those provisions if the central part of this\nstatute was not adopted.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, you're --\nto say that we're effectuating the intent of Congress is\njust unrealistic. Once you've cut the guts out of it,\nwho knows, who knows which of them were really desired\nby Congress on their own and which ones weren't?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The question for the Court\nis, Congress having passed the law by whatever majority\nthere might be in one house or the other, Congress\nhaving passed the law, what at that point is -- is the\nlegislative intent embodied in the law Congress has\nactually passed?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's right.\nBut the problem is, straight from the title, we have two\ncomplementary purposes, patient protection and\naffordable care. And you can't look at something and\nsay this promotes affordable care; therefore, it's\nconsistent with Congress's intent. Because Congress had\na balanced intent. You can't look at another provision\nand say this promotes patient protection without asking\nif it's affordable.\nSo, it seems to me if you ask what is going\nto promote Congress's purpose, that's just an inquiry\nthat you can't carry out.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- with respect, I\ndisagree, because I think it's evident that Congress's\npurpose was to expand access to affordable care. It did\nit in discrete ways. It did it by the penalty on\nemployers that don't -- that don't offer suitable care.\nIt did it by offering tax credits to small employers.\nIt did it by offering tax credits to purchasers. All of\nthose are a variety of ways that continue to further\nCongress's goal. And most of all, Medicaid, which is --\nwhich is unrelated to -- to the private insurance market\naltogether.\nAnd in adopting those other provisions\ngoverning employers and whatnot, Congress built on its\nprior experience of using the tax code, which it has --\nfor a long period of time, Congress has subsidized the\nprovision of health care --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't quite understand\nabout the employers. You're saying Congress mandated\nemployers to buy something that Congress itself has not\ncontemplated? I don't understand that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Employer coverage -- 150\nmillion people in this country already get their\ninsurance through -- through their employers. What\nCongress did in seeking to augment that was to add a\nprovision requiring employers to purchase insurance or\npay a tax penalty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Based on the assumption\nthat the cost of those policies would be lowered\nby certain provisions which are, by hypothesis -- we're\nnot sure -- by hypothesis, are in doubt.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- I think it's -- any\ncost assumptions -- there's no indication that Congress\nmade any cost assumptions, but -- but there's no reason\nto think that the individual -- that the individual\nmarket, which is where the minimum coverage provision is\ndirected, would affect that.\nI would like to say -- I have pointed out\nwhy the other things would advance Congress's goal. The\npoint here is that the package of three things would be\ncontrary -- would run contrary to Congress's goal if you\ntook out the minimum coverage provision.\nAnd here's why -- and this is reflected in\nthe findings. If you take out minimum coverage but\nleave in the guaranteed issue and community rating, you\nwill make matters worse. Rates will go up, and people\n-- there will be less -- fewer people covered in the\nindividual market.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that is true, what\nis the difference between guaranteed-issue and\ncommunity-rating provisions, on the one hand, and other\nprovisions that increase costs substantially for\ninsurance companies?\nFor example, the tax on high cost health\nplans, which the economists' amicus brief said will cost\n$217 billion over 10 years?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Those are -- what Congress --\nCongress did not think of those things as balancing\ninsurance companies. Insurance companies are\nparticipants in the market for Medicaid and -- and other\nthings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're saying we have\n-- we have the expertise to make the inquiry you want us\nto make, i.e., the guaranteed issue, but not the\nexpertise that Justice Alito's question suggests we must\nmake.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand\nyour position.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that's because -- that's\nbecause I think this Court's function is to look at the\ntext and structure and the legislative history of the\nlaw that Congress enacted, not the financial -- not a\nfinancial balance sheet, which doesn't appear anywhere\nin the law. And just --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're relying on\nCongress's quite explicitly tying these three things\ntogether.\nMR. KNEEDLER: We do. That's -- that's --\nand it's not just the text of the Act, but the\nbackground of the Act, the experience in the States, the\ntestimony of the National Association of Insurance\nCommissioners.\nThat's the -- that's the problem Congress\nwas addressing. There was a -- there was -- a shifting\nof present actuarial risks in that market that Congress\nwanted to correct. And if you took the minimum coverage\nprovision out and left the other two provisions in,\nthere would be laid on top of the existing shifting of\npresent actuarial risks an additional one because the\nuninsured would know that they would have guaranteed\naccess to insurance whenever they became sick. It would\nmake the -- it would make the adverse selection in that\nmarket problem even worse.\nAnd so, what -- and Congress, trying to come\nup with a market-based solution to control rates in that\nmarket, has adopted something that would -- that would\nwork to control costs by guaranteed issue and community\nrating, but if you -- if -- if you take out the minimum\ncoverage, that won't work. That was Congress's\nassumption, again, shown by the text and legislative\nhistory of this provision. And that's why we think\nthose things rise or fall in a package, because they cut\nagainst what Congress was trying to do.\nAll of the other provisions would actually\nincrease access to affordable care and would have\nadvantageous effects on price. Again, Congress was\ninvoking its traditional use of the tax code, which has\nlong subsidized insurance through employers, has used\nthat to impose a tax penalty on -- on employers, to give\ntax credits. This is traditional stuff that Congress\nhas done.\nAnd the other thing Congress has done, those\npre-existing laws had their own protections for\nguaranteed issue and community rating. Effectively,\nwithin the large employer plans, they can't discriminate\namong people. They can't charge different rates. What\nCongress was doing, was doing that in the other market.\nIf it can't, that's all that should be struck from the\nAct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Farr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III,\nAS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAt the outset, I would just like to say I\nthink that the Government's position in this case that\nthe community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions\nought to be struck down is an example of the best\ndriving out the good, because, even without the minimum\ncoverage provision, those two provisions, guaranteed\nissue and community rating, will still open insurance\nmarkets to millions of people that were excluded under\nthe prior system and for millions of people will lower\nprices, which were raised high under the old system\nbecause of their poor health.\nSo, even though the system is not going to\nwork precisely as Congress wanted, it would certainly\nserve central goals that Congress had of expanding\ncoverage for people who were unable to get coverage or\nunable to get it at affordable prices.\nSo, when the government --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the points that\nMr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable\nbecause the -- he spoke of the adverse selection\nproblem, that there would be so fewer people in there,\nthe insurance companies are going to have to raise the\npremiums.\nSo, it's nice that Congress made it possible\nfor more people to be covered, but the reality is they\nwon't because they won't be able to afford the premium.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me\nsay two things about that.\nFirst of all, when we talk about premiums\nbecoming less affordable, it's very important to keep in\nmind different groups of people, because it is not\nsomething that applies accurately to everybody.\nFor people who were not able to get\ninsurance before, obviously, their insurance beforehand\nwas -- the price was essentially infinite. They were\nnot able to get it at any price. They will now be able\nto get it at a price that they can afford.\nFor people who are unhealthy and were able\nto get insurance, but perhaps not for the things that\nthey were most concerned about, or only at very high\nrates, their rates will be lower under the system, even\nwithout the minimum coverage provision.\nAlso, you have a large number of people who,\nunder the Act --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why do you\nsay -- I didn't follow that. Why?\nMR. FARR: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would their rates be\nlower?\nMR. FARR: Their rates are going to be lower\nthan they were under the prior system because they are\ngoing into a pool of people, rather than -- some of whom\nare healthy, rather than having their rates set\naccording to their individual health characteristics.\nThat's why their rates were so high.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the problem, Mr. Farr,\nisn't it, that they're going to a pool of people that\nwill gradually get older and unhealthier. That's the\nway the thing works. Once you say that the insurance\ncompanies have to cover all of the sick people and all\nof the old people, the -- the rates climb. More and\nmore young people and healthy people say why should we\nparticipate; we can just get it later when we get sick.\nSo, they leave the market. The rates go up further.\nMore people leave the market. And the whole system\ncrashes and burns, becomes unsustainable.\nMR. FARR: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And this is not --\nMR. FARR: Sorry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- like what I think. What\ndo I know? It's just what -- what's reflected in\nCongress's findings, that it's -- it looks at some\nStates and says this system crashed and burned. It\nlooked at another State with the minimum coverage\nprovision and said this one seems to work; so, we'll\npackage the minimum coverage provision with the\nnondiscrimination provisions.\nMR. FARR: Well, in a moment, I'd like to\ntalk about the finding, but if I could just postpone\nthat for a second and talk about adverse selection\nitself.\nI think one of the misconceptions here,\nJustice Kagan, is that Congress, having seen the\nexperience of the States in the '90s with community\nrating and guaranteed issue, simply imposed the minimum\ncoverage provision as a possible way of dealing with\nthat, and if you don't have the minimum coverage\nprovision, then, essentially, adverse selection runs\nrampant. But that's not what happened.\nCongress included at least half a dozen\nother provisions to deal with adverse selection caused\nby bringing in people who are less healthy into the Act.\nThere are -- to begin with, the Act\nauthorizes annual enrollment periods so people can't\njust show up at the hospital. If they don't show up and\nsign up at the right time, they at least have to wait to\nthe -- to the time next year. That's authorized by the\nAct.\nThere -- with respect to the subsidies,\nthere are three different things that make this\nimportant. First of all, the subsidies are very\ngenerous. For people below 200 percent of the Federal\npoverty line, the subsidy will cover 80 percent, on\naverage, of the premium, which makes it attractive to\nthem to join.\nThe structure of the subsidies, because\ntheir income -- they create a floor for -- based on the\nincome of the person getting the insurance, and then the\ngovernment covers everything over that. And this is\nimportant in adverse selection because if you do have a\nchange in the mix of people and average premiums start\nto rise, the government picks up the increase in the\npremium. The amount that the person who is getting\ninsured contributes remains constant at a percentage of\nhis or her income.\nAnd the third thing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is nothing about\nFederal support that is unsustainable, right? That is\ninfinite.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARR: Well, I mean, that's a fair\npoint, Justice Scalia, although one of the things that\nhappens, if you take the mandate out, while it is true\nthat the subsidies that the government provides to any\nindividual will increase, and they will be less\nefficient -- I'm not disputing that point -- actually,\nthe overall amount of the subsidies that the government\nwill provide will decline, as the Government notes\nitself in its brief, because there will be fewer people\ngetting them. Some people will opt out of the system\neven though they're getting subsidies.\nBut I'd just like to go back for one more\nsecond to the point about how the subsidies are part of\nwhat Congress was using, because the other thing is that\nfor people below 250 percent of the Federal poverty\nline, Congress also picks up and subsidizes the\nout-of-pocket costs, raising the actuarial value.\nSo, you have all of that, and then you have\nCongress also, unlike the States, establishing -- or I\nshould be precisely accurate -- unlike almost all the\nStates, establishing an age differential of up to three\nto one. So, an insurance company, for example, that is\nselling a 25-year-old a policy for $4,000 can charge a\n60-year-old $12,000 for exactly the same coverage.\nThe States typically in the '90s, when they\nwere instituting these programs, they either had pure\ncommunity rating, where everybody is charged the same\npremium -- everybody regardless of their age is charged\nthe same premium. Some States had a variance of 1.5\nto 1. Massachusetts, for example, which did have good\nsubsidies, but their age band was two to one.\nSo, when Congress is enacting this Act, it's\nnot simply looking at the States and thinking: Well,\nthat didn't go very well. Why don't we put in a minimum\ncoverage provision? That will solve the problem.\nCongress did a lot of different things to\ntry to combat the adverse selection.\nNow, if I could turn to the finding, because\nI think this is the crux of the Government's position,\nand then the plaintiffs pick up on that and then move --\nmove from that to the rest of the Act. And it seems to\nme, quite honestly, it's an important part because that\nis textual. You know, in this whole sort of quest for\nwhat we're trying to figure out, the finding seems to\nstand out as something that the Court can rely on and\nsay here's something Congress has actually told us.\nBut I think the real problem with the\nfinding is the -- the context in which Congress made it.\nIt's quite clear. If the Court wants to look, the\nfinding is on page 42 -- 43a, excuse me, of the\nSolicitor General's severability brief, in the appendix.\nBut the finding is made specifically in the\ncontext of interstate commerce. That is why the\nfindings are in the Act at all. Congress wanted to\nindicate to the Court, knowing that the minimum coverage\nprovision was going to be challenged, wanted to indicate\nto the Court the basis on which it believed it had the\npower under the Commerce Clause to enact this law.\nWhy does that make a difference with respect\nto Finding (I), which is the one that the Government is\nrelying on, and in particular the last sentence, which\nsays this requirement \"is essential to creating\neffective health insurance markets\" in which guaranteed\nissue and pre-existing illnesses can be covered.\nAnd the reason is because the word\n\"essential\" in the Commerce Clause context doesn't have\nthe colloquial meaning. In the Commerce Clause context,\n\"essential\" effectively means useful. So that when one\nsays -- in Lopez, when the Court says section 922(q) is\nnot an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme of\neconomic activity, it goes on to say: In which the\nregulatory scheme would be undercut if we didn't have\nthis provision.\nWell, if that's all Congress means, I agree\nwith that. The system will be undercut somewhat if you\ndon't have the minimum coverage provision. It's like\nthe word \"necessary\" in the Necessary and Proper Clause\nClause. It doesn't mean, as the Court has said on\nnumerous occasions, absolutely necessary. It means\nconducive to, useful, advancing the objectives,\nadvancing the aims. And it's easy to see, I think, that\nthat's what Congress did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any dictionary\nthat gives that --\nMR. FARR: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that definition of\n\"essential\"? It's very imaginative.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just give me one\ndictionary.\nMR. FARR: Well -- but I think my point,\nJustice Scalia, is that they're not using it in the true\ndictionary sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do we know that? When\npeople speak, I assume they're speaking English.\nMR. FARR: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARR: I think that there are several\nreasons that I would suggest that we would know that\nfrom. The first is, as I say, the findings themselves.\nCongress says at the very beginning -- the head of it is\nCongress makes the following findings. And they're\ntalking about the interstate -- you know, (B) is headed\n\"Effects on the national economy and interstate\ncommerce.\" So, we know the context that Congress is\ntalking about. It is more or less quoting from the\nCourt's Commerce Clause statement.\nBut if one looks at the very preceding\nfinding, which is Finding (H), which is on 42 over onto\n43, Congress at that point also uses the word\n\"essential.\" In the second sentence, it says this\nrequirement -- and again, we're talking about the\nminimum coverage provision -- \"is an essential part of\nthis larger regulation of economic activity,\" which is,\nby the way, an exact quote from Lopez, in which \"the\nabsence of the requirement would undercut Federal\nregulation,\" also an exact quote from Lopez.\nBut what it's referring to is essential --\nan essential part of ERISA, the National Health Service\nAct, and the Affordable Care Act. It can't possibly be,\neven the plaintiffs haven't argued, that those acts\nwould all fall in their entirety if you took out the\nminimum coverage provision.\nAnd as a second example of the same usage by\nCongress, the statute that was before the Court in\nRaich, section 801 of Title 21, the Court said that the\nregulation of intrastate drug activity, drug traffic,\nwas essential to the regulation of interstate drug\nactivity. Again, it is simply not conceivable that\nCongress was saying one is so indispensable to the\nother, the way the United States uses the term here, so\nindispensable that if we can't regulate the intrastate\ntraffic, we don't want to regulate the interstate\ntraffic, either. The whole law criminalizing drug\ntraffic would fall.\nSo, I think once you look at the finding for\nwhat I believe it says, which is we believe this is a\nuseful part of our regulatory scheme, which the Congress\nwould think in its own approach would be sufficient --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nMR. FARR: Yes, Justice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem I have is\nthat you're ignoring the congressional findings and all\nof the evidence Congress had before it that community\nratings and guaranteed issuance would be a death\nspiral -- I think that was the word that was used --\nwithout minimum coverage. Those are all of the\nmaterials that are part of the legislative record here.\nSo, even if it might not be because of the\nstructure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence. Why\nshould we be looking at that as opposed to what Congress\nhad before it and use \"essential\" in its plain meaning:\nYou can't have minimum coverage without, what the SG is\narguing, community ratings and guaranteed issue. You\ncan't have those two without minimum coverage.\nMR. FARR: Well, I think that's a fair\nquestion. But the idea that -- that all the information\nbefore Congress only led to the idea that if -- that you\nwould have death spirals seems to me to be contradicted\na little bit at least by the CBO report in November of\n2009, which is about 4 months before the Act passed,\nwhere the CBO talks about adverse selection.\nNow, I want to be clear. This is at a time\nwhen the minimum coverage provision was in the statute.\nSo, I'm not suggesting that this is a discussion without\nthat in it. But, nonetheless, the CBO goes through and\ntalks about adverse selection and -- and points out the\ndifferent provisions in the Act, the ones I have\nmentioned plus one other, actually, where in the first 3\nyears of the operation of the exchanges, those insurance\ncompanies that get sort of a worse selection of -- of\nconsumers will be given essentially credits from\ninsurance companies that get better selection.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, do you want us to\nwrite an opinion saying we have concluded that there is\nan insignificant risk of a substantial adverse effect on\nthe insurance companies -- that's our economic\nconclusion -- and therefore not severable? That's what\nyou want me to say?\nMR. FARR: It doesn't sound right the way\nyou say it, Justice Kennedy. So --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARR: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you don't want them\nto say, either, that there is a death spiral. Do you\nwant -- you don't want us to make either of those two\nfindings, I'm assuming.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. Now, I -- I\nagree that there's a risk and the significance of it\npeople can debate. But what I think is -- is lost in\nthat question -- and I didn't mean to be whimsical about\nit. I think what is lost in it a little bit is what's\non the other side, which is the fact that if you follow\nthe Government's suggestion, if the Court follows the\nGovernment's suggestion, what is going to be lost is\nsomething we know is a central part of the Act. I mean,\nindeed, if one sort of looks at the legislative history\nmore broadly, I think much of it is directed toward the\nidea that guaranteed issue and community rating were the\ncrown jewel of the Act.\nThe minimum coverage provision wasn't\nsomething that everybody was bragging about. It was\nsomething that was meant to be part of this package. I\nagree with that.\nBut the -- but the point of it was to have\nguaranteed issue and minimum coverage. I mean -- excuse\nme -- guaranteed issue and community rating. And that's\n-- under the Government's proposal, those would\ndisappear. We would go back to the old system.\nAnd under what I think is the proper\nseverability analysis, the -- the real question the\nCourt is asking, should be asking, is, would Congress\nrather go back to the old system than to take perhaps\nthe risk that you're talking about, Justice Kennedy?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you're\nreferring to the Government's second position. Their\nfirst, of course, is that we shouldn't address this\nissue at all.\nMR. FARR: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I asked Mr. Kneedler\nabout what procedure or process would be anticipated for\npeople who are affected by the change in -- in the law\nand the change in the economic consequences. Do you\nhave a view on how that could be played out? It does\nseem to me that if we accept your position, something --\nthere have to -- there has to be a broad range of\nconsequences, whether it's additional legislation,\nadditional litigation.\nAny thoughts on how that's going to play\nout?\nMR. FARR: Well, if the Court adopts the\nposition that I'm advocating, Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nwhat would happen is that the Court would say that the\nminimum coverage provision, by hypothesis of course, is\nunconstitutional, and the fact of that being\nunconstitutional does not mean the invalidation of any\nother provision.\nSo, under the position I'm advocating, there\nwould no longer be challenges to the remaining part of\nthe Act. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the challenge\nis what we're questioning today, whether -- if you're an\ninsurance company and you don't believe that you can\ngive the coverage in the way Congress mandated it\nwithout the individual mandate, what -- what type of\naction do you bring in court?\nMR. FARR: You -- if the Court follows the\ncourse that I'm advocating, you do not bring an action\nin court. You go to Congress and you seek a change from\nCongress to say the minimum coverage provision has been\nstruck down by the Court: Here is our -- here -- here's\nthe information that we have to show you what the risks\nare going to be. Here are the adjustments you need to\nmake.\nOne of the questions earlier pointed out\nthat States have adjusted their systems as they've gone\nalong, as they've seen things work or not work.\nYou know, as I was talking earlier about the\n-- the different ratio for ages in insurance. The\nStates have tended to change that because they found\nthat having too narrow a band worked against the\neffectiveness of their programs. But they -- except for\nin Massachusetts, they didn't enact mandates.\nSo, to answer -- I think to answer your\nquestion directly, Mr. Chief Justice, the position I'm\nadvocating would simply have those -- those pleas go to\nCongress, not in court.\nNow, if one -- just to discuss the issue\nmore generally, if that's helpful, I think that if there\nwere situations where the Court deferred -- let's say\nfor discretionary reasons, they just said -- the Court\nsaid we're not going to take up the question of\nseverability and therefore not resolve it in these other\nsituations, it certainly seems to me that in enforcement\nactions, for example, if the time comes in 2014 and\nsomebody applies to an insurance company for a\npolicy and the insurance company says, well, we're not\ngoing to issue a policy, we don't think your risks are\nones that we're willing to cover -- it seems to me that\nthey could sue the insurance company and the insurance\ncompany could raise as a defense that this provision,\nthe guaranteed-issue provision of the statute, is not\nenforceable because it was inseverable from the decision\n-- from the provision that the Court held\nunconstitutional in 2012.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Farr, let's consider\nhow -- how your approach, severing as little as\npossible, thereby increases the deference that we're\nshowing to Congress. It seems to me it puts Congress in\nthis position: This Act is still in full effect. There\nis going to be this deficit that used to be made up by\nthe mandatory coverage provision. All that money has to\ncome from somewhere. You can't repeal the rest of the\nAct because you're not going to get 60 votes in the\nSenate to repeal the rest. It's not a matter of\nenacting a new Act. You got to get 60 votes to repeal\nit. So, the rest of the Act is going to be the law.\nSo, you're just put to the choice of, I\nguess, bankrupting insurance companies and the whole\nsystem comes tumbling down, or else enacting a Federal\nsubsidy program to the insurance companies, which is\nwhat the insurance companies would like, I'm sure.\nDo you really think that that is somehow\nshowing deference to Congress and respecting the\ndemocratic process?\nIt seems to me it's a gross distortion of\nit.\nMR. FARR: Well, Your Honor, the difficulty\nis that it seems to me the other possibility is for the\nCourt to make choices particularly based on what it\nexpects the difficulties of Congress altering the\nlegislation after a Court ruling would be. I'm not\naware of any severability decision that has ever looked\nanything like that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I -- that wouldn't be\nmy approach. My approach would say, if you take the\nheart out of the statute, the statute's gone. That\nenables Congress to do what it wants in the usual\nfashion. And it doesn't inject us into the process of\nsaying: This is good, this is bad, this is good, this\nis bad.\nMR. FARR: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it reduces\nour options the most and increases Congress's the most.\nMR. FARR: And I guess to some extent I have\nto quarrel with the premise, Justice Scalia, because at\nleast the position that I'm advocating today, under\nwhich the Court would only take out the minimum coverage\nprovision, I don't think would fit the description that\nyou have given of taking out the heart of the statute.\nNow, I do think once you take out guaranteed\nissue and community rating, you're getting closer to the\nheart of the statute. And one of the -- one of the\ndifficulties I think with the Government's position is\nthat I think it's harder to cabin that, to draw that\nbright line around it. It's harder than the Government\nthinks it is.\nI mean, to begin with, even the Government\nseems to acknowledge, I think, that the exchanges are\ngoing to be relatively pale relatives of the exchanges\nas they're intended to be, where you're going to have\nstandardized products, everybody can come and make\ncomparisons based on products that look more or less the\nsame.\nBut the other thing that's going to happen\nis with the subsidy program. The way that the subsidy\nprogram is set up, the subsidy is calculated according\nto essentially a benchmark plan. And this -- if one --\nif the Court wants to look at the provisions, they're --\nthey begin at page 64a of the private plaintiffs' brief.\nAgain, in the appendix. The particular provision I'm\ntalking about's at 68a. But there's a -- there's a\nquestion -- you -- you're looking essentially to\ncalculate the premium by looking at a -- at a\nstandardized silver plan.\nFirst question, obviously, is: Is there\ngoing to be any such plan if you don't have guaranteed\nissue and community rating, if the plans can basically\nbe individualized? But the second problem is that, in\nthe provision on 68a, the -- the provision that's used\nfor calculating the subsidy, what -- what is anticipated\nin the provision under the Act, as it is now, is that\nyou do have the floor of the income. You would -- you\nwould take this benchmark plan, and the government would\npay the difference.\nAnd as we talked about earlier, the\nbenchmark plan can change for age, and -- and the\nprovision says it can be adjusted only for age. So, if\nin fact you even have such a thing as a benchmark plan\nanymore, if the rates of people in poor health go up\nbecause of individual insurance underwriting, the\ngovernment subsidy is not going to pay for that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Farr, I understood that\nthe answer that you gave to Justice Scalia was\nessentially that the minimum coverage provision was not\nthe heart of the Act. Instead, the minimum coverage\nprovision was a tool to make the nondiscrimination\nprovisions -- community rating, guaranteed issue --\nwork.\nSo, if you assume that, that all the minimum\ncoverage is, is a tool to make those provisions work,\nthen I guess I would refocus Justice Scalia's question\nand say, if we know that something is just a tool to\nmake other provisions work, shouldn't that be the case\nin which those other provisions are severed along with\nthe tool?\nMR. FARR: No, I don't think so, because\nthere are -- there are many other tools to make the same\nthings work. That's I think the point.\nAnd if one -- and the case that comes to\nmind is New York v. The United States, where the Court\nstruck down the \"take title\" provision but left other --\ntwo other incentives essentially in place.\nEven without the minimum coverage provision,\nthere will be a lot of other incentives still to bring\nyounger people into the market and to keep them in the\nmarket. And if -- if my reading of the finding is\ncorrect -- and that's all that Congress is saying, that\nthis would be useful -- it doesn't mean that it's\nimpossible to have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But would you -- I'd just\nlike to hear before you leave your argument, if you want\nto, against what Justice Scalia just said. Let's\nassume, contrary to what you want, that the Government's\nposition is accepted by the majority of this Court. And\nso, we now are rid, quote, of the true \"heart\" of the\nbill. Now, still there are a lot of other provisions\nhere like the Indian Act, the black lung disease, the\nwellness program, that restaurants have to have a\ncalorie count of major menus, et cetera.\nNow, some of them cost money, and some of\nthem don't. And there are loads of them. Now, what is\nyour argument that just because the heart of the bill is\ngone, that has nothing to do with the validity of these\nother provisions, both those that cost money or at least\nthose that cost no money? Do you want to make an\nargument in that respect, that destroying the heart of\nthe bill does not blow up the entire bill; it blows up\nthe heart of a bill? And I'd just like to hear what you\nhave to say about that.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nwhat I would say is, if one goes back to the -- what I\nthink is the proper severability standard and say, would\nCongress rather have not -- no bill as opposed to the\nbill with whatever is severed from it, it seems to me\nwhen you're talking about provisions that don't have\nanything to do with the minimum coverage provision,\nthere's no reason to answer that question as any other\nway than yes, Congress would want these provisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the real Congress\nor a hypothetical Congress?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FARR: An objective Congress, Your\nHonor, not the specific -- not with a vote count.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you come across --\nMR. FARR: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why put -- why put Congress\nto that false choice?\nMR. FARR: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know -- you only have\ntwo choices, Congress. You can have the whole bill or\nyou can have -- you can have parts of the bill or no\nbill at all. Why that false choice?\nMR. FARR: I think the reason is because\nseverability is by necessity a blunt tool. The Court\ndoesn't have -- even if it had the inclination, doesn't\nessentially have the authority to retool the statute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Oh, I know. So, you\n-- I would say stay out of politics. That's for\nCongress, not us.\nMR. FARR: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the question\nhere is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have\nyou ever found a severability case where the Court ever\nsaid: Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and,\ntherefore, we strike down these other provisions that\nhave nothing to do with it, which could stand on their\nfeet independently and can be funded separately or don't\nrequire money at all.\nMR. FARR: I think the accurate answer would\nbe I am not aware of a modern case that says that. I\nthink there probably are cases in the '20s and '30s that\nwould be more like that.\nIf I could just take one second to address\nthe economists' brief because Justice Alito raised it\nearlier. I just want to make one simple point. Leaving\naside the whole balancing thing, if one looks at the\neconomists' brief, I think it's very important to note\nthat when they're talking about one side of the balance\n-- may I finish?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. FARR: When they're talking about the\nbalance, they're not just talking about the minimum\ncoverage provision. They very carefully word it to say\nthe minimum coverage provision and the subsidy programs.\nAnd then, so when you're doing the mathematical\nbalancing, the subsidy programs are extremely large.\nThey -- in year 2020, they're expected to be over\n$100 billion in that one year alone. So, if you're\nlooking at the numbers, please consider that.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Farr.\nMr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, could you\nrespond to amici's point? He says that Congress didn't\ngo into this Act to impose minimum coverage. They went\ninto the Act to have a different purpose, i.e., to get\npeople coverage when they needed it, to increase\ncoverage for people, that this is only a tool. But\nother States -- going back to my original point, that\nthere are other tools besides minimum coverage that\nCongress can achieve the same goals. So, if we strike\njust a tool, why should we strike the whole Act --\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when Congress has\nother tools available?\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, I'll make\nfour points in rebuttal, but I'll start with Justice\nSotomayor's question, which is to simply say this isn't\njust a tool; it's the principal tool. Congress\nidentified it as an essential tool. It's not just a\ntool to make it work. It's a tool to pay for it, to\nmake it affordable. And, again, that's not my\ncharacterization; that's Congress's characterization in\nSub-finding (I) on page 43a of the Government's brief.\nNow, that brings me to my first point in\nrebuttal, which is Mr. Kneedler says, quite correctly --\ntells this Court don't look at the budgetary\nimplications. Well, the problem with that, though, is\nonce it's common ground that the individual mandate is\nin the statute at least in part to make community rating\nand guaranteed issue affordable, that really is all you\nhave to identify. That establishes the essential link\nthat it's there to pay for it.\nYou don't have to figure out exactly how\nmuch that is and which box -- I mean, it clearly is a\nsubstantial part of it, because what they were trying to\ndo was take healthy individuals and put them into the\nrisk pool -- and this is quoting their finding -- which\nis in order -- they put people into the market, which\nwill lower premiums. So, that's what their intent was.\nSo, you don't have to get to the final\nnumber. You know that's what was going on here, and\nthat's reason alone to sever it.\nNow, the Government -- Mr. Kneedler also\nsays there's an easy dividing line between what they\nwant to keep and what they want to dish out. The\nproblem with that is that, you know, you read their\nbrief and you might think, oh, there's a\nguaranteed-issue and a community-rating provision\nsubtitle in the bill. There's not.\nTo figure out what they're talking about you\nhave to go to page 6 of their brief, of their opening\nseverability brief, where they tell you what's in and\nwhat's out. And the easy dividing line they suggest is\nactually between 300g(a)(1) and 300g(a)(2), because on\ncommunity rating, they don't -- they say that (a)(1)\ngoes, but then they say (a)(2) has to stay because\nthat's the way that you'll have some sort of -- kind of\nPotemkin community rating for the exchanges. But if you\nactually look at those provisions, (a)(2) makes all\nthese references to (a)(1). It just doesn't work.\nNow, in getting back to the -- an inquiry\nthat I think this Court actually can approach is, to\nlook at what Congress was trying to do, you need look no\nfurther than the title of this statute: Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care. I agree with Mr. Farr\nthat community rating and guaranteed issue were the\ncrown jewels of this Act. They were what was trying to\nprovide patient protection. And what made it\naffordable? The individual mandate. If you strike down\nguaranteed issue, community rating, and the individual\nmandate, there is nothing left to the heart of the Act.\nAnd that takes me to my last point, which is\nsimply this Court in Buckley created a halfway house,\nand it took Congress 40 years to try to deal with the\nsituation, when contrary to any time of their intent,\nthey had to try to figure out what are we going to do\nwhen we're stuck with this ban on contributions, but we\ncan't get at expenditures because the Court told us we\ncouldn't. And for 40 years, they worked in that halfway\nhouse.\nWhy make them do that in health care? The\nchoice is to give Congress the task of fixing this\nstatute, the residuum of this statute after some of it\nis struck down, or giving them the task of simply fixing\nthe problem on a clean slate. I don't think that's a\nclose choice. If the individual mandate is\nunconstitutional, the rest of the Act should fall.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\nMr. Farr, you were invited by this Court to\nbrief and argue in these cases in support of the\ndecision below on severability.
