        "content": "(11:20 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-188, Schindler Elevator Corporation v.\nUnited States ex rel. Daniel Kirk.\nMr. Reiss.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REISS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether a FOIA\nresponse is a report or investigation within the meaning\nof the False Claims Act public disclosure bar. Our\nposition that it is allows the Court to reach the\ncritical question whether a relator has contributed\ngenuinely valuable information. The position taken by\nMr. Kirk and the Government would disallow the public\ndisclosure bar before reaching that critical issue, and\nit would therefore lead to a host of lawsuits by\nrelators with no meaningful information to contribute,\nand that is precisely the result that the public -- the\npublic disclosure bar is intended to prohibit.\nNow -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose the FOIA\ninformation is just to confirm, to back up, to fill out;\nthat the -- the relator suspects there's a fraud going\non, and he thinks that the -- the fraud will be\ndocumented by filings that the alleged fraudulent party\nhas made in the government.\nMR. REISS: Justice -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. REISS: Justice Ginsburg, that may well\nbe a legitimate use of a FOIA request, and the question\nthen becomes whether the information disclosed in the\nFOIA response reveals the allegations and transactions\nupon which the qui tam suit is based. But that\nquestion, that use by a relator of the FOIA process,\ndoesn't go to whether or not a FOIA response is itself a\nreport or investigation within the statute.\nA relator can still escape the public\ndisclosure bar if the relator can demonstrate that his\ncomplaint is not based upon the allegations and\ntransactions that are disclosed in the FOIA response.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So in each case, we'd\nhave to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was\nit so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the\nFOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of\nthe -\nMR. REISS: Precisely, Justice Ginsburg. In\nfact, what a court should do is precisely what the\ndistrict court did in this very case in a very thorough\nopinion. Judge Stein went through every element\nrequired for the public disclosure bar to be invoked,\nincluding whether the FOIA response was a report or\ninvestigation, including whether Mr. Kirk's complaint\nwas based on allegations and transactions disclosed in\nthat FOIA response, and concluded that every prong of\nthe disclosure -- public disclosure bar was met, and,\ntherefore, the public disclosure bar prevented\nMr. Kirk's claims. And that is precisely the analysis\nthat we contend ought to happen.\nUnder the Government's position and\nMr. Kirk's position, you never get to the critical\ninquiries about whether the allegations in a relator's\ncomplaint were publicly disclosed in a report or\ninvestigation, because under their view, a FOIA response\nitself is rarely going to qualify as a -- as an\nadministrative report or as an administrative\ninvestigation.\nWe think that view is plainly incorrect\nunder the ordinary uses of the words \"report or\ninvestigation,\" a position that was obviously found to\nbe the case by the First, Fifth, and Third Circuits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If I -- if I submitted,\nas we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure\nstatements to an administrative office, and then someone\nfrom the press has a Freedom of Information Act request\nto see that financial disclosure statement, does it then\nbecome -- does it become the report of the\nadministrative office, rather than my report to the\nadministrative office?\nMR. REISS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's\nan interesting question, and whether -- and some lower\ncourts have held that if the Federal -- if the -- if the\nreport -- even though the report is filled out by a\nnongovernmental person, such as yourself in this\ninstance, it might still qualify as an administrative\nreport because the information being sought is dictated\nby a Federal administrative agency.\nNow, we don't think you have to reach that\nposition for -- for Schindler to prevail here, because\nthe one thing that is clear is that a FOIA response by\nthe Department of Labor is itself an administrative\nreport or investigation. It is a Federal -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that in this case,\nthe agency has said: Well, we have 10 files where these\ndocuments are, and we'll make them available you to in\nthe reading room. Go to the reading room.\nIs that a report?\nMR. REISS: Justice Kennedy, if the agency\nhas exercised some selectivity in terms of what it's put\nin that reading room, we would argue that it is a\nreport. That's a far cry from what we have here, but\nthat's a much closer case.\nBut with respect to FOIA responses, the\nthird way in which information is disclosed by an agency\nunder FOIA, it is always in response to a specific FOIA\nrequest. The FOIA response constitutes the agency's\nofficial response to that request. It's subject to\nappeal, appeals -- even subject to appeal in the Federal\ncourts, and this Court itself has had -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know if the\nfiles are digitized or not, but if they want this\nparticular veteran's report, suppose you could just push\na button, and they all come out. Is -- is that a report\nwhen those veteran's documents are just put together in\na rubber band and shipped off?\nMR. REISS: It certainly is a report. A\nreport is any officially sanctioned notification.\nCommon understanding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't sound\nlike in normal parlance if you come to an agency and say\nI want these documents, and the person comes down and\nsays here they are, he's not going to say here's my\nreport. He's going to say here are the documents you\nasked for; this is our response.\nMR. REISS: Mr. Chief Justice, it is a\nreport in the following sense: The agency is saying,\none, we have these documents; two, these documents are\nthe very documents you're asking for. That is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's information,\nfacts, that you can glean from their action, but that\ndoesn't make what they've done a report.\nMR. REISS: Well, with all due respect,\nMr. Chief Justice, I think their response in handing\nover the documents, saying these are the documents, is a\nreport that we have these documents; here are the\ndocuments you've requested. Now, of course -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that means that if\nthey tell you go look for it on the Web site of X\nagency, then they are incorporating everything that that\nother agency has as part of their report?\nMR. REISS: Well, they are -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That it's not a response\nin telling you you've got to find what you're looking\nfor?\nMR. REISS: It is a report in the sense\nthey're reporting where to look for it. It is a far cry\nfrom the FOIA responses at issue in this case and most\nFOIA responses. In this case, there are three different\nFOIA responses at issue. The first two FOIA responses\nhave two important pieces to them. They say, one, for\ncertain years we couldn't find any of these VETS-100\nreports, we don't have them. We do have them for other\nyears.\nThose responses communicated key facts upon\nwhich Mr. Kirk based his qui tam complaint. He alleged\nthat in 6 of the years -- 6 of the 9 years at issue\nhere, his allegation is Schindler never filed these\nrequired VETS-100 reports. The communication by the\nDepartment of Labor, we don't have those reports in\nthose years, was the sole basis on which those\nallegations are made and is clearly a report. The\nreport is: We don't have those reports.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your position\nthat sometimes it can't -- a FOIA response can be a\nreport and other times it's not?\nMR. REISS: No, Mr. Chief Justice. Our\nposition is that every FOIA response is itself a\nreport -- many will require an investigation -- but\nevery FOIA response is itself a report within the\nordinary meaning of the word \"report,\" which is a\nnotification. There are news reports, there are weather\nreports, there are traffic reports. There are, as in\nthis case, VETS-100 reports. They are all reports.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there's no difference\nbetween a report -- the government has an investigating\ncommission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the\nmany government agencies that are just repositories?\nThey accept pieces of paper, reports, filed by other\npeople, like a tax return, like a financial disclosure.\nThe agency does nothing, has no input.\nI mean, there's surely different between\nthose two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural\nunderstanding would be it's a report by the person who's\nfiling it to the agency; and the other, where the agency\nputs personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of\nthe agency. And you seem to say, no, they're all\nreports of the agency.\nMR. REISS: Justice Ginsburg, let me be\nclear. If -- if the agency simply had an open-door\npolicy, just filed everything in a room and said in\nresponse to a FOIA request those documents are publicly\navailable, you can go in and search our files, figure\nout if those reports are there or not -- that agency\nresponse would not be a -- a report or investigation. A\nresponse that simply says do the search yourself -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take this very\ncase -\nMR. REISS: We may or may not have the\ndocument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you isn't\nthere a difference between saying we want the raw\nfilings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the\ngovernment to do any investigations, we want them to do\njust the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and\nan agency saying we're going to investigate and make a\nreport, we're going to put our people under the\ninvestigators, and we're going to interview witnesses,\nthey're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll\nmake a report?\nThat's how I understand a government report.\nBut it's very hard for me to understand how a report by\nSchindler becomes a government report simply because it\nis filed with the agency.\nMR. REISS: Justice Ginsburg, we think that\nreports and investigations can certainly vary\ndrastically in degree and kind. An antitrust\ninvestigation may require millions and millions of\ndocuments and take the Justice Department 4 years.\nOn the other hand, if the Department of\nLabor itself had decided to determine or to investigate\nwhether Schindler itself had filed these VETS-100\nreports, it would have done exactly what it did in\nresponse to Mr. Kirk's FOIA request. It would have -\nit went to -- his request started out with the\nDepartment of Labor Office of Information.\nIt was sent to the Division on Investigation\nand Compliance, located in a completely separate\nbuilding. The response to his request was delivered by\nMr. Robert Wilson, who is the chief of the\nInvestigations and Compliance Division. His activity\nclearly constitutes an investigation, and the results\nthat he gives to Mr. Kirk is clearly a report.\nThere may be many other agency activities\nthat are far more detailed, far more complex, but it\ndoesn't make what is done in response to a FOIA request\nnot a report or investigation. They are still reports\nand investigations within the ordinary meaning of those\nwords.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But is the question whether\nthe documents that are turned over themselves reports or\nwhether they are included in a report? I thought what\n(e)(4) said was that you -- you determine whether it is\nin a congressional administrative or accounting office\nreport.\nSo that, suppose the Department of Labor\nissued what everybody would concede is a report and\nappended to that certain documents, wouldn't those\ndocuments be in the report, even though they are not the\nreport themselves?\nMR. REISS: Absolutely, Justice Alito.\nWhen -- when a FOIA response says, as it did in this\ncase, we didn't -- say it says we didn't find certain\ndocuments; we did find certain documents. Here are the\ndocuments we found. The attachment of the documents\nthat's found is part of the report, but the report is -\nis a complete report. We didn't find some things; we\nfound these things, here are the things we found; they\nmeet the description of what you asked for. The\ndocuments being attached are clearly part of the report.\nNow, we think that the position taken by the\nGovernment and the Respondent also creates fairly\nserious dislocations. Under the definition of \"report\"\nadvanced by Mr. Kirk and the Government, many things\nthat are actually called reports by statute are not\nreports.\nThe Department of Labor's -- Department of\nLabor reports that it is required to file detailing its\noversight and compliance of VEVRRA, the statute at issue\nhere, is called a report under section 1354. The -- the\nreport that every agency must file under the Freedom of\nInformation Act detailing their activities and their\ncompliance with FOIA, itself called a report under the\nFreedom of Information Act, that is not a report under\nthe definition advanced by the Government and Kirk,\nbecause they require some element that appears nowhere\nin the public disclosure bar. They require an element\nof some kind of search for wrongdoing or fraud. That\ndefinition appears nowhere in the public disclosure bar.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We'll find out from them\nif that is what they have set their position. I had not\nread them to say that. I read them to say only -- to\nchallenge your position that every FOIA response is\nnecessarily a report for purposes of the False Claims\nAct.\nMR. REISS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but their\nresponse is that certain FOIA responses will constitute\na report or investigation, depending on the underlying\ndocuments that are disclosed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you request a report,\nthen you get a report.\nMR. REISS: But -- but their -- their test\nfor the underlying documents is effectively the\nresurrection of their on-the-trail notion that this\nCourt rejected only last term in the Graham County case.\nThey infused that requirement, the report requirement,\nwith this notion that the government has to be looking\nfor something wrong. And if the report that is\ndisclosed along with, as Justice Alito points out, the\nFOIA response is a report that indicates the government\nwas looking for something wrong, well, that's a report.\nIf it doesn't indicate that, it doesn't qualify as a\nreport.\nWe think that crabbed definition of report\nis not the ordinary definition of report, and this Court\nhas said innumerable times, including I've heard even\ntoday that the Court looks to the ordinary, regular\nmeaning of terms. The ordinary meaning of \"report\"\nclearly encompasses every FOIA response.\nIf there are no further questions, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I would reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Willens.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. WILLENS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WILLENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSchindler is asking the Court to construe\n\"administrative report\" far too broadly. In its view,\nthe public disclosure bar would apply to all FOIA\ndocuments, regardless of their content. It would also\napply to nearly all other documents created or disclosed\nby the government. This construction of the bar would\nseriously undermine the operation of the False Claims\nAct.\nCongress amended the Act in 1986 to\nencourage whistleblowers specifically to use government\nrecords in their investigations. This Court recognized\nthat objective in the Hughes Aircraft case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Most of the -- maybe\nI'm -- maybe this isn't correct, but many FOIA responses\ninclude more than just turning over the documents.\nThey've got a privilege log or other things, this\nexemption applies, here's a document, but these things\nare blacked out, and they tell you why. Is that a\nreport?\nMR. WILLENS: No, Your Honor. If it's a\nFOIA response, it's not a report. The -- the documents\nhere are very, very typical of a low-level FOIA\nresponse, and the -- this Court, of course, gets more\ncomplicated FOIA cases with our First Amendment issues\nand national security issues, but this is a very, very\nstandard FOIA response. And the letter, which is in the\nrecord, is a very typical FOIA response. It's a form\nletter with three paragraphs: We got your request;\nhere's what we found, you can appeal if you want to.\nThey're all the same.\nSo for this purpose, it's useful just to\nlook at this one. That -- there's always a possibility\nthat a FOIA officer will uncover something else, a sign\nof wrongdoing, for example; but that -- at that point,\nit becomes not a FOIA case anymore, not a FOIA process\nanymore. FOIA is very limited to just the finding and\nreleasing of documents. And for that reason, we -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's not\nreally because it does get into the assertion of\nexemptions and privileges, and -\nMR. WILLENS: That's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- things of that\nsort. And why isn't that a report of somebody's\nevaluation of the particular documents that are being\nreleased?\nMR. WILLENS: The -- all the work that Your\nHonor described goes into whether or not that document\nshould be released; and under the False Claims Act test\nthe release of documents is only the first test in the\nfive-part public disclosure bar test. It -- FOIA just\nmoves the -- the document from the government files into\nthe public and satisfies the first prong of the test.\nBut the Second Circuit said that the second part of the\ntest requires an examination of the individual documents\nthat are being released.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could we talk about\nthe test that you propose? You say that a report is a\nusually formal account of the results of an\ninvestigation given by a group or person authorized to\nmake it, right?\nMR. WILLENS: That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And then an investigation is\nmost reasonably understood as an official probe into\nfraudulent conduct.\nMR. WILLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the report does not\ninvestigate fraudulent conduct, then it isn't -- if\nsomething does not involve information about fraudulent\nconduct, it's not a report?\nMR. WILLENS: We -- we wouldn't take that\nhard a line, Your Honor. The -- the material you're\nquoting comes out of the dictionary, and we were looking\nfor a good -- it's based on dictionary definitions, I\nmean. We were looking for a good, reasonable definition\nto come out of Webster's Dictionary. We're asking the\nCourt to adopt the Second Circuit's definition, which is\nbroader and doesn't have an explicit requirement of\ninvestigation into fraud. And we certainly aren't\nasking the Court to rule that all the standard\nadministrative reports that agencies issue all the time\nare not reports.\nBut it's very useful in a close case where\nthe document doesn't say this is the administrative\nreport or the report of staff on a particular issue -\nit's very helpful in a close case to look at the context\nof the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I ask you about\na document to which your adversary referred? The\nDepartment of Justice and all of the other departments\nare required annually to issue what are termed Freedom\nof Information Act reports. Now, is that a report -\nMR. WILLENS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- under the False Claims\nAct?\nMR. WILLENS: Yes, it is, Your Honor, and\nwe've argued that because the FOIA uses the word\n\"response\" for the documents we're talking about today\nand uses the word \"report\" for that document that goes\nto Congress, it must have understood those words to mean\ndifferent things.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But this report is -\ndoesn't seem to involve a process that's any less\nmechanical than responding to a FOIA report. It's\nbasically a compilation of statistics: how many\nrequests were filed, how long it took to process them,\nexemptions that were claimed, and so forth. So what's\nthe difference?\nMR. WILLENS: Well, FOIA is a special case,\nYour Honor; that's the first difference. It only looks\ninto whether or not documents should move from\ngovernment files into the public, and we're suggesting\nthat because there's such a strong government purpose in\nencouraging whistleblowers to bring those documents out,\nthat in order to give meaning to the list of enumerated\nsources here you have to look at what the documents are\nthere, that are coming out.\nYou can look at this FOIA cover letter, and\nI think you'll see that it doesn't have any substantive\ncontent to it. It just refers to the investigation, or\nit refers to the FOIA search that was -- that took place\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -\nMR. WILLENS: In a lot of ways -- sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give us -- give us your\ndefinition. You say you're not standing by the\ndictionary definition -\nMR. WILLENS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that was read. You're\n-- what is your definition? It's not just reports of\ninvestigations into fraud. What else is it?\nMR. WILLENS: On the investigation side,\nit's a definition -- the definition is a focused and\nsustained inquiry toward a government end, a substantive\ngovernment end that would have to do with the policies\nand practices of the -- of the agency; that is,\nuncovering noncompliance or assembling information about\na policy program or something like that. We're trying\nto distinguish that from -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any -- any\ndictionary that gives that definition? I mean, the\nadvantage of -- of the Petitioners' is they use a -- a\ndictionary definition. It may be a very broad one and\nyou don't like it for that reason, but it is the way the\nword is sometimes used.\nMR. WILLENS: It is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know any dictionary\nthat would define the word the way you say it.\nMR. WILLENS: That's the Second Circuit's\nholding, Your Honor. That's exactly why we spent a\nlarge part of our brief explaining why there's a better\ndictionary definition than the one that Petitioner uses.\nOne important difference -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is -- can you point\nus to the page so we can see the Second Circuit's\ndefinition of report and the Second Circuit's definition\nof an FCA investigation?\nMR. WILLENS: I'm not sure that I can do\nthat, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't -- I don't\nwant to eat into your time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I understood the\ndefinition that I read to be the position that you are\nadvocating, not simply some dictionary -- some\ndefinition that happens to appear in the dictionary. I\nunderstood that to be the test that you were saying we\nshould adopt. Am I wrong? Did I misread your brief?\nMR. WILLENS: We -- we believe that that's a\ngood definition that could be used, Your Honor, but the\ntrouble is that there's not going to be any dictionary\ndefinition that covers all the innumerable ways that\n\"administrative report\" can be used. And I wanted to\njust -- to answer your earlier question to say that, of\ncourse, there are standard administrative reports that\nagencies issue. The -- the courts below have been\nresolving this kind of issue outside the FOIA context\nfor 25 years since this statute was passed without any\nserious trouble.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if we adopt your\ndefinition, isn't it true that a lot of things that are\nlabeled Department of Labor report, Justice Department\nFreedom of Information Act report, are not reports?\nMR. WILLENS: Yes, Your Honor, and that's\nwhy I told you that the Second Circuit's definition, if\nyou're looking for an overarching definition, is a\nbetter one. The trouble there -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you're withdrawing from\nthe definition that you proposed in your brief?\nMR. WILLENS: I -- I believe they are both\nhelpful, Your Honor, and I also believe that the -- the\nSecond Circuit's definition covers all of these kinds of\nreports, but there's no need for this Court to issue its\nown definition. There's another way of resolving this\ncase, which is simply to answer the question of whether\nFOIA responses, which are unique in many respects, and\nhave their own statutory and regulatory structure, are\nadministrative reports or investigations on their own\nterms. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we have to say why?\nDon't we have to say why they are they are that?\nMR. WILLENS: Of course, you have -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And once we have to say\nwhy, we're -- we're getting into the need for defining\nwhat a report is.\nMR. WILLENS: Well, I -- it would be\npossible -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't usually just say\nyes, no; you know, we usually give reasons.\nMR. WILLENS: I agree with that, Your Honor,\nbut point two of our brief is an explanation of why it\nmakes sense not to have a categorical rule that every\nFOIA response and all of its attachments are always\nadministrative reports and investigations. And I submit\nyou don't have to, to find administrative report an\ninvestigation for all purposes in order just to answer\nthat narrow question.\nFor example, the word \"investigation\" is\nused in the False Claims Act for a very specific kind of\ninvestigation: a law enforcement investigation. And a\nFOIA search, which is defined in that statute as a\nreview, is not an investigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk about the\npurpose of the statute. Surely, that should bear upon\nhow you read the -- what you read the words to mean. I\nhad thought that the purpose was as -- as Petitioner's\ncounsel said, the purpose was to allow people to bring\nqui tam actions who have their own information and who\nare not just relying on information that they -- that is\nnot personal to them. Is that accurate or not?\nMR. WILLENS: No, Your Honor. The -- the\nstatute has always encouraged both insiders and people\nwho are dealing with secondhand information, what we\nused to call private attorney generals, to go out and do\ntheir own investigation. And Congress amended the\nstatute in 1986 to encourage those people and insiders\nlike Mr. Kirk to get documents out of the government\nfiles that they need as evidence to support their case.\nThe case doesn't lack merit simply because\nthe whistleblower needs additional evidence to prove his\ncase in court, and FOIA is a critical aspect of that\nbecause relators frequently don't have one piece of\ninformation, which is what their corporation said to\ngovernment contracting officers. That is, Mr. Kirk, for\nexample, knows operationally -- he knows that every\ncontract Schindler had for 15 years was breached because\nthey were not following the key contractual provision to\nabide by the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He only knows that because\nof the FOIA response.\nMR. WILLENS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because -- because the\nagency said we don't have any reports for those 5 years.\nWhy isn't that information from the agency a report by\nthe agency that we don't have any documents from those 5\nyears, and, therefore, your client says they didn't file\ndocuments for those 5 years?\nMR. WILLENS: There were a few statements\nwrapped up in that -- in that question, Your Honor. But\nthe point I'm trying to make is that Mr. Kirk has a vast\namount of inside knowledge about this breach of contract\nthat was going on for so many years, and it's different\nfrom the notification requirement. That's what triggers\nthe False Claims Act liability.\nBut it's different from saying that there\nwas a fraudulent scheme going on for 10 or 15 years that\ndamaged the government, damaged the veterans employed by\nthe company, and -- and undermined the whole purpose of\nVEVRRA that requires it to be in these contracts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the -- I think\nyou've just divided up two issues. The first is, the\nFOIA letter does tell you that there weren't reports for\ncertain years.\nMR. WILLENS: It said -- the word is that\nreports were not found.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Found. Now, the issue\nis different from whether the ones that were found were\nfalse or not; is that correct?\nMR. WILLENS: That's true, and I would say\nit's also different from the issue of whether they were\nfiled, because the fact that the agency didn't find them\nduring a cursory review of its records, which is -- a\nreasonable review of the records is all it's required to\ndo. In a compliance investigation, of course, they\nwould go on much further. They would look to see if the\ndocuments were filed somewhere else. If they -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your client would\nsearch if they weren't filed, and on the basis of no\nother information except this FOIA response.\nMR. WILLENS: It's not no other information,\nYour Honor. It's a pattern of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How else does your client\nknow that there were no reports filed for these years,\nwhich is part of the -- part of the claim here?\nMR. WILLENS: He knows that Schindler did\nnot collect the information that it would have needed in\norder to file accurate reports.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He wasn't there during\nthose years, was he?\nMR. WILLENS: He was only not there during\nthe very tail end of our period, which runs from 1999 to\n2005. He was there and he was fired or let go in the\nmiddle of 2003, so he has personal knowledge of all of\nthat failure to collect the information. The question,\nthen, is whether Schindler filed false reports or failed\nto file them at all, and he alleged, without reference\nto the FOIA response, that it had to be one or the\nother. And either way, it's going to be a violation,\nand that's sufficient at this stage of the case.\nWe're the 12(b)(1) motion, Your Honor. I\nhaven't had an opportunity for discovery and we don't\nknow anything else about Schindler's conduct, but\nit's -- it's not correct to say that -- well, I think\nI've answered the question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, may I ask you why a\nFOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test?\nAn investigation, the Court says, quote, \"implies a more\nfocused and sustained inquiry toward a government end.\"\nNow, the government end in responding to a\nFOIA request is compliance with FOIA, and somebody has\nto search for these records and determine whether any\nexemptions apply, and that would seem to be focused and\nsustained. So what element is missing?\nMR. WILLENS: The -- there's a missing\ngovernment end here because all that's happening is the\ntransmission of documents from inside the agency to the\noutside the agency.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's the way the\nSecond Circuit defined its own, or limited its own\ndefinition. But why isn't it -- why isn't the Ninth\nCircuit incorrect -- pardon me, the Second Circuit\nincorrect when it says that this is not a governmental\nend? It is a governmental end.\nMR. WILLENS: Obviously, satisfying the\nrequirements of FOIA and its regulations is a government\nend to that extent, but the Second Circuit was trying to\ndistinguish between the substantive work of an agency\nand the more ministerial but still important act of\ntaking documents out of files and sending them out to\nthe public. A FOIA officer is -- is separate and apart\nin most cases from other programmatic officers in an\nagency, because we want to keep that act of taking\ndocuments out of the files and making them public\nseparate from people who might not want those documents\nto go out into the files into the public.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person is -- the\nperson is separate but is often dealing on a regular\nbasis with people who have line responsibilities and\nsomething else.\nMR. WILLENS: Of course.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He sees something -\nwell, that looks like it might be a problem -- he gets\non the phone or goes down there and says: Is this\ncovered by the exemption or not?\nMR. WILLENS: Of course. I didn't mean to\nsay that they don't speak to them. It's just that\nthere's a different line of authority in most cases, and\nit's a different kind of mission. So I -- I hear the\nquestion, and I understand the problem, but at some\npoint you need to distinguish between what FOIA's trying\nto do, which is to make documents public, and what the\ngovernment agency's work is, which is to implement its\npolicies, procedures, sign contracts, build roads and\nwhatever else it does.\nThere's such a strong government purpose in\ngetting these documents out to the public, and\nspecifically in this case to relators and whistleblowers\nthat this Court has held, 15 -- has held, almost 15\nyears ago, that that is why Congress amended the statute\nin 1986, and to tell the Congress now 25 years later\nthat they made a mistake when they used the word\n\"administrative report\" and they accidentally covered a\nvast number of documents, they could have used the word\n\"agency records,\" which they used in FOIA to cover\neverything. But instead, Congress chose a very narrow\nset of enumerated sources, specifically so that other\ndocuments would be available to relators.\nAs I tried to say before, getting those FOIA\ndocuments out to a relator is particularly important,\nbecause it has the correspondence between Schindler or\nother contractor and the government.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you determine which\ngovernment ends count and which government ends don't\ncount?\nMR. WILLENS: My only argument is that FOIA\nis a different kind of mission.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's the only\ngovernment -- compliance with FOIA is the only\ngovernment end that doesn't count?\nMR. WILLENS: I believe FOIA is a special\ncase, Your Honor, and there are many reasons why that -\nthat would be the case. We've argued that the -- the\nplain language of FOIA indicates that a response is not\na report; a search is not an investigation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So a report that goes to a\ndepartment or agency's compliance with some law that is\nnot directly related to the mission of that department,\nthat would qualify as a -- as a government end for these\npurposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count?\nMR. WILLENS: FOIA is the only thing that -\nthat doesn't count. It's like a publishing house or a\nlittle clearing house inside each agency whose job is to\ntake manuscripts, or in this case, reports or audits or\nhearings or whatever, and take them out into the public.\nI think it's fair to distinguish between that function,\nthe publication function, and the substantive work of\nthe agency. If you don't do that, then you're heading\ndown a slippery slope which Schindler eloquently\narticulated in its reply brief. You end up at a point\nwhere not only FOIA documents are covered, but non-FOIA\ndocuments, in one case, even SEC filings, private SEC\nfilings that are automatically posted to the\ncommission's computer, Schindler seems to think that\nthose are administrative reports.\nAnd you've, of course, transformed every\nprivate document, like these VETS-100 reports, into\npublic documents simply by the process of corporate\nfiling and then release by the government. There's\nsimply no basis for that in the statute, and it would\ncause enormous harm to the operation of the statute.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Sherry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMS. SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI want to start with one thing that hasn't\nyet been brought up this morning, and that is the\ncontext. We are not talking about words in isolation.\nWe're not talking about the abstract meaning of the word\n\"report.\" What we're talking about is public\ndisclosures of allegations or transactions in a\ncongressional, administrative, or GAO report hearing,\naudit or investigation. And in that context, the word,\nthe phrase \"administrative report,\" the phrase\n\"administrative investigation,\" has some meaning.\nWhen you speak of a congressional\ninvestigation, when you speak of a GAO report, and when\nyou speak of an administrative audit, that conjures up a\ncertain image that goes beyond the simple search for\nresponsive records in response to a -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your test, am I right -\nthis is page 21 of your brief -- that it has to go to\nthe uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquiring\ninto wrongdoing. Is that your test?\nMS. SHERRY: I don't think it has to go just\nto the inquiring into wrongdoing. I think the way to\nthink about it is whether or not the agency or the\ngovernmental entity is engaging in a substantive inquiry\ninto and a substantive analysis of information of data,\nof facts, and that's the distinction between what an\nagency does in response to FOIA.\nFOIA is a means of public disclosure. It's\na method by which an agency grants the public access to\npreexisting records that are in its possession. It is\nessentially the public disclosure component of the\npublic disclosure bar -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the test whether -\nthe test is whether there's a substantive analysis of\nfacts?\nMS. SHERRY: There's a substantive analysis\nof the facts. For example, in the FOIA context, while\nthe agency is certainly pulling responsive records and\nis engaging in some sort of inquiry into whether\nexemptions apply and whether the information can be\nreleased or should be released, it's not looking at the\ndata. It's not looking at the information that's in\nthat document for its substantive content.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So -- but when the -- when\nthe DOJ pulls together at the end of the fiscal year the\nnumber of FOIA requests that it received and calculates\nthe length of time they were pending and discloses that\nin the annual freedom of act -- Freedom of Information\nAct report, that is a report?\nMS. SHERRY: I think that would be a report\nunder our definition because the Department of Justice\nis actually engaging with the data, engaging in the\nanalysis. And if I'm remembering correctly, I think it\nalso requires, for example, the Attorney General to\nreport on how it's encouraging compliance with FOIA by\nthe different agencies.\nAnd so I think in most of the circumstances\nthat it would still qualify as a report, and I think\nFOIA is quite distinct from that.\nAnd if you look at the facts of this case in\nparticular, it demonstrates what the substance of the\nagency's action is in a FOIA case. It's -- again, it's\na means of public disclosure. Congress could have\nenacted a very different public disclosure bar. In 1943\nto 1986, there was what was called the government\nknowledge bar.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Every report is a mean -\nmeans of public disclosure. Does -- the Freedom of\nInformation Act report is a means of public disclosure,\nthat's the reason that Congress required it.\nMS. SHERRY: That's -- that's certainly\ntrue, but the public disclosure bar requires more than\njust the public disclosure. Congress made the extra\neffort and included only particular enumerated\ngovernmental sources. Whatever the line is, we know\nthat it cannot be any dissemination of information from\na governmental entity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I'm -- I'm still\nstruggling to find out what the definition is of -- of a\nreport or an investigation. You say it's a substantive\nanalysis of facts. Does not the person who processes a\nFOIA request have to engage in a substantive analysis of\nfacts to determine whether particular documents fall\nwithin the scope of the request, whether certain\nmaterials are covered by exemptions?\nMS. SHERRY: I don't think the -- two\nanswers to that question. One is I don't think the\nofficer engaging in any substantive analysis of the\nfacts that are in the records that it's disclosing, but\nthe second answer to that question is if that's all\nthat's required, then I think we're back to a position\nwhere every disclosure of information by the government\nwould qualify as a public disclosure.\nAnd we not -- we know that's not the choice\nthat Congress made. It included only specifically\nenumerated sources, and it chose particular words. It\nchose report, hearing, audit or investigation. It is\nhard to think of what other words Congress could have\nused to describe the type of report we are talking about\nor the type of investigation besides those words.\nIf Congress had wanted to have a broader\nmeaning, it had a number of other types of words at its\ndisposal. It could have said document, it could have\nsaid communication, it could have said record, and then\nit would map quite well on to what FOIA is, which is the\npublic disclosure of agency records. It didn't do any\nof that, and so I think we have to give some credence to\nthe choice of words and to the fact that Congress -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what -- why -- imagine\neverything here is the same. That is, what I imagine\nhappened here is that an individual wrote and asked for\na FOIA request. Did Schindler Elevator file a certain\nkind of statement. And you say that's not a report.\nNow, imagine everything the same except the\nperson who asks is called Joe Smith, fraud officer for\nthe agency. Everything else is the same. Now is it a\nreport?\nMS. SHERRY: No, and -- I'm sorry. The\nsecond circumstance it is, but let me -- I answered that\nincorrectly. The second circumstance it would be, but\nlet me explain the distinction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't understand the\ncircumstance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is exactly what\nhappened here.\nMS. SHERRY: Let me -- that is not -- that's\nwhat I want to explain, that's not -- that's not what\nhappened here. If I submitted a FOIA request and said\ndid so-and-so company file a report, I wouldn't get a\nresponse, that's not a proper FOIA request.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it says, please\ntell me any documents that they filed that says da, da,\nda, something like that, okay? Now, we have the same\nthing, word for word, except the person who makes the\nrequest is not Mrs. Mary Jones from the public, the\nperson who makes the request is the fraud officer for\nthe agency that's worried about being defrauded. And\nall I'm interested in is, are they both not reports? Is\none a report and not the other? Or are they both\nreports?\nMS. SHERRY: The second one would be a\nreport if there was an investigation going on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just telling you the\nfacts. The facts are just what I said.\nMS. SHERRY: If -- if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Everything the same except\nhe signs his name, \"fraud officer.\"\nMS. SHERRY: Then -- then I misunderstood\nthe hypothetical. No, it doesn't matter who signing the\npiece of paper. What matters is the substance of the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, then, if a\nperson who is an outside person gets a hold of two\ndocuments, one, the request, and two the response, which\nis to say, yes, I found 15 reports, they're all signed\nby Mickey Mouse, okay? And he bases a complaint, there\nis no such person as Mickey Mouse, it's a fraud, okay?\nThen you go right ahead and bring the qui tam because it\nwasn't falling within the exception.\nIs that right, in the Government's view?\nMS. SHERRY: In the Government's view the\nfact that the information was obtained through a FOIA\nrequest doesn't answer the question as to whether the\nunderlying document is an administrative report or an\nadministrative audit or anything else of the sort. The\nFOIA -- the agency's response to a FOIA request, again,\nis nothing more than the first -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, you're repeating --\nI'm trying to show you what the problem is in my mind.\nI -- I can't quite work out the right definition, and\nthat's what I'm trying to get enlightened on.\nMS. SHERRY: And -- and the definition -\nand -- and I would be the first to acknowledge that\nthere may be difficult questions at the margin.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not trying to make a\ndifficult question. All I want is your enlightenment\nabout how when I write these two cases down, should I\ndistinguish them? Should I say they're both the same or\nwhat?\nMS. SHERRY: I think based on your\nhypothetical in both circumstances, all that is done is\nthe agency has looked in its files to see if it has\nresponsive records and disclose them, then in both\ncircumstances that's not a report and there was no -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say in most. In my\ncircumstance -\nMS. SHERRY: Oh, sorry. In both\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In both circumstances.\nMS. SHERRY: Then it's not -- it's not a\nreport and there's been no investigation. And I think\nwords have meaning, and it's significant that FOIA does\nnot refer to what an agency does as an investigation.\nIt refers to it as a reasonable search for responsive\nrecords, and this Court has never referred to it as an\ninvestigation, no court ever has. And that's because\nthere's a substantive distinction between an\ninvestigation, certainly between a GAO investigation,\nbetween a congressional investigation and what an agency\ndoes in response to a FOIA request.\nTo give an example, the GAO is not subject\nto FOIA, but it does in its regulation respond to\nrequests from the public much the same way that an\nagency does in response to a FOIA request. I think it\nwould be a rather strange use of the language to think\nof that as a GAO investigation and to think of the\nresponse as a GAO report.\nAnother example, and again, we're talking\nabout ordinary usage, not any possible usage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't want to\nhave to play these games every time there's -\nthere's -- there's one of these qui tam actions. I\nmean, the advantage of Petitioner's solution is that\nit -- it's easy -- it's easy to apply. I don't find\nyours easy to apply at all.\nMS. SHERRY: It may be easy to apply, but\nit's easy to apply and it reads out an entire subset\nenumerated sources that Congress thought important to\ninclude.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the FCA, the\namendments in 2009, which are not retroactive, do they\nhave any bearing on this problem prospectively?\nMS. SHERRY: On a prospective -- not -- not\ndirectly in that the words \"report,\" \"hearing,\" \"audit\"\nor \"investigation\" are still included, but it did\nnarrowly and further define what that means. It added a\nFederal context, and so this Court had decided in Graham\nCounty that there was no Federal nexus required for the\nsecond category of documents and going forward with the\n2010 amendments there now is.\nAnd so, on a prospective basis -- may I\nfinish? On a prospective basis, State audits, State\nreports would not be subject -- would not bar a qui tam\ncase, unless if this Court holds otherwise they're\nproduced in response to a FOIA request.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Reiss, you have 14 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REISS: I don't think I'll use it all,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Ginsburg, in response to your\nrequest, the new version of the False Claims Act lets\nthe government disclaim the public disclosure bar. It\nnow says the bar can apply unless opposed by the\ngovernment. So the government has an automatic ability\nto stop the imposition of the public disclosure bar\nsimply by opposing it. So that is a material change in\nthe government's favor that the new False Claims Act has\nmade.\nLet me just address an underlying premise\nthat we've heard, I think, somewhat repeatedly from the\nGovernment and Mr. Kirk, and that is this notion that\nFOIA is simply an automatic process, that agencies are a\npublishing house or clearinghouses. That notion is\nutterly belied by the statute and the process itself,\nand it's utterly belied by the statistics from the\nDepartment of Labor in terms of what their responses are\nand how they do them.\nIn 2008, which was the last year we were\nable to find statistics for, the Department of Labor,\nthe department at issue here, processed 17,000 FOIA\nresponses. Only 28 percent were granted in full.\nThirty-two percent were denied in full, 10 percent,\nbased on the statutory exemptions, and 22 percent based\non other statutes like the Privacy Act, and 40 percent\nof those 17,000 responses were partial responses. So we\ncan give you some but not all; and in fact the FOIA\nresponses in this very case not only reported that we\nfound some of the VETS-100 reports in some years, we\ndidn't find them in others; but with respect to the\nVETS-100 reports that were attached, they actually made\nredactions, because those redactions were compelled\naccording to the Chief of Compliance and Investigations\nby the Privacy Act.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Reiss, assuming that\nthe government did all of the steps you took, how does\nit promote the purposes of FOIA -\nMR. REISS: Very -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to find a document\ncreated by a third party, under duty or not, that is\nsubmitted and contains false statements. How does it\npromote the government's interests to bar an individual\nwho has personal knowledge about the falsity from being\na qui tam action?\nMR. REISS: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that seem\nillogical, meaning the -- the report filed by the\nemployer is not screaming out, \"I filed a false report.\"\nYou need some outside knowledge from that statement by\nthe employer to prove the falsity. So how is your rule\npromoting FOIA's purposes?\nMR. REISS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, in that\nhypothetical the relator actually is bringing\nindependent information, and the public disclosure bar\nwould not be invoked -- not because the FOIA response\nisn't a report; it wouldn't be invoked because the\nallegations and transactions in the qui tam complaint\nwere not based on; they were not disclosed in the FOIA\nresponse.\nIt furthers the purpose of the statute, our\ninterpretation furthers the purpose of the statute\nbecause the purpose of the public disclosure bar was to\nstop qui tam suits from being brought by members of the\npublic based on information equally accessible to anyone\nin the public.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still not sure I\nunderstand. Here the relator is saying, the statement\nsays we complied with the military act, and he says they\ndidn't. I have personal information they didn't because\nI know they didn't do X, Y, and Z. Why did we even\nreach the questions we did if what he's claiming is that\nhe was an original -- that he has original knowledge not\n-- not reflected in the reports?\nMR. REISS: And what I'm saying, Justice\nSotomayor is if that's the case, a court can evaluate -\ncertainly can evaluate whether he is in fact the\noriginal source, which would take him out from under the\npublic disclosure bar. The court below, the district\ncourt did that, and found that he wasn't. Or even\nbefore reaching that inquiry, if a relator can say my\nqui tam complaint is not based upon the public\ndisclosure of allegations and transactions and reports,\nthe bar doesn't drop.\nOur position is the appropriate place for\nthe inquiry that you're worried about is in determining\nwhether there is a disclosure of the relator's\nallegations or transactions. Whether -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I still don't understand\nhow it promotes the purposes of a qui tam action -\nMR. REISS: Because of -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to put any kind of\nbar on a relator who is challenging the creation of a\ndocument that's submitted by an independent party to the\ngovernment.\nMR. REISS: Well, one of the purposes of the\npublic disclosure bar was to stop -- and this Court\nrecognized it in Graham County -- parasitic lawsuits by\nrelators with no real significant independent or\nvaluable information to contribute. What we're\nsuggesting, as I understand the question -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In fact that's not true.\nWe have -- that -- because the Government's right;\nCongress changed the -- the law from anything that was\nin the government's possession and narrowed the scope of\nthe bar.\nMR. REISS: Exactly, Justice Sotomayor, but\nour position does not resurrect the government knowledge\nstandard that Congress changed in 1986, and it doesn't\ndo so for some very good reasons. First of all, the\ngovernment -- the government knowledge standard that the\nCourt -- that the Congress changed in 1986 didn't allow\na relator who is actually the original source of the\ninformation to bring suit. That was one of the major\nthings that prompted the congressional change in 1986.\nSecondly, and it's clear from the\nlegislative history in the Senate report, one of the\nprimary concerns of Congress in enacting the statute in\n1986 was the fact that there was a sense that government\nemployees themselves who were knowledgeable about\npotential contracting fraud were not coming forward. In\nfact, the Senate report cites a 1983 survey in which 73\npercent of 5,000 government employees responded they\nwould not come forward with evidence of contractor\nfraud. That was a major concern with Congress under the\nold government knowledge standard, the pre-1986\ngovernment knowledge standard. Those -- if those\nemployees came forward, the suit would still be barred\nbecause the government by definition would have known\nabout the fraud.\nUnder the new statute, not only do you have\nthe original source exception, but if government\nemployees come forward, they are not barred from\nbringing those qui tam suits. It's a major change and\nit's not the resurrection, Justice Sotomayor, of the\ngovernment knowledge standard.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
