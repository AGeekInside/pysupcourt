        "content": "(10:56 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 05-1575, Schriro versus Landrigan.\nMr. Cattani.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT E. CATTANI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CATTANI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit's rejection of a reasoned\nState court factual determination and decision is\nimproper under any deferential standard of review, and\nit is particularly improper under the highly deferential\nstandard of review required under the AEDPA. This\nmorning I'd like to try to develop three -- three\npoints.\nFirst, the State court's factual finding\nthat Landrigan instructed his attorney not to present\nany mitigating evidence was not an unreasonable finding\nand, in fact, is the most logical interpretation of the\nrecord. Although Landrigan now argues that the record\ndoes not show whether his decision not to present\nmitigation evidence was knowing or voluntary, that is\nnot a claim that was ever developed in State court. He\nnever alleged in his State post-conviction proceedings\nthat that, his decision to do that was not knowing or\nvoluntary.\nSecondly, an evidentiary hearing is\nunwarranted in this case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask about the first\none? Does the Constitution require there be no\ninvoluntary?\nMR. CATTANI: It would require that it would\nbe knowing and voluntary, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if the record showed\nthat he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to\nvoluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't\nthe district court be able to reexamine that?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, there's no colloquy\nrequirement for a defendant to waive presentation of\nmitigation. And I think it would have been enough if\nthe defendant or defense counsel had simply said my --\nif the attorney had said my client has instructed me not\nto present any mitigating evidence, and that would be\nadequate. If a defendant chooses to make a claim that\nhis waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden\nwould shift to him to do that in a post-conviction\nproceeding, and he did not do that in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How would he make such a\nclaim in this case where in open court he was asked by\nthe judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether\nit was the case that he did not want any mitigating\nevidence introduced? And he said, right, yes, that's\ncorrect?\nMR. CATTANI: I agree, Your Honor. It would\nbe very difficult for him to make that argument and I\nsuspect that's why the argument was not raised in the\nState post-conviction proceeding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know if you\ngot to the third point you were going to make. You were\noutlining three different points. But it seems to me\nthat from the very start, what happens is that you and\nyour brother for the respondent are talking past each\nother. You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the\nState court's finding. The respondent says what we --\nall we want is a hearing in the district court, and\nthose are two different issues.\nWe want a hearing in the district court,\ni.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial\nor incorrect. Those, it seems to me, are two different\nissues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each\nother on this point.\nDid you see the same thing?\nMR. CATTANI: Yes, I did, Your Honor, and I\nthink the reason for that is, in our view an evidentiary\nhearing is not necessary because the factual finding by\nthe State court obviates the need for one. An\nevidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that\nwould never have been presented. Given this factual\nfinding, the State court is in effect saying no matter\nwhat counsel might or might not have developed, it would\nnot have been presented at sentencing because this\ndefendant specifically instructed his attorney not to\npresent any mitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your view, what is the\nstandard for when the district court may hold an\nevidentiary hearing? I know there's an element of\ndiscretion in it.\nMR. CATTANI: A district -- the district\ncourt can order an evidentiary hearing if the defendant\nhas been denied an opportunity to develop relevant facts\nnecessary to resolve a colorable claim in State court.\nAnd I think here the defendant fails on two different\npoints.\nFirst --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the only time the\ndistrict court can hold a hearing?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, it has to be through no\nfault of his own and if the facts were not developed in\nState court. Certainly it's the petitioner's\nobligation, a defendant's obligation to present these\nclaims in State court and the only -- the reason --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but it seems that if\nhe doesn't do that, then that's a bar. But if he has\ndone that, when can he ask for a further hearing?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, but that's the point\nhere. He has not done that. He did not attempt to\ndevelop facts or he was not precluded from developing\nfacts that would be relevant to a resolution of his\nineffective assistance claim.\nIf I could, Your Honor, there are two\ndifferent parts of that question. First, the facts are\nnot relevant. The facts that he's seeking to develop in\nan evidentiary hearing is this additional, this\nmitigation that should have been developed. If, in\nfact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to\nbe presented is accurate, then these other facts are not\nrelevant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't that the\nproblem in your argument? Because your argument\nassumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a\nmoment ago, that once there has been a finding that he\ninformed the court that he did not want mitigation\nevidence presented, that in effect is a matter of --\nbinds him as a matter of law for all time.\nAnd what he is saying here is look, if I had\nknown that there was this kind of mitigating evidence,\nas opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end\nof the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver,\nif you want to call it that. I would not have made that\nrepresentation to the court. And what I want is an\nevidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact,\nwhen I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I\ndidn't mean this.\nAnd he wants a hearing for that. The only\nway it seems to me that you can properly win on the\nissue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I\nthink you said a moment ago. That once there is a\nfinding that he made a statement, whatever its\npredicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating\nevidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a\nmatter of law.\nMy question is, do you have any authority\nfor that?\nMR. CATTANI: Simply the AEDPA 2254(e). I\ndon't have a specific case that also would go directly\nto that point.\nYour Honor, I would also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Souter's\nquestion highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit\nopinion, for me anyway. Do you understand the hearing\nthat they directed to be on the waiver question, or is\nthe hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation\nevidence that he now wants to present?\nMR. CATTANI: It seems to me the hearing is\ndirected at presenting all of the mitigation evidence\nthat he now wants to present.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't it have to go to\nboth? Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to\nshow that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence\nthat was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that\nI wouldn't have objected to.\nAnd he then wants to proceed with respect to\nhis inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the\nexistence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't\nlook to.\nThere's a dual purpose, I thought.\nMR. CATTANI: I would agree with that, but\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't agree with it.\nI thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear\nthat it did not agree with the district court's\ndetermination that he had waived mitigating evidence. I\nthought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that\nfinding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating\nevidence.\nMR. CATTANI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that so? I mean,\nthat's what that -- one of the reasons the case was\nhere, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a\ndistrict court factual finding that he had waived any\nmitigating evidence. Isn't that what happened?\nMR. CATTANI: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it wasn't remanding for\na hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence.\nIt made the determination that he had not waived it, and\nthen remanded for investigation into what that\nmitigating evidence would be.\nMR. CATTANI: I don't know that it's\ncompletely clear as to what the Ninth Circuit is saying\ncan be developed and how that evidence can be used.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's clear at least\nthat they disagreed with the finding of the district\ncourt that there had been a waiver, no?\nMR. CATTANI: That's right, Your Honor, and\nI think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's clear that they\ndisagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive.\nIs anything clear beyond that? I mean, I guess I'm\nhesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the\nChief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court\ndid.\nI mean, there's no question that they found\nthat the -- the State trial court's finding with respect\nto waiver or whatever we want to call it was not\nnecessarily dispositive. I don't think it's clear that\nthey found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm\nwrong.\nMR. CATTANI: The Ninth Circuit ordered an\nevidentiary hearing to allow him to develop whatever\nmitigation he's proffered in Federal court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But that could\nhave, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual\npurpose. One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or\nthe nondispositive character of the State court's\nfinding; and two, to show relief for inadequate\nassistance of counsel.\nAnd the question here is that, the immediate\nquestion is what exactly did the State court find with\nrespect to -- oh, sorry -- what exactly did the Ninth\nCircuit find with respect to the State court finding?\nAnd there's no question that the Ninth\nCircuit assumed that the State court finding was not\nnecessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's\nclear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you\ncould help me if I'm wrong.\nMR. CATTANI: Well, the Ninth Circuit\nclearly held that the State court's determination of the\nfacts was unreasonable. And that's the problem with its\ndecision because if the determination of facts was\nreasonable, it obviates the need for any further\nevidentiary hearing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on the waiver point,\nlet's assume that this case had not come in -- come\nhere, and you had gone back to the district court\npursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit.\nSurely you would have taken the position, or\nyou could have taken the position if the evidence\ndeveloped that way, that he really knew or should have\nknown about all this mitigating evidence and he waived.\nYou certainly could continue to take that position in\nthe district court.\nMR. CATTANI: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the district court\nwould say I now have a more full, factual record, and I\nmake the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there\nwasn't.\nMR. CATTANI: Yes, but the point we've tried\nto make is that he was allowed an opportunity to develop\nhis claim about whether his -- whether he made that\nstatement and whether he intended to instruct his\nattorney not to present any mitigating evidence. He\nsubmitted an affidavit where he said, if my counsel had\ntold me there was this evidence of a genetic\npredisposition to violence, I would have allowed that to\nbe presented.\nThe court -- there was no need for an\nevidentiary hearing because the court simply accepted --\naccepted as true that Landrigan would have provided that\ntestimony.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how could the district\ncourt on remand find that there was a valid waiver when\nthe Ninth Circuit says on A-17, the appendix to the\npetition, for all the foregoing reasons, Landrigan has\nnot waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective\nassistance of counsel?\nMR. CATTANI: I think you're correct. The\nNinth Circuit has specifically found that the\ndetermination of facts was unreasonable and found that\nLandrigan has established a colorable claim of\nineffective assistance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it has not waived. Not\nthat the district court was -- didn't have enough\nevidence before it. It says the foregoing, Landrigan\nhas not waived the right to assert a claim for effective\nassistance.\nSo how can you possibly say that that\nquestion is still open?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The district court has to\naccept that he hasn't waived. And what it's sent back\nfor is for all of the facts that show -- that show he\nhad ineffective assistance of counsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question.\nIt seems to me that there are two separate parts to the\nwaiver issue. One, did he intend to say I don't want to\nput on any mitigating evidence?\nBut then the second part of the question is,\nwas that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just\nas a guilty plea or something like that has to be.\nSo is it enough for you to say it's clear\nwhat he intended, or is it also part of your burden to\nsay that that intent was expressed in a way that was\nknowing and voluntary, compliant with the rule that\napplies to waivers of constitutional rights?\nMR. CATTANI: I think it's clearly enough\nsimply to say that, as I indicated, even if it had just\nbeen an avowal by the attorney that this defendant has\ninstructed me not to present mitigating evidence, that\nthat would be enough.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a sufficient\nwaiver without inquiring as to whether it was a knowing\nand intelligent waiver, that he knew what he could put\nin, and so forth and so on?\nMR. CATTANI: Yes, it is, Your Honor. I\nthink to the extent that the defendant wants to raise\nthat, he can raise that in a State post-conviction\nproceeding. He should make that type of argument in the\npost-conviction proceeding.\nAnd that's not what he did here. An\nanalogous situation is that -- came up in a case that\nthe defense, that Landrigan has cited, Iowa versus\nTovar. And this Court expressly noted that the time to\nraise a claim -- that case involved whether it was a\ncounsel -- it was a decision to waive counsel at a plea\nproceeding. And this Court noted that the time to raise\nthat is in a post-conviction proceeding, and that the\nburden shifts to the defendant to raise that issue.\nAnd here if you look at the, the petition\nfor post-conviction relief, if you look at the affidavit\nthat Mr. Landrigan submitted, there, there is nothing in\nthere that suggests that \"I did not understand what I\nwas doing when I instructed my counsel not to present\nmitigation. I, I did not understand the concept of\nmitigation.\" There's nothing in there to suggest that.\nSo I would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there something that,\nisn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly \"I\ndidn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been\naware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given\nthat instruction?\"\nSo he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying\nwell, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I\nunderstood there was this kind of evidence and intended\nto preclude its introduction? Isn't that clear?\nMR. CATTANI: It's clear he is saying that I\nwould have permitted one type of mitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's the same thing,\nisn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent\nmy waiver was not knowing?\nMR. CATTANI: He, he's raised to it that\nextent as to that particular piece of mitigation. And\nthe trial court is expressly saying I disbelieve you\nwhen you say you would have allowed presentation of that\nmitigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And he's saying if you will\ngive me a hearing, district court, I will try to\ndemonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on\nthat point was unreasonable. The State court made that\nfinding based on its observation of me at trial and, and\nat the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a\nfurther chance to develop my evidence on, on\npost-conviction.\nAnd I want a hearing to develop that\nevidence in front of you, Federal district court, in\norder to prove that the State court's finding in light\nof that evidence was unreasonable.\nIsn't, isn't it correct that that's what\nhe's asking for now?\nMR. CATTANI: He is, Your Honor, but I would\nsuggest that there is no further evidence that was\npresented that he was attempting to present in State\ncourt regarding whether his waiver was knowing or\nvoluntary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How would -- how do we know\nthat?\nMR. CATTANI: How do we know we know that?\nBecause of the, the affidavit he submitted. And he,\nhe's required to submit an affidavit to establish a\ncolorable claim. And, and he's required to allege in\nhis post-conviction petition that his waiver is not\nknowing or voluntary. But the burden is on the\ndefendant --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you, I don't think you\nmean this, but you're not arguing that he just omitted\nthe magic words not knowing and voluntary?\nMR. CATTANI: I don't think, I don't think\nhe just omitted them. I think he was not raising that\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, I thought a second\nago you -- you admitted that to a degree he was, because\nhe is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind\nof mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived.\nTherefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing\nwaiver.\nMR. CATTANI: He raised that as to that one\naspect of mitigation. But it would have been very\nsimple for him, a simple matter for him to argue I\ndidn't understand the whole concept of mitigation. I\ndidn't understand what I was doing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Look, it would have been a\nbetter affidavit, it would have been better pleading.\nWe can stipulate to that. But is there, I don't see\nthere is any serious question that he is arguing right\nnow that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about\nit I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be\nprecluded from, from getting it in now.\nAnd, and if there's no question about that,\nthen -- then I think we're just fighting about words.\nMR. CATTANI: Well, I think the issue was\nresolved by the State court's factual determination that\nLandrigan was not credible even in making that assertion\nthat I would have allowed presentation of genetic\npredisposition of violence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And he says in the\ndistrict, he says in the district court: I want a\nhearing to show that I was credible. So credible that\nthe State court finding should be seen as an\nunreasonable resolution of a factual issue. I want a\nhearing.\nThat's all he's asking for, isn't it?\nMR. CATTANI: I would just suggest that\nthere is no further evidence other than putting\nLandrigan on the stand to say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's pretty good\nevidence, isn't it? I mean, he may be a believable\nwitness on this point. I don't know.\nMR. CATTANI: Well, I don't think there was\nany need for an, for the trial court to put Landrigan on\nthe stand having already presided over Landrigan's trial\nand sentencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he wants, if he\nwants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the Ninth\nCircuit, right? Because the Ninth Circuit held that he\ndidn't waive --\nMR. CATTANI: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- this claim?\nMR. CATTANI: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The part of the\nopinion that Justice Alito quoted on page A-17.\nMR. CATTANI: That, that's right, Your\nHonor. And I think that's why this case should be\nrelatively straightforward.\nBecause the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth\nCircuit's finding, that the State court unreasonably\nfound that, that Landrigan expressly instructed that his\nattorney not present any mitigation, given that --\nthat's the problem with the Ninth Circuit's opinion.\nEverything else builds on top of that.\nIf that's an incorrect holding, then the\nrest of the ruling is, is incorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even if it is incorrect, if\nwe -- we don't know precisely what he meant by the words\nhe said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a\nhearing? At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't\nhe, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school\nteacher, the various others? And he'll say anyone who\nlistens to those people will see that I have the most\nhorrendous upbringing anyone could have. The worst\nyou've ever heard.\nAnd my argument is that if only my lawyer\nhad looked into this at that moment in the trial, he\nwould have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what\nI can present for you. And if he had done it and told\nme that, anyone would have said, \"of course, present\nit.\" And I want a chance to show that that's true of my\ncase.\nNow, why shouldn't he have a hearing on\nthat? No hearing was given him in the State court.\nMR. CATTANI: Well, the problem with, that\nYour Honor, is that he didn't ask for, for a hearing to\npresent testimony from, for example, his biological\nmother and his ex-wife, who would have presented the\nvery evidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In State court he didn't.\nMR. CATTANI: In State court in the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, is the\nrequirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a\nState court on a general matter, \"I would like to show\nthrough a hearing,\" then he gives a whole lot of\naffidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce,\nthat then the State says \"no,\" you go into Federal court\nand say \"I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have\na few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra\nthings,\" no, you can't do that?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, there is a requirement\nin State court that you plead with specificity what type\nof claims you're raising in a post-conviction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Didn't he say my claim is\nineffective assistance?\nMR. CATTANI: Ineffective assistance --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Because he didn't\ninvestigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in\nwhich I was raised, and had he done it, he would have\nfound roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to\nshow that he should have done that because it would have\nchanged the result?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, his argument at\nState court was not that he didn't investigate that; his\nargument in the post-conviction proceeding was he could\nhave presented that through some other witnesses.\nThe -- his argument at the trial -- at the\npost-conviction --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not what I\nunderstood his argument that he wants to raise to be.\nIn his affidavit, it is a different argument. It is the\nbiological component of violence. \"Look, my grandfather\nwas convicted, my father was convicted,\" and so the\nmitigating evidence he wants to present at sentencing\nthat is I'm biologically predetermined to commit crimes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The criminal gene argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- which is\ncertainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation\nat a sentencing hearing.\nMR. CATTANI: Certainly. And that is, that\nis the main point I'm trying to make is that that was\nthe only thing he was asserting in his post-conviction\nproceeding, was that \"I would have liked have raised\nthis argument that I'm generically predisposed to\nviolence.\" The rest of the argument I think would have\nbeen frivolous because it was so obvious that he had\nrestricted, he had limited his counsel's, restricted his\ncounsel from presenting the very type of evidence that\nwe're talking about now, this other type of evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought all that evidence\nwas basically before the district court anyway. Didn't\nthe district court know about all of that when it made\nits ruling?\nMR. CATTANI: Yes, Your Honor and the trial\ncourt knew about it when it made its ruling.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the district court\nhad a proffer, but the district court but had not heard\nwitnesses, it had not heard evidence.\nMR. CATTANI: But, but the focus here is on\nthe reasonableness of the State court's factual finding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but the\nreasonableness of factual findings depends on what the\nevidence is that can go in on the issue of\nreasonableness. And there's a universe of difference\nbetween a proffer of evidence which the district court\nsays \"well, I'll assume that,\" on the one hand, and on\nthe other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses\nperhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court\nactually hears.\nYou know, you, sometimes you get a lot more\nimpressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make\nfor the sake of argument. And that seems to me a world\nof difference.\nMR. CATTANI: I don't necessarily disagree\nexcept that we're -- the focus has to be on what the\nclaim was that was raised in the State post-conviction\nproceeding; and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only thing, but the --\nthe -- I guess on that point, my only, my only reason\nfor raising this with you is on that point, it's not\nenough to say well, the district court assumed this. Or\nfor that matter, the State trial court assumed this.\nThat is not the same thing as putting in the\nevidence.\nMR. CATTANI: Except in this case we\ncertainly had the trial court that presided over the\nsentencing and had seen Landrigan in person and was\nuniquely qualified to make a credibility assessment\nregarding the points that Landrigan made in his\naffidavit, that \"I would have allowed presentation of\ngenetic predisposition.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask what might be an\nawfully elementary and stupid question? But -- it seems\nto me that there's no question about the facts of what\nhe said. And you can interpret him saying I don't want\nany mitigating evidence put it. But isn't it clear that\nthe waiver of the right to put in any mitigating\nevidence at a capital sentencing hearing is a\nconstitutional right of very important dimensions?\nAnd can that right be waived if the record\ndoes not show whether or not he knew the full right\nof -- that is available to every defendant in a capital\ncase? Namely, he had been advised by his counsel he\ncould put in all sorts of stuff. Is there anything to\nshow that there was that kind of waiver here, on the\nface of the record?\nMR. CATTANI: There, there's not a specific\ncolloquy that goes through --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then it is, as a matter of\nlaw, an ineffective waiver. Isn't the Ninth Circuit\ndead right, not factually, but just as a matter of law,\nthat you cannot waive this right unless the record shows\nthat he's fully advised of the scope of the right that\nhe's waiving.\nMR. CATTANI: Well, first, there's no\nauthority that I'm aware of that would require any type\nof a specific colloquy. I think this record --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's new to me also. I\nnever heard of it.\nMR. CATTANI: And I think that would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why should it be, why\nshould there be a less complete colloquy for this kind\nof waiver than a guilty plea itself? Now I admit\nthere's no authority on the point. But isn't it\nabsolutely obvious?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, I think the reason\nthere's no need for one is because a defendant can come\nin and if he really believes that his waiver was not\nknowing and voluntary, he has an opportunity to pursue\nthat type of claim in a post-conviction proceeding. And\nhe can come in and proffer whatever evidence he wants to\nproffer if, in fact, that's his claim, that he didn't\nunderstand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some kind of waivers, like\nwaiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a\ncolloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what\nconsequences of foregoing counsel are. So the judge\ndiscusses with him and, you know, points out what a --\nwhat a significant decision that is. But it doesn't\ntake a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the\nquestion, you know, \"do you agree that your counsel\nshould not introduce any mitigating evidence?\" I mean,\nit's clear on, on its face.\nMR. CATTANI: I would agree, Your Honor.\nAnd I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But doesn't that assume\nthat the defendant know what mitigating evidence is? I\nmean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, \"I\nthought mitigating evidence was just going to be what\nthe, these two relatives were going to testify to.\nThere was really much more, if my counsel had\ninvestigated.\" And that's not a knowing waiver.\nMR. CATTANI: I think that type of argument\nwas belied by what, what happened at the time of\nsentencing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, unless the argument\nis, and maybe this is what the other side its going to\nargue, that -- that when you make waiver of all\nmitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's\nreached that far in the criminal process what mitigating\nevidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements\nof mitigation that could have been introduced. Which\nwill almost never be the case. So that it's always\npossible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating\nevidence to come into the court a year later and say,\n\"Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence\nI didn't know about at the time. My grandfather was a\ncriminal. I didn't realize that at the time. And now I\nwant\" -- you know -- \"therefore my waiver was\nuninformed\" and, you know, we go back to square one and\ntry the case again.\nThat would always be possible, wouldn't it?\nMR. CATTANI: Well, I agree, Your Honor.\nAnd it's because the nature of mitigation is so open\nended, it would be difficult to explain precisely and\nhave a waiver of every conceivable item of mitigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And so are you, are you in\neffect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a\nknowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based\nupon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation\nevidence that in this case might come in? Are you\nsaying it need not be knowing in that sense?\nMR. CATTANI: I think a defendant needs to\nunderstand the nature -- the basic nature and concept of\nmitigation. But this case provides a good example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're not answering\nmy question. I -- we all agree that he needs to\nunderstand the basic concept of mitigation. Does his\nwaiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that I just\ndescribed? Or doesn't it? What's your position?\nMR. CATTANI: It does have to -- it does not\nhave to be knowing as to every conceivable aspect of\nmitigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it will nonetheless\nkind him if he comes in later and says look, I accept\nthe fact that it's my burden to show at this point that\nmy waiver was not a knowing one, and that there us\nmitigating evidence that I would have let in?\nAre you saying that he simply as a matter of\nlaw cannot say that? Or cannot be heard to say that?\nMR. CATTANI: He is bound by that, Your\nHonor. And if I could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the answer to my\nquestion is yes?\nMR. CATTANI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As a matter of law, he\ncannot do what he is trying to do here?\nMR. CATTANI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. CATTANI: And Your Honor, l think here\nwe have a situation where the defendant is now trying to\nproffer evidence that is inconsistent with what counsel\nwas trying to present at the time of sentencing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are -- what you\nare saying is that it was sufficient when he said, I\ndon't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence,\nand the trial court said, do you know what that means,\nand he said yes?\nMR. CATTANI: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That doesn't have to be\nfleshed out at all, unlike a Rule 11 colloquy. To see\nif he really understands? Do you know what that means,\nand he yes and that's the end of it?\nMR. CATTANI: I think that is sufficient,\nYour Honor. And again, here he's now raising this claim\nof genetic predisposition. The sentencing memorandum\nthat counsel submitted attempted to pore Landrigan as\nsomeone who is basically a good person who committed\nthis crime because he was under the influence of alcohol\nand drugs. This new type of evidence -- and the\nsentencing memorandum -- and you'll see that Landrigan\nhad been evaluated by an expert, who had said he didn't\nhave any mental deficiencies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to begin by clearing up what\nexactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver\nand what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that\nset of issues in our judgment. I then would like to\nspend a couple of minutes on what I think the Ninth\nCircuit did and what effect that would have on this\nCourt's disposition of the case. And if there's any\ntime remaining. I'd like to turn to the question of\nwhether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant\nan evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're\nasking for.\nNow, with respect to this question of\nwhether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid\ncounsel for the State is just wrong about this. It's\nimportant to understand how this comes up. We asserted\na claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient\nperformance and prejudice. The State asserted as a\ndefense to that claim: No, no, he's waived.\nAnd the trial judge, the State habeas judge\nin the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that\nand said, well, yes, he's waived. We then filed a\npetition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't\nrely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing\nand intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst.\nThat's at page 92 of the joint appendix.\nThat motion for rehearing was denied without\nany further comment. We then took a petition to review\nto the Arizona Supreme Court. That's also in the joint\nappendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in\nwhich we specifically argued that you can't look to this\nso-called waiver as a defense to our claim of\nineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and\nintent.\nNow, in the State's response to our\npetition, which unfortunately is not in the joint\nappendix but is in the record, the State says: No, this\nwaiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally\ndefaulted because this procedure was decided on direct\nreview. But the one thing the State does not say is\nthat you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too\nlate, it can't be considered.\nWe then went to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I'm looking at\npage 92 of the joint appendix. I don't, I don't see\nthat.\nMR. VERRILLI: I may have the wrong page.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's rather\nimportant, don't you think?\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry. I will find it\nfor Your Honor.\nI'm sorry for the delay here. The motion\nfor rehearing is, I'm sorry, 99, and on 102 is where we\nraise it, and then subsequently -- then subsequently we\nraise it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that effective? Does\nthe court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, it doesn't have to,\nbut, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it your obligation to\nraise it in your original motion rather than in a motion\nfor rehearing?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, there's no -- but the\npoint is that's not -- when we took this to the Arizona\nSupreme Court that's not an argument that the State made\nin opposition to our raising Johnson against Zerbst.\nThen when we got to the Federal district court we raised\nthis again, this exact argument in Federal district\ncourt, and the State in Federal district court didn't\nobject that we had failed to raise this appropriately in\nthe State proceedings.\nWe took it to the Ninth Circuit. They\ndidn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it\nappropriately in the State proceedings. The first time\nthat question has even been raised here is in the reply\nbrief on the merits in this Court.\nAnd I think that's tied to the next point I\nwant to make, which is significant, which is as the case\ncomes to this Court the Ninth Circuit has ruled that we\nhave met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are\ntherefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\nNow, what the State is essentially saying\nis, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you\ndidn't raise them adequately in the State court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And is it just an\nevidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination\nto commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the\nwaiver question?\nMR. VERRILLI: On both, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why did -- the\ncourt on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver. So\nwhy would they then send it back for an evidentiary\nhearing on waiver?\nMR. VERRILLI: Let me move to that if I\ncould, because I do think that's significant. I think\nthe Court has elucidated the two potential readings of\nthe Ninth Circuit's decision. It seemed to us as we\nprepared this case on the merits that the reality is\nthat the two, the issue of performance and the issue of\nwaiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after\na hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a\ndiligent job of performing the investigation, and did\ninstruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence\nwas, then you view the waiver in a different light than\nof course you would if the counsel hadn't. So we\nacknowledge here that the proper disposition of this\ncase ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't your\nassertion even in this motion for a hearing. It wasn't\nthat he didn't know what he was giving up. It was\nrather the sentencing transcript, you say, \"does not\nestablish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and\nintelligently waived his right to present mitigating\nevidence. Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that\nright without thought, in the heat of anger, and in\nfrustration with his attorney during that particular\nproceeding.\"\nMR. VERRILLI: We're trying to establish\nthere, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that was a factual\nmatter best, best disposed of by the judge who was\npresent at the time. And he didn't think it was in the\nheat of anger. He did think that it was a valid waiver.\nNow, you're raising a totally different issue. You're\nsaying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all\nthe elements of mitigation that the waiver might\nembrace. That wasn't the argument you were making here.\nMR. VERRILLI: Your Honor, I want to respond\ndirectly to Your Honor's question, if you'll just permit\nme one more thought about the Ninth Circuit and I'll\nturn right back to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. VERRILLI: So in other words, we are\nmaking a more modest request for relief here which, is\naffirmance of the judgment sending back for an\nevidentiary hearing, but with a recognition that the\nevidentiary hearing ought to deal with the issue of\nwaiver, which should be understood to be left open. I\nthink we're conceding something here, that waiver ought\nto be left open and not definitively resolved. It's\npremature to definitively resolve that against the State\nwithout an inquiry.\nNow, turning to Your Honor's point, the --\nwith respect to whether there was a waiver here or not\nand what the State judge did or didn't do, something\nvery significant here that I think the State's argument\njust overlooks. There's an assumption in the State's\nargument that Landrigan's conduct at the sentencing\nhearing itself was a waiver and considered to be a\nwaiver. But if one looks at the transcript of that\nhearing, and this is D to the appendix to the petition\nand beginning at page D-4 -- D-3 is where the colloquy\noccurs where this alleged waiver happened. The very\nnext thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs,\nis the trial judge says: Okay, I want to hear from the\nmitigation witnesses.\nThen the mitigation witnesses say: Well,\nwe're not going to testify. Then the very next thing\nthat occurs is the trial judge says: Well, I want a\nproffer of what they would have said. Then when -- then\nwhen all that's said and done, the trial judge says to\nthe lawyer -- - and this is at D-15 -- you got anything\nelse, and the lawyer says, no, Your Honor, that's all\nI've got, all I've got is what's in the sentencing memo\nand these two witnesses. Then the judge proceeds to\npass sentence. That's the -- the particularly important\npages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see\nthat what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's\nstatements as a waiver, because if she had treated those\nstatements as a waiver what she would have said is,\nwell, here's the aggravation case, Mr. Landrigan has\nwaived mitigation, he has a right to do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is belt and\nsuspenders, that's all. The -- I don't think any judge\nlikes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver.\nThis judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't\nwaived it there's nothing there --\nMR. VERRILLI: I respectfully --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because he wasn't\nbringing in at this point the biological -- by the way,\nbiological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor\nrather than an aggravating factor?\nMR. VERRILLI: Let me address your second\nquestion first and then your first question.\nI think that that in two senses does not\naccurately represent what this mitigation case presented\nto the State court and presented to the Federal court is\nall about. With respect even to his affidavit, which I\ndon't think fairly under Arizona procedure can define\nthe full scope of his claim, but with respect to that\naffidavit alone, what it says is not genetic\npredisposition. It says the \"biological component of\nviolence.\" That's the language that Mr. Landrigan's\naffidavit uses.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the prior\nparagraph says it's because of the history of his\nbiological grandfather, biological brother, and\nbiological child. That suggests to me it's a genetic\nclaim and --\nMR. VERRILLI: But one other thing it does\nthat's very significant, Mr. Chief Justice, is it also\nsays that these witnesses can attest to the use of\nalcohol and drugs by the biological mother when\nLandrigan was in utero.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he knew\nabout that. He knew about that mitigating evidence at\nthe trial because his biological mother was there.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, but what he's saying\nthat he would have agreed to, it seems to me the only\nfair reading in this affidavit, which again I don't\nthink fairly defines the full scope of what he's allowed\nto proceed with under Arizona procedure, but with\nrespect to this affidavit he's saying, well, if you had\nhad an expert who could have come in and given testimony\nabout fetal alcohol syndrome and the organic brain\ndamage and other impairments that it causes, I would\nhave cooperated with that. And that's really\nsignificant because if you look at page D-21 of the\nappendix to the petition --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How could that be\nhelpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother\nto testify about drug and alcohol abuse? What use would\nthe expert be if the potential predicate --\nMR. VERRILLI: Because all the biological\nmother would have had to do was to give that information\nto the expert. That's a routine matter, for experts to\ngather factual information and assimilate it into an\nexpert opinion and then provide it to the court. That\ncould have happened easily here.\nAnd I think it's very significant because on\npage 21 you'll see that the trial judge makes a\nfundamental error about this exact issue. She says:\nWell, I'll grant this, I'll take the mother's testimony\nas a proffer. I'll consider the possibility of fetal\nalcohol syndrome, but all fetal alcohol syndrome\nestablishes is that the kid will also have a\npredisposition to addiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The defendant would\nhave been happy to have his biological mother talk with\nthe expert, but was unwilling to have his biological\nmother say the same thing in court?\nMR. VERRILLI: Sure, and I don't think\nthere's anything unreasonable about that. Those are\nvery different experiences, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. It\nseems unreasonable to me. He was trying to spare his\nmother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court?\nThat's what he had in mind?\nMR. VERRILLI: If I -- whatever else\nhappened, the trial judge here considered this evidence\nof mitigation and did a weighing. And the key point I\nwant to make sure I make here is that therefore any\nevidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on\nfetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other\nevidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the\ntime and had considered at the time and had weighed at\nthe time by this trial judge. And that's a claim of\nprejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even\nif one assumes -- and we dispute it and I'd like too\ntalk about that -- but even if one assumes that there is\na finding and we can't do anything about it that\nLandrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation\nof any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you\nthink it's possible to have a valid waiver of the\npresentation of mitigating evidence or is it always\npossible that some additional evidence would come up and\nyou say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have\nwaived it?\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think there's a yes\nor no answer to that question. It's something --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can't give a yes\nanswer to whether it's ever possible.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. Yes, it's possible.\nIt's certainly possible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. VERRILLI: But I think I don't -- I want\nto make sure I don't leave any implication that the rule\nwe're asking for here is going to open the door to lots\nof claims, because I don't think it does for two sets of\nreasons. One is a procedural set of reasons and that's\nthe -- that, we refer the Court to the Blackledge\nagainst Allison decision -- that if -- that it's not\ngoing to be enough in every case for you to plead an\nadequate claim and then jump right to an evidentiary\nhearing. As the court said in Allison, the district\ncourt has available to it a number of tools that it can\nuse to test the claim before granting an evidentiary\nhearing. So there's a limitation there. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you do it\nconcretely, Mr. Verrilli, for this case. The defendant\nis being rather obstreperous and says: I don't want any\nmitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy. And that's\nhow he's trying to portray himself. What -- you said,\nand you allow for the possibility that there could be a\nknowing waiver of mitigation. What would have had to\ntranspire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think that's important, and\nhopefully it will help explain why we think that this is\na narrow -- that the rule we're asking for here is a\nnarrow one, and it's not going to open the door to lots\nof claims. It's clear that just like the waiver of any\nother fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial,\nthe defendant's got to understand what mitigation means.\nHe's got to understand its significance in the\nproceedings --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he certainly\nunderstood that. He said if you want to give me the\ndeath penalty, bring it on, I'm ready for it. The\npurpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the\nimposition of the death penalty. He says bring it on.\nMR. VERRILLI: And he needs to be assisted\nby competent counsel. That's a consistent theme of this\nCourt's decisions on the Johnson inquiry. And so if you\nhave a situation in which you have documented that the\nclient understands what mitigation is -- and frankly I\ndon't think, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthis is the kind of documentation that ought to suffice.\nBut even if you had that, even if you documented that\nthe defendant understood it, even if you documented that\nthe defendant clearly waived it and documented that was\ndone with counsel's assistance, then it seems to me it\nis going to be very hard for a habeas petitioner to\nplead something that's going to get past --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't the type\nof documentation that would be sufficient? He\nunderstands what the consequence of not putting\nmitigating evidence on is going to be.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, because I think there\nisn't clarity at all that he understands what mitigating\nevidence is, what the full scope of it is and how it\ncould --\nTHE COURT: He's present in the court while\nthey're making a proffer of this sort of mitigating\nevidence. The judge is quite careful, saying okay, if\nhe doesn't want the evidence, I want to know what it is.\nAnd he called the two witnesses. And all that this\ndefendant does is undermine his lawyer's effort to\npresent the mitigation.\nMR. VERRILLI: But again, Mr. Chief Justice,\nat the time the trial judge didn't treat that as a\nwaiver. And so I don't think you can cut off his\nability to litigate an ineffective assistance claim\nyears later on the ground that it was an ineffective\nwaiver.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, are you claiming that\n-- are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately\nrepresent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to\nthe question of waiver? In other words, when -- that\nthe attorney should have insisted that the judge go\nthrough some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with\nhim about waiver and inform him of certain things about\nwhat he was giving up? Are you making that claim?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think, Justice Alito, we're\nmaking a couple of different claims, not that claim, but\na couple of different claims. One is, and it pertains\nparticularly to a mental health expert, that even if\nLandrigan behaved exactly the way -- at 13 -- he in fact\nbehaved in the counterfactual world in which he had\nreceived adequate representation, that the mental health\nexpert testimony could have been proffered to the Court,\nhad it been prepared and developed, would have been\nconsidered, and could have made a critically important\ndifference and for precisely the reason that\nJustice Ginsburg's question suggested, which is that\nhe's obviously behaving badly in this situation.\nWhat the trial court ruled out of that is,\nwell, he's an amoral person. What the mental health\ntestimony would give you is an alternative frame of\nreference for making a reasoned moral judgment about\nthis guy, and could be critically important in\nexplaining that behavior. So even within the confines\nof accepting that the world would have unfolded exactly\nthe way it did, it was ineffective to have dropped the\nball on preparing that kind of evidence.\nThen it's also ineffective in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I'm not\nfollowing you. You mean the mental health expert's\ntestimony could have gone to whether the judge should\nhave accepted the waiver?\nMR. VERRILLI: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's what you\nwere saying, I'm sorry.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, to the basic weighing the\nmitigation which the judge undertook based on all\nproffered evidence. Then beyond that, we're making an\nargument that the waiver that, even if you are going to\nconsider that a waiver, you can't consider it a knowing\nand voluntary waiver, knowing intelligent waiver\nsupported adequately by the efforts of counsel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a separate\nquestion, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver?\nIsn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which\nis a question of fact, which is a question of whether\nhad he been informed of the possibility of mitigation\nevidence relating to a history of family violence, he\nwould have persisted in blocking the admission of any\nmitigation evidence? Isn't that the issue? Not whether\nit was knowing and intelligent. That would be a\nseparate legal question.\nMR. VERRILLI: No. I don't think that's the\nissue. With all due respect, Justice Alito, I think the\ntest under Strickland is whether there was sufficient\nperformance, which we think we have a very powerful\nrecord of here, and then a reasonable probability that\nthe outcome would have been different. And I think the\ninquiry here that the State habeas judge is undertaking\nis the reasonable probability inquiry. That seems to me\nto be a mixed question that requires --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, it's a mixed question.\nBut if the post-conviction relief court found as a\nmatter of fact that even had he known about the\npossibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he\nwould have persisted in refusing to cooperate -- if\nthere was such a finding, and know you dispute it -- and\nif you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would\nhave to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, taking our first\nargument to the side, our first argument which I've been\ndiscussing about what happened at the hearing, I think\nwith respect to that argument the answer's no, that\nargument stands without any need to disprove the factual\nfinding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we\ndon't concede that.\nBut if it is a factual finding, then yes, we\nwould have to disprove it by clear and convincing\nevidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're\nasking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the standard? I\nask that because I'm not certain from what I heard\npreviously -- I think the State was saying that the only\nissue that was raised before the State proceeding,\ncollateral, the State collateral post-sentencing\nproceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that\nhe had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something\nlike that.\nWhen I've looked at this, it's on page 88,\nthe motion filed says we have two claims. One claim is\nthe claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about\nit's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and\nalcohol.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where are you quoting from?\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Joint appendix A. And then\nthere's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to\nfailing to investigate these alternative sources, we\nalso want to say that counsel failed to explore\nadditional grounds, and that was the sister. And the\nsister was going to testify that the mother -- the\nfoster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she\nhas a whole list of things in her affidavit.\nSo is that still before us? I mean, isn't\nthat something you want to argue?\nMR. VERRILLI: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Your Honor, for\nbringing us back to that question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the claim would be\nthis: You want a hearing in which you're going to\npresent the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what\nthe school says, what happened to him at school, all\nthings that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the\nState court, and that the biological gene. And you want\nto say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your\nmouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this\nbeen looked into and presented to the defendant, the\ndefendant would not have said don't present any of that,\nit would have been presented, and it would have made a\ndifference.\nWhat -- is that what you want to do?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. VERRILLI: With one addition, which is\nthis one, fetal alcohol syndrome expert testimony is\nvery important.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, with that too.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what the Ninth Circuit\nsaid is, we'll give you a hearing. We don't know if\nyou're right or wrong. What's the standard for giving\nyou the hearing? I -- a lot of things in the law aren't\nalways written down exactly, and I was under the\nimpression that trial judges often give hearings on what\nyou might call seat of the pants. I'd like to hear more\nabout it. I've been on appellate courts where rightly\nor wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know\nmore about this. I can't quite understand it. Let's\nhave a hearing. And we're going to tell the trial judge\nto do it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I thought you\nalready conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for\na hearing on this question of whether he had waived,\neffectively waived mitigating evidence.\nMR. VERRILLI: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't what the Ninth\nCircuit said.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It found that he had not\nwaived mitigating evidence. So what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not actually talking\nabout waiver. My question was just generally what I\nasked. What is the standard there on whether you get a\nhearing?\nMR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, would you\npermit me to answer that question, and I'll come back to\nYour Honor's?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever.\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you. The -- with\nrespect to the standard, there are two things that we\nhave to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing.\nOne is that we're not disentitled under the analysis\nunder Section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the Court's\nMichael Williams decision, to show that the court below\nfound it, it was not raised in the cert petition. We\npointed out in the brief in opposition that it wasn't\nraised, it had nothing about it. That's established and\nthe case comes to the court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is established?\nThat you've satisfied (e)(2)?\nMR. VERRILLI: That (e)(2) does not apply to\nus proceeding to an evidentiary hearing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why, because you\nsatisfy it or because it doesn't apply?\nMR. VERRILLI: Because the -- there is no\nlack of diligence here that would trigger us meeting the\nheightened requirements of (e)(2), and therefore it\ndoesn't apply to bar us. That's the theory.\nNow, with -- the other thing we have to\nshow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, you'll\njust have to bear with me.\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying you\nsatisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of\ndiligence. Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B),\nwhich is to show that no reasonable factfinder would\nhave found him guilty, in other words words subject to\n--\nMR. VERRILLI: No. No, Your Honor. That's\n-- as we understand the Michael Williams decision\ninterpreting that provision, Your Honor, those\nrequirements only kick in in a situation where you\nhaven't shown diligence and therefore you're at fault,\nand you can overcome your fault by meeting those\nheightened standards. They don't apply in a situation\nwhere you have been diligent and therefore you're not --\nthey don't apply to you at all.\nWith respect to the -- what else -- with\nrespect to what else we'd have to show, we'd have to\nshow that -- and this is the Townsend standard, which\nnothing has changed -- that we've alleged facts which,\nif proven, entitle us to relief. Those are the two\nthings we have to show and we've done both of those\nthings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the district court has\nsubstantial discretion in determining whether or not to\ngrant that hearing on that basis.\nMR. VERRILLI: And the Ninth Circuit -- and\nit seems to us actually, Your Honor, under Townsend in\nthat situation the hearing's mandatory. The district\ncourt would have discretion under habeas, under habeas\npractice, to hold a hearing as a discretionary matter\neven in a situation where we haven't shown a mandatory\nentitlement to it. So there is discretion there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Part of that discretion\nis, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a\nlikelihood of a different result?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me that\nthat is the difficult part of your case based on this\nevidence.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, but I think -- what I\nthink is important there is that that issue ought to be\ndecided after an evidentiary hearing when you know what\nit's going to be. It's premature to decide that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we know what the\nfetal alcohol testimony is going to be.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, that's true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we could make a\ndetermination or the court of appeals could make a\ndetermination or the district court could make a\ndetermination how likely that would to be affect the\nresult.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, they could, but it\nseems to me not until you actually hear the expert\ntestimony, and then we have all of the other testimony\nthat Justice Breyer detailed that you'd want to\nconsider.\nI do want to try to come back,\nJustice Scalia, to your point. Yes, we acknowledge that\nthe Ninth Circuit went too far in the way Your Honor\ndescribed. But you don't get from that conclusion to\nthe conclusion that you ought to grant the relief that\nthe State is requesting here, which is a reversal and\ndirecting dismissal of the petition, because to get to\nthat you have to show that there's no set of\ncircumstances under which we could prevail.\nWe're -- our position is an intermediate\none, which is that the right answer here is that the\njudgment to send it back for an evidentiary hearing was\ncorrect and should be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do\nwith -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the\ndissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the\nmitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, \"genetic\npredisposition to violence would not have outweighed its\naggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was\nundeterable and even from prison would present a future\ndanger\"?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think the answer is that\nthat is an inappropriately truncated assessment of the\nmitigation case and a wrongly focused assessment of the\nmitigation case, which ought to Focus on the troubled\nhistory and the fetal alcohol syndrome, which provide a\nmedical mental health explanation for his conduct which\nis quite different and that -- and so that's what ought\nto be balanced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was presented\nin the State court proceedings.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's not correct, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The biological\nmother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.\nMR. VERRILLI: The fact that she used\nabusive -- that she abused alcohol, but not the medical\nexpert testimony explaining what effects that would\nhave. That's precisely the thing that wasn't there and\nthat was the big problem.\nSo I do think that that -- that's why we\nneed an evidentiary hearing, to develop that. This\nweighing, by the way --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think the\nState trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol\nsyndrome?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, if you look at page\nD-21, Mr. Chief Justice, what you'll see is actually\nproof in the transcript that she had no familiarity,\nbecause she said on page D-21 all it does is predispose\nyou to being an addict yourself. But fetal alcohol\nsyndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that\ncan bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability.\nIf I could just say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just one other\nquestion on a different matter. In Judge Bias's\ndissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from\nthe Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed\nwith this appeal and wants the execution scheduled. Can\nyou comment on that?\nMR. VERRILLI: Sure. What there was that\nthe Ninth Circuit, upon receiving this letter, contacted\ncounsel for Mr. Landrigan, asked him -- asked them to go\nvisit him in prison and find out what's going on. They\ndid so. They reported back to the Ninth Circuit that\nMr. Landrigan did in fact want to proceed with the\nappeals. He has continued to want to proceed with the\nappeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns\nout there were neurological problems that were\nafflicting him, very serious, at the time. So that's\nwhat happened.\nIf I could say in conclusion, just remind\nthe Court what it said in the first Norrell decision,\nthat even in the world of habeas there's a difference\nbetween deference and abdication. And in a situation\nlike this one, in which the State court has not afforded\nan evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the\ndevelopment of the evidence that bears directly on\nMr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication\nto hold that he can be conclusively barred from\nproceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on\nthe basis of the present record.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Verrilli.\n"
