        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 09-338,\nRenico v. Lett.\nMr. McGormley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McGORMLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nBecause this is a habeas case arising from a\nmurder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the\nthreshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent that the\nMichigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied\nin rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had\nabused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due\nto deadlock.\nThe Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas,\nignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad\ndiscretion, due the trial court determination. Here\nthere was a note suggesting acrimonious deliberations\nreceived early on in the second day of deliberations,\nfollowed by a second note suggesting a deadlock after\napproximately 10 hours of trial testimony and 4 hours of\ndeliberations.\nThe trial court at that time engaged the\nforeperson in a colloquy, a two-part colloquy, in which\nthe foreperson not only confirmed the content of the\nfirst note, but also confirmed the existence of a\ndeadlock.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. The content\nof the first note was a query of the court. And that\nquery was: \"What happens if we can't reach a verdict?\"\nIsn't that substantially different? Doesn't that\nsuggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are\nthe consequences of its actions and whether reaching a\nconsensus is possible?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, Justice Sotomayor, the\nfirst note was the note regarding our raised voices\ndisturbing other proceedings. The second note\nregards -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. How long\nbefore that last note was that?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt refers to that as early on in the second day of\ndeliberations. And then there is approximately 3 hours\nand 15 more minutes of deliberations, because after the\nsecond note -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did anybody hear the\nvoices?\nMR. McGORMLEY: The record doesn't disclose,\ndoesn't disclose that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what\nfacts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show\nthat the Court acted, quote, and this is from our\nearlier Perez case, the very first in this area,\n\"deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously\" in\ndeclaring a mistrial. What in the facts you have\nrecited -\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- show that activity?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Justice Sotomayor, the first\npoint I would make is that, of course, this is on habeas\nreview, and so the -- the Michigan Supreme Court made\nfactual findings here that would be due deference.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the factual\nfinding that you think we have to give deference to? I\nknow the facts you've recited. There don't appear to be\nany of the facts with respect to what occurred during\nthe activity. So what factual finding do we have to\ngive deference to?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, the factual finding by\nthe Michigan Supreme Court that -- that there appeared\nto be acrimonious deliberations. That's a factual\nfinding due deference under (e)(1).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm not sure how\nthat finding supports the finding, or a finding, that\nthe Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not\nprecipitously.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Going back to this Court's\nopinion in Perez, considering sound judgment,\ndiscretion, considering all the circumstances, here we\nhave to look at the totality of the circumstances in\nthat it was a relatively short trial, that we have a\nnote that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious\ndeliberations, the second note that could be reasonably\nconstrued as a deadlock.\nAnd then the trial court did not declare a\nmistrial at that point. Rather, the trial court brings\nthe jury out and engages in a colloquy. And in that\ncolloquy, the trial court accepts the foreperson's\nanswer at her word. And that is: \"Are you going to be\nable to reach unanimous verdict?\" The answer being:\n\"No.\" And in fact, it's the Sixth Circuit who\nsecond-guessed in this case by saying: You can't place\nthat much weight on that statement by the foreperson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the foreperson at\nfirst hesitated. When the court asked the question,\n\"Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not,\"\nthen there's no response. And then the court says, \"Yes\nor no?\" And only at that second point does the\nforeperson say \"no.\" So it was a reluctant \"no.\"\nMR. McGORMLEY: I don't necessarily believe\nit was a reluctant no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She might have been\nsneezing. I mean, we don't know what caused the pause,\ndo we?\nMR. McGORMLEY: That's correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's another factor\nin this. We have the transcript. Are you urging that,\nbecause the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw\nthe jury, worked with the jury, that that's something\nthat deserves a special measure of respect?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Absolutely,\nJustice Ginsburg. And this Court has qualified that as\nbroad discretion and special respect due the trial court\ndetermination, after the trial court is the one viewing\nthe jury in real time. So absolutely. And in fact,\nthis -- this risk of coercion was recognized also by\nthis Court in Arizona v. Washington.\nJUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you another\nquestion about what happened?\nAfter the foreperson said: No, Judge, we\nare not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge\nsays: All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury\nis dismissed. And then the next entry in the transcript\nthat we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we\ncould set a new trial date. Now, Mr. Gordon was defense\n-- was the defense attorney?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So when did he leave? Do we\nknow when he left? He was present when the judge said\nthat she was going to declare a mistrial?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Correct. But I don't know\nthat minute or so gap. I don't know when Mr. Gordon\nsnuck out.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, along the\nline of -- the same line of questioning, I understand\nabout AEDPA. I understand about deference, the\njurisdictions. Just tell me a little bit about how this\noften works in State courts and in Federal courts?\nWould it be good practice, in your view -\nand that may not control your case, but would it be good\npractice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this\ncolloquy and then say: The jurors are dismissed while I\ntalk with counsel. And you say: Counsel, in light of\nthis response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial. Do\nyou have any comment?\nIs that good practice?\nMR. McGORMLEY: It may be good practice, but\nthe question becomes whether it's constitutionally\nrequired.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking -- I'm asking\nif it's good practice as a general practice.\nMR. McGORMLEY: I would say -- well, in this\nCourt -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- because that\nwill bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue. I\nunderstand deference. I understand that all intendments\nare in favor of what the State Supreme Court found. I'm\njust -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in\nthe real world?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, I believe that\ndiscussion with counsel is a factor in -- in the\nconsideration. I don't dispute that. But this Court\nhas never held that it's a requirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if, in fact, there\nisn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not\ndeclare a mistrial? Can the judge go ahead and declare\na mistrial?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Absolutely. And here -- and\nhere's why.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not a very big fact.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, it's important in the\ncoercion context, because certainly the trial court has\nan independent obligation to ensure a just judgment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That independent\nobligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views\njust as a matter of good practice?\nMR. McGORMLEY: It may be. It may be\nreinforced in certain circumstances, but again, we are\nlooking at the totality of the circumstances when we\nhave a note indicating acrimony, a note indicating\ndeadlock, and then the colloquy in which there's an\nunequivocal -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, certainly it's good\npractice. If both counsel agree that there is manifest\nnecessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a\ndouble jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Correct. Under Dennis, if\nthe defendant consents, then there is no double\njeopardy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was there an objection here\nby counsel for the defendant?\nMR. McGORMLEY: No. No, there wasn't. But,\nyou know, the colloquy is relatively short. But no, I\nbelieve the defendant's counsel could have objected.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there was a ruling\nby the court: I hereby declare a mistrial. I suppose\nyou could have an objection, but it would be very -- the\njury was present when the judge said: I hereby declare\nthe mistrial.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it would be rather\nawkward for the counsel at that is point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was\nno pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and\nthe court then said immediately afterward: The jury is\ndismissed. So there was no interval for an objection?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it would be\ndifficult for counsel to object at that point, but I\nstill think counsel could have made a record immediately\nat that point.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would it have been\ndifficult? Why would it be difficult for counsel to\nsay, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't\nthink that there should be a mistrial, I think you\nshould ask the jury to deliberate further?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, that is possible and\nthat as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial\ncourt -- this is a circuit court -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you make of the\nfact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor\nacknowledged that the judge made a mistake?\nMR. McGORMLEY: In Michigan confessions of\nerror are controlled by court rule as a procedural\nmatter, and the appellate courts have the ability to\naccept statements that could be qualified as a\nconfession of error or not. Here the Michigan Supreme\nCourt addressed this case on the merits, the underlying\ndouble jeopardy merits. In much the same way, it did\nnot address potential waiver or consent issues by the\ndefendant. So we have a merits opinion here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are thousands and\nthousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are\nnot all that unusual. So in this case we have testimony\ngoing on for 4 days, 10 hours total. And we have jury\ndeliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very\nlittle -- I think you can argue it both ways that the\njury was deadlocked. There are some things for, some\nagainst, only a couple.\nAnd he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all\nright. Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases\nthat must be there over the decades, you probably looked\nthrough a few or at least talked to your fellow bar\nmembers. How many have you found where you would say\nthat a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on\nyour side? In other words, there are going to be\nmillions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of\nthem will support the defense. Maybe many support you.\nBut I haven't seen any here that say they support you.\nSo how many do? And what do you want me to read to see\nthat this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse\nof the judge's discretion? How many did you find which\nwill prove to me this is not, this is closer to the\nnorm?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, the difficult part in\nanswering Your Honor's question is that this Court has\nindicated that there is no mechanical formula or test.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. That's why I am\nasking the question. What they've said is, is it an\nabuse of discretion? And they've also said the judge\nhas to be careful. Okay, so we have like an abuse of\ndiscretion scale and this is pretty far over on the\nabuse of discretion side. I think anyone would admit.\nBut what cases will show to me that it's on your side,\nnot quite an abuse of discretion? Or is this the most\nextreme case in history?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I don't believe it is, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you don't believe\nit. All I want you to do is to give me some evidence,\nlike refer me to some other cases or explain to me how\nyou have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of\nthis case, but looking on the scale.\nMR. McGORMLEY: I reach that conclusion by\nlooking at this Court's other language, for instance -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to look at\nthis Court. We don't have a case where we said what was\nan abuse of discretion. I want you to tell me -- and\nI've already said this twice, but I am judging from your\nanswer you found no case supporting it. You have found\nno case in the history of the United States that was\nmore extreme than this -\nMR. McGORMLEY: I have not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where they said it\nwasn't an abuse of discretion. That's what I'm judging\nfrom your answer.\nMR. McGORMLEY: I have not found a case on\nthese facts with a note indicating acrimonious\ndeliberations, that is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no note\nindicating. There are five, there are notes they sent\nout, and at 9:30 in the morning they said: Judge, we\nhave a concern about our voice levels, disturbing.\nThat's what they said. Then they asked to see the\nevidence and they said: Explain Count 2.\nThen they said: Are we allowed to break?\nAnd then they said: What if we can't agree? Mistrial,\nretrial, what? And at 12:27, the same time, they said:\nWhat about lunch?\nThen he brought them out and he says to the\njuror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly\ndeadlocked? And the foreperson said: The majority of\nus don't believe that. And he said: Don't say what\nyou're going to say. And then he doesn't have the\nlawyer there.\nOkay, that's fairly extreme. So that's why\nI ask the question.\nMR. McGORMLEY: But the reference there\nabout don't say what you're going to say is likely a\nreference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McGormley, is it your\nburden to answer that question? Given AEDPA, is it up\nto you to show that this case is within the mainstream\nor is it up to the other side to show rather\nconclusively that it is not in the mainstream? I\nthought that's what AEDPA required.\nMR. McGORMLEY: It is Petitioner's burden.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is Petitioner's burden\nto show that there are cases like this, where I guess to\nshow that uniformly in cases like this, there is no\ndischarge of the jury. And I'm not aware that they have\ncarried that burden. But we will ask when they come up.\nIt is their burden, however.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly but I'm drawing\nsome conclusions from your silence. You haven't found a\ncase supporting it?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I haven't found a case on\nthese facts, but that's consistent -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have you found any case\nwhere a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring\nwith counsel, where the declaration was upheld?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Actually, there's one out of\nthe Sixth Circuit, Klein v. Leis, from this very\ncircuit, in which the individual -- it was not a\ndeadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort\nof stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted\nit up, and the trial court -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well you can't read from\nthat one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was\nheld, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of\nimproper prejudicial actions during the trial.\nMR. McGORMLEY: But that's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are different\nquestions.\nMR. McGORMLEY: But it's still a manifest\nnecessity determination. In fact, this Court has\nindicated that on the spectrum of reasons a deadlocked\njury warrants the least amount of appellate scrutiny.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- yes, but\nthat doesn't mean none.\nWhat -- other than we have cases where\njudges have declared mistrials because they are going on\nvacation. Those are easy, okay?\nBut somewhere the word \"abuse of discretion\"\nmeans that someone has discretion, but is improperly\nexercising it. What facts would it take for you to\nbelieve that that would have been the case? What do you\nhave to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -\nthat would have been an abuse of discretion? What\npoint? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that\nwould be enough, right? Or would it?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, to best answer Your\nHonor's question, I would point out again that in\nArizona this Court mentioned that examples being of\nabuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned\nare when the trial court acts irrationally,\nirresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons. And in our\nyellow brief we cited several cases where I would say\nthe Court was correct to find an abuse of discretion -\nthe Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary\nindication. The jury in the Starling case indicated\nthat, we are making progress and in fact can we have 15\nmore minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares\na mistrial.\nYour Honor's example then with the Gordy\ncase would be the imminent travel plans and docket\nconsiderations.\nWe also have where the court acts sua\nsponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the\ntrial court -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that this one,\nmeaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked,\nhopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict. It\nasks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson\nhasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or\nnot as a group they believe they are hopelessly\ndeadlocked. Why isn't this precipitous action?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, again, as I -- as I\nmentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that\nit is indicative of acrimony. It's a reasonable view of\nthe second note that it was indicative of a deadlock.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But again, that's --that's\nnot your burden. We are operating here under a statute\nwhich says: \"In a proceeding instituted by an\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in\ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a\ndetermination of a factual issue made by a State court\nshall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall\nhave the burden of rebutting the presumption of\ncorrectness by clear and convincing evidence.\"\nNow, what is the factual\ndetermination that has been made here? I assume it's\nthe factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.\nMR. McGORMLEY: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that has to be rebutted\nby clear and convincing evidence, correct?\nMR. McGORMLEY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you answer that\nto those questions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the status of\nthe -- the Allen charge in Michigan? Has Michigan taken\na position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible\nthing for a trial court to do?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, a -- Michigan has\nadopted the ABA standard. Michigan has the Instruction\n3.12. It's not what we would call the traditional Allen\ndynamite charge because it's not asking the minority to\ngive credence to the majority's opinion. So there is a\ndeadlocked jury instruction in Michigan. It's not the\ntraditional Allen dynamite charge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that wasn't\nrequested, either?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, that was not -- that\nwas not done here. But again, I think it's reasonable,\nunderstanding that this is a dual -- dual-layered\ndeference case, being a habeas case as well as the trial\ncourt being -- having broad discretion to make this\ndetermination, that when you have -- have the notes -- I\nmean, it -- it may tell the -- the trial court may have\nfelt that giving an Allen charge when there's acrimony\nmay be telling those minority jurors that it doesn't\nmatter and that they may have to submit to the majority\nopinion.\nSo I believe it was -- it was reasonable for\nthe Michigan Supreme Court here, applying AEDPA to -- to\nconclude that the -- the trial court acted in\nconformance with this -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you as a matter\nof Michigan practice, could the trial judge have\ninterrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and\nasked them what they thought about whether there was a\ndeadlock?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I believe that is\npermissible, though not constitutionally required.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any reason -- do\nyou suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I believe -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She.\nMR. McGORMLEY: -- she, the trial judge -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He took the view of the\nforeman, an answer to one question, and that was it; is\nthat right?\nMR. McGORMLEY: The -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: His conclusion that there\nwas a deadlock was based on one question and one answer\nof one of the jurors, and that was the whole record\nsupporting his decision; is that right?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Respectfully, no, Your\nHonor. I believe it was based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, including the two previous notes and a\nbifurcated question where -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what other\ncircumstance is relevant? The fact that they raised\ntheir voices during deliberation, certainly that -- that\ndoesn't cut any ice either way, does it?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well -- oh, I believe it\ndoes, because this Court has indicated in Arizona\nthat -- that acrimony is a concern. It's a\ncountervailing concern to balancing the interest of the\ndefendant having his case decided by a single tribunal\nand fair and just judgments, as well as society having\none fair opportunity to vindicate its laws. So I think\nit's very much an appropriate consideration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McGormley, what\nevidence was there to the effect that the jury was not\ndeadlocked?\nMR. McGORMLEY: None.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is presumably what\nthe other side has to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the\nState court.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Correct. That's why it's\nimperative to view this case in the habeas box that it\nresides. And that is the Michigan Supreme Court made\nreasonable factual determinations and did not\nobjectively unreasonably apply this Court's precedent.\nAnd the fact that we may look at these notes and go one\nway or the other means that the State wins. The State\nshould prevail, because it's a reasonable interpretation\nof those notes. If one person may say, I don't know\nthat that really indicates deadlock and the Michigan\nSupreme Court is looking at it and it's a reasonable\ndetermination, then deference should apply and the State\nshould prevail.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McGormley, do we have\nany indication how long this trial judge was on the\nbench when this trial came up?\nMR. McGORMLEY: How long in terms of serving\non the bench?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. McGORMLEY: My recollection is that this\nwas an experienced trial judge who then went to either\ncivil arena from recorder's court or retired. So I\nbelieve this was an experienced trial. I don't have the\nexact years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Acrimony, I recognize we\nhave talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it\ncould be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder\ncount and they were just quarrelling over whether they\nshould add the firearms count, or the other way around.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it -- it gets\nback to that fundamental -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In which case they would\nbe much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony\nmight indicate.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, it gets back to the\nfundamental principle that the trial court should be\nable to take -- now, this is on the second, but the\ninitial layer of deference -- that the trial court\nshould be able to take the foreperson at her word when\nshe says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is\ndeadlocked, especially -- especially in light of\nthese -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't say, can you,\nthat every time the jury records that it can't reach a\nverdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that\nthat's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I do not assert that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So obviously the word\n\"deadlock,\" and as I read the judge's questions, he\ndefined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict.\nAnd later he uses \"hopelessly deadlocked,\" but changes\nthe question when he asks the foreperson to respond.\nIsn't there a difference between hopelessly,\ni.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a\nverdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, I guess I don't quite\nsee the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I\nthink hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher\nstandard than -- than genuinely deadlocked.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That isn't what the judge\nsaid just before she got the response. She said: Are\nyou going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Right. It's a bifurcated\nquestion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the foreperson said:\nNo, judge.\nMR. McGORMLEY: It's a bifurcated question,\ncorrect. I mean, the -- the first one was regarding\nconfirming the nature of their note, and then, even with\nthe interruption, there are -- twice the court\napproaches this inability to reach a unanimous verdict.\nSo again, here, what is paramount is that\nit's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively\nunreasonably apply this Court's clearly established\nprecedent. There -- there is no case that flatly\ncontrols this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard.\nIn fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own\nthree-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when\nthey said that there are three considerations that\ndetermine.\nSo when you take that three-part test, which\nis not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well\nas the second-guessing of those predicate factual\ndeterminations being, well, the jury probably didn't\nhave enough time to even review the witnesses, juries\noften report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as\nmuch weight to this foreperson's statement, it's\ncontrary to these dual layers of deference.\nAnd if there are no further questions, may I\nreserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. -- Ms. McCowan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARLA R. McCOWAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. McCOWAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHabeas relief was properly granted. I would\nlike to first answer Justice Ginsburg's somewhat easy\nquestion for me. Judge Brown was sworn into service on\nJanuary 1st of 1991. At the time of this trial she had\nbeen on the bench approximately 6-1/2 years. We are not\ndisputing her experience as a trial judge.\nI do disagree with my friend's contention\nthat the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test.\nWhat the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some\nconsiderations or some guidelines, including the first\nof which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions\nof the parties. And that does go a long way, Justice\nKennedy, toward the idea that the judge is exercising\nsound discretion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would\nbe gained from that? I -- the parties, one says -\nlet's say one says yes and the other says no. You ought\nto grant a mistrial, you shouldn't.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, at the very least, it\nevidences that the trial judge at least considered that\nthere were -- that there competing interests and -- and\ndebated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an\nextraordinarily drastic remedy.\nAnd instead, our position is that there\nreally is no down side to talking with counsel. You\nwould be able to have the benefit of the parties'\narguments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do people usually -\nin your experience is there usually a clear breakdown\nbetween prosecution and defense on a question like this?\nMy perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if\nthey have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to\ncontinue, because all they need is, you` know, one\nholdout.\nMS. McCOWAN: My -- my experience -- there\nis a range of things that are going on. I'm sorry, I\ncan't -- I -- I think it just -- it just depends on a\nvariety of the circumstances. But yes, I think that the\ncase law generally presumes that the defendant does want\nthe first jury to deliberate to verdict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are\n-- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the\nonly question for us is whether it was an abuse of\ndiscretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge\nhere.\nThat would certainly be the case if this is\ncoming up through the Federal system and we had a\nFederal trial judge who had made this determination, but\nit is not. It -- it is coming up from a State court and\nCongress enacted a statute designed specifically to\nreduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with\nState justice. And that statute says specifically that\nwhere there has been a factual finding by the State\ncourt, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal\ncourts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing\nevidence.\nNow, what clear and convincing evidence is\nthere here that there was not a deadlocked jury?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, first, I am not sure\nthat I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with\nthe premise that -- that there was a factual finding by\nthe trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked.\nThe judge acquired or extracted the \"no\" answer and then\nimmediately declared a mistrial. The ruling that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what was the basis\nfor that declaration of mistrial?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, presumably on these\nfacts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that\nthe jury was deadlocked.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. McCOWAN: But there is no actual\nspecific ruling. And instead, what we are focused here\non is the Michigan Supreme Court's determination that\nthere was manifest necessity, and in the absence of the\ntrial judge exercising sound discretion, there is no -\nthe reason for the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Michigan Supreme\nCourt's determination is simply a determination of the\nsame fact: There was a manifest necessity because the\njury was deadlocked.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, my -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that factfinding is\nimplicit not -- not only in what the trial court did,\nbut also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.\nMS. McCOWAN: My understanding of manifest\nnecessity is that that was a legal determination by the\nMichigan Supreme Court, that there was -- according to\nthis Court's precedent, there was manifest necessity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the jury is\nhopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that\nwould not constitute manifest necessity?\nMS. McCOWAN: Typically, a genuinely and\nhopelessly deadlocked jury does constitute -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it does get back\nto the factual determination of deadlock, correct?\nMS. McCOWAN: Generally, yes -- yes, I\nbelieve so. But in -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Michigan Supreme Court\ncited four factors in support of its decision: the\nlength of the deliberations in relation to the\ncomplexity of the case, the heated discussions among the\njurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson\nsaid that the jury would not be able to reach a\nunanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no\nobjection by defense counsel.\nIs there any decision in this Court that\nsays that under -- that in a case in which those four\nfactors are present, that the trial judge may not grant\na mistrial?\nMS. McCOWAN: No, there are no specific\nrequirements.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- could you\ngive us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding\nthat in a case where those four factors are present, a\ntrial judge may not grant a mistrial?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, no. But the law does\nstill require that the judge exercise sound discretion\nin -- in making a determination that there -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The question is when those\nfour factors are present, why are they not sufficient to\nestablish that the judge was exercising sound\ndiscretion? Unless there is a decision of this Court or\nperhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying\nthat, no, even when those four factors are present you\nmay not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the\nconclusion that you are asking us to draw?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I under -- I think\nI understand the question. I do -- I do recognize that\nthere are no specific requirements, and that in the\nabsence of that, that there is nothing specific that the\ntrial judge was required to do beyond the exercise of\nsound discretion. And in this case the judge -- the\nrecord does not support that the judge did exercise\nsound discretion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So can -- what -- what\nis -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the\nquestion I asked your colleague on the other side, if\nyou can remember it? I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on\nthe scale. I mean, this is a fairly simple case.\nMS. McCOWAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is wonderful about\nthis case is there is no disagreement about the facts.\nWe could write them in under two pages, just quoting\nexactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and\nnote that the lawyer wasn't there. So there we are.\nNow, imagine that in front of you. You -\nit's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for\nhim, because you want to find reversals, and all you\nhave to do is you look and you try to see when the State\ncourts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest\nnecessity.\nSo I have some time. I will read some\ncases. Which ones do you want me to read? And I don't\nneed to read the standard. I have the standard. And I\ndon't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation\nof the statute; you have the burden. And the question\nis we have a record of those two pages, and does it\nclearly show that he abused his discretion when he said\nthere was manifest necessity? Now, I will read -\nwhatever cases you tell me to read, I will read. But I\nwant to find facts and I'm not sure you found some,\neither.\nMS. McCOWAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nI -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How could it be that there\nare no cases? I mean really, thousands and thousands of\nmistrials?\nMS. McCOWAN: Indeed, there -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How can it be that there\nare no cases? Are reversals very, very rare for\nmanifest necessity?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I -- I did\nundertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I\ndid not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find\nanything that looks even remotely as bad as this.\nNow -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's good. Now, tell\nme then what did you find? When you say \"remotely as\nbad,\" then you perhaps found some where contention was\nrejected, or where contention -- what did you find?\nWhat did you find by way of cases where they said on\nfacts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there\nwas no manifest necessity?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I guess the short answer\nis that --- that there was nothing exactly on point. I\nmean, there were -- there were cases where the judge\nacted abruptly and hastily and then there were cases\nwhere the judge did consider the -- the options of the\nparties.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the\nproposition that what happened here is an abuse of\ndiscretion cannot be said to be clearly established,\nright?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I don't think that it\nhas to be established at -- at a granular level. This\nCourt does require still that the -- that the trial\njudge exercise sound discretion in making the\ndetermination that there was manifest necessity. And\nthe case law -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have\nanything like this case that says this would be an abuse\nof discretion?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I do believe that\nthis case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a\nplurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge\nacted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to\nthe parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a\nmistrial; was acting irrationality, irresponsibly -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that\nit's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly\nestablished by the decisions of this Court.\nMS. McCOWAN: But in Arizona v. Washington\nthis Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the\ntrial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and\nprecipitously, that their action -- that their ruling\nwill not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion\nrequires that the trial judge act carefully and\ndeliberately.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But our -- but our cases\nhave required much -- much more than that, much more\nthan referring to a generalized standard that our\nopinions have set forth. They have required proving\nthat the application of that standard in our opinions\ncomports with the provision of the statute that requires\nyou to show that the claim resulted in a decision that\nwas contrary to or involved in unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\nNow, our cases don't show that you can\nsimply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of\ndiscretion standard, that was clearly established by the\nSupreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I\nhave to show is that this is an abuse of discretion. I\ndon't think so. I think our cases show you have to show\nthat the standard as applied by our cases does not cover\nyour situation. And you don't have any cases like that.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I do understand -- well,\nI guess the best answer that I have for that is that,\nwhy there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I\ndon't know, but what I -- what I came up with or\ntheorized is that I think that for the most part trial\ncourts understand that this is a tremendous obligation\nthat they must exercise sound discretion. And for the\nmost part for 186 years this has pretty much worked.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be. That may well\nbe -\nMS. McCOWAN: And there's nothing -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which says it's a\nterrible statute, but there it is. It says it has to be\ncontrary to clearly established Federal law as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\nAnd you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established\nby an unbroken line of lower court decisions. That's\nnot what the statute says.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your -- your\nposition was that everybody agrees on what the law is:\nIf there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate. So\nthere is no question about that statement of the law.\nIt's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up\nuntil now we have been talking about this, including\nJustice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that\nis, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it quite correct\nto say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock?\nIsn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest\nnecessity to take the action? Isn't that the test?\nMS. McCOWAN: Precisely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the argument is that\nthere was not a manifest necessity shown, even though\nthere was disagreement about whether there was a\ndeadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike.\nMS. McCOWAN: Precisely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Some people think one -\nthere is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock. Some\npeople think it -- it might be more. I don't think the\ntest is deadlock. The test is manifest necessity.\nMS. McCOWAN: I agree.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you\nanswered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm\n-- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although\nI doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue\ndid come down to the factual determination of deadlock,\nbecause if there is deadlock then there is manifest\nnecessity.\nMS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. I though that,\nwhen I answered that question, that you were asking if\ntypically, if the jury is genuinely deadlocked, does\nthat constitute an example of manifest necessity? I'm\nsorry for the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the case\ncomes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine\ndeadlock, right?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, no, I believe that the\ncase ultimately comes down to -- I am sorry if I\nmisspoke before. I believe that the case ultimately\ncomes down to whether the Michigan Supreme Court\nunreasonably applied this Court's precedent in finding\nthat the trial judge exercised -- that there was\nmanifest necessity in the absence of the trial judge\nexercising sound discretion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With the layers -\nwith the two layers of deference worked into your\nformulation. It's not simply whether the trial court\nerred in the determination that there was a deadlock\nthat constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not\nthere was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial\njudge to so determine that we review under an additional\nabuse of discretion standard.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, my understanding of 2254\nis that it does take into consideration the contours of\nthe underlying constitutional violation, and it still is\nour position that if the -- if the trial judge was not\nexercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be\nobjectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court\nto have found that, that that is necessarily\ncontemplated by 2254.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't our law\nclearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears\nthe burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if\nthere is an absence of evidence supporting that burden,\nhasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer\nto the case?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, that certainly sounds\nfair. I don't want to quibble, but I think that the -\nmy understanding of the law is that when -- when there\nis an objection by the defense, then the burden is on\nthe prosecution. In this case, there was no opportunity\nto object. So I'm not sure that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that -- why is\nthat so? If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was\n11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been\nreluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the\ngranting of a mistrial?\nMS. McCOWAN: I think, yes, practically -\npractically speaking, I think he probably would have\nbeen reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a\nFriday afternoon and the judge has essentially released\nthem for the day.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What does he have to lose\nat that point? She has made the ruling and that's that\nthere is going to be a mistrial. The lawyer at that\npoint can say: Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I\nwould like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen\ncharge. Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I think just as a\npractical matter, having the jury hear that the defense\ndoes not want the jury to leave, the potential for\nprejudice would be tremendous. And as a practical\nmatter, I think that the parties would have been\nreluctant to do that. And I think -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you really saying that?\nYou're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a\nclient who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1\nfor acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to\nhave a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the\nwindow, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say:\nJudge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar\nand object to the granting of a mistrial?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure how we\n-- we would know on these facts that the jury was 11-to\n1 for acquittal.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not suggesting\nthat they were or they weren't. I'm just asking about\nwhat defense counsel would do in that situation. Maybe\nthey are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm\nfamiliar with. I would think that they would not be\nhesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was\ngoing to prejudice the client.\nMS. McCOWAN: I certainly would hope so as\nwell. But here I think that it was all just done just\nso fast and without warning and truly without any\nopportunity to object. And so for that reason, I -- I\nthink that the lack of objection really doesn't do\nanything to fortify the conclusion that there was\nmanifest necessity in these facts. Instead -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what -- I'm\nsorry. Please finish your sentence.\nMS. McCOWAN: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. What other\nexplanation is there for a note saying \"Are we being too\nloud,\" other than that there was some degree of acrimony\non the jury?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, I don't think that the\nMichigan Supreme Court even made a specific finding that\nthe jury had become -- had completely devolved at that\npoint and they were no longer -- I think that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you don't\ndispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we\nbeing too loud?\nMS. McCOWAN: Not at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would\nthat indicate other than that there was some degree of\nacrimony?\nMS. McCOWAN: I think it just also indicates\nthey maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and\nthey want to make sure that they are not being\noverheard, and that, you know, they have some privacy in\ntheir deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage\nin a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be.\nI don't think that there is -- I mean, I\nsuppose what I'm trying to say, however inartfully, is\nthat I don't think we can do anything other than just\ntake that note at face value. They send out a note\nsaying: We have a concern that our voice levels may be\ndisturbing the other proceedings. That's it. It did\nnot -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe that's right\nand maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that\nit was evidence of acrimony, which it could be. And you\nsay: Well, it also couldn't be. That may well be. But\nwe are bound to accept the factual determination of the\nState court, unless you can show by clear and convincing\nevidence that that's wrong.\nMS. McCOWAN: I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe\nI am just not understanding the Michigan Supreme Court\nopinion, but I don't know that they actually made a\nfinding that that was, in fact, evidence of acrimony.\nI thought that the Michigan Supreme Court\nsaid that may indicate that they perhaps had become -\nthat the deliberations had become acrimonious. And I -\nand I think that that's a credible point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your time. I\nwill look for it.\nMS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your argument\ntime. I will look for it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is no\ncase in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly\nidentical facts, so this is not under the \"contrary to\"\nprong of 24 -- of 2254(d)(1).\nSo it has to be under the \"unreasonable\napplication.\" Particularly for me, what Supreme Court\nprecedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and\nexplain how and why?\nMS. McCOWAN: I think Arizona v. Washington\nclearly establishes the law that the trial judge must\nexercise sound discretion in finding a manifest\nnecessity. And in this case, on these facts, it was\nobjectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court\nto have found that there was manifest necessity in the\nabsence of any discretion being exercised whatsoever by\nthe trial judge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in that case, one of\nthe specific factors was that he consulted with -- the\njudge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?\nMS. McCOWAN: In this case, that he -- that\nthe trial judge failed?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in Arizona.\nMS. McCOWAN: Oh, right. In -- right,\nexactly. In Arizona v. Washington, what this Court had\nfound is that -- that the judge did exercise discretion;\nthat was -- that was evidenced by the judge giving the\nparties an opportunity to weigh in on it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a little shaky as\nprecedent for -- that -- that was a case that said: The\ntrial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new\ntrial. But in passing, to get there, the Court said:\nWell, this case didn't involve that. But the Court\nisn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in\nthat case didn't violate defendant's right.\nMS. McCOWAN: But I thought that this Court\ndid say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial\njudge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion,\nand a review in court must satisfy itself that, in\naccordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact\nexercise sound discretion in finding that there was\nmanifest necessity.\nAnd I think that this case looks different\nfrom Washington and may be similar to what was going on\nin Jorn, where the judge acted without warning, without\nany opportunity for the parties to weigh in on the\nmatter, and simply declared a mistrial, which this Court\nfound to be irrational, irresponsible, and precipitous.\nAnd we -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So are you suggesting that\nwhenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in\ngranting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA?\nIt is clearly established that whenever there is an\nabuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA.\nIt is an unreasonable application of our precedent?\nMS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. Just to clarify.\nYou are saying if the trial judge abused -- in fact\nabuses his discretion?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMS. McCOWAN: Yes. I think that if the\nMichigan -- on these facts, for the Michigan Supreme\nCourt to have found that there -- that there was\nmanifest necessity in the absence of the judge\nexercising any discretion whatsoever, that that was in\nfact, an unreasonable application of this Court's\nprecedent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the standard of review\nfor setting aside a determination of the State Supreme\nCourt is exactly the same as the standard of review for\nreviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court\nof appeals despite AEDPA? We simply look and see\nwhether there has been an abuse of discretion. If there\nhas, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?\nMS. McCOWAN: No, I'm sorry. To clarify, it\nstill has to be whether -- we are looking at the\nMichigan Supreme Court's decision here. We are in -- on\nhabeas, you are looking at the last reasoned State\ncourt's opinion.\nAnd if the State supreme court -- the last\nreasoned court opinion says -- makes an objectively\nunreasonable determination, under this Court's clearly\nestablished precedent then relief will be warranted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's objectively\nunreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse\nof discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, if the trial judge does\nnot exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts\nirrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I\nbelieve that relief would be warranted, even under\nhabeas review.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not just abuse of\ndiscretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something\nelse? Plus what?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, it's -- it's whether the\nMichigan -- whether the -- the decision under review,\nwhether it was an objectively unreasonable determination\nof this Court's precedent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you do\nagree that there could be situations where a Federal\ncourt on direct review would find abuse of discretion,\nand yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that\nthat has to stand?\nMS. McCOWAN: Yes. And I want to clarify.\nI think my understanding is that it's not just whether\nthis Court disagrees. It does still has to be an\nobjectively unreasonable determination. So it's not\njust simply whether -- whether this Court or any habeas\ncourt reviewing it would come to a different conclusion.\nIt still has to be objectively unreasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there are a\ncategory of cases where a Federal court could look at it\nand say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same\ncourt reviewing it under habeas would say you are not\nentitled to relief under AEDPA?\nMS. McCOWAN: I think that that is right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But \"objectively\nunreasonable\" is already built into the criterion of\nabuse of discretion. You don't abuse your discretion if\nwhat you have done is reasonable, you know, within the\nballpark. It seems to me you are doubling up here.\nI -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, our argument is that the\ntrial court was not in the ballpark here. The trial\ncourt in this case did not exercise any discretion\nwhatsoever, let alone sound discretion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you say\nthat? I mean, you may think the discretion was abused,\nbut it's not like he just suddenly announced there was\ngoing to be a mistrial. He exercised discretion. He\nlooked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are\nyou hopelessly deadlocked? Are you going to be able to\nreach a unanimous verdict?\nAnd he was able to rely on the fact that\nthey had previously sent out a note saying, are we being\ntoo loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in\nwhich there were 10 hours of testimony.\nI mean, I understand your argument that he\nabused his discretion, but I don't understand the\nargument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, my -- my argument is\nthat the judge was not exercising sound discretion\nbecause she was not responsibly gathering the facts.\nShe reached the conclusion that the jury was genuinely\ndeadlocked before she even asked a single question. She\ngot a -- a note from the jury -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, she asked the\nforeperson a question.\nMS. McCOWAN: But if I could just back up a\ncouple lines, she received the note saying: What if we\ncan't agree. And she said: I have to conclude from\nthat, that that is your situation at this time.\nSo she had already reached the conclusion\nthat they were deadlocked before even asking a single\nquestion. And then from there she -- she misdefines,\nfor lack of a better description -- she conflated mere\ndisagreement with deadlock, never corrected that -\nthat -- that erroneous definition. And she corralled\nthe -- the foreperson in a matter of seconds -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where did -- where\ndid -- I'm sorry. Where did she conflate the two things\nyou said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing?\nWhat was it, inability to -\nMS. McCOWAN: I'm in the petition appendix\nat page 94a, where she says -- I'm sorry; at the bottom\nof 93a. She said: \"I need to ask if the jury is\ndeadlocked? In other words, is there a disagreement as\nto the verdict?\"\nDisagreement is not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you got to\nread down further. She says: \"Are you going to reach a\nunanimous verdict or not?\" And the foreperson says\n\"No.\"\nMS. McCOWAN: But in the absence of an\nexpression of deadlock from the entire jury, on these\nfacts in this case, it was unreasonable for the Michigan\nSupreme Court to find that that satisfied the trial\njudge's obligation to exercise sound discretion. At a\nminimum, the trial judge is required to responsively\ngather the facts.\nIn this case, she -- she acted hastily and\nprecipitously and without regard for my client's right\nto have this first jury deliberate to a verdict. She\ndeclared a mistrial at the very first sign of\ndisagreement and did not give anybody an opportunity to\nweigh in on that before she declared -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- with\nrespect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement.\nReasonably interpreting, a note saying \"Are we being too\nloud\" is a sign of disagreement. And there is another\nnote that comes out: \"What happens if we can't agree?\"\nYou are making it sound more precipitous than it was.\nMS. McCOWAN: Well -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Also you are ignoring the\nfact the first time the question was asked, do you\nbelieve it was hopelessly deadlocked and the foreperson\nsaid the majority of us don't believe that. And then\nlater -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no. I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and there is a period,\nin the opinion of the supreme court after we don't\nbelieve that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is not a\nperiod on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief. Is that a\nmistake? There's a -\nMS. McCOWAN: I thought there was a dash.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- dash. And -- and\ncould the court be concerned that the person was about\nto say, and again with deference to the court, \"The\nmajority -- majority of us don't believe that\" -- that\nthe defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent.\nWasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?\nMS. McCOWAN: Well, it may be correct to\nstop her right there, but there is other ways to figure\nout exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain.\nAnd if she was trying to say, well, the majority of us\nthink we can keep going, then it was -- it was incumbent\nupon the trial judge to -- to do more.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that exactly\nwhat she did? After that he says don't tell me what you\nare going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to\nsay. I don't want to know what your verdict might be or\nhow the split is or anything like that, are you going to\nreach a unanimous verdict? She did go on after that -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The foreperson did not\nimmediately answer. She had to ask a second question,\nyes or no. And the foreperson answered for herself but\nnot necessarily for the jury when she said no.\nMS. McCOWAN: I think that's right. And I\nthink -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how do you\nknow she answered for herself? The judge was talking -\nshe can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself. She is\nanswering for the jury.\nMS. McCOWAN: I -- I think that really at\nbest, though -- given the circumstances of this case, at\nbest that was an expression of the foreperson's opinion,\nthat the jury would not likely be able -- but that is\nnot a statement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you always have to poll\nthe jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement?\nMS. McCOWAN: No, it's not -- it's not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am not aware that you\nwould always have to poll the jury, and I could see some\nreal disadvantages to it as a matter of fact. It\nperhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the\nholdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the\nholdouts. I'm not aware that that's a requirement.\nMS. McCOWAN: It's certainly not a\nrequirement and we were not saying that it is a\nrequirement. But on these facts when the jury has\nsimply sent the foreperson out to gather more\ninformation, the trial judge was required to, in some\nway, either -- either assure itself that the -- that the\njury as a whole did agree with the foreperson's\nexpression -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't think it's a fair\ninference from the note that the jury was stuck? Do you\nthink it's -- it's likely that they were just curious\nand they were rolling along just fine, but they were\njust curious, well, what if it happens after we\ndeliberated a little more if we can't reach a -- a\nverdict? We just have a curiosity about that? Do you\nthink that's a fair inference from that note?\nMS. McCOWAN: I think all that is fair is\nthat they were just trying to gather more information.\nAnd that they -- but there is no -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't think there's\nan -- you can draw an inference fairly that they were -\nthat there was substantial disagreement?\nMS. McCOWAN: No, I don't think that that\nnecessarily means that there is substantial\ndisagreement. They might have been having trouble.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. McCowan.\nMr. McGormley, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McGORMLEY: Thank you. Two brief\npoints. It is a Petitioner's burden to establish -\nclearly establish precedent here that was objectively -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean Respondent,\nright?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I'm sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are -- you are\nthe Petitioner.\nMR. McGORMLEY: I'm sorry, it -- it -- I'm\nsorry, Mr. Lett -- Mr. Lett's burden to demonstrate that\nthere is clearly established precedent that was\nobjectively and unreasonably applied.\nTo Justice Breyer, your question although\nnot exact fact patterns and that is what I was\nstruggling with, I would point in our blue brief to\nHernandez-Guardado and Lindsay v. Smith, two cases in\nwhich -- circuit cases, granted, but two cases in which\ninvolved jury deadlocks and counsel was not asked a\nquestion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And those are the ones -\nso as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated.\nYou know, it's pretty clear what the standard is. The\nstandard is, was the decision of the -- of the State\ncourt reasonable in deciding that there was a sound -\nsound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's -\nthat's, you know, like 100 years ago or something.\nMR. McGORMLEY: 186.\nJUSTICE BREYER: 186 years ago when it was\nsomething like \"sound, careful, exercise patience\" -- or\nwhatever, \"the sound, careful exercise of discretion.\"\nThey said there was. And the question for us is, was\nthat reasonable? Okay? I guess if the judge had said,\n\"Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and\nthe game starts in five minutes, I've got to get\nthere -- dismissed,\" that would be unreasonable.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Objectively unreasonable.\nSo come as close as you can to that, where they held\nreasonable, and what case is it?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McGormley, you have\nstressed throughout that it's not -- not the question\nthat Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have\nemphasized the two screens. This comes to us after we\nhave the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme\nCourt ruling. So the case isn't all that easy, without\nmaking the judgment as though it were coming up in the\nFederal system.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Correct, Justice Ginsburg,\nthis is not a very easy -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, do you\nthink the most relevant precedent from this Court -\nwould you agree that the most relevant precedent from\nthis Court is Arizona v. Washington?\nMR. McGORMLEY: I would not. And I -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMR. McGORMLEY: The reason why, Justice\nStevens, is because Arizona was not even a deadlocked\njury case. And there is language that helps flesh out\nwhat an abuse of discretion would be.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think the most\nrelevant precedent from this Court is?\nMR. McGORMLEY: Perez.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have an\nanswer to Justice Breyer's question? It was sometime\nago, but -\n(Laughter. )\nMR. McGORMLEY: My best answer, Justice\nBreyer, is that the best cases I have are -- are\nthose -- are those two, because this -- this Court has\nnever overruled a manifest necessity determination due\nto a deadlocked jury.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting that\nyou need a precedent overruling a lower court decision\nbefore we could declare that something was\nunreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably\napplied?\nMR. McGORMLEY: No, my point is that -- is\nin the 186 years since Perez it's never happened. It\ndoes not happen. And that is consistent with the broad\ndiscretion and special respect -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that could also be\nconsistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough\nthat judges have to act slowly and --and with thought,\nand that lower courts are catching those when they are\nnot. I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm\nsaying.\nMR. McGORMLEY: Well, I -- I think it is\nindicative of the fact that this has never happened -\nthis has never happened before.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
