        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 00-1187, David R. McKune v. Robert G. Lile.\nMr. McAllister.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nChoices have consequences, but they nonetheless\nremain choices. The mere withdrawal of prison privileges\nsuch as a personal television or how much an inmate may\nspend at the canteen, privileges which are not part of an\ninmate's sentence and to which an inmate has no legal\nentitlement, does not amount to constitutional compulsion\nin violation of the Fifth Amendment, certainly not when\nthe reason for the withdrawal of those privileges is the\ninmate's failure to comply with an unquestionably\nlegitimate treatment requirement that he accept\nresponsibility for his offenses.\nQUESTION: The problem, though, is he's forced,\nin effect, to confront the treatment possibility. It's\nnot an option. I mean, the tough part of the case for me,\nI think, is the fact that this is not a scheme, as I\nunderstand the Federal scheme, in which the inmate says, I\nwant to take advantage of this treatment program. This is\na scheme in which the State says, you're going to take\nadvantage of it, and if you don't take advantage of it,\nincluding the admissions in the reports of other offenses,\nand so on, you're going to lose substantial privileges.\nThat, to me, is the tough part of the case.\nMR. McALLISTER: That's true, Justice Souter,\nand our program does differ from the Federal program in\nthat respect, but it is still a choice for Mr. Lile. He\ndoes not have to incriminate himself in any way. His\nrefusal to participate is not at all incriminating, and\nwhat we're talking about in terms of what he may lose here\nare really relatively mild incentives within the prison --\nQUESTION: I thought that the participation\nrequired the prisoner to describe previous offenses that\nhe may have been --\nMR. McALLISTER: If he participates.\nQUESTION: -- committed.\nMR. McALLISTER: If he participates.\nQUESTION: That he may have committed if he\nparticipates.\nMR. McALLISTER: Right, but what I'm saying is,\nif he simply refuses to participate, there's no\nincrimination whatsoever, nothing drawn from that. He\nsimply --\nQUESTION: But what happens if he refuses? Is\nhe put in a different type of confinement with different\nterms and conditions?\nMR. McALLISTER: He can be, yes, and he will\ncertainly, with our privilege incentive level system, as\nthe inmates work their way through they have more\nprivileges, and they're in the nature of how much they can\nspend at the canteen --\nQUESTION: Well, everybody goes in presumably at\nthe same level.\nMR. McALLISTER: They start at intake.\nQUESTION: You're screened, and you start at the\nsame level of control.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, the prisoner says no, I don't\nwant to participate in that program. Does that mean that\nhe stays in that opening level, or is he then potentially\nput in something even more severe than that?\nMR. McALLISTER: The Kansas regulations say, if\nan inmate is recommended for this treatment program and he\nrefuses, he goes from level 3 to level 1. Mr. Lile is at\nlevel 3 because when we adopted this incentive scheme\nseveral years ago we grandfathered in all the inmates at\nthe highest level, so we started them out with the level 3\nprivileges, which is the highest they can achieve in\nprison, and it was then theirs to lose by not complying\nwith rules and committing disciplinary infractions, and so\nforth, so he was at level 3, and when he refused to\nparticipate he then comes down to level 1.\nQUESTION: Is that where he is today?\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, he's actually not,\nbecause he got an injunction against -- in this case\nagainst actually carrying out this program.\nQUESTION: In the future --\nQUESTION: So is he still incarcerated?\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes, he is.\nQUESTION: And he's at level 3?\nMR. McALLISTER: Level 3, yes.\nQUESTION: In the future, what's at issue is not\nbeing deprived a benefit you already have, but of not\ngiving you benefits that you don't have?\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, I --\nQUESTION: I mean, the reason he's being chopped\ndown from 3 to 1 was that he was grandfathered.\nMR. McALLISTER: He was grandfathered in.\nQUESTION: But in the future, he would simply\nnot make it from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, if he didn't go\ninto the program?\nMR. McALLISTER: Very possibly. I mean, very\npossibly.\nQUESTION: Because there's been some dispute\nbetween you and the other side as to whether this is\nsimply the denial of a benefit or a punishment, and I'm\nnot sure there's a whole lot of difference, but --\nMR. McALLISTER: And in the context of the\nprison --\nQUESTION: -- for the grandfathered people it\nlooks more like a punishment, chopping him down to 1, but\nin the future, at least, he just doesn't get promoted from\n1 to 2 to 3.\nMR. McALLISTER: That's certainly a possibility,\nand one thing about --\nQUESTION: You say it's a possibility. I mean,\nI suppose it's always a possibility, but does the scheme\nfor those who are not grandfathered provide that they will\nnever yet be on the intake level if they are a sex\noffender and so on, unless they agree to this?\nMR. McALLISTER: No. They will progress, unless\nthey have other reasons that they're not, because what\nhappens with this program, it's an 18-month program. Our\ninmates are not even evaluated, typically, for release\nuntil they're 2 years from their scheduled release date,\nso anybody with a sentence of any length will go several\nyears in the system, working their way up if they're\ncomplying with what they're supposed to do.\nQUESTION: Well then, the only person that's\ngoing to be in the position that Justice Scalia described\nis the person who's been getting in trouble along the way\nand never does progress. The person, I take it, like this\npetitioner here is going to be in the same position as\nthis petitioner.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes, potentially, but in our\nview it doesn't matter in the prison, should not matter in\nthe prison context whether you view it as taking away a\nbenefit or not bestowing a benefit, because none of these\ninmates come in with an expectation to any of these\nprivileges.\nQUESTION: Could the -- Kansas do that -- this\nwith respect to a prisoner who's writing letters to the\neditor, to the newspaper, complaining about prison\nconditions? They say, well, this -- all this is\nprivileged. We don't have to give you anything. You have\nno --\nMR. McALLISTER: I think that's a different\ncase, and that probably takes the Court quickly to Turner,\nwhere the Court has addressed the --\nQUESTION: But why is the First Amendment\ndifferent from the Self-Incrimination Clause? I mean, if\nin the one case you can't disadvantage the person for\nexercising that constitutional right, why in the other\ncase can you? I mean --\nMR. McALLISTER: Two --\nQUESTION: -- you have the First Amendment --\nMR. McALLISTER: Two things, Justice Ginsburg.\nOne, we don't think we are disadvantaging here in terms of\nactually compelling him.\nQUESTION: But then you should say the same\nthing about the First Amendment. You're not taking away\nanything you're entitled to. You've no liberty interest,\nproperty interest, all that. If that follows, then what's\nwrong with saying --\nMR. McALLISTER: But in the First Amendment\ncontext he has a right, a free speech right or a right of\naccess to the courts that may be at issue. In this\ncontext, all the Fifth Amendment says is, no person shall\nbe compelled, so --\nQUESTION: As I recall it, the First Amendment\nsays -- speaks of abridgement --\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- right, and Fifth Amendment speaks\nof compulsion.\nMR. McALLISTER: Compulsion, that's the language\nin the amendment.\nQUESTION: I'm concerned about the same thing\nJustice Ginsburg is concerned -- I have to say I can't\nfind in our cases a statement that a burden on your -- or\nan unconstitutional condition which involves the Fifth\nAmendment is barred, but I'm wondering if it oughtn't to\nbe.\nIs it your -- it seems to me to follow from your\nposition that every prisoner in Kansas could be told,\neither you confess to the crime for which you've been\nconvicted and all other crimes you've committed or you go\nto maximum security for the rest of your time here.\nMR. McALLISTER: Not necessarily, Justice\nKennedy.\nQUESTION: Because I think the State does have\nan interest in saying, we want to rehabilitate you, and\nit's best for you to confront your wrong. Would you say\nthe statute, or the rule I've proposed is problematic? Is\nit different from what you're proposing?\nMR. McALLISTER: I think it's potentially\ndifferent, although it is potentially permissible\nconstitutionally, but the question would become, what sort\nof legitimate valid penological interest do we have? Do\nwe have such an interest in having every inmate do that\nfrom the day they enter prison? This is very different.\nQUESTION: I think you can make a better\nargument.\nMR. McALLISTER: We could make that argument.\nQUESTION: It's better for people to confront\nthe consequences of what they've done.\nMR. McALLISTER: We could make that argument,\nand in this case it's critical, actually --\nQUESTION: I'd be very troubled by that.\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, it's much more than that\nin this case, because here the therapists are clear that\ndenial is a big problem with sex offenders, and to\novercome that denial we need a meaningful acceptance of\nresponsibility, not an immunity that simply allows the\ninmate to talk with no consequence whatsoever,\npotentially. We need a meaningful acceptance, and that's\nwhat we're after here, and Mr. Lile has not questioned\nthat's a legitimate --\nQUESTION: Well, you think it can only be\nmeaningful if you compel them to admit to a new crime for\nwhich they could be prosecuted?\nMR. McALLISTER: Except with all due respect,\nJustice O'Connor, we would not say we're compelling them.\nWe're simply giving them a choice that has some real\nconsequences. We want people in this program who really\nwant to participate. We have a waiting list to get into\nthis program, so we don't need inmates in this program who\nare not serious about this. We have plenty who are\nwilling to take advantage of the program as it's done,\nright now, and it's full, and there's a waiting list.\nQUESTION: Then why isn't your penalogical\ninterest satisfied in confining the program to those who\nwant to be in it, who will not be subject to this\ncompulsion, if that's what it is?\nI mean, your argument is that we have a\npenalogical interest, in effect, that justifies these\nconsequences.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes, we do.\nQUESTION: But if you could fill your program\nwithout even having to raise the issue that involves these\nconsequences, why do you have a penalogical interest in\nthe insistence that gives rise to this case?\nMR. McALLISTER: Because these fellows have\nproven that most -- or, not most, but many of them will\nnot voluntarily engage in this program, even though they\nneed --\nQUESTION: I'm assuming that is so, but if you\ncan fill the program with people who will, why is there an\ninterest in effect in forcing the issue for those who do\nnot want to do it voluntarily?\nMR. McALLISTER: Because we still have an\ninterest in rehabilitating all of these sex offenders.\nJust because some of them are more willing to be\nrehabilitated doesn't mean the State does not have an\ninterest --\nQUESTION: Well, if the program is full, then is\nyour interest in simply getting statements of guilt or\nsomething from people who will never go into the program?\nMR. McALLISTER: No, and that's why he has the\nchoice. He can simply refuse. He could refuse, and\nthere's no incrimination if he refuses to participate, but\nwhat he's doing is taking up a bed in the medium part of\nthe facility, which is overcrowded at this point, in\nessence double-celled everyone, and the medium unit is a\nworking unit. The medium unit is for people who are\nactively involved in prison programs, and so we just don't\nhave the space. If you're not going to work at your\nprograms, we'll move you. That's what we're trying to do\nwith Mr. Lile.\nQUESTION: But it's not a voluntary program,\nit's a conscription system. What you -- first, I'd like\nyou to go back to the rehabilitation thing, because that\nis an aim, an aspiration for every prisoner, and you made\nvery strongly the point that the first step in\nrehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility. If that's\nso, I don't see why you -- this -- you could not do this\nwith every prisoner who enters.\nYou could say, take responsibility by confessing\nthat you did what you were accused of doing, no matter\nwhat your defense was. Two, tell us about all your other\nnefarious deeds. You apply this to sex offenders, but the\nreasons that you did seem to me to be across the board.\nIs there any distinction, any constitutional distinction\nthat you would make, or are you saying yes, we could do\nthis in the case of every prisoner?\nMR. McALLISTER: If there's -- as long as\nthere's a deter -- a legitimate penalogical interest, yes,\npotentially we could. We don't. We're only focused on\nthe sex offenders here, but if there's a legitimate reason\nto do it, potentially --\nQUESTION: Well, let's take out the if, because\nis there or isn't there? Is it -- in the case of everyone\nthat you incarcerate there is an interest in\nrehabilitating that person.\nMR. McALLISTER: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And you have said that the first step\nin rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility for the\nwrong that you've done.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: But you also rely, don't you, Mr.\nMcAllister, on the fact that the therapists for this\nparticular type of crime have come down very hard on the\nidea, and I take it perhaps there may not be the same body\nof support for that sort of treatment for other offenders.\nMR. McALLISTER: And there's certainly not, for\nexample, treatment programs necessarily for burglars or\nrobbers or other categories. The sex offender program is\nsomewhat special in that respect.\nQUESTION: But constitutionally, if suddenly\nsomebody got a good idea here and a psychiatrist came\nforward saying yes, you can reform property criminals too,\nwe'd be in exactly the same boat.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes, potentially, and that's\nnot, in our view, a constitutional problem, because this\nCourt has long said none of the things we're talking about\nhere are atypical in prison. The inmates have no\nparticular expectation of a particular set of living\nconditions within prison. Meachum v. Fano is very clear.\nThey could be transferred from one prison to another for\nwhatever reason or no reason at all, without violating the\nConstitution. This is a very mild incentive program to\ntry to get these fellows to meaningfully participate in\nthe program.\nQUESTION: The kind of conundrum that puzzles me\nthat I don't have an answer to is illustrated by the trial\nprocess itself. I suppose the Government couldn't\npossibly say, if you insist on your right to a jury trial,\nand insist on your right to remain silent, we're going to\nsentence you to 10 more years in jail. But the Government\ncan say, if you confess, and don't go to trial, and show\ntrue contrition, we'll give you 10 years less. That's\nwritten into the guidelines.\nBut they seem to come to the same thing. Well,\nthat seems to be true of this case, and if I could\nunderstand how to analyze the first, I might be able to\nunderstand how to analyze the second.\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, Justice Breyer, to say\nthe first is different, or in essence we're different,\nbecause all of our -- this takes place inside the prison.\nThe expectations are quite different. That's why we\ndiscuss Sandin in the briefs, not because it is\nnecessarily transportable to the Fifth Amendment, but what\nSandin recognizes is prisons are very different, and what\nthe expectations are, what the hardships are is just a\nvery different situation than free citizens, and what they\nmay be confronted within the way of choices.\nQUESTION: You are saying you can have two\nclasses of prisoners, those who have confessed to their\ncrimes and those who haven't, and you can treat them\ndifferently, no TV, no meat at lunch, no recreation, no\nsoftball, and it seems to me the necessary consequence of\nthat for a prisoner facing a long term is that it's going\nto induce confessions from innocent people.\nMR. McALLISTER: Except, Justice Kennedy -- it\nmay do that, but our program, just like the Federal\nprogram, has pretty strict confidentiality limits.\nBasically there's a patient-therapist privilege that\noperates here, and the only reason -- they're given a form\nright up front that says the only reasons the therapist\nwill disclose anything that's disclosed to the therapist,\nvery limited, things that deal with safety within the\nprison, threats to other inmates --\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: I thought you conceded -- you\nconceded that a prosecutor, say, in the sexual history --\nhe says, I committed X, Y, Z rapes -- that a prosecutor,\nas long as there's no statute of limitations problem, in\nKansas -- unlike, as I understand the Federal program is,\na prosecutor could say, okay, now we're going to indict\nyou for that.\nMR. McALLISTER: My understanding is they could\ndo that in the Federal program as well, because there's no\nimmunity granted under the Federal program either, so if\nthey actually made a statement, the Federal program could\nprosecute them just like we could. We have not, in 13\nyears of this program.\nQUESTION: Yes, but under the Federal program\nthey don't suffer any loss of anything if they don't make\nthe statement and under yours, they do.\nMR. McALLISTER: That's true, but --\nQUESTION: But under yours, in any case, whether\nthe Feds do it or not, under yours the prosecutor could\nuse that information, couldn't he?\nMR. McALLISTER: Could. We never have, but\ncould, yes, theoretically could.\nQUESTION: May I ask you, Mr. McAllister, do you\nknow -- there's similar programs in a lot of States, as I\nunderstand it. Do any of them give the inmate immunity if\nhe participates in the program?\nMR. McALLISTER: Justice Stevens, it's my\nunderstanding that some may, although I don't know the\nexact number, and I do know from the State amicus brief\nthe 18 States that signed onto that obviously think\nimmunity is a bad idea and, as I said, the Federal\nGovernment does not immunize the inmates who participate\nin the Federal program.\nQUESTION: I understand the Federal Government\ndoes not, yes.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Of those, how many are like Kansas?\nThat is, it isn't a voluntary thing?\nMR. McALLISTER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't know\nthe answer to that. I don't know exactly what their\nprograms are like.\nOurs was the first of its kind in some sense\nwhen we implemented this program, so some may have\nfollowed our model, but I don't know for sure.\nWith the Court's permission, I'd like to\nremain -- reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. McAllister.\nMr. Garre, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, why does the Federal\nGovernment not think it a good idea to grant immunity?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, the Federal\nGovernment has a very limited program that applies in only\none facility Nation-wide, and it has made a determination\nto allow for voluntary participation among convicted\nsexual offenders in that program.\nNow, in our view that is a judgment that this\nCourt's decisions clearly enable the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons to make, and we think that the Kansas prison\nofficials have acted within their judgment to adopt a\ndifferent kind of program. As the therapists all\nacknowledge, denial is one of the biggest obstacles to\nreceiving treatment in these kinds of programs, and I\nthink it's important for the Court to recognize --\nQUESTION: Are you going to get around the\nanswering my question? Why did the Federal Government\nthink it not a good idea to grant immunity in its program?\nMR. GARRE: Oh, the Federal Government reserves\nthe right of the same confidentiality limits that the\nState does, that is, to deal with offenses that threatens\ninstitutional security, to deal with suspected cases of\nchild abuse, to deal with suspected cases of harm to\nindividuals within the prison or outside of the prisons.\nThose confidentiality limits are clearly related to\nlegitimate penalogical interests, and we think that the\nFederal Government --\nQUESTION: Only those things can be prosecuted?\nI thought that it -- that prosecution was available for\nanything that was disclosed, although there was\nconfidentiality.\nMR. GARRE: That's right. The confidentiality\nlimits work in conjunction --\nQUESTION: Those are confidentiality limits, not\nimmunity limits, right?\nMR. GARRE: That's right.\nQUESTION: So the Federal Government has not\ngiven use immunity for anybody in the program.\nMR. GARRE: And that's absolutely clear from the\nwaiver of the confidentiality statement that inmates sign\nbefore they enrol in the program, and we think that\nparticularly where you're dealing with a program that does\nclearly promote legitimate penalogical interests in\nrehabilitating a class of offenders that poses a unique\nrisk of recidivism upon their release, that States, the\nmere fact that the State doesn't grant immunity to inmates\nwho participate does not provide an answer to the\nconstitutional problem.\nQUESTION: The Feds --\nQUESTION: Well, does the Federal Government\ndeprive the prisoner of any benefits or programs if he\nrefuses to engage in the program?\nMR. GARRE: The Federal Government doesn't apply\nthe same incentive schemes that the State of Kansas does\nfor participation.\nQUESTION: Are there any? What are the\nincentives in the Federal program?\nMR. GARRE: The incentives -- the overriding\nincentive is, of course, the value of the treatment that\nthe inmate receives. Now, once a --\nQUESTION: But not -- nothing is threatened or\ncarried out in the Federal program to deprive the\nnonconsenting prisoner of any privilege, is that right?\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true up front in terms\nof the incentive scheme. Now, once an inmate is in the\nprogram, and if he chooses not to comply with the\nacceptance of responsibility goals, the inmate can be\ntransferred back to his parent facility and that can be\nsomething on its record, but certainly up front --\nQUESTION: The choice to go into the program is\nstrictly the inmates. There's no coercion or inducement.\nHe loses nothing if he chooses not to go in, is that\ncorrect?\nMR. GARRE: That's the way the Federal Bureau of\nPrisons --\nQUESTION: Is it a more desirable facility?\nMR. GARRE: It is at a more desirable facility.\nQUESTION: So what he loses is, he doesn't -- he\nisn't -- he doesn't get out of the rotten place he's in to\na better facility, right?\nMR. GARRE: I think that's right, and I think\nit's important --\nQUESTION: But he doesn't lose a benefit that he\ncurrently has?\nMR. GARRE: Well, we don't -- we think that the\nprivileges that we're talking about in the case of Kansas,\nTV ownership, personal TV in the cell, visitation\nprivileges beyond immediate family, and lawyers, canteen\nexpenditures, these aren't the sorts of things --\nQUESTION: The right to work, the right to take\nother programs in the prison?\nMR. GARRE: The privileges are reduced. I think\nthat the chart that's on page 27 of the joint appendix\nexplains how they're reduced.\nQUESTION: Substantial reduction in how much you\ncan earn in prison, what jobs you can do in prison, isn't\nthat so?\nMR. GARRE: There is a definite reduction, and\nthe flip side of that is Kansas reserves the higher\nprivileges, the more modern facilities to those inmates\nwho choose to take the constructive steps towards\nreentering society.\nQUESTION: Okay, but there's no --\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre --\nQUESTION: There's no reduction in the Federal\nsystem, is that correct?\nMR. GARRE: There's no -- the Federal system\ncurrently doesn't employ the same earnable privilege\nscheme that the Kansas prison does.\nQUESTION: We're trying to be specific about it.\nAs I think we think we understand it, the inmate cannot\nlose privileges that the inmate currently enjoys simply by\nexercising the option not to enter the program. Are we\ncorrect?\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, except that the\ninmate can be sent back to his parent facility.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you have said -- you said in\nyour opening statement, and you seem to be backing away\nfrom it, you said the Federal program is a voluntary\nprogram.\nMR. GARRE: As is --\nQUESTION: It's not a voluntary program, at\nleast not for the people like --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: That's sort of the issue here, isn't\nit?\nMR. GARRE: With respect, we think that that is\nthe issue. I mean, we're not talking about losing\nsomeone's job, or means of livelihood, the consequence\nfaced by free individuals in the penalty cases that\nrespondents relied upon. We're talking about loss of\ninstitutional privileges that inmates have no expectation\nof enjoying once they enter the prison. We think that the\nprison context is key to evaluating the Fifth Amendment\nclaim in this case.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you this, Mr. Garre. Maybe\nyou can give me some help with the larger question that's\nbothering me and I think underlies Justice Ginsburg's\nfirst question. The rule of unconstitutional conditions\ndoesn't seem to apply in our cases, or hasn't been applied\nin the Fifth Amendment context. Why is that?\nMR. GARRE: Well, foremost because the Fifth\nAmendment says, compelled self-incrimination. The\namendment therefore recognizes that there are some sorts\nof pressures or conditions short of compulsion which would\nnot meet the Fifth Amendment standard, and this Court's\ncases --\nQUESTION: Anything short of compulsion does not\nmeet it? That is to say, you can have two classes of\ninmates, those who've confessed and those who haven't, for\nall of prison life?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: And isn't there a danger, then, of\ninducing innocent people to confess?\nMR. GARRE: I think that type of hypothetical is\nmuch different, much further afield than the program in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Well, the Fifth Amendment doesn't say\ninducing, does it, it says compelling.\nMR. GARRE: It says compelling, that's exactly\nright, and that's supported by the text and history and\npurpose of the amendment.\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, don't we in fact have two\nclasses in all prison systems, those who have pleaded\nguilty and have gotten a relatively short sentence by\nreason of their guilty plea for a particular crime, and\nthose who have refused to plead guilty and have gotten a\nlonger sentence because of their refusal to do so, for the\nsame crime?\nMR. GARRE: That's --\nQUESTION: You have two classes in prison.\nMR. GARRE: That's absolutely --\nQUESTION: I mean, not just not being able to\nspend as much at the PX, but they're there for another 15\nyears.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, and I think it's\nimportant for the Court to recognize that these sorts of\nearnable daily privileges like TV ownership, canteen\nexpenditures, and housing in preferred facilities are\namong the most common tools the prison administrators use\nto manage order in the prison environment and to encourage\ninmates to take socially constructive steps. This Court's\ncases like Sandin and Meachum and Bell v.Wolfish recognize\nthat once someone is lawfully incarcerated, that brings\nabout a necessary withdrawal of many rights and privileges\nconsistent with the needs of day-to-day management.\nQUESTION: So is compulsion anything other than\nphysical, or psychological?\nMR. GARRE: Oh, sure. Sure.\nQUESTION: So what would be -- I mean, in --\noutside prison we know, at least this Court's precedent\nhas said losing your membership in the bar, losing your\njob, that counts as compulsion, even though no one is\nputting you on the rack and screw.\nMR. GARRE: And we think -- we agree with Judge\nFriendly and others who have suggested that those cases\nlie at the outer reaches of this Court's Fifth Amendment\njurisprudence, and we think that the denial of the sorts\nof common, routine privileges at issue in this case, TV\nprivileges, canteen expenditures, don't even come close.\nQUESTION: How about loss of visiting\nprivileges? That could be crucial to a prisoner.\nMR. GARRE: Well, it's not a complete loss of\nthis case. Again, the chart on page 27 of the joint\nappendix in the case that --\nQUESTION: Suppose it were. I mean, there are\nsome of these things that must mean all the difference in\nthe world to someone who's incarcerated.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I mean, the further the Court\ngoes out in that direction, then obviously at some point\nthat program would be more difficult to defend under the\nTurner v. --\nQUESTION: That's the Kansas program. --\nMR. GARRE: -- analysis.\nQUESTION: They want to offer no limit on what\nthey can do here. They can prosecute for a new crime that\nmight be disclosed, and they can deprive the prisoner of\nall visiting privileges and all kinds of things.\nMR. GARRE: Well, with respect, we don't think\nthat that's the Kansas program. The Kansas program offers\nincentives by withholding privileges from those inmates\nwho choose not to take socially constructive steps. It's\nimportant to recognize that no one disputes that the\nrehabilitation program in this case is designed to serve\nlegitimate penalogical interests. There's widespread\nagreement the sexual offender treatment programs benefits\ninmates and society alike by enabling convicted\noffenders --\nQUESTION: But it just sounds like a basic\ndifference. As I understand your description in the one\nFederal program, it sounds like if the prisoner says no, I\nwon't participate, the prisoner goes back to the facility\nof origin and can still, over time, earn various\nprivileges, and Kansas is telling us in their scheme no,\nthey reserve the right to deprive the prisoner of any\nprivilege thereafter during his term in prison, and to put\nhim in a more severe condition of incarceration.\nMR. GARRE: Well, again, I would disagree with\nthe characterization of the Kansas program, but more\nimportantly we think that the judgment made by the Federal\nBureau of Prison and the judgment made by the Kansas\nprison officials are well within the range of decisions\nthat this Court's prison decision --\nQUESTION: Even if I'm correct in my\ndescription?\nMR. GARRE: Your description presents a\ndifferent situation.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMr. Wiltanger, we'll hear from -- is it\nWiltanger, or Wiltanger.\nQUESTION: It's Wiltanger, Your Honor\nQUESTION: Wiltanger. Mr. Wiltanger, we'll hear\nfrom you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. WILTANGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WILTANGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf you're a prisoner in Kansas and you commit a\nrape while in prison, you get the same penalties that Mr.\nLile gets. If you're a prisoner in Kansas and you commit\narson in your cell or somewhere in the prison, you get the\nsame penalties that Mr. Lile gets. If you commit a theft,\nyou get the same penalties.\nQUESTION: You mean, someone who commits arson\nin prison gets only those penalties? He isn't prosecuted\nfor committing arson?\nMR. WILTANGER: There could be a potential\nprosection if they turn him over --\nQUESTION: That might --\nQUESTION: Like a number more years in jail.\nMR. WILTANGER: That could be, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's quite different.\nMR. WILTANGER: But under the State system they\nget moved down to the same level that Mr. Lile is, and in\nfact their punishment could be worse, because --\nQUESTION: And I expect the arsonist considers\nthat he least of his worries.\nQUESTION: When you say punishment, you assume\nyour answer in your favor. What I'd like to know is, the\nway they characterize it, basically, is that you come in\nwithout anything. Indeed, your client went -- he started\noff in a maximum security part of the prison with a medium\nsecurity bed, or at least he could have done, and then\nwhat happens is, people who participate in treatment\nprograms get bonuses, privileges, and if you don't\nparticipate in the treatment program, well, obviously you\ndon't get the privilege. Now, that's their\ncharacterization of it, basically.\nYours is, well, if you start treatment and you\nstop, you get punished.\nNow, you're both describing the same thing, but\nit sounds as if it has very different consequences, and\nhow are we supposed to say which is the correct\ndescription, the appropriate characterization?\nMR. WILTANGER: I think the difference, Your\nHonor, is somewhat illustrated by the Government's\nattorney in that this is not voluntary, and that once you\nachieve a level -- the State has set up a structure, Your\nHonor, under which if you're good, you do your job, you\nget to a certain level, and that's for everybody. They\nhave rules on this, and Mr. Lile did that. He got to that\nlevel. He had achieved something.\nAnd what the State does is, it comes along and\nsays, well, if you don't give up your Fifth Amendment\nrights, and if you don't tell us about all these other\nuncharged crimes, we're taking that away from you. You'll\nno longer have it. You'll lose your job.\nQUESTION: Is that true, or is it true that\ntheir system is, you will be awarded privileges as long as\nyou participate in treatment, but our privileges are open\nonly to people who participate in treatment?\nMR. WILTANGER: I would disagree with that, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: All right, because?\nMR. WILTANGER: Because people in the prison\nsystem who do not participate in treatment get the same\nprivileges. They get to get to that level, not just --\nQUESTION: Why did he lose his?\nMR. WILTANGER: Why did he lose his privileges?\nWell, he hasn't, technically, Your Honor, lost his\nprivileges --\nQUESTION: No, no --\nQUESTION: What about non sex offenders --\nMR. WILTANGER: Non sex offenders --\nQUESTION: -- who have no ability to go into the\nprogram?\nMR. WILTANGER: Have no ability, but other --\nQUESTION: That's a different category of\nprisoner.\nMR. WILTANGER: But there could be other sex\noffenders in the prison who are not required to take SATP,\nfor example, if there was a -- if for some reason there\nwas a statutory rape penalty they may not be required to\ntake SATP, but yes, all prisoners in the system, sex\noffenders, murderers, arsonists, get a chance to get --\nQUESTION: What case from our Court, or what\ncases do you think most strongly support your position?\nMR. WILTANGER: Your Honor, I think the cases of\nGarrity, Gardner, Cunningham support --\nQUESTION: We're talking about loss of job in a\ncivilian society. Do you think the denials here are of\nthat consequence?\nMR. WILTANGER: I do, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. WILTANGER: Specifically as to the job, Mr.\nLile, if -- any inmate in the prison system in Kansas, if\nthey were, for example, in minimum security can work an\noutside job. They obviously can't leave, but they could\ngo pick up trash along the road and they could make\nwhatever the employer is going to pay them. Say -- assume\nit's $7 an hour. Maybe it's not that much. They can keep\nthat money. If they don't keep all of it, they pay some\nto the prison, they pay some to victims' restitution, but\nif they lose their job, under the Kansas structure they\nwill never get to work a job that is even equivalent to\nthat.\nQUESTION: You're talking about a situation\nwhere in civilian life the person who loses his job loses\nhis livelihood, basically. Certainly that's not true in a\nprison. This man is going to eat whether he does it or\nnot.\nMR. WILTANGER: He will eat, Your Honor, but at\nthe same time a policeman on guard or a policeman on duty\ncould go out and get another job and earn something, an\nequivalent wage, or possibly even a better wage. Mr. Lile\ncan't.\nQUESTION: Mr. McAllister, I am very, very --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wiltanger.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Wiltanger -- I am\nvery reluctant to extend our expansive notion of what\nconstitutes compulsion to the area of criminal law and\npenology for this simple reason. Why does the situation\nof your client differ from the situation of the person\nwho's been arrested for first degree order, and the case\nis put to him by the prosecutor, you know, I'll go ahead\nwith this prosecution for first degree murder. You will\nbe in prison for life. On the other hand, if you confess\nthat you are guilty of voluntary manslaughter, you'll get\na 15-year term. Now, has that person been compelled to\nplead guilty to voluntary manslaughter?\nMR. WILTANGER: No, they haven't, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But that's -- you know, either you do\nit, or you're going to get life.\nMR. WILTANGER: I don't -- Your Honor, our view\nis not -- is that that is not compulsion, because what is\nbeing extended to the murder suspect is a benefit, some\nway to improve your lot.\nIn this situation, for example, if the State\nwanted to -- what they're doing -- it's not Mr. Lile's\ncase, because he was convicted before 1995, but if you're\nconvicted after 1995 you can be stripped of your good-\ntime credit. They take it away from you. If, on the\nother hand, the State decided that what we're going to do\nfor those inmates who are participating in the program is\nextend their good-time credit or make their situation\nbetter, or give them a benefit, I don't think that's -- I\ndon't think that would be --\nQUESTION: It's almost a play on words, then.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, just start them off in the\nworst situation and just say, you know --\nQUESTION: That certainly doesn't benefit\nprisoners as a class.\nQUESTION: The Constitution surely can't turn on\nthat, whether you characterize it as giving them a benefit\nor depriving them of a benefit they --\nMR. WILTANGER: Well, the Constitution obviously\nprohibits any kind of sanction for the invocation of your\nFifth Amendment rights.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wiltanger, you said it in your\nbrief, and I wanted to make sure that it really is your\nposition. You said, here is a man with a certain set of\nprivileges. They take that away, and that's compulsion,\nbut if you started everyone -- you didn't say everyone,\nyou said every sex offender goes in at level 1, the lowest\nlevel, and never gets out of that unless he signs up for\nthis program with all its terms and conditions. That\nperson you say is not being compelled because for him it's\nnot achieving privileges rather than having privileges\ntaken away.\nIs that -- do you adhere to that distinction,\nthat the State of Kansas could do exactly what it's doing\nnow if it said, Mr. Wiltanger and all sexual offenders,\nyou go in at level 1 and you never get out of it unless\nyou take this program?\nMR. WILTANGER: Your Honor, I do think that's\ncertainly closer to the -- that would be closer to a\nconstitutional law. That wouldn't be unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Would be, or wouldn't?\nMR. WILTANGER: It would not be, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It would not be.\nMR. WILTANGER: It would not be\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: That's what you said in your brief.\nMR. WILTANGER: It would not be\nunconstitutional. That is our position.\nQUESTION: So the whole thing, then, it comes\ndown to, subtraction is no good. That doesn't work, but\naddition is okay. I mean, you could give the person\nnothing in the beginning, and then the carrot is okay. But\nyou can t once -- so this really says to Kansas, what\nyou re doing, the whole program is fine. The only thing\nis, you take this category of offender and you don t give\nthem anything until they take this program.\nMR. WILTANGER: If they could set up a system or\na structure or fashion some rules -- obviously, they don't\nhave that now -- I don't think that would be\nunconstitutional.\nAgain, I do think there is -- if the Court\ndoesn't want to draw a hypertechnical distinction, that's\nfine, but the Court -- the Fifth Amendment doesn't\nprohibit benefiting somebody or making their life better.\nQUESTION: So you think the Sentencing\nGuidelines would be invalid if, instead of the current\nprovision, which gives you good points for acceptance of\nresponsibility, it rather gave you bad points for refusing\nto accept responsibility.\nMR. WILTANGER: I do, Your Honor. I do.\nQUESTION: If that's so --\nQUESTION: It's a constitutional distinction.\nMR. WILTANGER: I do believe so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If that's so, does this case -- my\nunderstanding of it is that the prison created a new\npolicy, and that policy was that everybody was at level 1\nunless you participate in a recommended program, that that\nwas their new policy, but that your client was\ngrandfathered in at level 3 because he was in prison at\nthe time, and so this case in your opinion turns on the\nfact that we're dealing with one of the few prisoners who\nwas grandfathered in, and therefore it's a taking away\nrather than being a new prisoner who would have started at\nlevel 1, in which case it would have been added on.\nMR. WILTANGER: Not exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. WILTANGER: Because all inmates -- there\nwere not just inmates at level 3 who were grandfathered\nin. Every single inmate who enters the prison system can\nget to level 3, and as opposing counsel --\nQUESTION: Even without participating in a\nrecommended program?\nMR. WILTANGER: Absolutely. Absolutely.\nQUESTION: But then they changed the rule and\nsaid, if you don't participate in the recommended program,\nyou can't get to level 3. Is that right?\nMR. WILTANGER: If -- they have not changed the\nrule. That is not the current rule. The current rule\nis -- and the way that SATP, or the sex offender treatment\nis structured is, you don't really become eligible to take\nit or forced to take it until about 2 years before your\nfirst parole date, so by that time -- especially in Mr.\nLile's case. He's been in prison for 15 years -- most\ninmates are going to be at that level 3, so while he was\ngrandfathered in, most inmates, when they get eligible or\nare forced to take it are going to be at level 3.\nThere has been no change in policy. The State\nis now not saying that you don't get from level 1 to level\n2 unless you participate in SATP. The law still is, if\nyou're at level 3, you're going to level 1, and you're\ngoing to go to maximum security, and you're going to stay\nthere forever.\nAgain, the reference I was making at the first\nis, the arsonist --\nQUESTION: That's -- this is a product of the --\nthey don't have the facility to give this course to\neveryone, so they say, when you're getting closer to\nrelease time, you get it, so most people who were in as\nsexual offenders don't have the opportunity.\nMR. WILTANGER: Well, the State wants all --\nwants their sex offenders to take it. There is a little\nbit of a concern response, but what they do is, they move\npeople around to make sure that those people who are\ncoming out --\nQUESTION: But not their first year, from what I\nunderstand.\nMR. WILTANGER: No, Your Honor. I apologize if\nI misspoke. You would not be entering into sex offender\ntreatment your first year, typically.\nQUESTION: But your brief described a system\nwhere, suppose we had all sex offenders, they go in at\nlevel 1 unless they take the program. That's something\nthat doesn't exist in the current world only because of a\nlack of resources, that Kansas can't give this program to\nall the people who would qualify, so it concentrates on\nthe people who have served a substantial part of their\nsentence already.\nMR. WILTANGER: That is correct, and please\nunderstand, Your Honor, that that is only one possible\nsolution that would allow the State to continue to run its\nSATP. Obviously, another solution, as set forth by the\nTenth Circuit, would be immunity.\nAnother thing, to follow the program that the\nFederal Government runs, make it voluntary. Extract no\npenalties, and punish no one if they don't want to\nparticipate in the program, or take away the admission of\nresponsibility, or take away the need --\nQUESTION: The second one is no solution. The\nState wants people to take it. They think it's important\nfor the rehabilitation of the people and for the safety of\nsociety. They do want to exert some pressure for people\nto go into it. The question is whether this pressure is\nsomehow unconstitutional when you deprive the person of\nnothing to which he's entitled, nothing to which he had\nany expectation of receiving when he goes into prison. He\ncould have been kept at level 1 for his whole period\nthere.\nMR. WILTANGER: Your Honor, I agree with that.\nThe one distinction I would make is, the State has set up\na system by which prisoners understand that if they do\ncertain things they get to levels. While there may not be\na constitutional liberty interest in it, they do know that\nif they follow the rules they're going to get to this\nlevel.\nBut as far as addressing your first point,\nimmunity would be the result then. If you had to have\neverybody in the program, if there was no other option,\nthen you would extend them immunity, or the other solution\ncould be, if you wanted everyone in the program, don't\nmake them admit guilt to their crime. Don't make them\ncatalogue every offense that they've never been charged\nwith. Don't then use a polygraph test to sit down and\nferret out and make sure that you've got every single past\ncrime. That would be one solution beyond simple immunity.\nQUESTION: But that's a solution that isn't\nconsistent with the therapist's idea that this is how it\nshould be done.\nMR. WILTANGER: Potentially, Your Honor. I\nmean, the State has not always required a written\nadmission of responsibility. It's only been within the\npast 10 years that they've required that. But you're\ncorrect, the therapists apparently believe that you have\nto have an admission of responsibility. I'm not sure why\nit has to be a written statement where you fess everything\nup.\nQUESTION: But certainly the Constitution can't\nturn on whether or not a written statement is required.\nMR. WILTANGER: I -- Your Honor, I agree, that\nis correct.\nQUESTION: Do you know -- I asked your opponent\nthis question -- the extent to which other States have\ngranted immunity to solve this problem?\nMR. WILTANGER: There are a couple of States\nthat I know off-hand, Your Honor. California and Kentucky\nhave confidentiality provisions, privileges that keep all\nof this stuff kept within. I don't believe it's a\nmajority of the States that do that. I wish I had a\nbetter answer. I do believe Kansas is the only State that\nrequires all this additional ferreting out of additional\ninformation.\nQUESTION: Well, if the -- the programs are\nimportant, I take it, really important, and they're\nthinking that this is a very important way to run them, I\ngive them that, all right. Now, if I take your\napproach -- and I find this very difficult. I take your\napproach, and I try to distinguish between what's the add-\non as a privilege and the subtraction as a penalty, now my\nconcern would be, I'm now facing a nightmare of varying\nsituations in prisons across the country, and varying\nefforts to say what's the status quo in respect to a\nparticular prisoner, what is an add-on as opposed to a\nsubtraction, and the arguments are infinite. Now, what\ncould you say that would relieve me of that concern?\nMR. WILTANGER: Well, first, Your Honor, if this\nCourt doesn't want to get drawn into a benefit versus a\npunishment distinction, you don't have to follow that for\nthis rule. That is the position that we mentioned in the\nbrief, that there is -- that we feel there is a difference\nbetween a benefit and a punishment.\nBut I also don't think that there will be a rash\nof litigation. The Supreme Court law, obviously, as you\nknow, speaks to sanctions, speak to penalty, anything that\nmakes your indication of your Fifth Amendment rights\ncostly, and we've have that rule for quite sometime, and\ncertainly there have been cases that have come down since\nthen where you look at it and decide, well, is he being\npenalized, so again I'm -- I apologize if I'm sticking to\na hypertechnical distinction, but I do believe that the\nlaw would not really complicate matters, and that there is\nnot going to be a rash of litigation where --\nQUESTION: Well, you didn't answer the question,\nthough, and I have the same problem Justice Breyer does.\nI don't know that we can distinguish between a benefit and\na sanction. I don't know that that's a line that at the\nend of the day is going to be a good line, so what other\nline do you offer?\nMR. WILTANGER: Well, I do believe that\nsanction -- or what you can look at is, you could look at\nthis Court's ruling as to what is a voluntary statement in\nthe Colman case, whether or not he's being able to make an\nunconstrained choice. Now --\nQUESTION: Why not look to what Sandin looked to\nin -- true, not in the context of the Fifth Amendment, but\nin another context, and that is whether you have been\ndeprived of in prison is beyond what is the normal\nexpectation of prison life.\nMR. WILTANGER: Your Honor, I think that does a\ncouple of things, and why we disagree with Sandin. One\nis, I think you're creating a new rule, whereas I think we\nalready have a fine rule that works in the Fifth Amendment\narena, and if we're concerned about applying a Fifth\nAmendment rule in the prison system --\nQUESTION: No, no, we don't have a rule that\napplies in the Fifth Amendment arena with regard to\ndepriving people of things to which they are not entitled\nas free citizens. When you deprive someone of a job, he\nisn't entitled to that job. You are depriving him of some\nliberty that he, in fact, possessed.\nYour client has been deprived of no liberty to\nwhich he was entitled, not a single liberty to which he\nwas entitled. He could have been kept in level 1 for his\nentire period in prison. He would have had no complaint\nat all, so I don't think it's parallel to the out-of-\nprison cases, so it seems to me we need a new rule for in-\nprison cases.\nWe could have a rule that so long as you haven't\nbeen deprived of a liberty to which you're entitled, there\nhas been no compulsion. That goes pretty far. We don't\nhave to go that far. We could use a line that Sandin\nuses, so long as what's been done to you doesn't go below\nthe normal expectation of prison life. I mean, if they\nsaid, you either enter this program or you're going to be\nin solitary for the rest of your 15 years, you know,\nthat's beyond the normal expectation of prison life. But\nwhat your client has suffered is not that, it seems to me.\nMR. WILTANGER: Your Honor, I would agree with\nyou that Mr. Lile has no liberty interest at play here,\nbut I would also suggest that there is no liberty interest\nin an at-will employment. This Court has previously found\nthat if you're an at-will employee, you have no protected\nproperty or liberty interest, and yet in those cases like\nthe Gardner case and the Garrity case there has been found\na Fifth Amendment violation.\nThere certainly is no liberty interest in being\na political party officer in the Cunningham case, and yet\nwe still have a Fifth Amendment violation.\nQUESTION: Don't call it liberty, call it a\nright. Call it a right.\nMR. WILTANGER: That's --\nQUESTION: He's entitled as a free citizen to\nhave that. Your client is not entitled to be in level 3.\nMR. WILTANGER: But the way that the State has\nset up its structure, they have made rules that they want\neverybody working. He's entitled to have a job. They\nwant him to have a job.\nThe other reason I think Sandin doesn't work,\nYour Honor, is I do share some of the concern that was\npreviously expressed by some of the other justices, is\nthat there would seem to be no reason why the State\ncouldn't walk up and down the hall, or up and down the\ncells with a note pad and suggest, well, what's your\ncrime, did you do it? I'm not really concerned at whether\nyou have an appeal ongoing or not, I just want to know\nwhether you did it, and oh, by the way, please let me know\neverything else you've done.\nQUESTION: Okay, so we'll add to it, there has\nto be -- and the State of Kansas is perfectly willing to\nadd to it, it has to be for a legitimate penalogical\npurpose.\nMR. WILTANGER: And certainly I would agree with\nwhat's previously said, that there could be a legitimate\npenalogical purpose in confessing, in coming clean, and\nthat you will not be a model prisoner unless you take\nresponsibility for your crime, whether it be a sex offense\nor whether it be a murder.\nThe other reason I think Sandin is not\napplicable to this case, and should not be extended to\nthis case, is that this Court actually said in Sandin,\nwhile you don't have a due process right in a particular\nlevel of confinement, you do retain other protections such\nas the First and the Eighth Amendment, that if we move\nyou, you get moved from one place to another, you still\nmay be able to bring a constitutional claim, and that's\nwhat Mr. Lile's done. He's been moved in response to a\nproper indication of his Fifth Amendment rights, and he\nhas brought a lawsuit against the State. He his actually\nfollowing some of the dicta in Sandin.\nI don't think Sandin should be extended. I do\nthink there is a potential for abuse. Why would Sandin,\nif you extend it, why would it necessarily be limited to\nthe Fifth Amendment? Is it possible that a State, if it\nwanted, to go around and abridge First Amendment rights\nand suggest that that's --\nQUESTION: That's -- you see, I was thinking\nabout that, and the trouble with analogies, if you get one\nthat's very close, you become uncertain again. I mean,\nsuppose that the actual analogy was, there is a treatment\nprogram, and the treatment program requires the prisoner\nto be isolated and not get any mail and not write any\nletters to the newspapers for a couple of months, and they\nsay as part of this -- and it's totally legitimate, and\nthey say as part of this legitimate treatment program that\nyou can't write your letter to the newspaper, that's part\nof the treatment, and moreover, we'll give you a privilege\nif you do it.\nAnd now what happens is, they grandfather one\nperson in. Now I'm back in the same -- you see, I'm back\nin the same dilemma. Maybe it's not quite as bad, because\nyou don't have the word compelled there, but --\nMR. WILTANGER: Your Honor, I agree with the\nconcern over the technical distinction between benefit and\npenalty, but I would say in that instance, again, keep in\nmind that Mr. Lile's not just the sole person who's been\ngrandfathered in. He's one of many who were grandfathered\nin, but --\nQUESTION: It's not the grandfather -- I mean,\nit is the grandfather, isn't it, in this case that makes\nhim -- you said there were some other things, and I'd like\nto be sure to have them in mind, that make it a penalty\nand not just the withholding of a privilege.\nMR. WILTANGER: Assume for the moment Mr. Lile\nwere not grandfathered in.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WILTANGER: Assume for the moment he\narrives -- assume he committed his crime last year, and he\ngets sentenced to 20 years to life tomorrow. If he were\nto enter the prison system at intake level 1, in about 18\nyears from now the State will ask him to take the sex\noffender treatment. That's how it's typically planned.\nMr. Lile will follow the rules that the State has set out,\nwill follow the regulations, will be a model prisoner, as\nMr. Lile actually has been, and he will get all the way to\nlevel 3.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. WILTANGER: He will get all the way. He\nwill be there, and then --\nQUESTION: And crash --\nMR. WILTANGER: -- in 2019 they say to him,\nplease take SATP.\nQUESTION: Well, one difference, certainly\nbetween the First Amendment and its cases and the Fifth\nAmendment is that there is a compulsion requirement in\norder to invoke the Fifth Amendment, where the First\nAmendment doesn't have anything like that.\nMR. WILTANGER: I agree. They are different.\nThey are different standards. The only point that I was\ntrying to raise, Your Honor, is that I think Sandin is a\nlittle bit of a dangerous --\nQUESTION: I suppose --\nQUESTION: That's what distinguishes the\ndetriment and the benefit. There's a compulsion, but then\nit's a detriment. The First -- Fifth Amendment doesn't\nsay it shall be unlawful to bribe a witness to get him to\ntestify. The Fifth Amendment draws the line between\nbenefits and detriments, doesn't it?\nMR. WILTANGER: It does, and that's again -- I'm\nsorry.\nQUESTION: So the Kansas program would be\nperfectly okay, in your estimation, if it provided that at\nthe end of 18 years of 20-year sentences, or 2 years\nbefore the end of their sentence, all sex offenders shall\nbe reduced, all sex offenders shall be reduced to prison\nlevel 1.\nMR. WILTANGER: No, Your Honor, I -- I'm --\nQUESTION: Why not, because then -- then if they\nchoose to come in this program they will be getting the\nbenefit of going back up to 3, but all of them go down to\n1.\nMR. WILTANGER: I don't think that would be\nconstitutional, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. WILTANGER: I think it would be set up as a\nway to get around SATP and a way to get around the\ninvocation of your Fifth Amendment rights.\nQUESTION: Well, any --\nMR. WILTANGER: It would be an artifice.\nQUESTION: Well, of course it's an artifice, but\nso is the whole thing, benefit versus punishment. I\nmean --\nMR. WILTANGER: The one thing I would encourage\nthis Court to look at is, look at how it affects itself on\nthe prisoner, and again, if you're going to look at the\nColman case, which is -- again, is his choice an\nunconstrained one? Look at what is done to the inmate\nhere. He's never going to get back to level 3. The\narsonist will get back to level 3. The arsonist will not\nbe moved to maximum security. Mr. Lile is there forever.\nQUESTION: It's the same in my hypothetical,\nthough. There's no compulsion on him. After his 18\nyears in prison he's been knocked back down to 1. There's\nno compulsion on him. He gets a benefit if he joins this\nprogram.\nMR. WILTANGER: If it's entirely divorced from\nthe program or the Fifth Amendment, Your Honor, then that\npotentially would be constitutional. I would agree with\nthat. But unfortunately for Mr. Lile's case, it's not how\nthe State has set up the structure if you get to a point,\nyou follow the rules, you become a model prisoner, and\nthen you get broken down. That's what they're doing here.\nAnd again the point I was trying to make earlier\nis, the punishment's more severe. The Court calls -- or,\nexcuse me, the State calls this punishment. They call it\npunishment. When we're dealing with arsonists, when we're\ndealing with rapists, when we're dealing with somebody who\nsteals something, they call that punishment, but they're\nunwilling to call that punishment here. It's an\nincentive. It's a benefit, or an extension of a\nprivilege, but it's not.\nQUESTION: You're saying to decide what is\ncompulsion you've got to look at how other people are\ntreated, in effect.\nThe -- in your answer to Justice Scalia you\nsaid, you know, if everybody got knocked down within 2\nyears, no matter what the crime, there wouldn't be the\nconstitutional problem, but if only these people are, even\nthough it's written into the scheme the moment they go in,\nthere still would be a constitutional problem, and it's a\ncomparative treatment criterion among prisoners in\ndifferent classes of offenses that you're relying on,\nisn't it?\nMR. WILTANGER: Somewhat, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WILTANGER: Somewhat, and I agree, if the\nState had set up a strict --\nQUESTION: Then let me ask you to concentrate on\nthat question a little harder, because you did say in your\nbrief that if all sex offenders -- not all prisoners, all\nsex offenders on day 1 were put in class 1, they could\nstay there, and never get out unless the carrot that was\ndangled was taken. You did say sex offenders. You didn't\nsay all prisoners.\nMR. WILTANGER: That is correct.\nQUESTION: So apparently you are not objecting\nto a distinction between classes of prisoners.\nMR. WILTANGER: No, Your Honor, you're correct,\nand again that's consistent with the view that we took\nbetween the benefit and the sanction.\nQUESTION: So there isn't a comparative analysis\nas between classes of prisoners depending on their\noffense.\nMR. WILTANGER: No, Your Honor, there isn't.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WILTANGER: I apologize if I misspoke.\nQUESTION: Now, I understood you the other way.\nThat is, that you agree it would be an artifice, but if\nthe State did not knock down all sex offenders to level 1\n2 years before they get out, then you acknowledge your\nclient wouldn't have a case.\nMR. WILTANGER: Essentially, yes, that is\ncorrect. Again, that is not what we have in place here,\nbut that is correct. That is correct. The Fifth\nAmendment's a bedrock principle. This Court says it's the\nmainstay of the criminal justice system, and there's no\nmore powerful piece of evidence than someone's confession.\nThey ask a lot of Mr. Lile and other sex\noffenders. They not only ask for the admission of guilt,\nthey ask for everything, catalogue and give me everything\nyou want, and despite what the State says, there really\nisn't a great deal of confidentiality. These records can\nbe subpoenaed. They have to turn these records over if\nsomeone were to make an admission about a child sexual\noffense. Further, these inmates are forced to discuss\nthis stuff in group therapy session. There's no\nconfidentiality, and also to point out, the State has not\nappealed or contested that what it seeks is incriminating\ninformation.\nThis information, the Fifth Amendment itself, is\nfar too valuable that the State can go around and force\npeople to give it up and to extract penalties and\npunishment for that.\nThank you for your time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wiltanger.\nMr. McAllister, you have 3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McALLISTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to start, Justice O'Connor, by\nanswering a question you raised. Can the State simply\ntake away all the privileges? Absolutely not. We\nrecognize at some point it becomes compulsive, that this\nCourt has always treated the Fifth Amendment compulsion\ninquiry as contextual. We're simply arguing that in\nprison that's a very different context from being on the\noutside and losing a job or losing your law license.\nAt some point a court could decide, if we took\naway everything from Mr. Lile, that maybe that would be\ncompulsive, so we're not saying we can take away\neverything, but what we're saying is, what we're using\nhere is mild in the way of incentives in a prison. We\nhaven't taken away his right to spend money at the\ncanteen, his right to have visitors, his right to earn\nmoney. We've limited them, but none of that has been\ntaken away from him completely. That --\nQUESTION: They're saying with the cohort of\nprisoners you'll go along for 10 years, all of them\nearning points and credits, and then after 10 years,\nthey're all up to level 3, and then because he won't go in\nthe program, he alone is pushed back to level 1, and\nthat's a big change, and he says that's taking away --\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- something.\nMR. McALLISTER: Yes, but I mean, in our view\nthere's an important penalogical reason for doing that,\nand it doesn't rise to the level of compulsion because\nwe're in the prison setting. That's why we think Sandin\nis helpful here.\nQUESTION: But why wouldn't the same penalogical\nreason justify taking away all privileges? In other\nwords, why did you make the concession you made at the\nbeginning of your rebuttal?\nMR. McALLISTER: Because, all I'm saying is at\nsome point even Sandin recognizes at some point things are\natypical and they exceed the line, so although he could be\nmoved to disciplinary segregation without a due process\nhearing, if he was put in solitary confinement, that might\nhave been different. There is a line at which it becomes\ntoo much.\nQUESTION: No, but if he were put in solitary\nconfinement it would be justifiable, if at all, because of\na penalogical reason for the way he had behaved in prison,\ncreating dangerous conditions, et cetera. Why isn't the\nrehabilitation of sex offenders who, if unrehabilitated\nwill go out in the community and repeat their crimes, just\nas important a penalogical reason, and why wouldn't it\njustify taking away all privileges?\nMR. McALLISTER: Because the text of the Fifth\nAmendment says no person shall be compelled, and the\nquestion is compulsion, and at some point, if we took away\neverything, or we make him work 20 hours a day or -- we\ncould do things to him that I think the Court would have\nto say --\nQUESTION: No, but you're saying -- if I\nunderstand your argument, you're saying, one reason why\nyou should not characterize this as compulsion is the\nvalid penalogical reason for doing it.\nMR. McALLISTER: That's part of it.\nQUESTION: And my suggestion is, if there -- if\nthe State should say, look, the protection of these\nvictims on the outside, who are going to be preyed upon by\nthis person if not rehabilitated, is just as important as\npreventing people from setting fires in their cells, and\ntherefore, if we take all privileges to the fire-setters,\nwe've got an equally good penalogical reason to take away\nall privileges from the person who won't go into the\nprogram.\nMR. McALLISTER: And that I agree with. We do\nhave potentially --\nQUESTION: Then you could take away all the\nprivileges.\nMR. McALLISTER: Not all the privileges, because\nit has to rise to the level of compulsion, and if they are\nentitled to nothing in prison --\nQUESTION: That's the question.\nMR. McALLISTER: That's the question, and --\nQUESTION: Give him some rebuttal time.\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. McALLISTER: That's all right. I mean, that\nis the question, and again, the point that was drawn out\nhere on the distinction between --\nQUESTION: -- extended your time for 2 minutes,\nMr. McAllister, because you really didn't have a chance to\nsay much of anything, I'm afraid.\nMR. McALLISTER: All right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe distinction here between a loss of privilege\nand the granting of a benefit in the State's view is\nsimply a semantic game. There really -- I mean, from the\ninmate's perspective it just can't be any different, and\nif the notion is what we should have done is, we should\nall treat them as -- we should treat them all when they\ncome in as poorly as we can as long as we satisfy\nconstitutional minimum, treat them as poorly as we can,\nand then make them earn everything, if that's all it\ntakes, we can go back and do that, but that certainly\ndoesn't benefit inmates as a class, and it's certainly not\nhow prisons are run at this time in this country. It\nwould be a vast shift in the way prisons are administered.\nSo that's really a semantic game, and the key\ninquiry here is, are we compelling them, are we doing\nsomething sufficiently substantial to these inmates to\noverride their will and really force them to make these\nadmissions, again which are in a treatment context, not to\nlaw enforcement officials, confidentiality guidelines,\nwe've never prosecuted someone for anything they've said\nin this program --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nMcAllister.\nMR.
