McALLISTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Court has always held that the\ndefendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation\nof constitutional standards may be used for impeachment\npurposes when the defendant testifies at trial.\nThe Court has excluded statements for all\npurposes only when they are involuntary or have been\ncompelled. The question in this case is whether\nvoluntary statements obtained in violation of the rule\nof Massiah v. United States should be treated\ndifferently than all other voluntary statements.\nThe answer is \"no\" for at least three\nreasons. First, permitting the impeachment use of\nvoluntary statements obtained in violation of\nconstitutional standards is necessary to prevent perjury\nby criminal defendants.\nSecond, in terms of the effect at trial,\nthere is no basis for distinguishing a voluntary\nstatement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from\nFourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or\nviolations of the rule of Michigan v. Jackson.\nIn all of those situations the resulting\nevidence may limit defense counsel's options at trial,\nbut there is no basis in that respect for distinguishing\na Massiah violation. It has no different effect than\nthose others. Also, the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel does not include a right to commit perjury or to\nhave the assistance of counsel in presenting false\ntestimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When does -- when does the\nSixth Amendment violation occur?\nMR. McALLISTER: That question, Your Honor,\nas you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs, it's --\nKansas for purposes of deciding this case, is willing to\naccept the position of the United States and the\nRespondent that it occurs when the statement is admitted\nat trial, although the cases have not necessarily\ndefinitively resolved that question. We, frankly, think\nit is unnecessary to answer the question, because it's a\nminimal point in terms of potential deterrence --\ndeterrence that operate in this segment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do we have any\nother situation in which, for purposes of impeaching\ntestimony, a constitutional violation results?\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, that's the -- that is\none of the intricacies of this particular question,\nalthough arguably in the Fifth Amendment context\ncertainly the Miranda warnings are given. The police\ndon't do that. And if that is the completion of the\nviolation, it's analogous in many ways, if one looks\nback at the cases.\nThe Court has suggested that the actual\nviolation is the use of the statement at trial against\nthe defendant, not simply obtaining it without the\nnecessary warnings being given. So we would argue that\nis, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's parallel to the Fifth.\nMR. McALLISTER: It's parallel to the Fifth\nin this respect, and certainly, it's distinct from the\nFourth in that respect. But we don't think it matters\nat the end of the day. If one were to treat it like the\nFourth Amendment, so that the violation is complete when\nthe police send in an informant and he works hard to\nelicit statements in violation of the Messiah law, if\nit's complete at that time, then all of the analysis\nfrom the Fourth Amendment cases is equally applicable\nhere.\nIf the violation does not occur until it's\npresented at trial, then it's analogous more to the\nFifth Amendment and also to the Michigan v. Jackson and\nMichigan v. Harvey cases, which were Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel violations, in which case the Court\nsaid it was wrong for the police to initiate\ninterrogation after he invoked his right but will let\nthe statement be admitted for impeachment purposes. So\nit is exactly analogous to what the Court did in Harvey\nitself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it make no\ndifference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had\nbeen a police officer who was pretending to be a\ncellmate? In this case it was a snitch, but it could be\na police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't\ndo outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to\ninterrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda\nrights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to\nbe a jailbird and they can get the information that way.\nIs that --\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nbelieve that is correct if -- if it's for example, an\nundercover officer, someone has gone in -- in fact,\nthere are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that\ninvolved an undercover agent who was present for\nmeetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the\nCourt indicated that the presence alone would not\nviolate the right to counsel. It's the deliberate\nsolicitation and use of statements obtained from the\ndefendant that would violate the Sixth Amendment.\nSo if a cellmate, another defendant, is the\ninformant who listens and hears, it wouldn't make any\ndifference under the Court's cases if, in fact, it was a\npolice officer pretending to be a cellmate who listens\nand hears. Just as it wouldn't make -- it wouldn't be a\nviolation if there were a recording device in the cell\nand the defendant talked to himself, which there are\ncases of that, and it was picked up on the recording\ndevice. The mere listening, that goes to whether there\nis a violation at all. But the who, there is -- it\nwouldn't matter for our purposes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the police know that\nthey can get around the clear prohibition of their\nquestioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be\na jailbird?\nMR. McALLISTER: Potentially, yes. But,\nagain, the violation would go to what happens in the\ncell. So if the police officer is pretending to be\nanother defendant and sits in the cell and the defendant\nstarts telling the officer things, that would not\nviolate the Sixth Amendment at all under the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I am assuming we are\nnot in the area where the jail mate is simply passive.\nIn this case, the jail mate made a statement that\nencouraged the defendant. He wasn't just passive. He\nwas encouraging the defendant to speak.\nMR. McALLISTER: There was certainly\ntestimony about what he was told to do and what he did.\nIt does not suggest aggressive efforts, certainly, to\nfind out. He may not have been completely silent, but\nhe certainly didn't say, tell me what you did, let's\ntalk about your crimes. But he did make one arguably\nsuggestive statement to the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyway, your answer is\nthe police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?\nMR. McALLISTER: No, not that he could\naffirmatively elicit. That's the dividing line between\nthe Massiah and Kuhlmann case. He was in the cell --\nwell, I guess what I'm suggesting is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And for your -- you are\ntalking about impeachment only. We are not talking\nabout the case in chief. So if the police -- he\ncan't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and\ngives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?\nMR. McALLISTER: Outside -- well, it would\nstill be admissible for impeachment. We are asking for\nbasically the same rule. It would be the same thing if\nhe were in the cell, deliberately elicits, knows he is\nviolating Massiah, it couldn't be used in the government\ncase in chief, but it could be used for impeachment\npurposes. But that would be true of Miranda, if the\nofficer deliberately failed to give the warnings, got a\nstatement, they would not be admissible in the case in\nchief; but the Court cases are very clearly, it would be\nadmissible for impeachment purposes.\nSo we are asking for a precise parallel\nrule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are making no\ndistinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment?\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, there may be\ndistinctions, and there is an distinction in the text of\nthe Fifth Amendment that suggests actually a rule of\nexclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a\ncompelled statement. And the Court has recognized that\nin cases such as Portash, where the witness has given\nuse immunity, testifies before the grand jury and the\ngovernment later tries to use it against him. The Court\nsays, no, you cannot use that testimony for any purpose.\nSo there is a difference between the Sixth\nAmendment and Fifth Amendment in that respect.\nBut what I was suggesting is the way Massiah\nand Miranda operate is similar in this context, that a\nviolation results in suppression of the evidence from\nthe government's case in chief, but it remains available\nfor use as impeachment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument\nthat essentially this is like taking a pretrial\ndeposition, only one side isn't represented?\nMR. McALLISTER: Well, with all due respect\nto that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that.\nThere are strong incentives for the police, frankly, not\nto do this. And in part one of the reasons -- well,\nthere is two. One is the police know if this is truly\nin violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be\nused in the case in chief. So, at most, it is\nimpeachment if the defendant testifies and if the\ndefendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is\nelicited.\nBut furthermore, given the line the court\nhas drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on\nwith the informant in the cell, if they can hear the\nstatements without deliberately eliciting them, if you\nwill, if the informant is present, the defendant wants\nto talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those\nstatements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are\nadmissible for all purposes, because they are not a\nSixth Amendment violation at all.\nSo, the police do have some strong\nincentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if\nthey are going to, in a way that makes it usable in the\nprosecution's case in chief. It's much less value to\nhaving it solely for impeachment, which is always going\nto be speculative if it were ever going to be used. It\nwould depend on if the defendant testifies and if he\ntestifies inconsistently with what he has told an\ninformant.\nAnd in that regard, there are other\ndeterrents I would like to mention here as well. The\ninformant in this case, for example, in jail recognized\nthat he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or\nobvious as a government agent. In fact, he said, I\ndidn't really want to ask him questions because I was\nafraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get\nhurt. So, the informants have their own incentives to\nbe careful here.\nAnd in this case, it's also important to\nremember that deterrence is simply one side of the\nbalance. And the Court has said many times even if\nthere would be some deterrent effect to extending the\nrule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the\nquestion whether it should, in fact, be excluded. That\nstill must be weighed against the costs on the other\nside.\nAnd the Court has numerous cases emphasizing\nthe costs that are present on the other side of this\ncase. Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one,\nbut also cases talking about the importance of allowing\nthe jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.\nThe jury here gets to evaluate and did, I\nwould argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris's\nstandpoint, evaluate the defendant's credibility. The\njury was informed, cross-examination, of the informant's\ncircumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all\nthe things they might want to know in deciding whether\nto believe him. His testimony went not solely but\nprimarily to the question of who was the shooter in the\nmurder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris\nof the murder charge, so they did not believe, at least\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the\nshooter. And that is precisely how this should work.\nWe are not saying informants are always\n100 percent reliable, but we are saying the court has a\nlong tradition, the country has a long tradition, of\nputting this evidence in front of a jury. It's tested\nby cross-examination, knowledge of what the incentives\nare, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then\nthe jury decides. There are many of these cases where\n-- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, \"he was\nthe shooter,\" the other defendant saying, \"no, she was\nthe shooter.\"\nAnd the informant simply had information\nthat was relevant to the credibility. And that's the\nway it was used in this case, was as impeachment on\nrebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony in whether\nthe jury believed him or not.\nThe other thing I would remind the Court is\nwe are simply saying that the rule should be no\nexclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment\npurposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules\nof evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not\napply. They do. And they might well result in the\nexclusion of some potential informant's testimony. So\nif the government were to want to put on an informant\nwho had been convicted many times of perjury and the\njudge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is\ncredible enough to even put in front of the jury, not\nthis person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial\nprocedure would operate. Furthermore, as happened in\nthis case, the judge can, and often will, give\ncautionary instructions, limiting instructions. All of\nthat remains appropriate, but there is simply no reason\nto exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel.\nIt would be inconsistent, frankly, with --\nwith, really, the general tone and holdings of the cases\nin the Fourth Amendment, Miranda, and even Sixth\nAmendment territory, including primarily\nMichigan v. Harvey and Nix v. Williams.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I\nwill reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has consistently allowed the use\nof voluntary statements obtained in violation of\nconstitutional standards for impeachment purposes, and\nthat same rule should apply here. There is no question\nthat Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the\nsubstantial societal cost of allowing him to commit\nperjury unchecked greatly outweighs any speculative\ndeterrence benefit that would flow from a per se rule of\nexclusion.\nThe purpose of the right to counsel is to\nprovide an adversary process to ensure that the\ndefendant gets a fair trial. And to effectuate that\nright, the Court has excluded deliberately elicited\nstatements from the government's case-in-chief. But not\nallowing the statements for impeachment purposes doesn't\nfurther that right. Instead, what it does is allow the\ndefendant to distort the truth-seeking process, and\nthat's just too high a price to pay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say there\nis no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not\ngoing to do this if they know they are not going to be\nable to use this in their case-in-chief. But there is\nalso no down side, is there?\nI mean, you say it's only for impeachment\npurposes, but, you know, why not? He -- he may take the\nstand. He may lie. It is better to have this in the\nbank instead of not.\nMS. SAHARSKY: But there is a down side. I\nmean, as this Court recognized in cases versus -- like\nHudson v. Michigan, for example, the police have their\nown codes of conduct. They have training on\nconstitutional rules and standards. And if they violate\nthose constitutional rules and standards, it has real\neffect for the police. It has effect in terms of\ninternal discipline, in -- in terms of limiting their\ncareer opportunities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that internal\ndiscipline verifiable? Do police officers who engage\nsnitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they\nare then able to accomplish what was accomplished here?\nThat is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able\nto testify after the defendant testifies.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that there is\nany evidence in the briefs, and I am not aware of\nspecific instances of discipline, but I think that that\nis because this situation arises pretty infrequently.\nYou know, when this came up in the Kansas Supreme Court\nit was a case of first impression. And as General\nMcAllister noted, there are a lot of reasons why the\npolice would want to follow the rule in Kuhlman and send\nthe informant in to be a passive listening post.\nBecause if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the Federal level is\nthere anything one way or another, any manual that\ninstructs a U.S. Attorney about the use of snitches to\nextract confessions?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think the Department of\nJustice Manual sets out this Court's rules in terms of\nthe Kuhlman case and the Henry case. And then, of\ncourse, there are also State and the Model Professional\nEthics Rules that talk about when a prosecutor can\ncontact a person who is represented by counsel. And\nthere are limitations there as well, both in terms of\nthe prosecutor contacting a person represented or using\nan agent contacting a person represented.\nBut I mean, those are -- those are\ndeterrents. I think the police discipline is a\ndeterrent. But I think we also need to -- to focus on\nthis Court's cases in the Fourth and Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment Jackson context that taking the evidence and\nmaking it unavailable in the government's case-in-chief\nis a substantial deterrent.\nThis Court said in each of those previous\ncase that not having the evidence available in the\ngovernment's case-in-chief is a very high price to pay,\nbecause that means that the government has to come up\nwith other evidence that can meet its burden of proving\nall of the elements of the case beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\nAnd, as General McAllister noted, it is\nreally very speculative, and the police certainly\nwouldn't know at the time they are asking questions of\nthe defendant, whether this rebuttal impeachment\nevidence could ever be used. It's entirely within the\ncontrol of the defendant. It is only if the defendant\n-- if the government first meets its burden of proof\nwith other evidence at trial, and then the defendant\ndecides to testify, and then he testifies inconsistently\nwith his prior statements.\nAnd our position is at that point that the\njury should hear the conflicting evidence just as it has\nheard it in all of these other previous cases and be\nallowed to make a decision about who is telling the\ntruth.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you are\njust confirming the answer to the Chief Justice's\nquestion. There really isn't any down side. The worst\nthat -- the worst that happens is maybe they can't use\nthe stuff. But what -- what is the down side?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Again, I -- I think that\nthere is a down side in terms of police discipline and\nthe deterrence --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Has any police officer\never been disciplined for doing this; do you know?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I -- I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I would find it rather\namazing if he has.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think that most\npolice officers just follow the rule that this Court set\nforth in Kuhlman, so that this issue has not arisen\nfrequently. But, you know, even if you thought that\nthere would be some type of minimal deterrence benefit\nthat would arise from -- from not making the evidence\navailable for impeachment purposes, you have to balance\nit against the cost to the truth-seeking process that\nwould be incurred if the defendant could --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The defendant could\nsometimes lie. But sometimes people who are in this\nposition in prison are not the most trustworthy people,\neither.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You could bring that out\non cross-examination. I understand that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That -- that is what I was\ngoing to say. I mean, as General McAllister noted, that\n-- that happened in this case. The prosecutor himself\ngot up and talked about the -- the informant's prior\noffenses, why the informant was in jail, whether the\ninformant received anything in exchange for his\ntestimony, the fact that the informant had actually gone\nback to jail after testifying -- or after serving as an\ninformant in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that that\nall confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose.\nMaybe we have one witness who is not very persuasive,\nbut no harm in giving it a try.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that the -- the fact\nthat the evidence would be unavailable in the\ngovernment's case-in-chief really is a strong price that\nthe government pays. And -- and this Court recognized\nit in in Havens, in Walder, in Harris, in Hass, in\nHarvey, and in all of those prior cases. And there is\njust -- there is not any reason to depart from them,\nbecause the -- the other side of the balance is that,\nyou know, you are letting a defendant to get up and take\nthe stand and -- and not subject himself to this prior\nstatement.\nAnd this -- this prior statement, if\nbelieved by the jury, is incredibly important to his\ncredibility, probative with respect to whether the\ncrimes were committed and the defendant is telling the\ntruth.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it is truthfully\nreported. Of course, that is always -- that is an issue\nof credibility in all of these cases.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes, every case has a\nquestion about someone's credibility, some witness's\ncredibility, and that's for the jury to decide. And in\n-- in this case there was ample cross-examination, and\nthere was the limiting instruction that the State\nmentioned.\nI mean, clearly the jury did its job here\nbecause it went back and it considered all this\ninformation. And it didn't come back with a -- a\nverdict -- although you, of course, never know exactly\nwhat the jury is thinking, it didn't come back with a\nverdict suggesting it just reflexively believed the\ninformant's testimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, I am still a\nlittle hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a\nconstitutional violation. General McAllister said that\nin the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow --\nallow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that\nis the actual constitutional violation. Isn't that the\ncase other than in the Miranda situation? I mean,\nsuppose you have a generally coerced confession. Would\nwe -- would we permit that to go in?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Certainly not. In the Fifth\nAmendment context, the text of the amendment itself\nwould prohibit the use of that statement for any\npurposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, but why -- why is\nnot that the case with the right to counsel?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Because the text of the Sixth\nAmendment doesn't say anything about the exclusion of\nevidence at trial. What it does is it guarantees counsel\nfor a purpose, and that purpose is to ensure an\nadversary process at trial. And if counsel is not\nafforded, then it's up to the court to determine what\nthe remedy is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But its real meaning is\nthat counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. I missed the\nfirst --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Its root purpose is that\ncounsel is guaranteed at trial. And here we're saying\nit's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's\nrefuting a lie by the defendant.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's not true. I mean,\ncertainly counsel is available at trial. The question is\njust whether statements that were obtained without\ncounsel prior to trial can be used for impeachment\npurposes. The answer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that -- you say\nthe Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if I suggested\nthat. No, the Sixth Amendment violation occurs when the\nstatements are introduced in the government's case in\nchief at trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: And that's because the\ngovernment should not be allowed to go behind counsel\nprior to trial and gather up statements, and then use\nthem to prove guilt at trial. That subverts the\nadversary process. When you are talking about\nimpeachment, you are not talking about proving guilt at\ntrial. You are not talking about the government\ndistorting the adversary process. If there is any\ndistortion of the adversary process, it's with the\ndefendant attempting to commit perjury at that point.\nThe Sixth Amendment is different from the\nFifth Amendment in that it doesn't say anything about\nstatements that are obtained and if it can be used at\ntrial. And that means it's up to courts to balance the\ncost and benefit of exclusion of evidence. And in the\ncase of the government's case in chief, that balance\nmeans that that the statements cannot come in because it\nwould be too much of a cost to the adversary process\nthat the Sixth Amendment guarantees to allow the\nstatements in.\nBut, when you switch over in looking at\nimpeachment, this Court said 50 years ago impeachment is\na very different story than the government's case in\nchief. The interest that you are talking about\nfurthering there, the adversary process interest, would\nnot be furthered by allowing the defendant to take the\nstand and be able to commit perjury unchecked. It would\nnot be furthered, and it would not lead to greater\ndeterrence by simply allowing the statements to be\nunavailable for impeachment purposes, because the great\ndeterrent comes with the statements being unavailable in\nthe government's case in chief.\nWe just don't think there's any reason to\ndepart from this Court's rule that, so long as\nstatements are not involuntary, they can be used for\nimpeachment purposes.\nIf there are no further questions, we submit\nthe judgment below should be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Edge.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. EDGE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. EDGE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI guess I have basically three arguments\nwith the -- or problems with the State's position. First\nof all, what we are dealing with in the Sixth Amendment\ncase here is a violation of a core enumerated trial\nright, and this makes it a very different animal from\nall the other cases that we are talking about. If we are\ntalking about the Fourth Amendment, we are talking about\nsomething that isn't a trial right. It's a right of the\npeople to be secure in their homes and possessions. The\nviolation occurs when the police commit whatever\nmisconduct makes the search of the evidence illegal. But\nthe use of that evidence at trial doesn't work any\nfurther constitutional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wasn't this individual\nrepresented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?\nMR. EDGE: Yes, he was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And he was represented by\ncounsel at the time that the informant took the\nstatement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?\nMR. EDGE: No, I don't think so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have my memo that I\nhaven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite\ninterested. I thought he asked for counsel. He was\ngiven counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement\nwas elicited. I would like to know that because the\nSixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of\ncounsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had\na lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, \"Don't talk to\ninformants in the jailhouse.\" He could have said, \"I'm\ngoing to talk to who I want.\" Or he might not have. But\nI would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance\nof counsel at the time the statement was elicited? It's\none thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't.\nDon't know?\nMR. EDGE: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How can I find out?\nMR. EDGE: No, the -- I don't know exactly\nthe day that this happened. I do know that he was\narrested on the 16th of January of 2004, and there was a\nsearch of his cell on January 20th. And we know from\nthat testimony that -- why that's relevant that he was\ncellmates with Mr. Doser by that time, and Mr. Doser\ntestified that he was the cellmate of Mr. Ventris for\ntwo days. And on the second day, Mr. Ventris supposedly\nmade these statements.\nSo my best guess is that the -- this\nconversation occurred sometime between the 17th and the\n20th. Now, the order of appointing counsel was entered\non January 21st, and counsel doesn't enter his\nappearance until January 27th.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it might be he asked for\ncounsel but hadn't yet received counsel?\nMR. EDGE: Correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do I\nunderstand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to\nconcede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting\nthe introduction of these statements for impeachment?\nThe sentence says, \"A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule\nthat allowed use of uncounseled statements for\nimpeachment would not deter violations of the right to\ncounsel.\"\nMR. EDGE: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nthe reason I believe this is that, as long as there's\nsome kind of incentive for the prosecutor to use\ninformants in this manner, then the only -- then even if\nthey are not usable in the case in chief, there is still\nan incentive to use this kind of evidence, and the\nprosecutor and the police will attempt to obtain it.\nThere's simply very little downside. The prosecutor\ninstructs the informant not to deliberately elicit the\nstatement. The prosecutor is still responsible for the\ninformant, because the informant is his agent, so even\nif -- when the informant goes ahead and deliberately\nelicits the statement, it's still a constitutional\nviolation. But so long as you allow it for some kind of\npurpose, then there isn't a deterrent effect, and to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So in a situation like we\nhave here, where the law enforcement officers do not\ninstruct the informant to do anything that would violate\nthe Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their\ntestimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is\nconsistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no\ndeterrent value in later suppressing the use of the\nstatements for impeachment purposes?\nMR. EDGE: I mean -- I guess, maybe I am\nconfused. There is a deterrent -- there is a deterrent\neffect from suppressing it in the case in chief, but\nit's not sufficient unless it's also extended to use in\nrebuttal as well.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what do you want to\ndeter? You want to deter them from using informants at\nall, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth\nAmendment?\nMR. EDGE: No, Your Honor. What I am\nattempting to deter is the sort of up-ending of the\nadversarial system that this represents. There was a\nquestion that was presented earlier about when does this\nviolation occur? And I think that gets to the manner of\n-- or the nature of the Sixth Amendment violation. Our\ncontention is that the violation occurs when the\nstatement is extracted, and then it's further aggravated\nwhen it's used at trial. When the police obtain these\nkinds of statements, even if they are not used at trial,\nit does work a harm on the defendant and his\nrelationship with counsel. It affects defendant's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see the problem. I wonder\nif you have an answer to another question. You may not.\nI can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since\nthis -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the\nMichigan case. The other cases were decided even\nearlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has\nnever come up or rarely, rarely come up that the\nquestion of whether the State can introduce into\nevidence a statement made when the State questioned an\nindividual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of\nthe presence of the counsel.\nI mean, does that normally happen, or does\nit never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do\nyou have any idea?\nMR. EDGE: I do not, Your Honor. And I am\nreally at a loss to speculate as to why that would be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with the\nrepresentations on -- from your friends on the other\nside that there is no case of ours where we have\nexcluded a statement of evidence submitted for\nimpeachment, even though it would have been excluded in\nthis case in chief? If you prevail here, it would be\nthe first time that any evidence or statement has been\nexcluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?\nMR. EDGE: It would be a very different\nrule. I think the only rule that this would be the case\nso far is in Portash, the self-incrimination clause. We\nare saying that the same type of rule should apply to\nthe Sixth Amendment. Otherwise, no, that's correct,\nwhenever you are talking about the Fourth Amendment or\none of the prophylactic rules like Miranda or Jackson,\nthen they are admissible for impeachment purposes. What\nmakes this case different is that it -- it involves a\nviolation of an enumerated Constitutional trial right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I'm not certain\nabout. And this is why I ask -- have been asking these\nquestions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is\nthis.\nI ask for a lawyer. The State has some\nperiod of time to give me a lawyer. Now it's one thing\nif what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State\nshould deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they\nare supposed to do it. But that isn't as basic --\nthat's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil\ncontext and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if\nI ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give\nme one, though it should.\nThat's a different violation, a different\nkind of violation. One is a kind of a rule of ethics\nincorporated in the Constitution. The second is what\nthe case is -- is what the Constitution is really about,\ngive him a lawyer when he asks for one. And which is\nthis case? That -- that's why I'm having hard time. Is\nit the first or the second?\nMR. EDGE: Well, in -- I think one of the\ncomplicating factors here, Your Honor, is that the State\nin this particular case didn't try a straightforward\ninterrogation. They sent in an undercover informant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I will\namalgamate that for you. I will say they are exactly\nthe same thing. But what I want to know is what rule is\nviolated, what Sixth Amendment rule. The rule -- you\nheard what I said, the rule \"don't talk to a guy who\nwants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer.\" No\ncommunications with a client. It's a communication with\nthe lawyer. That's one thing.\nAnd the other rule is he has asked for a\nlawyer but you never gave him one. Now which is this\ncase? I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a\nlawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I\nthought they must have a reasonable time to give him a\nlawyer, and they haven't violated that second.\nIf you have any view on that, it would be\nhelpful to me.\nMR. EDGE: I don't know whether he had asked\nfor a lawyer or not. I know that he was entitled to one\nat the time, and one would be appointed for him. But\notherwise--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know that\nunlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no\nwarning here at all. I mean, he thinks he is talking to\na cellmate. Nobody tells him, \"remember you've got a\nright to be represented by counsel,\" and he's\nessentially giving a statement without the Miranda\nwarnings.\nMR. EDGE: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the other side says\nwell, practically, the defendant is much more likely to\nsay something that's really involuntary when he is\nconfronting police officers, that the reason that we\nexclude in the case of a police officer is this\nintimidating setting, when the defendant is in the\npolice station or in the cell and there are these police\nofficers. Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so\nthere isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that\nthere is when the police do the questioning.\nMR. EDGE: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthere certainly can be a coercive atmosphere even if you\nare not talking to a known police agent. Now, those are\nnot the facts of this particular case and there is no\nclaim that the statement was involuntary. However, one\nof the advantages of speaking to known police officers\nis that a defendant can simply end the interrogation by\ninvoking his right to counsel, and that is not\nnecessarily a course of action that is available to him\nif he thinks he is merely talking to a cellmate,\nsomebody who whether he wants to speak to him or not is\ngoing to be in the cell with him for some time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you've --\nyou've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from\nthe other ones where we have allowed evidence that would\nbe excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment\npurposes is that this is a trial right. But the Sixth\nAmendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right\nto the assistance of counsel. Well, he had assistance\nof counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did\nwas point out the problems with relying on the snitch's\nevidence and all the bad things that he did.\nBut -- but just like in the case of a Fourth\nAmendment violation where we allow the evidence to be\nadmitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you\nknow, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength\nof that distinction.\nMR. EDGE: Your Honor, I think it goes to\nthe nature of the harm that comes from a Sixth Amendment\nviolation. The Sixth Amendment simply doesn't limit\nitself to the trial. The exact wording of the -- the\nconstitutional provision is in all criminal\nprosecutions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me\nyou are getting away from the basis for your\ndistinction, then. Saying well, it's not just at trial.\nWell, these other constitutional rights where we have\nallowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are\nindistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right,\noutside of trial.\nMR. EDGE: Well, because the harm isn't\nsomething that just affects the outcome of the trial, it\nalso affects the -- it affects the litigation in a much,\nmuch deeper way. It affects counsel's trial strategy,\nit affects the defendant's decision whether or not to\ntestify. It also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pause on\nthat, it affects his decision to testify because it\nmakes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if\nhe is going to testify.\nMR. EDGE: Not necessarily.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The focus -- the\nfocus on the context is at least a double-edged sword\nbecause the harm that we are facilitating under your\nrule is to allow perjured testimony.\nMR. EDGE: Yes, Your Honor, in some contexts\nit would. I think one of the underlying assumptions of\nthe State's argument with regard to perjury is that the\nmere existence of a prior inconsistent statement is\nnecessarily indicative of perjury, and we know there are\nmany reasons why the defendant may have given a prior\ninconsistent statement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and if he has\nthe assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth\nAmendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out.\nHe was -- he was he is not lying now. The reason he\nsaid something different then was, you know, he likes to\nbrag in prison or whatever the basis is.\nMR. EDGE: In some cases it will be possible\nfor counsel to vigorously cross-examine the informant.\nIn others it may not. But in addition to that, Your\nHonor, I would also say that it doesn't simply affect\nthe decision whether or not to go to trial or whether or\nnot to testify at trial; it also affects the litigation\nin a very deep way, inasmuch as the defendant is\nburdened in trying to negotiate a favorable plea deal.\nEvery statement or every piece of evidence\nthat the State has affects their willingness to plea\nbargain, and when the State obtains this kind of\nevidence illegally, it puts the defendant in a bind for\n-- puts the defendant's counsel in a bind.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- I think\nthat's quite right. But I don't see how excluding the\nevidence even on impeachment helps that. I mean,\nthey've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you\nknow -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will\nget some leads from it even if they can't use it. But\nexcluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't\neliminate that harm.\nMR. EDGE: It would, Your Honor, inasmuch it\nwould remove any disincentive for the police to obtain\nthis evidence by this manner in the first place. So\nthere would be that marginal deterrent factor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Which of the things that\nyou've just said result from the use of this for\nimpeachment would not be true with respect to the other\nsituations where illegally obtained evidence has been\nused for impeachment purposes? Take the Fourth\nAmendment, for example.\nMR. EDGE: I think they would be largely the\nsame, Your Honor. The difference would be in the\ninterest protected. The self-incrimination clause in\nthe Fifth Amendment is aimed primarily at coercion of\nthe defendant; whereas, the Sixth Amendment aims\nprimarily at the preservation of an adversarial process,\nthe relationship between counsel and his attorney.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't dispute that there\nwas a Sixth Amendment violation at the time this\nstatement was taken, do you?\nMR. EDGE: No, I do not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You urged a -- a\nfall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there\nshould be a determination by the judge that the\ndefendant intentionally testified falsely. And I was\nwondering how that would operate. You are here in the\n-- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I\nwant to call snitch so-and-so. And then what do we do,\njust interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial\nto test the credibility of the -- the informant?\nMR. EDGE: Yes, you could, Your Honor.\nAlso, you could have it as part of the pretrial\nsuppression hearings. I would anticipate that even if\nthe -- if the Court were to adopt our position, these\nkinds of Sixth Amendment cases are still going to be\nlitigated. The issue is simply going to be whether or\nnot the States or the police agent is deliberately\neliciting the statement or not.\nSo there is -- there is likely going to be\nsome kind of pretrial litigation regarding the\nadmissibility of the statements, and it could be handled\nat that time.\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. McAllister, you have six minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McALLISTER: Two points by way of\nrebuttal. The balancing of the interests here is\nsprinkling water under the bridge even in the Sixth\nAmendment context. In both Nix versus Williams and\nMichigan versus Harvey where the Court was dealing with\nSixth Amendment interests and the Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel violations, the bulk of those cases make\nclear that the question of what exclusionary effect to\ngive a violation is subject to a balancing analysis.\nAnd that's what we are asking for here. That's why it's\ntreated for these purposes like the Fourth Amendment in\nthe Miranda context.\nAnd Nicks itself, to paraphrase the Court,\nmakes a fundamental point which I think illustrates how\nthis works, and it worked effectively to defendant's\nadvantage in this case.\nIn Nix v. Williams, the Court said the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel -- and I am paraphrasing\nslightly -- protects against unfairness by assuring an\nadversary process in which proffered evidence is tested\nby cross-examination. And it's done in front of a jury.\nIt is not about requiring the exclusion of entire\ncategories of witnesses or types of evidence for all\npurposes.\nSo the right to counsel was exercised. It\nwas exercised effectively in this case when Mr. Doser\nwas strongly cross-examined by defense counsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would that apply equally\nfor statements under oath?\nMR. McALLISTER: It could, Your Honor. I\nrealize a logical extension is you could say just test\nall of it. But that is where the -- the police here and\nprosecutor pay the price of the way in which the\nevidence was obtained. It's excluded from the\ngovernment's case-in-chief.\nUnless there are further questions, we would\nrespectfully ask that this Court reverse the decision\nbelow.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
