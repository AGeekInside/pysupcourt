BULLOCK, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioners\nWESLEY W. HORTON, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Respondents\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF\nSCOTT G. BULLOCK\nOn behalf of the Petitioners 55\n(10:12 a.m.)\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: We will now hear\nargument in the case of Kelo vs. City of New London.\nMr. Bullock.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT G. BULLOCK\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. BULLOCK: Justice O'Connor, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about whether there are any\nlimits on government's eminent domain power under the\npublic use requirement of the Fifth Amendment. Every\nhome, church or corner store would produce more tax\nrevenue and jobs if it were a Costco, a shopping mall\nor a private office building. But if that's the\njustification for the use of eminent domain, then any\ncity can take property anywhere within its borders\nfor any private use that might make more money than\nwhat is there now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bullock, you are\nleaving out that New London was in a depressed\neconomic condition, so this is distinguished from the\ncase where the State has no particular reason for\nwanting this, but the critical fact on the city side,\nat least, is that this was a depressed community and\nthey wanted to build it up, get more jobs.\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it's\nimportant to point out it -- in first place that\nchapter 132 of the statutory section at issue here\napplies to every city within the State of\nConnecticut, not those that are simply depressed.\nAnd there is a fundamental difference\nbetween an area like what was at issue in Berman, an\narea that actually had problems and a city that has\ncertain problems. Every city has problems. Every\ncity would like to have more tax revenue, but that\ncannot be a justification for taking the property --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you concede that on\nthe facts, more than tax revenue was at stake. The\ncommunity had gone down and down and the town wanted\nto build it up.\nMR. BULLOCK: It is a desire to try to\nimprove the economy through tax revenue and jobs.\nThat is certainly the case. But that cannot be a\njustification for the use of eminent domain because\nif the trickle down effects of economic development\nare a justification, then there really is no limit on\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't concede, or do\nyou, that elevating the city from a depressed to\nprosperous is a better justification than elevating a\ncity from prosperous to more prosperous?\nMR. BULLOCK: That is not -- that is\ncorrect, Your Honor. We do not. And chapter 132\nagain applies to not so prosperous cities and\nprosperous cities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The line you draw is\nbetween blight, which Berman says was in the public\nuse, lighted conditions okay, but depressed\nconditions, not the best in line with the --\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. We think\nthat that is a line that this Court has drawn that is\narea specific that focuses on the conditions in a\nparticular area. And the condemnations in Berman\nremoved the problematic areas. It removed the\nblight.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Oh, but Berman spoke,\nin the opinion, said that the determination of the\nlegislature about these things is virtually\nconclusive, that there is only the narrowest,\nnarrowest role for the judiciary. What kind of\nstandard are you proposing we should get into here to\nsecond-guess the public use aspect?\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, it is clear that\neminent domain power is broad, but there has to be\nlimits, and that's what we are really talking about\nhere.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, have we ever in\nany case from this Court said that the limit has been\nexceeded?\nMR. BULLOCK: In a few cases from earlier\nin this century, Your Honor, the Missouri Pacific\ncase, the Thompson versus Consolidated Gas case, but\nthis Court has recognized for over 200 years that\nthere are limits on eminent domain power, that they\ncannot be used for private cases. And that has been\na consistent strain throughout this Court's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Justice Douglas says\nthere that as long as it's an objective within\nCongress and legislature's legitimate grant of power,\nthey can do it, I mean, as long as there's a -- so\nwhy does there have to be a limit within that broad\nlimit?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, the limit\nis that there cannot be takings for private use.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, there can't,\npurely. But there is no taking for private use that\nyou could imagine in reality that wouldn't also have\na public benefit of some kind, whether it's\nincreasing jobs or increasing taxes, et cetera.\nThat's a fact of the world.\nAnd so given that fact of the world, that\nis law, why shouldn't the law say, okay, virtually\nevery taking is all right, as long as there is some\npublic benefit which there always is and it's up to\nthe legislature.\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, we think that\nthat cuts way too broadly. And it puts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. BULLOCK: Because then every property,\nevery home, every business can then be taken for any\nprivate use. For any private development project.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. It could only be\ntaken if there is a public use and there almost\nalways is. Now, do you agree with that, or do you\nnot agree with my last empirical statement?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, again, the eminent\ndomain power is broad, but there has to be limits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's, of course,\nmy question. The question is, if you agree with the\nempirical statement that there almost always is some\npublic benefit attached, then my question is, why\nmust there be a limit within that broad framework?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, I think\nwith public -- with just having a simple public\nbenefit, then there really is no distinction between\npublic and private uses. And that is what we call\nupon this Court to state, for instance, in the Berman\ncase and in the Midkiff case, which we think are\nreally at the outer limits of government's eminent\ndomain --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you think those\nwere correctly decided or do you take issue with the\ndecision in those two cases?\nMR. BULLOCK: We think that those\ndecisions can be consistent with ruling in favor of\nPetitioners in this particular case, Your Honor,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you take the\nposition that a city that is suffering from enormous\nlack of jobs and depression, economic depression,\nthat there is no public use purpose for taking land\nto enable the creation of jobs?\nMR. BULLOCK: That is correct, Your Honor.\nWe do not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume that\nthe city instead of taking the property by eminent\ndomain simply used its, its own -- some of its own\nregular tax income to buy up the property, and\nassembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling\nthem to an industrial developer to raise the tax base\nand hence ultimately to raise taxes.\nWould you say just within the meaning of\ngeneral understanding of proper governmental purposes\nthat the city was acting in a way that had no\nlegitimate public purpose?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthe question goes to whether or not the government\ncould use its police power to acquire property and\nthen sell it to a private developer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not interested\nin the label. I'm just saying if the government says\nwe need to increase the tax base because we have a\ndepressed city, so we are going to take some of our\ntax money now, and we are just going to buy up\nproperty that people are willing to sell to us, and\nwe are going to assemble parcels. And when we get a\nbig enough one, we are going to sell it to a\ndeveloper for industrial purposes. And that will,\nthat will raise the tax base. Is there anything\nillegitimate as a purpose for governmental spending\nin doing that?\nMR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor. We do not\nbelieve that that would be some legitimate because\nit's not a public use.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't there a public\npurpose here?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, because\nthis case affects the eminent domain power, which is\nregulated by the Fifth Amendment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we are talking\nabout -- I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I\nthought your point was that it was use of eminent\ndomain power for an improper purpose. And you\ncharacterize that purpose as conveying property to\nprivate owners.\nWell, in my example, the same thing is\ngoing on except that it's not using the eminent\ndomain power. If the purpose in my example is a\nproper public purpose, why isn't it a proper public\npurpose when the government does it by eminent\ndomain? What changes about the purpose?\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, because of the\npublic use restriction of the Amendment. That's what\nwe really --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bullock, do you\nequate purpose with use? Are the two terms the same?\nDoes the public use requirement mean nothing more\nthan that it have a public purpose?\nMR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your answer to\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if that is your\nanswer then the slum clearance cases have got to go\nthe other way.\nMR. BULLOCK: I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that is your answer,\nthen I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly\ndecided.\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, your Honor, this Court\ndid hold in Berman and Midkiff that the police power\nand eminent domain power are coterminous. That was a\nholding especially of this Court's opinion in\nMidkiff. And there are certain amici that have been\nfiled in this case, amicus briefs filed in this case\nthat have called upon this Court to re-examine that.\nAnd of course, this Court is free to do so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you are saying we\ndon't have to re-examine it, but I think your\nadoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a\ndifficult -- I think you're moving in the direction\nof saying we really have got to overrule the prior\ncases.\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I think under\na -- perhaps an original understanding of the takings\nclause, there was a difference between public use and\npublic domain.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Just for the moment, what\nabout my question? And you can get into history, if\nyou want to, and I tend to be interested in that, but\nmy immediate concern is, if you give the answer that\nyou have just given, doesn't it jeopardize the\nprecedent of the slum clearance cases?\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't think\nso, because of the caveat in Berman and Midkiff that\neminent domain cannot be used for private uses. And\nthat is what is really at issue here. What I think\nwas the focus of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what they\nwere being used for in Berman and -- everybody knows\nthat private developers were the beneficiaries in\nBerman.\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I believe the\njustifications focused upon the removal of the\noffensive conditions in Berman, that the public\npurpose, if you want to call it that, was served once\nthe blight was removed, the public purpose was served\nonce the oligopoly was broken up. Here the focus is\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As I understand, you're\ntest then -- you want me to make a distinction between\nblight which is a permissible governmental use,\ngovernmental objective and economic revival, which\nisn't?\nMR. BULLOCK: Under the eminent domain\nauthority, Your Honor, we think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the line you\nwant me to draw.\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes. And we think that that\nis a line --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose an\neconomist or even a judge might say, well, it's\nvery clear that if this economic depression continues\nfor another five years we are going to have blight.\nBlight is in the eye of the beholder, I know that.\nMR. BULLOCK: Exactly. And I think that\nthat is really one of the dangers of the majority\nopinion here is that it puts any property up for\ngrabs. Under the blight statutes, they actually have\nto -- governments have to meet a certain objective\ncriteria to satisfy that this is actually a blighted\narea.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it an\nobjective criteria to say that we are going to have\neconomic revival, avoid economic downturns?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, because, I\nthink -- to get back to the decisions in Berman and\nMidkiff, what this Court I think focused on there is\nthat the public use or the public purpose was direct\nand immediate. It was served directly by the\ncondemnations and it was immediately served by the\nremoval of the blight and the breaking up of the\noligopoly.\nIn economic development condemnations, the\nonly public benefits that come about, if they come\nabout at all, are completely dependent upon private\nparties actually making a profit. And that those\nprofits then somehow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the same thing\nthat is true in the railroads in the west.\nMR. BULLOCK: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Precisely the\ndescription you gave applied to the railroads in the\nwest.\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, those were\njustified under I think the line of cases that held\nthat those were really essential for land assembly\nfor instrumentalities of commerce. They were --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this seems to be\nreally essential for the purpose of developing\nindustrial property to increase the tax base. The\nargument is, and I don't know of any reason to doubt\nit, that doing it seriatim by voluntary acquisition\nand sale doesn't work.\nSo the rationale for this is essentially\nthe rationale for the railroads, for the public\nutility line condemnations and so on. There isn't\nanother practical way to do it. And there is a\npublic benefit at the end, and that ought to qualify\nit as a public use.\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, there are many\nways to do economic development without condemnation.\nIt happens every single day in this country. And in\nthe states that prohibit the use of eminent domain\nsimply for private business development, those states\ndo make the distinction between blighted areas and\nsimply their communities wanting to take advantage of\nmore tax revenue. And those states are doing fine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though in Berman,\nthere was a department store that was not blighted,\nand it was permissible because the whole area was to\nbe improved to raze that department store, even\nthough it wasn't contributing in any way to blight.\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. But the\nCourt in Berman held that there were certain\nproperties that even though they might have been\nnonblighted, it was essential to have those\nproperties in order to remove the blight from the\narea that was at issue. So there was the ability of\ngovernment to get certain properties even though they\nmight have been nonblighted. Here --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Bullock, would you\narticulate the test that you would propose the Court\nadopt. Some amici and others have argued that we\nshould use the substantially advances test, so-called\ntest from regulatory takings. What tests do you\narticulate?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, for our bright line\nrule, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. BULLOCK: The test should be that the\ngovernment cannot take property simply so that the\nnew owners can put it to ordinary private uses of\nland. That's really the test. And the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's not what's\nasserted here, of course. Here the city says, we are\ndoing this for purposes of enhancing economic\ndevelopment of a very poor city.\nMR. BULLOCK: True, Your Honor, but --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what do we do with\nthat alleged purpose? What is your test?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, the test, Your Honor,\nfor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it no economic\ndevelopment purpose?\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes. Yes. When it's only\njustified in order to gain the secondary benefits\nfrom ordinary private uses of land, and the way that\nbusinesses always make use of their land to try to\nmake money or to try to make a profit. That's our\nbright line rule.\nBut for our second test, if this Court\naccepts that economic development can be a public\nuse, then we advocate a test of reasonably\nforeseeable uses and minimum standards in order to\ncounter the dangers posed by such private involvement\nin the use of eminent domain power.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the latter. I\nmean, I understand the former. That's a big retreat\nand it comes to me now you're getting to what I\nthink is a possible realm of reason here. But the\nsecond part now you said and minimum standards.\nWhat minimum standards?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, the dissent in the\nConnecticut Supreme Court talked a lot about minimum\nstandards that should be in place in order to ensure\nthat public benefits actually come about. Those\ncould be such things as a commencement date for the\nproject, a construction schedule, financial\neligibility for the developers, there's a number of\ndifferent things.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean, are you\nadvocating particular ones?\nMR. BULLOCK: Not particular ones, just\nthe standard actually be in place and we think that\nthe dissent provides some good guideposts for\nestablishing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The remaining test is the\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that approaching --\nIsn't that in effect changing the test from public\nuse to efficient public use? I mean, what's -- you\nknow, if I condemn land for a public utility and the\npublic utility turns out to be very inefficient, has\nthe condemnation been invalid?\nMR. BULLOCK: No. Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want us to sit\nhere and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation\none by one?\nMR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, what we are\nadvocating for, and utilities of course are\njustified, have long been justified under a separate\nline of cases, common carrier regulations.\nBut what we are talking about are certain\nminimum standards in place at the time of\ncondemnation to try to have some type of reasonable\ncertainty that the public benefits are to come about\nso we are not talking about ongoing oversight. We\nare simply talking about minimum standards at the\ntime of the, at the time of the condemnation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it there isn't,\nbut maybe there is, there isn't any question in this\ncase that the city was acting in good faith and\ndid -- and I presume still does -- intend to convey\nit to developers who will, will actually proceed to\ndevelop a project. Is there a question about that?\nMR. BULLOCK: A question of whether or not\nthe procedure --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, in other words, I\ncan understand perfectly well, why we would want to\ndraw a distinction between the use of the eminent\ndomain power that takes a parcel of property from\nprivate person A and simply then reconveys it to\nprivate person B without any particular object in\nmind except that the city likes B, you know, the\nmayor is the Democrat and B is the Democrat. That\nkind of thing.\nSo I can understand the need for some\ndistinction between that case and what we've got\nhere. The question is when you say there have to be\nminimum standards, I guess, is do we have a problem\nhistorically or in this case about the good faith of\nthe taking so that we need the minimum standards to\nmake sure that we are not getting into the first\nexample?\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. And there\nis a number of reasons why there has to be reasonably\nforeseeable uses --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there a reason in this\ncase? Is there some doubt here?\nMR. BULLOCK: Well, it goes to the doubt\nabout whether or not the public benefits will\nactually come about in this case. The takings here\nare really for speculative purposes, pure speculative\npurposes. And that's where the minimum standards\ncome into play to ensure --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But do you really want\ncourts to be in the business of trying to weigh the\nevidence to see if the utility will be successful or\nthe hospital will be successful or the road will be\nwell constructed? I mean, what kind of a test are\nyou proposing?\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, our test is\nlimited really to the condemnations that are\ncompletely dependent upon the private businesses\nactually being successful, and that those benefits\ncoming about so it would not affect utilities or\nanything like that. But at a minimum, this Court\nshould require that the government actually name a\nuse.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does the record tell us\nanything about how often takings by eminent domain\nfor economic development occur in this country? Is\nit frequent? What are we dealing with?\nMR. BULLOCK: It is, it is frequent, Your\nHonor. There's no -- we do not know of any study\nthat looks specifically at condemnations for economic\ndevelopment, but after the Michigan court's decision\nin Poletown, they became commonplace.\nAnd you had properties -- business that\nwere being condemned for casinos, other homes that\nwere taken for automobile manufacturers. And the\nMichigan Supreme Court saw that as a disaster. And\noverturned that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In all of those cases, I\nthink the economic feasibility or economic success\ntest would have been easily met. I mean, what you're\ndoing is trying to protect some economic value/ But\nI think it's pretty clear that most economists would\nsay this development wouldn't happen unless there is\na foreseeable chance of success.\nLet me ask you this, and it's a little\nopposite of the particular question presented. Are\nthere any writings or scholarship that indicates that\nwhen you have property being taken from one private\nperson ultimately to go to another private person,\nthat what we ought to do is to adjust the measure of\ncompensation, so that the owner -- the condemnee --\ncan receive some sort of a premium for the\ndevelopment?\nMR. BULLOCK: There may be some\nscholarship about that. This Court has consistently\nheld that the property owner is simply entitled to\njust compensation of the appraised value of the\nproperty. Of course, the property owner --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you have to prescind\nthe project when you fix the value.\nMR. BULLOCK: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have to prescind the\nproject -- you have to -- you have to ignore the\nproject when you determine the value. The value is a\nwilling buyer and a willing seller, without reference\nto the project.\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes, that is right. And so\nthey simply get the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what I am asking is\nif there has been any scholarship to indicate that\nmaybe that compensation measure ought to be adjusted\nwhen A is losing property for the economic benefit of\nB.\nMR. BULLOCK: I believe there has been\nsome scholarship about it, but we think it's vital\nthat there be a public use requirement in those\ntakings as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you about the\nstandard. Go back for a second.\nMR. BULLOCK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I gather that the Iowa\ncourts have a standard that includes whether there is\na reasonable likelihood that the intended public use\nwill take place. Now, is that the standard you're\nadvocating?\nMR. BULLOCK: It's similar to our\nreasonable foreseeability test that we set forth in\nour brief that this Court actually talked about in\nthe Vester case as well, and a number of the other\nstate cases that are cited in our brief that\nestablish that there has to be a use for the property\nand that that use has to be reasonably perceived.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a lot of\ndisagreement about this?\nMR. BULLOCK: No, there's not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it seems to me\nyou might -- whether there is a reasonable assurance\nthat there will in fact be the public use which the\nstate uses as the justification for taking the\nproperty. Is that going to help you that much?\nMR. BULLOCK: I think it will provide\nimportant minimal standards of protection for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, I don't see\nhow this Court could get into the business of saying\nyou have to have this by a particular day or you have\nto have 14 witnesses. I mean, we couldn't impose\nthat sort of thing, could we?\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I think just the\nstandard needs to be in place.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There needs to be a\nreasonable assurance.\nMR. BULLOCK: Exactly. Or at the very\nleast, a reasonable foreseeability as well, which is\nat a minimum that is not even in place in this\nparticular case. And the majority of state courts\nthat have looked at this, that is a wel established\ndoctrine.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they might well\nneed it here.\nMR. BULLOCK: Not in this case, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you do that area\nby area? I mean, one of the points you made, this is\ndivided into what, seven areas?\nMR. BULLOCK: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there's some -- to\nbe developed first, you say that your clients lived\nin parcels that are not likely to be developed soon,\nif at all. So when making this determination, is\ndevelopment reasonably likely, do you have to do it\nparcel by parcel or can it be with the whole --\nMR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor. We believe\nit should be done where the property is actually\nbeing conveyed. And we think that that is the\nproper -- that is the proper test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not the area\ndevelopment but this house, will there be -- is it\nreasonably likely that there will be development in\nthat particular plot.\nMR. BULLOCK: In this particular parcel,\nthat is correct, Your Honor, and that has been\nsupported by ruling in just about every\ncondemnation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you, I'm\nsorry, I'll make this a quick question. Why do you\nthink it is necessary, given your position, why do\nyou think it's necessary to adopt the test you've\njust articulated as distinct simply from a good faith\nrequirement. So that if somebody objected and\noffered to prove bad faith, that would be in effect a\ndefense for the taking?\nMR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, because that\ndoes not really provide any protection to property\nowners. The intent to benefit a private party, and\nthe intent to benefit the public are really one and\nthe same in these types of condemnations.\nAnd we believe it is imperative at a\nminimum because the condemnations are dependent upon\nprivate parties even being successful that there has\nto be reasonable foreseeable uses. And also, if this\nCourt so chooses, minimum standards in place to\nensure that those benefits actually go to the public.\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Very well. Mr. Horton.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HORTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HORTON: Justice O'Connor, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe principal purpose of the takings\nclause is to provide for just compensation. Now, I\nwant to very briefly state two reasons why you do not\nwant to make a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it has to be\nfor a valid public use.\nMR. HORTON: Yes, it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.\nMR. HORTON: I completely agree with that,\nbut if the primary purpose of the takings clause is\nnot to regulate legislative determinations of that,\nbut it seems to me that what the opposition is asking\nfor is two tests.\nOne for Berman and Midkiff and National\nRailroad, and another test for Kelo. There is no\nprinciple basis for a court to make what is really a\nvalue judgment about whether a long-term plan to\nrevive an economically depressed city is a public use\nof a higher or lower rank constitutionally --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he doesn't -- he\ndoesn't, his second test does not adopt that. The\nsecond test which he was arguing at the end is just\nthat there has to be a reasonable assurance that the\npublic use, and it could include all those things,\nwill in fact take place.\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Justice Breyer. And I\nnoted his remark because that's actually in\nconcession because that's the test the Connecticut\nSupreme Court imposed. And they have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but what do\nyou think of that test?\nMR. HORTON: I don't, I don't agree. I\ndon't think it's necessary to do that, because if you\nhave that test, you have to say, well, what do I do\nabout, about other areas than this.\nBerman is an excellent example of that,\nbecause as Justice Ginsburg said, Mr. Berman's\nproperty was not blighted. You needed to take\nMr. Berman's property in order for the economic\ndevelopment that was going to occur later on.\nAnd the question is, was it reasonably\nassured that the economic development -- in fact,\nsome of the other side's amicus briefs say that that\nworked out terribly down there, and all it was was\ndiscriminating against the poor and, and poverty\nstricken people and it didn't accomplish any goal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, what, what\ndifference does it make that, that New London was in\nan economic depression? Would it not be fully as\nmuch, under your theory of a public use, for a city\nto say, yes, we are not doing badly, but we could do\nbetter. Let's attract some high-tech industry here.\nYou can't possibly draw a line between depressed\ncities and undepressed cities, can you?\nMR. HORTON: I would not draw a line.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't. And you\nwouldn't ask us to do it either.\nMR. HORTON: I would not ask -- I have a\nback-up argument that you do not need to reach that\nissue here in light of the facts of this case. But\nI -- to be candid with you, my view is that the test\nyou have is -- there is no principle --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any city can do it. And\nin the hypothetical that Justice Souter gave earlier\nwhere, you know, you couldn't take it from A and give\nit to B, because B is a good Democrat, you could take\nit from A and give it to B if B is richer, and would\npay higher municipal taxes, couldn't you?\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. But I have\na caveat on that. If you're talking about one\nproperty, you're very likely to have a Willowbrook\nversus Oleck problem about discrimination, you know,\nintentional discrimination against somebody else's\nproperty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I just want to take\nproperty from people who are paying less taxes and\ngive it to people who are paying more taxes. That\nwould be a public use, wouldn't it?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: For example, Motel 6\nand the city thinks, well, if we had a Ritz-Carlton,\nwe would have higher taxes. Now, is that okay?\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. That would\nbe okay. I -- because otherwise you're in the\nposition of drawing the line. I mean, there is,\nthere is a limit. I mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that, if that's\nso then the occasional statements that we see in the\nwriting that you can't take from A to give to B is\njust wrong?\nMR. HORTON: No. I don't agree with that.\nA good example is -- well, there is Missouri Pacific.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think you can't take\nfrom A to give to B, that there is some substance and\nforce to that proposition?\nMR. HORTON: There is some force to it. I\ncertainly wouldn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me qualify it. You\ncan take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes?\nMR. HORTON: If it's a significant amount.\nObviously, there is a cost --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll accept that. You\ncan take from A and give to B if B pays significantly\nmore taxes.\nMR. HORTON: With that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You accept that as a\nproposition?\nMR. HORTON: I do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But without the\naddition, I'd please like an answer to your question.\nMR. HORTON: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are statements in\nour cases that say you cannot take from A just to\ngive to B.\nMR. HORTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there\nis substance to that proposition and that that\nproposition is correct?\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. I do. And\nto --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that exactly\nwhat happened in Berman?\nMR. HORTON: Your Honor, in Berman, the --\nwhat has --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that exactly what\nalways happens unless it's for a firehouse or a\nschool?\nMR. HORTON: Your Honor, my position is\nthat purely taking from one person to give to another\nthat shows no public benefit other than just giving\nfrom -- taking from one person to another would not\nbe a public use.\nA good example is the Missouri Pacific\ncase. The one case in 200 years of this Court's\njurisprudence where you have, in fact, struck such a\ntaking that was not a regulatory taking.\nI would also point out that there are a\nfew cases around the country where it does not\ninclude Justice Scalia's hypothetical about\nadditional taxes.\nAn excellent example of that is the case\nthe other side has cited from New Jersey. Casino\nProperties versus Bannon, where the Trump Association\njust wanted a parking lot that was next door. There\nwas no assembly problem. No problem putting small\nparcels together. There was no talk in the case\nabout taxes or more taxes or more jobs or anything.\nIt -- the trial judge there didn't say it\nwas just for a public purpose -- a private purpose,\nbut he said it was overwhelmingly just for the Trump\norganization's -- so, I mean, if you include Justice\nScalia's hypothetical about more taxes, then I say\nthat's sufficient, as long as you get over --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what the\nConnecticut Supreme Court that we are reviewing said,\nyou -- you are arguing, it seems to me, for something\nthat goes beyond what was adjudicated in this case.\nI mean --\nMR. HORTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a finding, a\nfinding before to be a fact in the trial court that\nthis development was going to be primarily for the\nbenefit of the citizens of New London, and not for\nthe benefit of Pfizer or the private developer.\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. I agree\nwith that and that is why I say my back-up position\nis you don't need to determine whether you go beyond\neconomic depression of a city in this particular\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a factual\nfinding? You consider that a factual finding?\nMR. HORTON: I think it's a mixed question\nof fact and law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that this is\nprimarily for the benefit of the city of New London,\nnot for the benefit of a --\nMR. HORTON: I consider that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the eye of the\nbeholder, to whom do you think this does greater\nbenefit to, not a factual finding.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: When, when there is no\ncondemnation to acquire property for the direct use\nof the public, as for a public right-of-way, or a\nutility path or something, where it's purely economic\ndevelopment, is there any reason why we shouldn't\ndraw a clear line and say that isn't a public\npurpose. Let them go out and deal with -- buy it on\nthe market, on the open market. What's the matter\nwith that?\nMR. HORTON: Well, for one thing we have\nin this case, and this comes back to the point about\nthis particular case, is a severe assembly problem.\nWe have 115 properties we are talking about on this\n90-acre plot, and there is 32 acres that come from\none place, from --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's look at the\nspecifics here. Pfizer is already in place. That's\nhappened.\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what are these\nparcels of the people now before us going to be used\nfor?\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor. First of\nall, it's a long-range plan. If I could have, if I\ncould have the chart, please, if I may show you Your\nHonor.\nThe -- we are out on a peninsula here, and\nhere is Pfizer down here, which at the time of the\ntaking was almost completed. They moved in a month\nafterwards. Up here is an old state -- old fort from\nthe 19th century that the state agreed to turn into a\nstate park as part of an overall plan. The overall\nplan is this whole thing.\nNow, parcel one is going to be a hotel, is\nplanned for a hotel. Parcel two was planned --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Let's talk about the\nlitigants.\nMR. HORTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Before us today.\nMR. HORTON: Yes. That's right. They are\nin parcel 3 and they are in parcel 4-A. Now, the --\nit's to be developed in phases. The first phase is\none and two. The next phase is then three and four,\nA, and there is also a marina --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's planned for 3\nand 4-A?\nMR. HORTON: What's planned for 3 is that\nit's going to be office space. And the expectation\nis there is going to be a demand for class A office\nspace, which is the best quality office space in this\narea by 2010. And the expectation is that it will\nattract the sorts of offices that will feed on the\nPfizer. They spent $300 million on a site here.\nIn addition, I may point out, this is the\nAmtrak line going along here. The only way you can\nget to parcels 1 and 2 is to go right by parcel 3 or\ngo right by parcel 4-A.\nThis is a waste water treatment facility.\nParcel 4-A is for park support or marina support.\nNow, it isn't more definitive, but obviously, one\npossible use is for parking here because you've got a\nwaste water treatment facility here. You've got the\npark here. You've got the marina here and you've got\nthe other parcels here.\nIt's not like we are talking, as in\nBerman, you're talking about something that's in the\nparcel. And in Berman, they said it's not for the\ncourt to decide where the boundary lines ought to be.\nIt seems to me that's another point, Justice\nO'Connor. It's not like parcel 3 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't the courts at\nleast -- can't the courts, could the courts -- do you\nobject to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want\nyour reaction.\nMR. HORTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could the courts, under\nthis clause, at least review what you've just said\nfor reasonableness? I mean, look at the\nreasonableness of a claim that this is for --\nbasically for a public use. Look at the\nreasonableness of the claim that we should do it this\nway, rather than excusing the people who don't want\nto sell their houses no matter what and doing it a\nlittle bit differently.\nReasonableness is a concept that's already\nin the Constitution in terms of what the legislature\ncan do, but I'm thinking of the stronger kind of\nreasonableness review that you might have in an\nadministrative action. Now, is, Overton Park, if you\nwant a case. Is that a possible kind of review that\nyou might find appropriate here?\nMR. HORTON: No, Your Honor, if what\nyou're defining as reasonableness is being higher\nthan rational basis. Because in that situation,\nyou're applying a higher standard for a taking where\nwe are paying for it than you would be for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the reason that you\nwould apply a somewhat higher standard is because the\nrational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to\nthe power of Congress to act in an economic area in\nthe absence of a particular constitutional provision\ndesigned to protect a minority from the actions of\nthe majority.\nAnd if you read that public purpose\ndoctrine, a section here as having that in mind, you\nmight want a somewhat higher level of review. Now,\nthat's the whole thing spelled out. I'm not\nadvocating it. But I am putting it forward to get --\nto get your reaction.\nMR. HORTON: Your Honor, that same type of\nremark could be made about rational basis equal\nprotection review.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, and indeed with equal\nprotection, we very often do have a somewhat higher\nstandard of review.\nMR. HORTON: Ah, yes, Your Honor, but the\npoint here is that you should not have a higher\nstandard of review because we are paying for it. It\nwould be ironic to have a higher test than for\nexample in a regulatory taking or even the same test.\nYou have a test in Nollan and Dolan, for example,\nwhich is an exactions case. So that's to say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, you're paying\nfor it, but you're also taking property from somebody\nwho doesn't want to sell it. Does that count for\nnothing? Yes, you're paying for it, but you're\ngiving the money to somebody who doesn't want the\nmoney, who wants to live in the house that she's\nlived in her whole life. That counts for nothing?\nMR. HORTON: No, of course not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, let me ask --\nwould, would the reasonableness standard, if the\nproject is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine\nprospect that all of these good things that you're\ntalking about will happen, why wouldn't private money\ncome in to further the project? Why is it necessary\nto condemn it if it's so reasonable. Why couldn't\nyou, you -- now, you say there is a holdout for one\npart, parcel. Couldn't the city fund a private\npurchase of that parcel? Say, you know, we'll make\nfunds available out of our general tax revenue to\nsomebody who wants to come in and put together this\nsystem? Of course, that person has to buy out\nproperty owners, but we'll, we'll give you money to\nbuy them out at high prices.\nMR. HORTON: Your Honor, there are some\nplaintiffs who are not going to sell at any price.\nThey want to stay there. You've got a severe\nassembly problem in this case and it's not as though\nyou can say, well, go somewhere else.\nYou have a situation where you've got the\nPfizer plant that is being built there. You've got\nthe state park that's there. You've got this Naval\nunderseas facility that just came on the market.\nThat's the only place anything is going to work and\nit's -- and it's five to six square miles of town. I\nmean, there is no other place to go.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How much, how much of\nthis was voluntarily sold, is that correct?\nMR. HORTON: The large share of it was,\nbut of course, that's because there is always in the\nbackground the possibility of being able to condemn\nit. I mean, that obviously facilitates a lot of\nvoluntary sales. And if, if this is not -- if this\nis not -- let me put it this way. I mean, there is\ngoing to be a more severe holdout problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That may be. Now, that's\nwhy I'm back to reasonableness. You see, we are told\nin the briefs that the people who often might hold\nout, might be doing so to get more money, but it\nmight also be because they are poor, they are not\nwell connected politically, and their only hope is to\ngo to a court and stop this thing.\nSo you'd give them two weapons. Weapon\none is you have to pay them. That's correct.\nCompensation. And weapon two is they can put you to\na test of being reasonable. That might be quite a\ndeferential test, so you might have every leg up.\nBut they at least could catch the instances where\nthis is really not reasonable to do to them what\nyou're doing to them that they don't want.\nMR. HORTON: I have two responses to that,\nYour Honor. First of all, that applies to all sorts\nof takings. If I'm building a road, let me give you\nan example of the Rindge case that Your Honors\ndecided in the 1920s.\nThat was the road to nowhere. It was a\nroad that went through a farm to the county line.\nAnd the other county had no intention at that point\nof building a road, but Your Honors said, well, they\nmight get around to it at sometime so it's a good\nidea to build it now.\nWe had a similar situation in Hartford.\nThere is supposed to be a ring road around Hartford,\nand the State condemned all this land for a ring road\naround Hartford. Well, one little bit of it was done\nand then just this, this year, in very low print in\nthe last page of the newspaper, we see about the\nstate getting around to selling the land because they\ndidn't, they didn't do it.\nI mean, this can happen in the railroad\ncase is a good example. The railroad case. The one\nYour Honors decided. If it's -- being a common\ncarrier makes all the difference, then how come the\nICC just didn't order the Boston & Maine to fix the\nrailroad? You know. Why? You know, you didn't look\nto make a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Common carriers are\nsubject to state regulation to a degree that private\ncompanies are not. They must, they must treat all\ncomers alike. I mean, I don't think the public\nutility cases are at all comparable to condemning\nland in order to get a new company to move in and pay\nmore taxes. I just don't think it's similar.\nMR. HORTON: Well, I would like to point\nout that the -- there is a difference, the whole\npoint is about having a test about reasonable\nassurances about whether something is going to happen\nand that's where the railroad case makes a\ndifference.\nQUESTION: I agree with you on that.\nMR. HORTON: That's the only point I was\nmaking, Your Honor. I didn't mean to go further than\nthat. But coming back to Justice Breyer's point, you\nmade a point about poor people. And I'd like to\npoint out, unless you're going to overrule Berman,\nyou know, poor people and minorities are more likely\nto be vulnerable in the blight cases than in this\ncase.\nI mean, this is a good example. Economic\ndevelopment can take place anywhere in town. Blight\nhappens in one area of town where the poor and the\nminorities are likely to live, and in fact, this very\ncase, we have got middle class people. There is no\nblight that's been alleged in the condemnation\npapers.\nThe other thing is if you stick to blight,\nthis is the problem you're going to have. You're\ngoing to end up making a blight jurisprudence\nbecause -- because what's going to happen is the\ncities are going to say, we can only do this by\nblight, so they are going to have marginal\ndefinitions of blight.\nFlorida, for example, says property is\nblighted if it's vacant. Is that blight? I mean,\nyou're going to have a big headache in that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm accepting that\nyou can't make that kind of a distinction. That's\nwhere I'm focusing on a test that would possibly\napply only where you transfer property from one\nprivate person to another, but still wouldn't make\nthose distinctions of blight or not blight.\nMR. HORTON: Yes. But I mean, the other\nthing is, are you going to make -- would the Court\nmake a distinction between a case where the city is\ndoing the developing itself, and another case where\nthe city gives it to a private person.\nI'd like to point out, my client is going\nto keep the property. It's -- it's going to be\nleased to a developer. It's not going to be sold to\nthe developer. So I mean, if this developer builds a\nbuilding on this property, and then doesn't comply,\nthey are in big trouble.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem ironic that\n100 percent of the premium for the new development\ngoes to the, goes to the developer and to the\ntaxpayers and not to the property owner.\nMR. HORTON: Well, that's an interesting\npoint. A question was raised earlier about the other\nside about whether there should be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The compensation\nmeasures.\nMR. HORTON: The compensation measures.\nExactly. By the way, the answer to your question is\nif there is some -- if there is some scholarly\narticles on that, I'm not aware of it either.\nBut I would point out that's something,\nyou know, in terms of social costs and things like\nthat, that is something that this Court might or\nmight not wish to consider in a just compensation\ncase, but I don't think it should affect whether you\ntake the property or not. It seems to me that is --\nI'm not taking a position on that one way or another,\nbut it seems to me that's -- you have to assume in\nthis case that there is going to be just\ncompensation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On that point, just in\nConnecticut, if the property owner goes to the jury\nand receives more than the state offered, does the\nstate also have to pay those attorneys' fees?\nMR. HORTON: Under -- under state law?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under Connecticut law,\nif the property owner is offered $100 but goes to the\njury and gets $200, does the property owner have to\npay the attorneys' fees or does the state pay the\nattorneys' fees?\nMR. HORTON: The state does not pay\nattorneys' fees, Your Honor. Everybody pays his own\nattorneys' -- and likewise, the other way, if it's\nlower amount than what was put in than, you know,\nit's not as though the state gets attorneys' fees\nback. It works both ways.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Horton, what do you\nthink is the reason that there are not a lot of\nexamples of the sort that I think one of Justice\nO'Connor's hypotheticals raised, in which the, I\ndon't know, the Econoline Motel gets condemned so\nthat the Ritz can be built, thereby increasing tax\nrevenue and so on, kind of parcel by parcel\naugmentations to the tax base and so on. Why aren't\nthere a lot of examples like that?\nMR. HORTON: I think there is two good\nreasons for it, and that it's a theoretical more than\na practical problem. First of all, you've got all\nsorts of transaction costs when you, when you go\nthrough eminent domain, as opposed to doing things\nvoluntarily.\nSo you are not going to do things -- as a\nas a practical matter, to take Justice Scalia's\nearlier example, for one piece of property because of\nthe transaction costs involved. I mean, you're never\ngoing to make up -- unless it's to, you know, to\nfavor the governor's friend or something like that,\nas you say.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In which case we have a\ndifferent --\nMR. HORTON: In which case you have a\ndifferent problem. The Willowbrook versus Oleck\ntest.\nQUESTION: Okay. So we have transaction\ncosts.\nMR. HORTON: Transaction costs, but that\nis a serious problem. And the other thing, there is\nthe democratic process, Your Honor. I mean,\nespecially if the taxpayers are paying for something\nand you know, they are getting a bad reason or run\naround about the reason, you know, that's subject to\nreview.\nIt seems to me democracy can make good\ndecisions and -- or bad decisions under the\nConstitution, but the important thing is that when\nit's paid for, it's not like regulatory takings which\nare, you know, the taxpayers don't see that until\nit's too late. You know, in this type of taking, the\ntaxpayers are seeing up front what's going on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But now,\nput yourself in the position of the homeowner. I\ntake it, if it's a forced sale, it's at the market\nvalue, the individual, let's say it's someone who has\nlived in his house his whole life. He bought the\nhouse for $50,000. It's worth half a million. He\nhas 450,000 profit.\nHe pays 30 percent to the Government and\nthe state in taxes, and then he has to live\nsomewhere. Well, I mean, what's he supposed to do?\nHe now has probably 350,000 to pay for a house. He\ngets half a house because that's all he is going to\ndo, all he is going to get for that money after he\npaid the taxes, or whatever.\nAnd I mean, there are a lot of -- and he\nhas to move and so forth. So going back to Justice\nKennedy's point, is there some way of assuring that\nthe just compensation actually puts the person in the\nposition he would be in if he didn't have to sell his\nhouse? Or is he inevitably worse off?\nMR. HORTON: Well, I mean, first of all,\nthe -- in Connecticut, fortunately, we have\nrelocation loans which are involved here. And they\nare available in this case.\nThere was, it wasn't clear from our brief\nwhether they were loans or not, and it is correct\nthat they are loans. The other side pointed out that\nthat was for all projects in the state. That's not\ntrue, you know, I mean, there is $10 million involved\nin relocation funds.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the loans don't make\nhim whole. Isn't --\nMR. HORTON: That's true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, what bothered\nJustice Breyer I guess bothers a lot of us. And that\nis, is there a problem of making the homeowner or the\nproperty owner whole? But I suppose the answer to\nthat is that goes to the measure of compensation\nwhich is not the issue here.\nMR. HORTON: Yes. And that's, and I had\nsaid that earlier. But another point when I was\ntalking about roads is that applies to -- that could\napply to any type of case. It doesn't just apply to\na case like this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would really\noverrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw\ncondemnation law into chaos.\nMR. HORTON: Yes. And Justice Scalia, a\nquestion you -- or actually it was a comment you had\nmade about public use versus public purpose. And\nthat would not only overrule -- and my opposing\ncounsel said there is a difference between the two.\nAnd when pressed by Justice Souter -- and I would\npoint out, that's just overruling cases going back to\nBerman. That's overruling two decisions by --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the remedy?\nLet's repose the problem to which I want to remedy\nthen. And maybe this isn't the right remedy.\nBut the remedy that they are saying, and\nI'm really repeating it, is an individual has a house\nand they want to be really not made a lot worse off,\nat least not made a lot worse off just so some other\npeople can get a lot more money. Now what, what is\nthe right -- is there no constitutional protection?\nIf this isn't the right case, what is?\nMR. HORTON: Well, the right case is in\nthe just compensation concept, but going to your,\nyour point, if this were here as just compensation, I\nwould say in terms of just compensation, in deciding\nwhat the fair market value is today, you can\ncertainly take into account the economic plan that's\ngoing into effect. You know --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? I thought that\nthat was a fundamental of condemnation law that you\ncan not value the property being taken based on what\nit's going to be worth after the project. That's\njust --\nMR. HORTON: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Unless Connecticut law\nis much different from any other state.\nMR. HORTON: I may have misspoken on that\nsubject, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't misspeak. But\nyou know, in any case --\nMR. HORTON: I apologize, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What this lady wants is\nnot more money. No amount of money is going to\nsatisfy her. She is living in this house, you know,\nher whole life and she does not want to move. She\nsaid I'll move if it's being taken for a public use,\nbut by God, you're just giving it to some other\nprivate individual because that individual is going\nto pay more taxes. I -- it seems to me that's,\nthat's an objection in principle, and an objection in\nprinciple that the public use requirement of the\nConstitution seems to be addressed to.\nMR. HORTON: But as I say, Your Honor, if\npublic use and public purpose are the same thing,\nwhich they are unless you're going to overrule\nHolmes' decisions from 1905 and 1906.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't the first of\nHolmes' decisions to be overruled.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I think you'd\nhave to take some substantial chunks of language out\nof Berman as well, because Justice Douglas spoke very\nexpansively in that case.\nMR. HORTON: Plus I think Holmes was right\nwhen he said that to say that the public actually has\nto use the property is not an appropriate meaning of\nthe phrase, so I would not think you'd want to\nrevisit that case, even if you want to revisit some\nother of Holmes' decisions.\nBut the -- I guess the best answer I have,\nJustice Breyer, to your question, after I, after I\nmisspoke is simply to go back to the point that the\ntime at which you consider what just compensation is,\nis in the just compensation proceedings.\nAnd while I misspoke about what the test\nwas, and I apologize for that, certainly this Court\ncan consider if social costs should be taken into\naccount at that time. I'm not saying they should. I\nhaven't thought that through as can you obviously see\nby my misanswering the question, but it seems to me\nbecause my primary answer is that you don't look at\nthat now.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, the tax\ncode does have special provisions for involuntary\nsales and reinvestments.\nMR. HORTON: Yes, it does.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The tax hypothetical is\nnot accurate.\nMR. HORTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Horton, I'm not\nproposing that the state has to use the property\nitself. I'm simply proposing that its use not be a\nprivate use which has incidental benefits to the\nstate. That is not enough to justify use of the\ncondemnation power.\nMR. HORTON: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can give it to a\nprivate entity, you can give it to a railroad, to\nsome public utility. But the use that it's put to by\nthat railroad and public utility is a public use.\nThat's why it's a public utility.\nIt's quite different to say you can give\nit to a private individual simply because that\nprivate individual is going to hire more people and\npay more taxes. That, it seems to me, just washes\nout entirely the distinction between private use and\npublic use.\nMR. HORTON: Well, I don't agree, Your\nHonor, because I think, you know, I think if a person\nis without a job and if a person is not able to get\nbasic services that they need from the town because\nthe town can't afford it, that's just as important as\na trains running on time or eliminating blight.\nAnd Justice Breyer, I thought of another\nanswer to your question that has to do with this\ncase. And that is even on a higher test, we win\nbecause the Connecticut Supreme Court applied a\nhigher test in this case.\nAnd just -- I would say that in this case,\nthe essence of federalism is to let various courts\nmake various decisions about what they consider an\nimportant public purpose. It may be different in\nUtah from the way it is in Connecticut, and it's\ndifferent in Florida, and I don't think this Court\nshould be having a new jurisprudence for this area\nand having two separate tests, and maybe having a\ntest that even approaches the Nollan Dolan test where\nyou certainly want to discourage people from taking\nthese actions.\nAnd so it seems to me the four words I\nthink that this Court should consider -- and I'm not\ngoing to tell you the four words since my red light\nis on. Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Bullock, you have\nthree and a half minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY SCOTT G. BULLOCK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Bullock, do you know\nthose four words?\nMR. BULLOCK: I wish I did. I could\nrespond to it if I -- if I actually did. Your\nHonors, first of all, just a couple of matters\nregarding the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision.\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court did not apply the test\nthat we suggest in our case, they explicitly, the\nmajority explicitly declined to apply heightened\nscrutiny in this, in this instance.\nI think the key to understanding their\nargument is the answer to the question of, can you\ntake a Motel 6 and give it to a fancier hotel? Their\nanswer is yes. And that's what's really at stake\nhere.\nThese condemnations are taking place\nthroughout the country. A city in California\ncondemns the 99 cents store in order to give it to\nCostco. Now, were they giving enormous benefits to\nCostco? Of course they were. But they did so\nbecause they wanted to get the tax revenue, and\nthat's the problem with these types of condemnations,\nthe desire to help a private party and the desire to\nhelp the public are really one and the same. The\npublic only benefits if the private party is\nsuccessful.\nThe NLDC is a private body. It has a\nprivate board of directors, and it is leasing land to\na private developer for 99 years at $1 a year. That\nis private ownership of land.\nAlso, Your Honors, there is no severe\nassembly problem in this particular case, and in many\nother development situations. The NLDC and the city\nhave 32 acres that was given to them by the Federal\nGovernment for them to do as they wish. And our\nhomeowners who have lived there a long time and wish\nto hold on to their properties do not object to that\ndevelopment going on. It is within the rights of the\ncity and the NLDC to do so.\nAlso, Your Honor, the Rindge case that was\ncited by the Respondents, they actually knew what was\ngoing to go on in that, in that case. They knew what\nthe use was going to be.\nAnd finally, Your Honors, the Respondents\ntalk about the effect that this may have upon poor\npeople. Not all neighborhoods, not all poor\nneighborhoods are blighted. But the one thing that\nall poor neighborhoods share in common is that they\ndon't produce much in the way of tax revenue, so\nyou're going to put poor neighborhoods and working\nclass neighborhoods like the ones that exist in Fort\nTrumbull in jeopardy if the Court affirms the\ndecision below.\nAnd that's why so many organizations that\nare concerned about the rights of senior citizens and\nthe rights of minorities and poor folks like legal\nservices corporations have joined in our side to\nsupport the property owners in this case. If there\nis no further questions, Your Honors, I will close.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you Mr. Bollock.\n(Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
