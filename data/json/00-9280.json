        "content": "(10:59 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-9280, William Arthur Kelly v. South\nCarolina.\nMr. Bruck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRUCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFor the second time this year, the Court\nconsiders today South Carolina's compliance with your\ndecision in Simmons v. South Carolina. The issue this\ntime is -- is the interpretation, if you will, the South\nCarolina Supreme Court has placed upon the future\ndangerousness requirement of the Simmons decision,\nspecifically whether, as the South Carolina Supreme Court\nput it, future dangerousness was neither a logical\ninference from the evidence nor was it injected into this\ncase through the State's closing argument.\nQUESTION: Well, in -- in some sense -- and this\nis what concerns me about your argument -- I -- I suppose\nat some level future dangerousness is -- is always\ninferable from the fact of -- of a horrible crime.\nMR. BRUCK: I -- I think it is true that -- that\nwhen a person is convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of an\naggravated, death-eligible murder, it is -- it does not\ntake very much more to put the issue of future\ndangerousness at issue. You can conceive of crimes -- I\nparticularly suggest the example of an intrafamilial --\nthat is, the murder of children by their mother where the\nperson with no prior record and no likelihood that the\nsituation will recur, where future dangerousness simply\ndoes not sound from the evidence.\nHowever, in -- there are also --\nQUESTION: We -- we are the ones that -- that\ngave you this -- this category of future dangerousness.\nAnd it either makes sense or it doesn't. If -- if there's\nsomething defensible about the category, it -- it seems to\nme that there would be a significant number of cases in\nwhich it doesn't apply. I -- I just don't see that from\nyour argument. Now, maybe the category is unworkable.\nThat's another point.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, I should say that future\ndangerousness is not likely to be at issue in -- in cases\nwhere State law does not provide the jury the freedom to\nconsider it. If aggravation was clearly limited in a\nweighing statute in which the jury has clearly said these\nare the -- or is clearly told, these are the factors that\ngo on death side of the scale and nothing more -- only you\ncan think of a way in which the prosecution could try a\ncase in a way that clearly conveyed the message to the\njury that --\nQUESTION: Well, how many States that use the\ndeath penalty allow future dangerousness as a factor in\nsentencing?\nMR. BRUCK: You know, I don't have an exact\nnumber. My sense is that a small minority have it as a\nstatutory aggravating factor, such as Texas, Virginia, and\nOregon, and a much larger number like Georgia, South\nCarolina allow it along with a myriad of other sentencing\nfactors without it ever needing to be explicitly\nmentioned. These are the so-called non-weighing States.\nI would guess --\nQUESTION: Well, that is the concern, of course,\nis if -- whether this concept is something that is going\nto have to be applied in every capital sentencing case or\nwhether there's some limitation.\nMR. BRUCK: Well --\nQUESTION: And it's hard to know from your\nargument the answer to that. Can you draw a line?\nMR. BRUCK: Yes. I would say where the evidence\ndoes not sound in future dangerousness and where the\nprosecution does not advance the jury's consideration of\nfuture dangerousness. For example, in this case, you\nknow, on these facts, of course, none of this is\nimplicated. This is simply Simmons. This is within\nSimmons. Even if we were to limit Simmons to its facts,\nit would include this case because you have an onslaught\nof future dangerousness argument. You have an onslaught\nof classic future dangerousness evidence presented --\nQUESTION: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You\nsay evidence sounds in future dangerousness. What -- what\nevidence that -- that is introduced at -- you know, at the\n-- at the sentencing phase that this is a horrible person\nwould -- would not sound in future dangerousness? You're\ntrying to show that this is a horrible person, that he\ndeserves the death penalty. What kind of evidence\nwouldn't sound in future dangerousness?\nMR. BRUCK: Well, for example, the prosecutor\nhere took on the issue of the fact that this young man was\nonly 17 years old, and his -- and had no prior record,\nboth very substantial mitigating factors. And the\nresponse was that actually the very fact that he had no\nprior record, the prosecutor said, makes him more\nfrightening than a serial killer, more frightening than a\ncareer criminal, which is all future dangerousness\nrhetoric. Frightening means looking toward the future.\nOne is not frightened by things that have already\nhappened, but things that might happen in the future.\nQUESTION: Now -- now, you're relying on the\nstatement of -- of the prosecutor --\nMR. BRUCK: Yes, in part.\nQUESTION: -- on his use of the word\nfrightening. And in another place, he does use the term\ndangerousness.\nMR. BRUCK: Yes, he does.\nQUESTION: Now, that's one thing if you want to\n-- and -- and we -- we can discuss that. But -- but I'm\nmore concerned about your broader point that when the\nevidence, as you put it, sounds -- I'm not sure it's the\nproper use of sounds, but when the evidence, as you put\nit, sounds in future dangerousness, we have to -- it -- it\nis constitutionally required that you -- you have the\ninstruction about no parole.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, I mean, we should recall that\n-- that -- I mean, one can say, well, these are just the\nfacts of the crime. The State has enormous discretion\nabout what evidence it wants to present, and when it\npresents evidence that is reasonably likely or, in this\ncase, virtually certain to cause the jury to consider the\n-- the elemental sentencing issue that a judge considers\nin almost every case, will he do it again, then --\nQUESTION: That will always be the case. You --\nyou are asking for a rule that -- that will cover every\ncapital case. I cannot imagine a capital case where --\nwhere the prosecution does not, at the sentencing phase,\nput in evidence that makes this look like a horrible\nperson, hence, a dangerous person. And -- and I -- you\nknow, I just don't know that we're prepared to go that\nfar.\nWhich leads me to what words -- what are the\nmagic words that you want the prosecution not to be able\nto use. Frightening is one magic word. Right? Dangerous\nis another magic word.\nMR. BRUCK: It most certainly is.\nQUESTION: Okay. I mean, we can just have a\nlist of magic words that prosecutors shouldn't use from\nnow on.\nMR. BRUCK: I think there would be no harm,\nalthough this case provides absolutely no occasion to\nconsider the issue, in dispensing with the future\ndangerousness requirement for precisely that reason, that\nwhen -- that it is -- there are so few cases in which the\njury is not likely, in the privacy of the jury room, to\nask the question, what if he gets out and does it again?\nThis comes up in case after case. And there's a -- in\nweighing the -- the State -- I mean, is there a danger\nthat the Simmons rule might then be applied in cases where\nit truly does not rebut something that the jury --\noccasionally in the rare case, yes.\nBut in considering the equities, I think it's\nworth keeping in mind that there is unfairness not only on\nthe issue of future dangerousness from this situation.\nThere is also unfairness in the retributive function that\nthe jury must suffer, and this is not in this case. It\nmay be more of an Eighth Amendment claim, but I think in\nweighing the risk of unfairness to the two sides, it's\nworth keeping in mind that life without parole is a much\nmore severe punishment. It is much more retributive than\nis life with parole. And it is -- it is more severe from\nthe moment it is imposed, not only 30 or 40 years hence.\nAnd the reason is that life without parole means life\nwithout hope.\nAnd anyone -- I -- I try these cases and -- and\nnegotiate plea bargains in these cases at the trial level,\nand I can tell you that there is nothing that cuts the ice\nfaster with the victim's family, with the prosecutor in\nsettling a case than life without parole not because of\nthe dangerousness, but because of its retributive effect.\nAnd there's something terribly unfair at -- when everyone\nin the courtroom knows how crushing this penalty is, this\npenalty of life without hope, except the jury, and they\nare left to think that their option is to let this man\nhope that some day he'll be out raising a family and\nworking at a job and -- and pretending to be a respectable\nmember of the community when it isn't so.\nQUESTION: You're asking us to overrule Simmons.\nMR. BRUCK: No, by no means. This case -- all I\nam saying is that if it is true, as my friend claims, that\nour category of cases in these non-weighing jurisdictions,\nwhere the jury is given free rein to consider everything,\nthat our category of non-dangerousness cases is actually\nso small as to be nonexistent, then in those States at\nleast I think it would be fair. And there is no harm in\nsaying --\nQUESTION: But that isn't the question you\npresented in your petition. All you presented in your\npetition was, was the ruling of the Supreme Court of South\nCarolina in this case contrary to Simmons?\nMR. BRUCK: Well, that's right because I\nrepresent a client and all my client requires is that\nSimmons be applied. We have something that I think can\nfairly be described as something approaching defiance of\nyour -- of your decision in Simmons when a record like\nthis is -- is found not to raise future dangerousness.\nThe only thing that State can come up with that they\ndidn't do is to call Dr. Grigson, some psychiatrist, to\nsay --\nQUESTION: Well, for the reasons that we've\nindicated in our questions, I -- I don't think it's\ndefiance. I -- I do think the prosecution is being pretty\ncareful not to raise future dangerous explicitly because\nit doesn't want the jury to know this.\nMR. BRUCK: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it makes it a little troublesome\nBut given the state of our law, future\ndangerousness has to be put in issue, and as we -- as\nwe've indicated, I -- I think under -- under your rule\nthat would be an issue in almost every case.\nLet me ask you this. You've heard me ask it\nhere before. I -- I take it that if this instruction were\ngiven, either the trial judge relented or future\ndangerousness was at issue, it's perfectly open to the\nState to say, now -- now, you may think this prisoner has\nno hope, but the legislature can change this tomorrow\nmorning. Tomorrow morning the legislature can change the\nparole rule, and this prisoner -- this defendant can be\nout in the community, once again a danger.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, I think that --\nQUESTION: I take it that would be a fair\nargument?\nMR. BRUCK: I don't think it would be for a\nseparate reason, which is it invites the -- the jury to\ntreat the law under which this person is being sentenced\nas in effect nonexistent. The only thing that's real is\ndeath because that can't be changed.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but the certainty that\nlife without parole will confine him indefinitely is much\nless than that execution will kill him.\nMR. BRUCK: That's true. That's true. But when\n-- when a court -- I mean, a jury doesn't need to be told\nthat all manmade law is subject to being changed by man.\nThat is something that we all know. Jurors know that,\nthat this law was enacted by the legislature and can be\nchanged --\nQUESTION: Well, would you allow the prosecutor\nto argue it if you were the trial judge?\nMR. BRUCK: No, I would not because to invite\nthe jury to --\nQUESTION: So, you're saying that the jury\ndoesn't need to be told what it already knows, but that's\ninconsistent with your whole position.\nMR. BRUCK: No. All I'm -- all I'm saying is\nthat the jury should not be invited to speculate that all\nthe law that it is being told to apply will melt away and\ncannot be relied on and thus should be ignored. And then\nthe jury ceases really to become a jury that applies the\nlaw of the State and becomes just a pack of --\nQUESTION: I thought your position -- I thought\nyour position was that this -- that the judge or the\nlawyer reads the text of what it says in the South\nCarolina law.\nMR. BRUCK: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Reads word for word what the\nlegislature enacted.\nMR. BRUCK: That is exactly correct.\nQUESTION: And that's all you're asking.\nMR. BRUCK: That's all we're asking. And, you\nknow, my -- my submission --\nQUESTION: Wait. Whether -- whether we should\nallow that to happen depends on, you know, how fair it is\nto the prosecution and why shouldn't the prosecution be\nable to point out the reality that that's what the\nlegislature has said today and it can change that\ntomorrow? So, if you really want future dangerousness to\nbe -- to be treated openly and honestly, I don't see how\nyou can just -- just say put in the one side and not the\nother.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, I have to say my case does not\nturn on the answer to that question. That could be\ndecided either way, as this case is reversed, because\nthat's not an issue in this case. It certainly would\nbecome the stuff of future appeals to this Court from the\nonly two States that see any issue left here, Pennsylvania\nand South Carolina.\nQUESTION: In all the other States, in -- in\nevery other State that has capital punishment --\nMR. BRUCK: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- this instruction is given as a\nmatter of course?\nMR. BRUCK: Regardless of any absence or\npresence or alleged absence of future dangerousness. In\nother words, every State but South Carolina and\nPennsylvania already go beyond Simmons, and these are the\nonly two outliers in which the record is combed for\nwhether or not future dangerousness is at issue.\nNow, as I say --\nQUESTION: When you say it's outliers, but once\nagain that's the -- that's the dichotomy that this Court\nset forth in -- in Simmons and in our past opinions.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, yes. The -- it's true that --\nthat Simmons set a constitutional minimum rule and it\nrequired future dangerousness to be at issue. And there\nare a great many -- in a -- in a non-weighing\njurisdiction, there are a great many ways of putting\nfuture dangerousness at issue. It can be done, as the\nCourt has held in Simmons itself, by argument. It can be\ndone, as is never done in South Carolina, by instruction\nto the Court, because it's not a statutory factor. Or it\ncan -- as the State agrees and as the South Carolina\nSupreme Court acknowledges, it can be done solely by\nevidence without argument by the solicitor.\nQUESTION: But what about the argument that\neverything that goes to future dangerousness also goes to\nsomething else? The prosecutor said, yes, I showed that\nthis was a terrible person because he had no prior record,\nand I used the Billy the Kid remark because -- to rebut\nthe age. So, I can give you a reason, other than future\ndangerousness, for everything that I put in.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, it's -- it's -- there's very\nlittle evidence of future dangerousness and very little\nargument that cannot also be given a retributive\ninterpretation, which is what the State has labored to do\nin their brief.\nAnd if all that -- it's striking that the State\nis not at all satisfied with the test stated by the South\nCarolina Supreme Court, which is whether the issue was\nargued or whether future dangerousness is a logical\ninference from the evidence. The State's test for whether\nevidence is -- raises an issue of future dangerousness is\nthat the evidence must only raise future dangerousness and\nmust raise nothing but future dangerousness.\nNow, it's rather hard. The only example, as I\nsay, they can think of is a psychiatric opinion that the\nman will kill again. Apparently that's the only evidence\nthat triggers Simmons under the Attorney General's view.\nQUESTION: So what? What's so -- what's so\nabsurd about that?\nMR. BRUCK: Because it ain't so.\nQUESTION: What is so absurd about that? If\nSimmons meant anything, it seems to me that's what Simmons\nmeant, or otherwise it -- it -- you know, it's virtually\nworthless.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, there was no psychiatric\nopinion introduced by the State in Simmons itself. There\nwas nothing but a metaphorical argument that two members\nof the Court didn't think raised future dangerousness at\nall.\nBut it was this idea of self-defense in response\nto someone who was a threat. That -- that was also an\nargument about retribution, and as the dissenting opinion\nin -- in Simmons pointed out, that -- you could certainly\nsee the retributive meaning, significance, that the\nprosecutor meant there.\nBut it also -- it also raised the issue of\nfuture dangerousness, and that was all in Simmons. And\nthat was enough. And that's why I say that to affirm this\ncase would require -- would require reversing Simmons.\nOne has to weigh, too -- I mean, you know, the\nState argues this issue as if we are keeping them from\nintroducing evidence, and we are doing something unfair or\nwe're saying they can't do this, they can't do that. We\ndon't say the State can't do anything. All we say is that\nwhen they make an argument like they made in this case --\nhe's quick-witted, doesn't that make someone a little more\ndangerous, calling the defendant Billy the Kid, Bloody\nBilly, the Butcher of Batesburg, and on and on and on and\non and on -- that we be able to answer it by saying how\nthe legislature has defined life imprisonment for the\npeople of South Carolina.\nThese jurors are the same voters that demanded\nthat life imprisonment be -- be enacted, and now that it\nhas been enacted, what can be fair about keeping the\ndefendant from telling the jury, even if all this that the\nprosecutor says about me is true, I will never be released\nagain?\nNow, the -- the State also acknowledges, both\nthe State Supreme Court and the Attorney General, that\nfuture dangerousness was raised in this case. They make\nno bones about that. But they say, well, we raised it in\na special way that does not implicate Simmons. What we\ndid was we introduced evidence that not even the Lexington\nCounty jail could keep this man from being nonviolent, and\nthat is future dangerousness. And that's why the\ninstruction that we offered, telling the jury that future\ndangerousness was not in the case, was denied.\nBut the -- but the State says, in defiance of\nall common sense, that evidence that this young man would\nbe dangerous, even behind bars and concrete and steel, did\nnot implicate the notion that if you notion that if you\nlet him out, he would be even more dangerous. That is why\nthe State says that prison dangerousness does not --\nQUESTION: He just didn't like being confined.\nMR. BRUCK: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Maybe he just didn't like being\nconfined. I mean, you can imagine a situation like that.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, anything is\npossible, but that does not commend itself to our common\nsense. I think what the jury is much more likely to infer\nfrom that is that if even jail and prison can't keep this\nguy from being dangerous, if he ever gets let out, let out\non parole, Katie, bar the door. He's going to be a\ndisaster.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that\ninference. If I were a juror and I heard about this\nevidence, I'd say my principal focus would be on the\nsafety of the guards and the inmates. I'd say this man is\ndangerous in prison and that's the reason for capital\npunishment. It seems to me perfectly logical.\nMR. BRUCK: That -- as I say, the -- the\nevidence has two meanings and that is one of them. We\ndon't quarrel with that. But at the same time, if -- if\nhe is --\nQUESTION: Well, then you can't say it defies\nall logic, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me that\nthat's the -- the most direct conclusion that -- that\nshould follow from the prosecution's evidence on this\npoint. He's dangerous in prison.\nMR. BRUCK: Even if it is the most direct, how\ncan we say that it does not also prove that if you let him\nout on parole, he'll be even more dangerous?\nQUESTION: But that isn't what Simmons said. I\nthought the rule of Simmons was -- was a rule of fairness.\nLook, prosecution, if you're going to argue that this man\nshould be executed because it -- he will be dangerous to\nsociety if he's -- if he's let out, then, for Pete's sake,\nyou have to let the jury know that he won't be let out.\nIt's an unfair argument for the prosecution to say he'll\nbe dangerous to society unless you execute him, when the\nprosecution knows that he'll never get out.\nMR. BRUCK: Right.\nQUESTION: But this is far beyond that. This\nhas nothing to do with such an unfair argument by the\nprosecution. He's not saying don't let this person go\nbecause he'll be praying on society. There's -- there's\nnothing approaching that argument.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, I think it -- it -- what we\nhave here is a prosecutor who has Simmons and who knows\nthat if he wants to hide from the jury -- you see, the\nprosecution agrees with us about -- and this is, in a way,\nwhat is most disturbing and troubling about this case. If\nthe prosecution did not believe, based on their evidence\nand their argument, that this jury was thinking about\nfuture dangerousness to society, why would they care?\nWhat possible harm could there be from a Simmons\ninstruction?\nI think the prosecution entirely agrees with us\non the importance of this and on the dynamics of jury\ndeliberation in a case where a -- where the -- where the\nState's evidence and the argument is of this nature. They\nknow perfectly well what any practicing lawyer who tries\nthese cases on either side knows, which is that this jury\ngoes back in the jury room, after having seen and heard\nall of this, and thinks one thing for sure: We got to\nmake sure he doesn't do it again. And it is a\nconstitutional fact, established by the Simmons case,\nthat's -- that part of that is parole, the jury's\nmisconception about parole, because we've had parole for\nso many generations and life without parole is a new\nphenomenon in this country.\nQUESTION: But this -- this is not a case, is\nit, in -- where the trial judge put any limitation on the\ndefense attorney's arguing this point or where the jury\ncame back with a question. This is not one of those\ncases.\nMR. BRUCK: Right. For all we know, the jury\nknew there was parole, wrongly. And no limitation.\nBut I have to say -- and the State has not\nclaimed that in the face of this argument on instructions,\nthat the lawyer -- the defense attorney should have picked\nup a statute book and read to the jury the instruction\nthat the judge had just refused to give. She would have\nhad her head handed to her on a plate if she had done\nthat. That is not permitted in South Carolina. When a\nlegal principle has been ruled out of a case, a lawyer\ncannot then attempt to charge the jury anyway. And that\nis not an argument you'll find in the State's case.\nThey do say that her -- her rhetorical claim or\n-- or co-counsel's claim that you'll never see the light\nof day should be deemed as the equivalent of a no-parole\ninstruction, but you dealt with that and disposed of that\nargument in Shafer, where a much more explicit argument\nwas held not to be the equivalent of an instruction on --\non State law concerning parole. So, I think that -- that\nargument has absolutely nothing to commend it and is -- is\ndirectly controlled, I would submit, by -- by Shafer.\nQUESTION: But Shafer was explicit that counsel\nwould not be allowed to read the statute, which is what I\nthink counsel wanted to do.\nMR. BRUCK: Well, that's right. But you know,\nit -- a lawyer doesn't, under South Carolina practice,\nneed to ask the court whether an instruction that has been\nruled out of the case -- whether it's okay for her to read\nit to the jury. We know that that is not permissible.\nI should add, too, that -- that the trial judge\ninstructed the jury in this case that he is the sole\ninstructor on the facts. At page 618 of the record, he\nsaid, as -- I am as judge the sole -- made the sole and\nonly instructor in the law. And so -- and that's, you\nknow, how trials in South Carolina are conducted. Lawyers\ndo not instruct.\nI realize as a matter of constitutional law, if\nit were -- if there were a way for defense counsel to have\ndone that, despite the -- the court's ruling, it would\nhave sufficed under Simmons, but there was no such way,\nand that's why the State makes no such argument in their\n-- in their brief. This is not where an opportunity was\npassed up by defense counsel to instruct on the law. This\n-- there wasn't any such -- any such opportunity, and\nthat's why the -- the argument is so vague and so\nunsatisfactory under -- under Shafer v. -- v. South\nCarolina.\nIf this is enough to get around Simmons and to\nallow prosecutors to keep juries from knowing what the\nSouth Carolina legislature has done with respect to the\nabolition of parole, then you will see, as you already are\nseeing, case after case from South Carolina in which the\nenvelope is constantly being pushed further and further\nback in what, I have to submit, is a somewhat manipulative\neffort to get the advantage of the jury's misconceptions,\nto get the advantage of the false dilemma that Simmons\ncorrectly identified in order to get more death sentences\nthan are actually merited by the law and the evidence in\neach case.\nAs I say, this is the second time that -- that\nSouth Carolina has -- South Carolina's compliance with\nSimmons has been before this Court in this calendar year.\nThere probably won't be another one this calendar year,\nbut there will be a continuing procession. And, indeed,\nthe first case in line will be Shafer v. South Carolina,\nwhich was remanded for reconsideration of the -- for\nconsideration -- for a ruling on the issue of future\ndangerousness. If --\nQUESTION: Well, perhaps -- you suggested in\nyour brief that for the future the South Carolina\nlegislature is going to require that the jury be informed.\nMR. BRUCK: Prospectively, yes. It will -- it\nwill do no good for -- for people like Shafer and -- and\nthe petitioner in this case whose cases have already been\ntried. But, yes, the House of Representatives has already\nvoted overwhelmingly to, in effect, require a Simmons\ninstruction in every case. That bill is now before the\nSenate and it could be by this time next year, this will\nbe of only historical interest in South Carolina, except\nto the petitioner --\nQUESTION: May I ask, as a matter of historical\ninterest, when did the requirement that the -- I mean,\nwhen did -- when did the sentence of life without parole\nfirst authorized by the South Carolina --\nMR. BRUCK: The very first time came in -- in\n1986.\nQUESTION: 1986.\nMR. BRUCK: And thereafter, the South Carolina\nSupreme Court first handed down a truth-in-sentencing rule\nand then reversed itself just before Simmons, and Simmons\nwas the first case tried under the new regime.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bruck.\nMr. Waters, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF S. CREIGHTON WATERS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WATERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Simmons v. South Carolina, a limited due\nprocess exception was crafted to the general rule in\nCalifornia v. Ramos that it was for the States to decide\nwhether to inform the juries on matters of parole or other\nearly release. And the issue in this case is what\nargument and evidentiary submissions are sufficient to --\nfor the prosecution to have been deemed to raise future\ndangerousness such that due process overcomes that State\nlaw rule.\nAnd petitioner in this case contends that future\ndangerousness can be raised simply by the gruesome facts\nof the crime, by misbehavior in jail, by a prior criminal\nrecord. And, of course, that would create, as has already\nbeen discussed, a virtually standardless test and would\nconflict with this Court's statements of the Simmons rule,\nas well as the subsequent interpretation of the rule by\nmany other courts. And that is, of course, that a\nprosecutor must specifically rely on future dangerousness\nto society as a basis for death.\nAnd, of course, that -- the reason for that is\nthe rationale of Simmons itself, which is a due process\nright of rebuttal. Future dangerousness -- a future\ndangerousness requirement is necessary to that due process\nright of rebuttal, and obviously, in order to have the\nright to rebut something, the other party must have first\ndone something to affirmatively raise that issue.\nNow, admittedly some --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waters, in -- in your view has\nany South Carolina prosecutor since Simmons used words\nthat would invoke that case?\nMR. WATERS: Invoke Simmons itself?\nQUESTION: Yes. It seems to me that any\nprosecutor, if your argument is right, can easily get\naround Simmons simply by not using the words future\ndangerousness and saying, well, this is relevant to\nsomething else.\nMR. WATERS: Well, I think, you know, our State\nSupreme Court has on two occasions ruled that Simmons was\nviolated, and in that case, the -- the prosecutor argued\nthat, you know, he's shown that he cannot live inside or\noutside of prison. So, clearly that crosses the line.\nI think, you know, the -- the fundamental --\nQUESTION: I thought your position was if he\ncouldn't live in prison, then Simmons was out.\nMR. WATERS: Well, in that particular case, he\nsaid both outside of society and inside prison in that\nparticular case. That's State v. Timothy Rogers, a State\ncourt case. So, our court has on -- on a couple of\noccasions ruled that. I mean, obviously --\nQUESTION: You -- you then concede that if the\n-- if the argument that counsel for the -- the prosecutor\nmakes is this man is dangerous in or out of prison, in\nthat case a Simmons instruction is warranted.\nMR. WATERS: I think that by incorporating the\noutside society aspect of the argument, our State Supreme\nCourt has already ruled that and I'm not here to -- to\nchallenge that.\nQUESTION: I understood Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion -- and I'm interested in it too -- as can you\ntell us, as a matter of practice, are there instances in\nwhere the Simmons rule is followed in South Carolina and\nthe jury is instructed about parole because of future\ndangerous being an issue, or as Justice Ginsburg\nsuggested, is it the common pattern and practice for\nprosecution -- for the prosecutor to stay away from this?\nMR. WATERS: No. There are plenty of instances\nwhere -- where solicitors argue future dangerousness to\nsociety, and a life without parole instruction is given.\nThere -- it -- it ultimately boils down to what the\nprosecutor does in his argument and how the trial judge\nrules on -- on what was raised in -- in that trial. But\nit does happen.\nQUESTION: Don't you have that here? I mean,\nthe argument here was not only the -- the Bloody Billy,\nthe Butcher of whatever it was, but the words dangerous\nwere used I think -- I think twice to describe him in the\nargument, once at least. And -- and the argument included\nthe -- the statement to the jurors, I hope you never have\nto be in the position again of being 30 -- 30 feet away\nfrom this kind of -- of a killer. Well, the jurors aren't\ngoing to be spending time in prison, and I -- I don't know\nwhy that argument means anything other than I hope this\nguy is not going to be out where you are going to be and\nfind you as close to him again. So, hasn't -- hasn't he\nraised it even on -- on your criteria?\nMR. WATERS: I don't believe so in this case. I\nthink if you focus on the prosecutor's argument as a\nwhole, it's clear that the majority of his argument was\nretributive. And we would assert --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not talking about -- I\nmean, you -- the majority of the argument isn't even the\ncriterion that you are arguing for. You said, look, he's\ngot to raise it on my theory. He's got to raise it as an\nargument that this person will be dangerous on the\noutside. And I assume if he does that once, that's\nsufficient on your theory. And my question is, didn't --\neven on your theory, didn't he do it here?\nMR. WATERS: Well, with regard to the dangerous\ncomment, what the solicitor said in that particular case\nwas -- he said, well, the evidence here is that he's\nquick-witted, he's not retarded. And of course, the\nevidence in this case also was that petitioner was a close\nfriend of -- or the petitioner's family was a close friend\nof this victim. He used to work with the victim, and that\nhe used that familiarity with the victim to make her more\nvulnerable.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what about the 30 feet?\nI hope you're never in this position again. What about\nthat argument? I mean, isn't that an argument that makes\nno sense except on the assumption that this person might\n-- the defendant might be outside?\nMR. WATERS: That -- that particular argument\nwas -- was made at -- at the beginning of the sentencing\nphase in opening statement. It was a brief reference. I\ndon't think that that --\nQUESTION: I mean, it was made to the jurors.\nThey heard it, didn't they?\nMR. WATERS: They did hear that, but I think if\nyou read it in context, it was more of the case of you\njust committed -- convicted this guy of a horrible crime.\nYou have a tough job ahead of you, and I hope you never\nhave to do this again. I -- I think that -- that brief,\nisolated passage, when read in the context of what the\nsolicitor was saying there, would not have such -- been\nsuch as to necessarily flag the future dangerousness issue\nin the mind.\nQUESTION: So, if -- if the prosecutor had\nclosed his argument with that, that would have sufficed.\nMR. WATERS: I'm not -- I don't know if I would\nsay that much. I just point out that it was very early\nand it was just a brief reference in opening statement,\nand I don't think that that -- that can be pointed to as\nto have crossed that line because I don't really think he\nused it for that inference, that you know, this -- you\nknow, this guy is going to be dangerous to you. He was\nmore saying, you know, you just convicted this guy of the\nmost horrible, bloodiest crime you can imagine, and he's a\nhorrible person, and now you've got one more tough job to\ndo. And I hope you never have to go through this again.\nI think that was the point of his argument, not that this\nguy --\nQUESTION: He didn't -- my -- my -- you correct\nme if I'm wrong, because I don't have the transcript in\nfront of me, but my recollection is he didn't say, I hope\nyou don't have to go through this again. He said, I hope\nyou're -- you know, you're not in this position of being\n30 feet away from this kind of a person again, which is I\nthink quite different.\nMR. WATERS: Well, he -- he did not say, I hope\nyou don't have to go through that, but I think if you read\nhis argument, that was the point of it, and I think in\ncontext, that's the obvious point of it rather than future\ndangerousness.\nQUESTION: May I ask this? You gave us a couple\nof examples of the South Carolina Supreme Court itself\nsetting aside the conviction -- or executions because they\nhad failed to give the instruction. And you -- you've\njust quoted the example he mentioned both inside and\noutside prison.\nNow, did they consider the -- your argument that\nif read in the context of the entire argument, it -- it\nwas a featured part of the argument, or did they -- could\nthe -- could one reasonably think that from those\nopinions, just that mere mention was enough?\nMR. WATERS: In that -- in that particular case,\nthe solicitor focused much of his argument on that. He\nsaid, this -- this defendant has shown by his prior\nrecord, because the defendant had had prior incarcerations\nand prior releases -- he's shown by his prior record that\nhe cannot exist safely both inside prison and outside\nsociety. So, I would concede that crosses the line. I\nthink it was focused on in that case, and it was a direct\nstatement of outside society.\nAnd I -- I don't want to get into magic words,\nbut I think when you say outside society, when he clearly\nfocuses, that -- that would be a magic word triggering\nSimmons.\nQUESTION: But you would draw a line depending\nin part on how much the issue was emphasized in the\nargument. Not just an isolated comment, for example,\nwould not be enough.\nMR. WATERS: What I'm saying is that if there's\nan isolated comment in the context of an -- of an argument\nthat focuses on retribution, that -- it's kind of a\nDonnelly v. DeChristoforo principle, that you shouldn't\nassume that the prosecutor intended to worst meaning from\nthat, and you shouldn't assume that the jury necessarily\ntook the worst meaning from that. And -- and so, I'm not\nsaying -- I'm just saying that the context does matter,\nand -- and that's essentially what we have here.\nIn Simmons, you know, we had a -- the more\negregious situation. We had the prosecutor say, jury, you\nknow, the death penalty is going to be society's response\nto a threat, society's response. The prosecutor said,\njury, you know, this will be your act of self-defense to\nthis particular defendant. The death penalty will be an\nact of self-defense. The prosecutor even went on -- so\nfar as to say his own expert calls him dangerous and had\nbrought that out in cross examination. There's none of\nthat here. All they can do in this case is -- is go\nthrough a technical parsing of the argument.\nQUESTION: Well, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't\nit be? Why isn't it fundamentally unfair in every capital\ncase, after all, not to give the instruction that the\nalternative is life without parole? After all, you have a\njury who knows it has a murderer in front of it. It's\ntrying to decide among all alternative punishments. Death\nis the worst, and then the State won't tell them what the\nalternative is. Apparently every State but two have\ndecided that is unfair. And why, to go back to basics,\nisn't it as unfair a thing just about as one can imagine\nto tell the jury you have to give life or something else\nand then not tell them what the something else is,\nparticularly when they're likely to think he'll be out\nafter a few years?\nMR. WATERS: Well, I think the jury in this case\n-- you know, they are told life imprisonment, and they're\nnever told that there's any possibility of --\nQUESTION: But sitting -- in your experience,\nwouldn't you say most jurors are sitting there thinking\nthat life doesn't mean life?\nMR. WATERS: Well, I -- I'm not sure that that's\nnecessarily true. I mean, in State v. Patterson, which\nwas a 1986 case in South Carolina, there was a voir dire\nof the jury on that, and most of the jurors said, we\nthought it meant, you know, he'll never get out. So, I\nmean, there's conflicting evidence on that. I know this\nCourt has repeatedly referred to the fact that it -- it is\nnew event and many jurors may not know, but I don't know\nif that's necessarily the case.\nAs a matter of fundamental fairness, we're\nstill talking about, to some degree, deference to the\nStates. And -- and so --\nQUESTION: What does deference to the State got\nto do with fundamental fairness? It seems to me that's an\nentirely different argument.\nThe fundamental fairness question that Justice\nBreyer is raising is in a context in which it may or may\nnot be debated as to whether jurors know instinctively\nthat life really means life, doesn't fundamental fairness\nrequire that they be instructed unequivocally so that they\nknow the terms within which they must act in coming to a\nverdict. That's the fundamental fairness question.\nMR. WATERS: Well, I think that the -- the\nineligibility of parole, as this Court held in Simmons, is\nonly directly relevant to future dangerousness to society\nargument, and that, of course, was the due process\nrationale followed in Simmons.\nAs far as whether under an Eighth Amendment\ncontext or even under a due process that life without\nparole is an effective rebuttal to retribution arguments\nand that sort of thing, that's not presented by this case.\nBut I -- I think that the -- the relevance, again, of --\nof ineligibility for parole is to rebut future\ndangerousness to society. That's what --\nQUESTION: Well, in -- in Simmons, there's no\nquestion that the future dangerousness issue, together\nwith the jury's question and so on, presented an egregious\ncase of -- of a need for instruction.\nMR. WATERS: Yes.\nQUESTION: But let's -- let's assume -- and I\ndon't believe this is this case, even remotely, but let's\nassume we had a case in which somehow future dangerousness\nwere not an issue. And let's assume we -- we had a -- a\nstraight retribution case. Given the fact that there is\nenough history to put in -- in doubt, to put into question\nwhat really is meant by life imprisonment, in the absence\nof a further instruction, why doesn't fundamental fairness\nrequire that the jury know for sure what the terms mean,\nwhich it must select from in sentencing this person?\nMR. WATERS: Well, again, the jury is told we're\ndealing with death or life imprisonment.\nQUESTION: No, but that simply begs the\nquestion. That -- that is changing my question to you.\nMy question to you says we're operating in a context in\nwhich historical practice leads one to -- to question\nwhether jurors really do understand that life means life\nin this case in this State now. On that assumption, why\ndoesn't fundamental fairness require that the juries be\ngiven a clear instruction so that they're not sitting\nthere wondering what it means if they come back with a\nlife sentence?\nMR. WATERS: I think that that depends that --\nthat be all to end all is the without parole context of\nlife. I mean, life is still a very severe penalty, and --\nand in order to get to your point, I think that you have\nto assume that adding without parole to it makes it so\nfar --\nQUESTION: You bet I assume that. There is a\nbig difference between life imprisonment, in which a\nperson never walks out of the prison, and life\nimprisonment in which the person walks out 15 years later.\nYes, I make that assumption and I want you to make that\nassumption in answering my question. Why doesn't\nfundamental fairness require that the juries understand\nthat?\nMR. WATERS: Well, again, I would have to fall\nback to the fact of is the only aspect of the State's case\nthat it rebuts is future dangerousness to society. And --\nand so that --\nQUESTION: And my question to you is let's\nassume a case in which that is not the issue, a case in\nwhich we're talking about retribution. I want to narrow\nthe issue down here. Why doesn't fundamental fairness\nrequire that the jurors understand what the words mean?\nMR. WATERS: Because if it is a purely\nretributive case and -- and future dangerousness was not\nan issue, then there is nothing fundamentally unfair. The\nState has not made any arguments that the defendant did\nnot have an opportunity to rebut. And -- and that's the\nholding of Simmons.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the -- the argument to the\ncontrary would be if you were sitting there thinking that\nthis terrible murderer is in front of you and you are\nasked what is the appropriate punishment, and on the one\nhand you were told it's death, and on the other hand you\nwere told -- well, you're not told because a person who\nwants to retribute, wants vengeance, would surely like to\nknow that the alternative to death, which is surely\nvengeance, is life in prison forever, not just life in\nprison for 10 or 15 years. I mean, can you think -- in a\ndeath case punishment stage, surely that would be on\nanyone's list of top five of the relevant factors.\nMR. WATERS: I don't know if you can necessarily\nassume that's the case when the jury hears evidence and\nthey're instructed on what to consider and the focus of\nthe evidence is his adaptability in prison, which is the\ncase in this case and many other cases.\nAnd I think with regard to life without parole\nbeing a response to purely retributive arguments, it's not\nsuch an obvious be all and end all response to -- to\nretribution that due process steps in, as opposed to the\nsituation in Simmons where future dangerousness to society\ndoes respond to that. I think that there is still a\ndistinction there that -- that retribution is not\nnecessarily directly responded to by a life without parole\nsentence, and so --\nQUESTION: I assume that the reason for these\nrules were just -- just State principles that the law says\nwhat it says, and we don't want to get into the\nrefinements of -- of how long a life sentence may be. In\nthose States that do allow the fact that a life sentence\ndoes mean a life sentence to be introduced, do those\njurisdictions also permit or do other jurisdictions permit\nthe prosecution to show that a life sentence does not mean\na life sentence?\nMR. WATERS: There -- there are a number of --\nof jurisdictions that have wrestled with that. I think\nCalifornia v. Ramos is an example of that. Illinois has\nhad -- has wrestled with that. So, some do allow charges\non the possibility of commutation, on the possibility of\npardon, on the possibility of change in the law and -- and\nadd argument on that as well.\nAnd, of course, South Carolina's policy has\nalways been that we want a simple either/or choice, death\nor life, and -- and we don't want to bring in these\ncollateral concerns. Now, whether the members of this\nCourt disagree with that as a matter of policy, this\nCourt, of course, has stated in many contexts that, you\nknow, the -- the wisdom of policy decisions, as long as\nthey have a certain modicum of -- of reasonableness, are\nfor the States.\nQUESTION: Is the prosecution allowed to argue\nin South Carolina when -- when the choice is -- is life or\ndeath, is the prosecution allowed to argue the possibility\nof commutation?\nMR. WATERS: No, no. Parole and early release\nis off-limits on both sides of the coin, and there's never\nbeen a State case yet to rule that, well, to be fair, the\nprosecution needs to have that, at least as --\nQUESTION: Well, that's not really very fair, is\nit? When -- when the jury, you know -- if you instruct\nthe jury that life means life, it really doesn't mean\nlife. You'd have to let the prosecution come in and say\nit could be commuted.\nMR. WATERS: Absolutely, absolutely, and I would\nagree with that.\nQUESTION: Or the -- all the law can be changed?\nMR. WATERS: Or it could be changed.\nQUESTION: The South Carolina Supreme Court\nhasn't dealt with that issue, though, has it? Because --\nbecause Simmons is relatively new. Has there been a case\nwhere the prosecutor says, okay, judge, I said future\ndangerousness, but I want to tell them that the law can\nchange, that there's a pardon, that there's a clemency\npower? That hasn't come up, has it?\nMR. WATERS: Not of which I'm aware. In fact,\nthis rule developed initially when there was parole\neligibility, and it was really a rule initially created to\n-- to benefit defendants, frankly, in -- in that they\ndidn't want the jury to know -- the defense didn't want\nthe jury to know that there was parole eligibility. So,\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court said, okay, we're going\nto charge life. Life means life imprisonment. That's\nwhat it means.\nQUESTION: Well, then the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt itself changed its rule on that?\nMR. WATERS: It had. There was a period of time\nwhere their -- they did sanction charging on parole\neligibility. This was prior to life without parole on --\non either 20- or 30-year parole eligibility, depending on\nthe jury's finding of aggravators. That existed, I\nbelieve, for about 4 years, and was overturned in 1991 I\nthink. So, there was a period of time.\nBut the policy -- the rule has always stayed the\nsame, though, and that is that we don't want the jury to\nbe legislating a plan of punishment. We don't want to be\n-- them to be concerned about these possible future\nevents. We want them to make an either/or choice.\nAnd South Carolina will remain true to Simmons,\nbut beyond that, unless the policy is considered to be so\nunreasonable as to not pass the laugh test, then I think\nthat they can potentially -- they can have that policy.\nAnd I want to bring up another point, especially\nwith regard to this and -- and what the prosecution did in\nthis case. I don't think the -- the Court should -- or I\ndon't -- I don't think it would be wise to -- to assume\nthat prosecutors are going to be dishonest or to assume\nthat the State court is going to be dishonest and is going\nto circumvent this rule.\nAnd in fact, what the prosecution was doing in\nthis case, yes, he was trying to avoid Simmons, but he was\ndoing that to obey the law. And -- and clearly in -- in\nJustice O'Connor's concurrence, it said that if the\nprosecution does not argue future dangerousness, then the\ncharge does not have to be given, and -- and that's what\nthe prosecutor was doing here. So, he wasn't trying to\ncircumvent the law. He wasn't trying to be sneaky. He\nwas trying to obey the law, and -- and --\nQUESTION: Yes, but he was trying to get the --\nprevent the jury from getting this information.\nMR. WATERS: That's true. That's true. He made\na tactical decision that he -- and I don't know if it's\nnecessarily tactical -- he was not going to rely on future\ndangerousness, and since that would not trigger Simmons,\nthen the State law rule would apply. And that's --\nQUESTION: And -- and he also kind of snuck in\nthe word dangerousness there in the -- in the 30-foot\nexample, but they don't count because they weren't\nprominent in his argument.\nMR. WATERS: Well, I'd -- I'd like to -- to\naddress that specifically. At that point in the argument,\nhe was talking about the particular crime in this --\nQUESTION: What -- what passage are we -- are we\ntalking about a passage? I don't have it in my -- where\nthe -- the prosecutor expressly says future dangerous?\nMR. WATERS: No, not at all.\nQUESTION: I thought perhaps from his question\nthat's what we were talking about.\nMR. WATERS: What he -- what he was doing was he\nsaid, okay, this defendant is quick-witted. This\ndefendant -- the evidence says this defendant is not\nretarded. Now, doesn't that make him more dangerous for\nShirley Shealy, for this crime on this January the 5th,\nfor this particular lady? And what he was saying, if --\nif you read his argument in context, was again that the\npetitioner in this case was a close family friend of the\nvictim and also used to work at that very same Kentucky\nFried Chicken.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waters, it wasn't quite like\nthat. He said dangerousness, and then counsel for the\ndefense stopped him at that point, and then he came back\nwith, well, I meant dangerous for her.\nMR. WATERS: Well, I don't know if you can\nnecessarily read that that was at a protracted period. It\nmay have been he just cut off before he finished his\nsentence. But what he was trying to say was is that he\nwas more dangerous for her because she would have trusted\nhim. She would not have expect to be cut to ribbons by\nthis person because he was her friend. And that's what\nthe prosecution was saying. He was saying that makes this\ncrime more aggravated. It's more premeditated. It's more\ncallous. He preyed on the vulnerability of the victim.\nQUESTION: And she was outside prison when this\nhappened.\nMR. WATERS: She was outside prison, but this is\nretribution. This is, you know, jury, sentence this\ndefendant to death for all the bad things that he has done\nculminating in this capital crime. This was such a\nhorrible crime. And if you read the prosecution, there's\nat least five or six examples where he says, what's the\npunishment that fits the crime? It doesn't matter if he\ndoesn't have a prior record. This case is bad enough on\nits own. This is a case for the death penalty. And that\nwas a recurrent theme from the beginning, the middle, and\nthe end of his argument, from start to finish.\nSo, I would assert then that, you know, when\nread as a whole -- and -- and again, if you look at the\nevidence of dangerousness -- and there's been some raised\nof whether -- the issue raised of whether dangerousness\nwithin prison counts. And obviously, as a matter of\nlogic, it doesn't because, you know, whether or not the\ndefendant is going to get out of prison has nothing to do\nwith whether he will be a danger inside.\nBut more -- more --\nQUESTION: But if he is a danger inside, it\nfollows that he will be a danger outside if he gets out.\nIsn't that the kind of common sense inference that anyone\nwould draw?\nMR. WATERS: I -- I don't think the link is --\nis so readily made. I mean, it's common knowledge that --\nthat prison --\nQUESTION: Well, the -- the evidence of -- of\nhis dangerousness included things that he used to like to\ntorture small animals, psychiatric evidence to the effect\nthat he wants to -- to take action, homicidal action,\nagainst anybody who annoys him. The -- the word was a\nlittle bit more flamboyant in the psychiatrist's\ntestimony, but that was the point. These -- these don't\ngo to conditions that would only come into play inside of\na prison.\nMR. WATERS: Well, in that particular instance,\nnumber one, the prosecution never used any of that in his\nclosing argument. But I don't --\nQUESTION: Well, it brought out in its cross\nexamination.\nMR. WATERS: Absolutely.\nBut -- but number two, if you -- that there was\ntheir adaptability expert, and all of this went to focus\non what the jury had before it, which was adaptability to\nprison, and that's the issue that they were focused upon.\nAnd -- and what -- and the expert said, well, you know --\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's assume that. Let's\nassume that was the -- was the point. The fact is the\nevidence came out, and there's -- there's no common sense\nbasis that I can think of to say that this evidence would\nnot indicate that if the individual got out of prison, he\nwould be very dangerous to the people he came in contact\nwith. And I thought you were arguing that you couldn't\nmake such an inference.\nMR. WATERS: I think that that -- that evidence\nis very close, but I would -- I would assert that -- that\nthe way it was used in this particular case to respond to\nadaptability, which is dangerousness within prison, which\nwas the specific issue that was focused before this jury.\nIf the prosecution --\nQUESTION: But what started all of this, I\nthought, was -- was the point that you were making that\nthe evidence that went to dangerousness in prison did not\nground in inference of dangerousness outside. Maybe I\nmisunderstood your point.\nMR. WATERS: No. I -- I agree that that\nparticular -- those particular instances are a bit broader\nthan the majority of evidence of dangerousness within\nprison, but I think that the -- his expert said, look,\nhe's not a violent person. He hasn't had a violent past.\nHe -- he's -- he's not mentally ill. He's -- he's going\nto be great in prison. He's not the type of individual\nthat poses a risk in prison. He's not a predatorial,\ninstitutional violent individual, which their witnesses\nwere noting a distinction between society in prison and\nsociety outside of prison.\nAnd I think all the State was doing was cross\nexamining on that, saying, wait a minute. You're saying\nhe's going to be adaptable? Well, he says, you know, he\nhas violent fantasies. Well, that was brought out on\ndirect by the defense. They -- they brought that out, of\nthese violent fantasies, and the State was merely cross\nexamining on a point that already had been made by the\ndefense and saying, your opinion here is that he's\nadaptable. Well, what about this -- this violent fantasy?\nSo, it was only used in the context of -- even\nthough it -- I agree, it has a broader context -- a\nbroader -- you know, it wasn't just his misbehavior in\nprison, but it was only used by the State here to\nchallenge the adaptability prison in -- or the\nadaptability issue of -- of what he would do in -- within\nprison.\nQUESTION: And it is important to the State, I\nsuppose, to show that he will be dangerous in prison.\nMR. WATERS: Oh, absolutely. This is the --\nQUESTION: The jury presumably would not want to\ngive a life sentence to someone who's going to continue to\nkill in prison.\nMR. WATERS: Absolutely. And this is -- this,\nof course, is the state of -- of Skipper, and -- and it's\nan inevitability that -- that you're going to see an\nadaptability case. But --\nQUESTION: The argument is made whenever the\nState makes that point, that perfectly valid point, to the\njury. It automatically triggers Simmons.\nMR. WATERS: I'm sorry? The -- the point?\nQUESTION: The argument made is that when the\nState makes that perfectly valid point about dangerousness\nin prison, it automatically triggers Simmons. And you say\nit should not unless -- unless the prosecutor specifically\nargues violence, dangerousness outside of prison.\nMR. WATERS: Correct. As a matter of logic\nthat --\nQUESTION: But that really doesn't help you here\nbecause here you further had evidence of his escape risk.\nMR. WATERS: And --\nQUESTION: So that this wasn't a guy who was\njust going to sit quietly and -- and enjoy his time in\nprison. This is someone who presented an escape risk and\nhence raised a risk of -- of acting out his dangerous\npropensity if he succeeds in escaping.\nMR. WATERS: And I think that that's -- I would\nagree with that wholeheartedly. I think the majority of\nthe -- of the prosecution's dangerousness within prison\nevidence went to him being an escape risk, and -- but the\nfact of the matter is, is whether or not you buy there's a\ndistinction between -- or accept there's a distinction\nbetween inside prison and outside society, whether or not\n-- whatever you think about Simmons, the fact of the\nmatter is that ineligibility for parole does absolutely\nnothing to respond to the fact that he's an escape risk.\nHe's saying he's going to bust out. It -- the fact that\nhe can't get parole does nothing to respond that he's\ngoing to bust out -- that he might bust out of prison.\nQUESTION: So, you should have been happy with\nthe instruction is what that proves.\nMR. WATERS: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: You should have been happy with the\ninstruction.\nMR. WATERS: With the?\nQUESTION: Because you're concentrating on what\nwould happen in prison. So, the instruction wouldn't help\nyou -- it wouldn't hurt you. It would actually help you.\nMR. WATERS: What? The --\nQUESTION: This fellow is going to be kept where\nhe'll be the most dangerous. Therefore, you should kill\nhim. That's your argument.\nMR. WATERS: No. That's -- that's not\nnecessarily my argument. I think the argument, again,\ngoes to adaptability. I certainly -- certainly wouldn't\n-- wouldn't assert that.\nBut, you know, as far as to his contention that,\nwell, why does the State care, you know, about giving this\ncharge if they're saying they're not raising future\ndangerousness, again it raises these collateral concerns\ndown the road of pardon, which he's eligible for pardon.\nIt raises the -- the issues of change in the law, and --\nand the State seeks to avoid those. And so, that's why it\ncares. It doesn't want to have to get into that.\nAnd if that issue is given, I don't know if a\ntrial judge, without direction from the Supreme Court, the\nState Supreme Court, would allow a prosecutor to then\nrespond with -- with, you know, arguments about change in\nthe law. And -- and I guess, you know, depending on -- on\nwhat happens, we'll have to see guidance on that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waters, you didn't really mean --\nyour brief could be read to say that -- that the lawyer\nwas effectively allowed to tell the jury that life means\nlife. You said something in your -- the jury -- that\nbecause the line was about defendant would never see the\nlight of day.\nMR. WATERS: Right.\nQUESTION: It's no different than -- from what\nit was in Shafer in that respect.\nMR. WATERS: I -- I fully understand what Shafer\nheld, and my only point with that was, was that the\nreasons that -- that this Court relied upon in Shafer were\nnot present in this case, to why those were not\nsufficient, and that was, number one, the jury asked. So,\nobviously, it didn't work. And number two, that the judge\ntold the jury, well, parole eligibility is not for your\nconsideration, which raised the concern in Simmons that,\nwell, parole is available but for some --\nQUESTION: But you -- but you don't dispute that\nif the -- if the lawyer then -- if she had tried to say in\nopen court, now, jurors, I'm going to read you from the\nSouth Carolina, that she would have her head cut off by\nthe judge.\nMR. WATERS: I think it's very unlikely the\ntrial judge would have allowed her to do that.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd -- and we would just assert, though, that --\nthat this is a case -- there's no indication whatsoever\nthat the jury was confused or concerned with his possible\nrelease. They didn't ask the question. They weren't --\nit wasn't interjected by the trial judge. And so, all I'm\nsaying is -- is that makes this case materially different\nfrom what happened in Shafer when it said that that was\ninsufficient.\nAnd this -- this lawyer argued natural life in\nprison -- imprisonment extensively, said, you have two\nchoices, jury. You have death, a quick, painless death,\nor you have a long, slow death, and that a wife -- and he\nasserted earlier, that well, you know, the -- but the jury\nmight think he's going to get out of prison and have a\nwife and a car. Well, no. The defense argued in this\ncase just the opposite. They -- they argued that a wife\nis never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly. A car is\nnever ever going to happen for Billy Kelly, and -- and\nconcluded by saying, I think life imprisonment is the\nright punishment in this case because he'll never see the\ndaylight -- the light of daylight again. So, I think it\nwas clearly made to the jury, and there's no indication\nthat there was confused -- they were confused. There's no\nindication of a fundamental unfairness in this case.\nFinally, I think again this Court has stated in\n-- thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waters.\nMr. Bruck, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRUCK: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe question has come up again concerning the\nhistory of South Carolina's handling of this matter. I\nshould say that a very detailed accounting of the whole\nhistory, legislative and judicial, is provided in the cert\npetition in Simmons itself, and it's not a very edifying\ntale. It really shows that the legislature, when they\nfirst considered a limited life without parole, was\ndeadlocked because of a fear that it would reduce the\nnumber of death sentences, and the legislative compromise\nthat finally came out was we can go ahead and have life\nwithout parole because you don't have to tell the jury\nanyway. So, it won't have any effect. And that was\nthe --\nQUESTION: The Supreme Court of South Carolina,\nI gather from your opponent, shifted its position too.\nMR. BRUCK: Yes, it did.\nQUESTION: And what was the reason for that?\nMR. BRUCK: It's not entirely clear. The\nmembership of the court changed, and indeed, the -- the\nlegislative leader of this proposal to stop telling the\njury or not to tell the jury about parole joined the\ncourt, and then the membership -- and then the court's\nposition changed. If there was a connection, I don't\nknow. But it -- it -- it's an odd history.\nThe -- my friend says that, well, South Carolina\ndoesn't want the jury to know about commutation. For a\nvery good reason. There is no such thing as commutation\nof a life sentence under South Carolina law. We're one of\nonly two life without parole jurisdictions that do not\nallow the Governor to commute a life without parole or any\nprison sentence. The commutation power only extends to\nthe death penalty. So, there is a pardon power which --\nQUESTION: When you say commutation, that's all\nsynonymous with --\nMR. BRUCK: Clemency.\nQUESTION: -- clemency?\nMR. BRUCK: That's right.\nThere is a pardon power which, according to the\nrecord in Simmons, has never been exercised, and by its\nterms requires a showing of the most extraordinary\ncircumstances.\nAnd there -- so, South Carolina's life without\nparole is as locked down as any State's. The idea that,\nwell, there's lots of play is simply not so, and -- and so\nthere's very little that the State could come back with.\nBut as a constitutional matter, if there was any\nplay at the joints, absolutely, if the jury is told the\ntruth that there's no parole, the jury can also be told\nthe truth about any possibility of release that might\nexist. We don't deny that for a moment. But the State\nrecognizes that the -- that the real issue is the\nunavailability of parole, and that's why they fight this\ntooth and nail.\nJustice Ginsburg inquired about prior cases in\nwhich the State Supreme Court has reversed under Simmons.\nAnd it's important to keep in mind there are only two, and\nthey both involved cases that were tried before Simmons\ncame down. And that is why in one case the verbatim same\nargument about what to do with him when he is in our midst\nwas made by the prosecutor because they didn't have\nSimmons as the script about what not to say.\nBut since Simmons came down and since\nprosecutors who are of a mind to defeat the rule in\nSimmons have had the -- the facts of Simmons to go by, not\none case by the South Carolina -- the South Carolina\nSupreme Court has not reversed under Simmons in a single\ncase, in every instance.\nNow, it's true that occasionally trial judges\nhave given a life without parole instruction under\nSimmons. Oftentimes it's because a prosecutor, out of a\nbasic sense of fairness, does not take the position that\nthe prosecutor took in this case. We're really dealing\nwith a due process rule where you sort of feel it in your\nheart that there's something wrong, and that applies to\nprosecutors and judges too. But when a prosecutor decides\nto -- to use the Simmons script, they've had very good\nsuccess in having this instruction not given.\nAnd I should say that if this -- if these facts\nare now held by this high Court to be not to trigger the\nrule in Simmons, you will see that as being -- as being\nthe rule. Now, it's possible that the legislature will\nstep in. It's equally possible, after such a large\nloophole in Simmons, a loophole that will swallow the\nentire case, is decided by this Court --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bruck.\nMR. BRUCK: Thank you.\n"
