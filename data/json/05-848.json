        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Environmental Defense\nversus Duke Energy Corporation. Mr. Donahue.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN H. DONAHUE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. DONAHUE: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Clean Air Act requires that the owner of\na major emitting facility obtain a prevention of\nsignificant deterioration permit before engaging in a\nmodification, which is defined to include any physical\nchange that increases the amount of any pollutant\nemitted by such source.\nSince 1980, EPA's PSD regulations have\nmeasured such increases in terms of actual emissions in\ntons per year.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a disputed\npoint, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the\nregulations measured PSD emissions through that device\nrather than the hourly emissions.\nMR. DONAHUE: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but the text of the regulations refers\npervasively, and I'm referring to the definition of\nmajor modification which is in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2) and\nsubsequent paragraphs of that regulation, refers\npervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions\nexclusively in tons per year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is a little of an\nexaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the\nissuance of the regulations always interpreted them the\nway that you prefer. In fact, the director of the PSD\nprogram gave two opinions in which he took precisely the\ninterpretation that opposing counsel took.\nMR. DONAHUE: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nRespondent has relied heavily on two early applicability\ndeterminations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Rightly so, I think. I\nmean, it was the earliest, application of the\nregulation by the officer of the agency specifically in\ncharge of the program.\nMR. DONAHUE: Well, Justice Scalia, as we\npoint out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt\nDuke's theory, in fact contradicts it. He doesn't say\nthat a new source performance standard modification must\nprecede a PSD major modification. Instead, in both he\nrelies on the express exclusion in the PSD regulations\nfor increases in hours of operation and the production\nrate, and as EPA explained in its contemporaneous\npreamble, that provision by its terms is an exception\nfrom the definition of physical change.\nIt is not a provision that says -- increase\nis attributable to a physical change, to increased hours\nthat are enabled by physical change, are not considered.\nThe plain language of the regulation actually\ncontradicts this reading. These determinations\nthemselves are quite ambiguous, and of course they are\ntwo of dozens of such determinations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, whatever the reason\nhe gave, was it -- these opinions were out there when\nthe challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not\nparticipate, when that challenge was brought, were\nthese -- were those opinions already out there?\nMR. DONAHUE: Those opinions were out there\nbut the plain language of the regulation and the\npreamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion\nwas simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to\nlink the coverage of PSD to construction activity. What\nwe have here is a physical change in the plants, massive\nrenovations of these elaborate networks of pipes and\ntubes that compose a central component.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, and I\nthink you may have the better of the argument on me on\nthe interpretation of the PSD regulations. But what I\nam concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed.\nThey don't challenge the regulations when they come out\nbecause as far as they know, the agency is interpreting\nthem in a way that they favor. And then some years\nlater, when it turns out the agency is using a different\ninterpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.\nMR. DONAHUE: Well, Justice Scalia, these\nregulations were challenged early on and there was a --\nas the Court is aware, there was a settlement agreement\nin 1982 to which Duke was, in fact, a party, that\nproposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely\nabsent from these regulations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But could Duke have had a\nchallenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations? Could they\nhave reopened the issue at that point?\nMR. DONAHUE: They did in fact precisely that,\nJustice Kennedy, and that was resolved in the New York\nproceeding by the D.C. Circuit. Duke didn't challenge\nthe very prominent aspect of the 1980 regulations, which\nwas to move away from the potential emissions test of\nprior --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to jump ahead\nto the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about\nthe modification substantive point first, but it is not\nclear to me whether Duke should have acted in 1980,\n1992 or 2000, or all of the above.\nMR. DONAHUE: Well, the regulations were\nclear on their face. I mean, to determine the effect of\n307 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an audacious\nstatement.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've wrestled with these\nthings for several days. It's disappointing to hear you\ntell us they're clear.\nMR. DONAHUE: They're clear in this respect,\nthey did not include an hourly rate test. As Judge Posner\nin the Cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument\nthat the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a\nchallenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations\nbecause they don't say it, they don't provide for it,\nand they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn\non actual annual emissions. And the entire rationale\nEPA offered was linked to that effort to capture real\nworld changes in emissions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they are so clear, how\ncan you account for Mr. Reich's interpretation? He's an\nexpert in the area.\nMR. DONAHUE: Right. He misapplied, he\ndidn't adopt this theory, the theory that an NSPS\nmodification precedes at all; in fact, he contradicted\nit. He misapplied in quite sort of anomalous\ncircumstances the increased hours --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I know you say he's wrong,\nbut if somebody in his position with his expertise can\ninterpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show\nthat they're not clear on their face?\nMR. DONAHUE: We think that this Court can\nresolve, can interpret, can address the reasonableness\nof EPA's construction of the increased hours exclusion.\nWhat it can't do is certainly what the Fourth Circuit\ndid, which is to say that the PSD regulations must be\nthe same. They are obviously not the same. They are\ndifferent in multiple respects. And certainly that\nchallenge could have been raised, and certainly that\nchallenge was barred, and of course the court of appeals\nexpressly called the regulations irrelevant, the texts\nand interpretations of the regulations. That's exactly\nwhat a court is supposed to be doing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. In deciding whether\nthe regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper\nfor a court to take into account that the regulations\nmust follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD\ndefinition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS\ndefinition? I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory --\nor regulatory construction.\nCannot a court give great weight to that in\ninterpreting these ambiguous regulations?\nMR. DONAHUE: Well, that -- they're not\nambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold\nthat they have to be is certainly an invalidation. And\nthe D.C. Circuit, of course, held that the statute\ndoesn't require identity as between the two sets of\nregulations. And we're not here on certiorari from the\nNew York decision, we're here on an enforcement action\nin which a court leapt over the express limitations\nimposed on it, declared the language of the regulations\nirrelevant, and indeed misapplied them rather\ndramatically.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think the\nsame argument has necessarily to be made, but the\nquestion still before us is how you interpret the\nregulations. Let's assume that's just a regulatory\ninterpretation question, it's not a statutory question.\nMR. DONAHUE: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But in deciding that,\nwhatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that\nwe're entitled to take into account the necessity that\nthe regulations comply with the statute. And if they\nare ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the\ndirection that it seems to us would provide consistency\nwith the statute. Now does that violate the\njurisdictional bar?\nMR. DONAHUE: No. I have no problem with\nany of that. If the regulations are ambiguous, take\ninto account the statutory text, structure, policies.\nWhat the court below did, of course, was say it doesn't\nmatter what the regulations say, these have to be the\nsame. It forgot that in fact, these regulations were\nvery different. The D.C. Circuit said there's no\nstatutory mandate of identity and that the -- and, of\ncourse, Respondent was there in the D.C. Circuit. It\nwas permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence,\nas the court called it, between NSPS regulations and\nPSD. And the court said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the regulations\nare ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in\ndifferent ways and can change its interpretation over\ntime. Of course, what your friend argues happened here\nis that the agency changed its interpretation in the\ncontext of an enforcement program. Now accepting that\npremise, what is the -- what should Duke have done when\nthat interpretation was changed in an enforcement\nprogram?\nMR. DONAHUE: Accepting that premise, they\ncould have sought an applicability determination. Duke\nknew very well what EPA's interpretation was because of\nthe WEPCO decision. EPA had been -- and subsequent\nactions. In fact, Duke's attorneys were vociferously\ncharging that EPA changed the rules and was acting ultra\nvires.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Donahue, were there\nearlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the\nposition that it took in this action against Duke?\nMR. DONAHUE: Well, in the WEPCO decision --\nI mean, EPA has always taken the position that actual\nannual emissions is the standard under the 1980 rules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But were they, in fact,\nenforcing that standard? So that -- you said that Duke\ncould have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at\nthe time Duke started up its --\nMR. DONAHUE: Certainly. I mean, WEPCO was\nan applicability determination. That was in 1989-90.\nPuerto Rican Cement was an applicability determination.\nDuke instead, knowing that EPA believed that increased\nutilization that is caused by physical change has to be\nconsidered under this, as is prescribed in these very\ndetailed regulations, Duke decided not to do that, to go\nforward, and it didn't, in fact, come to the State or to\nEPA.\nOf course, the increased hours -- I\nunderstand the Court's concern about the Reich memos.\nBut EPA's construction of the increased hours exception\nis completely correct under the plain language of the\nregulations. And in WEPCO the Court upheld. So that\nthere was no question that not only was it consistent\nwith the plain language, but whatever Reich had said,\nthe express language of the regulations was as far as\nthe exception went. There was no further confusion, if\nthose early memos caused confusion.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my\ntime. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Donahue.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals exceeded its\njurisdiction and misconstrued the Clean Air Act in\nholding that EPA was required to define the term\n\"modification\" identically for the separate NSPS and PSD\nprograms, and on the jurisdictional point I'd like to\naddress the whipsaw question, because in fact it's quite\nclear that there's no whipsaw issue here for a number of\nreasons. It's true that there are those ambiguous and\ncursory 1981 statements from Mr. Reich, who was a\nsubordinate official within EPA. In 1988, the\nadministrator of EPA, the head of the agency, in the\nWEPCO decision, the applicability determination, made\nvery clear what EPA's position is on the application of\nthe hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this\nis an annual tons per year test. That's page 44 of the\njoint appendix. He made that perfectly clear and it has\nalways been clear that that is, in fact, the EPA's official\nposition beginning with the 1980 preamble. But again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Should a challenge\nto that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that\ntime, or would you have argued that's too late?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not sure whether it\ncould have been brought at that time. But the fact of\nthe matter is a challenge was brought on this issue\nin -- to the 1980 regulations. True, Duke didn't assert\nit, but General Motors and the steel industry did assert\nin the 1981 brief they filed in that challenge to the\n1980 rule --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably\nDuke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we\nwere following that and all of a sudden this new 1988\nthing came up and they are surprised by that. Now\nyou're saying it's already too late because somebody\nelse challenged it in 1980?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, they might have that\nargument, Your Honor, except for the fact that the\nchallenge to the 1980 rules was stayed and was not\nreopened until 2003.\nIn 2003, Duke and other parties sought to\nreopen and were granted permission to reopen that\nchallenge to the 1980 rules. They filed a statement of\nissues in 1984 and a brief in 1984 challenging the\nregulation on the ground that if EPA's interpretation\nwas correct and that it did not require an increase in\nmaximum total achievable emissions, as the NSPS did,\ntest did, they argued that it was invalid. They raised\nthe very incorporation theory that they advance here,\nthat is the statutory argument that Congress was\nrequired to follow for the PSD regulations the same\nregulatory approach that the NSPS regulations had\nfollowed in 1977 with the hourly maximum achievable\ntest. They made that very argument in their brief in\nthe D.C. Circuit in 2004, the D.C. Circuit addressed and\nrejected that argument on the merits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To be fair to them,\nthat very same argument was more a product of the Fourth\nCircuit than of Duke. They had a somewhat different\napproach before the Fourth Circuit and then the Fourth\nCircuit came up with this insistence on the parallel\nconstruction.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. Well, I think it's\nimportant to distinguish. There are two statutory\narguments here. One is what I would call the\nincorporation theory. That is the argument that\nCongress by borrowing the definition, the statutory\ndefinition, also necessarily borrowed and mandated\nadoption of the regulatory definition from the NSPS\nprogram. That argument, the incorporation argument, was\nmade by Duke in its brief in 2004 in the D.C. Circuit.\nThe D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument at\npages 17 through 19 of its decision in its 2005 New York\ndecision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why was that rejection\nwrong? Because this issue is still important to me for\npurposes of statutory construction. Is it conceivable\nthat when Congress says the word widget in this statute\nhas to mean the same as the word widget in the other\nstatute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the\napparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I\nmean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can\nadopt regulations under one statute which regulations\nsay it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations\nunder another statute that says it means something else.\nI mean, to say that they have to mean the same\nthing it seems to me means that the regulations have to\nsay they mean the same thing.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, it is a fundamental\nprinciple of administrative law and deference to agency\ndecisionmaking that when Congress adopts an ambiguous\nstatutory phrase and charges the agency with\nimplementing that phrase the agency has discretion, has\na delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking\nauthority to choose from among the various permissible\ninterpretations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it does, but when\nCongress says the definition in the two statutes has to\nbe the same, whatever choice the agency makes among\nthose options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because\nCongress has not mandated, as it could have done, that\nthe choice of the specific interpretation from among the\npermissible options must be identical across both\nprograms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then it's meaningless\nto say the definition has to be the same.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Entirely meaningless.\nMR. HUNGAR: The statutory definition is\nambiguous, but within the limits of the ambiguity it\nimposes constraints on the discretion of the agency.\nThe agency must choose from among the options that are\npermissible given the range of language that Congress\nused. But within that range the agency has discretion.\nThink of it this way, Your Honor. If there were no PSD\nprogram, if we were talking only about the NSPS program,\nCongress gave an ambiguous definition to the agency the\nagency would have discretion to adopt different tests\nfor determining whether emissions increased for\ndifferent types of equipment even within that single\nprogram, because the statutory definition is ambiguous.\nThe statute therefore does not mandate a one size fits\nall approach and the agency in its discretion could well\ndetermine that one emissions test is appropriate for\nsome types of equipment, another emissions test is\nappropriate for other types of equipment, as long as\nboth of those tests are within the permissible bounds\nof the statutory ambiguity. The agency is entitled to\ndo that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the ambiguity is the\nword \"increase,\" which could mean different things?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Government as I\nunderstand it now has a proposed regulation that would\nalign the standards with the two programs. It would\nbring the nonproliferation -- it would bring the\nstandard for the nonproliferation program in line with\nthe new source performance standard.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, with respect\nto certain types of units, electric generating units\nlike those at issue in this case, that's correct. They\nwould not be identical under the proposal, but would be\nsimilar.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, since the\ngovernment is now taking the position that another Duke\ncould do just what was done here and there's an\nenforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed\nin that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though\nit's those against the current government policy?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the 2005 proposal\nthat you're referring to is only a proposal, a notice of\nproposed rulemaking. It has not been adopted. So the\nrules as they exist today are the same as the ones we're\ntalking about, although there was a modification in\n2002. But in any event, what we're talking about here\nis conduct that occurred from 1988 through 2000 with\nrespect to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what exactly are you\nseeking in these enforcement proceedings? An injunction\nto install the BACT or criminal fines or civil fine, or\nwhat?\nMR. HUNGAR: It is civil enforcement\nproceedings, Your Honor. There are various remedies,\ninjunctive relief and civil penalties where appropriate,\nyes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you have an enforcement\nproceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether\nor not the agency's interpretation is consistent with\nthe statute with Chevron deference and so forth and the\ncourt looks at it and says, you know, I have a real\nproblem with the way the agency interpreted the basic\nstatute when it first issued the regulation, the court\ncan't get into that merely because the parties didn't\npresent it earlier?\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The court's almost issuing\nan advisory opinion in a way.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. It's not an\nadvisory opinion. The court is simply precluded from\nconsidering a challenge that would invalidate the\nregulation because that is the determination Congress\nmade in requiring pre-enforcement review to avoid the\nproblem of inconsistent determinations and circuit\nconflicts and 700 district judges potentially construing\nthe statute in different ways and tying EPA's hands.\nThe Congress made that determination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other areas in\nthe law where courts have to take as binding a legal\nproposition that they think is dead wrong when they --\nMR. HUNGAR: It's quite common. It's quite\ncommon, Your Honor, in any regime where review of an\nagency decision is relegated to the exclusive\njurisdiction of one court, as it is here, and\nenforcement proceedings are brought in a different\ncourt. Hobbs Act agencies, their decisions are\nreviewable in the court of appeals but often enforceable\nin the district courts. The district court cannot look\nbehind the determination of the agency to challenge its\nvalidity because that rests in the exclusive jurisdiction\nof the court of appeals. Obviously there's a timing\nissue in this statute as well because of the requirement\nof pre-enforcement review. Whatever -- whatever concerns\nmight be raised in a situation where a party could not\nreasonably have been expected to challenge it at the\ntime it was originally promulgated are addressed by the\nafter-arising provision in section 307(b)(1) which\npermits challenges that could not have been made within\nthe 60-day period to be brought later in appropriate\ncircumstances. And in any event, if there were some\nconcerns at the outer limits of a provision like this\none, they have nothing to do with this case where Duke's\nchallenge, actual challenge to the agency decision, the\n1980 rule, it was heard in 2005.\nAnd so Duke had more opportunity than you\ncould possibly ask for to understand exactly what EPA's\nposition was, understand exactly what the regulation\nmeant and to challenge it in the D.C. Circuit. It did\nso and it can't do it here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, I'm curious.\nWhat happens if you have a new company that wasn't around\nwhen the regulation was issued? Can it -- can it bring a\nchallenge to the conformity of the regulation to the\nstatute?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think that's an\nunresolved question. Presumably, the argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a nice question. I\nmean, all you have to do is find a stalking horse. Just\nhave some new company carry your water for you.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, presumably the argument\nwould be that the creation of the company and the first\napplicability of the regulations to it is an\nafter-arising ground. I don't know the answer to that\nquestion, but certainly it's not presented here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could it bring it up by a\ndeclaration of non-applicability? Could the new\ncompany -- how would it --\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it could seek a\ndetermination of non-applicability, but -- and it could\nobtain judicial review of that determination. But that\nwould not go to the D.C. Circuit and would not permit a\nchallenge to the regulations. But they could find a\npetition, they clearly could find a petition for\nrulemaking with the EPA, saying your regulation is\ninvalid, it's been around for 25 years, but it's still\ninvalid, you need to rescind it, and when the agency\ndeclined to do that they could then go to the D.C. Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the midst of the\nenforcement action that's being brought against them by\nEPA? What's supposed to happen in the enforcement\naction, if that's the vehicle through which EPA is\nimplementing its new interpretation --\nMR. HUNGAR: If this completely speculative\nand hypothetical situation were ever to arise, a court\nmight well exercise its equitable discretion to stay\nproceedings pending review in the D.C. Circuit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you about an\nargument I think they did make? I think they made this\nargument. On page 26 of your brief, I think it's\nexplained well. You set out the regs and the reg says\nthat a major modification is \"any physical change in the\nmethod of operation that would lead to a significant net\nemissions increase.\" Then you have little (iii), which\nis an exception, and it excepts a physical change which\nleads to -- is just an increase in the hours of\noperation or the production rate.\nSo that's out of it. Now, the question is\nwhat's in it? If that's out of it, what's in it? I\nthink what they've said is, if you think about that,\nwe'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical\nchange that does nothing to increase the capacity, but\njust means you can run it more hours. And they say their\nproof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation\nfor years and years and years. Indeed, we did what we\ndid thinking that was it.\nAnd then after we did what we did, they\npulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't\nit; now it means any physical change, like you change a\nnut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased\ncapacity to emit more. It's just you run it more hours.\nNow, that they say is basically unfair, it's\nnot what this reg has been about. And they made that\nargument, according to them, very strongly and the\nFourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all\naround and made some propositions of law that it's hard\nfor even them to defend.\nAll right. Now, that's what I think, that's\nwhat I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the\nheart of it. And if it is, what do you say?\nMR. HUNGAR: There are several things, Your\nHonor. First of all the language of the regulation\nsimply does not support that interpretation. What the\nregulation says is that hours of -- a change in hours of\noperation is not a physical change. Fine. But we have\na physical change here. It is undisputed that Duke made\nphysical changes to its facilities, major modifications,\nsort of using that term in the non-regulatory sense, but\nsubstantial replacements of physical equipment at the\nfacilities. So physical change has occurred. The hours\nof operation exclusion, therefore, has no longer any\nrelevance because it applies only at the physical change\nstep of the analysis.\nThere has been a physical change here\nregardless of whether hours of operation changed or not.\nTherefore, the hours of operation exclusion no longer\napplies. The next question is whether the -- if the\nphysical change that did occur resulted in a significant\nnet emissions increase. Here it did under the plain\nlanguage of the regulations and under the test that EPA\napplies. It is true that 1981 they were arguably\nmistaken to the extent one can discern what the,\nMr. Reich was actually saying, they seem to be simply a\nmistake in interpretation. But in 1988, the\nadministrator of the agency, the head of the agency,\nmade very clear EPA's position, the very same position\nit is taking here today on the hours of operation\nexclusion. The First Circuit in the Puerto Rican Cement\ncase, as Your Honor knows, upheld that interpretation in\n1989. The Seventh Circuit in footnote 11 in the WEPCO\ndecision upheld that determination in 1990. It was\nrestated by the EPA again and again and it is well\nestablished.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT BY CARTER G. PHILLIPS,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think I am inclined instead of starting\nwith the jurisdictional issue to focus initially on the\nregulatory history immediately in the wake of the 1980\nrules. Because it seems to me it is very clear that the\nunderstanding of everyone in the industry, outside the\nindustry, from 1980, candidly well beyond 1988 all the\nway up until 1999, was that these regulations didn't apply\nunder any circumstances in the absence of an increase in\nthe capacity. And you had to demonstrate that there\nwould be an increase in the hourly rate of the\nemissions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why were some\ncompanies asking for declarations of nonapplicability?\nMR. PHILLIPS: To confirm precisely that\ninterpretation. That's exactly why GE went to Mr. Reich\nand asked for a determination of applicability, and was\ntold categorically PSD applicability is determined by\nevaluating any change in emissions rates caused by the\nconversion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Donahue said that\nthere were nonapplicability applications after those\nearly ones that came out the other way. So there were\ncompanies --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who asked for a\ndeclaration of nonapplication and then EPA took the\nposition that it is currently taking.\nMR. PHILLIPS: As I heard Mr. Donahue, he\nwas talking about WEPCO. Understand the context of\nWEPCO. WEPCO was a situation where every one of the\nchanges was a modification within the meaning of NSPS.\nAnd then the question is were they also modification --\nmajor modifications within the -- within the meaning of\nthe PSD. And that's what they analyzed. So it didn't\nsay anything about the argument we've been making which\nis what is a modification. The only statements that I\nknow of that are out there are the two Reich statements\nwhich I just quoted to you, says exactly our\ninterpretation. But even more powerful at least in my\nview is the quotation from the amicus brief from the\nState of Alabama and the 12 States that relied on the\nRegion 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that\namicus brief and the answer, the question is -- you\nknow -- how do you determine what is a modification?\nYou know does something that doesn't increase the hours,\nthe emissions per hour, constitute it? It says no.\nSince the modification does not cause any increase in\nthe hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual\nemissions should be calculated. They could not have said\nthat any more clearly than --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who was saying that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is the -- it is the\nchief of the air and waste management division, James\nWolburn, giving guidance to Region 4. Region 4 is not\nonly Alabama, it is also North Carolina and South\nCarolina. And then, in the wake of this, right? 1982,\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina submit their SIPs and\nin their SIPs, certainly the South Carolina SIP\nexpressly incorporates the concept of modification.\nNorth Carolina a little less expressly incorporates the\nentirety of the regulatory scheme under title 50 -- under\npart 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It looks like -- I went\nback and read the Puerto Rico cement case. And it\ncertainly looks as if -- though the issue was somewhat\ndifferent. It looks as if the interpretation that the\nEPA is taking there is not consistent with what you are\nreading now and is consistent with what they're saying\ntoday. And that was in 1988-89, I guess. They must have\nbeen starting on that in '87. So it seemed to me we have a\nmixed bag. Some people were saying the one thing. Some\npeople were saying the other thing. And the later in time\nseems to be the Puerto Rico cement. And that was at\nleast 17 years ago. And --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nPuerto Rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem.\nBecause what you are dealing with there is the\nelimination of two existing units, the two kilns, and a\nreplacement with a brand-new unit, which would have been\na modification under any -- I think under anybody's\ntheory, because there would have been an increase in the\nhourly emissions anyway. So it would have been a NSPS\nsubject to the PSD. It didn't get analyzed that way but\nthe truth is it would have been fully -- the way that\ndecision came out would have been exactly\nconsistent with the way that they analyzed it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The analysis which was\nprobably pretty much based on what they said, I think\nwas that the reason there was increased potential here\nto pollute, was really because this change would permit\nthe plant to be run more intensively or more hours,\nsomething like that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that was based on the\nquestion of involving you know, normal operations or\nnon-normal operations. The Court really didn't have to\naddress -- and I don't think did address the question of\nhow do you relate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, we didn't address it.\nI'm not taking it as evidence of that. I'm taking it as\nevidence that the EPA then had a basic position similar\nto what they have now.\nThat's what I'm using it as a basis for\nthinking that they were not saying to have a change, the\nword \"change\" includes only a change in physical\nfacilities that increases the amount of emission per\nhour. Am I right? Or --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think they were\nreally arguing that particular point. I mean, that's\nnot the way I would have read the argument that EPA was\nmaking. But, and the bottom line is they didn't address\nthis issue in WEPCO. To the extent they came close to\naddressing this issue in WEPCO they lost it in the\nSeventh Circuit because WEPCO adopted an interpretation\nthat's much closer to what we are asking for.\nThe answer given on the other side at this\npoint, that we should have -- we should have sought a\ndetermination. Well, the problem with that, of course,\nis every one of these projects was being inspected. The\nrecord is replete with examples from North Carolina and\nSouth Carolina and EPA inspectors on site looking at\nevery one of these projects.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then they'll say your\nargument here, even if you are right, I think they think\nyou're wrong -- but even if you're right, they'll say\nwell, that's an argument that it is arbitrary, capricious\nabuse of discretion for them to change horses in the\nmiddle of the stream, i.e., for them to take an\ninterpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without\nadequate notice and comment and so forth radically\nreverse that interpretation. Now that's not the issue in\nfront of us now.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that is the issue in\nfront of you, I believe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They say because the Fourth\nCircuit didn't go really on that, it went on some\nstatutory thing, and --\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, but that's the\nopinion. That's not the judgment. The judgment of the\ncourt of appeals is that this enforcement--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question, Mr.\nPhillips? Focusing on this question in the amicus brief\nwhich the EPA representative answered no. Supposing\nthe EPA had answered yes at that time. Would that have\nbeen a permissible answer within the meaning of the\nstatute?\nMR. PHILLIPS: If -- I'm not sure I\nunderstood the predicate of the question, Justice Stevens.\nWhich question are you asking?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You know -- what's that,\npage 7 and 8 of the -- of a source to modified\nhave to have a significant increase in the SO2 elements.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I see.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they answered no. You\nsay they were right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just asking -- want to\nknow, under the statute, could they have answered yes\nand would that have been a permissible answer?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, our position would be no.\nThat would have been an -- inappropriate under the\nrationale of Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're not basically\nrelying on the fact that you were misled, you're\nbasically relying on the fact that they have interpreted\nthe statute incorrectly.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, actually we're\nmaking both arguments. Our basic argument is that all\nalong, they have interpreted it in a certain way. And\nthen 19 years later, they reversed course. And that is\narbitrary and capricious, Justice Breyer, and it is a\nbasis on which to defend the judgment of the court of\nappeals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is what the government\nis saying here is that suppose the regulation can be\ninterpreted to say X or Y. X would hurt the company; Y\nwould not. Is the government saying, if it is\nforeseeable that the agency might take the\nunfavorable position, you then must challenge it in the\nD.C. Circuit?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that's exactly what\nthey have to be arguing. And it seems to me that that\ncannot be what 307(b)(1) means. Justice Kennedy, you\nasked a great question. Should we have raised this in\n1980, 1992, 2000? When were we supposed to bring this\nup? And the truth is in 1980 we interpreted this\nstatute, the regulation, exactly the same way EPA did.\nIt would have been silly for us to raise that. It is\ntrue that this issue comes up 25 years later in a\nbizarre proceeding. But that's not what 307(b)(2) is\nall about. It says you are precluded from making a\nchallenge in an enforcement action if the action of the\nadministrator was subject to challenge. Well, the\naction of the administrator was not subject to challenge\nin 1980. And when we did have the subsequent\nrulemaking --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just a pause, under\nyour view or the Fourth Circuit's view? If you read\nJudge Tatel's opinion in New York versus EPA, he\nsuggests -- suggests, he says that EPA adopted different\ninterpretations of modification from the outset. And so\nif what you are saying couldn't have been challenged,\nwas the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate.\nBut if you are saying what couldn't have been\nanticipated was the argument you actually made to the\nFourth Circuit, that might be a different story.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, I think that, that\nis precisely what we are saying. But you know, Judge\nTatel, with all due respect to him, is dead wrong.\nBecause the interpretation of modification under NSPS\nand under the regulatory PSD was identical. The\nregulations couldn't be any clearer in that regard\nbecause if you look at 15a of our appendix, you know,\nthe modification, this is the NSPS definition -- I'm\nsorry, better go back a page. 17a. 60.14\nmodification defines emission rate and the emission rate\nis expressed as kilogram per hour. So that is\nabsolutely clear that that is the NSPS --\nDobbs modification.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the NSPS section.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's the NSPS section.\nThen you go two pages earlier to 15a and you have the\nPSD regulatory definition, and it comes right back to\nemission rate, or the regulatory history that says the\nemission rate as used in this provides is identical --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They say that that\nprovision only applies when there is no SIP. And that's\nnot this case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in the first place it\nwould apply in at least South Carolina immediately\nbecause there is a SIP that incorporates exactly the\nsame language. And second of all, the notion that this\nregulation is inoperative on one side and fully\noperative on the other side make no sense. It makes\nmuch more sense to recognize that modification is the\ntrigger for construction which is in part 51(2) and that\nthat incorporates this entire modification language.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nIt seems to me each part has had different definitions\nand this definition only applies to part 52 which\napplies when there is no SIP.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how you can\nsay it automatically applies when there is a SIP.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The way that would apply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Part 51, in other words.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Go back to then -- you\nhave to go back to 12(a), I think it is where we talk\nabout the interpretation and we get to construction.\nThis is (b)(8), construction means a modification, okay,\nof an emissions unit. So that -- and modification, if it\nis undefined in title 51, right? According to 15.100,\nmeans whatever it means under the statute. So that just\ntakes you back to the statute. And this is the\ninterpretation under the statute. The 52 interpretation\nis also an interpretation under the statute.\nSo it is completely circular and brings you\nright back to the same definition. I agree by its terms\nit doesn't apply to 51. But going through the\ndefinitional provision in part 51 through the definition\nof the trigger for construction, which is modification,\nit takes you right back to the same meaning of the same\nprovisions.\nSo there is no difference between the two.\nAnd to me, it is really critical. And it seems to me\nthere are sort of two points to make here. One is\nnobody on the Petitioner's side of this case answers the\nState -- the dozen States who say we relied upon you\nwhen we adopted these SIPs. We realized that you are\nasking us to take on enormous burdens. And you should\nhave told us that before we went down this path in the\nfirst place.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, before you\nget away from this section 52, because I think that is\nthe best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is\nthere any sensible reason why you would want to have a\ndifferent definition of modification for non-SIP\nsituations than you would for SIP situations?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Absolutely not. I mean,\nyou would -- you -- there is no rational --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That occurred to me when--\nMR. PHILLIPS: And I have not heard the other\nside make an argument that there is a rational\ndistinction between the two. And the truth is if EPA\nwanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving, that\nis to eliminate the concept of modification, what it\nshould have done is two things.\nIt should have -- it should have deleted\n52.01. And it should have adopted the proposed\nregulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs.\nThis is on page 9 of their brief. This statement is\nastonishing to me. \"The term major modification serves\nas the definition of modification or modified when used\nin the act in reference to a major stationary source.\"\nIf they had adopted that regulation in 1980, I\nwouldn't had to litigate this issue 25 years later.\nWe would have litigated this question in 1980 because\nthen we would have said that's flatly inconsistent with\nthe statutory scheme because you're not entitled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're quoting page 9?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Page 9 of their reply brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, in their reply brief?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The SG's reply brief, I apologize.\nThe gray brief. Where they seek to get some support for\nthe idea that modification was dropped out of this\nanalysis. But the truth is, that was a proposed rule\nthat would have done exactly what they say that the 1980\nrule did without adopting that particular regulation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I ask\nanother sort of basic question? In your view, would it\nbe permissible for the agency to interpret the word --\nto adopt a regulatory interpretation of the -- in the\nPSD regulations of the word \"modification\" that was\ndifferent from the definition it used under the new\nsource regulations?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Substantively different?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Substantively different.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think that would be\nimpermissible\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think the statute\nrequired the regulation to be identical?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I don't understand how\nit's possible that Congress says in the statute that you\ntake the NSPS trigger -- remember, this is not just some\nrandom definition we're talking about. Construction is\nthe trigger for this part of this entire regulatory\nscheme, and modification is the trigger, and say it is\nas defined in, and they did it twice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your answer is no?\nMR. PHILLIPS: My answer is no.\n(Laughter.).\nMR. PHILLIPS: I thought I said that first.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's definitely no.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's a no with some\nemphasis.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it have been\npermissible for the agency to adopt one definition for\n10 years and then change the definition to the other\ndefinition for all programs?\nMR. PHILLIPS: For all of it?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think there is plenty\nof room within that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So either definition could\ncomply with the statute?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think as long as you\nmaintain consistency between the two, there is a fair\namount of discretion for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The obvious reason to do it\nis, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say,\nwhich is quite clean in the air. And there is a power\nplant. And what somebody works out, which is normal, is\ndemand for electricity is increasing. And so what we\nwill do is we're going to take these turbines and\nsystem, and we're going to change it really radically.\nIt doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now\nwe can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it\n12 hours a day. So there's going to be twice as much\npollution in the air. Now the whole idea of the PSD\nsystem is you don't have twice as much pollution in the\nair, and I guess that's why they wanted to do it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the premise of\nthat is, the real question is, if Congress had meant\nthat, why would Congress have adopted the same word,\nmodification, as the construction trigger that existed\nin NSPS?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because you can use the\nsame word, you can apply the same word in different\nplaces differently, depending on what your basic object\nis in the different place. It's very hard to say what\nkind of modification might exist over here, there, the\nother place. And you put your finger on a very\ndifficult question for power companies, because those\nturbines do go at different amounts of rates and so\nforth during a day, during a month, during a year, so\nit's hard for them. Therefore, you have a complex\ndefinition.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because by the time the\nstatute came up for review by Congress, and the PSD\nprogram, the new source review, there was already a very\nextensive regulatory history about the meaning of the\nterm \"modification.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think what's wrong\nwith it is that you could have achieved that same result\nby simply not saying that modification in one program\nhas to mean the same as modification in the other. If\nyou didn't say that, that would be the result. You give\nmodification whatever meaning you think is reasonable\nhere. You give it whatever reading you think is\nreasonable in the other place. But when you say the two\nhave to be the same, it seems to me you have something\nelse in mind.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And it also seems to me,\nJustice Breyer, it clearly creates an obligation on the\npart of EPA to be very explicit if it's, in fact, going\nto do what you say it's going to do. You don't go about\nsaying I am going to define modification in one statute\nfundamentally different from the way I define\nmodification in another statute without discussing the\nword modification.\nAnd to put this in context, you'll remember,\nthese regulations were adopted in the wake of the Alabama\nPower decision. Alabama Power didn't deal with the\nissue of modification. That wasn't before the court.\nNobody had challenged modification's definition. The\nhourly emissions rate was a perfectly valid one. What\nthe court in Alabama Power said is, you can't use this\nthreshold for major modification. And then the case --\nso then the matter comes back, and if EPA immediately\nadopts a new set of regulations that deal what, with\nwhat? Major modification, not with modification.\nAnd then they go through this entire\nelaborate analysis of major modification, none of which,\ncandidly, do we challenge. We have no quarrel with\ntheir interpretation of the concept of major\nmodification. If anybody does, my guess is the State\nenvironmental groups would.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They make a kind of\ninteresting argument, major modification is not a subset\nof modification.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yeah. And if the Solicitor,\nand if EPA had enacted the regulation that they proposed\nbut didn't enact, that says major modification means\nmodification, then we might have an argument there. But\nthe concept that when you have modification as a core\nbaseline construction -- I mean trigger for the\napplicability of this portion of the scheme, and then\nyou take that same -- and you not only do it once but\nyou do it twice, and you do it in the context of an\nentire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement\nthis statutorily -- or implement this before the statute\nwas enacted, and you have Congress saying well, you\ndidn't get that right, but you did get this right, and\nthey leave this language exactly in the way it is, the\nonly fair inference you can draw from that, it seems to\nme --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because the language,\nI don't see anywhere in the statute where -- the words\nof modification are, it's a physical changing or change\nin a method of operation which increases the amount of\nany air pollutant. Now those words, \"physical change\nwhich increases the amount of any air pollutant,\" could\nmean different things in different places.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say in the\nstatute that they can't?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Where it says in the statute\nis where it makes this specific cross-reference, because\nif all they wanted to do was get that definition, all\nthey had to do was use the word modification. They\ndidn't have to use modification as defined --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, I want to be\nsure I understand your position. Are you saying the\nstatutory text in effect says every regulation using the\nword modification must employ the same definition, or\nare you relying on a general principle that when the\nsame word is used it should be used in the same way?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's a general principle\nthat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there's nothing in the\nstatute itself that says that principle shall apply to\nthis case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but the general principle\nis that if the same language is used in two different\nportions, you presume they have the same meaning. When\nyou go beyond that -- because otherwise, their\ninterpretation rendered superfluous the specific\ncross-references to as defined in and as used in; and\nwhile I know some don't like the legislative history,\nthe legislative history is quite clear that they had in\nmind, and regulatory history as well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your answer is you\nare not relying simply on the general principle. It is\nnot just that they used the word modification in one\nplace and the word modification in the other. It's that\nin the latter place, they said modification as defined\nin the first place.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It depends on which general\nprinciple, I suppose you're talking about. I'm not\nrelying on the mere presumption. I think this is much\nstronger than the mere presumption.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your reference of\nmodification as defined elsewhere merely defines the\nscope of the statutory meaning. That's not the same as\nsaying every regulation that is a modification must be\nthe same no matter what the program.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think if you read it in\ncontext, when you recognize that what Congress was doing\nis adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a\nregulatory scheme that was well established with very\nspecific meanings, and where Congress quite clearly\npicked and chose -- I think that's the way to say it --\nfrom the regulatory scheme, and said we'll take these\nand not take those, and has a provision at the end --\n168 says, all the regulations remain in effect until\nthey get changed at some point, suggesting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I\nunderstand the point. If instead of saying as defined\nin X, the second statute had merely quoted the same\nwords that were in X, would your argument be the same?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. It would not be nearly\nas strong as it is. We would still have a\npresumption --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that if\nyou used the definition as defined in another statute,\nthat implicitly says all regulations defining this term\nmust be identical.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know if I have to go\nquite that far because I have more evidence than that in\nthis particular case, because I have the fact that they\nsay as used in, which suggests that it's more than just\na definitional point. We do have a legislative history\nthat seems to have in mind this regulatory background;\nand we've been told by EPA that when Congress\nincorporated modification, it really did incorporate\nthat luggage, baggage as well.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This is very helpful to\nme, because the government has accused you of abandoning\nthe court of appeals approach to the case, and I think\nyou're endorsing the court of appeals.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I do endorse it. The only\nquestion I have -- I mean, I don't think that it\nnecessarily has to be -- that every word has to be\nidentical in the two provisions, but I do think they\nhave to be congruent. And so, that's the strong version\nof our argument, and that's pretty close to where the\nFourth Circuit was.\nThe weaker version of our argument, which\ngets I think some mileage on the arbitrary and\ncapricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if\nCongress adopts as the trigger point the same word in\ntwo statutes, and EPA then purports to be implementing\nthat statute, it has some obligation to explain how it\nis that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term\nmodification. And the reason --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just a matter of\nusing the same word.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. You're right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a matter of a statute\nwhich says it shall have the same meaning.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. They owe us some\nresponsibility to explain, how do you not follow that\ncourse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could they have said\nthat construction means both modification and then come\nup with a new word, alteration? Because the statute\nsays the term construction includes modification, so\nI -- construction can be broader. Could it be an\nalteration, they would come up with a new term of art,\nand add that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to the PSD?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Could they have gotten away\nwith that? I mean, that would have been a much stronger\nargument. It seems to me the better argument, and --\nbut see, the point here is if they had done that, or if\nthey had done what they proposed in 1979, which is just\nto simply redefine major modification to be\nmodification, then we would have taken that issue\ndirectly to the D.C. Circuit at that point in time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you do have a brief\nhere. You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which\nis Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions\nDefinition.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And throughout that brief\nit refers again and again to the problem, their proposed\nreg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which\nis change the machine so it puts out more per minute or\nwhatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even\nthough you don't change the capacity of the machine.\nThere's a whole brief on that. So you already argued\nthat whole brief, that what they were doing was\ninconsistent with the statute, et cetera.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The other side has not argued\ncollateral estoppel, if that's the argument you're\ntrying to make, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. As being outside the\nstatute at that time, and you did.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you have to put that\ninto context. We're talking about a matter that was\nclosed for 25 years and then was reopened. And this\nargument -- and it is true, a variant of this argument\nwas made. I don't think it's the full argument that\nwe've made before this Court. And it was rejected by\nthe D.C. Circuit. But if you're arguing that as a\n307(b) argument, my answer to that is this is still not\naction by the administrator that would trigger a 307(b)\nbar. If you're asking about collateral estoppel, my\nargument is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I was just thinking,\nthen you're left with what you called the weak argument,\narbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see\nhow you make the stronger one, what you think is\nstronger, since you made it before, or a version of\nit before the D.C. Circuit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, if you are\narguing that as a matter of collateral estoppel, then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, not collateral\nestoppel, but you know, I'd be repeating myself.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But if it's not collateral\nestoppel and it's not 307(b)(2), then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it is.\nMR. PHILLIPS: So you are doing it as --\nsee, I don't think it -- I think if you read 307(b)(2)'s\nlanguage, it talks about action of the administrator,\nand what action of the administrator are we, in fact,\nchallenging here? Nothing. Because in our view, the\n1980 regulation quite clearly says what we want it to\nsay. The only thing that's changed is that the\npreambles have interpreted the 1980. We challenged that\nand the D.C. Circuit said no, we're not going to address\nthat issue. That's an issue when you get back up, when\nyou get back on your enforcement action. Then you can\ncomplain about that aspect of it. That issue is not\nripe. And that is exactly what we are trying to argue\nin this case. And it's a variant of what I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I go\nback for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the\nsame meaning as in (b). Is it not correct under your\nview of the statute that that meaning can include either\nof the two definitions that the two regulations\nidentify? So that either -- whether you start with (a)\nor the second statute, either statute includes both --\nmay include both alternative regulations?\nMR. PHILLIPS: As long as they are\nconsistent?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That is my position,\nJustice Stevens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you explain to\nme again why this isn't a 307(b) problem? You said this\nis an action by the administrator?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Because there is no\naction of the administrator that we would challenge.\nThe only action of the administrator was the 1980\nregulation, which we interpret as not changing\nmodification. If you read 52.01(d), it clearly retains\nmodification. We have no quarrel, then, with what the\nadministrator did in 1980.\nThen they adopt preambles to the subsequent\nregs. We do challenge those, but the D.C. Circuit said\nwe're not entitled to do that, that's got to wait for an\nenforcement action. The only thing that's left out\nthere is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the\nadministrator. But there's no final action by the\nadministrator for us to challenge. Then the only\nquestion would be, do we have some obligation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can't challenge\nin the D.C. Circuit the administrator's interpretation\nthat led to the enforcement action?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know how that's a\nfinal action. The filing of a complaint, as this Court\nheld in Harrison, is not a final action. So that\ndoesn't trigger it, and I don't know what else is out\nthere for us to serve as a hook. I would think at a\nminimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to\njump on a expansive interpretation of 307(b) where it\noperates in a context like this as a pure gotcha. You\nadopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with, you\nchange the regulation afterwards and then you come back and\nyou say you can't challenge it at this point. That just\ncannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Donahue, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN H. DONAHUE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. DONAHUE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nYou just can't read the 1980 regulations to\nachieve the result Duke is seeking here. There is no\nhourly rate in there, and it's important to note that\nthese provisions that they now state misled them into\ntheir non-challenge, they didn't even cite to the Fourth\nCircuit or the district court, and on their face,\nthey're not -- it's not plausible that these provisions,\nwhich are totally nonspecific, were intended to vary the\nvery detailed and specific instructions on how to\nmeasure an emissions increase laid out. And the\npreamble --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the one in part 52\nsurely does. You have to give them that.\nMR. DONAHUE: No, I don't give them that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't give them that.\nMR. DONAHUE: Because it says rate, and the\n1980 PSC regulations say that the relevant rate is tons\nper year. They use the word \"rate\" pervasively.\nI would also say the preamble to the rule\nmakes conclusively clear that \"major modification\" is\nEPA's definition of the statutory term. This idea that\nEPA, it's completely inconsistent with not only --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Major -- when you say\nthe statutory term, you mean \"modification\"?\nMR. DONAHUE: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then why weren't\nthose proposed regulations saying just that, adopted?\nMR. DONAHUE: I don't know the answer to\nthat, but it's absolutely clear. EPA has never said\notherwise. And of course the idea that an NSPS\nmodification is required first, it would have been a big\ndeal. There is no sign of it, and in fact there are\nspecific examples. The example cited at page 23 of the\ngovernment's opening brief in the preamble is a PSD\nmajor modification that would not be an NSPS --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a tough sell,\nisn't it? I mean, the idea is you propose regulations\nsaying major modification means modification. Those\nregulations are not adopted, and then the industry is\nsupposed to be on notice that that's still what you\nmean?\nMR. DONAHUE: I think that there's no other\nreading of what EPA meant from the regulations. No one\nwas confused by this, Chief Justice Roberts. No one was\nconfused.\nThis argument, it's a new argument in this\nCourt about how to read the rules, the 30 -- 52.01(d),\n51.100, and 51.166(b)(8), all uncited below. It's really\nnot plausible. The Court would have to abandon a lot of\nvery basic principles of how to interpret legal texts to\nread the rules this way, and I think Judge Poisner was\nright on that. He was right to say this is the natural\nreading of the rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is \"rate\" defined?\nI'm still troubled by 52.01(b). Where is -- you say\n\"rate\" is defined. Where?\nMR. DONAHUE: \"Rate\" is used as an annual\nrate in 51.166(b) (21) and (b)(23).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not defined. You\nsay it's just used that way.\nMR. DONAHUE: It's the only -- it's tons\nper year consistently.\nThe other thing I would point out, as the\nCourt is aware, is that 307(b) applies it bars courts in\nenforcement actions, which includes this Court. This\ncase is not up on cert from the D.C. Circuit in New\nYork.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
