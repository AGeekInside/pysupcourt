        "content": "(1:01 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis afternoon in Case 09-400, Staub v. Proctor\nHospital.\nMr. Schnapper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe dismissal of an employee is often the\nresult of the interrelated actions and decisions of\nseveral officials. Whether an employer is legally\nresponsible for any particular official and his or her\nactions and decisions turns on agency law. Congress\nlegislates against a background of agency law and is\npresumed to have intended agency principles to govern\nthat kind of question. Agency law, not the Eleventh\nCircuit's \"cat's paw\" doctrine, is the controlling\nstandard here.\nThere are two principal agency doctrines on\nwhich liability can be based.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, before we jump to\nagency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of\nthe statute?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the statute says that a\nprima facie case is made out if it is shown that\nmilitary service, anti-military animus, was a motivating\nfactor in the employer's action.\nThe employer's action here was discharge,\nright?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the word \"motivate\"\nmeans to provide someone with a motive to do something,\nright?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the person who did\nsomething here was the person who discharged, discharged\nMr. Staub, right?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, that's not the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So why doesn't it follow\nthat the motivation that's relevant under the statute is\nthe motivation of the person who -- who performs the\naction that is challenged?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, there's a -- there are\na series of actions and decisions that yield this\nresult. The reference in the statute is to the actions\nof the employer, not to any particular official. And\nso -\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but the -- what is -\nwhat is made illegal are certain employer actions,\nright? Not everything that's done, not -- just writing\nup a bad report for a biased reason is not actionable\nunder this statute; isn't that correct?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct. But a\ndecision to -- the decision to dismiss an official is -\ncan be, and is here, the result, the cumulative result,\nof a series of decisions.\nIt's not unlike what occurs in -- in the\ncriminal justice system. Only a sentencing judge can\nsend a defendant to prison, but that decision actually\nis a result of a series of other decisions, all of which\nare government action. We think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but you say\nthat those decisions that contribute have to be\ndecisions by supervisory personnel. If your theory is\ncorrect, I don't know why that is so. I don't know why\na co-employee who has a hostile motivation and makes a\nreport to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the\nindividual, why that -- that wouldn't qualify as well.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, our standard is not\nwhether it's a supervisor, but whether it's an official\nfor whom the employer is liable under agency law. That\nwould not be every supervisor. If a -- if a supervisor\nunrelated to this particular department put a false\ncharge in a -- a suggestion box, that wouldn't be any\ndifferent.\nOrdinarily, a coworker wouldn't qualify\nunder agency principles as an agent of the employer when\nengaging in that conduct. You have to look at the\nspecific conduct and apply the traditional agency\nstandards. They are laid out, for example, in the\nCourt's decision in Ellerth, which refers to the two\nbranches of agency law: scope of employment, and action\nwhich is aided in, where the actor was aided in the\nconduct by his or her official position.\nAnd I think those principles would not\nordinarily apply to a coworker, but they would also not\napply invariably to a supervisor. This isn't -- we're\nnot advocating the supervisor versus non-supervisor\ndistinction in Ellerth, but -- but a return to just the\ntraditional agency doctrines. And we think those\ndoctrines delineate who is the employer for the purpose\nof the statute, which bans action by the employer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the employer would\nbe liable for these lower supervisory employees here\nwhy? Did they have authority to discharge?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, they had other\nauthorities. They had -- well, there are two -- two\ndoctrines.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do they stand in\ndifferent shoes from a co-employee who also contributes\nto the ultimate decision to fire?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: But it's -- it's the core\nresponsibility of -- in terms of scope of employment,\nit's the core responsibility of a supervisor of a\nparticular individual to be monitoring his or her\nbehavior, reporting on it, perhaps initiating\ndisciplinary matters -- measures.\nThat wouldn't be true of all supervisors.\nIt's only true of Mr. Staub's supervisors. So -- what\n-- the kind of thing they did was the kind of work that\nthey were employed to engage in, and that distinguishes\nthem from, say, another supervisor who might slip a note\ninto a suggestion box.\nSecond, the other branch, major branch, of\nagency law is that an employer is liable for actions of\nindividuals when their conduct -- when they are aided in\ntheir conduct by their official position, which would\nnot typically be true of a fellow worker. But that\ncould be true here.\nFor example, Mulally set much of this in\nmotion when, on the plaintiff's version of the facts,\nshe issued the January 27th corrective order. Everyone\nagrees she wrote it. She signed it. She was aided in\ndoing that by her position as a supervisor. A coworker\ncouldn't do that. And indeed, somebody else's\nsupervisor couldn't have done that. So -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I just ask where -\ncould I ask where your argument leads? Let's say that\nan employer calls in an employee and says: Now, we have\nto decide who to lay off, and we've looked at your\nrecord over the last 10 years, and here it is, all the\nevaluations you've gotten over the past 10 years, and\nbased on all of that, we -- we've decided that you're\ngoing to be the person to be laid off.\nNow, if it turns out that one of those\nevaluations was rendered by someone who had an\nanti-military bias, would that make the employee -\nwould that be a prima facie case against the employer?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it would. But -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if the -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: But the affirmative -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if the employer at that\ntime did every -- made every reasonable effort to\ninvestigate the validity of all the prior evaluations,\nstill the employer would be on the hook?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. There is nothing in\nthe statute or in the common law that creates a special\nrule for thorough investigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a sweeping\nrule. I was going to ask a related hypothetical.\nSuppose the -- the officer who's in charge, charged with\nthe decision to terminate or not to terminate, says:\nI'm going to have a hearing. You can both have counsel.\nAnd you have -- who is it -- suppose Buck -- suppose the\ntwo employees that were allegedly anti-military here\ntestified, and they said there was no anti-military\nbias, and the person is then terminated.\nLater the employee has evidence that those\ntwo were lying. Could he bring an action then?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's sweeping. That's\nalmost an insurer's liability insofar as the director of\nemployment is concerned.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's respondeat -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He has to ensure -- he -\nthat he has done everything he can. He has a hearing,\nand he has almost absolute liability.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Respondeat -- respondeat\nsuperior is absolute liability. There -- there's no due\ndiligence exception. In fact, if you look to section\n219 of the Restatement of Agency, 219 part (2)(b)\nprovides for liability based on negligence, but part\n(2)(d), regardless of whether there's negligence,\nprovides liability if you're added in your -- aided in\nyour conduct by the -- by your position.\nNow, it's possible, depending on the exact\nfacts, that the situation you described wouldn't fit\ninto scope of employment or aided in. If you just had\ntwo people whose only role was just as witnesses, then\nthey're not acting as agents; they are just witnesses,\nperhaps.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: But there is no -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a defense for\nthe employer that, no matter that there was this ill\nwill, there was enough else to warrant termination of\nthis employee. And so the -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd it's the language of section 4311(c)(1) that's\ncritical here. The statute provides that if an improper\nmotive was a motivating factor, there is a defense. But\nthere's only one defense, and the defense is a showing\nthe employer would have fired the plaintiff anyway. The\nlanguage is mandatory. It says if the defense is not\nmade out, the employer shall be considered to have\nviolated the statute.\nBut the -- the clearest enunciation of the\nerror in the Seventh Circuit is the -- is the language\nat page 47 of the Joint Appendix, where the court says:\nWithout regard to the jury verdict here, the employer is\noff the hook if the decisionmaker did her own\ninvestigation. That's an additional defense.\nAnd it's simply inconsistent with the\nlanguage of the statute. Now, that may not have been -\nthat may have been harsh, but it's what the statute\nsays.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That isn't what the statute\nsays. You -- you jump over the language of the statute.\nIt has to be a motivating factor in the decision to\ndischarge. And that speaks -- that looks natural -- the\nnatural reading of that is that it looks at the\nmotivation of the person who actually makes the decision\nto discharge.\nNow, I'm not suggesting that's the right\nrule. That's a very unattractive rule. But the rule\nthat you have suggested is also a very unattractive\nrule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt.\nIs there no reasonable middle position here? It's all\nor nothing?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think that the -\nthe kind of circumstances that the Court has pointed to\nwould be relevant at the remedy stage. The remedies are\n-- are discretionary and, whereas 4311(c)(1) says\n\"shall,\" 4323 in describing all the remedies says \"may.\"\nAnd so a court could take those things into account in\nframing a remedy.\nAnd certainly the good faith efforts of\nsomeone in Buck's position, for example, would be\nrelevant to a determination whether a violation was\nwillful. And that, in fact, reflects what happened in\nthis case, which is that the jury found that there was a\nviolation -- found that the -- the motivations involved\nhere included an improper motivation, rejected the\n4311(c)(1) defense, but then found the violation wasn't\nwillful.\nSo I think, given the structure of the\nstatute, the -- the play here, the ability to adjust to\nthose circumstances, is in the remedy provision, not in\nthe mandatory language of the 4311(c)(1).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that -- isn't the\nGovernment's formulation that the discrimination has to\nplay a substantial role in the termination a limiting\nprinciple? I mean, you answered or appeared to be\nanswering Justice Alito that in a 10-year history, if\none report of discrimination existed, that that would\nshift the burden to the employer.\nIs that an accurate statement of law? That\none report has to play a role that's more than a mere\nexistence, doesn't it?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, in that regard, I\nthink we would articulate the standard differently.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Than the SG?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. The language in the\nstatute is not \"a substantial motivating factor.\" It's\n\"a motivating factor.\" And that choice of language is\nclearly deliberate. This whole -- this language in this\nprovision derives from this Court's decision in Price\nWaterhouse, a very -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it has to have some\nmateriality to -- to the decision. I mean, it has to\nhave -- it has to play not just any role. It has to\nplay a material role in the decision, no? Or -- they\nuse \"substantial.\" It could be \"material.\" It could\nbe -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: If I could go back to Price\nWaterhouse and explain how we got to this language. It\nwas a sharply divided opinion. The plurality standard\nof Justice Brennan said \"a motivating factor.\" Justice\nWhite's standard would have -- was \"a substantially\nmotivating factor.\" Justice O'Connor's standard was\n\"substantial.\" Justice Kennedy pointed out in his\ndissenting opinion that was going to lead to fights\nabout how much was enough to be substantial.\nWhen Congress then wrote the 1991 Civil\nRights Act, from which this language derives, amending\nTitle VII, they used the Brennan language, \"a motivating\nfactor.\" They didn't use \"substantial,\" and I think\nthat was clearly deliberate. Everybody -- anyone who\nread Price Waterhouse -- and that provision was written\nabout Price Waterhouse -- would have understood that\nthat was a difference within the Court, and they made\nthat choice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schnapper, I guess this\ngoes back to Justice Alito's question. I find it\ndifficult to grasp the distinction that you draw or what\nit seems that could possibly exist between a willful\nmotivating factor and a non-willful motivating factor.\nI mean, to say that it's motivating is -- is to say that\nit's willful, it seems to me. But you want us to draw a\ndistinction between a willful motivating factor and a\nnon-willful motivating factor.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's not our position,\nJustice Scalia. Our position is that, with regard to\nthe liability determination in 4311, that any motivating\nfactor is what's required. And if you have a number of\ndifferent officials involved, Buck and Mulally and\nKorenchuk, if anyone of -- if anyone who played a role\nin this had an unlawful motive, that satisfies\n4311(c)(1), and the burden shifts to the employer to\nshow it would have done the same thing anyway.\nWillfulness doesn't have that same language\nabout a motivating factor. It just asks whether the\nemployer's violation was willful. This Court's decision\nabout willfulness in Thurston and Hazen Paper I think\nare broad enough to encompass a situation where you had\nseveral different officials. And if I might -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want to hold the\n-- the employer liable for the actions of these other\nofficials, other than the one who did the firing. And\nif they are liable for -- if you hold them -- the\nemployer liable for their contribution to the filing, it\nseems to me you have to hold him liable for their\nwillfulness as well.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's our view that the\nlanguage of the statute permits that distinction because\nof the discretionary nature of the remedy provision as\nopposed to the mandatory nature of 4311(c)(1).\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSchnapper.\nMr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS\nAMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn employer is liable under USERRA when a\nsupervisor acting with a discriminatory motive uses a\ndelegated authority to cause an adverse employment\naction. The court of appeals held that liability does\nnot attach unless that supervisor exerts singular\ninfluence over the decisionmaker. But that standard is\ninconsistent with the statute for two reasons. First,\nit's incompatible with the statutory definition of\n\"employer,\" which includes not just the ultimate\ndecisionmaker, but any person to whom the employer has\ndelegated the performance of significant employment\nresponsibilities.\nSecond, it's contrary to the statute's\ncausation standard, which requires only that military\nstatus be a motivating factor, not necessarily a\nsingularly important factor or the determinative factor\nin the adverse employment action. Now -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you regard -- is\nthat the same as a but-for cause, the motivating factor?\nMR. MILLER: No. There's two separate\ncomponents to the inquiry. First -- the first is that\nit has to be a motivating factor, and that's the\nplaintiff's burden to establish in order to make a prima\nfacie case under section 4311(c). And then there is an\naffirmative defense if the employer can show that it was\nnot a but-for factor in the sense that, you know, even\nhad the person not been in the military, the same action\nwould have been taken. That's the -- if the employer\ncan show that, then it's absolved of liability.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you using proximate\ncause in but-for, or are you suggesting a different\nformulation of causation?\nMR. MILLER: In our view, the \"motivating\nfactor\" language captures the idea of proximate cause.\nSomething can be a motivating factor if it is one of\nmany factors, but, in our view, it does need to be more\nthan a trivial or de minimis factor, and if you have a\nsituation where the bias -- the action of the biased\nsupervisor leads through a long and improbable and\nunforeseeable chain of causation to the adverse\nemployment action, you might have a but-for cause, but\nyou wouldn't have proximate cause, and it wouldn't be a\nmotivating factor.\nNow, this case, and I think most real-world\ncases, are quite different from that. Here we have a\ntermination decision, and that was made by Buck on the\nbasis of the January 27th warning that was given to\nPetitioner and the report that Petitioner had not\ncomplied with that warning. And both parts of that, the\nwarning issued by Mulally and the report of\nnoncompliance that came from Korenchuk, both parts of\nthat the jury could have concluded were in -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In that formulation as\nyou've just articulated, where do you place your test of\na subordinate setting in motion and playing a\nsubstantial role? What is that test that you proposed\nin your brief -- how does it fit into this?\nMR. MILLER: The -- the discriminatorily\nmotivated actions in this case, on the evidence\ninterpreted in the light most favorable to Petitioner,\nwere the decision of Mulally to write up Petitioner for\nthis January 27th incident, and that was motivated by\nher hostility to him because of his status in the Army\nReserves; and then the decision of Korenchuk to report\nthat he had violated the terms of that January 27th\nwarning, and that was also motivated by his hostility to\nPetitioner's membership in the -- in the Army Reserves.\nAnd both of those decisions had a substantial causal\nrole in the -- in the ultimate decision made by the\nemployer to terminate. And, because both of those\npeople, Mulally and Korenchuk -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your -- Petitioner's\ncounsel argues that there is no issue of -- in the\nmotivating factor test, it doesn't have to be a\nsubstantial role; it just has to be a motivating factor,\nso that the subordinates -\nMR. MILLER: Well, this may just be a\nsemantic disagreement. We don't think it has to be\nsubstantial in the sense of predominant. It can be one\nof -- there can be many factors, and as long as it's one\nof them, that's a motivating factor. But it needs to be\nsubstantial in the sense of more than de minimis or more\nthan trivial, something that the employer actually took\ninto account as one of the reasons -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What happens in the\nsituation where a prior evaluation or some disciplinary\naction does have a substantial effect on the decision\nthat's -- the employment decision that's made, but the\nemployer has no notice that the prior evaluation or\ndisciplinary action was based on a biased ground, or any\nreasonable way of finding out that it was based on a\nbiased ground? What happens in that situation?\nMR. MILLER: There would still be liability\njust as there is liability in the situation, which is\nquite common, where an employer gives a single official\nthe authority to both observe an employee's behavior and\nmake a decision to terminate. If that single official\nis biased and makes a decision on the basis of that\nbias, then the employer is going to be liable even if\nthe people who hired that official tried very hard to\nmake sure that he wasn't biased. And that's consistent\nwith -\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you get around the\nstatutory language that says that the motivating -- it\nhas to be a motivating factor in the -- in the action\nthat is challenged?\nMR. MILLER: It -- it has to be a\nmotivating -- the statute says a motivating factor in\nthe employer's action.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the employer's action\nhere is -- is discharge.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, and the employer -- when\nit's -- the employer is a corporation, and it's -- so\nyou have to look at which individuals do you look at in\nfiguring out whether it was a motivating factor or not,\nand the statute tells us that. In the definition of\n\"employer\" in section 4303, it says that the employer\nincludes everyone who has been delegated the performance\nof employment-related responsibilities.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but those other\npeople -- everybody who has been delegated authority\nunder the -- by the employer are not -- is not involved\nin the action that is challenged.\nMR. MILLER: They -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does not take the action\nthat is challenged.\nMR. MILLER: They are not the last person\nwho signs the piece of paper, but they certainly are\npart of the employer's decision.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So maybe then the test is\nwhether they were delegated some of the responsibility\nfor the challenged action. Were they delegated\nresponsibility for making the discharge decision?\nMR. MILLER: They -- they were delegated\nsupervisory responsibility by the -- by the employer,\nthe authority to observe the people under their\nsupervision, to evaluate and report on their\nperformance, the authority to initiate disciplinary\nproceedings. And they used that authority in a\ndiscriminatory manner, and that, that conduct by them,\nwas a substantial causal factor in the -- in the\nultimate action of discharge. And given the -- the\nstatutory definition of employer and the motivating\nfactor causation standard, that's enough under the\nstatute for -- for liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a\nsituation where a particular procedure such as the one\nhere is set up for a discriminatory reason, and the\nemployee is really upset with that, and so he, you know,\nstarts a fire in the plant? Wouldn't have had -\nwouldn't have set the fire if not for the discriminatory\npurpose. Now, does he have a cause of action in that\ncase when he's fired for setting -- setting the office\non fire?\nMR. MILLER: No, even though, as you say, in\na sense there would be but-for causation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't have\nhappened -- yes.\nMR. MILLER: But it is not -- it's not under\nany standard of proximate causation, and not a -- the\ninitial discriminatory discipline or warning would not\nbe a motivating or substantial factor in the ultimate\ndecision to fire him. He is being fired because of the\nintervening cause that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you do accept\nthat the traditional doctrine of an intervening cause is\napplicable in this?\nMR. MILLER: Some independent intervening\ncause. Now, in this case, we don't have anything like\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what -\nwhat independent intervening cause -\nMR. MILLER: Independent of the employer.\nIn this case, we have a number of people, all of whom\nare agents of the same employer. So, under traditional\nprinciples of -- of an intervening cause, one can't say\nthat any one of those agents of the employer was an\nintervening cause that broke the chain of causation from\nmisconduct of the other agent of the employer. You have\na series of agents of the same employer engaging in a\ncourse of conduct that at the beginning of which is an\nunlawfully -- unlawful discriminatory motive that leads\nto the termination.\nThat's quite different from the employee\ndeciding to start a fire or engage in some sort of\nmisconduct that has nothing to do with his military\nstatus.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- I'm --\nI'm sorry, but I think the end there just kind of glided\nover the whole issue. You say it had nothing to do with\nhis military status. It has to do with a procedure that\nwas set up because the employer was discriminating\nagainst him because of his military status. So it\ncertainly had something to do with his military status.\nMR. MILLER: It is not, I think, a -- one\nwould hope it is not a foreseeable result of discipline\ngiven to an employee that he would then start a fire.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but\nthe hypothetical is extreme to try to flesh out your\nposition. You can certainly imagine an employee\nreacting in a particular way by being put through\nprocedures that were set up in a discriminatory manner\nthat would seem to anybody to be a basis for\ntermination, even though the groundwork was laid by the\ndiscriminatory procedure.\nMR. MILLER: I think one would not normally\nthink that, even if it's less extreme than starting a\nfire, that a course of misconduct by the employee is a\nforeseeable result of a discriminatory -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't it -- wouldn't\nthe employer's defense simply be: Anyone who starts a\nfire goes. That's -- that's a -- it would have happened\nno matter what the reason was for doing that.\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that just comes\nunder the employer's defense as showing that the same\naction would have been taken.\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Davis.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY G. DAVIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe parties to this case are in total\nagreement with respect to two points. The first point\nis that Linda Buck made the decision to fire Vincent\nStaub. And the second point is there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that Linda Buck possessed animus toward Mr.\nStaub on account of his service in the Reserve.\nApplying ordinary tort-related vicarious\nliability rules, Staub's case against Proctor Hospital\nwould end right here. But the Seventh Circuit, applying\nwhat it calls the \"cat's paw\" doctrine, gives Staub and\nall other plaintiffs like him a second bite at the\napple.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's look at the\nhypothetical. Take it out of the facts of this case.\nThere are two supervisors, each of them have\nanti-military animus, and they both report that this\ngentleman was late when he wasn't.\nMR. DAVIS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's absolutely a\nfalsehood. They go in, they report it to Miss Buck.\nMiss Buck does an investigation. There are no\nwitnesses. There's no one else to prove that they came\nin late. She just takes the supervisors' word. She\nlooks at their report -- it was moments after the\nemployee didn't show up -- and she says: He's a\nlate-goer. I don't know anything about anti-animus; I\nsimply fired him because two supervisors who are\ntrustworthy -- I've looked at their files, they've never\nlied about anything before, they are pretty honest\npeople and -- what happens in that situation?\nMR. DAVIS: I think in that situation,\nconsistent with the \"cat's paw\" analysis, with the facts\nthat you set up, the two supervisors so dominated her\ndecision that there would be likely a finding that the\ncase goes to the jury.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How? She went and\nlooked for witnesses, didn't find them. She looked at\ntheir records. She did what happened here; other people\nhave complained about these people, don't particularly\nlike them.\nMR. DAVIS: But there being no other input\nwhatsoever beyond that, there still is the domination\nissue. If I change your-- your hypothetical just a\nlittle bit and say that all of what you said is true,\nbut in addition to that the fellow who got fired has a\n10-year history of being late, and she looked at that\nhistory, I think that she's now made an independent\ndecision, which is what happened in this case. And,\ntherefore, under the Seventh Circuit's rule, no\nliability attaches, and that's the right result.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's the\nquestion, because you just added a very important fact,\nwhich is a 10-year history of being late. But on this\nday, he wasn't late. On this day, the two supervisors\nmade it up.\nMR. DAVIS: And -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would she have fired him\nabsent that report? Isn't that what the jury has to\ndecide?\nMR. DAVIS: I think that is what the jury\nhas to decide, but I'm not sure that case in the latter\nextended hypothetical gets that far.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what the -- what\nthis circuit's \"cat's paw\" theory does and what others\ndo say, if she engaged in any investigation, there's no\nliability.\nMR. DAVIS: I -- I disagree with that a\nlittle bit. I don't think if she engaged in any\ninvestigation, that absolves of liability. I think if\nshe engages in a good faith investigation, it absolves\nof liability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was it -- what was\nit here? Because the -- when -- what was his name --\nKorenchuk -\nMR. DAVIS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- takes him into Buck's\noffice, and Buck hands him the pink slip and says,\n\"You're fired,\" that the jury could have credited that\nevidence. He was given no opportunity to explain the\nsituation. What kind of investigation? What -- she\nlooked at his personnel file. What else was the\ninvestigation?\nMR. DAVIS: I will answer that. Before I\nget to that, I disagree with the point about he wasn't\ngiven an opportunity to explain. I think the record is\nclear he was given an opportunity to explain.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When?\nMR. DAVIS: At the -- two times. At the\ntime he was discharged, on the day that Korenchuk brings\nhim in, Korenchuk says: \"I was looking for you and\ncouldn't find you.\" And in the record, in fact, Staub\ngave an explanation of his whereabouts. Buck was there.\nShe heard it.\nThe second time is, approximately 5 days\nlater, he files a five-page-long grievance stating\nall -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is after he got his\npink slip. What -- what point -- when Korenchuk takes\nhim into -- takes Staub into Buck's office, according to\nhis testimony, which the jury could credit, he wasn't\nasked a thing. She just said: Here's your pink slip;\nyou're fired.\nMR. DAVIS: I think the record shows he did\ngive an explanation of his whereabouts. The record also\nshows that he filed a five-page grievance contesting\nthat action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: After he was fired.\nMR. DAVIS: After he was fired. And that\nBuck carefully investigated that, and, 5 days after it\nwas filed, gave him a letter saying: I have looked into\nit, I have considered all your arguments, including your\nargument that you were discharged on account of your\nmilitary service, but I don't credit it. And,\ntherefore, I'm sustaining the discharge.\nAnd that is absolutely -- Mr. Staub knew\nthat that works for him, because in 1998 he invoked the\nsame procedure when he was discharged the first time for\nsimilar reasons, and he was conditionally reinstated to\nemployment at Proctor Hospital.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did I understand\nyou to say that you do agree with the Seventh Circuit's\n\"cat's paw\" approach to this?\nMR. DAVIS: I do agree with it. The \"cat's\npaw\" approach essentially gives Mr. Staub and others\nlike him a second bite at the apple. But he has to\ndemonstrate that the person who possessed animus\nexercised so much control over the decisionmaker that\nthat person became the true decisionmaker. And that\nsimply doesn't work in this case for a number of\nreasons.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you -\nhow is that consistent with the statutory language that\nrequires that this discrimination simply be a motivating\nfactor?\nMR. DAVIS: The answer to that is the\nstatute sets forth five factors, four or five factors,\nand says that one of the four or five employment actions\nhas to be a motivating factor in arriving at the\ndecision. So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- let's look at\nthe statutory factors.\nMR. DAVIS: Okay. It's 4311(a). And it\nsays -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, and where -- where\nare you reading it from?\nMR. DAVIS: From the third line -- well, I'm\nsorry, I can't tell you what line it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Page 3 of the blue brief.\nMR. DAVIS: It says that there are five\nactions that are prohibited: denial of initial\nemployment, reemployment, retention in employment,\npromotion, or any benefit of employment.\nAnd it says that an employer cannot take\naction, one of those actions, on the basis of four\nfactors: membership, application for membership,\nperformance, service -- or service of obligation in the\nuniformed services.\nSo there has to be something to connect one\nof those factors to one of those five actions. And\nthat's the literal meaning of the statute. And I think\nthe Seventh Circuit's view is absolutely consistent with\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry.\nThe statute says is a motivating -- one of those four\nthings, membership, application, et cetera, is a\nmotivating factor in the action.\nMR. DAVIS: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I understood\nyour position to be that the supervisor has to have such\ndominant control that it's the \"cat's paw.\"\nMR. DAVIS: That -- that -- the\nsubordinate's.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. DAVIS: -- motivation is imputed\nactually to the decisionmaker, and ultimately to the\nemployer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess where\nI'm having trouble following you is the total domination\nmotivating factor. It seems like a much more stringent\ntest that the Seventh Circuit has adopted.\nMR. DAVIS: Well, I think in the context of\nthis case, Your Honor, it's not, because the definition\nof \"employer\" here not only includes Proctor Hospital,\nwhat you might call the ultimate employer, but it also\nincludes the person who made the adverse employment\ndecision. And in this case, it's Linda Buck.\nAnd this statute creates personal liability\nfor Ms. Buck or anybody else who makes a decision if\nit's based on one of these factors contained in the\nstatute. I don't think there's any way a jury would be\nallowed to consider whether or not Ms. Buck is in\nviolation of the statute, because there's an absolute\ndearth of evidence that any of these factors motivated\nthe decision she made.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that assumes that\nthe employment decision is solely hers. It's hers, not\nbased on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on\ninformation that she has gathered.\nMR. DAVIS: I agree. It is hers to the\nextent that she makes a good faith investigation into\nthe background facts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but she's not\nacting in a vacuum. She's acting on information that\nhas been supplied to her by people who are authorized to\nsupply that to her in the employment context.\nMR. DAVIS: And -- and in this case, she's\nacting on an awful lot of information. They pick out -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're now talking past\nthe individual case.\nMR. DAVIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am talking about just\nthe legal analysis, which is: She's a decisionmaker,\nbut there are multiple actors on behalf of the employer.\nThat's your adversary's position -\nMR. DAVIS: I agree with that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or participating in the\nprocess.\nAnd they're saying if any of those actors in\nthe process has been delegated employment duties that\npermit them to participate in this way, then if what\nmotivates them is bias of this kind, then the employer\nis responsible, not just for Ms. Buck's activities, but\nfor the two supervisors' discriminatory activities.\nMR. DAVIS: That would lead to a\nnever-ending chain of looking backwards all the time\nover the course of perhaps a very long employment\nhistory to scour the record to determine is there one\nsingle or two single actions out there that may somehow\nhave come forward and caused this termination?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in most\nsituations, an employer comes in and says: I fired X\nfor X, Y, and Z reasons. And if they don't mention one\nof those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why\nwould a court rely on it at all? It's not a motivating\nfactor.\nMR. DAVIS: I'm not sure I thoroughly\nunderstand the hypothetical, but if the true\ndecisionmaker there comes forward and says, I didn't\nknow about this, I didn't rely upon it -- I don't think\nthat the animus can be imputed to the decisionmaker.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is this so complicated?\nI'm probably missing something.\nMR. DAVIS: I don't think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the thing -- but it\ndoesn't help you, I don't think, if it isn't\ncomplicated.\nMR. DAVIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the -- because of\nBurlington, we're only talking about a certain number of\nemployees who could make an employer responsible.\nMR. DAVIS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. So those are\nsupervisory people, we'll call them.\nMR. DAVIS: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why don't\nwe just stop there and just say we have a statute, the\nstatute says that if -- if a bad motive was a\nmotivating -- had to be a motivating factor,\ndiscriminatory -- a discriminatory motivating factor in\nthe dismissal, then, unless you can prove an affirmative\ndefense, you lose.\nWhy do we have to have something special if\none of these small group of employees happens to be the\nperson who said the last words or happens to be somebody\nwho told somebody who said the last words or happens to\nbe somebody who told the somebody the\nsomething-or-other? You're just looking for one thing.\nAnd there could be five zillion fact situations.\nSo why something special? Why did the\nSeventh Circuit say where it's not the guy who said the\nlast words, you have to show, quote, \"singular\ninfluence\"? Why singular influence? Why not just what\nthe statute says -\nMR. DAVIS: I think that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that it was -- that it\nled to the -- what she said, led to the discriminatory\nmotive being a motivating factor, period, end of the\nmatter. No special \"cat's paw\" rule, no special\nanything rule.\nMR. DAVIS: No consideration of proximate\ncause, either.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. Of course, you\nhave to show proximate cause. You have to show cause.\nYou always do. I'm just saying, why have a special\nrule? Why not have a special rule if somebody was on\nthe second floor? You wouldn't think of that. So if\nyou're not going to do it because the person's on the\nsecond floor, why do it because they happen to be\nsomebody who told somebody, rather than somebody who was\nthe person who was told?\nMR. DAVIS: Because to motivate -- to be\nmotivated by one of these factors, there has to be some\nelement of proximate causation -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, fine. You're\nperfectly entitled to say that. But what I don't see\nthat you're entitled to say are the words that the\nSeventh Circuit used, which is: You have to show jury\nthat there was sufficient evidence to support a finding\nof singular influence.\nMR. DAVIS: I think that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't just sound\nlike it was a motivating cause. That sounds like it was\nsomething really special.\nMR. DAVIS: I -- I think that that is the\nSeventh Circuit's way of saying proximate cause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, okay. So why don't we\nsay: Seventh Circuit, if that's your way of saying it\nis just a normal thing like cause, we accept that, but\nplease don't use those words. And because you might\nhave used -- you might have used them meaning something\nelse, we will send this back so we're certain that what\nyou are doing is applying the same test to everything.\nIn other words, was it a motivating factor?\nMR. DAVIS: I think you could say that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then your -\nthat seems like a good resolution of this case to me. I\ndon't know if it does to them.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think that\nyou've misread -- I think that you've misread the \"cat's\npaw\" principle of the court of appeals. I don't think\nthat it is, to them, a determination of proximate cause\nat all.\nAs I understand their opinion, they say that\nthe statute requires that the -- let me get the right\nlanguage here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited\ndiscriminatory factor must have been a motivating factor\nin the employer's action. And they say that means it\nmust have motivated the person who took the employer's\naction.\nIt's not a motivating factor in the\nemployer's action unless the person who took the action\non behalf of the employer had that as its motive.\nThen the court of appeals makes an\nexception: However, if the person who appears to be\ntaking the action on behalf of the employer is really\nnot the person who took the action, but was totally\nunder the control of a subordinate who -- and the person\njust swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we\nwill hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person\nwho signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't\nhave the motive, if in fact the decision was effectively\nthe decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the\nemployer.\nIt has nothing to do with proximate cause.\nIt has to do with the text that it has to be a\nmotivating factor in the employer's action; not a\nmotivating factor somewhere down the line, but in the\nemployer's action. That's how I read the court of\nappeals' opinion.\nMR. DAVIS: And I agree with that, and we\nget back to the notion that, in this case, it was\nMs. Buck who made the decision. She made the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -\nMR. DAVIS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mrs. Buck never would\nhave made this decision if Korenchuk hadn't come in and\nsaid: Here's Staub, he's goofing off; he was told to\ntell me when he was going to be absent, and he didn't.\nKorenchuk, who has the animus, is a\nmotivating factor certainly in what happened to Mr.\nStaub, because if you didn't have Mr. Korenchuk marching\nStaub into Buck's office he would have retained his job.\nWasn't his last -- his most recent performance rating\nvery good?\nMR. DAVIS: Only on one respect. He\nreceived a technical \"very good,\" but with respect to\nthe narrative portion of that evaluation, it says: I\nwant you to stay in the department when you're being\npaid to work, and not to be out wandering around.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In any case, there was no\nindication, apart from Korenchuk's coming in, that Buck\nwould have taken any adverse action against Staub.\nMR. DAVIS: I don't think we know the answer\nto that. It was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's not the\npoint. It seems to me you have to -- we're not going to\nsecond-guess the jury determination here.\nI understood your point to be that there's a\ndifference between a motivating factor in the decision,\nwhich means the person who made the decision on behalf\nof the employer must have had that motive and, on the\nother hand, a factor which was relevant to the decision,\nor a factor which influenced the decision. That's quite\ndifferent from a motivating factor in the decision.\nYou -- you have to get us to believe -- and\nI'm not sure we will -- that \"motivating factor in the\ndecision\" refers to motive on the part of the person who\nmade the decision. That's -- that's essentially your\npoint, isn't it?\nMR. DAVIS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you can't agree\nwith me, because my question was why would that be? You\nhave two people, A and B; they are both supervisors. In\nthe one case, B fires the employee because he's in the\nArmy, and he says it: Ha, ha, that's why I'm doing it.\nIn the second case, he fires the employee\nbecause he thought the employee was -- in one of Justice\nSotomayor's hypotheticals or anyone else, he fires him\nfor a perfectly good reason, but A has lied about it.\nAnd the reason A lied about it was because she wanted to\ntell him a lie so B would fire the employee, and her\nreason is because he's in the Army.\nThose two situations -- the second seems to\nme one of 80 -- 80 million situations, fact-related,\nthat could arise, and I don't know why we want a special\nstandard for such a situation. Why not just ask the\noverall question: Was this action an action that was -\nin which the bad motive was a motivating factor? Forget\npsychoanalysis of A; B is good enough; or vice versa.\nThat was my question.\nMR. DAVIS: And in B, the employer could not\nbe liable. In B, the person who made the decision, the\nemployer, was not motivated by one of the factors in the\nstatute; that person couldn't be liable. If that person\ncan't be liable, how can that employer of that person be\nvicariously liable? I don't think they can.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because together they\ndismissed the employee.\nMR. DAVIS: Oh, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: One by supplying the false\nstatement, the other by acting on it.\nMR. DAVIS: I disagree with that. A\ncorporation can only act through its agents.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are both agents.\nThat's why I made them both Burlington people. I wanted\nto get them in the group. They both have the same\nBurlington status, so we get that issue out of it. And\ntogether they fire this individual. In the absence of\neither the one or the other, he wouldn't have been\nfired.\nMR. DAVIS: I've listened to the\nhypothetical long enough that I've lost track of who\nmade the decision to fire him.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I feel I'm going to get\nnowhere pursuing this hypothetical further. So I will\ndrop it and say -\nMR. DAVIS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- answer it as you wish or\nas you understand it.\nMR. DAVIS: As I understand it, the second\nperson in the hypothetical had no motivation whatsoever\nunder the statute to cause the discharge, and,\ntherefore, the employer wouldn't be liable for that\ndecision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, your position is -\nand it coincides with the Seventh Circuit, but it is in\nopposition to the Secretary of Labor's commentary on how\nthis works. The Secretary of Labor's commentary is it's\na motivating factor. And if Korenchuk precipitates this\nwhole thing, that's a motivating factor.\nDo we -- I mean, this is -- the Secretary of\nLabor administers the statute. Do we give any weight to\nthe government's official position on what a motivating\nfactor means?\nMR. DAVIS: Normally, you would give weight\nto the government's position, but I think the\ngovernment's position has to be consistent with the\nprecise language of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does the Secretary of\nLabor administer this statute? What are -- what are his\nor her responsibilities under the statute?\nMR. DAVIS: There can be a charge filed with\nthe Secretary of Labor, which the Secretary of Labor\nwould then investigate. The Secretary of Labor has the\noption to bring an action, should the Secretary choose\nto do so. But, coterminously, the individual service\nperson can bring an independent cause of action, and\nthat's what happened in this case. In this case, there\nwas no Secretary of Labor involvement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't this just\ngoverned by the standard principles of tort for\nconcurrent actors? Actor A was not negligent; actor B\nwas; they both contributed to the accident. And we look\nto the Restatement of Torts, which is whether or not the\nwrongful actor made a significant contribution. That's\n-- that's the end of it.\nMR. DAVIS: I think that the problem with\nthis situation is, is that one of the actors here, the\ndecision that she made, being Mulally, and that's with\nrespect to whom the most evidence of animus was adduced,\ndidn't commit an action that would be actionable under\nUSERRA. There -- there's no way that issuing the\nconstructive advice record on January 27th violated the\nstatute, even if it was motivated by animus.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we're -- but we're\ntalking about the test. And the test I gave you is\nquite different from the \"cat's paw\" test. And if you\nuse the test something along the lines that I\nformulated -- I don't know if that's precisely what the\nRestatement says -\nMR. DAVIS: Sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but to that general\neffect, the instruction given to the jury was really\noverprotective of your client, under the standard\nconcurrent -- concurrent causation analysis.\nMR. DAVIS: The instruction may have been\nsomewhat protective, but the problem is, prior to\nissuing that instruction, the district court did no\nanalysis whatsoever to determine if the instruction was\nwarranted in the first place.\nAnd that was simply our point to the Seventh\nCircuit. Before you allow this to fall into the lap of\na jury and try and explain to a jury, as opposed to the\nSupreme Court, what it means to be a \"cat's paw\" in the\nagency theory, the district court should at least make\nan initial determination that that's what we have here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can I turn to the\nSecretary of Labor's regulations? Are what we talking\nabout anything more than the following statement in his\ncommentary accompanying the final regs, namely that an\nemployee, quote, \"need not show that his or her\nprotected activities or status was the sole cause of the\nemployment action. The person's activities or status\nneed be only one of the factors that a truthful employer\nwould list if asked for the reasons for its decision.\"\nIs that -- is that the only -\nMR. DAVIS: I believe that is the only thing\nwith -- there may be a section later on, Your Honor, in\nthe regs that deals with the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is the one that\nthe Government refers to.\nMR. DAVIS: That's certainly the commentary\nthat goes with it. I agree with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me to\nbe so damning of your case. I think if this employer\nhad been asked the reasons for its decision, it would\nhave given Ms. Buck's reasons.\nMR. DAVIS: Ms. Buck would have said: I let\nhim go because he has this veritable tsunami of bad\nbehaviors. What he is accused of is absolutely\nconsistent with it. And I made the decision.\nIs it a truthful statement by her? It is\nabsolutely a truthful statement by her, and that was the\nreason for her actions.\nI think Ms. Buck's consideration of the\ndischarge decision wasn't limited to one source. It\nclearly was not. No one shaped or directed the scope of\nher determination. Even more important, she gave Mr.\nStaub the opportunity to tell his side of the story.\nAnd after considering all of that, she decided that his\ndischarge was warranted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- could a jury\nfind from the testimony before -- before it, that at the\ntime he received his pink slip -- let's not talk about\nthe grievance after -\nMR. DAVIS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at the time he got the\ngrievance slip, he was not given any opportunity to\nexplain that this charge was not warranted, that he had\ntried to reach Korenchuk on the phone to tell him:\nWe're going to lunch and was unable to. He did not have\nan opportunity to say that to Ms. Buck.\nMR. DAVIS: Again, Your Honor, I believe the\nrecord says -- and I apologize, I can't quote it from\nthe page -- that in fact Mr. Staub protested that what\nhe was accused of, i.e., not being where he was supposed\nto be, was wrong. And he stated his version of it.\nIf there are no other questions, Your Honor,\nI would respectfully request that the decision of the\nSeventh Circuit be affirmed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Davis.\nMr. Schnapper, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, is that\nyour recollection of this record, too, that -- that he\nwas -- he did state his version before he got the pink\nslip?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think it's -- it's\nsomewhat unclear what happened. It's complicated by the\nfact that the defendant's account of why he was fired\nhas changed. One -- the written explanation was that he\nnever obeyed the rule for the 3 months it was in effect.\nThe explanation given by Buck was that she had been told\nthat he wasn't -- couldn't have been found on the 19th.\nThe -- the story that was given to Staub at the time was\nthat Korenchuk couldn't find him on the 20th, so if he\nwas responding to that, he was responding to the wrong\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think anybody\nthought that Buck would have fired him just for that one\nabsence. That -- that was the trigger. But it was the\ntrigger that followed a long series of prior absences\nfor which he had been disciplined before.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: With all due -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see any\ninconsistency between those two versions.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: But those aren't the\nversions in the record -- the written record at the\ntime. The written record at the time says he's fired\nbecause he has been breaking this rule ever since\nJanuary. Nobody claims that's true.\nIf I -- we don't -- a number of questions.\nI think particularly Justice Alito asked whether\nCongress would have intended the result in this case.\nWe don't think it's as harsh as you do, but we think\nthat the intent is particularly clear here. Section\n4301(1) says that the purpose of the -- and this is the\ncodified purpose -- the purpose of the statute is to\nminimize the disadvantages to civilian careers that can\nresult from service in the military. And -- and that,\nit seems to me, you have to read -- you have to read the\nrest of the statute.\nSecondly, this -- USERRA is unique among\nemployment statutes or close to it, because the employer\nhas an economic incentive to break the law. It's\nexpensive to keep reservists on the book. And Mulally\nand Korenchuk objected to Staub working there precisely\nbecause it cost them more money when he went to drill,\nand it cost them more money when he was called up for\noperation Iraqi Freedom.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think that the\nstandard for employer liability is different under this\nstatute than under other Federal antidiscrimination\nstatutes? Is that what you're - you were just\nsuggesting?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think there are\nparticularly compelling textual reasons for the position\nwe're urging here. Other statutes have different\nlanguage. I'm not trying to address those -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So that if we -- if we hold\nhere that -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: You might decide this\ncase -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we were to hold here that\nthe \"cat's paw\" theory doesn't apply under this statute,\nthe Seventh Circuit and other circuits could continue to\napply the \"cat's paw\" theory under Title VII or under\nthe ADEA or under the ADA?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, we think that would be\nwrong for some of the reasons we've set out in our\nbrief, but -- but you could write an opinion that only\naddressed it under USERRA and left those other questions\nopen. The -- and -- but the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would Title VII be\ndifferent?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- the language\nthat -- the language in Title VII is similar to\n4311(c)(1), but the language that I just read about the\npurpose isn't in Title VII. So if some -- you could\ndecide this case on somewhat narrower grounds and not\nreach every situation.\nThe -- the interpretation of USERRA\nadopted by the Seventh Circuit creates a serious\nloophole in the statute. As a number of the amici have\npointed out, amici on the other side, employers\ntypically make a disciplinary decision as a result of a\nbunch of different decisions.\nThe Seventh Circuit holds that so long as\nthe employer divides up those responsibilities, USERRA\nwill not apply to many of the decisions. On their view,\nUSERRA applies only to what the last decisionmaker did.\nAnd the narrower her role, the narrower the protections\nof the statute.\nThis statute should not be read in that way,\nnot only because of the language that I've recounted,\nbut because USERRA, it's reemployment rights, and it's\nantidiscrimination rights play an essential role in the\nnational defense. They safeguard the livelihood of men\nand women who safeguard the nation. And Congress would\nhave wanted that statute read broadly.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
