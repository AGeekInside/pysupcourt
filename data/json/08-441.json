        "content": "(10:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument this morning in Case 08-441, Gross v. FBL\nFinancial Services.\nMr. Schnapper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals erred in holding that\nthe plaintiff had to have direct evidence in order to\nobtain the specific instruction at issue in this case.\nThis Court's decision in Desert Palace makes\ntwo important points that are relevant today. First,\nthe Court noted that this Court had at no time imposed a\ndirect evidence requirement without an affirmative\ndirective from Congress to do so. Secondly, the Court\nnoted that Congress, when it wished to impose heightened\nstandards, had done --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That -- that\nstatement may be wrong depending upon how you read Price\nWaterhouse, might it not? The first statement, that\nwe've never imposed such a requirement. I mean, if you\nthink Justice O'Connor's opinion was the determinative\nopinion in Price Waterhouse, then -- then we had.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That -- that's true, Your\nHonor. That was not the view of the Court in Desert\nPalace. Desert Palace may have misspoken in that\nregard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was dictum. They may\nhave been wrong.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, we -- we'd like to\nthink they are right. I mean, we think they are right.\nBut of course, as you say, that is, in a sense, one of\nthe questions before us.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- I just want\n-- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden of\nproof-shifting requirement absent a directive from\nCongress? Are you --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or maybe -- maybe I\nmisheard.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I may have misspoken,\nYour Honor. What the Court said was that this Court had\nnever imposed a direct evidence requirement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- in the absence of an\naffirmative directive from Congress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is some\ndisagreement among the parties, of course, what \"direct\nevidence\" means, whether it means direct as opposed to\ncircumstantial, or direct in the terms that for example\nJudge Collatin put it in the decision below.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, there is not a\ndifference between the parties. We take no position on\nthat. There is a considerable variety of views about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are telling\nus we never required direct evidence, but you are not\ntaking a position on what direct evidence is?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you may be\nright or you may be wrong. But we kind of have to know\nwhat we're dealing with.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, the Court hasn't put\nthose two things together in the way you did. I think\nthat's fair. The Court's statement in Desert Palace\ndidn't define direct evidence. It's not -- it's not\nclear in that sense exactly what the Court meant. I\nthink it's fair to say it certainly meant that the Court\nhadn't required direct evidence in the sense of\nnon-circumstantial evidence, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in your\npetition, you asked -- you used the phrase \"direct\nevidence,\" and I just want to know in what sense you\nmean that?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: We -- it's our view that no\nspecial evidence is required to get the instruction in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a variety of\nviews among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant\nby the term \"direct evidence\"? It wasn't defined in\nPrice Waterhouse either.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, it was not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there is a range of\nviews on what it means, starting from direct versus\ncircumstantial, to something like strong evidence.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: There is a range of views on\nthat, but our view is the burden on the plaintiff is to\nshow by a preponderance of the evidence that in this\ncase age was a motivating factor, but it's not required\nto show it by any particular kind of evidence or to show\nit by strong evidence as opposed to merely evidence\nsufficient to establish that by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Price Waterhouse was a bench\ntrial.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And Mt. Healthy was a bench\ntrial, wasn't it?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I believe so, yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, would the -- if there\nis a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause\na great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give\nan instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury\nwill first have to decide whether a particular type of\nevidence is present in the case before it can tell\nwhat -- who has the burden of proof and what the\nstandard is, but if Price Waterhouse is understood\nsimply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to\nlook at the evidence, does it present any of the\nproblems that have been identified with the Price\nWaterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as\napplied to jury trials?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it wouldn't present\nthe same -- there are special problems applying it to\njury trials. We think that the requirement of direct\nevidence is simply wrong for a number of reasons. At\nthe least, the Court would have to finally resolve what\ndirect evidence means in this particular context.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's just an\ninstruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it\ncould mean that if the judge sitting as the trier of\nfact finds that there is direct evidence, strong\nevidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the\njudge will need to have strong evidence, stronger\nevidence on the other side in order to rule against the\nplaintiff. It's not hard to figure out how it might\nwork out in that situation.\nThe problem comes when it has to be posed in\nthe form of a jury instruction.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's a particularly\nserious problem there, but if you were to announce this\nas a rule, you would -- I think the time has come to\nexplain definitively what \"direct evidence\" means. The\ncourts of appeals are in wide disagreement about that,\nand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was the view of\nonly one justice, Justice O'Connor alone. She did make\nthe fifth vote, but no one else accepted a direct\nevidence test.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, she made the\nsixth vote. There were five members of the Court other\nthan Justice O'Connor who agreed in the result in that\ncase. The plurality expressly rejected a direct\nevidence requirement. Justice White --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you urge that\nwe should count Justice white's decision as the\ncontrolling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: To the extent that you were\ndisposed to resolve this case based an interpretation of\nPrice Waterhouse. But it's our view that the subsequent\ndecision, unanimous decision in Desert Palace, makes it\nunnecessary. Desert Palace indicates that heightened\nproof requirements that -- those are the words of the\nopinion. It suggest they should not be imposed by the\ncourts absent a statutory directive.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But Desert Palace was a\nTitle VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to\nTitle VII?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It was. But that part of\nthe reasoning of the case is not based on the language\nof Title VII other than the absence from Title VII of\nthat specific language. The structure of the opinion\nfirst talks about the definition of \"demonstrate\" in\nsection 701(n). That's obviously not relevant to the\nADEA. But it goes on to say that the absence in Title\nVII of any heightened proof requirement also weighs\nheavily against the Court's inferring, and that part of\nthe reasoning isn't limited to Title VII.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your position,\nyou rest heavily on the argument, I think, but there is\nno textual support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence\nrequirement in order to shift the burden of proof. But\nisn't it true there is no textural support for shifting\nthe burden of proof at all? I mean, I don't see how\nyou can -- can convince us of the first proposition\nwithout confronting the second.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, this Court has on a\nnumber of occasions allocated the burden of proof among\nthe parties, including to a defendant, without a\nspecific textual basis. The Court did so, for example,\nin Burlington Industries v. Eller, where the Court's\nopinion places on the defendant the burden of\nestablishing an affirmative defense in certain types of\nsexual harassment cases. There wasn't a textual basis\nfor that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course,\naffirmative defenses, usually the burden of persuasion\nis on the party asserting the affirmative defense.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: In Justice -- in the case of\nPrice Waterhouse, Justice White characterized this\nallocation as the burden, as an affirmative defense.\nBut this sort of thing routinely with regard to the\nallocation of burdens. It does not happen routinely\nwith regard to heightened evidence requirement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it the only issue\nthat you have raised before us is whether the evidence\nthat does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got\nto be, whatever this means, direct or not? That's the\nonly issue?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's the only issue before\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am I right that the only\nsource of argument for the proposition that it does have\nto be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion,\nseparate opinion?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, that has been the\nprimary basis for the argument in the courts below. I\nthink Respondent has other arguments as well.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There are arguments about\nthe need for substantial evidence. But the argument for\ndirect evidence goes back to the separate O'Connor --\nO'Connor opinion.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's certainly the origin.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And are you -- I mean,\nwe're going to hear about this. Are you going to make\nan argument to the effect that that should not be\nregarded as the controlling opinion, and if that is the\nsource of it, that is the end of the issue. Are you\ngoing to get into that?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I would be happy -- I\nwould be happy to get into it, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think you should.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: As -- as Justice Ginsburg\npointed out, there are -- there were actually six\nmembers of the Court in Price Waterhouse who concurred\nin the result. Four members of the Court in the\nplurality expressly rejected a direct evidence\nrequirement and said there were no limit on the type of\nevidence that could be used.\nJustice White said that the plaintiff's\nburden was to show that in that case gender was a\nsubstantial factor. He didn't say substantial evidence\nwas required.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand the White\nopinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the\nevidence. It had to do with the degree of\npersuasiveness of the evidence; is that correct?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: With due respect, no, Your\nHonor. It had to do --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then I don't understand\nwhat \"substantial\" means. What do you think he meant by\nthat?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The \"substantial factor\" was\nsomewhere on the scale of a very unimportant factor or a\nvery, very important factor, which is separate from how\nclear the evidence was that it was a small or large\nfactor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to\nJustice Souter's question you said you're only focusing\non the direct evidence threshold. But if direct\nevidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of\nshifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it\nreally fair for you to be able to say, we are only going\nto take out one side of the behalf, we are going to\nleave the other side of the balance there? It seems to\nme that it's artificial to separate the two\nrequirements, the two aspects of the Price Waterhouse\ninquiry.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- the Price\nWaterhouse plurality and Justice White didn't see two\naspects. The requirement was proof by a preponderance\nof the evidence that in the case gender was a motivating\nfactor, and for five members of the Court that was\nsufficient. There wasn't -- there wasn't something else\nthat went with it. There was for Justice O'Connor, but\nshe's the sixth vote. And -- and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand the\ndifficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in\nPrice Waterhouse. But at least as it has been applied,\nmy understanding -- I understand it has been applied in\ndifferent ways. My understanding of what people mean\nwhen they say \"the Price Waterhouse approach,\" which is\nthat there is a higher showing of evidence, direct\nevidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that\nmeans. But if you meet that showing, then the burden of\npersuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of\ncausation.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that is\nprecisely the issue on which the lower courts have been\ndivided. Some courts have expressly rejected that view\nand have taken the view that there is no special\nheightened standard of any kind. Other courts think\nthat it is required. That is what we are -- what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Schnapper, there\nis a difference -- and I think it's critical to your\ncase -- between what is called the prima facia case that\nthe plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas\ntest and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that\nin this case age discrimination was a motivating factor.\nI think you must concede that in order to fit within\nthis double motive frame you must show not simply a\nprima facia case, but by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. We -- we are obligated\nto do that, and the -- the defendant has argued below\nand would, I think, on remand still be in a position to\nargue that we didn't have enough evidence to meet that\nburden. But that question isn't before us.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- can one know if\nyou've met that burden before the case goes to the jury?\nThat is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown\nwhether you have established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that age discrimination was a motivating\nfactor.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, whether there is\nsufficient evidence is often tested by a motion for\nsummary judgment. So courts do look at that matter,\nthat issue, before trial. What -- what isn't knowable\nbefore trial -- and -- and frankly is often known only\nto the jury -- is whether the jury will conclude that\nthe defendant acted with two motives or one motive.\nThat -- that isn't something you would normally be able\nto -- to resolve before the case went to trial or even\nduring the course of the trial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, correct me if I am\nwrong. I assume that in a jury case that simply was\nleft to the jury, and the instructions would be\nsomething like this: If you find that the plaintiff has\nshown that age was a motivating factor, then you look to\nthe next question. And that is: Has the defendant\nshown that he would have fired the plaintiff anyway?\nIsn't that the way it works?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's the -- that's the way\nit works. Yes, that's the way it works. And that --\nthat is the way it works in -- in a Title VII case\nbecause of the language of the statute. The juries\nroutinely get that instruction in those cases. That's\ncertainly proof --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in -- in response\nfurther to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think\nJustice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any\ntactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that\ncounsel face if they don't quite know which way the\nburden is going to shift before trial: The -- the\nnumber of witnesses you have waiting in the hallway or\n-- this -- this would be after summary judgment.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No more than would normally\nbe the case. What happened here in terms of jury\ninstructions was typical, which was the parties proposed\ntheir differing instructions a week before trial, the\ninstructions were resolved at the end of trial. That --\nthat happens all the time.\nSometimes if the parties don't know how the\ninstructions are going to come out, that complicates\ntheir tactics, but that happens every day in trials.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- before you sit\ndown, I -- I have been trying to figure out Justice\nWhite's opinion in Price Waterhouse. I mean, indeed he\n-- he voted to -- to remand the case, as did -- as did\nthe four in the plurality, but for a very different\nreason. They remanded because -- \"We reverse the court\nof appeals' judgment against Price Waterhouse because\nthe courts below erred by deciding that the defendant\nmust make\" the proof of he would have been fired anyway\nby clear and convincing evidence. That -- that was the\nbasis for their reversing and remanding.\nThat was not Justice White's, because -- he\nsaid \"because the court of appeals required Price\nWaterhouse to prove by clear and convincing evidence\nthat it would have reached the same\" -- \"in the absence\nof the improper motive. Rather than merely requiring\nproof by a preponderance of the evidence, I concur in\nthe judgment reversing this case in part and remanding.\nWith respect to the employer's burden, however, the\nplurality seems to require that the employer submit\nobjective evidence.\" And he disagreed with that.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: All right. There -- there\nwere a number of different issues in the case. The\nfirst, the court of appeals had held that when the\nburden is on the employer to show it would have made the\nsame decision anyway, the employer has to meet that\nburden with clear and convincing evidence.\nThe plurality and Justice White, the whole\ncourt rejected that.\nSecondly, the plurality suggested that the\nemployer in response would have to have objective\nevidence. Justice White rejected that and the objective\nevidence standard has not been followed by the lower\ncourts in -- in the wake of that.\nThe third question was whether the burden\nshould be placed on the employer. On that issue the\nCourt was divided six to three. Six Justices, as we --\nas we noted, were for that burden allocation. The --\nJustice Kennedy and -- and yourself and the Chief\nJustice dissented. So there were many issues.\nThank you. I would like to reserve the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think both on a substantive level and a\nprocedural level Desert Palace largely resolves this\ncase. The question presented is the one of should you\nhave a direct evidence requirement to obtain a mixed\nmotive instruction under the Age Act. And there is the\nprocedural posture, which is Desert Palace left\nunresolved a lot of very difficult and complicated\nquestions about when do you get to the jury on mixed\nmotive and what is the requirement that separates a\nmixed motive motivating factor instruction from the\n\"but-for\" or commonly known as the McDonnell Douglas.\nAnd Desert Palace left all that unresolved.\nOn the question presented, there is the same\nconflict in the circuits under the Age Act. It is the\nsame conflict in the circuits that was under Title VII\n-- is do you need any kind of evidentiary special\nshowing to get to a mixed motive; and, if so, is it non-\ncircumstantial evidence or evidence that directly ties\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? Do\nyou think that there is a tenable distinction between a\nmixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case? In\nevery employment discrimination case that gets beyond\nsummary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play?\nMS. BLATT: I think there is a lot to be\nsaid for that argument, and this is a very difficult and\nunsettled question under Title VII. I think what would\nbe on the table if this Court ever had an appropriate\nvehicle -- and this certainly is not the appropriate\nvehicle to get into this question -- there would be\nseveral options on the table. You could have what your\nview suggests, which is after summary judgment you could\nget a motivated factor instruction that the jury would\nbe permitted to find both impermissible and permissible\nmotives.\nYou could also have a special verdict form\nthat asks the jury: Do you find that there were two\ncauses, one of which was an impermissible factor? And\nyou could have a situation which I think prevails in\ntrial courts now -- and it has been the EEOC's practice\n-- which is -- and it's not the most analytically clean,\nbut they basically give the instruction, either a\ndeterminative cause or motivating factor instruction, on\nwhat they think best fits the evidence.\nAnd I think it's important for the Court to\nunderstand, as we -- the law exists now under Title VII\nand under all the other anti-discrimination acts, there\nare two regimes out there. There is a mixed motive\nregime and a determining factor regime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Couldn't -- couldn't any\nTitle VII case be presented in either framework?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. But this is -- I will also\ngive you, which I think is important especially when you\nwrite your opinion, the three reasons why you should not\nresolve this very difficult question in this case. And\nthe first is that it wasn't pressed or passed on below\nor raised in the brief in opposition and did not receive\nfull briefing by the parties and all the amici.\nAnd, second, just as you left this issue\nopen in footnote 1 of your opinion in Desert Palace,\nJudge Collatin writing for the court recognized this\nprecise issue in footnote 3 of the court's opinion on\npetition appendix page 12, saying: Assuming there is no\ndirect evidence requirement, we are going to have to\nfigure out when is it appropriate to give a motivating\nfactor instruction, absent the -- the language,\nexpressed language in Title VII?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you --\nMS. BLATT: The third reason --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I will let you get\nyour third reason in in a minute, but why -- do you\nreally think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated\ntest that the court has constructed and say, well, this\none doesn't make any sense, and pull it out? I mean,\nmaybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole\nconstruct, or maybe none of the elements actually make\nsense. But it seems to me very artificial to focus on\none aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing\nwhat its impact is on the rest of the text.\nMS. BLATT: I see your point, even though\nthat is exactly what you did in Desert Palace. But\nPrice Waterhouse is a two-decade-old decision. We're 20\nyears past that and it has been essentially codified in\nTitle VII. So no matter what you do to, quote unquote,\n\"fix this\" under the Age Act, every -- the bulk of the\ndiscrimination cases fall under Title VII, and a\nmotivating factor instruction is codified, and you\nunanimously held in Desert Palace there is no special\nevidentiary requirement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- that was\nbecause -- that was because of the 1991 Act which\naddressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA\nout.\nMS. BLATT: Unless you overrule Price\nWaterhouse, which would be an upheaval in the law, and\ncertainly -- this wouldn't be the appropriate case to do\nit, all the courts of appeals have unanimously held\nunder the Age Act and under a wide variety of State\nstatutes and other Federal discrimination statutes that\nthe Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework applies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are asking us to\noverrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct\nevidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's\nopinion.\nMS. BLATT: I don't think you need to decide\nthat question. In a lot of other contexts, you have\nsaid, well, there is language in our opinion that may\nhave been confusing or it's not clear what the holding\nis, but we henceforth are going to clarify, here's what\nthe law is.\nYou did it in the recent crack cocaine case\nin Spears, you did it in your nude dancing case, and you\ndid it in a case called Jefferson v. City of Tarrant\nCounty, an opinion Justice Ginsburg authored, that you\nsaid: Well, there is language here that substantive\ncases make clear, and there is lots of reasons why you\nwould not impose a direct evidence requirement, however\nyou define that term.\nSince Desert Palace, there is a decision of\nSprint/United v. Mendelsohn. And I think that case a\nfortiori forecloses all the arguments made by the other\nside that, well, even if it doesn't mean\nnon-circumstantial evidence, it must mean something that\nis highly relevant to the issue of discrimination. In\nSprint/United you said we're not going to have a per se\nrule about what is relevant to prove discrimination.\nThe Court said the same thing in Reeves. I think that\nwas a unanimous decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would\nbe the position of the Solicitor General on just saying\nlet's get rid of all these artificial court\nconstructions and say this is like any other case, the\nplaintiff has the burden of persuasion and the defendant\ncan come up with what defenses he has, including that, I\ndid this for some other reason, it wasn't because of\nage, and the jury looks at it and decides who they\nbelieve?\nMS. BLATT: You would still have the same\nissue as you have under the constitutional regime of\nwhat is causation? And if you ask my opinion, the\nSolicitor General in Price Waterhouse itself argued\nsomething different that no Justice adopted. We argued\na standard of causation that no one -- no one was\npersuaded by. Six went off on this motivating factor\nwith the burden shifting approach, and three of the\nJustices would have applied a straight \"but for\"\ncausation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute -- the\nstatute has language. It says \"because of.\" Tell the\njury that.\nMS. BLATT: Absolutely. And it did in Title\nVII, and this Court, for better or worse -- regardless\nof what you think, in Price Waterhouse six Justices\ndefined the language \"because of.\" And we have Price\nWaterhouse now that is codified. And so --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any\nempirical evidence to show whether any of this really\nmakes a difference. Have there been studies on the\neffect of the 1991 amendments, whether they have made a\ndifference in the way cases actually come out?\nMS. BLATT: No. Let me just say two\nresponses. Not that I have seen empirical. I can tell\nyou the EEOC's experience, and that is they sometimes\nprefer a \"but for\" all the burden being on them and\nsometimes they prefer the motivating factor instruction.\nAnd despite what Respondent points out, they have some\ndefendants that think they like the affirmative defense.\nAnd sometimes counsel just agree on what the\ninstruction should be. And it hasn't caused that much\nof a problem, although there is a lot of confusion about\nthis kind of case, where the defendant is insisting on\none instruction and the plaintiff wants another\ninstruction, and that's what Judge Collatin is reserving\nin a footnote saying: On remand I am going to have to\nsort this out.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what the\nparties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury,\nregardless of instruction, is going to say something\nlike this: If we find that -- that age really was in\nthe boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss\ncomes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the\nguy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late\nand so on, the jury is going to say: Did they really\nfire him because he was old or because he didn't come to\nwork on time?\nThey are going to do the same thing that\nthey are going to do on the burden-shifting instruction,\nprobably, aren't they?\nMS. BLATT: I mean -- there are two kinds of\njury findings. There is -- but the problem in all this\narea, if you do ever get a case that is appropriate, I\nthink what the Court should start with the assumption\nwhich Justice Alito alluded to: Price Waterhouse was a\nbench trial. The 1991 amendments under Title VII were\nagainst the backdrop of non-jury trials. And both the\nPrice Waterhouse decision and the language of Title VII\nare written ex post. It's assuming some artificial\nworld where there was a finding of mixed motive.\nBut in today's world everything needs to be\ndone ex ante. We need to know how to instruct the jury,\nand that's the fundamental problem.\nIf you are looking at ex post world, you are\nexactly right, a jury could either find this was all a\npretext, I think what was really going on was ageism or\nsexism or racism, or it could find, a split the baby, I\nthink it's both. But you can't possibly know that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can't know it --\nMS. BLATT: -- going in.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you said to the\njury, do the right thing, they'd probably come out the\nsame way it would come out if you gave the burden\nshifting instruction, I think.\nMS. BLATT: I think you are basically\ncatching on the point that a lot of counsel in the real\nworld are basically deciding, what do we think the jury\nis going to be most on our side with, with which\ninstruction. And it's not always clear going into the\ncase, and maybe depending on the relative strength of\nthe legitimate factor being asserted. Some defendants\nmay prefer the affirmative defense. Some may think, no,\nit's prejudicial, we don't want that, we want a straight\ndetermining factor instruction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason I raise the\nissue is, if -- if we are saying do we ditch Price\nWaterhouse, my questions I guess are suggesting\nsomething to the effect, what difference does it make?\nMS. BLATT: Well, I don't think you can\nditch Price Waterhouse as a practical matter, because\nyou are going to create -- I mean -- massive confusion,\nnot only under the Age Act, but under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, a\nvariety of labor statutes, disciplinary statutes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Juries -- juries are\nsmarter than judges.\nMS. BLATT: Well, you can do that, but all\nthe problems you think you are solving, you are going to\nhave to face them in Title VII. That is the bulk of\ndiscrimination law, and you have two standards of\ncausation in that statute right now.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead and make\nyour third point briefly.\nMS. BLATT: Oh, on why you shouldn't decide\nit? It's essentially this, that this is complicated,\ndifficult under Title VII. That's the leading\nanti-discrimination statute. I think the Court may want\nto resolve these very legitimate important questions in\na Title VII case, because you have got statutory\nlanguage.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIt does seem to me in some ways the\nPetitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing\nin the night because the issues here are unbelievably\ncomplicated. I will say in 25 years of advocacy before\nthis Court I have not seen one area of the law that\nseems to me as difficult to sort out as this particular\none is.\nThat said, I would hope that the Court would\nseize upon this as an opportunity to provide some\nsignificant clarity in the law, rather than seize this\nas an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially\nmost narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can\ntell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately,\nbut certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass\nconfusion that seems to exist among the lower courts.\nSo, I would urge the Court not to evaluate\nthis case strictly on the question of whether direct\nversus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to\nproceed. In part that's because that is not the basis\non which the Eighth Circuit decided this case.\nThe Eighth Circuit said that it interpreted\nJustice O'Connor's separate opinion calling for direct\nevidence as talking about a specific link between the\nproof -- in the proof of the discriminatory\nconsiderations and the adverse action that was taken.\nSo, direct versus circumstantial doesn't even -- you\nknow, if you remand to evaluate non-circumstantial\nevidence, you are still not going to be in a position\nwhere that is going to affect the outcome.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the court\nof appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was\nthe controlling opinion, it was the decision on the\nnarrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to\ntake that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse.\nThen there's a question of what did she mean\nby direct evidence? But I think the Eighth Circuit\ncertainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the\nlaw of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which\ntheir decision turned.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, then -- of course, they\ngo on to say what they think that decision means. But\nthere is no question, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the\nbasis for that holding.\nSo, I mean, I suppose the Court could say,\nno, we disagree with the basis of Price Waterhouse as\nJustice White's separate concurring opinion, which,\nfrankly, I think it is -- you know, having read it more\ntimes than I care to admit, is not exactly clear as to\nwhat he thinks the appropriate standard would have been.\nAt least Justice Ginsburg's provides the formulation\nthat the lower courts can use to try to provide some\nkind of a jury instruction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice O'Connor.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Did I say Ginsburg?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm going to hear about this\none.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I apologize.\nBut the problem -- you know, the -- but the\nfundamental problem is, it's just simply not clear what\nJustice White's opinion means. And therefore, the lower\ncourts have seized upon an opinion that at least\nprovided serious guidance that they could embody into a\njury instruction.\nIt goes to the point that Justice Alito was\nmaking, which is that, it's one thing when you are\ndealing with bench trials and what do you ask the judge\nto do, it's something fundamentally different when you\nare shifting the burden of proof.\nJustice Kennedy asked the question does it\nmake a difference tactically, and the same question\nJustice Souter in some ways was asking and the answer is\nclearly it does, and you can see it in this case.\nHere's a situation where the defendant prior to the\ntrial shows up, or when the jury gets selected. Opening\nstatement says there is going to be no evidence of\nactual age discrimination in this case. The case is\ntried on that theory. The basis for the judgment that\nthere is going to be no evidence of age discrimination\nin this case is the discovery, extensive discovery that\nhas taken place, where there is no statements by anyone\ntalking about age, no other employee who believes that\nhe or she had been ever been affected by age. It's all\nof this very abstract claim and the notion that somehow\nthere is no better explanation for what happened except\nfor age.\nYou go through the entirety of the trial\nsaying to the jury, there is no evidence of age, there\nis no evidence of age discrimination, and then at the\nlast minute, not because you have asserted an\naffirmative defense -- because we didn't assert an\naffirmative defense -- one is foisted on us by the jury\ninstruction that the plaintiff asked for in this\nparticular case that says that if there is a motivating\nfactor, if you can prove a motivating factor -- which it\nis interesting to get to the specifics of a motivating\nfactor, which means it played a part or a role, which is\nabout as minimalist as you can have it -- then the\nburden shifts and we then have the burden to prove that\nwe would have taken the same action notwithstanding age.\nWell, that's a very different inquiry, and\nwhen you go to the jury at the end you can't conceive --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I ask\nyou --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you your views\non a question that I've asked myself over and over again\nand had trouble finding the answer. Supposing a company\nappointed a committee to decide whether or not to fire\nX. And the committee came back and said: \"Yes, you\nshould fire him; he's too old and he's late to work\nevery day.\"\nNow -- and that's all the evidence in the\nrecord. Would the -- would the judge be obliged to\nenter a judgment on summary judgment -- at the end of\nthe plaintiff's case, to enter judgment for the\ndefendant?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't believe he would\nbe required to enter judgment on the defendant.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because all that would\nhave been proved was there is one motivating factor\nthere, but not necessarily a decisive one.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but I -- it does seem\nto me that the jury -- it would be fair to ask the jury\nto decide which of those two considerations probably\nplayed the greater role. But I think -- and that's why\nI think taking it to the jury is one thing. Switching\nthe burden of proof to insist that we prove that the --\nthat the nondiscriminatory ground was the primary reason\nfor the decision is -- is an inappropriate way to\nproceed because there is no basis in the statute for\nthat. The plaintiff still retains the burden to prove\nthat there was discrimination because of.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he has only proved\nthat it is one of two possible motivating factors, but\nthat is sufficient in your view to get to the jury.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would think that that would\nbe sufficient to get to the jury, because I don't think\nwe have to prove -- I don't think the plaintiff has to\nprove, you know, obviously, beyond a reasonable doubt or\nanything. I mean, I think the jury could fairly say\nthat those are the two grounds, and I think in some ways\nthat -- that is the sort of common sense basis on which\nPrice Waterhouse was decided. And it's -- you know,\nit's important -- if -- you know, the Chamber of\nCommerce brief actually focuses a great deal, Justice\nStevens, on this multi-member decisionmaking body. And\nyou know, it seems to me if you look at cases like Mt.\nHealthy and Price Waterhouse, those are all cases where\nyou have multi-member decisionmakers, and some of whom\nmay have expressed some biases and others of whom\nclearly didn't, and how do you deal with that situation,\nwhich impresses me as fundamentally different that the\nsituation here where you have a single supervisor\ndealing with a single employee and where the case is\ntried on the theory that there has been no\ndiscrimination whatsoever, and it's up to the jury to\nmake that determination at the end, and at the last\nminute we have the jury instruction that shifts the\nburden to us notwithstanding that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- we never sought to make\nthis an affirmative defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you think you should\nhave the burden in the following situation? At 10:00\no'clock on March 21st the employer says: I am going to\nget rid of Smith because he's too old.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's it. Writes out the\nletter, \"Good-Bye, Smith.\" An hour later someone walks\ninto the employer's office and says: \"I've discovered\nthat Smith was just convicted of larceny.\" All right?\nNow, he already fired Smith because he was too old. But\nI take it he can make the defense: Well, Smith would\nhave been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired\nhim, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get\noff. But he should make that defense, shouldn't he?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, that's a Banner case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So the answer is\nyes?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now we have\nthe same situation, but the jury has said this bad\nreason, his age, was a motivating factor.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Played a role.\nJUSTICE BREYER: To me -- it didn't say\nplayed a role.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, it did.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it says in this\ninstruction that I have -- I don't see the other one --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's on page 10 of the joint\nappendix.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have on page 7 of\nthe -- of appellant's brief that the instruction was\n\"the plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in\ndefendant's decision.\"\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But -- right. It\njust --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now when I read that, I\nthink --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Can I just, if you go to the\nnext instruction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- it says a -- \"Plaintiff's\nage was a motivating factor if plaintiff's age played a\npart or a role in the defendant's decision.\" So \"a\nmotivating factor\" is a very narrow formulation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, okay, all right,\nfine.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- as instruction in this\nparticular case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Perfect, perfect. I didn't\nwant to complicate it, but that may work in your favor\nto complicate it, and I want to be fair.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. It played a part.\nIt did have a role: Age motivated in part. Now why\nisn't that the end of the matter? Because we have a\nstatute that says age shouldn't play a role in. \"Play a\nrole\" means it made a difference. I mean, to me.\nOtherwise it played no role. It was an understudy, a\nghost. It \"played a role\" if it would have made a\ndifference. \"Played a part,\" it would have made a\ndifference, just like my first case.\nSo we have an action, other things being\nequal, that should be illegal under this statute. But\nthen, just as in the first case, we give the employer a\ndefense: If you can show that in the absence of that\nage there in your mind, you would have done it anyway,\nwhich means the mix of motives would have been\ndifferent, then you get off.\nSo, if in the first case we in fact say it\nshould be on the -- burden should be on the employer,\nwhy shouldn't it be in the second case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean -- in the first\nplace, saying that something is a motivating factor or\nplayed a role is, as a sufficient basis on which to\nimpose liability, is flatly inconsistent with what this\nCourt has said numerous time. It said it in Burdine, it\nsaid it in Reeves, it said it in Hazen Paper, it said it\nI think last term in the Kentucky case, where it says it\nhas to play a role and be determinative. And that's the\nstandard the Court has announced over and over again in\nage discrimination cases.\nThe \"a motivating factor\" formulation does\ncome in Title VII, but that's because of the 1991\nstatute that specifically frames the argument in terms\nof \"a motivating factor.\" So the -- the bottom line\nhere is that, unless the Court deviates from the\nhistoric practice, which is if you are in civil\nlitigation the plaintiff retains the burden of proof\nthroughout the process --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Price Waterhouse\ndeviated -- that was --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have these two regimes\nout there. You are reciting McDonnell Douglas and say\neverything should follow that pattern, but to do that\nyou have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave\nrecognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out\nof Mt. Healthy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, my basic point on Price\nWaterhouse is that it seemed to me reasonably clear that\na majority of the Court, whether you -- whether you rely\nupon Justice White or Justice O'Connor -- clearly didn't\nintend for the jury -- for the burden of proof to shift\nwilly-nilly. But it's supposed to be an exception to\nthe rule, narrowly defined. And the reality --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper recognized\nwhen I asked this question, how does this differ from\nthe prima facie case that you make under McDonnell\nDouglas and -- he said: We don't have to just make a\npreliminary showing; we have to establish by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the prohibited\ndiscrimination was a motivating factor.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Played -- played a role.\nThere is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. But\nthat is not much different, frankly, from a prima facie\nshowing. The truth is if you only make a prima facie\nshowing and the defendant doesn't show up, you will have\nin fact satisfied your burden.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you will get to the\njury and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury\ncan find in your favor. But the difference between a\nprima facie showing and what has to be shown here is,\nthe jury must actually find, based on your at least\nprima facie evidence, that age was a motivating factor,\nand until the jury makes that finding, if it is properly\ninstructed, it doesn't get to the question of whether\nthe defendant has any burden to show something in\nresponse. Isn't that correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is no question --\nI mean, although again what a motivating factor means is\nstill to my mind extraordinarily narrow in this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, let me\njust --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- or limited in terms of\nwhat is required here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not quite sure I\nunderstand one thing. If it's a motivating factor, it's\nenough to get by summary judgment and get the case to\nthe jury, but the -- the defendant will still win, if I\nunderstand all this, if he -- if the defendant proves,\nyes, I did do and it may have had an influence on it,\nbut he would have fired him anyway. And if he -- if he\ncan prove under Mt. Healthy that, yes, he thought about\nage and that -- what raised the issue and everything\nelse, but after he got all through, he was clear he\nfired him because he was a lousy salesman --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and he wins.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Clearly he would win under\nthose circumstances, but the problem there is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So he does not lose just\nbecause you say it's a motivating factor.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, he doesn't lose, but the\nquestion is, what do you do once you make that finding?\nDo you, in fact, at the plaintiff's behest, shift the\nburden of proof to the defendant? I mean, it admits one\nthing, and the Solicitor General, you know, has properly\nidentified that in some instances the defendants as a\ntactical matter are willing to accept as an affirmative\ndefense and -- and pursue the course you just\narticulated, Justice Stevens.\nBut that's not what happened in this case.\nWe were not prepared to accept the idea that age played\na role. We still don't think the evidence supports\nthat. That's obviously not the issue here before us,\nbut it does make it extremely important to resolve the\nquestion of, at what stage can you foist, essentially --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Will you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: --- an affirmative defense on\nthe other side?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Will you go back? I'm\nsorry to be hung up on this point. Maybe there are\n15 cases that just prove I am wrong. But I'm -- I'm\ntrying to figure out -- let's try other areas of the\nlaw. The dam is a nuisance. We now show, to prove that\nit's a nuisance, that it played a role in the death of\nmy fish. I mean, isn't that the end of the case?\nDamages might be at issue -- how much of a role -- but\nas far as liability is concerned the gears were rusty.\nThe rusty gears played a role in the derailing of the\ntrain. Again, it might be a question of who is\nresponsible for what, but that there is liability I\nthink in most areas of tort law would be over once you\nprove that the defendant's factor played a role.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is the law here -- am I\nwrong about ordinary tort law? Possibly. I don't know\nit that well. Is it that I -- is it that this area is\nspecial? Is it that there are cases so you can say any\nof those three? I am prepared to be totally wrong. I\nhope not.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I am always reluctant to say\nthat, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can say that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that, in ordinary\ntort law, the standard of causation is both a\ncombination of \"but for\" and proximate causation, so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think \"played a role\"\ncombines at least the necessary condition, but I don't\nknow --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if you have to --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that's a fair --\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Played a role\" -- how did\nit play a role if it was not a necessary?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, at least as\nI read the difference between the plurality opinion in\nPrice Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in\nthat case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a\nmotivating factor is actually a standard below \"but for\"\ncausation. The plurality was unwilling to accept even\n\"but for\" causation as a requirement under the Age\nDiscrimination and Employment Act. The rest of the\nJustices seemed to not -- not accept that. But that\nseems to me the very -- yes, the basic holding of the\nplurality -- again, not of the Court -- is that\nsomething less than \"but for\" causation is required. I\nwould be delighted, candidly, if the court would go back\nto just \"but for\" causation as the element of age\ndiscrimination because I think, if you get to that\npoint, you get out of this business of trying to figure\nout at what point do you shift the burden. If you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that question -- I\nthink it can't be before us. We would certainly want to\nknow what the government's position is on it. And Ms.\nBlatt was very clear that the government is not taking a\nposition on that issue today. Your brief in opposition\ndid not so much as mention McDonnell Douglas. So how is\nanybody to think that was at stake, that that regime,\nwhich you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you\nthink should be the sole test? How could that come into\nthis case when it's not in the brief in opposition and,\ntherefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's\nnot in the government's brief?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be clear about this,\nI'm not pushing so much the, quote, McDonnell Douglas\nframework as I am Burdine, Hazen Paper, and the other\ncases that talk about \"determinative factor.\" And all\nwe're saying is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your line is\nfollowing that same formula. All those cases are\nfollowing that litany: prima facie case, discriminatory\nreason --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Determinative factor, right.\nI think the answer to the question, Justice Ginsburg, is\nthe -- the way the Chief Justice asked the question,\nwhich is, how sensible is it to pull the one thread out\nof -- out of the Price Waterhouse analysis, assuming\nthat Justice O'Connor speaks for the Court in some\nsense, you know, without examining how that plays in,\ngiven the underlying theory of the case? And I think\nthat's a perfectly valid point. If the Court thinks\nadditional briefing is warranted, then it would seem to\nme the right answer is to -- is to call for additional\nbriefing, but I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Solicitor General\nsays, well, this is going to affect Title VII. It's\ngoing to affect all kinds of other acts. This is a\nwatershed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Kennedy,\nclearly it's going to affect Title VII.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- pardon me?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Clearly is it going to affect\nTitle VII.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's statutory.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, because there's a\nspecific statute that defines it as a motivating factor,\nshifts the burden, and creates an entire remedial regime\nthat doesn't exist under the age discrimination statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- let's assume we\nhave authority to incorporate the Title VII\njurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice.\nAre there reasons why there should be distinctions\nbetween the two regimes?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the primary one\nis the 1991 amendment, where Congress clearly changed\nthe language in Title VII.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there reasons of\nadministration or fairness other than -- I recognize\nthat one is statutory and the others would -- would be\nour case law.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me it's\nbeyond that. I mean, there's almost a separation of\npowers problem when you say it's statutory because,\nagain, Congress very consciously decided to modify Title\nVII, created a complete regime. It would be a bit of a\nstretch for this Court not only to modify the standards\nin a way that would change substantive liability but\nwould create the -- the affirmative defense as a\nremedial component of it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in addition to that,\nMr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with\nlegitimate reasons for employment discrimination than\nrace and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Both Congress and this Court\nhave recognized precisely that as a problem. I mean,\nthere are reasons to treat age discrimination\ndifferently from other forms of discrimination. But,\nagain, you know, there's no question that if you revisit\nPrice Waterhouse, it will change some -- the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act and some of the other provisions.\nBut the reality is, if you are talking about\na mess to begin with, the truth is the lower courts are\nin a state of -- of disrepair at this point in any\nevent. And it's even shown in this case.\nI mean, the truth is the Eighth Circuit has\nthree different formulations of Justice O'Connor's\nevidence standard: circumstantial, strong evidence, and\nsubstantial evidence, substantial factor. So if you are\na district court judge sitting in the Eighth Circuit,\nyou can pick any one of those -- those three to go with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to\nJustice Stevens's hypothetical? You have two people\nmaking a decision; one says it's because of age and the\none says it's because of something, and -- a legitimate\nfactor -- and you acknowledge that could get to the\njury?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe it could.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And is it under an\ninstruction that simply says \"because of\"?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes -- I mean, if you were\nasking me how I would decide that case, yes, I think it\nought to be -- it ought to be because of.\nNow, if the Court wants to formulate some\ngreater specificity of how the causation standards\napply, that's fine. But, at a minimum, it seems to me\nthe Court would do well to go back at least to the\nnotion of \"but for\" causation as embodied in the Age\nDiscrimination and Employment Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean --\nyou say --\nMR. PHILLIPS: It has never rejected that as\na Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say \"but for\"\ncausation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's\nhypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say\nthat one would not have had -- the discrimination, the\nalleged action, would not have happened but for one\nfactor or the other if they are just two different\nfactors. You would just leave that up to the jury to\nsay because of?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me juries\nare asked to make that kind of a decision. I agree with\nJustice Souter: Juries are a lot smarter than the\nlawyers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but not only that,\nbut the jury would be free to say, well, there were both\nclauses, and the one was illegal. But under the Mt.\nHealthy defense, if they are convinced they would have\nfired this guy anyway, the company gets off.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and I understand that.\nAnd in those situations -- look, Justice O'Connor's\nanalysis of this certainly -- certainly plays to a kind\nof gut feeling. When you -- and Mt. Healthy is a good\nillustration of it, even maybe more so, when you say:\nWe are firing you for two reasons; one of them is\ncompletely invalid, and the other is completely valid.\nWhat are you supposed to do in that situation?\nBut it seems to me that under -- under\nnormal civil litigation rules, and the ones that\nCongress clearly had in its mind, the approach you would\ntake under those circumstances say that's enough to get\nyou to the jury, but that's not enough to force the jury\nto be instructed that they have to rule in favor of the\nplaintiff unless the defendant can show that but-for,\nthat -- that no matter -- regardless of the\ndiscriminatory animus, they nevertheless would have\ntaken precisely the same action. That, to me, is the\nguts of -- of what -- of what this case is about.\nIt's not about direct versus circumstantial\nevidence. It's about under what circumstances does the\nburden of proof shift? And -- and in a case like this\nwhere there's no assertion of an affirmative defense --\nwhereas, I think, Justice Stevens, in your situations,\nthere were -- you know, most likely you would expect a\ndefendant to say, I want to accept that burden because I\nthink I can in fact prove something.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know, but inevitably in\nthese cases the employer is really -- whether he calls\nit an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular\nresistance to the plaintiff 's case, the issue is: Did\n-- would he have fired him anyway? And -- and if he --\nif -- if that's what the jury believes, you can take\nJustice Breyer's view and say that's -- that's not a\nsufficient defense because they acted illegally.\nBut if you are allowed that, you are saying\nnotwithstanding the illegal motive, if you show that the\nreal reason I fired him was unrelated to that, then the\ncompelling reason, you win. And you win despite the\nfact that the process may have violated the statute.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There -- there is no question\nabout that. And it is -- again, the only question is:\nWho bears the burden of proof? And what do you do with\nall of those decisions of this Court that say that\nthe -- that the -- that the burden to -- to show that\nage, or whatever, was the determinative factor rests\nthroughout on the plaintiff?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those weren't --\nthose weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework.\nAnd what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive\nand say in a discrimination case there should be only\none regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of\npersuasion from start to finish. But that's not what\nMcDonnell Douglas did. It's not what the Eighth Circuit\ndid, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up\nuntil the brief on the merits.\nSo -- and you also said that Title VII is\nout of it. The statute has taken care of it in 1991.\nMs. Blatt, I heard her say distinctly that -- that Title\nVII would be affected. She urges us not to touch this\nquestion.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you have to go\nback to the -- to the question that Justice Alito posed\nactually, to say -- when -- when he asked her: How do\nyou -- how much sense does it make to think about mixed\nmotive versus other motive? Isn't it true that by the\ntime the case gets to the jury everything is mixed\nmotive, because there is going to be the claim that this\nwas -- and this is a great illustration of that concept.\nThere is a claim that age was the basis for the\ndecision, and there is a claim that there are any of a\nthousand other possible reasons that are out there, and\nage just didn't happen to be one.\nAnd under those circumstances the question\nis: What's the reasonable way to proceed?\nNow, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize that we\ndidn't raise this specifically in the brief in\nopposition. On the other hand, the reality is that the\nprimary position that was taken by the other side was\nthat this Court essentially can ignore or should\noverrule a portion of Price Waterhouse as a consequence\nof the -- of the intervening Costa decision.\nAnd it seems to me under those\ncircumstances, if you are going to put the issue of the\nvalidity of Price Waterhouse -- whatever it means -- at\nissue, then it seems to us a reasonable response on the\nmerits to say, well, you shouldn't do it as -- as a --\nin isolation. That that's a completely artificial\ninquiry, and you ought to take a step back and say,\nmaybe we haven't gotten this right in the first place,\nparticularly given the difficulty of the lower courts in\ntrying to figure out exactly what Price Waterhouse\nmeans.\nWhose is the controlling opinion, and how do\nyou allocate these burdens and under what circumstances?\nAnd given that the lower courts are in disarray, it\nwould seem to me this is a situation where I don't know\nwhether this is the best vehicle or the worst vehicle,\nbut it is certainly an appropriate vehicle for the Court\nto step back and evaluate it.\nAnd if the Court is concerned about whether\nit has enough information to allow it to assess what\nwould be the -- the significant impact of revising Price\nWaterhouse, then it seems to me the right answer would\nbe to ask the parties to -- to brief that in addition to\nthe way they briefed it at this stage. And now you\nsimply throw up your hands.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I assume -- and I\nassume the government, because it would certainly be\ninformative to know what the agency responsible for the\nadministration of Title VII thinks of this question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't disagree with\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I don't think there are\nany -- any guidelines out there that speak directly to\nthis specific question. But, obviously, to the extent\nthat the Solicitor General could speak for the EEOC,\nthat would -- I am not denying that that would -- that\nmight be helpful. But I think what the -- what the\nCourt needs to do is recognize that what it cannot --\nwhat it should not do in this case is take the -- the\nvery narrowest way of vacating and remanding. Because\nif it follows that course, nothing will move. Nothing\nwill have been achieved by all the work that has been\nput into this case at this point, because the court of\nappeals didn't believe the difference was between direct\nand circumstantial evidence. And, therefore, the Court\nat some point is going to have to evaluate beyond the\nquality of the evidence what quantity of evidence is\nappropriate under the circumstances.\nIt seems to me the Court has that in front\nof it. The jury instruction in this case shifted the\nburden way too early or on -- on way too little showing.\nA part, a role, that's not enough to shift the burden\nunder -- I don't even think under Justice White's\nversion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We can't -- I mean there is\nno question about quantitative evidence here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is a question\nabout the adequacy of the jury instruction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The adequacy of the jury\ninstruction, but there isn't a question as to whether\nthe issue should have gone to the jury in the first\nplace. And I -- I think that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. No, I don't -- there\nis no question that -- that -- well, there is a question\non that. It's not before you. It's -- it's back in\nfront of the Eighth Circuit.\nBut there is still the issue of whether a\nmotivating factor, meaning that it played a role, is a\nsufficient basis on which to trigger the -- the burden\nshifting instruction in this case. That -- that is the\nnarrowest basis on which this Court could affirm by\nsimply saying that Justice White's opinion requires a\nsubstantial showing. The instruction in this case\nclearly doesn't accomplish that, and, therefore, the\nCourt should set that aside, or the Court should affirm\nthe Eighth Circuit and remand so that the district court\ncan have a new trial on that issue.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd urge\nthe Court to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nNow, Mr. Schnapper, two minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWe are in agreement with the government that\nthe Court should decide the -- the narrow question\npresented and not revisit Price Waterhouse. If I might\nrespond to the question from Justice Breyer -- and I am\ngoing to summarize to some extent materials which were\nreferred to in footnote 18 of our reply brief.\nThe Court ruled that there was a\ncircumstance, very well established, which under tort\nlaw but-for causation was not the standard. And that\nwas the situation in Cory versus Havener, which is the\nleading case in this area in which there were two\ncauses, each sufficient to have brought about the\nresult. And Cory was a case of two motorcyclists in\ndistrict court.\nAnd the rule in those cases was that -- that\neither cause -- that the tort feasor involved with\neither cause could be held liable.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Don't those cases involve\ntwo independent physical causes of an event, not the\nbreaking down of human motivation into -- into separate\nfactors?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's -- it's -- but\nit's the analogous area of tort law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they are trying to\nsay, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot\nabout -- we have a human being who did certain acts.\nAnd we know this. We know that human being had a mix of\nmotives and that the bad motive played a role. It was a\nmotivating force. And that might be sufficient. It is\nunder Title VII. And if you want to interpret this by\nTitle VII, that's fine. That's the end of it.\nBut then we are going to let someone off if\nwe imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation.\nThe hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there.\nWell, it's hard to prove what human beings\nwould do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real\nsituation. And I take it that's the reason we have\nimposed this burden upon the employer.\nIs there an analogy to that in tort law?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the problem that\ncomes up with multiple causes is it is hard to\nreconstruct what would happen. And there is a long line\nof cases, including a number of decisions by Learned\nHand in 1938, one which we have cited, Transportation\nManagement, in which the lower courts have agreed that\nwhere multiple factors are involved it's reasonable to\nput the burden on the defendant which -- of sorting it\nall out. And we think that is appropriate here.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
