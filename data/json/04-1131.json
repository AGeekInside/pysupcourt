        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Whitman versus Department of Transportation.\nMs. Karlan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Government now concedes that the Ninth\nCircuit erred in holding that the negotiated grievance\nprocedure of the Civil Service Reform Act strips\nFederal courts of their jurisdiction to hear\nconstitutional claims by Federal employees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not bound by that\nconcession. If that's a jurisdictional question,\ndoesn't matter whether the Government conceded it or\nnot, does it?\nMS. KARLAN: No. That's correct, but the\nGovernment correctly conceded perhaps I should have\nsaid.\nSo I think that the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different question.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. So the question before the\nCourt is not whether, I think, Mr. Whitman can receive\nconstitutional judicial review, but rather, where and\nhow he is supposed to do so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I still think it's whether\nbecause I don't agree with the Government. Can I do\nthat?\nMS. KARLAN: Of course, you can.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that is the question. I\nmean, the question is open whether there --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. I -- I think, obviously,\nthe Court has an obligation to satisfy itself of the\njurisdiction. But I'll point out then that you would\nhave had that obligation as well in NTEU against Von\nRaab in which this Court addressed precisely the same\nkind of case, litigated in precisely the same posture.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it raised? Was that\nobjection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the\nbriefs and --\nMS. KARLAN: It was raised in the district\ncourt and the Government chose not to raise it in the\ncourt of appeals or here. But, of course, you have, as\nJustice Scalia said, an independent obligation to\nsatisfy yourself of your subject matter jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But our cases say that where\nwe don't speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not\nregarded as having been decided.\nMS. KARLAN: No. I'm not saying that you\ndecided it in NTEU against Von Raab, Justice Scalia.\nI'm just saying that given that you were apparently\nsatisfied with the theory, you should be satisfied here\ntoo as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you assume\nthat Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different\nsituation here. The issue isn't whether there will be\nany judicial review. The issue is whether there will\nbe judicial review for the minor grievances, even if\nthey happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are\n-- that are not -- for which judicial review was not\nprovided. Any major employee action -- judicial\nreview, as I understand it, is available, and it is\nonly relatively insignificant actions for which\njudicial review is not available. Isn't that right?\nMS. KARLAN: No. With all respect, Justice\nScalia, I think that's incorrect.\nThe Civil Service Reform Act provides for\njudicial review of personnel actions, and if you go\nback to the opinion for the Court that you wrote in\nFausto, you'll see that you repeatedly referred to them\nas personnel actions there.\nNow, a warrantless search of a Government\nemployee, as this Court's opinion in Bush against Lucas\nsays at note 28, is not a personnel action, and\ntherefore, there is no way of obtaining review of it\nthrough the Civil Service Reform Act. But it is not in\nany sense here a minor violation of Mr. Whitman's\nrights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He could have refused -- he\ncould have refused the search, in which case if there\nwas any significant personnel action taken against him\nfor refusing it, he would have had judicial review of\nwhether the search was constitutional or not.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice Scalia, but he\nwould have to bet the ranch to do it. And I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's often the case where\n-- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental\naction, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to\ncourt by resisting it.\nMS. KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I think that's\nincorrect when it comes to Government agency actions of\nthis kind. That's what the Abbott Laboratories case\nthat we cite in our brief makes quite clear.\nAnd I think last week, just last week, this\nCourt understood precisely that problem in talking\nabout the doctor who faces the abortion statute in\nAyotte. And several members of the Court pointed out\nthat to risk your license there or to risk, in this\ncase, a job that our client has held for 20 years in\norder to challenge whether his Fourth Amendment rights\nare violated is not normally how judicial review should\nbe accomplished.\nAnd so the question here really is how\njudicial review should be accomplished, and we've\nmaintained all along that the way judicial review\nshould be accomplished here is the way that it's\naccomplished in all sorts of cases, by bringing an\naction in the Federal district court seeking injunctive\nrelief.\nNow, what the Government --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though if -- if\n-- do you concede that if he had, for example, refused\nthe testing and been fired and it was a major personnel\naction, he would have to go through the statutory\nprocedures before bringing that -- the constitutional\nclaim on review of those administrative procedures?\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't it seem\nodd -- and this is sort of the logic of -- in Fausto\nand some of the other cases -- that when you have a\nmajor action, you have to exhaust before you can go\ninto court, but if you have something that doesn't\nqualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to\ncourt right away?\nMS. KARLAN: I can see why that might seem at\nfirst a little strange to you, Your Honor. But the\npoint of the CSRA is to deal not with major versus\nminor actions. It's true that minor actions you get\nadministrative review and not judicial review, but\nthat's about personnel actions. Mr. Whitman is not\nchallenging a personnel action here. He's challenging\na warrantless search. The warrantless search was the\nnon-random, arbitrary urinalysis and breathalyzer to\nwhich he was subjected.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that search was a\nconsequence of his employment. It -- this wasn't a\nsearch of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with\nthe Government. It was a search that he was required\nto submit to as an employee. So to -- to describe it\nas unrelated to employee action seems to me\nunrealistic. The only reason he submitted to it was\nthat if he didn't, he would have -- he would have been\nsubject to an employee action.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. He was\nrequired, as a condition of his employment, to submit\nto constitutional drug testing. And his allegation in\nthis case is that this drug test was unconstitutional\nand --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it becomes\nunconstitutional when -- when you have one more test?\nWhat did it become unconstitutional? The first test\nwas not unconstitutional.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. It became\nunconstitutional when it became clear that at the\nAnchorage air traffic control facility, they were not\ncomplying with the requirements both of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How many tests did he have?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, he alleges in his\ncomplaint that he was subjected to 13 tests, and then\nwhen he complained --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Over what period of time?\nMS. KARLAN: Over a period of time of\napproximately 5 years in which other employees were\nsubjected to no more than one or two.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's maybe three --\nthree a year? Is that what it was?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, but he was picked --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's\nunconstitutional?\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Stevens. His\nallegation is he was picked seven times in a row for\nrandom drug testing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, somebody will be if\nit's random. If you have thousands of people, somebody\nwill be if it is random. If there were nobody who was\npicked seven times, that would show it wasn't random.\nSo, you know --\nMS. KARLAN: Right, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- whether he has a good\nconstitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, he may well not. He may\nwell lose on his constitutional claim, Justice Breyer,\nand that's not the issue before this Court. The\nquestion is whether a district judge should decide,\nshould listen to the facts and decide whether this was\nrandom or not.\nI tried once to calculate what are the\nchances of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are they? How many\npeople are there? How many people are tested if you\ntry to calculate it? How many --\nMS. KARLAN: I -- I tried to do it and I\ncouldn't do it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in the Federal\nGovernment?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, it wouldn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All you do is you get a bell\ncurve and you ask the Library of Congress and they'll\ndo it --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, right, but it would be --\nI -- I know. You know, I -- it -- my calculator\ndoesn't go that high.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. It's -- it's not hard\nto do.\nMS. KARLAN: But it's high.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's not hard to do.\nYou just ask someone at Stanford. They'll do it for\nyou.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the --\nMS. KARLAN: It's the undergraduates that\nknow how to do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Regardless, this\nis beside the point.\nI -- all right. Can I -- I just want you at\nsome point to get to not just the constitutional\nquestion. Maybe he can go in and raise his claim. I\ndon't know if he should have exhausted or not, et\ncetera.\nMS. KARLAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I find it hard, in\nreading this, to believe the following. Like any other\nworker, I mean, normally you have a collective\nbargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor\nthing. And here, what you're saying is although if\nit's a major thing, like a personnel action, there's a\nspecial thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you\nget into court way down the road. It's very\ncomplicated. This individual, even though he\nclassifies it as a grievance where the union is\nsupposed to take it up and the union tells him we're\nnot going to take it up, we don't believe in your\nclaim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge.\nNow, that -- that I find surprising, and I'd like you\nto explain how in your theory that works.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. The\nproblem with assuming that a union will take a claim\nlike this to arbitration is the following. Unions\ngenerally do not take individual employee grievances to\narbitration, especially if you look at this collective\nbargaining agreement, which requires the union to pay\nthe costs if they lose.\nNow, on a claim like this, for the very\nreason that you suggested earlier, it may be difficult\nto figure out what the facts are.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position,\nMs. Karlan, was that he doesn't even have to ask the\nunion. Justice Breyer is presenting a scenario where\nhe asks the union and the union says we've got better\nthings to do with our money.\nMS. KARLAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think your position\nis he doesn't have to ask at all. He can go directly\ninto Federal court under 1331.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. Just as, for\nexample, the employees did in the NFFE against\nWeinberger case on which you sat in the court of\nappeals where the Government again there tried to argue\nthere was no subject matter jurisdiction, and the court\nreally gave that argument the back of its hand because\ntraditionally the way that someone who wants to allege,\nsomeone who is an employee or not who wants to allege,\nthat there -- that he's seeking injunctive relief for a\nconstitutional violation, goes to the Federal district\ncourts under 28 U.S.C. 1331, not to a negotiated\ngrievance procedure that was not intended and cannot\noperate in the way that the Government seems to hope --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why -- why can't he?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Because my --\nwhen I first looked at this, I thought, well, this is\nthe kind of thing that should have been -- should have\nbeen resolved at the grievance level, it shouldn't have\neven have to get to arbitration if he's right. He\nwants a survey to see if he's being picked on. If he\nis, there would be redress. So it seemed like this was\nthe kind of complaint that was best handled in that\nkind of procedure.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, I have two somewhat\ndifferent answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg.\nOne, which I'll turn to in a moment, is about the\nspecifics of this case, but I want to give the more\ngeneral one first. And that is, that the negotiated\ngrievance procedures that unions set up are for the\nbenefit of employees who believe that that is the best\nway of seeking to resolve their complaints, and most\ncomplaints, quite honestly, will be done that way.\nMost people are not going to go into Federal court,\nespecially not if all they can seek is injunctive\nrelief and they have to pay a filing fee and it's going\nto take a long time to go there.\nNow, Mr. Whitman had two problems that made\nit unlikely he was going to go through the grievance\nprocess here. The first of these problems is that the\ngrievance process, as it sets -- as it's set out in the\njoint appendix, the two stages of which he has control\n-- and I can return in a moment to what happens after\nthat. But the two stages at which he has control are\nto talk to his supervisor and to talk to the facility\nmanager.\nWhen it comes to drug testing of the kind to\nwhich Mr. Whitman was subjected here, his supervisor\ndoes not have authority over that. It's done from\noutside the facility. So talking to his supervisor\nwill not get him anywhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that simply means\nthat the grievance procedure is more valuable in this\ncase than merely talking to his supervisor. And -- and\nthe -- the issue -- maybe -- maybe we're missing it,\nbut the issue is why isn't there a very good reason to\nrequire him to go through the grievance procedure,\nnumber one, to -- to cut down on needless Federal court\nactions and, number two, under the -- sort of the\ngeneral policy of favoring what collective bargaining\nagreements negotiate.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, if his union had\nnegotiated a collective bargaining agreement that\nrequired exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to\nmake him go through it, but they didn't do that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but -- no -- no\nquestion. That would be an easier case. But why\nshouldn't we require an exhaustion for those two\nreasons and maybe others?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, if I could go through the\ngrievance process, I think you'll see why this\ngrievance process cannot be turned into an exhaustion\nprocess without this Court, in words that Justice\nGinsburg used last week, inserting a lot of carets into\nthe statute.\nThat is, there are two stages of this\ngrievance process over which Mr. Whitman has control.\nHe can go to his -- his supervisor in an informal\nconversation. There will be no factfinding. There is\nno right to call witnesses. There is no right to\npresent evidence.\nIf he doesn't like that -- and he has only 15\ndays to do it -- he can then appeal to the -- to the\nsupervisor of the facility. Again, he has no right to\npresent evidence. He has no right to any kind of\nfactfinding. He has no right to a reasoned decision.\nThose are the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He may not have any right to\nit, but in fact, he may get some relief.\nMS. KARLAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The union may say, okay,\nwe're going to take this one up.\nMS. KARLAN: They may and I'll turn to that\nin just a moment, but let me add one more thing to the\nanswer I was giving a moment ago to Justice Ginsburg,\nwhich is one of the problems here is that our client\nalleges in his supplemental complaint that when he\nfirst complained about this, he was singled out yet\nagain for retaliatory testing. And so this is\nprecisely the kind of case in which someone who is\nbeing subjected repeatedly to retaliatory tests would\nbe worried.\nNow let me turn to the question of --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Ms. Karlan, let me\nput one other element in here. Was -- was your client\nspecifically told by the FLRA to bring a grievance\nunder the collective bargaining agreement?\nMS. KARLAN: He was -- he wasn't told. He\nwas advised by someone who said the FLRA has no\njurisdiction here because this isn't an unfair labor\npractice. Now, of course, what the Government wants\nhim to do is to exhaust by going back to the FLRA which\nhas already told him that it has no expertise on this\nmatter.\nSo let me turn to that third stage of the\ngrievance process now, which is now he invokes\narbitration, or at least he asks his union to because\nunder section 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) of the statute, only\nthe union can invoke arbitration. Now, this Court\nnoted, as long ago as Vaca against Sipes, that unions\ninvoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of\ncases, so that in Vaca against Sipes, it was 1 out of\n900.\nThere was a recent study, the most recent\nstudy I could find that was published, about Federal\nGovernment employees, dealt with civilian employees of\nthe Army, and it looked at how often did the 31\ndifferent unions that represent civilian employees of\nthe Army actually invoke arbitration vis-a-vis the\nnumber of grievances that were filed. And it found\nthat in the years it looked at, no more than 6 percent\ngot arbitration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't the thing to\ndo here -- I -- I see that you are raising a\nsignificant question in respect to -- at least in my\nview, in respect to the -- an action that violates a\nregulation that violates a statute. Leave the\nConstitution aside, but it might violate a number of\npractices, good practices, et cetera. But why isn't\nfocusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do\nis he goes to the union -- I'm just reading from page 6\nand 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to\ninvoke arbitration? And they might do it. Now, if\nthey do it and it comes out a way they don't like,\nhe then -- they might file exceptions and they might\nwin.\nBut what you're worried about is if they\ndon't win or if they don't do it, they can go to court\nonly if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major\nadverse personnel action. That's what's worrying you,\nI take it.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't it, at that\nstage if he doesn't get into court, you then say that\nthat isn't true? They should be able to come to court\nin other instances as well, making the same kinds of\narguments that you're making now.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, there are two reasons for\nthat I think.\nOne is he suffers an irreparable bet-the-farm\ninjury every time he's searched unconstitutionally.\nThe second is that the statute simply doesn't\nsay that. I can understand -- honestly, I can -- why\nthis Court is in favor of exhaustion requirements. And\nif the statute contained one, it would be eminently\nsensible for you to apply it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You -- you -- I -- I believe\nthat there are millions of instances, perhaps. Now,\nI'm -- when I think something like this, I'm quite\noften wrong. But I thought that the reason that\nexhaustion is required is not always because statutes\nrequire it. It's partly because of the word final in\nthe APA, which applies here as well, and it's also\nbecause of the common law of administrative law that\nrequires people to exhaust their remedies.\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely, and I think if you\nused this Court's opinion in Madigan against McCarthy\nas your template for thinking about whether to impose\nan exhaustion requirement here, because I think, quite\nfrankly, that's what you would be doing -- you would be\nimposing one that doesn't exist now.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the -- the --\nMS. KARLAN: The Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the whole right to -- to\ngo into court with a constitutional claim is absent\nfrom the statute. And -- and so we may as well get\nhung for a sheep as a lamb. If -- if we're going to\nrecognize the one, I don't see that we're going too\nmuch further in -- in saying it's got to be conditional\non the other.\nMS. KARLAN: I -- I don't think so, Justice\nSouter, because I think this Court has traditionally\nallowed individuals who are bringing constitutional\nclaims for injunctive relief to seek that relief.\nNothing in the CSRA changed that, and if I can explain\nwhy for just a moment, I think it'll be helpful.\nIf you look at this Court's opinion in Fausto\nor you look at this Court's opinion in Bush against\nLucas or the opinion in Karahalios, which I think are\nthe three leading cases from this Court construing the\nCivil Service Reform Act in -- in this kind of fashion,\nyou'll notice that they repeatedly refer to those\nacts as being comprehensive with regard to personnel\nactions.\nPersonnel actions is not a casual phrase. It\nis a defined term in the CSRA. It's defined in section\n2302(a), which is -- was discussed in the Government's\nbrief at page 5, note 5. And you will notice there, if\nyou read it, that they do include -- indeed, Congress\nin 1994 amended the statute to add to the list of\npersonnel actions orders for psychiatric testing.\nThere was nothing here that turns a drug test into a\npersonnel action.\nNow, the CSRA is absolutely comprehensive in\nits field, but its field is personnel actions. And\nthis case is not a personnel action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the grievance procedure\ncovers it, and you took pains to point out to us that\nwhen you go to the grievance procedure, you're not\nnecessarily entitled to findings and -- and written\nconclusions, et cetera. But there's a reason for that.\nThe reason for that is that these things can be very,\nvery minor. So now you're saying that just because of\n-- the grievance procedure doesn't entitle you\nnecessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go\ninto court. But the only reason you don't get those\nfindings is because we know, going in, that they're so\nminor. So now the most minor things go to court. That\nseems very anomalous.\nMS. KARLAN: Justice Kennedy, all sorts of\npersonnel actions might be minor and they might be the\nkind of thing that the CSRA wants to have decided\nadministratively only or through exhaustion. This is a\nFourth Amendment violation. It is not minor. As this\nCourt held in Von Raab, the only thing that makes this\nkind of test constitutional --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have to interrupt you.\nWhat is the Fourth Amendment violation?\nMS. KARLAN: The Fourth Amendment violation\nhere is this Court said that warrantless, suspicionless\ndrug testing of Federal employees is acceptable only if\nit has safeguards that ensure that there is no\ndiscretion exercised in the field and that it's truly\nrandom.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand, the\nallegations are that there was random procedure in\neffect, and he thinks maybe he's been tested more\nfrequently than some other people. That's all.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. He alleges that\nthey are not, in fact, following the random procedures,\nthat instead, when it's more convenient for them to\ntest him -- and I can understand why they want to test\nhim. Every time they test him he passes the test. So\nwhy not ask Mr. Whitman who is a compliant, sober\nemployee, if you need another person to just round out\nthe numbers to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but as I understand\nit, the -- the system as a whole is not challenged as\nviolating the Fourth Amendment.\nMS. KARLAN: No. The operation of the\nsystem, as it applies to Mr. Whitman in Anchorage.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: By having him take more\ntests than would be produced by a purely random\nselection.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. And then by\nretaliating --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Have we ever said that's a\nFourth Amendment violation?\nMS. KARLAN: Of course it is, because you\ncan't conduct a random --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the computer\nmalfunctions, that's a Fourth Amendment violation?\nMS. KARLAN: No. And if the Government --\nthe Government in its answer in the district court does\nnot say there was a computer malfunction. They say we\ndon't really even keep records back as long as he --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the relief that he\nrequested was to do a little more testing to see\nwhether he was being tested more than the average\nperson, as I understand it.\nMS. KARLAN: Well -- well, yes. Of course,\nhe was proceeding pro se in the district court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is not -- did not\nseem to me to be alleging a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.\nMS. KARLAN: No. He -- he did. He said it\nis not random, and then in his supplemental complaint,\nhe alleged that he was retaliated against for\ncomplaining the first time around and was selected out\nwhen he wasn't on the list to be tested yet again.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, if this\nis indeed serious, are you sure that it's not a\npersonnel action?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is a residual category\nin the definition of personnel action which says, any\nother significant change in duties, responsibilities,\nor working conditions. That's the residual category.\nBut one of the specifically named categories,\nbefore you get to that, is a decision to order\npsychiatric testing. Now, if that kind of a decision\ncould be a personnel action, why couldn't a decision to\nconduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a\npersonnel action?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, two answers to that. One\nis the fact that Congress -- in 1978 they first gave\nthe entire list of personnel actions. In 1994, they\namended that list to add psychiatric testing. This is\nafter the Government has already been engaged in urine\ntesting of Federal employees. If they wanted to say\ndrug testing, they would have said it. And for you to\nadd that is really --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not adding it. There's\na residual category at the end: or any other\nsignificant change in duties, responsibilities, or\nworking conditions. I consider this -- you consider it\na significant change in working conditions.\nMS. KARLAN: With all respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he thought he didn't\nhave to undergo drug testing, and what do you know?\nHe's being picked on for drug testing all the time.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, with all respect, Your\nHonor, I think you would have to overrule the Fort\nStewart School against FLRA case that the Court decided\nin 1990 to define working conditions to include a drug\ntest because there -- and it's cited at page 28 of the\nNTEU's brief -- the Court says that the term, working\nconditions, refers to, quote, circumstances or states\nof affairs attendant to one's performance of a job.\nNow, drug testing is not attendant to his\nperformance of his job. It is the condition of his\nholding the job in some sense that he pass the test.\nAnd if he failed that test, he would, indeed, have to\ngo through the CSRA. But because he passed the test,\nhe has no way of getting into court.\nNow, if I could turn --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why then would a decision to\norder psychiatric testing qualify? Because it says, or\nany other. Right?\nMS. KARLAN: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Significant change in\nduties, responsibilities, or working conditions. The\nimplication is that a decision to order psychiatric\ntesting is a significant change in duties,\nresponsibilities, or -- or working conditions.\nMS. KARLAN: But if the -- but if Congress,\nJustice Scalia, had thought that that catchall phrase\ncovered psychiatric tests, it would not have amended\nthe statute in 1994 to add them specifically.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's always good to be safe.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, yes, and it's good for the\nFAA to comply with the Constitution. And that's why we\nthink he should be allowed to go to Federal court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan,\nyou have a -- a statutory claim that essentially\nmirrors the constitutional claim. The statute requires\nthe testing to be random and impartial. If we think\nthere's a difference between the constitutional claims\nand statutory claims with respect to their treatment\nunder the CSRA, how do you handle that? Does he have\nto exhaust the statutory claim but not the\nconstitutional one?\nMS. KARLAN: I don't think that there would\nbe a difference with respect to exhaustion on those two\nclaims. The Government simply says he can never get\nreview of the statutory claim. So I don't think anyone\nhere is arguing that there should be a differential\ntreatment with respect to exhaustion. It's with\nrespect to whether you can get into court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you agree with\nthe Government on that, that he can never get review of\nthe statutory claim.\nMS. KARLAN: Oh, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, well.\nMS. KARLAN: We spend rather a bit of time in\nour brief explaining --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't -- don't appeal\nto them on a -- on a point on which you don't agree\nwith them. I mean --\nMS. KARLAN: What can I -- what can I say?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still don't\nunderstand how they proceed. Does he have to bring --\ncan he go right into court on the constitutional claim\neven if the statutory claim has to go through the\ngrievance procedure?\nMS. KARLAN: The answer to that would be yes.\nHe might end up being precluded, if he lost in Federal\ncourt on the constitutional claim, from coming back on\nthe statutory claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the identical\nclaims have to proceed under two different routes.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We don't think\nthere is exhaustion required with respect to either set\nof claims.\nIf I may, I'll reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAlthough Congress has not clearly expressed\nan intent to foreclose all judicial review of\npetitioner's constitutional claim, such review should\nbe conducted in a manner that is as consistent as\npossible with the text and structure of the CSRA.\nBecause petitioner failed to invoke the grievance\nprocedures of the applicable collective bargaining\nagreement, his suit was properly dismissed.\nAnd if I may, just in a -- a moment or two,\nsummarize the Government's position as to the steps\nthat an individual in petitioner's position would have\nto take in order to obtain judicial review of a\nconstitutional claim like this one.\nFirst, the employee must make all reasonable\nefforts to utilize the available administrative\nremedies under the CSRA itself, including any\napplicable collective bargaining agreement. So in this\ninstance, the first two steps of the grievance process,\ntalking to the immediate supervisor and then to the\nfacility manager, would have been within petitioner's\ncontrol. And if those steps had proven unavailing,\npetitioner should have requested that the union take\nthe case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the\nFLRA.\nSecond, if at the end of the administrative\nprocess an avenue of judicial review is available under\nthe CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant\nto that provision.\nAnd I think petitioner really concedes that\npoint to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a\nconstitutional challenge to a major adverse action,\nsuch as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he\nwould have been required to exhaust administrative\nremedies by -- by appealing to the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we\n-- he would have had to seek judicial review in the\nmanner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a\npetition for review of the MSPB's decision in the\nFederal Circuit, rather than proceeding directly to\ndistrict court.\nAnd finally, our position is that if at the\nconclusion of the administrative process, judicial\nreview is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may\nthen obtain review of his constitutional challenge\nalone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative\nProcedure -- Procedure Act.\nNow, in some sense, there is an element of\nuntidiness in our position because what we're trying to\ndo is reconcile Congress' intent to adopt --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, can I just ask\none question? Because I didn't quite follow it. I\nthought you were describing a major personnel action in\n-- in your description of the administrative review.\nBut if this is a minor or whatever, a lesser review,\nwould there have been an avenue through the\nadministrative agency?\nMR. STEWART: There would have been, at least\nfor this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was\ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Through the collective\nbargaining --\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then supposing the\nunion is unwilling to grieve or take it up or he fails,\nthen what happens?\nMR. STEWART: If -- if he requests that the\nunion take the grievance to arbitration and then to the\nFLRA and the union refuses, our position would be that\nhe could then file suit in Federal district court under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act on his constitutional\nchallenge alone. That is, we think on the one --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it would be in the\ndistrict court.\nMR. STEWART: That would be in the district\ncourt --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, that is if -- if the\nunion doesn't agree to arbitration?\nMR. STEWART: That is if the union does not\nagree to take the case to arbitration and then to the\nFLRA. If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your difference --\nwhat's separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a\nquestion of timing. The action that you're describing\nthat would come at the end, after he's used the\nadministrative process, is the same one that he is\nseeking to bring at the front end. That is, it's a\n1331 action --\nMR. STEWART: I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and -- and it's based\non the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity for\nnonmonetary claims.\nMR. STEWART: It is in part one of timing,\nbut it's not one of timing alone. That is, our\nposition is if Mr. Whitman had been successful in\nprevailing upon the union to take the case to\narbitration and then to the FLRA, the position we've\ntaken in the brief is that judicial review, if the FLRA\nhad rendered an unfavorable decision, would most\nappropriately be accomplished in the court of appeals\npursuant to the CSRA.\nBut our position is if the union is unwilling\nto take the grievance to the point where the ruling can\nbe reviewed under the provisions of the CSRA itself,\nthat the APA remains available as a fallback.\nBut the -- the fact that it's one of timing\ndoesn't make it an insignificant difference. That is\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, you know, you\nhave here a statute in which Congress, with malice\naforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review\nof any major personnel actions and does not provide for\njudicial review of what it had regarded as\ninsignificant personnel actions. I can understand the\nposition, although I don't agree with it, that the\nconstitutional provision which says Congress can -- can\nmake exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal\ncourts should not be interpreted to exclude significant\nconstitutional claims. But when Congress has gone to\nthe trouble of providing for judicial review of any\nclaims that are significant and just saying any other\ninsignificant action, even though a constitutional\nviolation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact\nit does not harm you that much, we're not going to\nallow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with\nthat? It seems to me that's what Congress has said and\n-- and you're creating a scheme that simply contradicts\nwhat Congress plainly said.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, first, certainly if\nCongress had said with absolute clarity that district\ncourt review of claims like this is precluded, we would\ndefend the statute as constitutional.\nSecond, I agree with you that the fairest\nreading, the most likely interpretation of Congress'\nintent is that claims of this nature -- that is,\ncomplaints about aspects of the employment relationship\nthat don't rise to the level of personnel actions. The\nfairest reading of Congress' intent is that such suits\nwould be precluded.\nHowever, this Court in a number of prior\ndecisions has required something more than that before\ninferring that Congress has barred all judicial review\nof a colorable constitutional claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did any of them involve a\nsituation in which Congress took the pain to separate\nsignificant actions from insignificant actions?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, in some sense the CSRA\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, some of them involve\ndeportation and, you know, major -- major actions.\nThis is a case where Congress has -- has carefully\ntried to say these are major actions for which you\nshould be able to get into the courts. And these other\nthings -- you -- you have these administrative\nremedies, but that's the end of it.\nMR. STEWART: But I -- I think the flip side\nof it is that some of those cases involved statutes\nthat appeared on their face to function as express\npreclusions of judicial review. Here, we don't have\nthat. Here, the argument as to why Administrative\nProcedure Act review is precluded is not based on the\ntext of any CSRA provision standing alone. It's based\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm -- I'm not sure\nwhat the congressional intent would be to bifurcate the\nconstitutional and the statutory claims, especially if\nthey're the same thing.\nMR. STEWART: I don't know that there was\nnecessarily an intent to bifurcate, but I think we had\nthe same --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's what -- that's\nwhat you're asking us to say.\nMR. STEWART: I think the Court had the same\nsituation in Webster v. Doe. That is, in Webster v.\nDoe, the Court concluded that given the limits on\nreview of the CIA director's employment decisions and\ngiven the great sensitivity of hiring and firing\nmatters within that agency, the Court concluded that\nthere was simply no law to apply in review of the --\nthe claimant's complaint under the Administrative\nProcedure Act. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that\njudicial review of the constitutional challenge\nremained available.\nAnd the idea was not so much that Congress\nitself had manifested an intent to differentiate\nbetween the two types of claims. It was that Congress\nhad treated the two types of claims the same but that\nthe type of evidence that will suffice to eliminate\njudicial review of a non-constitutional claim is --\nit's less demanding than the type that the Court would\nrequire before eliminating judicial review of a\nconstitutional claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if -- under --\nunder your explanation of how the system works, you go\nto district court with a constitutional claim. He's --\nhe -- the district court doesn't have to reach the\nstatutory claim first?\nMR. STEWART: No. The statutory claim\nwouldn't be before the district court. Again, if -- if\nthe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's what I mean.\nThis is a very odd system where you have to immediately\ngo to the constitutional claim and you're foreclosed\nfrom looking at the statutory claim.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I agree that it's an\nunusual system, but I think it -- and in a sense the\nsame situation would have been present in Webster v.\nDoe, that is, the Court, when it came to review the\nmerits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn't have\nhad any possibility of deciding the case on a non-\nconstitutional basis because non-constitutional\nchallenges would be foreclosed.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position on\nthe statute was that it doesn't afford a right of\naction, that it was just an instruction to the\nSecretary. Maybe I misread your position on the\nstatute. We're talking about 45-1048?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nGovernment's position was there's no right of action\nunder that statute.\nMR. STEWART: There's no private right of\naction conferred by 45-108 itself. Now, in the\nordinary case, when a Federal statute places limits on\nagency personnel and a particular category of\nplaintiffs falls within the zone of interest that was\nintended to be protected by that provision, then even\nif the statute that limits agency discretion itself\ndoesn't provide a private right of action, the\nAdministrative Procedure Act would entitle a claimant\nto get into court and argue that the agency's decision\nwas contrary to law, namely the relevant statute. So\nif there were no question of CSRA conclusion, we would\nagree that the claimant could go into court raising a\nstatutory challenge notwithstanding the absence of a\nprivate right of action in 45-108 itself.\nHere, we think that the evidence from the\ncomprehensive congressional scheme is sufficient to\ndivest the courts of jurisdiction over the statutory\nclaim. We don't think that Congress has spoken with\nthe clarity that this Court has required to divest the\ncourts of jurisdiction over the constitutional\nchallenge.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, as to that, if -- if\nthere were a petitioner with some constitutional claim\n-- let's not get into the debate about significant or\nnon-significant -- covered by the collective\nbargaining agreement, you say the petitioner can't go\nto court with the constitutional claim unless he first\npersuades the union to seek arbitration.\nMR. STEWART: No. We're saying that he first\nhas to attempt to persuade the union to seek\narbitration. That is, he has to make all reasonable\nefforts to utilize the full range of administrative\nremedies. But it -- our -- our position is if the\nunion declines that request, then judicial review would\nbe available at the end of the day in Federal district\ncourt.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. Now, did you\nraise the exhaustion claim? Did the Government raise\nit in the lower courts?\nMR. STEWART: We didn't characterize it as an\nexhaustion argument. That is, the district court\nalluded to the petitioner's failure to exhaust in\ndismissing the suit. However, we -- this is not a case\nin which we have, up to this point, litigated the\nmerits of the Fourth Amendment dispute and then\nswitched to a threshold objection to adjudication.\nWe've always argued that the suit was barred by the\nCSRA scheme, and we've always pointed out that the\npetitioner did not take advantage of the administrative\nremedies that were available to him.\nReally, the only change in our position is\nthat we have been in the -- in this Court have been\nwilling to acknowledge that in the hypothetical case\nwhere someone in petitioner's position did make -- take\nfull advantage or make reasonable efforts to take full\nadvantage of the administrative processes, that\njudicial review would be available.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I guess\nyou're saying, as to the constitutional claim, it's\nobvious they have to exhaust.\nThere's no reason why they don't have to\nexhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already\noccurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be\nthreatened, if it does come about that it's threatened,\nthey can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask\nfor an injunction. Any reason they couldn't do that?\nMR. STEWART: Well, they would first have to\nget into court first. They would first --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What they do is\nthey follow, like any other agency action. An agency\naction has taken place. I think it's unconstitutional\nor you do. We exhaust our remedies and then get to\ncourt at the end of the day and make our claim.\nAn agency action is threatened. I am\nthreatened with irreparable injury. I can go to court,\nI think, at the time it's threatened, and say I want a\nprotective order. I think 705 provides for that\nspecifically. And -- and, therefore, I'm protected. I\ncan't imagine why they couldn't do that if they have a\n-- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it\ndoes violate the Constitution and they need the\nprotection. Is there any reason they couldn't?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I mean, again with the\ncaveat they would first have to avail themselves of the\nadministrative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, they wouldn't. Their\npoint is that the very -- availing myself of the\nadministrative remedy will work irreparable harm of --\nin violation of my constitutional right. Now, maybe\nthat's not true, but let's imagine it's true. Then\ncouldn't they go in and ask for a protective order? I\nthought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think you're --\nyou're correct that you could do that in the general\nrun of cases under the administrative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And is there any\nreason that they shouldn't be able to do that here?\nBecause they are going to say that -- I don't know they\never can make it out in this case, but they are going\nto say that my having to go ahead with the number --\ntest number 15, which, by the way, may never be\nthreatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I\nhave to do it, violate an important constitutional\nright that I need to have protected before undergoing\nthe text -- the test.\nMR. STEWART: No. In -- in our view, in\nharmonizing the -- the principle that judicial review\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: -- will ordinarily be available\nfor a constitutional claim with the remedial scheme\nestablished by the CSRA --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think they could not do\nthat under 705. So there is a difference between you\non that.\nAs to the statutory claim, I mean, I find --\nbut others may disagree with this. It's my personal\nview that the notion of private right of action in this\narea simply mixes things up. It's apples and oranges.\nIt has nothing to do with anything. That if a person,\nin fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a\nGovernment action, he usually, almost always, indeed,\ncan get judicial review eventually. But what you're\nsaying there I take it is that may be so, but this\nimpliedly says no.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, my question is do we\nhave to decide that. Because, after all, this\nindividual may get relief through the statutory\nprocedures that you admit are provided by asking for\ngrievance arbitration. He may, the first time he asks\nfor it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he\nwasn't hurt. Or he may have been hurt, and they'll say\nwe don't it again. There are a lot of things that can\nhappen.\nDo we have to decide the issue today of\nwhether if he goes to the union, the union says we\nwon't arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and\nit isn't as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to\ndecide that issue as to whether a person in those\ncircumstances can then subsequently go into court?\nMR. STEWART: No. I think you could\ncertainly decide the case on the ground that an\nindividual who has made no effort to utilize the\ngrievance procedures that are available under the\ncollective bargaining agreement, can't bypass those\nprocedures entirely by filing suit into -- in Federal\ndistrict court. And it wouldn't be necessary for the\nCourt to resolve --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have to say the easier\nmatter is it's clear that as to such matters, you must\nexhaust. It's so clear that there is no reason for us\nto decide whether there is an implied repeal of the\nright at the end of some days to -- to judicial review,\na matter which is disfavored in the law.\nMR. STEWART: Well, certainly to -- I mean,\nthat is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion\nrequirement, the Court would have to find that the --\nthe exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in\nthe CSRA.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I might. My -- so I don't\nknow why it wouldn't be.\nMR. STEWART: And I think that there's ample\nbasis for the Court to do that -- that is, one of the\nnoteworthy features of the CSRA is that the act\nauthorizes judicial review of a wide category of\nGovernment actions in different courts under different\ncircumstances. But there's no provision of the CSRA\nthat ever gives a plaintiff a right of immediate access\nto a Federal district court. That is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is -- is -- should\nit be a little bit of a concern to us that the lower\ncourt didn't address it? Should it be sent back to\nlook at this exhaustion notion?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think it's clear --\nit -- it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was\nadvised by the FLRA that the grievance procedure was\nhis available remedy and declined to invoke even the\ninitial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was on the view\nthat it was an exclusive remedy. The -- the statute is\nnot written in -- in any way as an exhaustion\nrequirement. It says you've got a minor grievance --\nissue. You go through the grievance procedure. There\nis no judicial review at the end of the line. So you\nwould be converting something that Congress wrote to be\nan exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.\nMR. STEWART: But I think -- I think that's\nwhy I said earlier that there was some element of\nuntidiness to our position. That is, we're not\ncontending that this was precisely the scheme that\nCongress envisioned.\nBut our -- our -- the Court's task, I\nbelieve, is to reconcile Congress' apparent intent --\nattempt to construct a comprehensive scheme that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- you have picked\none way to do that. You say go through the grievance\nprocedure. If there's a constitutional question\nremaining, if you haven't been satisfied, then you\nbring the action in court.\nAnother way to say is, well, as long as we're\nmaking this up, why not allow the -- the action to\nproceed at once in court, but then the court to say,\nI'm going to abstain while you go through the grievance\nprocedure.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I mean, I guess we would --\nwe would resist the notion that we're making it all up.\nThat is, whenever Congress -- whenever this Court\nattempts to harmonize two distinct statutes to make\nthem -- in order that they would make sense taken\ntogether, the result is likely to be that neither\nstatute will be read in precisely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the second statute?\nThere's no second statute here. There -- there is your\nconcession of the fact that there has to be judicial\nreview. That's what's driving all of this. And -- and\ngenerally speaking, when we find something to be\nunconstitutional, we don't rewrite a statute so that it\nwill be constitutional. We just say, you know, there\nhas to be judicial review.\nMR. STEWART: There is a -- a second statute,\nand it's the Administrative Procedure Act, which would\ngenerally allow an individual who is aggrieved by\nFederal Government action to file suit in court. And\nthe question is whether Congress has manifested with\nsufficient clarity its intent to divest the court of\njurisdiction under the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, if you assume\nthe APA is the remedy -- we're talking about a district\ncourt procedure -- how would you describe the final\nagency action that would be challenged in that lawsuit?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, it really depends upon\nthe extent to which -- it really depends on where the\nadministrative procedures go. That is, the APA is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let's assume that the -- he\nseeks a grievance, and the union refuses to grieve.\nAnd then he then goes into -- into district court under\nthe APA. What would the final agency action be in your\nview?\nMR. STEWART: The final -- it's -- it's a\nlittle bit hard to define. It would in some sense be\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Very hard to define.\nMR. STEWART: It -- it would in some sense be\nthe allegedly unconstitutional drug test that he's\nalready been required to take.\nOne of the things that makes this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So what would his relief\nbe? He can untake it.\nMR. STEWART: Exactly. And one -- one of the\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because he can't damages\nunder the APA.\nMR. STEWART: One of the things that makes\nthis tricky is that under this Court's decision of City\nof Los Angeles v. Lyons, if an individual is subjected\nto allegedly unconstitutional conduct but has no reason\nto believe that it will happen to him again and damages\nare unavailable, then the -- there is no standing to\nseek injunctive --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but here, that's\nnot this case because he said, and when I complained,\nthey did it again.\nMR. STEWART: That's right. And I think in a\nsense what you could say is the -- the agency action\nthat he would be complaining about in the APA suit is\nnot so much the past drug test, it would be the\nthreatened or ostensibly threatened drug test. And his\nbasis for believing that they were, in fact, likely to\noccur is that he had been subjected to unconstitutional\ndrug tests in the past.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's not a final\nagency action. The threat of another test isn't a\nfinal agency action, is it?\nMR. STEWART: I would certainly think that if\n-- if there were no question of CSRA preclusion, if we\nwere just looking at the APA standing alone, and an\nindividual said they've done this unconstitutional\nthing to me time after time, my supervisor has\nransacked my office time and again or FBI agents have\nshown up at my door every day and have insisted on\nsearching, I think even if damages were unavailable for\nthe prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say\nthe likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent\nthat a right of action should be available in court.\nAnd -- but again, I think all of these are\nperhaps potential alternative bases on which this\ncomplaint could have been dismissed, but it doesn't\nalter the fact that an adequate basis for dismissal was\nthe failure to invoke the grievance procedures\navailable under the CSRA and the collective bargaining\nagreement.\nAnd I think it's not simply a -- to say that\nit's simply a question of when the individual can file\nsuit is to presuppose that the grievance procedures\nwon't work. And there's no reason to assume that that\nwill happen. That is, Congress manifested -- Congress\nin the CSRA enacted congressional findings to the\neffect that collective bargaining and -- and union\nactivity in the public sector are in the public\ninterest. It specifically required that collective\nbargaining agreements under the CSRA should contain\ngrievance procedures for the resolution of disputes,\nand I think --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If the dispute were to go\nto arbitration -- there are very limited provisions for\njudicial review in the event there is a decision --\ncould the constitutional claim still go to court?\nMR. STEWART: The constitutional claim could\ngo to court, and what -- what we've sketched out in the\nbrief is two alternative routes for judicial review in\nthe event that the grievance was processed to its\nconclusion, that is, a finding by the FLRA.\nOn the one hand, it would be possible to\ninvoke the provision of the CSRA that specifically\nrefers to judicial review of FLRA decisions generally,\nand that provides for review either in the regional\ncourts of appeals or in the D.C. Circuit.\nHowever, it -- there is a difficulty with the\nstatutory language in the sense that that provision\nthat authorizes court of appeals review specifically\nexcludes FLRA decisions on grievances. And therefore,\nif the Court felt like that sort of tweaking of the\nstatutory language was just too much to tolerate, then\nthe available remedy would be in the Federal district\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right that the\nstatute as written says you don't have any judicial\nreview for these kinds of actions? You go through the\ngrievance procedure, win or lose. That's it. There is\nno judicial review.\nMR. STEWART: It doesn't say you have no\njudicial review. It -- the -- the provision that would\notherwise authorize judicial review in the courts of\nappeals of FLRA actions is made inapplicable to\ngrievance procedures.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute does not\nprovide for judicial review --\nMR. STEWART: Exactly, but the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as it does in the case\nof major actions.\nMR. STEWART: But the statute -- the CSRA\ndoes not say -- does not purport to divest the courts\nof the authority that they would otherwise have under\ndifferent statutes to adjudicate challenges to\nemployment decisions. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, if -- if we're\ngoing to tweak the statute, isn't the least possible\ntweak -- and perhaps not a tweak at all -- simply to\nconsider this a personnel action?\nMR. STEWART: If the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if a decision to order\npsychiatric testing can be one, why can't a decision to\nrequire drug testing be one?\nMR. STEWART: That -- that would be a\npossible tweak. I'm not sure if it would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's a tweak at\nall. It -- it just depends on -- on what you consider\nto be working conditions. And in -- in many contexts,\nwe've given the broadest possible interpretation to\nworking conditions.\nMR. STEWART: I think that would be a basis\nfor dismissal in this case. I was going to say I'm not\nsure whether that would solve the problem from\npetitioner's standpoint because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it would mean\nyou don't get into court at all then. Right?\nMR. STEWART: It would -- the -- the remedy\nfor a -- an alleged prohibited personnel practice --\nand, I think, an unconstitutional personnel action\nwould be a prohibited personnel practice under the\nstatute. The remedy for that is to complain to the\nOffice of Special Counsel. Now, if the Office of\nSpecial Counsel seeks corrective action with the Merit\nSystems Protection Board and the MSPB issues a decision\nunfavorable to the employee, then the employee, under\nthe terms of the CSRA itself, can seek judicial review\nof the MSPB's decision in the Federal Circuit. So\nthere would be a potential route --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even in the -- even\nif it's not a major personnel action?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, if -- again, if the OSC\nasked for a corrective action in the MSPB. Now, if the\nOSC processes the complaint and concludes either that\nthe factual allegations are unsubstantiated or that the\nallegations, even if true, wouldn't constitute a\nprohibited personnel practice and terminates the\ninvestigation on that basis, there's no avenue for\njudicial review under the terms of the CSRA of the --\nthe OSC's decision to dismiss the complaint. So I\nthink that the -- the route you've sketched out might,\nat the end of the day, lead to judicial review without\nany tweaking of the statute. But if the OSC dismissed\nthe complaint, we would still be left with the problem\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What their brief says is\nthat they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major\npersonnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint\nhas to do with whistleblowing.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And that --\nthat's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And this doesn't have to do\nwith whistleblowing.\nMR. STEWART: That -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, even if this\nwere a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not\nopen to them.\nMR. STEWART: That -- that is the position\nthat they've taken in the brief. The position of the\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that true? What do you think?\nMR. STEWART: -- the position of the OSC and\nthe Department of Justice is that OSC's jurisdiction\nover FAA employees is not limited to whistleblower\ncomplaints.\nNow -- now, it's clear that in the run of\ncomplaints, with respect to employees of other Federal\nagencies, I don't think there's any dispute between the\nparties that OSC's jurisdiction would extend beyond\nwhistleblower complaints. The -- the only point of\ndispute is with respect to the FAA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, let me just be\nsure I understand. In the Government's view, is it a\npersonnel action or is it not?\nMR. STEWART: No, it's not. And indeed, in\nfootnote 28 of this Court's decision in Bush v. Lucas,\nthe Court specifically identified warrantless searches\nas an example of conduct in which an employer might\nengage towards its employees that would not constitute\na personnel action. And we think that's good authority\nfor the proposition that an allegedly unconstitutional\ndrug test is not a personnel action.\nNow, if the employee had refused to take the\ntest and been dismissed or disciplined, that would be a\npersonnel action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in those circuits\nwhich allow these cases to go to courts, has there been\nany indication that the courts are flooded with a\nnumber of these cases or --\nMR. STEWART: Not -- no, not that I'm aware\nof. Obviously, in -- in other circuits, we prevailed\non the -- the theory that the CSRA precludes review\neven of constitutional claims.\nAnd again, if I could return just for a\nmoment to the -- the point I was making earlier about\nthe grievance procedure. Congress has clearly\nmanifested a preference for the inclusion of grievance\nprocedures in collective bargaining agreements, and --\nand given that express congressional preference, it\ndoesn't seem right for this Court to assume that the\ngrievance procedures won't work.\nAnd this seems to be an ideal example of a\ncase that potentially implicates constitutional issues\nbut that still falls squarely within the expertise of\nthe union, the arbitrator, and the FLRA. That is, the\ndispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was\ntested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so,\nwhat was the explanation? Was it simply random\ndeviations? Was it potentially a -- a glitch in the\ncomputer program that was used to generate a random\nlist of names, or was there some invidious motivation\nas -- as petitioner has suggested? The resolution of\nthose types of questions falls entirely within the\nexpertise of the participants in the grievance process\neven though constitutional law per se is not what labor\narbitrators are best at.\nAnd so, I guess to -- to return for a second\nto -- to Justice Scalia's question about why shouldn't\nthe CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of\nconstitutional claims altogether. I mean, we certainly\nthink that if -- in a sense, that's -- that's a debate\nwe would be happy to lose. That is, the Government has\nnot suggested that we have an affirmative interest in\npreserving judicial review of those claims, and if the\nCourt were looking for a -- the simplest solution to\nthe problem, that solution would be -- have just as\nmuch to recommend it as petitioner's solution, which is\nthat you go straight into Federal district court.\nHowever, we don't think that Congress has\nspoken with the degree of clarity that this Court's\ndecisions demand to preclude all judicial review of\nconstitutional challenges, and we think the best way of\nreconciling that presumption of judicial review with\nthe comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to\nprovide that claims -- constitutional claims are\nreviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all\nreasonable efforts to utilize the available\nadministrative remedies.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\nMs. Karlan, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KARLAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI -- I think it's clear at this point that\nthe Government really is asking this Court to rewrite\nthe CSRA on the fly. As late as page 48 of their brief\non the merits, they wouldn't tell us whether our client\nshould go to Federal district court or to the court of\nappeals. Then in response to Justice Scalia's\nquestion, they say, well, you could rewrite\n2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) and (x). And I think the CSRA is a\nsufficiently detailed and comprehensive statute that\nthis Court has resisted rewriting several times.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's not rewriting. I\nmean -- I mean, it's perhaps.\nMS. KARLAN: It is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think --\nfine.\nThe -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems\nthat could be dispositive of this, in respect to the\nnon-constitutional claims -- and this is why I want to\nget your response -- is simply that it is a fair\nimplication from Congress having set up on non-\nconstitutional matters a system of arbitration to\nrequire your client to go through that system before\nseeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters\nin a Federal district court. Now, that's the normal\nrule in administrative law. What is the argument that\nit wouldn't apply in your case?\nMS. KARLAN: That the system of collective\nbargaining negotiated grievance processes here is set\nup in a way that does not filter it into judicial\nreview. And therefore -- in 1994, when Congress\namended section --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now you want us to hold you\ndon't have judicial review --\nMS. KARLAN: No, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- under the statute.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Your Honor. We think that\nthat goes straight under the APA.\nNow, here's the real problem with the\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but the answer --\nplease, I didn't mean to cut off your answer.\nMS. KARLAN: I know.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to hear your answer\nto the question that if I agree with you that on non-\nconstitutional matters, if this system doesn't work for\nyour client, he gets review in a Federal district\ncourt. Suppose I agree with you on that. What is the\nargument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy\nthat is there, namely a request for arbitration --\nMS. KARLAN: The argument against it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- as an implication from\nthe statute?\nMS. KARLAN: The argument against it in this\ncase, which stems, from among other things, this\nCourt's decision in Zipes against TWA and in Heckler\nagainst Day, is the Government waived any claim that\nour client should have been required to exhaust. They\nnever raised that issue below, and this Court has\nrepeatedly held that a failure to raise a non-\nexhaustion defense is waiver of that defense. You\nshould wait until you have a case where there has been\nbriefing and factfinding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there\nany other claim -- any other answer to the argument\nother than they waived it?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMS. KARLAN: And that is that when Congress\namended 7121(a) in 1994, they amended it to make clear\nthat it had no effect on judicial causes of action that\narose from elsewhere. That's what the insertion of the\nword administrative there was done. It was not done in\norder to create an exhaustion regime, but rather, to\neliminate a preclusion regime. And we set this out\nquite carefully in our brief, as do the two union\namici, as to what the purpose of the grievance\nprocedure is here. It is not to create an exhaustion\nregime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime\nwith what the Government, at least, concedes under the\nstatute, as now written, is not a personnel action.\nThat is, the CSRA is quite comprehensive with\nregard to personnel actions, but it leaves to\ntraditional sources of judicial enforcement things that\nare not personnel actions. And as this Court's opinion\nin Bush against Lucas makes absolutely clear, a\nwarrantless search of the kind to which our client was\nsubjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is\nnot within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for\ndealing with personnel actions.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did I -- could you give --\ngive the same answer --\nMS. KARLAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in respect to your\nconstitutional claim? Why, given the presence of\nsection 705 of the act --\nMS. KARLAN: Well, we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- one's -- forget it.\nMS. KARLAN: Oh, oh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your time is up. That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I get to say that.\nYour time is up.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you, both.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
