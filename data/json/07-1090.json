        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 07-1090, Republic of\nIraq v. Beaty, and the consolidated case.\nMr. Franklin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nActing with express statutory authority and\nin furtherance of important foreign policies following\nthe fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President\nmade inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of\nlaw that had applied to countries that sponsored\nterrorism.\nUnder the plain language of the statute,\nthose provisions included former section 1605(a)(7),\nwhich was a provision of law that applied only to such\ncountries. Because section 1605(a)(7) was made\ninapplicable as to Iraq effective on the President's\ndetermination, it cannot now serve as the applicable\nstatutory basis for abrogation of Iraq's foreign\nsovereign immunity and therefore subject matter\njurisdiction in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Franklin, even if you\nare right about that, the legislation was an emergency\nmeasure with a sunset. It was revived for 1 year, but\nthen no more. So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack\nof immunity -- didn't the immunity come back? Didn't\nthe bar to immunity come back again once the emergency\nlaw sunsetted?\nMR. FRANKLIN: No, Your Honor. The language\nof the sunset provision to which you are referring\nstates only that the authorities contained in the\nsection would expire. That means the authorities to the\nPresident given to him to act. Congress did not say\nthat the effect of what the President had done would be\nnullified once his authority to act had expired.\nAnd it's important to recognize that the\nPresident not only made inapplicable provisions of law\naddressed to state nations that had sponsored terrorism,\nbut he also suspended the Iraq Sanctions Act under the\nsame authority. The Iraq Sanctions Act has never been\nrepealed.\nSo, if it were correct that the -- that the\n-- everything that the President had done became\nnullified upon the expiration of his authority to act,\nthen the Iraq Sanctions Act would not only currently be\nin effect today, but would have been in effect since\nSeptember 30th, 2005. And if there's -- that is not\nwhat Congress intended. The Iraq Sanctions Act has a\nhuge panoply of sanctions, both dependent on and\nindependent of the legislative determination of Iraq as\na state sponsor of terrorism.\nBut if there's any question about this, when\nCongress acted again, the same Congress acted in 2003 to\nextend the expiration date, Congress -- the -- when that\nCongress acted, the legislative history said quite\nexpressly that the extension was not necessary to extend\nwhat the President had already done, because that had\nalready happened and that was permanent. But it was\nnecessary according to Congress for other reasons.\nSo both because of the plain language of the\nsunset provision and because of what Congress\nsubsequently did in 2003 to extend it, as well as the\ninterpretation of the United States on this point, the\nPresident's actions didn't sunset. It was emergency\nlegislation to be sure, but the emergency was to give\nthe President the authorities. We were at war at that\ntime and our foreign policy was changing 180 degrees\nalmost overnight away from penalizing the government of\nSaddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism, as an\noutlaw regime, and immediately towards helping the\npeople of Iraq.\nAnd Congress gave the President the broad\ncatch-all authority to, if he deemed it appropriate, to\nrelieve the people of Iraq from all, not just some, of\nthe very onerous restrictions and disabilities that had\napplied to them as a result of the prior regime's\nsupport for terrorism.\nThe President did this in exercise of his\nforeign policy judgment in order that the people of Iraq\ncould better rebuild their country and establish a new\ndemocratic government that would in fact prove to become\none of the United States' most trusted allies in a\nregion that has not always had very many of them.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you make of\nthe fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was\nnever its intention, it was never its intention for the\nPresident to have the authority to -- to do this?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Two things, Justice Alito:\nThe -- the first point is that this was not the Congress\nthat acted in 2003. This was a subsequent Congress.\nAnd that statement occurred almost 5 years after the\nlegislation had been enacted and almost 3 years after\nthe President's authority to act had expired. As such,\nthat statement is nothing more than subsequent\nlegislative history that cannot be determinative in\ndeciding whether the President acted validly in 2003.\nThat determination should be judged according to the\nstatute that was in front of the President when he\nacted.\nBut if there's any question at all in the\nCourt's mind about the application of that provision,\nthe President waived it. He waived its application as\nto Iraq. It is important to remember that the President\nwould not sign the version of the NDAA that just had\nthat provision in it. He vetoed the bill. He vetoed it\nonly because of its effect that it might have on Iraq,\nand he would not sign a replacement until he was given\nthe authority to waive any and all of the provisions of\nsection 1083 to the extent they may affect Iraq. So if\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Including -- including\nthe provision that repealed 1605(a)(7). So that would\nbe revived?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, we don't agree with\nthat, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the\nwaiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive\napplication of extant provisions of law to the extent\nthey might affect Iraq. The President wasn't given the\nadditional power to reenact statutes, to put a repealed\nstatute back on the book. The waiver was just like the\nEWSAA waiver, where the President was authorized to\nwaiver with respect to Iraq existing privileges --\nexisting provisions of law. But again, to the extent\nthere is any question about that, Title 1, U.S.C.\nsection 108 answers that conclusively. That section\nprovides that even if Congress itself had repealed\nsection 1083 in its entirety, that would not bring\nsection 1605(a)(7), which had been repealed by that\nsection. And that is the plain language of 1 U.S.C.\n108. Obviously the President by exercising a blanket\nwaiver authority can't have a better or more effective\nability to bring back into existence expired statutes\nthan Congress itself could have done.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because technically it's\njust suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment. I\nsuppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival,\nbut the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, we are talking here\nabout a waiver applied to a repeal. I think the\ntemporal point here is that the repeal happened\neffective upon the President's signature of the NDAA, on\nJanuary 20, 2008. That was already done. The repeal\nhappened. At that point, section 1605(a)(7) no longer\nexisted. It was not in the U.S. Code.\nThe President was authorized then\nsubsequently to waive existing provisions of law. And\nhere I think that this -- to allow the President to\nre-enact statutes according to a waiver authority is\ncontrary I think to 1 U.S.C. section 108, but also\ncommon sense as well. He was -- he was allowed to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I agree.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any other\ninstance in which a jurisdictional provision is\nwithdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress\nhaving mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think the closest\nanalogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the\nprecise circumstances we have here, and that is the\ndoctrine of foreign sovereign immunity. Prior to the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, determinations\nupon foreign sovereign immunity were made by the\nexecutive, and they had the effect, as the Court stated\nin the Republic of Mexico case and the Ex parte Peru, of\nrequiring the courts to, quote, \"surrender their\njurisdiction,\" even if it had previously attached.\nSo here we have the precise situation that\nhad always happened. It had always been this way prior\nto the FSIA. The President had always been able to make\ndeterminations on foreign sovereign immunity that would\nhave the immediate effect of divesting the courts of\ntheir ability to hear cases. Now, there were of course\njurisdictional provisions at the time that conferred\njurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, and the Court had\nno trouble -- and this was 150 years of practice, dating\nfrom Chief Justice Marshall's first recognition of\nsovereign immunity up until the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act.\nSo this is actually not any different really\nthan what had occurred before. We have also cited\nnumerous or several examples of jurisdictional statute\nthat do depend on executive determination. So there's\nreally nothing particularly unusual about that as well.\nI would like to turn at this point, if I\nmight, just briefly to our alternative argument in case\nthe Court might find it relevant. This is an\nalternative argument. It's not one that the Court needs\nto reach, but it is certainly another basis for reaching\nthe same result in this case. And that is the simple\nfact in 2008 section 1605(a)(7), regardless of what the\nPresident had done previously to it, was repealed. And\nit was not just repealed, but it was repealed with a\nsimultaneous bestowal of a replacement jurisdictional\nprovision that encompassed every single pending claim\nthat was then pending at the time.\nSo this is the classic example of a\njurisdictional repeal that applies to all cases.\nCongress didn't just repeal a statute, but it gave\nanother provision that encompassed every pending claim\nand allowed every single pending plaintiff to be able to\nrefile their cases.\nNow, to be sure, the plaintiffs against Iraq\nwere not able to exercise their ability under the new\nstatute -- that is 28 U.S.C. section 1605(A) -- but the\nonly reason they were not allowed to do that was the\nPresident's waiver, and the President's waiver was\nexpressly made applicable both to pending cases and to\npreexisting claims.\nSo, for both of those reasons the\nalternative ground is also one that warrants reversal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were there judgments,\noutstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments\noutstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on\nappeal?\nMR. FRANKLIN: There is at least two that I\nam aware of, two default judgments. They are cited in\nour brief. And the effective ability of those default\njudgment creditors, as it were, to execute on those\njudgments would depend on the application of the new\nstatutes that Congress enacted about judgment execution.\nThose are not at issue in this case. But the answer to\nyour question is yes, there were at least two judgments\nthat I am aware of that were default judgments where\nIraq had not appeared and did not contest the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you're not claiming\nthat those could be reopened?\nMR. FRANKLIN: We are not claiming in this\n-- in this proceeding they could be reopened. We're\nactually not claiming -- we haven't claimed in any\nproceeding that they can be reopened. But there is a\nserious question as to whether or not the plaintiffs\nwould be able to execute in the United States on those\njudgments. Also, they are default judgments and so they\nare subject to all of the usual rules to the extent\nabout reopening default judgments, not on the grounds of\nthis sovereign immunity issue, but on the normal grounds\nof reopening of default judgments. So, to the extent\nthere are such bases, I don't want to give up on those.\nBut we are not -- we are not making -- this\nargument's immunity argument today applies to these\npending cases and the ability of courts to enter\njudgments, not to existing default judgments, but the\nexecution on those judgments may well be affected by the\narguments we are making today.\nIn the final analysis, I think this -- this\nis a case that turns ultimately on the President's\nexercise of his foreign affairs powers as delegated to\nhim by Congress. The Court has traditionally given the\nexecutive a fair amount of leeway and deference in this\nfield. In this case I think that's particularly\nappropriate, given that these foreign policies are among\nthe most significant facing the United States today.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it your\nargument would be no different if this involved some\nother area. It doesn't depend upon the deference under\nthe foreign affairs --\nMR. FRANKLIN: No, it doesn't depend on it,\nbut I do think it's important to recognize that the\nPresident was acting in that -- in that field when he\nmade these determinations, and to also recognize that\nthese determinations -- the foreign policy of the United\nStates has not changed. It is still towards supporting\nthe people of Iraq and it's supporting the ability of\nthe people to rebuild their country and also their new\ndemocratic government, and all of those policies would\nbe thwarted or seriously disrupted if the Court were to\nhold that Iraq's sovereign immunity has been abrogated\nin these cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I also gather that the\nability of the President or the United States to seek\nsome compensation from Iraq through diplomatic channels\non behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by\nthis outcome, right?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nThat is the way that these kinds of claims have always\nbeen addressed in the past and these are the way that\nthese kinds of claims, particularly between friendly\nallies, ought to be addressed. And I would think that\nin this instance the Court in its Republic of Peru case\nprobably said it best and I'm just going to quote from\nthe last page of our brief. The Court said: \"Our\nnational interest will be better served in such cases if\nthe wrongs to suitors involving our relations with a\nfriendly foreign power are righted through diplomatic\nnegotiations rather than the compulsions of judicial\nproceedings.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is before the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?\nMR. FRANKLIN: That is true, but this case\ninvolve the doctrine of foreign immunity and it embodies\nthe same concerns of reciprocity that were at issue\nthen.\nIf I might, I would like to reserve the\nremainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nEWSAA section 1503 authorized the President\nto make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision\nof law that applies to countries that have sponsored\nterrorism. The terrorism exception to the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain\nlanguage of that authority. But if there were any\nquestion about that, certainly the President's exercise\nof his authority under that statute would be entitled to\ndeference.\nEven if one were to add the atextual\nadditional limitation that the Acree court majority\ntried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would\nstand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime\nin the aftermath of removing the Hussein government,\nstill the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear\nhis determination that the threat of billions of dollars\nof judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of\ntheir assets by attachment constituted an immediate\nthreat to the foreign policy interests of the United\nStates and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought we were just\ntold that because there -- of the limitations on\nenforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat\nto the Iraqi assets in the United States because the\njudgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is because of\nthe authorities that the President exercised under the\nsecond proviso of 1503. There are exceptions to the\nimmunity of foreign states with respect to attachment.\nThere is one that specifically applies to countries that\nhave been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and\nthat exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq\npursuant to this same authority.\nAnd so, again, it is essential to the\ngovernment's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these\njudgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in\nfact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were\nplaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the\nvery assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United\nStates Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in\norder to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the\nimmediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein\nregime. These critical foreign policy goals would have\nbeen frustrated had the President not been able to make\nour Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our\nforeign policy.\nAnd, of course, the Court in Altmann\nrecognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an\nexpression of our present foreign policy interests.\nThat has always been the case. And although Congress\ncan establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA,\nsection 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never\nbeen as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy\nwith respect to a country as happened in the spring of\n2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of\nsanctions and other provisions of law that had applied\nto Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of\nterrorism. On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted\n180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the\nsuccess of the new Iraqi regime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is all of this -- I\nwon't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if\nthe D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying,\nwell, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's\nno cause of action.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor.\nThe judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for\nfailure to state a claim was because counsel in that\nparticular suit was unable to identify a source of law\nfor their claim. The D.C. Circuit has correctly held\nthat Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of\naction under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when\npressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.\nBut numerous district court judgments exist\nwhere the courts have upheld the availability of\ntransitory tort under the law of the forum State, under\nthe law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the\nlaw of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to\nprovide a cause of action. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where the wrong occurred\nwould have been Iraq.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And\n-- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of\nlaw analysis. As I said, a number of these judgments\napply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff\nresided. The United States has expressed its view that\nthere are constitutional limitations on the ability of a\nState to project its substantive law to a tort that\noccurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I\ndon't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at\nleast.\nSo plaintiffs have successfully obtained\njudgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7). And there\nwere billions of dollars in claims that were asserted\nagainst Iraq. And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were\nactively going and trying to seek the actual money that\nthe United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to\npay immediate costs of the reconstruction.\nBut this does not mean -- and I think\nJustice Scalia's question was critical here. It does\nnot mean that the plaintiffs are left without any\nremedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on\nthe same footing as any other claimant against a foreign\nstate that is not on the very small list of designated\nstate sponsors of terrorism. Their claims are subject\nto state-to-state diplomatic resolution. And, in fact,\nthere have been discussions -- there are ongoing\ndiscussions -- to establish a framework for resolving\nthe claims against the Hussein regime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't any such\nsettlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the\nIraqi people themselves were the most numerous and\nprobably the worst victims of the terror?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\nthink that -- that that is one consideration. The\nUnited Nations has established a mechanism for funding\nmany of the victims of the Hussein regime. And -- and\n-- but the United States would have the obligation to\nrepresent the interests of the United States citizens\nthat were injured. But, as -- as Your Honor's question\npoints out, there are a lot of considerations that go\ninto the diplomatic or state-to-state resolution of the\nclaim beyond those that would be available to a court to\nconsider in just adjudicating the particular plaintiff's\nclaims. And that is why these have historically been\nreserved for diplomatic resolution. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't\ndoubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim\nthat could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity\nAct?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. No, I don't.\nAnd -- and Congress has established as a means to deter\nfurther acts of terrorism by states that have been so\ndesignated --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that claim could\n--\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- the abrogation\nof immunity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside the\nwaiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that\nthere has been a change in the governing authority in\nIraq?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. The\n-- the general rule that Congress established in\n1605(a)(7) was that the jurisdiction of the courts would\ncontinue for any claim that arose from acts committed\nwhile the state was designated. But the authority that\nthe President was given in 1503 was to render those\nstatutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq. And, of\ncourse, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold\nthat today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and\nauthority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to\n1605(a)(7). It would be application of that statute.\nSo the only way that one can give full\neffect to the plain language of the statute, \"make\ninapplicable,\" is to say that as soon as the President\nexercised that authority, 1605(a)(7) became\ninapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising\njurisdiction over Iraq.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that there\nshould be deference to what the executive did because of\nhis role in foreign affairs. But in the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew\nwhat had been the executive's traditional authority and\nsaid: President, no more; we are going to set rules of\nhow sovereign immunity will operate.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is true. And\nin 1503, Congress restored to the President in a sense a\nvery small portion of the authority he had previously\nexercised before the FSIA's adoption. 1605(a)(7) on its\nown terms turns on determinations by the executive.\nIt's a statute that can be turned on and turned off by\ndesignating or de-designating a country. It has a\nparticular temporal consequence, the rule that -- that\nthe Chief Justice alluded to.\nIn 1503, the Congress gave the President a\ndifferent authority to turn that statute off, the\nauthority to make it inapplicable only with respect to\none country, Iraq, and in the context of the most\ndramatic transformation of foreign relations that --\nthat could transpire.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Court will want to have available to it\nthe blue brief for the Petitioners and Joint Appendix\nVolume 2, which together reproduce the statutes that are\nrelevant to this case. And I do want to talk about the\ntext of the statutes.\nAnd the point that I'm going to make from\nthe text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General\njust correctly described to you what it was that\nCongress was trying to accomplish when he said that the\nstructure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by\na nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and\nthat designation changes so that you are no longer on\nthat list, then you still have a cause of action under\nthe FSIA. The fact that the country changes its ways\nand gets de-designated doesn't change that result.\nNow, what the Solicitor General says is that\nCongress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate\nin this case: Did Congress when it said that the\nPresident may make inapplicable various statutes which\nthey say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the\nbasic rule about what the effect of a designation and a\nrescindment of a designation was, or instead was it\ngiving the President a special power to remove the\ndesignation?\nIf all it was doing was giving the power to\nthe President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation\nas a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power\nrather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) \"except\nfor Iraq,\" if it's just a power about rescindment, then\nthe rule of 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just\ncited to you, that changing somebody's designation\ndoesn't affect their liability, would apply here. So\njust put it in terms --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why would -- why would\nCongress have wanted to make that distinction?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Let's -- let me take you to\nthe reason, and that is in Joint Appendix Volume 2.\nSection 620A of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is\nreproduced at 344. And this is the way that a\ncountry -- that a statute relating to torture and\nterrorism is made applicable and made inapplicable under\nordinary processes to a nation.\nSo to explain it to you, right now Syria,\nIran, and Sudan, this statute applies to them. It is\ninapplicable to Libya and North Korea. And the reason\nis that Libya and North Korea were originally designated\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a long section. Which\npart of the section --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I am going to take you\nstraight to the text. I am giving you the overview\nright now.\nSo, they were de-designated. It works in\ntwo parts. A is the prohibition. This is how you get\ndesignated. Prohibition. The United States shall\nnot --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Where are you?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry. I'm at 344, and I'm\nin A, prohibition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay, this is how you get\ndesignated: \"Prohibition. The United States shall not\nprovide any assistance under this Act\" -- this is our\nprincipal foreign aid statute -- \"the Agricultural\nTrade, Development, and Assistance Act of 1954, the\nPeace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945\nto any country\" -- and here's how you get designated \"if\nthe Secretary of State determines that the government of\nthat country has repeatedly provided support for acts of\ninternational terrorism.\" So we've designated Syria,\nIran, Sudan.\nNow, that designation can be rescinded and\nthat's usually what happens. But there are important\nrestrictions on the rescindment that gave rise to the\nenactment of section 1503, and they are in C, recision.\nThe Congress limited the President's ability to\nimmediately rescind the designation: \"A determination\nmade by the Secretary of State under subsection A not --\nmay not be rescinded unless\" -- and there are two rules.\nIt can happen in one of two ways. The first is you get\na new government: \"A, there has been a fundamental\nchange in the leadership and policies of the government\nconcerned.\" Or number 2, the old government changes its\nways. That's 2A: \"The government concerned has not\nprovided any support for international terrorism during\nthe preceding 6-month period.\nSo here's the dilemma and, Justice Souter,\nthis is the complete explanation for why Congress gave\nthe President the power it did in section 1503.\nRemember when the EWSAA is enacted there is a whole\ndiscussion in the first 30 minutes about the new regime.\nThere was no new regime. There was a discussion about\nhow the Saddam Hussein regime had been toppled. No, it\nhadn't.\nWhen the EWSAA had been enacted -- was\nenacted, Baghdad had fallen seven days earlier. There\nwas no new Iraqi government. We would not recognize an\nIraqi government until June of 2004.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may have\nnot been a new one, but there certainly was not the old\none either.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. But, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I'm making a very particular point, and that is\nthat the President lacked the power under this statute\nthat I have just cited to you, 620A -- and it is also\nthe statute that is cited in 1503 -- the President\nlacked the power at that time because there was no new\ngovernment and there wasn't a change in policy in the\nold government.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there's nothing better\nsettled -- well, perhaps that's broad. It is very well\nsettled that the President is the one to determine who\nis the lawful and legitimate government that he would\ndeal with.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's all that was\nhappening here. And it's not just a question of one\nagainst the other. It's a question of what government\nhas survived.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly right --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is under -- and\nunder the law something that has always been committed\nto the very large discretion of the President.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I couldn't agree with you\nmore, Justice Kennedy. And here's the relevant point.\nIn the spring of 2003 when Congress enacted this\nstatute, we had not recognized a new Iraqi government.\nWe did that in June of 2004. So my point is, and I\nthink this is very clear from the history, Congress\nenacted section 1503 of the EWSAA because the President\nwas powerless under the existing state of the law to\nrescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state. That's\nwhat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it was -- the text of\nit was not limited to rescinding that designation. I\nmean, that's the problem, it seems to me.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Well, let's go to the\ntext, if we could. And that is in the blue brief. It's\nin the appendix to the blue brief. And it's at 4A. And\nit's the second proviso, of course, and it appears seven\nlines down.\n\"Provided further, that the President may\nmake inapplicable\" -- that's the language that we are\ngoing to focus on, Justice Souter -- \"make inapplicable\nwith respect to Iraq\" -- and then it identifies the\nstatute -- \"section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act\nof 1961 or any provision of law that applies to\ncountries that have supported terrorism.\"\nNow, we are putting aside the debate of\nwhether section 1605(a)(7) is such a law. We are\nassuming it is and you say it, Justice Souter, but he is\ngiven the power to make inapplicable section 1605(a)(7).\nHe isn't just given the power to rescind the\ndesignation.\nAnd the question just -- the term \"make\ninapplicable\" doesn't appear in this context anywhere\nelse in the U.S. Code. We have to figure out what it\nmeans. And the way that laws that apply to countries\nthat have supported terrorism apply or are rendered\ninapplicable, there is a method in the U.S. Code for how\nthey are made applicable and inapplicable.\nSo, to return to my examples. If you were\nto ask the United States or Mr. Franklin -- so this\nstatutory scheme of laws -- sanctions that apply to\nnations that support terrorism applies to Syria, to\nIran, it applies to Sudan. It is inapplicable to Libya,\nNorth Korea, Guinea-Bissau, Britain, France. How is it\nthat they apply to some and not others? It's through\ndesignation. That's the process for taking something\nthat applies and make it inapplicable. And I can give\nyou a lot of other --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statute\nspecifically short-circuits that process. It says the\nPresident may at once make inapplicable. The very\npurpose of it is that the normal process is going to\ntake time, and therefore it's being replaced with an\nemergency measure that becomes effective immediately.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, the de-designation\nbecomes effective immediately. What -- the distinction\nthat I am drawing is that there is a strong version of\nthe words \"make inapplicable,\" and there is a more\nmodest version of the words \"make inapplicable.\"\nIraq and the United States say that when he\nmade it inapplicable he in effect essentially wrote it\nout of the U.S. Code or wrote in the exception that says\n\"except for Iraq.\" We say that \"make inapplicable\" in\nthis context is a term of art that deals with\ndesignation and rescindment. And that process is all\nthat Congress was trying to do, was to allow the\nPresident to immediately --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's -- let's\nassume --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- for the sake of argument\nthat the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and\nagainst the point you've just made are evenly balanced.\nWe are on the fence. Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't\nwe resolve this in favor of the President's position,\nsimply because in the absence of the statutes that we're\ntalking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act, the President would have had under the\nforeign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop\nsuits like this dead in the water simply by taking the\nposition that that should be the result? So that if in\ndoubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently\nwith the traditional foreign policy authority of the\nPresident, in which case we get off the fence and we go\nin the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I would say, no, because\nthat regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes,\nhas been profoundly changed by the enactment of the\nFSIA. We adopted a different --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's been profoundly\nchanged if we accept your argument. I mean, at the\nmoment the question is whether it has been profoundly\nchanged or not. We've got a statutory mess. And in a\ncase in which the statutes are seemingly subject to --\nto -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with\ntradition?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Well, I do want to\ncome to whether we are in equipoise in just a second. I\ndo think the fact that Congress changed the model so\nthat we don't use, in effect, the Tape Memorandum model.\nSecond, remember, Justice Souter, that this\nisn't a return to that model. What used to happen\nbefore the FSIA is the President would come into court\nand say I think that this nation has immunity and the\ncourt would decide on the basis of that case by case.\nBut it was the President making the determination, case\nby case. This is something unknown. This is very\ndifferent, if I could just explain how on their --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the President,\nquite apart from the immunity designation, the President\nhad the authority to compromise suits.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, fine, and if that is\nespousal power continues to exist, then the President\ncan attempt to exercise it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether it\ncontinues to exist or not for the sake of this argument,\nand I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of\nthis argument. I'm simply saying that if it is\notherwise unclear, given that that power was\ntraditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not\nconstrue the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to\nthat point, in the President's favor rather than your\nfavor?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So the -- two\nreasons, the first is this is not an attempt at\nespousal, unlike Dames & Moore and cases like that.\nRemember the President hasn't set up some sort of\nmechanism for resolving these claims. He is simply\nsaying that they are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he hasn't set it up\nbecause he thinks he has got the authority under this\nstatute or had the authority under this statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, it wouldn't\nwork like that. If the President were engaging in an\nact of espousal then he would have set up some mechanism\nfor resolving the claims.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I -- I quite agree with\nthat.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: So can I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So I suppose the first step\nin that direction is to stop the suit that's going on\nnow.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the President\npurported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six\nyears ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I\nthink he would have.\nBut can I just then just come to the premise\nof whether we are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why shouldn't\nwe treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct said Congress is setting the rules. But why doesn't\nthis emergency measure effectively restore to the\nPresident under these special circumstances the power\nthat he once had? Congress ceding back to the\nPresident back to the President for the purposes of\ndealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control\nauthority he once had?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So let's -- if I\ncould accept the premise that -- and not try to combat\nthe premise of what we would do in the case of\nequipoise, let me turn to the question of what statute\nreally means and why we shouldn't be in equipoise. The\nCourt generally has not assumed that emergency\nappropriations measures issues, particular their\nprovisos, changed the jurisdiction of the Federal\ncourts, much less give the President the power to change\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal courts. And it has in\nrelated context taken language like \"any provision\" and\nsaid well, we are looking for a clear statement of law\nby Congress to make sure it has confronted this\nsituation.\nWhen it attempts to -- when the argument on\nthe other side is that the Congress has passed a law\nthat shifts the balance of power between Congress and\nthe legislature and the executive in cases like\nAtascadero, in cases like Raygor, Will, these are all\ncases that had said statutes that said \"any,\" and the\nCourt said well, because this a -- a relatively strange\nthing to provide in the proviso to an appropriations\nmeasure, for example, we would ask that there be a clear\nstatement. So that would be one reason that we are not\nin equipoise.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But as a practical matter,\nisn't this closely associated with appropriations and\nwith foreign aid? The issue is billions of dollars were\ngoing to be needed to reconstruct Iraq in -- in the wake\nof the war and the money could be provided directly by\nthe United States through foreign assistance, which is\npart of the thrust of -- of this provision, certainly.\nAnd the argument is that this is closely related to it,\nbecause it freed up other money that would be used for\nreconstruction. So why is there anything odd about this\nbeing in an appropriations provision?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because this -- well,\nbecause what Congress was doing was confronting an\nemergency. There is not a breath, in either the\nPresident's transmittal of the statute, the legislative\nhistory of the statute, or anything else that says that\nCongress was dealing with the sort of medium to\nlong-term health of the Iraqi population or the Iraqi\ngovernment or the Iraqi economy. It didn't -- one thing\nyou would have expected if that was Congress's intent is\nthat Congress would have dealt with Iraq's debts, Saddam\nHussein's debts, and would you also suspect that this\nwouldn't sunset, which is the eighth proviso that hasn't\nbeen discussed never much.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why does it say then\nany other provision of law? You know, Congress could\nhave explained its more narrow purpose in a few words.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I mean, just to add to\nthat --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It said under 620A of\nForeign Assistance or any other provision of law.\nClearly they are going beyond, it seems to me, the --\nthe premise which your argument rests on, the argument\nthat you've just made.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, Justice Souter, I don't\nthink that that -- let me, if I could take the\ntwo points in turn. In cases like Atascadero, Will,\nRaygor, it's the same language; it's \"any.\" And the\nCourt has said we require a plain statement when\nCongress is going to do something that would change the\nbalance in the relationship between the branches of the\ngovernment or between the Federal and State governments.\nAnd Justice Souter, we don't deny it goes\nbeyond section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act; it\ngoes to other things that involve aid to the Iraqi\ngovernment. What it doesn't do is reach pending --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Fine. But there is\nno textual basis for drawing the line once you get\nbeyond 620A at the point you want to draw it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I actually do disagree and\nbelieve you can logically look at the statute -- in the\nsense that the word \"any\" means \"every,\" that is true.\nBut if you look at what Congress was trying to\naccomplish, it was much more focused on questions of the\nimmediate economic impact of the need to begin\nreconstruction in Iraq right away.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Goldstein, could I ask\nthis question? You are reading into it the exception,\nof the words \"any other provision of law.\" And I can\nunderstand your argument one of two ways, and I want to\nbe sure which. Are you saying it means any other\nprovision of the law, except those that affect the\njurisdiction of courts? Or are you saying any other\nprovisions of law that relate to foreign assistance?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I am saying that except for\nthose that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the\nkind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal\nwith correctly.\nThe answer to Justice Ginsburg's question in\nthe first 30 minutes is has this Court ever confronted a\nstatute and construed it to remove the jurisdiction of\nthe Federal courts without expressly saying so, is no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- I would like to\nfollow up on Justice Stevens's question. Think of three\ncategories, A is the category which you could see that\nother questions of law apply to. B, is this case, and\nC, is the other -- other things -- other things that it\nmight apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd\nto apply them to that. All right, what's in category C?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If it's anything, it would\nbe the export of military hardware. In the immediate\nwake of the fall of Baghdad, when there is no new\ngovernment, right? There is no replacement regime. If\nyou read \"any\" to mean literally \"every\" then you could\nship munitions, nuclear materials and the like when\nthere is no state there and it's silly to think that\nCongress intended that. Its reasons for enacting the\nstatute had to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. After Saddam\nHussein falls --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and we have a new\ngovernment --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't have a new\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yo mean some period of\ndays, or something?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who's paying for these\nshipments? I mean, is that a real problem when there is\nnobody over there to pay for them? You are worried\nabout -- about armaments producers shipping -- shipping\ngoods when there is nobody who has ordered them and is\ngoing to pay for them? I mean, that's absurd.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, it's not -- it's not\nentirely clear there is still a government in Iraq.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, is there any one\nother than that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think -- I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So basically, basically\nyour reading --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is the word \"any other\"\ndoes apply to any other.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Except your case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And possibly this thing for\na couple of days.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't exactly an\nabsurd result then, to say \"any other\" really means any\nother including this case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Breyer, in --\nthe same point was made in cases like Atascadero and\nRaygor. \"Any\" means \"every\" except for the States. In\nthat example.\nBut can I just make quite clear, we have two\nlines of argument. And I think it's important to\nrecognize that. We have the debate over what any other\nmeans and does that include section 1605(a)(7). That's\nwhat we have been discussing here, and the idea that any\nmeans every, and Congress spoke broadly and so that's\nwhat we have.\nBut we have the other incredibly important\narguments of what it means to make a sanction\ninapplicable. Which is separate and independent of that\npoint, and the question of whether the statutes sunset\nas the Acree court did. And I want to return First to\nthose point of what it is to make inapplicable a statute\nthat applies to nations that have supported terrorism.\nAnd I want to return to the statutory text and explain\nwhy our more modest reading of \"make inapplicable\" is\nthe right one.\nSo the statutory text again is at 4a. Here\nare, I think, the strong statutory indications that we\nare right, that what Congress was trying to do was to\nallow the President to immediately de-designate Iraq as\na terrorist state. First, there is a direct parallel\nbetween the language \"a statute that applies to\ncountries that have supported terrorism\" and the\ndirective that the President can make it inapplicable.\nThat tells you, look at how it is that these statutes\napply in the first place, and the linguistic term of art\nis to do the reverse. Take something that applies and\nmake it inapplicable.\nAnd something that applies to an -- statutes\napply to countries that have supported terrorism under\nAmerican law only in one way, through designation. And\nwhat happens is that the President was allowed to\nrescind it.\nThe second textual reason for our more\nmodest reading of make inapplicable is reference to\nsection 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act. So we know\none thing: even if we debate and disagree, Justice\nBreyer, about what any means in this context, we know\nthe Congress told the President he could immediately\nmake inapplicable section 620A.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why did -- why did he need\nthe statute to do that? In other words if the President\nhad the power to designate in the first place, normally\nthat assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right, but\nthat's the point. When I took you to the text of 620A,\nwhich was at 344 of the joint appendix volume 2,\nJustice Souter, he didn't have the power to do it right\naway. Remember, Baghdad falls; there is no new\ngovernment; and the old government hasn't changed its\nways. So he lacks the power to remove the designation.\nAnd I can prove that to you. It wasn't until there was\na new government that the President actually did\nformally rescind the designation pursuant to the Foreign\nAssistance Act. It wasn't until 2004. After --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- that's\njust a belt-and-suspenders act. I mean, he -- he has\nthe authority here, and he -- although it may look\ndifficult, he has to envision there may be people who\nchallenge that -- his interpretation of the law. So\nthere's the other provision that will make it\ninapplicable under that as well.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I disagree, but we will\naccept that. Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't, hey,\nlook, he himself acknowledged that he needed to exercise\nhis de-designation power. My point is different, and\nthat is the fact that he didn't do this under the\nForeign Assistance Act until 2004 is a strong indication\nthat he couldn't do it before. If he could have done it\nbefore, he would have.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it may also be an\nindication that he thought he had effectively\naccomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this\nstatute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I don't understand,\nJustice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new\ngovernment is recognized, suddenly decide to\nde-designate Iraq. There wasn't any -- the only --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't know, either.\nI mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an\ninterpretation that is quite possible consistent with\nthe text of this statute, that he thought that by acting\nunder 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do.\nWhy he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know,\nI'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't\nknow. But it would be consistent with the assumption\nthat he had the authority here.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, it -- I agree it would\nbe consistent with the assumption that he had the\nauthority here. That's -- I'm not trying to negative\nthat. What I'm trying to say is that the authority\nunder 620A -- the fact that he exercised it in 2004 is a\nstrong indication that that's -- it's not the only\npossible reading, but it's a strong indication that\nthat's when he thought he got the power. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Goldstein,\nbefore you finish your argument, I'd like to know what\nyou think about the claim for relief. The D.C. Circuit\nsaid this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it\ndoesn't provide a private right of action; the new\nstatute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq. So, what\nwas the source of the claim -- what is the source of\nthese plaintiffs' claim for relief?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The Solicitor General has it\nright. Post-Acree, these claims -- these types of\nclaims were pleaded principally as State-law claims, and\nthat has been recognized as providing a substantive\ncause of action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- which State law?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The State law generally of\nthe home State of the plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that -- by that\nreasoning, people all over the world could sue the\nUnited States in their courts alleging that the United\nStates has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with\nrespect to their nationals. The same theory would apply\n-- use the law of the state where the national comes\nfrom. So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be\nYemen -- any place. So -- but the claim you are saying\nexists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the\nUnited States could use it, any other place in the world\ncould, too.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that is clear -- well,\nin -- in terms of whether or not a foreign country would\nlook to our law and say, well, we're just doing the same\nthing as you do, that would arise from -- also from new\nsection 1605A.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Looking to their own\nlaw.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I understand,\nJustice Ginsburg. Section -- for example, section\n1605A, the statute that's created by the 2008 NDAA,\ncreates an affirmative U.S. cause of action. There is\nalways going to be an underlying domestic cause of\naction that underlies the FSIA, whether it's State law\nor instead it's Federal law. That is a -- a debate\nabout whether the FSIA is a good statute or not, but\nit's one that Congress has resolved --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. I mean, it's\nalso a debate as to whether the call on that question\nshould be a Federal one or a State one, whether -- there\nare all sorts of conditions attached to the -- the suits\nthat are allowed under 620A. And you are saying that,\neven without those conditions, any State -- Oklahoma --\ncan decide Americans can -- can sue foreign countries.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, the --\nthe source of the underlying cause of action is not\npresented by this case. The D.C. Circuit has resolved\nthat question in our favor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but we have been\ntalking about it --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a couple of minutes,\nso we --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. I'm here to talk\nabout what you want to talk about, and all I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't start this.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I did, and you can --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: All right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You can go back to your\njurisdiction argument.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Maybe I can finish\nit. The -- the -- I had said that I also wanted to\ncontinue with the text, on the question of what it is to\n\"make inapplicable.\" I pointed out how it is that all\nof these statutes are applied and made inapplicable. I\nalso want to draw the contrast between the two operative\npowers that are given to the President. At the\nbeginning, the statute says the President may suspend\nthe application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions\nAct, which is the kind of power that they are talking\nabout, essentially to lift the statute; whereas, the\nterm of art, we think, \"make inapplicable\" in the\ncontext of these statutes is the narrow power to\nde-designate the state as a state sponsor of terror.\nBut let me just return, if I can --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just\npause --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for a moment.\nThe -- the President in exercising this\nwaiver purported to act not only under the statute but\nunder the Constitution as well. So if we were to accept\nyour argument, we would have to decide whether or not he\nhad the power under the Constitution.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think the question\nis presented here. It could have been an argument that\nwas made, but I don't believe it's presented by this\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not\npresented because your friends on the other side think\nthe -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies.\nBut if we agree with you and disagree with that, it\nseems to me that he has an argument -- the President has\nthe argument that he has this authority under the\nConstitution.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I agree he has that\nargument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case --\nin his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the\ncert petition, I should say, in the question on this\nCourt -- on which this Court granted certiorari.\nI think to decide the debate, Justice\nSouter, of whether we're in equipoise here and the\ndebate about whether or not the power was grand or\ninstead more modest, we have to resolve the -- the\nquestion of what it is that Congress intended to do in\nthis proviso to this emergency appropriations measure.\nWas it confronting a very specific moment in time at\nwhich Baghdad had just fallen and we needed to get\nemergency -- emergency aid to Iraq? Or was it, instead,\nfundamentally changing our policy, making Iraq an ally\ndespite the fact that there wasn't even an Iraqi\ngovernment there? Was he given -- was Congress giving\nthe power to the President to immunize Iraq permanently\nfrom liability under the FSIA, which doesn't even exist\nwith respect to our closest allies, Britain and France?\nThat is a significant over-reading of what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why do you say\n\"permanently\"?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Just under -- just under\nthis statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind\nthe action that made it inapplicable.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't understand how,\nJustice Souter. The -- the powers of the President\nexpired. This statute sunset. Their whole point is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- no, but during the\nperiod in which the statute is applicable, I don't know\nof any reason why he cannot change his designation of\ninapplicability. So that the argument of a permanent\nchange in the foreign policy of the United States or the\n-- or the powers relating to the foreign policy of the\nUnited States doesn't seem to me a legitimate argument.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's fine while it was in\neffect, but it's not anymore. Their point is that they\npermanently made the FSIA -- the -- section 620A of the\nForeign Assistance Act in 2008 and 2009 inapplicable,\nand that would be incredibly unusual. Why would we give\nthat power with respect to Iraq when we don't to our\nvery closest allies? Remember the statute expired, and\nthey say it's still in effect. That's their answer to\nthe sunset. It makes no sense at all.\nThe only thing that makes sense is to read\nit in its context of being a modest attempt to deal with\nan immediate problem. And section 1605(a)(7) says what\nhappens when you deal with that immediate problem. If\nyou change the designation of a state -- if they become\nan ally, if they change their ways -- they are still\nliable for the acts of torture they committed while they\nwere designated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think what\nthey say is that the designation remains in effect. I\ndon't think they say that the power to undesignate\ndisappears.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't understand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd be -- well, I'll ask\nthem, but I'd be surprised if it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me ask the\nsame question with respect to the new statute, the\n\"capital A\" statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would there be -- and I\njust -- I don't know the answer to this. Would there be\nauthority under the \"capital A\" statute to undo the\ndesignation?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. That -- that entire\nprovision was waived with respect to Iraq. And we're --\ntake section 620A --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. He waived it, but\nthe question is whether he would have had the authority\nto undesignate or -- or to rescind the designation of\ninapplicability if he had wished to exercise the\nauthority under the \"capital A\" statute.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I have no -- I'm not aware\nof any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given\nthe President any such power. They say that on the day\nthe President exercised his -- his powers that the\nForeign Assistance Act, section 620A, became\ninapplicable to Iraq, that sanction, and that that\ninapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in\n2005. How it would come back -- how it would come back\nand continue to apply in Iraq in the case of a regime\nchange in Iraq, I have no idea at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Congress could pass a\nlaw.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Franklin, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRANKLIN: Thank you, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to clarify this\nlast part --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we have just been\ndiscussing?\nMR. FRANKLIN: It is not the position of the\nGovernment of Iraq that in the very hypothetical\ninstance in which something would change that they could\nnot be redesignated. We believe they could be\nredesignated. We believe that is also the position of\nthe United States. When we say \"permanent,\" we mean as\nopposed to just temporary. And I might add it is our\nposition that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you'd say that.\nMR. FRANKLIN: It is our position that it\nwill be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now\na very strong ally of the United States in the fight\nagainst terrorism, not a sponsor of it.\nJust a few other points based on the\nargument that just occurred. They are interpreting the\nstatute apparently now to say that the President only\nhad the power to rescind the -- the previous\ndesignations, but that's not what the statute says. If\nthat's what Congress had meant, they would have done\nthat. They said \"make inapplicable.\" And their entire\ncase depends on that statute being applicable today\nbecause it serves as the abrogation of Iraq's sovereign\nimmunity, and it serves as the predicate for subject\nmatter jurisdiction.\nIt cannot be both applicable and having been\nmade inapplicable.\nThe other point that was mentioned -- and\nalso I would also say in this regard that our foreign\npolicy towards Iraq is different than our foreign policy\ntowards other former state-sponsored terrorism. Libya,\nfor example, was taken off the list, but there was an\nexpress requirement that Libya answer to the claims that\nwere before it. And, of course, that was because the --\nthe government that sponsored that terrorism, the -- the\nKhadafi Government, was still in power.\nHere we had gone into the country with U.S.\nmilitary force aided by our allies, and we have ousted\nthe regime, and we were seeking to support Iraq in its\nefforts to rebuild.\nThere was a point about the de-designation\nthat was done in 2004. The Secretary of State -- and it\nis cited on page 25 in the blue brief. The Secretary of\nState said in the de-designation that it was largely\nsymbolic or perhaps a belt and suspenders, but he said\nit was largely symbolic in light of the prior EWSAA\ndetermination. However -- and this is relevant to\nsomething else that occurred. The de-designation was\nalso necessary to allow military exports to Iraq because\nunder the proviso 3 of the EWSAA, military exports were\nspecifically exempted from the President's authority.\nThat also shows that Congress knew how to\nmake exceptions to the President's power when it wanted\nto.\nAnd, finally, I would say that we do agree\nwith the analysis that Justice Souter has -- has\nposited, and that is that this involves a lesser power\nthan the President could have exercised on his own\nauthority to -- to completely espouse the claims. It,\ntherefore, fits entirely within what is normally done in\nthese kinds of cases.\nAnd, Justice Ginsburg, it is also the\nposition of the Government of Iraq that Iraqi victims\nought to be included in any state-to-state diplomatic\nnegotiations. But that is a matter for the two\ngovernments to resolve between themselves, and that is\none of the reasons why these kinds of claims have always\nbeen resolved in that manner in the past. They are\nreciprocal, bilateral concerns that affect two very\nclose allies. Those governments ought to be negotiating\nand resolving those claims, whatever claims there are on\nboth sides, between the two of them.\nIf there are no further questions, thank\nyou, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
