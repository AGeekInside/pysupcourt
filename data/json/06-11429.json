        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 06-11429, Burgess versus\nUnited States.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe rule of lenity requires that any penal\nstatute the government seeks to enforce against an\nindividual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him\nand, as the government acknowledges its brief in this\ncase, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in\nnumerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing\nprovisions. A reaffirmation of that time-honored\nprinciple is all that is necessary to decide this case.\nThe 20-year mandatory --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it time-honored since\nGranderson? Is that the first time we did it?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the rule of lenity has\nbeen --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As to sentences? As to\nsentences?\nMR. FISHER: As to sentencing? No, in the\nmid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision\nwritten by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both\ninvolved the degree of punishment which the defendant\nwould receive. There are other cases: In 1980 the\nSimpson case, and Bifulco around the same time. So this\nCourt has a history of applying the rule of lenity with\nequal force to sentencing provisions as it does to\nstatutes demarcating criminal conduct or not. And of\ncourse, as the green brief specially highlights, the\nvery essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives\nfrom the English common law, which is -- which was\ndesigned to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory\npunishment, not -- not so much whether conduct was\ncriminal or not.\nSo we think that applying that rule in a\nstraightforward manner to this case requires a reversal.\nThe 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A)\napplies only to defendants who have a prior conviction\nfor a, quote, \"felony drug offense.\" Now, a sensible\nreading of that provision is that a State law\nmisdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug\noffense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if the\nrule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in\nthe term, the definition says \"'felony drug offense'\nmeans an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for\nmore than 1 year.\" It doesn't say anything about State\nclassification.\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and if that's all you had on the statute books\nthis might be an easier case. But as you know, I think,\nabove section 44 and section 13 the term \"felony\" is\ndescribed and defined as \"a crime that is classified as\na felony under Federal or State law.\" And so when you\nstart with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term\n\"felony drug offense,\" and you go to the definitional\nsection, the first thing you come to is the definition\nof felony, which says a crime classified as such. And\nthen, as you say, in section 44 you reach another\ndefinition. So we think that at the very least you have\nan ambiguity here in which Congress has given two\nfacially applicable definitions to the operative\nprovision of the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, obviously one\nis a definition of \"felony\" and the other is the\ndefinition of \"felony drug offense\" and the term that's\nat issue here is \"felony drug offense.\"\nMR. FISHER: Well, in a sense it's our\nposition that both are at issue here. The term\n\"felony,\" which is within the term \"felony drug\noffense,\" is also at issue here. And as we've pointed\nout in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief,\nit's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate\ndefinitions one of which is a single term within a\nbroader term in a statute. And so the mere fact, as the\ngovernment would argue, that the word \"felony\" is not\nrepeated in the definition of subsection 44 does not\nmean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition.\nWe've given three examples on pages 11 and\n12 where the sensible reading of the statute is that\nCongress attempted to nest the definition of a single\nterm within the definition of a broader term.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I -- could I ask you\nwhat you think Congress might have been trying to do\nwith the 1994 amendment under -- under your reading?\nBefore 1994 the offense had to be classified as a\nfelony. Then they added this definition of \"felony drug\noffense,\" and as I understand it your reading is that\nnow the offense must be classified as a felony and it\nmust be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more\nthan a year. What would be the reason for adding this\nnew requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by\nmore than a year, if there were not offenses that were\nclassified by States as felonies but were punishable by\nless than a year? I can't see the point unless the\npoint was to rule those out.\nAnd you haven't cited any State statute in\nyour brief that involved an offense that was classified\nas a felony and is punishable by less than a year. You\ncited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year,\nnot more than a year but exactly a year. So is it your,\nyour theory that the reason for adding this new language\nwas to make it clear that those offenses where the\nmaximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a\nday, would not be counted?\nMR. FISHER: I think there is an agreement\nbetween us and the government on this point. We cite in\nour blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple\nof other States where there are crimes that are\nclassified as felonies but punishable in less than a\nyear. And in those cases we agree with the government\nthat that is the effect of the 1994 conforming\namendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take\nlow-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as\nfelonies. What this case is about --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if I could just come\nback to that. I looked at those. You cite Ohio, North\nCarolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by --\nthey all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less\nthan. So the difference is between 12 months and 12\nmonths and a day?\nMR. FISHER: Well, that works on the\nlanguage of the statute, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But is it plausible that's\nthe reason why Congress added this language? They\ndidn't want -- they wanted to make sure that these\nfelonies that were punishable by just 12 months would\nnot be counted?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it is quite\nplausible that the language that Congress added has very\nlittle practical effect. And that flows from the fact\nthat Congress called these nothing more than conforming\namendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to\naccomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might\nhelp to understand by looking at the other outlier\nstates that the government claims got swept in with the\n1994 amendments. We cite statutes from States like\nColorado. Perhaps if I used a concrete example. Take\npossession of a single ounce of marijuana. That is one\nof the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking\nabout, that is a felony punishable by no more than a\nyear. There are a few other States who are outliers in\na different sense, in which they call these crimes\nmisdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make\nthem punishable by 18 months or more.\nAnd so what the government's position is is\nthat in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment\nto exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it\nwas trying to sweep in for the first time into section\n841(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat\nlow-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes,\nas misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year.\nSo we think, for the very reasons the\ngovernment explains, that Congress is trying to avoid\ndisuniformity and happenstance according to how a few\nlocal jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes,\nthat it makes sense to read the '94 conforming\namendments as requiring both the one-year punishment\nrule and the felony classification requirement.\nAnd if you have any doubt on that, we submit\nit really makes sense to remember that what we're what\ntalking about here is a mandatory minimum. And so --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would you do with\nsomeone who was convicted -- had a prior conviction of\n-- for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for\nexample, where there are no felonies? What would you do\nwith that, a very serious drug offense in a State that\ndoesn't use the term \"felony\" at all or a foreign\nconviction?\nMR. FISHER: Well, we've cited a case in our\nbrief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact\nproblem, at least with the New Jersey problem. And what\nthe courts did and what they have done in other\ncircumstances where there's a felony classification\nrequirement is they simply take the crime in New Jersey\nand analogize it to a comparable Federal or local State\ncrime, and if it was -- if it would be classified as a\nfelony in that local jurisdiction, then courts -- and\nthis is even before the 1994 amendments -- courts have\ntreated it as a felony.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what they did -- what\nthey did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is\npunishable -- this offense is punishable by more than a\nyear in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.\nMR. FISHER: I believe, Justice Alito, this\nwas a case before 1994, so that's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I know. And that's how they\nanalogized it to a felony.\nMR. FISHER: Right, because that is the\nFederal definition of a felony, and so that was the\nanalogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here\nand reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal\nwith the unusual problem of New Jersey. Another --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say there are other\nexamples where a -- a noun that is nested in another\ndefinition is separately defined and the two are read\ntogether. How are those phrased? I mean, I could\nunderstand what you say if this provision here read \"The\nterm 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is\npunishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\"\nThen I'd go back to the \"felony\" definition for what a\nfelony means, but it doesn't repeat the \"felony.\" \"The\nterm 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is\npunishable by imprisonment for\" -- do any of the\nexamples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward\nread this way?\nMR. FISHER: All three of them do, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which ones are they? Where\nare they --\nMR. FISHER: They're pages 11 and 12 of the\nyellow brief. And so the first place to start is\nlooking at the bottom of page 11, where the term\n\"employee\" is defined in one provision of the Federal --\nof the Federal statutory code. And then the terms\n\"employee of the Capitol Police,\" \"employee of the House\nof Representatives\" are also defined, and they're\ndefined -- and those broader definitions are in the\nfootnote at the bottom of page 12. And so you see that\nthere, after having defined the term \"employee,\" the\nword \"employee\" is not repeated in those definitions.\nThey talk about \"a member\" or \"an officer\" or \"an\nindividual.\" And so it's much like the circumstance\nhere, where a more generic term is used in the broader\ndefinition, but it makes sense to read in the original\ndefinition.\nThe same thing I think you can see in the\nmiddle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code\nthat we've given this Court. The word \"debtor\" is\ndefined in a certain way, and then later on in the\ndefinitional provision, the term \"debtor's principal\nresidence\" is defined as \"a residential structure\" and\nsuch and such. Again the word \"debtor\" is not repeated\nin the broader definition, but we think the only way to\nmake sense of it is to import the definition of the\nsingle term into the broader term. If Congress had\nwanted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just on that -- just\non that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say\n\"debtor's residential structure,\" you'd think it was\nsomebody else's residential structure?\nMR. FISHER: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nthe point.\nMR. FISHER: Well, there might be, you know,\na very rigid plain-text argument that might be made.\nThe point is that Congress used -- defined the term\n\"debtor's principal residence\" without using the term\n\"debtor\" again and defined it somewhere else. My --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in a provision\nof the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't\nthink there's any question about whose residential\nstructure they would be talking about, even though they\ndon't repeat \"debtor.\" It strikes me as quite different\nthan the provision we have before us today.\nMR. FISHER: Well, then I think I'd refer\nyou back to the employee example. I mean, no example is\ngoing to be exactly on all fours. I'm happy to\nacknowledge that. The idea that I'm trying to get\nacross is it's not unusual for Congress to define single\nterms that are nested within larger terms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- better example. It\ndoesn't quite work because it does not supersede the\nterm \"debtor\" that was used earlier. In the\ngovernment's submission at least in this case, \"felony\ndrug offense\" supersedes the earlier provision in\nsection 13.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right. And I\nthink one way to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me they're\nnot comparable in that sense.\nMR. FISHER: Okay. I think one way to\nunderstand how this statute -- if Congress had wanted to\ndo what the government says it wanted to do, how\nCongress could have made it absolutely clear -- while we\nhave the yellow brief open, we can look at page 13.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question\nbefore going on with this line? You say that both the\n802(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44\ndefinition, right? But was 802(13) ever applicable to\nthis situation? What was the law prior to the 1994\namendment? There was a section, wasn't there, that\ndefined \"felony drug offense\"?\nMR. FISHER: For a time, yes, Justice\nGinsburg, but -- so when the statute was originally\npassed, 802(13) was the sole definition of \"felony,\" and\nthen somewhere along the line between the original\nenactment and the '94 amendments, a definition of\n\"felony drug offense\" was put into 841(b)(1)(A) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. FISHER: -- but that itself just used\nthe word \"felony,\" which again referred the reader back\nto 802(13). So, again, I think there is an agreement\nbetween --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you take a look at\nthat provision that was in 841(b)(1)? Because it seems\nthat it would be duplicative of 802(13).\nMR. FISHER: Are you looking, Justice\nGinsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FISHER: No, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where would we find this?\nMR. FISHER: Oh, this is at 13a of the blue\nbrief, Justice Scalia.\nSo, at page 13a it says, \"For purposes of\nthis subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense' means\nan offense that is a felony under any provision of this\nsubchapter, under any Federal law.\" Now, the word\n\"felony\" again would have referred the reader back to\n802(13). If I understand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But read -- read the end\nof it. Read on where it says, \"or a felony under any\nlaw of a State or foreign country,\" et cetera.\nMR. FISHER: Right. But I think, again, the\nword \"felony\" as it appears in -- in that provision --\nand I think that the government agrees with us on this\n-- would have referred the reader back to 802(13) as of\n1988 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --\nMR. FISHER: -- because there isn't the\nexplicit classification requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it defines what the\nfelony is: \"A felony under any law of a State or\nforeign country that prohibits or restricts conduct\nrelating to narcotic drugs, marijuana,\" et cetera.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the latter\nlanguage, Justice Ginsburg, is defining --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you need to\nlook --\nMR. FISHER: -- \"drug offense,\" whereas the\nword \"felony\" I think is not a self-defining term in\nthat statute as it's written. And to understand whether\nwe're talking about something like a one-year rule or a\nclassification requirement, the reader needs to go back\nto the definitional section.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- the definitional\nsection contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FISHER: As of 1988?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It contradicts it\nbecause the \"felony\" definition is classified as felony\nby Federal or State law.\nMR. FISHER: Well, it says \"a felony under\nthe law of a State.\" So I think the classification\nrequirement -- I don't think it's inconsistent with it.\nIt might clarify it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is \"under any\nprovision of this subchapter or any other Federal law\nthat prohibits or restricts.\" And then in the last\npart, \"under any law of a\" -- of \"State\" -- it picks up\n\"State\" -- \"or a foreign country.\" \"Foreign country\" is\nnot included in 802(13).\nMR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to say that\nthere \"felony\" stands on its own, right?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I guess you could, but\nthen you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to\nfigure out how to define \"felony,\" whether it was a\nclassification or a one-year rule or something else. I\nthink the natural reading, again, would be a\nclassification requirement to the extent to which you\ncouldn't look further than that provision of the\nstatute, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the following true, that\nif you are right the reason Congress passed this new\ndefinition was it wanted to take those handful of States\nwhich have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is\ntalking about, and make clear that they are not covered?\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But if the\ngovernment's right, then the reason Congress did this is\nthat it recognized what I think is the truth, that\nfelonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in\nmany different ways under the laws of many different\nStates and, in a matter where so much prison time turns\non it, wished to create a single, uniform definition.\nNow, if that's right, I'm asking myself\nwhich is a more plausible purpose.\nMR. FISHER: Well, we don't disagree with\nthe government that the one-year rule does serve the\npurpose of helping iron out --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't, because if\nyou're right, then you first have to look to the\npatchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to\nsee whether those different States define the conduct as\nmisdemeanors or felonies. And then, having solved the\npatchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one\nyear. And so the bite of the new definition would be\nwhat Justice Alito said and nothing else.\nNow, that's -- and, yet, on the government's\ninterpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily\napplied, uniform rule.\nNow, if I ask myself which of those is most\nplausible, I hate to tell you which answer I get.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think, Justice Breyer,\nwith due respect, if you look at the way different\nStates treat drug crimes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right? Am I right? I\nmean, I put that out to give you a chance to say. I'm\nnot sure I am right.\nMR. FISHER: That's what I'm trying to\nrespond -- different States treat drug crimes\ndramatically different, and this is so -- I think it's\ncommon sense that States treat different crimes -- treat\n-- different States punish the same crime differently.\nAnd that's nowhere more true than in drug crime, because\nthere's a great amount of experimentation that goes on\nin the States. And one of the things that certain\nStates do, like Colorado, is take very low-level drug\ncrimes and punish them by more than a year, in part so\nthey can give treatment and keep people in, prison, long\nenough to have treatment take hold, whereas some other\nStates treat drug crimes very differently. So you have\na patchwork whether you look to the classification or\nwhether you look to the one-year rule. That's why we\nthink it makes sense to use both.\nNow, if Congress had wanted to do what the\ngovernment is suggesting, which is have the one-year\nrule be the sole and exclusive way of determining\nwhether you have a felony before you, it could have very\neasily said so. And there's an example -- and this is\nat page 13 of the yellow brief -- of what -- of what the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines do.\nThey define -- in a \"career-offender\nprovision\" there is a definition of \"felony\" there that\nis quite explicit. They say a \"felony\" is \"an offense\npunishable by more than a year, regardless of whether\nsuch an offense is specifically designated as a\n'felony.'\"\nSo there are other provisions where Congress\ncould have looked and it would have been well aware of\nhow to make absolutely plain what it was trying to\naccomplish in the statute.\nNow, we don't think that the government's\nreading is implausible, Justice Breyer, for the reason\n--.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, could I just\ngo back to what you quoted. Are you quoting -- you're\nquoting a Sentencing Guideline, right?\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not a statute.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, I'm quoting the Sentencing\nGuideline, although in the Armed Career Criminal Act you\ncan find another place where Congress dealt with this\nproblem explicitly.\nIt said that felonies are crimes punishable\nmore than a year; however, if the State classifies the\ncrime as a misdemeanor, it has to be punishable by more\nthan two years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think it\nwould mean something different if you just left out the\n\"regardless of\" clause?\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, with the\nproblem --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The \"prior adult Federal or\nState conviction for an offense punishable by death or\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\" you think\nit means something different without the \"regardless\".\nMR. FISHER: Not necessarily, but leaving\nthat clause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not at all? Not possibly.\nMR. FISHER: Well, our position is, Justice\nScalia, that, standing alone, I will grant you; but the\nproblem as we see it in this case is that that is left\nout. In a very common problem, how to define a felony,\nthey leave out that explicit statement of whether\nclassification is important. And what is more, in the\nsame definitional provision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would say that\n\"regardless\" clause is extraordinary and I would not\nwant to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a\nregular basis.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think there's a good\nreason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is\na continually vexing problem, how to define what is a\nfelony. That's why Congress did it explicitly in the\nArmed Career Criminal Act. That's why the Sentencing\nGuidelines are explicit here. And leaving that out, and\nagainst the backdrop of a statute where the\nclassification rule was the controlling rule for over a\ndecade, and where they leave that classification rule in\nthe very same definitional provision of the statute, we\nthink, gives rise to an ambiguity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's such a\nvexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the\nproblem into the definition of \"felony drug offense\"?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure I follow the\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you seem to\nsuggest that it's a vexing problem that \"felony\" is\ndefined differently in different States. And, yet, you\nsay that the term \"felony,\" which relies on how it's\ndefined by different States, was incorporated in the\nfelony drug offense, which seems to have a quite clear\ndefinition of punishable by more than one year.\nIf they don't want to repeat the problem\nthat \"felony\" is defined differently in different\nStates, they would not do what you're suggesting, which\nis incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.\nMR. FISHER: Well, with all due respect,\nwhat Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books,\nwhich does turn on classifications. And it's not --\neven though it is a -- it is something of a patchwork,\nit is not unusual at all to have very serious\nconsequences turn on whether something is classified as\na \"felony\" or not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, of course, they had\nto leave it on the books because they need a definition\nof \"felony.\" \"Felony\" has to be defined in many places,\nbut this is a definition of \"felony drug offense.\" So\n--\nMR. FISHER: Well, again, Justice Ginsburg,\nI think that is right. But then what Congress could\nhave done is use the language that the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines use, or something comparable to\nmake clear its intent.\nAnd the classification of a felony or not a\nfelony, as this Court knows, has a time-honored import.\nThings like the right to vote, the right to bear arms,\nthe right to various civil rights turn on whether\nsomebody has been convicted of a felony or a\nmisdemeanor.\nAnd, again, this brings us in a sense back\nto the rule of lenity because one of the principal\nreasons for the rule of lenity is fair notice. Now,\nthis Court, as early as the McBoyle decision recognized\nthat we're dealing with something of a fiction when we\nimagine an offender is looking at the statutory books to\ndecide whether certain conduct is prohibited or not.\nBut in the context of recidivist\nenhancements that lead to mandatory minimums, we're\ntalking about very real and serious notice problems.\nImagine the conscientious public defender advising\nsomeone like Mr. Burgess as to whether he should plead\nguilty to a misdemeanor or a felony. This happens in\nStates across the country that have three-strike\nprovisions, that have very serious immigration\nconsequences turning on \"felony\" or \"misdemeanor.\" That\nlawyer might have concluded, as the District of Columbia\nCircuit did, that pleading to a misdemeanor here would\nnot expose Mr. Burgess in the event he was convicted of\na later crime to such a serious punishment as the\n20-year mandatory minimum in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what\nhappened in South Carolina? Could he on those facts and\nunder the charges have been sentenced to more than a\nyear? It was just that the judge gave him less than a\nyear?\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Burgess's crime, possession\nof cocaine, was punishable by up to two years. So, yes,\nhe received a sentence far less than that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But he, himself, was\neligible for the --\nMR. FISHER: Yes. The crime to which he\npled guilty was punishable by two years. But you should\nunderstand that that kind of hypothetical, punishable-by\nproblem is one I know this Court dealt with a couple of\nmonths ago in the Rodriguez case. And you should\nunderstand that not just what Congress, under the\ngovernment's view, had been looking to sweep in outlier\nStates like Colorado, but if the government prevails in\nthe Rodriguez case where the term \"punishable by\" turns\non recidivist enhancements, then the 1994 amendments,\nwhich were termed \"conforming amendments,\" have an even\nfar more sweeping effect and bring in lots of State-law\nmisdemeanors that were never covered by the prior act.\nIf there are no more questions, I will\nreserve my time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just one. You said that\nin most States what Burgess did, his crime, simple\npossession, would not encounter a sentence of upward of\none year. Did you do a survey? Did you document that\nin your brief?\nMR. FISHER: No. But I said earlier,\nJustice Ginsburg, giving the example of possession of\none ounce of marijuana, that the vast majority of States\npunished that as a misdemeanor by less than a year.\nMr. Burgess's crime, at best, was a\nmisdemeanor punishable by less than a year under Federal\nlaw, but different States treat that crime differently.\nAnd I think a majority of those, a majority of States,\nwould treat that as a crime punishable by more than a\nyear and classified as a \"felony.\nIf there are no more questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress answered the question presented in\nthis case when it adopted an express definition for\n\"felony drug offense.\" Under that definition, \"felony\ndrug offense\" means an offense punishable by more than\none year of imprisonment under certain State, Federal,\nor foreign drug laws.\nThere is no textual basis for going beyond\nthat definition to also require that an offense be\nclassified as a \"felony.\" The enhancement trigger in\nthe sentencing-enhancement provision is a felony drug\noffense, and the way that the definition works is that\nyou take the definition Congress provided for \"felony\ndrug offense.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is \"drug\" a nested\nterm in that? It doesn't really define \"drug.\" Do they\nlook somewhere else for that definition?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the term \"felony drug\noffense,\" the \"drug\" component we understand to be the\ncomponent that says \"an offense\" that prohibits --\n\"under law that prohibits or restricts conduct related\nto narcotic drugs, marijuana, anabolic steroids\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a place you\nwould -- is that a place you would look if you didn't\nknow what they meant by \"drug\"? If an issue arose\nwhether, you know, a natural narcotic, I mean is that a\ndrug or not?\nMS. SAHARSKY: There is a definition of\n\"drug\" at the beginning of the Controlled Substances Act\nin section 802. It refers back to the general\ndefinition of \"drug,\" I believe in section 321 of the\nControlled --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that is nested in\nthis definition, \"felony drug offense\"?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The term \"felony drug\noffense\" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it.\nIn the words it shows that it be punishable by more than\none year under State, Federal or foreign law relating to\nthose particular drugs.\nIn fact, the question that you asked shows\nwhy Petitioner's reading of the statute cannot be\ncorrect, that you can't use both the definition of\n\"felony drug offense\" that Congress provided and try to\nimport in separate definitions for \"felony\" and separate\ndefinitions for \"drug,\" because the definition of \"drug\"\nin the Controlled Substances Act is very broad and\napplies to many different kinds of drugs, whereas the\ndefinition of \"felony drug offense\" only refers to\noffenses that involve narcotic drugs, anabolic steroids,\nmarijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.\nIn the same way, this shows why Petitioner\ncannot be correct that the definition of \"felony\" also\nmust be brought into \"felony drug offense,\" because\nCongress chose that the measure of seriousness in\n\"felony drug offense\" is an offense punishable by more\nthan one year. And it actually took out of the statute\nthe measure of seriousness which is classification as a\nfelony. So to bring that requirement back in would undo\nthe change that Congress made in 1994.\nThat's the language, Justice Ginsburg, that\nwe were looking at at the bottom of the -- at the back\nof the blue book. In 1988 it said \"'Felony drug\noffense' means an offense which is a felony.\" And that\nlanguage was taken out and Congress replaced it with\nthis new language, which says \"punishable by more than\none year of imprisonment.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with\nyour friend's argument that the classification -- or the\nterm, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't\nalways have to do with how serious they view the\noffense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one\nyear to allow time for rehabilitation?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Congress chose the words that\nit did, \"punishable by more than one year,\" because it\nbelieved it to be a good measure of seriousness. This\nCourt has recognized in cases like Blanton versus City\nof North Las Vegas that the term of imprisonment that a\nlegislature chooses is a good measure of the seriousness\nof the offense. There may be offenses that a State\nclassifies as more or less serious based on punishment,\nbut Congress wanted to do its best to get uniformity in\nprovision -- in this provision. So what it did here was\nto take out this requirement that would look to varying\nState and foreign laws and instead have one that was\njust based on term of imprisonment.\nAnd actually this -- this raises a very\nserious problem with Petitioner's reading of the\nstatute, which is with respect to foreign offenses. The\n\"felony drug offense\" definition allows an enhancement\nbased on State, Federal or foreign offenses, and the\ndefinition of \"felony\" unadorned and standing by itself\ndoesn't refer to foreign offenses at all, which means\nthat there is a serious ambiguity if both apply as to\nwhat would be done in the case of trying to enhance\nbased on a foreign offense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I suppose it might\nfor countries that use that classification, for common\nlaw countries.\nMS. SAHARSKY: There are countries that do\nuse the felony- misdemeanor distinction. There are some\nthat do not. But we understand in 1994 that Congress --\nthe change Congress made to be one that eliminates those\nkinds of ambiguities.\nAnd certainly, if Congress had thought in\n1994 that both the separate definition of felony and the\ndefinition of felony drug offense mattered, that it\nwould have placed foreign offenses in the definition of\nfelony, and it didn't do that here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the information we\nhave in the brief says that there are two States that\nhave dropped those labels. Are there more than New\nJersey and Maine?\nMS. SAHARSKY: New Jersey and Maine are the\nonly ones that I'm aware of.\nCertainly, as this Court discussed in some\nprevious questions, there may be ways in which courts\ncould try to work around ambiguities that, for example,\nexisted in the statute 1990 -- prior to 1994, to figure\nout how offenses in New Jersey should be treated. But\nthe fact that Congress made the change in 1994 to pick\nclear language that would just turn on the authorized\nterm of imprisonment shows that that's what should be\nused, that choice should be given effect.\nThe fact that courts might be able to deal\nwith an ambiguous statute certainly does not give\nlicense to create one where it doesn't otherwise exist.\nThere's an example the Petitioner raised,\nwhich is how violent felonies are treated in the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, and I think that that -- that\nillustrates how Congress could have done what Petitioner\nwanted if that was, in fact, its intent. In the ACCA, a\nviolent felony, which could be the basis for a sentence\nenhancement, is defined as various violent offenses that\nare punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. But\nthen Congress specifically decided that it wanted to\nexempt state misdemeanor offenses that it didn't\nconsider serious enough to qualify as violent felonies.\nSo it exempted State offenses that are classified as\nmisdemeanors and punishable by less than two years. And\nwe think that the Congress' treatment in the ACCA\nexempting specific State offenses shows that if Congress\nhad wanted to exempt offenses classified as misdemeanors\nin the way that Petitioner suggests, then it would have\ndone so in that way.\nCongress chose a meaning here for \"felony\ndrug offense\" and we think that it needs to be given\neffect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us just a\nlittle bit about the rule of lenity? You want us to\napply sort of a watered down discount rule of lenity in\nsentencing cases? And do you have authority for that?\nMS. SAHARSKY: The government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: After we said in\nGranderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying\nor modifying it at all.\nMS. SAHARSKY: The government's position is\nthat the rule of lenity operates in the same manner in\nboth the defining the offense context and in the\nsentencing context. The point that we were making in\nour brief is that the purposes behind the rule of lenity\nare really implicated to a lesser extent when we're\ntalking about sentencing, and particularly with respect\nto mandatory minimums, because there's not a question of\nwhether the offense conduct at issue is illegal, and\nthere's not a question about the maximum offense, the\nmaximum term of imprisonment that the person could be\nsubject to.\nSo, our brief should be best understood as a\nresponse to Petitioner's extensive historical discussion\nof the rule of lenity and a suggestion that it applies\nwith even more vigor in the context of mandatory\nminimums. We don't think that that's the case, but at\nthe same time we are not suggesting there is a new\ndifferent rule of lenity in this context.\nAnd again, we don't see this as a rule of\nlenity case. Congress picked a particular definition\nand it used those terms -- that term \"felony drug\noffense\" to trigger each of the sentencing enhancement\nprovisions here. We don't think there is any reason to\nlook beyond it.\nIf the Court has no further questions,\nGovernment submits the judgment below should be\naffirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nSaharsky.\nMr. Fisher, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I might pick up where Justice Kennedy\nleft off with the rule of lenity, because we don't want\nthis Court to lose sight of the importance of the rule\nof lenity in this case. It's not our position that the\ngovernment's reading is unreasonable. It is simply our\nposition that our reading of the statute is a possible\none and that Congress may have been --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there has to be\na real ambiguity. I mean, if there is a plausible\ndefendant-friendly interpretation, that doesn't trigger\nthe rule of lenity, does it or doesn't it?\nMR. FISHER: I think, Justice Kennedy, a\nfair way to ask yourself the question is, would the\nstatute here rise to the level of a plain statement of a\nkind that is required to, for example, abrogate\nsovereign immunity or to realign the Federal State\nbalance. The term \"clear statement\" and \"clear and\ndefinition statement\" that is used in the historical\ncontext --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many statutes exist\nlike that, my goodness? You want the government to be\nheld in all statutes to a level that is clear enough to\nsatisfy the clear statement --\nMR. FISHER: With all due respect, Justice\nScalia, that's what the historical cases say.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the rule of\nlenity means.\nMR. FISHER: Yes. With all due respect. If\nyou look at the examples in Blackstone, that's the\nGreenbury cite, if you look at this Court's earliest\ncases, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the court in\nWiltberger that even though it's extremely improbable\nthat Congress wanted the result that the defendant\npresses, the Court is nevertheless going to insist on\nit, because it is not unambiguously clear this was\nCongress' intent.\nAnd so, it's easy to forget given the modern\nproliferation of Federal criminal statutes how rare\ncriminal cases used to be in this court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do our cases reflect what\nyou're saying? I thought our cases on the rule of\nlenity say that where there is an ambiguity you give the\ntie to the defendant.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think this is very\nimportant, Justice Scalia, your cases, especially the\nhistorical cases and the modern ones, I think, waffle in\ndifferent directions, but there are plenty of cases from\nthis Court that are much more than a tie-breaker in the\nsense of the rule of lenity and say, we require clear\nand definite terms, that's the phrase Justice\nFrankfurter used to repeat. Justice Holmes said the\nstatute must be clear. Even up to Granderson it says --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was in a context\nwhere the question was whether or not the conduct was\ncriminal at all not since.\nMR. FISHER: That's right. But for the\nreason --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you apply clear\nstatement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we\nare going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think with due respect\nwhat you're going to do is actually reduce the number of\ncases this court hears, because once you have a clear\nstatement rule, two things are going to happen. The\nlower courts are going to find it more -- easier to\nresolve these kinds of cases because just like in the\nsovereign immunity and Federalism context, it's much\neasier to look for a clear statement. And even more\nimportantly, Congress will know that when it legislates\nin the realm of criminal sentencing, that it needs to be\nclear, and it will solve this case -- this Court the\nproblem, perhaps, of having four or five cases on its\ndocket every term involving circuit splits and how to\napply mandatory minimums in the vast labyrinth of\nFederal criminal sentencing provisions.\nSo we think this Court can rest assured, of\ncourse, that if it rules for the Petitioner in this case\nand Congress doesn't like the result, that it is well\nand able and ready to step in to solve that problem.\nThe problem is, is that if this Court accepts broad\nreadings of the government, from the government of\ncriminal statutes, that the institutional forces that\ndrive legislation are -- make it much less likely that\nCongress can step in to solve that problem in favor of\ncriminal defendants.\nSo for the reasons we've explained, we think\nthis Court should go back to the historical\nunderstanding brought forward to the present of the\nimportance of the rule of lenity, and in this case find\nthat the statute does not clearly and unambiguously\napply to Petitioner.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nsubmit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
