        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll now hear\nargument in Case 10-179, Stern v. Marshall.\nMr. Richland.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICHLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPierce Marshall filed a claim in Vickie\nMarshall's bankruptcy case. He alleged he was damaged\nbecause she falsely accused him of cheating her out of\nmoney that her late husband intended to give her. In\norder to preserve its claim against him, the bankruptcy\nestate had no choice but then to file its counterclaim\nin the bankruptcy court, alleging that those statements\nwere in fact true and that far from Pierce being\nentitled to money from the estate, he owed money to the\nbankruptcy estate. This Court's cases established that\nthe bankruptcy court was constitutionally authorized to\ndecide that entire dispute.\nCongress drafted the bankruptcy statutes -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me why?\nMR. RICHLAND: Excuse me, Your Honor? I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the authority at\nall for a bankruptcy court to adjudicate proof of\nclaims, without violating Article III? I don't think\nwe've ever had a case that's actually said that.\nMR. RICHLAND: This Court has never\napproached that issue directly. Of course -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's -\nMR. RICHLAND: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's the\nconstitutional basis?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, it need not\nreach that issue in this case, because the court below\nand the Respondents assume for the purposes of this case\nthat, in fact, there was authority for the bankruptcy\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how that\nhelps. If there's no jurisdiction for the bankruptcy\ncourt to adjudicate proof of claims, then how can it\nadjudicate counterclaims? Don't both fall if there's an\nArticle III violation?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, I don't think so, Your\nHonor, because Article III, of course, is not\njurisdictional in the sense that we think of basic\nfundamental jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.\nIt can be waived, of course. But beyond that, I think\nthat Marathon, as I said, assumes that there is Article\nIII authority to adjudicate the proof of claim.\nKatchen -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, answer the -\nMR. RICHLAND: Katchen -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Answer the question.\nDon't assume.\nMR. RICHLAND: Okay. And -- well, the\nanswer is that, under -- under the various theories that\nthis Court has put forth, there is a basis for the\nbankruptcy court to adjudicate a proof of claim.\nOne theory, of course, is the public rights\ntheory, and in Granfinanciera, this Court established\nthat the -- the public rights theory was broader than\njust the kind of situation where the government was a\nparty, and it said that -- that it -- public rights are\ndefined as whether Congress, acting under Article I, has\ncreated a seemingly private right that is so closely\nintegrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a\nmatter appropriate for agency resolution with limited\ninvolvement by the Article III judiciary.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The claim here was not one\nthat was created by Congress, though, was it?\nMR. RICHLAND: That's -- that's correct, but\nthis Court has never held that in fact the claim had to\nbe created by -- literally created by Congress. What\nthis Court has always talked about is -- is, is the\nclaim one that Congress has established as being\napplicable within the system but that may be based on a\nState law claim?\nFor example, when, you know, this Court\nanalyzed the claims which were at issue in\nGranfinanciera, it looked at the fact that they were\nfundamentally common law claims. It didn't depend on\nthe fact that they were Federal claims.\nThe same thing was -- is true in the way\nthat the -- that this Court analyzed the -- the claim in\n-- in Marathon itself. It made the determination that\nbecause this was -- I think the way Justice Rehnquist\nstated it was: This is the stuff that would have been\nadjudicated at common law in Westminster in 1789. So it\nwas not the Federal or State nature of the claim, it was\nthe fact that these were common law claims that made it\nimportant.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Are there any limits, Mr.\nRichland? Suppose that Congress had authorized\nbankruptcy courts to decide contract disputes between\ntwo creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Would that be\nall right?\nMR. RICHLAND: I think that there are\nlimits, and they must be related to the purpose of\nbankruptcy. I think that a -- that sort of thing would\nbe related to, perhaps, within the \"related to\"\njurisdiction of bankruptcy, and that would fall within\nthe problems identified in Granfinanciera, for example.\nThat would be beyond the scope of what could be\nadjudicated in bankruptcy.\nBut what we are talking about here is claims\nand counterclaims that are at the essence of what\nbankruptcy courts do. The bankruptcy system, of course,\nis set up in order to adjudicate claims to a limited\namount of money, and in order to do that in an efficient\nmanner, in a manner that will not utilize the entire\namount of the -- the estate in the adjudication process,\nit set up the bankruptcy courts. And so they are set up\nin order to be efficient, effective, and as soon as, of\ncourse, as we get an Article III court involved, that\nreally does place some brakes on the efficiency. It\nbecomes much more costly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can the bankruptcy court\nadjudicate permissive counterclaims?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if you posit a no,\nwhat's the limiting principle?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, certainly the\nstatute -- 157(b)(3), (2) -- does not distinguish\nbetween compulsory and permissive counterclaims. And\nit's also true that this Court's authority in\nGranfinanciera, in Langenkamp and in Katchen -- the\nrationale of those cases is broad enough to encompass\npermissive counterclaims, but this Court need not reach\nthat issue in this case, because here we do have what\nboth the court of appeals below and what seems to have\nbeen conceded by Respondents is, indeed, a compulsory\ncounterclaim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richland, isn't there\nthis difference: Just to take ordinary civil procedure,\ncompulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any\njurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under\nthe wing of the main claim, but a permissive\ncounterclaim has to independently satisfy a\njurisdictional requirement.\nSo that could be a reason, even though the\nBankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish\nthe two. If there's an authority to deal with the\nclaim, then there's authority to deal with the\ncounterclaim, but if it's a permissive counterclaim,\nit's not based on the same transaction or premise, then\nit would have to be a self-standing claim. But, as\nyou -- as you have said, this case does present what the\nparties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, I -- I think that -\nthat is an excellent justification for why one might\nwant to make this a very narrow determination in this\ncase. In fact, Justice Rehnquist, in his concurring\nopinion in Marathon, said that this is an area which is\nvery touchy and difficult and complex, and it is one\nwhere we particularly should not, as a court, go beyond\nthe facts of the individual case and what must be\ndecided for this case.\nOf course, the other thing about compulsory\ncounterclaims and what makes it more applicable in this\nkind of situation in an Article III setting is that,\naccording to the Schor analysis, what we are talking\nabout is how much of an intrusion on the Article III\nprocess are we talking about. And if we assume, as\nappears to have been assumed here, that the claim itself\nmay be determined by the bankruptcy court, then the net\nintrusion by determining a counterclaim, a compulsory\ncounterclaim, is much, much smaller, because there\nalmost inevitably will be overlap between what must be\ndecided by the bankruptcy court and what -- on the claim\nand what must be decided on the counterclaim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any authority -\nthis began as a motion for -- for nondischargeability.\nMR. RICHLAND: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there -- is there -\nare there any cases in the -- in the Federal courts\nwhich tell us that a motion for nondischargeability does\nor does not require the pleading of a counterclaim?\nMR. RICHLAND: I don't believe so, Justice\nKennedy. But in fact, what happened here was something\nmuch, much more than just a motion, a request for\ndetermination of nondischargeability, because 1 month\nafter that was filed, the actual proof of claim itself\nwas filed. And all the courts below have uniformly\nconcluded that when that additional step is taken, it\ncould have no purpose other than to present the claim -\nbeyond just the question of dischargeability, present\nthe question of liquidation of the claim to the\nbankruptcy court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the counterclaim came\nat what point? After the proof of claim was filed?\nMR. RICHLAND: That is correct. Some weeks\nafter the proof of claim was filed, the -- the\ncounterclaim was filed. The objections and counterclaim\nwas filed.\nThe -- the statutory structure here is\nsomething that -- it has been suggested that this is a\nquestion of statutory interpretation and that, in fact,\nthe statute does not provide for this kind of treatment,\nthat, in fact, there is a two-step process by which one\ndetermines whether a bankruptcy court can finally decide\na counterclaim. But I think that really is belied by\nthe plain language of the statute as well as the\nstatutory structure.\nOf course, the starting point is\n157(b)(2)(C), which very clearly and straightforwardly\nstates that core claims include counterclaims by the\nestate against persons filing claims against the estate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the fact\nthat -- that (b)(2) says core proceedings include, but\nare not limited to, the matters that are listed after\nthat?\nHow would a court go about deciding whether\nsomething that is not specifically mentioned constitutes\na core proceeding except by looking back to (b)(1),\nwhich is what the court of appeals did?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, I think that when -- a\ncourt would indeed, if one were looking at something\nthat was outside the scope of the explicitly mentioned\ncategories from (B) to (N) in 157(b)(2), one would in\nfact look beyond the words of (A) and (O) -- those are\nthe two catch-all provisions -- and one would look to\nthe usual, normal principles of statutory construction\nto determine what fit within them.\nBut 152 -- 157(b)(2)(C) is very\nstraightforward. It does not require any additional\ninterpretation. There is -- a counterclaim against a\nperson filing a proof of claim is just, on its face,\nsomething that is unambiguous. And the fact that there\nare more ambiguous categories there would probably\nrequire a court to go beyond, you know, the four corners\nof the statute and look to the normal kinds of\nprinciples we use in determining what statutes mean.\nWe'd look at the categories that were\nactually included. We would see, is this something that\nis similar, does it fall within that category, and so\non.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you think is the\nprinciple that defines a core proceeding? Some of these\nspecifically enumerated items are very -- potentially\nvery broad: (A) \"matters concerning the administration\nof the estate.\"\nMR. RICHLAND: That's right. The -- (A) and\n(O) are very broad. And so, what -- that category -\nwhat those two categories would have to be informed by\nand are informed by are the principles of statutory\nconstruction that are normally used. And included among\nthose, we would contend, would be looking at the words\nof the statute that talk about, does this arise under\nthe Bankruptcy Code or arise in a bankruptcy case?\nSo for those particular categories, the\nlower courts have been comfortable with the idea that we\nlook at the language of the statute, apply those words\nand use those as limitations, but with respect to the\nspecific categories from (B) to (N), the courts have\nuniformly indicated that those categories do not require\nfurther interpretation, that they are straightforward,\nand they constitute core proceedings on their face.\nI think the -- with respect to the question\nthat you asked, Justice Sotomayor, and the whole issue\nof whether a matter is under -- may pass muster under\nArticle III is a very easy one in this case. And the\nreason for that is that if we look to Schor and Schor's\nArticle III analysis, we can see that it really divides\ninto two parts.\nPart 1 is: Was there some -- is the Article\nIII -- to the extent the Article III right is a personal\none, that is to the extent that it guarantees someone\na -- a decision maker who is not going to be affected by\nthe political branches of the government or by the winds\nof politics, that's something that's waivable. And, in\nfact -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't say you waive\nit when -- when, in order to protect yourself for a debt\nthat is owed to you, you make a claim in a bankruptcy\nproceeding. We do have a doctrine that you cannot -\nyou cannot condition a Federal right upon the waiver of\nconstitutional protections. And that seems to me what\nyou're saying here. If you want to get paid by the\nbankrupt estate, you have to waive your -- your right to\na -- to a jury trial.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, Justice Scalia, that is\nprecisely what this Court addressed in footnote 14 in\nGranfinanciera. It explained that, yes, waiver under\nmany circumstances and -- under the Schor case, for\nexample, waiver involves a choice between two equal or\noptional options.\nHowever, I should point out that in this\ncase, there was another option. There was a\ndischargeability complaint filed, and, in fact, the\nchoice was made not to pursue that but, instead, to\npursue the proof of claim. There was already a State\ncourt suit on file and, instead of requesting a stay, a\nrelief from the bankruptcy stay, the proof of claim was\nfiled.\nIn general, however, the Alexander v.\nHillman principle, which is also discussed in footnote\n14, is what applies in this -- in this circumstance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it have been normal\nfor the bankruptcy judge to lift the stay with respect\nto a claim that could be presented in the bankruptcy\nproceeding?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, the -- certainly the -\nthe principles of -- of permissive abstention, for\nexample, encourage, if, in fact, comity is to be\nrespected and if there is another suit pending\nelsewhere, that bankruptcy courts will permit the suit\nto proceed in that jurisdiction, so that that does in\nfact occur. But it was never even tried here, and\nthat's -- that's really the point.\nAnd I'd like to reserve the rest of my time,\nbut I would like to make one final point before I sit\ndown initially, and that is, if this Court should decide\nto reverse, that as we requested in our -- in our reply\nbrief and as we requested in our relief on our\ncross-appeal, we would request that -- that this case be\nsent back to the district court, because it was the\ndistrict court that in the first instance applied the\nimproper standard, and we think that would be an\nappropriate way of -- of taking care of this case in\nthis instance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI -- I'd like to begin by addressing Justice\nScalia's question about the -- what's sometimes referred\nto as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, whether\nit's appropriate to place a person in a position where\nhe has to make a choice whether to assert one of two\nconstitutional rights. And although there is in many\ncontexts reluctance to put an individual to that choice,\nthere's not an inflexible rule against it.\nAnd to take one example, a criminal\ndefendant has an absolute constitutional right to\ntestify in his own defense. He also has an absolute\nconstitutional right to resist compelled testimony in\nwhich the prosecution will ask him hostile questions,\nbut he doesn't have a constitutional right to do both.\nIf he chooses -- chooses to take the stand and testify,\nhe may be cross-examined at trial by the prosecution,\nand he has no residual Fifth Amendment right to resist\nthe hostile questioning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a little -\nit's a little different when you're talking about the\nright to have a -- a decision before an Article III\ntribunal. It seems a bit more fundamental than the\nexamples you're giving.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I don't know that it's\nmore fundamental than the right not to be questioned\nagainst one's will in a criminal proceeding in which\nyou're -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not -- not\nfundamental in the sense of is it important or not. I\nguess \"fundamental\" is not the right word. Maybe\n\"structural\" or -- or something like that. It's sort of\nthe whole basis for the decision that's going to be\nmade.\nMR. STEWART: I guess there are two\npotential objections to the use of a non-Article III\njudge, and one of them would be, as you say, structural;\nthat is, one of the objections that is sometimes made to\nthe use of non-Article III adjudicators is that if\nCongress can parcel out part of the work of the\njudiciary to other units, the stature of the judicial\nbranch will be diminished.\nI think this particular statute doesn't\ncreate that risk, because the use of bankruptcy judges\nis entirely under the control of the district judges;\nthat is, the district court decides whether to refer a\nbankruptcy case to the bankruptcy judge; the district\ncourt can withdraw the referral with respect to\nparticular proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just\nmeans that the district court is acting in concert with\nCongress -- take action that undermines the long-term\ninstitutional and constitutional basis of the judiciary.\nAnd the district courts have their different reasons and\nincentives to do that. That doesn't mean that all bets\nare off, and just because they're involved in the\nprocess it's not a concern.\nMR. STEWART: Well, to the extent that the\nconcern is with fairness to individual litigants, that\nis, the idea that the Respondent in this case has a\nright to an Article III tribunal and should not likely\nbe held to have waived it, I think that a person who\nseeks affirmative relief from a court doesn't waive all\nhis constitutional rights, to be sure, but should\nordinarily be taken to accept the consequences that\nordinarily follow from a request for judicial relief.\nAnd as a matter of history and tradition, one of the\nconsequences that follows from the assertion of an\naffirmative claim is subjection to counterclaims, and\nespecially compulsory counterclaims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That can't be right.\nYou -- you can take all sorts of matters that belong in\nArticle III courts, and so long as you place them in\nsome other tribunal where somebody is coerced into\ncoming in, supposedly voluntarily, it's all okay. I\nmean, that's -- that's not an adequate protection.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the Court has applied\nthis basic principle in a number of contexts. That is,\nin McElrath v. United States, which is cited in the\nPetitioner's brief, the plaintiff filed suit against the\nUnited States in the Court of Claims, and the United\nStates then asserted counterclaims against him, and the\noriginal plaintiff said that he had a -- a right to jury\ntrial under the Seventh Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because\nthere's a basic sovereign immunity. The government\ndoesn't have to be sued at all.\nMR. STEWART: The government doesn't have -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so it can -- so it can\nmake conditions, but that's not this case.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the government can make\nconditions, but -- but the point was the plaintiff in\nthat situation had no alternative forum to which he\ncould attempt to obtain a recovery from the government.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's because of the\nlimitation of sovereign immunity, and you don't -- and\nyou don't have that analogue here.\nMR. STEWART: Another example would be Adam\nv. Saenger, which is also cited in the Petitioner's\nbrief, in which I believe it was a Texas plaintiff filed\nsuit in the California State courts, and the California\ndefendant asserted a -- a cross-complaint, basically a\ncounterclaim, against him, and the Texas plaintiff\nobjected to the California court's assertion of personal\njurisdiction.\nAnd this Court said: By seeking affirmative\nrelief from the California court, you have subjected\nyourself to the jurisdiction of that court for all\npurposes for which justice requires. And it said the\nState can make that the price it pays for seeking\naffirmative judicial relief in its courts. Now, it may\nhave -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A State can do that, but\ncan the Federal Government make it the price that you\npay for -- for going into a non-Article III tribunal?\nMR. STEWART: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a different situation,\nit seems.\nMR. STEWART: Well, let me step back a\nsecond and address the questions that were posed by\nJustices Sotomayor and Alito at the -- at the beginning\nabout the initial authority of the bankruptcy judge to\nadjudicate the claim brought against the estate, because\nI agree with my colleague's answer that this is a\nquestion -- and with Justice Sotomayor, that this is a\nquestion that this Court hasn't squarely resolved.\nNow, it's true that the initial -- that the\nState law claim, the defamation claim that was made the\nbasis for the claim against the estate, was a State law\ncause of action. But as this Court said in Katchen v.\nLandy, the effect of the commencement of the bankruptcy\ncase is to convert the claimant's potential legal claim\nagainst the defendant into an equitable claim against\nthe estate.\nAnd Respondent's equitable claim against the\nestate seeking a share of the assets was a claim created\nby Federal law. That is, it's true that in the course\nof deciding whether Respondent was ultimately entitled\nto a share of the estate, the bankruptcy court would\nhave been required to adjudicate State law questions and\nconduct something like the same proceedings that could\nhave arisen in a State case, but actually obtaining a\nshare of the bankruptcy estate requires more than that\nthere be a valid debt.\nThe whole point of bankruptcy is to deal\nwith situations in which the debtor doesn't have enough\nassets to go around, and so the bankruptcy court will\nhave to not only determine whether a valid debt exists,\nbut what are the relative priorities of various\ncreditors, what is the appropriate pro rata share for a\nparticular claimant, and all of that is to be resolved\nunder Federal law.\nSo, when Respondent filed a proof of claim\nin the bankruptcy case, it was asserting a Federal right\ncognizable under the Bankruptcy Code. And, again, none\nof the -- none of the analogues that I've identified are\nprecisely analogous to this one, but I think it's\nnoteworthy that Respondent cites no contrary authority\nfrom this Court. That is, Respondent cites no case in\nwhich a claimant has invoked the authority of a\nparticular court and has asked for affirmative relief,\nand this Court has held that it nevertheless had a\nconstitutional entitlement to be free of counterclaims.\nAnd that seems particularly true of\ncompulsory counterclaims, both because they are\ncounterclaims that our legal system affirmatively\nencourages to be brought within the same proceeding and\nfor the reason that Justice Ginsburg said, that in an\nanalogous area of the law, when we ask whether there is\nFederal court jurisdiction over a counterclaim to begin\nwith, if the counterclaim is compulsory, there need be\nno independent basis for jurisdiction.\nI'd like to address quickly the statutory\nquestion, and the relevant provisions begin at page 1a\nof the Government's brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Will you include in that\nthis 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a\nfutile exercise if that tort claim comes -- comes out of\nthe bankruptcy judge's -\nMR. STEWART: I think the 157(b)(5) is, in\nour view, not jurisdictional. It deals with the -- the\nrespective authorities of the bankruptcy judge and the\ndistrict court within the bankruptcy case, but it\ndoesn't go to the question of what the -- the Federal\ncourts can adjudicate and the limitations on bankruptcy\ncourt authority are waivable and subject to consent.\nThe court of appeals did not address the\npersonal injury aspect of the case. There is a -- a\nlively dispute between the parties as to whether that\nobjection to bankruptcy court adjudication was properly\npreserved, and that would be open to the court of\nappeals on remand if this Court were to reverse.\nOn page 1a -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Stewart, do -- do\nyou think that we should resolve the constitutional\nquestion if there's some significant possibility that it\nwouldn't be necessary because the claims would be found\nto fit into (b)(5)?\nMR. STEWART: I think -- yes, I mean, this\ncould have been a prudential factor that might have\npersuaded the Court not to grant certiorari in the first\ninstance, but the Court has obviously identified this as\nan issue that warrants the expenditure of its resources.\nAnd we think that the -- there is no jurisdictional\nimpediment to a decision in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Government have\na position on what the answer would be? We've remanded\nit, but that's an open question. But does the\nGovernment have a position on whether these kinds of\nclaims would have to be heard by an Article III judge?\nMR. STEWART: Again, we don't have a\nposition with respect to the defamation claim. That is,\ndefamation claims may be personal injury claims in many\ncontexts, but in this statute, it's linked with wrongful\ndeath, which seems to -- to cut the other way. The\nactual counterclaim was not a defamation claim; it was a\ntortious interference claim. And we don't think that\nwould be a personal injury claim.\nWith respect to (b)(1), it says\nbankruptcy -- I see my time is up. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Englert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are three possible grounds for\naffirmance of the Ninth Circuit in this case, one\nconstitutional and two statutory; and the 157(b)(5)\nground which was preserved below received some\ndiscussion at the very end of Mr. Stewart's argument.\nBut I'd like to start the meat of my argument just the\nway Mr. Stewart started his argument, which is by\naddressing Justice Scalia's question, and like Mr.\nRichland, I'd like to talk about footnote 14 of the\nGranfinanciera opinion.\nNow, Granfinanciera had to distinguish\nSchor, which is the only case in which this Court has\never said a State law claim could be a public right so\nthat it could be adjudicated by a non-Article III forum\nand not subject to the Seventh Amendment. And Schor\nrested on a consent and waiver rationale and on a\nstructural rationale that an alternative Article III\nforum was made available by Congress for everyone in Mr.\nSchor's position.\nIn distinguishing Schor, this Court said in\nfootnote 14: \"Parallel reasoning is unavailable in the\ncontext of bankruptcy proceedings because creditors lack\nan alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to\npursue their claims.\" So with respect, this Court has\nalready answered the question Justice Scalia posed by\nsaying a creditor may not be put to that choice. Now,\nthe -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, that sort of\nbegs the question, because I think what I haven't\nunpackaged -- and I want you to unpackage it with me -\nyou're obviously not deprived of a State or Federal\ntrial forum to decide your claim.\nWhat you're -- what you're deprived of -\nyou can get your judgment. No one's telling you, you\ncan't go to those courts and get a declaration of your\nrights. What you're being told is you can't get paid on\nit. But that happens all of the time, either by the\nvagrancies of the fact that a debtor goes bankrupt and\ndoesn't file in the bankruptcy court or does file and\nthere's been a discharge.\nWhat you haven't said to me is what entitles\nyou, outside of equity, and what stops either a State\ncourt or a Federal -- a State legislature or\ncongressional legislature from saying, when someone is\nin bankruptcy, this is the res and these are the people\nwho are entitled to it? It's a separate claim. It's\nnot the State law claim. It may be measured by State\nlaw entitlement, but it's a separate claim. Why isn't\nit just a separate claim?\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay, Justice Sotomayor, in\nattempting to answer your question I'd like to\ndistinguish sharply between a claim of the creditor\nagainst the res, which is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's what you have\nto become to make that claim, meaning you would need to\nadjudicate your State law entitlement. You get a\njudgment saying she defamed you. Then what do you do\nwith that judgment?\nMR. ENGLERT: That judgment then is covered\nby the priority scheme of Federal bankruptcy laws, which\nare passed pursuant to congressional authority -\nconstitutional authority in Article I, section 8, clause\n4, which is why, in answer to the question Your Honor\nasked first of Mr. Richland, although the Court has\nnever squarely addressed it, it's broadly accepted that\nthere is no problem with adjudicating what would\notherwise be State law claims by the creditor against\nthe debtor in bankruptcy.\nIt's an entirely different subject when the\ndebtor tries to bring a claim against a creditor.\nThat's what Marathon addressed; that's what\nGranfinanciera addressed; that's what Katchen v. Landy\naddressed.\nNow, in Katchen v. Landy, the Court said the\ncase turned on or largely turned on the proposition that\nCongress had prescribed that the counterclaim, the\npreference avoidance counterclaim created by Act of\nCongress, must be adjudicated before the main claim\nagainst the res and against the debtor could or couldn't\nbe disallowed. And the Court returned to that theme in\nfootnote 14 of Granfinanciera saying: \"As Katchen makes\nclear, however, by submitting a claim against the\nbankruptcy estate, creditors subject themselves to the\ncourt's equitable power to disallow those claims.\" So\nto the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's my\nproblem, which is if Congress could do that, why can't\nit do what it did here, which is to say if you -- not to\nmake an equitable claim against the estate. It's not\ngoing to be in the amount of your judgment because\nthey're in bankruptcy because they can't pay your\njudgment. If you want a piece of this, you have to\nconsent to all claims, all compulsory claims -- let's\nnot try to get into the compulsory/permissive\ncategory -- to be adjudicated.\nOtherwise, like with preferences, there's an\nunfairness that makes this unequitable. You're asking\nthe estate to give you something, but you're not willing\nto submit in equity to deciding whether there's\nsomething you should give the estate back.\nMR. ENGLERT: And -- and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Compulsorily. I mean,\nyou know, not -- I'm trying to take the permissive issue\nout.\nMR. ENGLERT: Sure. And the answer, I\nreally do submit, is footnote 14 of Granfinanciera,\npointing out that there's nowhere else to go for a\ncreditor in bankruptcy, which distinguishes bankruptcy\nfrom Schor, in particular, but from all the other\nsettings in which the Court has said that by submitting\na claim, you subject yourself to the jurisdiction for\nall purposes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every -- every\nbankruptcy priority rule extinguishes someone's\nentitlement to money. The security rules mean the\npeople who have secured interests get paid before\nunsecured people get paid, and there are insider rules.\nEquity, as in terms of how the bankruptcy sets up the\nres, is at the vagrancies of the legislature.\nMR. ENGLERT: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They choose what they're\ngoing to permit you to take under what circumstances.\nSo why is it inequitable to -- to force you -- not to -\nto force you, we'll use that word -- to say if you want\nmoney from the res, what you trade off is letting the\ndebtor sue you for what you owe.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I don't know if it's\ninequitable, but it's certainly unconstitutional; and\nthe reason it's unconstitutional is because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't have a\nconstitutional right to collect your debt. You have a\nconstitutional right to have your claim adjudicated by a\ncourt.\nMR. ENGLERT: With respect -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can go to a -- well,\nonce you get the stay lifted at the end of the\ndischarge, you could sue the estate. You may not get a\njudgment that you can collect after that.\nMR. ENGLERT: With respect to the claim of\nthe creditor against the debtor and against the res, I\nhave no problem with that analysis. When the debtor,\ninstead of saying the res is limited and it can only be\ndistributed so far, instead says I get to bring my\ncounterclaim against the creditor in a non-Article III\nforum and the non-Article III forum gets to hear it and\ndetermine it, not just hear as 157(c)(1) says for\ncertain types of claims, then I suggest there is a\nconstitutional problem, at least with respect to claims\nthat neither, as in Katchen v. Landy, require rejection\nof the main claim, nor, as in Katchen v. Landy, are\ngoverned by Federal statute.\nThis is a State common law action for a\ntort, which has importance for 157(b)(5), which has\nimportance for 157(b)(2), and which has extremely high\nimportance for the constitutional question.\nIn Marathon, as everyone here knows, there\nwas no majority opinion, but one point very much in\ncommon between the plurality and the concurrence of\nJustice -- then-Justice Rehnquist, was that it mattered\na great deal that it was a common law claim under State\nlaw.\nHere we have a common law claim -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Without a proof of\nclaim?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. There was no proof of\nclaim in Marathon, so this case presents a different\nissue than Marathon does. But it does present\ncategorically the same kinds of issues presented in\nKatchen, Langenkamp, and Schor.\nThe only one of those cases that allowed a\nState common law claim to go forward -- a State common\nlaw counterclaim to go forward was Schor. And the\nCourt, as Mr. Richland correctly said, divided its\nopinion into a part dealing with the personal rights\nconferred by Article III, section 1, and the structural\nrights protected by Article III, section 1.\nIn the part about personal rights, the Court\nheld Mr. Schor had waived his personal right to an\nArticle III forum. In the part about structural rights\nat page 855 of that opinion, the Court said that it\nmattered to the constitutional analysis that Congress\nhad made an Article III forum available for pursuit of\nthat claim.\nSo it is terribly, terribly important\nwhether an Article III forum is available. When one is\nforced into a non-Article III forum, as Pierce Marshall\nwas, if he wanted to have any opportunity to collect\nfrom the res, saying that he thereby in some meaningful\nway consents and saying that the structural purposes of\nArticle III are not implicated is not in line with this\nCourt's cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert, something\nyou just said about if he had any opportunity -- I\nthought his position was this is a nondischargeable\ndebt. Even if it's discharged in bankruptcy, this debt\nwould survive.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wouldn't be wiped\nout? I mean, it would -\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh -- Justice Ginsburg, I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He would have another\nforum.\nMR. ENGLERT: He would have another forum\nagainst her post-bankruptcy assets after she had her -\nher pre-bankruptcy assets distributed. So it's a -\nit's a different kind of opportunity to recover from a\ndifferent set of assets. If he wanted to have any shot\nat any of her pre-bankruptcy assets, he did have to file\na proof of claim and not just a nondischargeability\ncomplaint.\nAnd let me clear up one very minor aspect of\nthe record while I'm talking about the proof of claim\nand the nondischargeability complaint. I doubt this\nends up mattering to the Court's decision, but Mr.\nRichland misspoke slightly when he said the counterclaim\ncame weeks after the proof of claim. The proof of claim\nwas June 12th. The counterclaim was June 14th, and in\nits very first paragraph, it says it is a counterclaim\nto the nondischargeability complaint. It doesn't\npurport to be a counterclaim to the proof of claim. I\ndoubt this ends up mattering, but it might be important\nfor this single purpose: It is inconceivable that this\nwas a compulsory counterclaim to the nondischargeability\ncomplaint. It might have been a compulsory counterclaim\nto the proof of claim, but not to the\nnondischargeability complaint.\nNow, I've explained why I believe -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just one more point about\nthe nondischargeability. He didn't have to bring that\nclaim, did he? I mean, if it's -- if it's a\nnondischargeable debt, he doesn't have to have the\nbankruptcy judge confirm that it's a nondischargeability\ndebt.\nMR. ENGLERT: Given -- I haven't studied\nclosely the interaction between the automatic stay of\nsection 362 and the nondischargeability complaint of\nsection 523, so I'm not 100 percent sure my answer to\nYour Honor is correct. But I believe that's not\ncorrect. I believe that in order to preserve the\nargument that something is nondischargeable, one does\nhave to go to the bankruptcy court under section 523 and\nseek a determination of nondischargeability.\nNow, the two statutory arguments are before\nthe Court, and I'd like to say something briefly about\neach of those two statutory arguments.\nWith regard to 157(b)(2), you have heard\nMr. Richland say this afternoon that the lower courts\nlimit subparagraphs (A) and (O) with the language\n\"arising in\" and \"arising under.\" You heard Mr.\nRichland say 157(b)(2)(C), subparagraph (C), doesn't\nneed to be so limited because it's so straightforward.\nBut the point is not how straightforward it\nis; the point is how broad and constitutionally dubious\nit is. And if the canon of constitutional avoidance\nmeans anything in limiting the scope of 157(b)(2), it\nshould have just as much application to (C) as it does\nto (A) and (O), and the -- it is not as analytically\nneat as some other cases of statutory interpretation,\nbut the most obvious way, if one is going to limit the\nreach of (C) as well as (A) and (O), to do so is to take\nthe words \"arising in\" and \"arising under\" just as Mr.\nRichland concedes they are used in limiting (A) and (O).\nThe alternative is to treat those words as\nsurplusage, and the alternative is to run headlong into\nthe constitutional issues.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you go back to that for\none second? I understand the due process issue, which\nis Brandeis's issue in Crowell. I think I can -- you're\nnot going to say anything that I can't read in the brief\non that. But the other one is worrying me, the\nstructural issue.\nSo imagine there's no due process concern\nwhatsoever. Now, when I looked at Crowell, your case\nwould seem to fall right in it. It is an adjudication\nunder the law as such, you know, between two people -\nwhatever that famous line is. You're captured by that\none. So the question is: Can you get out of it with\nlater cases? And you point to Schor to get out of it.\nAnd Schor, as I read it, is an all-factors\ncase, that when she talks in the structural part of -\nabout -- when Justice O'Connor is talking about the\nnon-due process part, the structural part, just what you\nsaid, that there isn't a hard-and-fast rule, that there\nare a bunch of factors that we should look at. At least\nthat's how I read it. And you were reading it as a\nhard-and-fast rule which means you win.\nNow -- now, who's -- should I just read this\ncase further and make up my mind about that, or is there\nsomething you want to say about it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, no, Justice Breyer, I\nthink I can agree with most or all of your premises and\nstill argue that we should win under the proper\nconstitutional analysis.\nThe point is not that the opinion of the\nCourt in Schor said in so many words that the\navailability of an alternative Article III forum is\ndispositive. The point is it has to be dispositive,\ngiven the larger sweep of this Court's cases, because\notherwise it is simply an all-factors test governing a\nstructural provision of the Constitution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you know, that's what\nshe says. And the -- and what you're interested in\nthere, the key thing is not fairness; the key thing is\nmaintaining the integrity of the judicial system. In\nCrowell, Justice Hughes says you've made that integrity\nas long as there were review of matters of fact, the\nindependent decision by a court of questions of law, and\nreservation to the court of constitutional facts which\nhave never been heard of since. Okay?\nSo we have this case. And your issue is,\nafter all, something that for many, many decades or\nlonger has been the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding.\nThe bankruptcy judge is an adjunct to the court. It is\nwell-established, this kind of review. Every part of\nCrowell is met. So what is -- what is essential to the\nintegrity of the judicial process that requires you to\nhave a de novo hearing before a district court rather\nthan the kind of review that's given here?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, those, with respect,\nYour Honor, I believe are the arguments that were\nrejected in Marathon.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In which case?\nMR. ENGLERT: In Marathon, in Northern\nPipeline v. Marathon.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, Marathon, you know,\nyou had four, four and -- and who knows what it stands\nfor. And then we have a sentence of what it stands for,\nand if you read that one sentence, I don't think you can\nsay it's a slam-dunk for you.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I'm not saying Marathon\nmakes this case a slam-dunk for me, Justice Breyer. I\nam saying Marathon rejects many, if not all, of the\npremises of your question, starting with -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of the -- of Marathon and\nsaying, where four and four judges really reject a\ndecision like Crowell, which is a kind of foundation\nstone?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, I'm suggesting that they\nreject one particular interpretation of Crowell, a very\nbroad interpretation of Crowell, because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, Crowell involved\npublic rights in the -- in the narrow sense, didn't it?\nIt was -- it was a public suit.\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: True, but it's also a -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And perhaps there should be\ndifferent standards. Even if you do not agree with my\nseparate opinion in Granfinanciera that that should be\nthe only category, there may well be different standards\nfor public suits in the narrow sense that were involved\nin Crowell and public suits which are -- are governed by\nsome totality of the circumstances test, which -\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I agree with that -\nexcuse me, Justice Scalia. I do agree with that, and I\nthink one doesn't have to adopt the reasoning of the\nconcurrence in the judgment in Granfinanciera to come to\nthat conclusion. I think part IV of Granfinanciera\nitself supports that proposition.\nBut I also think -- returning to Justice\nBreyer's question, I do think Marathon does stand for\ncertain propositions that this Court has accepted in\nlater cases and that -- and that do suggest that Crowell\nis not to be read broadly and that some of the\nlimitations on Crowell are the ones suggested in Justice\nScalia's questions.\nThe -- the thing that the concurrence, the\ntwo-justice concurrence in Marathon, agreed with the\nplurality on was that what was fundamental to the\ndisposition of that case was that the claim by the\ndebtor against the creditor was the stuff of common law\nat Westminster in 1789. It was a State law claim, not\nby the creditor against the debtor, but by the debtor\nagainst the creditor. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no\nbankruptcy court handle to start with. There was no\nclaim. If you're going to go back to equity, equity\nlays hold of a claim that fits within the equity court,\nand then, as you know, there were clean-up and clear-up\ndoctrines so they could decide the whole case.\nSo I think that the one thing one can say\nabout Marathon is that when the debtor has a claim\nagainst the creditor and the creditor hasn't made any\nclaim in the bankruptcy, he can't drag that into\nbankruptcy court. But once the bankruptcy court has\nauthority over the claim, the creditor's claim against\nthe debtor, then the court can clear up the whole\nmatter.\nMR. ENGLERT: If all we were talking about,\nJustice Ginsburg, were doctrines of equity, then perhaps\nAlexander v. Hillman would be the governing precedent, a\nnon-constitutional case later cited in a Seventh\nAmendment case and now attempts to be imported into an\nArticle III case.\nBut I do respectfully suggest that the\nConstitution places tighter limits on the authority of\nnon-Article III tribunals to adjudicate counterclaims\nthan just the general and very permissive rules that\nallowed equity courts to adjudicate counterclaims\nwithout -- Alexander v. Hillman was a case about whole\nEquity Rule 30 and whether it superseded section 51 of\nthe Judicial Code and its venue provisions and personal\njurisdiction provisions. If all we were talking about\nwere equity, that would be a fine analysis.\nBut I do read the collection of this Court's\ncases, including the crucial decisions in Katchen and\nLangenkamp which involved Federal counterclaims that by\nstatute defeated the main claim, and Schor, which I do\nbelieve relied heavily on the consent theory and on the\navailability of an Article III forum -- I do read that\ncollection of cases to suggest that there are tighter\nlimits on assigning State law claims and State law\ncounterclaims to non-Article III tribunals -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, by your theory,\nyou're basically saying that Congress cannot delegate\nany State law-based claim to which a jury is entitled to\nthe bankruptcy counterclaim at all. So if you have a\nclaim by lawyers for their fees in a defense of\nmalpractice, maybe they can adjudicate that, but they\ncan't adjudicate the malpractice claim. It would be a\ncounterclaim. Correct?\nMR. ENGLERT: I am saying that, Your Honor,\nbut let me say for a moment why that's not inefficient,\nwhy that's not such a surprising proposition. Remember,\nthe bankruptcy court can hear all of these claims unless\nthey're covered by 157(b)(5). It just can't determine\nthem.\nSo, the only thing we're talking about is\nthe standard of review. And with respect to -- it's not\na surprising proposition that the requirement of an\nArticle III forum does require that the district court,\nthe Article III court, decide those claims. So -- so\nthe -- my position is as broad as Your Honor's question\nsuggests, but the implications are not quite as broad as\nMr. Richland suggested when he said that an Article III\nforum always brings in inefficiency.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Englert, one real\ndifference between Marathon and this case is that\nCongress passed legislation in between which brought the\nbankruptcy judges under the control of the district\ncourts and made them entirely Article III entities. So\nyou can look at a case like Marathon -- I mean, not -\nsupervised by Article III entities, not by the\nPresident, not by Congress.\nSo one can look at a case like Marathon and\nsay the problem there was that the President appointed\nthe bankruptcy judges in a way that the President no\nlonger does and that the district courts did not have\nthe supervisory control over the bankruptcy judges in\nthe way that they do now, and that that makes a\nconstitutional difference.\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I would respectfully\nsubject -- suggest not, Justice Kagan, because there\nremains a difference between a non-Article III court and\nan Article III court, and the degree of supervision does\nnot convert the non-Article III court into an Article\nIII court. It simply means that we've gotten to this\nnon-Article III forum in a way that gives slightly\ntighter control to the judiciary.\nBut as a whole line of cases, including\nCrowell v. Benson, suggests, the degree of substantive\nreview of individual decisions by non-Article III\ntribunals matters. It's not just the front end at which\nthe judges or commissioners or whatever they are of the\nnon-Article III tribunal are selected. It's also the\nback end at which the Article III forum is either really\nmaking the Article III decisions or giving deferential\nreview to the decisions of a non-Article I court. So I\ndo think the problem is not solved simply by a different\nmethod of appointment of -- of bankruptcy courts.\nNow, if I may, I'd like to spend a few\nminutes on section 157(b)(5). It was interesting to me\nthat Mr. Stewart said the Government had no -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just clarify one point,\nMr. Englert. As I understand it, before the code was\namended, when the Federal courts were operating under\nthe interim rule, it was standard that the bankruptcy\njudges, given a claim against the estate, routinely\ndealt with counterclaims. Isn't that what the practice\nwas when the interim rule was in effect?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I believe the answer is\nyes, Justice Ginsburg. I can concede that point. But\nthere was, I believe, de novo review in district court.\nAnd in any event, the interim rules were in effect for a\nvery short time as the arc of constitutional decision\nmaking goes.\nMarathon was decided in 1982. Congress\npassed new legislation in 1984, and it took quite\nsometime for the interim rules to be put into effect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But did all of those court\nof appeals cases involve Article III claims? Did they\npass upon the Article III contention?\nIf not, it's -- it's our clear law that\nquestions -- jurisdictional questions that aren't raised\nand discussed are not decided for precedential purposes.\nHow -- how many of those cases grappled with the Article\nIII question?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- I don't have a case count\nfor you, Justice Scalia. Some did, I must concede that\nsome did, but certainly not all did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but not most, I\ndon't think.\nMR. ENGLERT: Not most, and they were only\ndecisions of -- of lower courts, not of this Court.\nNow, on the personal injury tort provision\nin section 157(b)(5), which, by the way, is also\nrepeated in 157(b)(2)(B) and in 157(b)(2)(O) to give\nemphasis to the fact that Congress really did not want\nbankruptcy judges trying personal injury tort claims.\nThe -- the greatest dispute before this Court is not\nwhether we are right about 157(b)(5). Mr. Richland in\nhis -- in his reply brief says we're not right, but I\nleave the Court to assess those arguments, but -- and\nMr. Stewart takes no position. The greatest dispute is\nwhether that issue was preserved for review.\nAnd I want to suggest to this Court that it\nwas clearly preserved for review. In the proof of claim\nfiled on June 12th, 1996, Mr. Marshall, Pierce Marshall,\nchecked the box indicating that he was filing a personal\ninjury tort claim. So from literally the first document\nthat potentially brought this issue before the\nbankruptcy court, it was noted that it was a personal\ninjury tort claim. Twenty-seven months passed before he\nmoved to withdraw the reference, that's true.\nWhat's not true is that anything had\nhappened on the defamation claim during those 27 months,\nand what's not true is that any court below held that\ndelay against Pierce Marshall. If you look at pages 109\nto 112 of the Joint Appendix filed in this Court, you\nwill see that the timeliness of the motion to withdraw\nthe reference was actually discussed in the motion\nitself. That's a matter easily accessible to this\nCourt.\nJudge Keller granted the motion to withdraw\nthe reference. He said, Pierce Marshall, you're right.\nThen he reversed himself. And you can find his ruling\nreversing himself at pages 138 to 139 of the Joint\nAppendix filed in this Court, but he did not reverse\nhimself on timeliness grounds.\nOur respectful submission is that by\ngranting the motion and then reversing on other grounds,\nhe clearly accepted its timeliness. In any event, the\nissue was clearly raised in the bankruptcy court and in\nthe district court -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, I just couldn't\nhear. On what grounds did he reverse himself, do you\nthink?\nMR. ENGLERT: He concluded that the\nbankruptcy court actually did have authority to hear the\nclaim and the counterclaim on the merits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if we were to decide\nthis case, and suppose we decide every other question\nand suppose you lost, then wouldn't we send it back for\nyou -- if you're right on that, for the Ninth Circuit to\ndecide about that as an independent basis for no\njurisdiction?\nMR. ENGLERT: Given the premise that I've\nlost every other issue, the Court could either -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I had to make that premise\nin order to -\nMR. ENGLERT: No, no, I understand. I\nunderstand, but given the premise, the Court could then\neither then reach an alternative ground for affirmance,\nwhich is well within the ordinary operation of this\nCourt's rules or send it back. But let me suggest that\nthere is a reason, and I believe a -- a question from\none member of the bench earlier suggested that there\nmight be a reason to reach the 157(b)(5) issue, and to\nput it colloquially and directly, the 157(b)(5) issue is\neasy. The constitutional question is hard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is?\nMR. ENGLERT: Is easy. The constitutional\nquestion is hard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's that hard, why\ndon't we just DIG the case? I guess that -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ENGLERT: No, but really, the 157(b)(5)\nquestion is -- is easy, but the strongest argument\nMr. Richland makes on the merits of the 157(b)(5) claim\nis that Congress meant only bodily injury when it\nreferred to personal injury. But section 522(d)(11) of\nthe code uses the term \"bodily injury,\" so we know that\nwhen Congress means bodily injury, it says bodily\ninjury. It's also been suggested that the phrase\n\"personal injury or wrongful death\" is a phrase to which\nthe canons of interpretation, noscitur a sociis and\nejusdem generis, somehow apply. That's not why Congress\nused \"personal injury or wrongful death.\"\nUntil 1846, with Lord Campbell's Act, the\ncommon law of England was that a wrongful death claim\ndidn't survive, couldn't be brought by the -- by the\nheirs, because the victim of the tort was dead.\nIt is quite common all around the country to\nuse the phrase \"personal injury or wrongful death\" to\nmake clear that the tort being covered is a tort that\nresulted in injury to someone who survived or is a tort\nthat resulted in death. So there's nothing surprising\nabout the use of that phrase. It doesn't mean bodily\ninjury. And for those who look at legislative history,\nthere is legislative history indicating quite\nemphatically that the members of Congress who were\nresponsible for adding 157(b)(5), amending 157(b)(2)(B),\namending 157(b)(O), and putting the abstention\nprovisions in section 1334(c) really meant for\nbankruptcy judges to keep their hands off personal\ninjury claims.\nThe main claim in this case that conceivably\ncould have given the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, if I\nlose on the other issues, was Pierce's defamation claim,\nnot Vickie's intentional interference claim. We would\nrespectfully suggest they're both personal injury tort\nclaims, but it's particularly clear that Pierce's\ndefamation claim is an injury to his personal interest\nin reputation.\nSo either by resolving the constitutional\nissue or through the canon of constitutional avoidance,\nor simply because it is the best reading of 157(b)(2),\nthis Court should affirm the Ninth Circuit. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Richland, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICHLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me address immediately this question of\nwhether Judge Keller effectively denied this -- this\nwithdrawal motion on timeliness grounds or not, because\nthat truly is the easy way of resolving this personal\ninjury question. The substantive question of whether\nthese particular torts fall within the personal injury\nexception is a most difficult one, and it is one that\nthis Court really shouldn't take on unless there's a\nsubstantial amount more of briefing and input from -\nfrom others.\nBut the waiver issue is an easy one, and the\nreason it's an easy one is the record is undisputed that\nit was 27 months between the time that this claim -\ncounterclaim was -- claim was filed and between the time\nthat this personal injury issue was raised in a\nwithdrawal motion. During that period of time there\nwere numerous sanctions motions and numerous sanctions,\ndiscovery sanctions imposed upon Pierce Marshall. And,\nin fact, what happened was Judge Keller, before\nconsidering the initial withdrawal motion on the\nmerits -- before having a hearing on it, he initially\ngranted the withdrawal. He then had a hearing, and at\nthe hearing what he said was -- he may not have used the\nword \"timeliness,\" but what he said was you've chosen\nthis forum, the bankruptcy court is immersed in this\ncase, and he used the colorful phrase what you are\nexperiencing here is the spawn of what you have begot.\nAnd I think that that clearly imports the\nnature that you are too late, you have not brought this\nin a timely fashion; everything that has happened in the\nbankruptcy court has made it too late for you to come to\nthis court at this time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would take that to\nmean you -- you brought it in here, and, you know, the\nsame kind of argument that you were making.\nMR. RICHLAND: And that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Volenti non fit injuria.\nYou chose to come into the court, and this is the spawn\nof your coming in.\nMR. RICHLAND: And the bankruptcy court is\nso immersed in this because of what has gone on during\nthe bankruptcy proceedings that it is not appropriate\nfor me to withdraw it. That seems to connote clearly\nthe notion that it is not timely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would -- well, I would\nrather say 27 months is too long. That's --\nMR. RICHLAND: And that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's timely.\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, 27 months is a long\ntime in bankruptcy.\nLet me clear up this issue of whether the\ncounterclaim was to the proof of claim or to the\ndischargeability. On the appendix to the petition, page\n379, it is quite clearly stated that it was in response\nto 170 -- 157(b)(2)(C). That is a counterclaim to a\nperson who has filed a claim.\nOn -- with respect to this issue of State\nlaw having some great significance here as opposed to\nFederal law, that issue has been rejected by this Court.\nIn the Schor case, the majority opinion states very\nclearly that, in fact, there is no significance to the\nfact that -- that something is a State law claim as\nopposed to a Federal claim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but his basic\nargument I think is that in Marathon -\nMR. RICHLAND: There is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Make it totally fair.\nNobody is being treated unfairly. Structurally, it does\ninjure the -- the prestige or something or the structure\nor the integrity of the Federal Government -- judiciary,\nFederal judiciary -- to allow the bankruptcy judge to\nadjudicate a direct claim; why is a counterclaim\ndifferent?\nMR. RICHLAND: Well, I understand that\nargument, but the majority opinion in Schor states that\nthe State law character of a claim, quote, \"has no\ntalismanic power in Article III inquiries.\" That's 478\nat 853.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
