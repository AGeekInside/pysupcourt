        "content": "[11:03 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Evans versus Chavis.\nMs. Chatman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE BAKER CHATMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. CHATMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit decision in the court below\nwas wrong, for three reasons. It adopted a rule that\nfrustrates Congress's intent to protect Federal Courts\nfrom hearing stale claims and to respect the finality\nof State Court convictions. It does so by improperly\nand arbitrarily adopting a conclusive presumption that\nmisunderstands or ignores State law and practice. And\nit is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Carey\nversus Saffold.\nIf the Federal Courts, on the other hand,\ncomplete their analysis of the Federal question of\ntolling the AEDPA statute of limitations by deciding\nwhether a State petition was timely before granting\ntolling, it can properly dismiss more Federal petitions\non statute-of-limitations grounds and can avoid\nlitigating stale claims on the merits. Any\ndifficulties in doing so can be ameliorated by the\nlimited nature of the State-law inquiry and adoption of\na 60-day presumption of timeliness.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's something --\nwhere would we -- we would just pick that number, that\n--\nMS. CHATMAN: The 60 days?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Because that's a\nnormal appeal period?\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, when\nCalifornia does look to timeliness in proceeding from\none lower court to a higher court, then we see that it\ncontemplates that a -- that a litigant will proceed in\n60 days or less, because -- and the reason we have to\nturn to analogies is because nothing in California law\nrequires the appellate courts in State habeas to look\nto that particular period of time between the lower\ncourt decision and proceeding to that court, because\nthey're courts of original jurisdiction. So, they look\nat how long the prisoner proceeded from conviction to\ntheir court, as a whole.\nBut the reason that we need to figure out\nthis period is because this Court, in Carey versus\nSaffold, has said that our system functions enough like\nan appellate system to bring those periods into the\ntolling provision. So, when --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can't --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- we look --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the -- can't the\nCalifornia courts adopt a -- give us a 60-day rule, or\na 30-day rule, or a 90-day rule? And if they don't do\nit, why should we do it?\nMS. CHATMAN: Up to this point, they have not\ndone so. And I think that is because, as I said, they\nare looking at the time from conviction. How long did\nit take the prisoner to get to their court with their\nclaims? And how -- and how long they take properly\nproceeding up the ladder through the courts is just one\nfactor that they look at. And they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know how this came\nabout. I mean -- I mean, I'm asking both sides the\nsame question. It'll sound very favorable to you, but\nif you answer it just yes, because it's favorable to\nyou, I might learn, later, I was wrong, and you won't\nhave had a chance to answer. So, I want your honest\nopinion on this. I don't know how this happened. And\nI don't know -- did you ask for en banc?\nMS. CHATMAN: I'm sorry, how the 3-year delay\nhappened?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I don't know how the\nCalifornia Court could have read the opinion -- which,\nof course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading\nthings into it that weren't there -- but I don't know\nhow any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come\nto this conclusion. I thought that it said, you know,\non -- that there are three issues -- what's the word\n\"pending\"? Does the word \"pending\" apply to the time\nperiod between when the lower court decides a case and\nyou appeal? That's typically 20 days or 30 days.\nMS. CHATMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are those 20 days or 30 days\ncounted in the tolling period? I thought part one\nclearly said the answer is yes. Then we looked at\nCalifornia, and they don't have the words \"20 days\" or\n\"30 days.\" They say \"reasonable time.\" And then we\nsaid, \"Still applies, because 'reasonable time' is\nprobably 20 or 30 days.\" They don't have a radically\ndifferent rule; it's a similar rule. Then we come to\npart three, and it says, \"This is 45 days.\" There's --\nno 4 and a half months, wasn't it?\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This isn't just 20 or 30\ndays.\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, is it timely?\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, there, I thought the\nCourt said -- I mean, I was reading it -- say, \"Well,\nit's hard to say, because there might have been excuses\nfor the delay.\" What about the words that were written\nthere, \"on the merits\"?\nMS. CHATMAN: And there was an equitable- --\nJUSTICE BREYER: On --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- -tolling question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that had nothing to --\nMS. CHATMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- do with the case. The\nlack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of\nthe case. But, what about the words \"on the merits\"?\nAnd there, what I think the court wrote is that the\nfact that it says \"on the merits\" doesn't prove it --\nwhat -- it doesn't prove that it was timely. Why? And\nthen I listed a bunch of reasons. There are reasons.\nSometimes courts say \"on the merits,\" even though it's\ndelayed. All right? They say \"on the merits.\" Or\nbecause they want to tell the prisoner or -- there are\na lot of reasons why, all of which are listed. So, we\nsend it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month\ndelay, given the excuses, was still timely. We -- all\nright?\nMS. CHATMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now --\nMS. CHATMAN: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- we now get a case where\nit's 3 years.\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the court says, \"It's\ntimely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'\"\nBut I thought -- I said, in the opinion, I thought the\ncourt adopted that the words \"on the merits\" do not\ndecide the matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what do you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- worse than that?\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- do in those\ncircumstances?\nMS. CHATMAN: Justice Breyer, I could not\nagree --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but did --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- with you more.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you ask for rehearing en\nbanc? Because any judge, including me, can make a\nmistake. What did you do?\nMS. CHATMAN: We petitioned for certiorari in\nthis Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you didn't ask for a\nhearing en banc.\nMS. CHATMAN: No, we did not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why, when you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- get a fair -- because any\njudge can make a mistake --\nMS. CHATMAN: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- why don't you just go and\nask the Ninth Circuit to say, \"Look, this is not --\nread the opinion, read what they said. Correct it.\"\nMS. CHATMAN: This is not the first time that\nwe have tried to take that approach with the Ninth\nCircuit on this issue. They -- on remand, in Saffold\nversus Carey, they made the same mistake, and the\nrehearing has got us nowhere -- asking for a rehearing.\nAnd so, we felt that in order to get this clarified as\nsoon as possible, it seems futile to ask for rehearing\nwhen on the -- when we had not been successful before.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Well this --\nMS. CHATMAN: This is, by the way --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- this case is different,\nactually, from the one that Justice Breyer put,\nbecause, in this case, the California Supreme Court\ndidn't say --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"on the merits.\" It said\nnothing at all. It just disposed of it. So, the\nquestion presented is quite different.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's worse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's whether -- not whether\nit can be, nonetheless, timely when they say \"on the\nmerits,\" but whether it can be, nonetheless, timely\nwhen they don't say anything at all.\nMS. CHATMAN: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think it's an a\nfortiori case, in other words.\nMS. CHATMAN: And the Ninth Circuit is\ntreating it as if it were the same sort of decision\nthat was before this Court in Carey versus Saffold. It\nis a decision on the merits. And they are reading that\nas excluding any other possible grounds that might have\nexisted for the denial in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're representing the\nattorney general of California, and you have a lot of\nlitigation in the Ninth Circuit. It's -- I mean, the\nother side's going to answer on the merits, if they\ncan. And they're in an awkward position here, I\nunderstand. But I need to know what to -- what do you\nthink we should do? I mean, here, we write an opinion,\nand they --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it seems to perhaps,\ninadvertently or not -- and the reason I turn to you\nis, judges are busy, they have huge dockets --\nMS. CHATMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, often, unless it's very\nclearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take\naction, you get -- waste everybody's time and money.\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh. Well, I think the\nanswer is to instruct the Federal Courts that, when\nthey're undertaking this inquiry of whether an\napplication is pending during the intervals, a Federal\nquestion that has a State-law component, then they must\napply the State law to figure out if it's timely. And,\nyou know, as this Court said in Carey the -- versus\nSaffold -- it's a matter of whether it's timely; it's\nnot a matter of the basis of the State Court decision.\nAnd in the context of California, I think the answer\nis to adopt a presumption of 60 days, because that is\nthe most analogous --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- even if, as he\nalleged, he was unable to do anything in --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a layperson. He\nsaid, \"I tripped in the intermediate appellate court,\nbecause I didn't do any research. And so, I wanted to\ndo better, but they gave me a job where, during the\nhours that the library was open\" --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"I had to be at work.\nAnd that's why it took me all this time.\"\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, is that -- suppose\nthe prison locks down someone and says, \"You can't go to\nthe library.\"\nMS. CHATMAN: This is an easy decision for\nthe Federal Court, even on these facts. Okay, this\nPetitioner has taken longer than 60 days, and he's\noffered an explanation. But if you look at his\nexplanation, on its face, it's completely inadequate to\naccount for a 3-year delay, because he doesn't take\naction to get -- to get library access for an entire\nyear after the Court of Appeals decision denying his\napplication is issued. Then he spends 3 months, quite\ncorrectly, going through the administrative procedures\nof the prison to get a job change. And he does, in\nfact, get a job change 3 months later -- about 3 months\nlater. Then, he waits still more than another year\nbefore he files his petition in the California Supreme\nCourt presenting essentially the same claims, same\nfacts, same law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, he\ndelays, after he gets the library access, for an extra\nyear.\nMS. CHATMAN: Yes, he does. Now, he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, is there any excuse\nthey're making for that? Because if you don't tell me,\nthey're --\nMS. CHATMAN: Later on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- going to tell me.\nMS. CHATMAN: -- later on, once he gets to\nFederal Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. CHATMAN: -- he offers the explanation\nthat the prison was on lockdowns. There are several\nproblems with that assertion; the first being, it\nwasn't presented to the State Court, so it's -- it\ncannot cure his State untimeliness. The second being\nthat he doesn't offer specific dates or explain how it\nprevented him from filing his petition. And the third\nproblem is that State prisons provide procedures during\nlockdowns to get library materials to prisoners.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask a rather probably\nsort of stupid question? But I gather there are a\nlarge number of these cases disposed of by a postcard.\nWould there be anything wrong if the California\nSupreme Court said, \"We're going to have two postcards.\nOne says that 'the delay was unreasonable, denied';\nand the other said, 'there's nothing to the merits,\ndenied'\" -- you use two postcards -- wouldn't that solve\nall the problems?\nMS. CHATMAN: The problem with that is --\ncertainly, it would solve things, but the problem with\nthat is, it would require the -- require the California\ncourts to make both of those determinations in every\ncase. And, as it is now, they use a procedure much\nlike --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they could adopt a 60-\nday rule, or a 90-day rule, and then just, when they\ndecided to not follow the rule, they'd put a check on -\n- say, \"Well, we did look at the merits in this case.\"\nMS. CHATMAN: They could do that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under our current law, it\nwouldn't make any difference, would it? Because even if\nthey sent the \"on the merits\" postcard, Carey versus\nSaffold says --\nMS. CHATMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't matter.\nMS. CHATMAN: That's true. And that is why I\nsay they would have to make both determinations,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, may --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it might --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- may I -- no, go ahead.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nsay, it might matter if they had another postcard that\nsaid it's untimely, and they didn't send that. That\nwould be a whole different situation, right?\nMS. CHATMAN: That's true, but we are -- we\nare engaging here in trying to tell the California\nState Courts how to dispose of these cases, which I am\nreally not sure is an appropriate thing for us to do.\nThey're --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- using a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- procedure --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we decided it -- it\nwas at least appropriate to give a hint, aren't we in a\nlittle bit better position than you suggested, in the\nlight of Carey? Because in -- is -- correct me if I'm\nwrong, but I thought, in Carey, the State order was not\nmerely that it was on the merits, but that it was on\nthe merits and it was untimely. In other words, it\nsaid A and B. And we said, you know, \"That's\nambiguous,\" to start with, and then we went on and\nsaid, \"You know, sometimes 'merits' don't mean merits.\"\nBut if the State were to revise its procedure and say,\n\"We're either going to say A or we're going to say B,\nand that's our reason,\" and they said, \"It's on the\nmerits\" or \"it's untimely,\" wouldn't it make sense for\nus, even in the light of Carey, to say, \"Okay, we'll\naccept that as the -- as the State's reason\"?\nMS. CHATMAN: If they were to do that. But I\ndon't anticipate the State Courts adopting that\npractice, because it would double their work. They\nwould have to make both decisions, merits and\nuntimeliness.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't --\nMS. CHATMAN: It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- see why. If they're\ngoing to follow something like a prima facie 60-day\nrule, and it's -- it's on day 65, all they've got to\nsay is, \"It's untimely.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in this --\nMS. CHATMAN: But the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in this case, in order to\ndetermine it was untimely, they would have presumably\nhad to have gone into the factual analysis of whether\nthe prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a\nyear after getting the materials, and all of that\nstuff. So, it's a lot easier for them, when the merits\nof it seem to them absolutely clear, to simply deny it\non the merits and not reach the \"timely\" question.\nMS. CHATMAN: And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the \"timely\" question is\nstill before Federal Courts. That's what we said in\nCarey versus Saffold. So --\nMS. CHATMAN: I agree. And they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- although they can avoid\nit, we can't.\nMS. CHATMAN: And that -- and that is the way\nthe State Courts are approaching these cases. They,\nfor the most part, will look first for a prima facie\ncase, and in -- much like the Federal Courts do in\nFederal habeas under Rule 4, where they scream for\nfrivolous petitions that can be dismissed outright\nwithout asking for a response from the warden or\ninstituting briefing, then they can deny those\nsummarily. And the reason why they cannot just decide\ntimeliness is because then the Ninth Circuit will\ninterpret that as not reaching the merits, and we will\nhave a problem of deference. So, if they were to\ndecide one explicitly, they'd have to decide the other,\nthe way things stand now. And I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- as a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I must say, I don't\nquite follow the -- why couldn't they simply say it's\nuntimely? Wouldn't that -- that it -- there was -- it\nwas not pending during this period, because it -- 3\nyears elapsed, and that's unreasonable. Wouldn't that\nend the case?\nMS. CHATMAN: It would, but it's not a State-\nlaw question. They don't -- whether it's pending\nduring that period is not a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- State law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but whether --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- question, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- it was a reasonable time\nto file is a State-law question.\nMS. CHATMAN: Whether he took a reasonable\ntime from the lower -- from time of conviction to their\ncourt is the only State-law question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, isn't the --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- because of the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't the --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- original --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- California Supreme Court\nsometimes decide that the time between the intermediate\ncourt's decision and the filing in the California\nSupreme Court -- don't they ask whether that was\nreasonable?\nMS. CHATMAN: I have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or they only relate it back\nto the day of the conviction?\nMS. CHATMAN: I have only seen one case in\nCalifornia where they specifically addressed that\nparticular interval because the Attorney General raised\nit, and that's Moss -- In Re Moss, which is cited\nin the red brief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask that, if you had\na case in which the Attorney General raised the -- say,\nthis case, and yet -- and say California Supreme Court\nwrote an opinion in which it said, \"Now, 3 years has\ngone by, but the prisoner has given us a very elaborate\nexplanation,\" as Justice Ginsburg suggested, \"and we\nfind that explanation sufficient; therefore, we\nconclude that, even though it was 3 years, it was a\nreasonable time; and, therefore, we're going to address\nthe merits. And we now address the merits and say you\nlose.\" Now, in that case, would it be pending, for our\npurposes?\nMS. CHATMAN: Yes, because the State Court\nfound it timely, and that would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would? I thought --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- that would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that was --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- the end of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- an open --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- the matter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- question, frankly. I\nmean, I can't imagine California would do this, but I\nguess if California did say that, \"The period of time\nbetween the time you lost in the District Court and the\ntime you filed, in every other State, is 30 days, but,\nin California, it's a reasonable time. And what we\nmean by a 'reasonable time' is 3 years, without any\nexcuses\" -- I guess, then, maybe the dissent in Carey\nv. Saffold would have been right in respect to that.\nMS. CHATMAN: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would have said that that\nisn't pending under Federal law, whether California\nsays it or not. So, the role of the Federal law versus\nthe State law, I thought we left open.\nMS. CHATMAN: I think this Court, in Carey\nversus Saffold, and in Pace versus DiGuglielmo, has\nstressed the importance of deferring to State-law\ndeterminations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you can't --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- State Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- defer to something --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- determinations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- under this statute, where\nCongress wrote the word \"pending.\" And I wouldn't\nhave thought they did have in mind a --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- State that says, \"It's\npending, even though you have no excuse and didn't file\nanything for 3 years, your appeal.\" Now, I haven't\nheard that fully briefed and so forth, so I hesitate to\nexpress a final conclusion on it. But it --\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- since it's never going to\ncome up, I don't think, I don't know I have to have a\nfinal conclusion.\nMS. CHATMAN: I don't think so. But it's\npending -- it's pending while -- if it's timely under\nState law. And if the State Court has already spoken\nto State law, I don't know that there's a question left\nfor the Federal Court. I think -- I think they say,\n\"Okay, this was timely, and, therefore, pending during\nthe interval.\" But --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, you want us to apply\na presumption that a petition is timely if it's filed\nwithin 60 days. But California doesn't apply such a\npresumption, does it?\nMS. CHATMAN: No, it does --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- not, but --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- where do we get that?\nI mean, where does that come from?\nMS. CHATMAN: Where that comes from is, if\nyou look to the closest analogous State procedures --\nsay, direct appeal from a conviction -- then you're\nallowed 60 days to go to the next -- to the appellate\ncourt. Similarly, if the State appeals the grant of\nhabeas relief -- the State, unlike the defendant, can\nappeal -- then the State gets 60 days. So, when\nCalifornia thinks -- when California quantifies the\nconcept of reasonableness in the appellate context,\nthey do so in terms of 60 days or less. And I say \"or\nless,\" because State habeas is actually supposed to be\na quicker process than the appellate process.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, shouldn't we leave\nit to California to adopt such a presumption?\nMS. CHATMAN: California's not going to do\nthat, because it's not a State-law question. It's just\nnot a State-law question. But it's -- I think it's\nacceptable for a Federal Court to adopt a presumption\nto assist them in deciding a State-law issue, much --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- the way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- good would the --\nwhat good would the presumption do if it's just a\npresumption? Presumably, if it's a presumption, the\nprisoner is --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- going to say,\n\"Well, here's why you shouldn't follow the presumption\nin my case,\" just as, if it looks like he's waited a\nlong time, he's going to say, \"Well, here's why that\ndelay was reasonable.\" I don't know that the\npresumption you're proposing serves much of a purpose.\nMS. CHATMAN: The value of a 60-day\npresumption is that it saves the Federal Court from\nhaving to look at the State-law time -- of the\ntimeliness in that particular case and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it doesn't --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- it ought --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- not if the\nprisoner says, \"Here's why you shouldn't follow the\npresumption.\"\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, that's true. But if it -\n- but if he files within 60 days, there's no need to\nlook further or consider his argument regarding\ntimeliness. And the other value in the 60-day --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why phrase it as a\npresumption? Why not phrase it, \"We determine\nCalifornia law to be, unless we hear otherwise, having\nexamined what it does in other situations, that 60 days\nis timely\"?\nMS. CHATMAN: I think that would be perfectly\nfair.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same thing. But I\nwouldn't call it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a presumption.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that's a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then the -- you know,\nthe incarcerated individual can come forward with\nexcuses and say that, \"California would make an\nexception to the 60-day rule for this,\" and we're back\nwhere we were.\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, that would be fair, and\nit would accomplish the other thing that I offered the\n60-day presumption to accomplish, is to offer a sort of\nsafe harbor where the Petitioner knows that he gets\ntolling for 60 days, and need not file a protective\npetition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it would --\nMS. CHATMAN: So, it alleviates that problem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- it would -- it would be\nfair, but to call it a finding of California State law\nis a -- would be a bit of a stretch, wouldn't it? I\nmean, you -- you've made a perfectly good argument that\nit would be a sensible rule for California --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to adopt, would not be\nsensible for us to adopt. But I'd have a hard time\nsaying that I could justify it as a statement of\ncurrent California law, and I'm --\nMS. CHATMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am I missing something?\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, Justice Souter, I think\nit works very well as a presumption adopted by the\nFederal Courts for ease of administrability and, you\nknow, at the same time, reflecting State law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, the --\nMS. CHATMAN: But the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're back to the\npresumption. But --\nMS. CHATMAN: Right. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but if --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- but the one thing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we're going to go\nfurther and say, \"Oh, well, we find that that's what\nthe State law is, unless they tell us differently,\"\nthat's where I'm having trouble.\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, it's not very different\nfrom when the Federal Courts adopt a State statute of\nlimitations --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but we --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- for a Federal --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- know what it --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- cause of action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- we know what it is.\nThere's a State statute of limitations. It says --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- 3 years.\nMS. CHATMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We don't have anything like\nthat here.\nMS. CHATMAN: By analogy, you know that the\nperiod of time for seeking direct appeal is 60 days.\nSo, it is -- it's deciding something by analogy, in\nmuch the same way the Federal Courts do for a Federal\ncause of action that has no statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How many cases are there on\nhabeas in California every year, about?\nMS. CHATMAN: Oh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean about. Just give\nme the rough ballpark.\nMS. CHATMAN: I would -- there are about\n8,000, I would say.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, the -- in\nthe Supreme Court.\nMS. CHATMAN: No. In the Supreme Court, I\nwould say it is more like about 2500.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, there are 25- -- so\nthere are several thousand cases every year.\nMS. CHATMAN: Thousands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Thousands.\nMS. CHATMAN: Thousands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, I don't know what\nI'm doing with California procedure when I pass a --\npass a law, is what it would be. Write a rule, write a\npresumption. I have no idea what I'm doing there.\nThey've worked out a system. But I don't -- why\ndoesn't it work just to say to the lower courts, \"Do\nyour job\"? What we said -- and maybe it wasn't\nexpressed clearly -- maybe -- \"Courts, look, it says\n'reasonable time.' All right? Now, reasonable time,\nin every other State is 30 days, sometimes 20 days.\"\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Sometimes the most, 60\ndays. So, look and see if it was filed within a\nreasonable time. That's all. And if California passes\n-- some specific thing says something special about it,\nof course, pay attention to that.\" What's wrong with\nthat? They just would do it like they do any other\nthing of deciding what happens in --\nMS. CHATMAN: That is -- that is exactly what\nI would ask this Court to do. Exactly -- is to --\nFederal Courts take on this Federal question of tolling\nand complete the analysis by applying State law to find\nout if these petitions were timely filed in merit\ntolling.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is \"reasonable time\" the\nissue, or is it what California would consider a\n\"reasonable time\"? I mean, that's the problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that is the problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not --\nMS. CHATMAN: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- making up, for ourselves,\nwhat's a reasonable time. If California says a year is\na reasonable time, that would be the reasonable time at\nissue, wouldn't it?\nMS. CHATMAN: I don't think it would be, in\nlight of --\n-- in light of the analogous\nState law that you only get 60 days to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but if --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- appeal, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the California Supreme\nCourt says, \"Despite all of these, in this kind of a\nsituation, we think a year is a reasonable time\" --\nMS. CHATMAN: But they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- haven't said so. The -- of\ncourse, you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but if they said so\n--\nMS. CHATMAN: If they said so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that would be binding --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- if they had --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on us, wouldn't it?\nMS. CHATMAN: If they said so, then we'd have\nState law, and we would have to apply that. But we\ndon't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would you have to\napply that? It's a Federal question whether the claim\nis pending or not during that whole period, right?\nMS. CHATMAN: Of -- certainly it is.\nCertainly it is. But, at the end of the analysis,\nthere is a little bit of State-law analysis. It has to\nbe timely under State law. And if California Supreme\nCourt tells us more about what's timely under their\nreasonableness standard, then I think you would have to\ntake that into account.\nBut the concept of reasonableness and due\ndiligence that are employed in States -- in\nCalifornia's timeliness standards, I don't think\n\"reasonableness\" and \"due diligence\" mean anything\ndifferent at the Federal courthouse in Sacramento than\nthey do at the State Court of Appeal five blocks away,\nor in this Court. It's -- these are common terms that\nare used in the law all the time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? I\nthink our opinion the last time around suggested that\npossibility would certify into the California --\nMS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Supreme Court, and that\nwas not done. Was any other effort made that you can\ntell us about? Maybe you should, off the record, but\nto try and get the guidance of the California Supreme\nCourt on the -- on the State-law problem here? Has\nanybody suggested to the court they might adopt a rule\nor a different practice or anything like that?\nMS. CHATMAN: Your Honor, yes, we have\nsuggested that. The California Supreme Court -- and,\nas you said, this is not within the record -- the\nCalifornia -- but, if I may, the California Supreme\nCourt has declined to adopt a rule. They think it's a\npolitical question that has to be decided by the\nLegislature. And the Legislature, to date, has not\nadopted a rule or -- not a rule, a statute of\nlimitations for these cases. And I have to say that,\nif they undertook that, then there would be certain\ncosts to doing that, as well. You know, we would -- we\nwould -- we would ease this issue, but we would\nconfront the cost of considerable litigation, I would\nimagine, if we adopted a new statute for collateral\nrelief in California. So, there's a cost to doing\nthat, that might outweigh the benefits of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMS. CHATMAN: -- clarifying this issue.\nIf I may reserve my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Stris.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. STRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn light of Justice Breyer's questions, I\nfeel compelled to begin with a brief explanation of why\nthis case is a necessary consequence of Saffold. And,\nalthough it wasn't my initial intention to speak\nplainly, what I would suggest is that the problem is\nnot the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case, but,\nrather, California's timeliness standards. And the\nproblem that's presented by this case is one of Federal\nline-drawing. And it presents serious federalism,\ncomity, and fairness concerns. And if we could step\nback from the facts of this case for a moment -- and I\nwill discuss them -- I think it -- I hope, at least, it\nwill become clear that the Ninth Circuit, in light of\nwhat it's dealing with in California, adopted the only\nsensible rule.\nSo, the place to begin in answering some of\nyour questions, Justice Breyer, is with California's\ntimeliness standards. And to give some background, I\nwould start with the principle that was articulated in\nthe Warden's brief and that the California Supreme\nCourt has articulated, which is that California does\nenforce its timeliness standards. It's usually done by\n-- in the summary-denial context, by citing to In re\nSwain or In re Robbins --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I missed it. You said the\nproblem is, California doesn't \"support\" or \"import\"?\nI just didn't --\nMR. STRIS: Oh, I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- hear your word.\nMR. STRIS: -- apologize.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- the -- I just didn't\nhear what you said.\nMR. STRIS: What I had said is that\nCalifornia does enforce its --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Enforce.\nMR. STRIS: -- timeliness standards. And the\nway they customarily do that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what are those\nstandards, please?\nMR. STRIS: Okay. The standards are that a\nprisoner must file within a reasonable time. And that\nrequires a two-part inquiry, Justice O'Connor. The\nfirst part is, Was there substantial delay? It's\ndetermined based upon a set standard, when the delay\nbegins. But California's never articulated any\nstandards for what period of time constitutes\n\"substantial.\" That's the first problem. It's\nessentially an ad hoc determination that's made by\nindividual California Courts. And that's why former\nJustice Brown described that as \"an abstraction,\" and\nformer Justice Moss described it as \"vague and\nindeterminate at its very core.\" But that's what the\nNinth Circuit is dealing with when it reviews these\ncases.\nSo, to put it context for a moment, the way\nthe State Courts do enforce this on a case-by-case\nbasis, to be practical, is, the State Supreme Court\noften summarily dismisses cases on procedural bars,\nincluding timeliness. And, to give you some statistics\nfrom the Warden's brief, in 2004 there were 1,223\nunexplained summary denials -- in other words, just\ndenied -- and there were 1,174 denials with a citation\nto a case. And this is significant, because this means\nthat, in about half of the cases in 2004 that went to\nthe California Supreme Court, they enforced one of\ntheir procedural bars, and, in many of them, it was\ntimeliness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. A case that was a\nprocedural-bar case?\nMR. STRIS: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I\nfollow the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you --\nMR. STRIS: -- question, Justice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you could summarily deny\nand cite a case that showed you were denying on the\nmerits.\nMR. STRIS: Oh. What I -- what I was\nsuggesting is that there were 1,174 cases that were\nprocedural-bar cases, where it said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where they cited a\nprocedural-bar case.\nMR. STRIS: That's correct.\nIt would say, \"Denied, In Re Swain,\" meaning\ndenied for being untimely. As opposed, Justice\nScalia, to the 1,223 cases that were\nunexplained.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this could be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, now, maybe I'm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just one point, if I\nmay, Justice Breyer -- those are the California Supreme\nCourt or California appellate court?\nMR. STRIS: That's the California Supreme\nCourt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.\nMR. STRIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, the difficulty of\nlooking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I\nmean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we\nwrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here.\nFirst, which was bothering me, had to do with our\nCourt's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be\nsimple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm\nnot sure about it. The other, which is much more\ninteresting, is what you're talking about.\nAll right, now, on the first one, I read the\nwords. It says the words \"on the merits.\" The Ninth\nCircuit thought those three words meant that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court could not have considered the\npetition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the\nmerits, just as with the cite. Now, whether these\nwords are right or wrong that follow, that's what we\nwrote. The next words were, \"There are many plausible\nanswers to this question.\" Sometimes, a court\naddresses the merits of a claim that it thought was\npresented in an untimely way. Why? Because they don't\npresent any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does,\nor because it wants to give the reviewing court\nalternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just\nwants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim\non the merits. He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer.\nHe gets a postcard. That helps him. So, there are a\nlot of reasons. And it says, \"Conclusion.\" Given the\nvariety of reasons why they might have put the words\n\"on the merits,\" the fact that they are there, those\nwords cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was\ntimely. So, then I read what they wrote. What they\nwrote is, \"When the California Court denies a habeas\npetition without comment or citation, we have long\ntreated the denial as a decision on the merits.\" Okay?\nAnd then it cites a pre-Carey case. \"Therefore, the\nsummary denial was on the merits, and the petition was\nnot dismissed as untimely,\" citing two pre-Carey cases.\nNow, I don't see how, since I just said the\nwords \"on the merits do not end the issue\" -- here, the\nwords weren't even there, but they say, \"We're treating\nit as if they were, and that ends the issue.\" So, what\ndo we do about that?\nThen the next question, once I figure that\none out, is, What do we do about the issue you're\nraising, which is quite important and interesting and\nso forth?\nMR. STRIS: Okay. Well, as to the first\nquestion, the explanation that you just provided\nclearly requires the Federal Courts, when there's some\nindication from the State Court that it might have been\nuntimely, to look into it. And that was the very\nproblem with what the Ninth Circuit did in that case.\nIt said \"on the merits and for lack of diligence.\" So,\nto presume that that was just on the merits, that's\nflatly wrong. You'd need to do some further\ninvestigation.\nIn light of the context of what's happening\nin California, however, when the State Court says\nnothing, there has to be some process by which the\nFederal Court can make a decision as to what that\nmeans, because if, in fact, in that case it was denied\non the merits and the State Court thought it was\ntimely, it would be extremely invasive for the Federal\nCourt to re-review the case, potentially come to a\ndifferent conclusion, and, we would suggest,\ndramatically alter the landscape of how prisoners\nexhaust their remedies in California, because now\nyou're developing a Federal body of law that may be\nvery different in deciding what's substantial and\nwhat's reasonable than California did. And so, what\nthe Ninth Circuit, I believe, did in this case was look\nto context and come up with the presumption that was\nmost reasonable in light of what's going on.\nSo, the first thing that is relevant, from a\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that the most\nreasonable presumption? Why isn't the most reasonable\npresumption that the California Court denies, for\nuntimeliness, wherever that issue is absolutely clear -\n-\nMR. STRIS: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and where that issue is\nnot absolutely clear, and the -- and the merits issue\nis absolutely clear, it just -- it just denies?\nMR. STRIS: The answer -- pardon me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't want to say\n\"denied on the merits,\" because that would suggest that\nit was timely.\nMR. STRIS: The answer, I would suggest,\nJustice Scalia, requires looking to California\npractice. And where I would start is with the\nCalifornia Supreme Court's decision in In re Sanders.\nAnd in In re Sanders, the Court made clear that after\nthe Supreme Court adopted their policies in 1989\nregarding certain presumptions in capital cases, and\nafter the seminal In re Clark case in 1993, which\nasserted -- rather, articulated California's timeliness\nstandards, most petitions -- and these are the\nCalifornia Supreme Court's words -- \"Most petitions are\ntimely filed.\" So, with that backdrop and the fact\nthat half of the California Supreme Court's cases are\nbeing denied with a case citation, it's reasonable to\nconclude that the unexplained denials are not\nnecessarily untimely.\nNow, I would add to that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what it --\n\"most\" is 51 percent. I mean, among those that you\ndon't know whether it was the merits or not, there\ncould be a lot of ones where the timeliness is simply\nnot decided upon.\nMR. STRIS: It's certainly the case, Justice\nScalia, that the presumptions the Ninth Circuit adopted\ncould permit cases that even the California State\nCourts would consider to be untimely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could work with\nthat. Now, that's, sort of, helpful, because if they\nsay \"most are timely filed,\" then the next question\nwould be, \"All right, what period of time is it?\"\nMR. STRIS: Well, that's the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You'd have to get some\nprofessor to go through these cases, and they could --\nthey could figure out how long it is. What do you\nthink it is, from your experience?\nMR. STRIS: I can't really answer that, and\nthat's at the heart of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, is it more like\na month, or is it more like 3 years?\nMR. STRIS: Well, the reason I would suggest\nthat -- and answering that is not necessarily\nappropriate or helpful in resolving the question -- is\nbecause of the series of cases that we quoted in\nfootnote 15 of our brief. In certain instances, the\nCalifornia Courts have found 3 and a half years, 1 and\na half years, 2 years to be reasonable. Now, that\ndoesn't mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. STRIS: In one instance, it was because\nof attorney abandonment. In other cases, it was\nbecause the prisoner was indigent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, there's a special\nreason. In your case, is there really a year that\nisn't explained at all?\nMR. STRIS: Oh, I think it would apply to our\ncase, as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. STRIS: In our case, the first 15 months\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, forget that. The\nlibrary, I'll give you. What's the rest?\nMR. STRIS: After that, our client was\neffectively on lockdown and had no access whatsoever to\nthe library. Now, this presents the burden problem\nwith doing any sort of independent determination. The\nAttorney General suggested, in the District Court, that\nthere was a paging system in place whereby prisoners\nwho are on lockdown could get access to the library.\nThere was never any suggestion in the District Court on\nthe part of the Attorney General that the lockdown\ndidn't exist. And the Attorney General, and not my\nclient, would have access to those records.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- well, did your -- did\nyour client file an affidavit or something saying he\ndidn't have access to the library during the whole\nperiod of 3 years?\nMR. STRIS: I wouldn't call it an affidavit,\nbut it was -- he filed an opposition to the motion to\ndismiss.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMR. STRIS: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is there anything in the\nrecord that says, during the year after they said,\n\"We'll change your job so you can get access to the\nlibrary,\" that he didn't have access to the library?\nMR. STRIS: Yes. I -- well, I -- he didn't\ntalk about not having access to the library. It's\nimplicit, if you look at the Joint Appendix at --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right, so what's\nhis reason for saying that, \"Last year, I was not able\nto file a petition in California Supreme Court\"?\nMR. STRIS: That he had had -- had access to\nnothing. In other words, he didn't say, \"I didn't have\naccess\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what does it say? What\ndoes he say? Go ahead.\nMR. STRIS: Well, it would be on the Joint\nAppendix, pages 38 and 39, where he describes the\nlockdown. And, you know, I haven't looked at it\nrecently, but my understanding is that he was\nsuggesting that he had had access to nothing, including\nthe prison library. And the Attorney General suggests\nthat there was a paging system, but the documentary\nevidence that the Attorney General puts into the\nrecord, which is on pages 68 -- 67 -- no, pardon me,\n88 through 96 -- is a prison manual that's dated 2000.\nNow, it says it's amended. But my client takes the\nposition that this wasn't in the place at his prison at\nthat time, and that would require a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. STRIS: -- evidentiary hearing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the burden --\nMR. STRIS: -- to determine --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for that one is on him.\nI mean, if you say the burden is on the State to come\nup with a -- you know, showing that there was such a\nsystem, they came up with it. And you say, \"The system\nmay have been amended.\" Well, if it has been amended,\nthere the burden is on you.\nMR. STRIS: Of course. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --\nMR. STRIS: -- the burden --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- well --\nMR. STRIS: Pardon me. The burden on him\nwould be in the context of an evidentiary hearing,\nwhich never took place. The District Court in this\ncase didn't reach that issue, because they found that\nstatutory tolling --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, the --\nMR. STRIS: -- wasn't available.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the next thing, what he\nactually says here, is that the C facility where he was\nconfined was put into lockdown clearly into February\n1997. And this is all after he got access. Then it\nremained quiet and lockdown free until August 11th,\n1997. So, that seems six months, on the most generous\ninterpretation --\nMR. STRIS: But that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where he's not in\nlockdown, and he has access to the library.\nMR. STRIS: But that illustrates the very --\nJUSTICE BREYER: About six months.\nMR. STRIS: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nAnd that illustrates the very problem with this case,\nwhich is that in cases where there is 90 days, 2\nmonths, 4 months, the very difficult questions that a\nFederal Court would normally look to State law, if it\nwas determinant, to apply, California is giving no\nguidance. And our case falls within that once you look\nto the particular explanations that our client put\nforward. And so, we would suggest that if there is a\nconcern on the part of the Court about certain cases\ngetting through and essentially allowing prisoners to\nabuse the writ, that this Court will use its equitable\ndiscretion to look at individual cases and to decide,\n\"Hey, is this a situation where the behavior is\ndilatory? Is this a situation where the behavior is\nabusive?\" And that would restrict the number of cases\nwhere Federal Courts would need to engage in a factual\ninquiry. The alternative is adopting a presumption,\nthat the Attorney General suggested, that the\nCalifornia Courts have flatly rejected. That\npresumption has been adopted -- has been imported from\nthe direct-appeal context. It has no significance in\nCalifornia habeas law. In the direct-appeal context,\nprisoners have the right to counsel. In the habeas\ncontext, they don't, except in capital cases. And,\nunsurprisingly -- pardon me -- unsurprisingly, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court has adopted a presumption of\n90 days, in the capital context. So, in the -- in the\nnoncapital cases, like my client's, where individuals\nhave no incentive to delay -- my client has been up for\nparole twice already, he has no incentive to delay the\nhabeas process -- and where people like Mr. Chavis\nthink that they're, in good faith, complying -- and\nit's not just an issue of excuse -- and this goes back\nto a -- to a question that Justice O'Connor asked\nearlier -- there are specific policy reasons why the\nState of California has adopted the standard that it\nhas. They've articulated --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt? I\nwant to be sure that I get one thing straight. The 90-\nday presumption in capital cases, that is that if it's\nwithin 90 days, it's reasonable. Does it also presume\nthat it's a -- more than 90 days, it's unreasonable?\nMR. STRIS: It presumes that if it's within\n90 days, it's timely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. STRIS: And then you engage in the\ninquiry. But that's significant, Justice Stevens,\nbecause these individuals are represented by counsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. But do\nthey adopt the converse? If it's more than 90 days, is\nit presumed to be untimely?\nMR. STRIS: No, they do not. And they've\nflatly rejected that and found cases where there's --\nseveral years' delay, even in the capital context, to\nbe reasonable. But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I could see how they\ncould overcome a presumption that way, but there's not\neven a presumption that over 90 days is unreasonable.\nMR. STRIS: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There isn't. You --\nMR. STRIS: There is not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean if you go in and\nyou say, \"I'm\" -- you know, it's more than 90 days, and\nyou bring in no evidence whatever of any excuse for\nbeing over 90 days, you're telling me that California\nSupreme Court would accept it?\nMR. STRIS: No, that's not true. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then --\nMR. STRIS: -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- then it is a presumption\n--\nMR. STRIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that if it's over 90\ndays, unless you have a reason, it's untimely.\nMR. STRIS: The burden shifts the prisoner to\nproduce some evidence. I didn't understand that to be\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, here we have 180 days --\n180 days, twice 90 -- with no excuse at all presented.\nMR. STRIS: In the noncapital context. And\nit's very -- it's very different, because the\nCalifornia State Courts are articulating particularly -\n- particular policy reasons for noncapital prisoners to\ndelay. One that they're articulated is a desire to\navoid the piecemeal presentation of claims. And this\nis particular to California's original writ system.\nYou can have a functional appeal, but, because it's\nalso an original writ, you -- if you have an additional\nclaim that's legitimate, you need to add it in that\nclaim.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But once it's --\nMR. STRIS: And --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in the Federal habeas\ncontext, the AEDPA law suggests there's a great premium\npaid -- at stake for promptly resolving these things.\nWhat do we do about that? This is in the Federal court\nsystem now.\nMR. STRIS: If it were the case -- and\nthere's no evidence on the record to suggest this --\nthat a substantial number of cases were going to start\ncoming through California with massive delays, and this\nCourt was going to be forced to provide statutory\ntolling, that would be a problem. But there's no\nevidence to suggest that. And that ties back to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what would we do in\nthat situation?\nMR. STRIS: If that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If it's --\nMR. STRIS: -- started happening?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- open to the Federal\nCourts.\nMR. STRIS: If that started happening, I\nthink you, in this Court, would do nothing. I think\nthat Congress would see what was going on, and they'd\namend the statute, because that's clearly not what they\nintended. But that's not this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Amend just for California,\nwhen the system is working fine, all the other States\nthat do have the timelines?\nMR. STRIS: I don't think they would do that,\nJustice Ginsburg. But there's a proposal that I'm\naware of, already, to change the specific language of\n2244(d)(2), and it was made by a congressman in\nCalifornia. It doesn't suggest changing it for\nCalifornia; it suggests changing the language. But\nthat hasn't happened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To do what? What would it\nsay?\nMR. STRIS: I believe it replaces the word\n\"pending\" with some replacement. And so, it\nessentially changes the tolling provision to account\nfor this problem. But that hasn't happened yet. Right\nnow, we have a congressional statute that, on its face,\ndoes not require the Federal Courts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about this? You might\nlose under this, but it -- see, so you say -- look, in\nevery other State, the time for appealing from an\nappeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them,\nis 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30. So, if the\nNinth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than\n30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say \"on the\nmerits,\" whether they cite a case, whether they don't\nsay anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth\nCircuit should assume that they've done is consider it\nuntimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the\nCalifornia Courts might accept as an excuse. So, then\nthey'll look into that. And if California, in the\nfuture, wants something different -- which I'd be\nsurprised -- they will say that their system means that\na 3-year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely.\nBut, in the absence of some reason to think that, why\nnot use the words, which would give you a chance to go\nback, and you could say, \"This is not a case of total\nlack of excuse. There is excuse of the kind that\nCalifornia would accept.\"\nMR. STRIS: Well, I think the problem with\nthat sort of rule, Justice Breyer, is that it risks\nerror, because California's standard is so\nindeterminate, and at very little -- it gets very\nlittle benefit. Because there's -- there is no real\nharm -- there's no real harm to the Federal interest\nhere just because we have a conclusive presumption.\nThe very nature of a conclusive presumption is that\nsometimes there will be cases that don't fit the\npresumption. But, on this record, and on anything I've\nseen from my review of California procedure, there's\nnothing to suggest that a -- the Federal interest in\navoiding substantial delays is compromised by the\nspecific rule that the Ninth Circuit has adopted. And\nthe Ninth Circuit has adopted a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can you --\nhow can you say that? We do have a Federal rule and a\nlimitation, and (d)(2) is an exception for time that\nit's pending before the State Courts. And if the State\nCourts aren't going to bother to tell us whether\nsomething's timely or not, or pending, giving them a\nblank check does undermine the Federal interest behind\nthe 1-year limitation period.\nMR. STRIS: I would say two things about\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. The first thing is, I would\nstrongly resist your characterization that the State\nCourt is saying nothing. I think that, in most cases,\nthey are saying something, and that, in the cases that\ninvolve postcard denials, many of them, the court is\nsaying that they're timely, and, in others, those are\nthe hard questions. So, I would restrict your\ncharacterization to the fact that California is not\nsaying something in some cases.\nNow, because the Federal statute necessarily\nimports a State standard, that's the very problem with\nthe statute. I can conceive of many instances where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you think the\nFederal statute necessarily imports a State standard?\nIt says that the State postconviction proceeding must\nbe pending. And California presents an unusual\nsituation, but we interpret that pending is a question\nof Federal law. It's not a State standard.\nMR. STRIS: That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.\nBut if you took that to its logical conclusion, then,\nwhen State Courts made errors -- they didn't see that a\ncase was properly filed, they just missed it -- the\nFederal Court would go in and review. Or in a case\nwhere they did claim the reverse, the Federal Court\ncould say, \"No, there was clear error.\" But this Court\nhas rejected that in Saffold. It's rejected it in\nPace. And -- because that is informed by the very view\nthat the tolling provision was included to encourage\none round of State exhaustion free of Federal\ninterference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But we decided --\nI'd like you to suggest something to -- from putting\nyourself in the -- in an imaginary position. Carey\nversus Saffold did have a dissent. And four Justices\njoined it. And let's imagine that, when I read the\ndissent, I see the -- and then I look at this case -- I\nsee imaginary words on the top of the dissent, which\nare, \"We told you so.\"\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- now, therefore, think\nnot of if you were arguing Carey v. Saffold afresh, but\nthink of the words that are actually written there.\nAnd now think of what happened here. And now propose\nsomething, please, that will, in fact, deal with the\nproblem that this case seems to present.\nMR. STRIS: Well, I would be lying, Justice\nBreyer, if I didn't say that I haven't thought about\nthat. And the problem is that the rule announced in\nSaffold isn't the right rule. It's trying to deal with\na problem that's been created by the California State\nCourts. And so, the solution that the Ninth Circuit\nhas adopted -- that's our proposal. We essentially\nthink that it has a minimal harm to Federal interests,\nbecause maybe certain cases will get in that Congress\ndidn't intend, but if you don't adopt it, there's no\nalternative. You can't certify the question. In\nCalifornia, you can't certify to the Court of Appeal.\nYou can't certify from a District Court. So, if the\nCalifornia State Courts aren't going to change, it's\nnot incumbent upon this Court to read the statute\ndifferently than the proper interpretation. And I\nconcede the arguments that were made in the dissenting\nopinion in Saffold are very interesting, and they don't\ncompel, in my opinion, a different interpretation of\nthe statute; they recognize the difficulty that the\nstatute presents. And it presents that difficulty\nbecause it does incorporate, in some measure, a State\nstandard, and because there's one State out there,\nCalifornia, that's doing something that's very\ndifficult to deal with.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this -- two\nquestions about California? Is the problem we're\ndiscussing, with these long delays, primarily in the\napplication the third range, the application of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, as opposed to lower courts?\nMR. STRIS: Well, I wouldn't characterize it\nas a problem, because, like I said before, I don't\nthink that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is the condition, that\nthere is the long delay, that primarily occurs in the -\n- in the application of State Supreme Court? Is it --\nMR. STRIS: I have no -- I've seen no\nspecific evidence to be able to answer that with any\ncitation, but my understanding, Justice Stevens, is\nthat that makes sense, because it's the last process\nthat the prisoner is going to be able to engage in,\nthen they'll have to go to the Federal Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then my second question is,\nHave we decided, or is it a matter of common practice\nin California, that the application to the California\nSupreme Court is necessary in order to complete the\nexhaustion?\nMR. STRIS: It is -- it is necessary, in my\nopinion. I don't know if the State -- if this Court\nhas ever --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We've held it --\nMR. STRIS: -- decided that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in cases where there's\ndirect review, but this is a different sort of animal\nthat you have in California.\nMR. STRIS: But once you start from the\npremise that these are functional appeals, which they\nare, I don't see how you could read AEDPA any other\nway. I mean, AEDPA says that if there's an available\nmethod to challenge and -- a petition, whether it be by\nreview or original writ, to the California Supreme\nCourt would be available. So, you could be sure that\nif prisoners --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think it is --\nMR. STRIS: -- didn't file --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- required.\nMR. STRIS: Yes. If they didn't file, they'd\nget kicked out of Federal Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's one aspect of\nSaffold that you haven't addressed. We not only said\nwhat we said about they're saying \"on the merits,\" we\nactually cited a case that involved exactly the\nsituation here -- namely, Welch versus Newland, a CA9\ncase from 2001. And we cited that as an example of how\nthe Ninth Circuit rule, quote, \"risks the tolling of\nthe Federal limitations period even when it is highly\nlikely that the prisoner failed to seek timely review\nin the State appellate courts,\" close quote.\nMR. STRIS: I would say two things about\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How could the Ninth Circuit\nhere simply have ignored that criticism of exactly what\nthey did here?\nMR. STRIS: Well, I don't believe they\nignored it, Justice Scalia. And if you look at the\nWelch case that you're referring to, on en banc\nrehearing the en banc panel reached a very different\nresult. They didn't reach the issue of timeliness, for\nthe reasons I described, but they determined that that\nwas not a functional appeal, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we --\nMR. STRIS: -- the claim --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we didn't cite the en\nbanc decision. We cited the panel decision --\nMR. STRIS: The en banc --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- didn't we?\nMR. STRIS: -- decision occurred after your -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: After.\nMR. STRIS: -- case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the point is, we\ncriticized the panel decision in Welch, which did\nexactly what this panel did here.\nMR. STRIS: I don't agree with that\ncharacterization, Justice Scalia. I believe that case\nwas included to illustrate that this Court thought that\nwas probably too long, and that not looking at all to\nwhat's happening in the California system risks that.\nI don't think anything was at least necessary to the\nholding in Saffold --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We cited --\nMR. STRIS: -- because it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it for the proposition\nthat it -- as an example of how the Ninth Circuit rule,\nquote, \"risks the tolling of the Federal limitations\nperiod even when it is highly likely that the prisoner\nfailed to seek timely review in the State appellate\ncourts.\" That's what we cited.\nMR. STRIS: That is true. And in the context\nof a case like Saffold, where there's a reference to\nlack of diligence, that risk is too great. I'm not\ngoing to get up here and suggest that there's no risk\nto a conclusive presumption that some cases are going\nto make it into Federal Court that Congress didn't\nintend. But it's a balancing that's inherent in the\nnotion of federalism. There is a risk that, by not\nreviewing clear statements by the California State\nCourt, that cases get in that shouldn't. A case could\nnot have been properly filed, and the State Court\ndidn't find it. But, in Saffold and in Pace, this\nCourt announced the principle that once the State Court\ndecides, that's the end of the matter.\nAnd I guess, in summation, what I suggest is\nthat atmospherically this case presents a difficult\nproblem. The Ninth Circuit is involved. There is a\nfive-four decision in Saffold. We recognize those\nthings. However, there is no easy solution. The Ninth\nCircuit has adopted a rule that balances the very\ninterest in federalism that the tolling provision was\nintended to preserve, and there's no suggestion that\nsome corresponding Federal interest is compromised.\nAnd, in fact, if the Federal Courts are required to\nreview these cases, they'll be required to do it in 60\ndays, in 70 days, in 80 days, and, if they make a\nmistake, and they find a case to be untimely that the\nCalifornia Court didn't, will deprive first Federal\nhabeas, one Congress didn't intend. That's\nfundamentally contrary to the purpose of AEDPA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\nMR. STRIS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Mr. Stris.\nMs. Chatman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE BAKER CHATMAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMS. CHATMAN: Thank you.\nOf course there's a Federal interest at stake\nhere. It's the Federal interest in the Federal Courts\nnot having to deal with stale habeas claims in Federal\nCourt.\nOne thing I'd like to address is the capital-\ncase presumption, which is now -- excuse me -- 180\ndays. It's been changed from 90 days. That\npresumption is for -- from the filing of the reply\nbrief to filing an initial petition in California\nCourt. That is, your first habeas petition. That --\nyou only get presumed timely for 180 days. Here, we're\ntalking about noncapital cases going just from --\ntaking claims, that have already been presented in one\npetition, to the next level. So, in those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, 180 days from what?\nMS. CHATMAN: From the filing of the -- the\nfinal due date of the filing of the reply brief --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, you file --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- in the direct appeal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the reply brief in the\nlower court. Maybe the judge will take 4 months to\ndecide it. What's the relation? I don't understand\nthat. Or maybe it'll take --\nMS. CHATMAN: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- 2 days --\nMS. CHATMAN: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to decide.\nMS. CHATMAN: I think they -- I think they\ndate it from the filing of the reply brief because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? What would the theory\nbe? I don't understand that.\nMS. CHATMAN: Because they like to see these\nclaims presented along with the appeal to be -- so that\nthey can possibly bring them together and decide habeas\nclaims in light of the record on appeal. So, I think\nthat's why they date it from filing of the reply\nbriefs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, a judge -- you file it.\nOn day -- what -- you file it on April 1st, and then\nthe judge decides it in August. Or September. And now\nit's only 3 days before the 6-months -- you have to\nfile your appeal, like, in 3 days. That wouldn't make\nsense. And the converse would not --\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, you're not -- you're\ngenerally not supposed to be waiting. I mean, you were\ntalking about claims such as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- ineffective --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- file an --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- assistance --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- appeal before -- oh,\nmaybe you can in California. You're going to file the\nappeal before the lower court decides it?\nMS. CHATMAN: Well, if we're talking about\ncapital cases here, they are -- they are filing their\nappeals directly in the California Supreme Court;\nsimilarly, with their habeas petitions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even -- or even before they\nget a lower court decision.\nMS. CHATMAN: There would be no lower court\ndecision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They don't, at all.\nMS. CHATMAN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other --\nMS. CHATMAN: No, no, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they don't, at all.\nMS. CHATMAN: No, they go --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh.\nMS. CHATMAN: -- straight to California\nSupreme Court. Which brings up one point, which is\nthat the problem that we're looking at here in deciding\ntimeliness will not arise in capital cases. We will\nnot have that problem, because capital cases go\nstraight to the California Supreme Court. There are\nnot going to be intervals between the courts to deal\nwith. So, that simplifies, I think, the problem a\nlittle bit.\nThe other thing I'd like to address is the\nargument that a State Court is saying something with\nthese summary orders. I strongly disagree with that.\nThey are absolutely saying nothing. This Court said in\nYlst that the essence of an unexplained order is that\nit says nothing. It does not say, \"This is a timely\npetition.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the ones that\nwould cite a case that threw out the petition because\nit was untimely -- and we were told there were over a\nthousand of those every year -- that would be saying\nsomething, wouldn't it?\nMS. CHATMAN: That is -- in the California\nSupreme Court, you will find that sometimes, that they\nwill indicate untimeliness by a case citation; hardly\never in the lower appellate court.\nAnd I would also disagree with the\ncharacterization of delay being a problem going from\nthe lower appellate court to the California Supreme\nCourt. We see it at both levels.\nAnd I would also disagree that this shouldn't\nbe a problem because these Petitioners have no\nincentive to delay. That may be the case, that they\ndon't have an incentive to delay, but they do, in fact,\nsleep on their rights, as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How often --\nMS. CHATMAN: -- Mr. Chavis did.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you, as the Attorney\nGeneral, what period of time after the District Courts\nmade a decision, and now -- they've now filed their\nclaim in the Court of Appeals -- how long is it before\nyou say it's untimely?\nMS. CHATMAN: We would -- we would say\nanything over 60 days. Yes, Your Honor.\nI see my time is up. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nChatman.\n"
