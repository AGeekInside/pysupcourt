        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 08-240, Mac's Shell\nService v. Shell Oil Products, and the consolidated case.\nMr. Lamken.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS\nCOMPANY, LLC, ET AL.\nMR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nCongress enacted the PMPA to regulate two\nspecific, but important, actions: Franchisors'\ntermination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of\nthe franchise term and the franchisors' non-renewal of\nthe franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's\nterm.\nThe statute responded to complaints about\nfranchisors exercising broad contractual rights to\nterminate the franchise relationship that was not\naddressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that\nwas not previously addressed by State law. But Congress\nleft all other aspects of the franchise relationship to\nState law.\nBecause the term \"terminate,\" at the very\nleast, requires an end, we and the United States agree\nthat the First Circuit erred in upholding a so-called\nconstructive termination, where the dealers continued to\nreceive each element of the statutory franchise -- that\nis the premises, the trademark, and fuel --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that\nyou don't really object to the recognition of\n\"constructive termination,\" if that phrase is used the\nway it is used elsewhere in contract law?\nMR. LAMKEN: We don't believe that in contract\nlaw constructive termination exists or in the analogous\nState franchise statutes that existed at the time that\nthe Congress enacted the PMPA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I thought -- I thought\nthat if you had a lease and the landlord fails to\nprovide heat, that you can move out and he will be\ndeemed to have constructively evicted you.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's right. The term\n\"constructive eviction\" we would -- we believe does\nexist, along with \"constructive discharge.\" But the\nprecise terms that Congress used here were \"terminate,\"\n\"non-renew,\" and \"cancel,\" which are drawn from the law\nof contracts and the U.C.C., in particular, and from\nState franchise statutes. We --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- on that point,\nthe government differs with you. The government says,\nas Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing\nas constructive termination, and you must terminate.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. It's not so much that we\ndiffer; it's that our fallback position is the same as\nthe government's, but they do not endorse our primary\nposition, which is that there is no such thing as\nconstructive termination.\nWe believe it would be a mistake to recognize\nconstructive termination in this context for three\nreasons: The first is the one I already mentioned, is\nthat, in the most analogous context that existed at the\ntime Congress acted, State franchise statutes that used\nterms like \"terminate,\" \"non-renew,\" \"cancel,\" the terms\nthat Congress used, there was -- the notion of\nconstructive termination was frankly unheard of.\nEven today, under those statutes it is not a\nwell-accepted concept, having been rejected by\napproximately half the States to have considered it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but all -- under\none view, all the dealer is doing is mitigating damages.\nIn other words, the deal is off. He's in effect been\nterminated. You're saying, well then, he has to pack up\nand leave. He can stay and still reduce the damages you\nare going to have to pay.\nMR. LAMKEN: On the contrary, Your Honor.\nIt's not so much -- there isn't a mitigation of damages,\nany more than an employee claiming constructive\ndischarge, for example, would be mitigating damages by\nstaying in her job. The settled rule, even when\nconstructive claims are recognized, is that an employee\nclaiming --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- constructive discharge must\nmove out, must quit the job, and the tenant claiming\nconstructive eviction must leave the job. That is the\nnature, even where constructive discharge and\nconstructive termination -- constructive eviction\nclaims, are recognized. That is the settled rule.\nIf you have something else, for example,\nthere's a breach of contract, you can claim your breach\nof contract, and you can sue for damages while\ncontinuing to operate. But if you're going to claim\nthat it wasn't a mere breach of contract, but in fact it\nwas a constructive termination, that you've lost all the\nrights to continue to operate -- you may not get fuel,\nyou may not get --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've lost the\nrights to operate at a particular level. In other\nwords, if they say -- I don't know how the deal works,\nbut, you know, you've got to charge $10 a gallon or, you\nknow, you've got to close the convenient mart or\nwhatever, you have lost the right to operate at that.\nThe terms of the lease under which you were operating\nhave been effectively terminated. That doesn't mean you\ncan't still make money, and it doesn't mean you have to\ngive that up, but --\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but the deal has\nbeen terminated.\nMR. LAMKEN: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you\nhave confused breach with termination. The failure to\ngive the rights on the terms provided in the lease or\nthe agreement would be a breach of contract. But\ntermination in contract law has long been understood to\nbe something entirely different, which is the absolute\nrefusal to provide the elements such that it's obvious\nto any observer that there is -- these elements will not\nbe resumed.\nCorbin on Contracts, for example, describes\ntermination as occurring \"when either party, pursuant to\na power created by agreement or law, puts an end to the\ncontract,\" \"extinguishing future obligations of both\nparties to the agreement.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did Williston say\nabout it? Contract --\nMR. LAMKEN: Pardon.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does Williston\nsay about it?\nMR. LAMKEN: Williston didn't actually address\nthat. Corbin addresses it because he talks about the\nU.C.C., and the U.C.C. in turn says: \"On termination,\nall obligations\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is leaving the\npremises the sine quo non of a termination?\nMR. LAMKEN: It's the sine qua non of any\ntermination under this statute, we would believe, if you\nrecognize constructive termination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But aren't there -- aren't\nthere some operators that own their own premises?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's right. That's why it\nwould have to be a determination of one of the three\nfranchise elements. The way the statute's written, each\nof the different --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So only one of the three\nwould suffice in your view?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's right. Each of these\nseparate elements is treated as a franchise, and you can\nhave the termination of any one of the three, and that\nis a termination of the franchise --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just --\nMR. LAMKEN: -- defined within the agreement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just testing your view,\nsuppose there are two franchisees, and in each case the\noil company reduces the amount they're paying for the\ngas. One franchisee can't afford it, leaves, quits --\ntermination. The other franchisee has a considerable\namount of savings, and he protests, but he stays in\nbusiness. Different result?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, in our view the result\nwould be the same in both. Neither of those would be a\ntermination, because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. In my first, he\nceases to operate and he moves out of the premises.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. In our view it has to be\nthe franchisor that terminates, not the franchisee. But\nif one accepts the construct of the constructive\ntermination, those would be different results, because,\nat the very least, termination requires an end to one of\nthe franchise elements. And the individual who sues,\nhaving not -- having -- still receiving all the\nfranchise elements, hasn't been terminated in any sense\nof the word.\nBut the key thing is he actually has a breach\nof contract action. Raising the price unreasonably on\nan open price term has long, uniformly, comprehensively\nbeen addressed by State law, like U.C.C. 2-305.\nSo the answer always is you can sue for\nbreach of contract. And Congress wasn't worried about\nthe fact there might be breaches of contract that\nordinary contract remedies don't sufficiently remedy.\nCongress's concern was the exercise of contractually\nbroad rights to terminate and non-renew the\nrelationship. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the government comes up\nhere, as I think they will in a few minutes, and tells\nus that there is such a thing as constructive\ntermination, do you know what hypothetical they give us\nto illustrate how that would work? I mean, it's their\nargument, but I'm curious. I will be curious to know\nhow you would respond to that.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, there is a\nsmall universe of cases in which there is a constructive\ntermination without leaving the premises, without\nsevering the fuel, et cetera.\nMR. LAMKEN: I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't know what\nthey're going to -- how you would respond to that?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. I think the government\ndoesn't think that constructive termination extends to\ncases where you continue to receive all three franchise\nelements. They would believe that constructive\ntermination requires at least one of those three\nelements to end, just as it does --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your position is that the\nfranchisor has to be the one to terminate?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's our position, yes. The\nfranchisor has to be the one that exercises the\ntermination. The notion of constructive termination,\nwhere the franchisee effectively abandons the premises\nin response to conditions it thought intolerable, that\nthat is a constructive termination, and it was not a\nconcept that existed under the most analogous statutes\nunder the contract law from which the terms\n\"termination,\" \"non-renewal\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that the franchisor can\ndo outrageous things -- triple the rent, double the\nprice of the fuel -- and you would say, even so, there's\n-- that doesn't count as a termination because the\nfranchisor hasn't terminated?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's right, and precisely\nbecause all those things were comprehensively and\nuniformly addressed by contract law, uniform contract\nlaw. The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you'd just have a\nmagic words test.\nMR. LAMKEN: No, it does not reduce -- I mean,\nbecause we -- we agree that there can be a termination\nby deed as well as by words. For example, the outright\nrefusal to provide the fuel, provide fuel at all, would\nbe a termination. You don't have to say we are hereby\nrescinding all of your rights under the contract. At\nsome point, it becomes obvious, clear to any observer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what happens after\nthat? Don't you take the position that the station\nowner then has to refuse all other elements of the\ncontract, right?\nMR. LAMKEN: If -- no, our position would be\nthat where the station owner abandons in response, that\nwould not be an actual termination. The government\nwould take the view that that's a constructive\ntermination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait, wait --\nMR. LAMKEN: And the problem this gets you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said there is a\ntermination by the company if it fails to provide one of\nthe three basic elements, right?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes, that is correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is a termination?\nMR. LAMKEN: That is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What response has to be made\nby the station owner? Anything?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He can continue to take the\nother two elements?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, it's particularly -- I\nmean, since the franchise is described as having three\nelements --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no?\nMR. LAMKEN: He can continue taking the other\ntwo elements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there has still been a\ntermination?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, there has been a\ntermination of the franchise, which is defined as having\nthree -- effectively three separate franchise\nagreements. Each of the different elements is treated\nlike it's a different contract or a different agreement.\nSo if you terminate one, there has been a termination of\nthe franchise, because the franchise is defined to\nencompass all three elements. You've got to get --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the government's\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\nThis is all one contract, isn't it? You are saying --\nMR. LAMKEN: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying you can\nterminate a third of the contract?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. Oftentimes these are in\nseparate contracts, and in this case there are actually\ntwo contracts as opposed to three. And, yes, the way\nthe statute's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they are not contingent\non each other, so that at any time the company could\nterminate one of them and stick the station owner with\nthe other two?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, one could imagine a\nsituation where the trademark is withdrawn, but you can\ncontinue to be a lessee of the premises and market the\nfuel as an unbranded --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not continues to be. You\nmust continue to be.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. But the contract could be\nwritten that way, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That sounds like a very\nstrange way to write the contract.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, the way Congress wrote the\nstatute was to define the franchise --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about writing\nthe statute. I'm talking about writing the contract.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really think that\nthat's how those contracts should be interpreted?\nMR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, sometimes they are,\nfor very good reasons, written as independent contracts\nand sometimes they will be dependent contracts,\ndepending on the nature of the relationship between the\nparties.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is -- what is the\ndifference between your understanding of an implicit\ntermination, which is what I take it you have just been\ndescribing, and a constructive termination?\nMR. LAMKEN: I think an implicit termination\nis one that's objectively viewed as ending the nature of\nthe relationship of the parties. The contract's over.\nYou no longer have the right. Fuel will not be coming.\nYou may not use our trademark, or you may no longer use\nour premises.\nA constructive termination, as I understand\nthe concept, could be something -- and this is the\ndifficulty with the concept -- something like charging\ntoo much, an excessive price, which is a breach of\ncontract, which would prevent a reasonable franchisee\nfrom continuing to accept that element.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the franchisor\ncompletely refuses to supply gas, that's an implicit\ntermination?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's as good as --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if he charges $1,000 a\ngallon, that's not a termination?\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. That's correct. And the\ndifficulty is -- that would be a breach of contract\nremediable under State law. And the difficulty is, the\nmoment you move this into the issue of price, suddenly\nthe issue of price -- how much the franchisor can charge\nis a question of Federal law, in a statute that just\ntalks about termination and non-renewal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you put\nforth this dichotomy between breach of contract and\nconstructive termination. I don't know why something\ncan't be both.\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, in fact, in order to be\nconstructive termination, something would have to be a\nbreach of contract. I think the government would\nconcede that. It has to be wrongful. For example,\ninsisting on your ordinary contractual rights cannot be\na constructive termination. It must also be a breach of\ncontract, which is precisely why it doesn't add very\nmuch to -- it's unlikely that Congress intended to\nincorporate it, because those things that already\nbreached the contract were already addressed by State\nlaw. There was no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And could you, Mr. Lamken,\nstraighten out what happened in the district court?\nBecause I take it there was an award for breach of\ncontract as well as one for termination and they were in\nan identical amount. So what happened to the breach of\ncontract?\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The award?\nMR. LAMKEN: The actual damages here -- the\namounts were overlapping. And so everything that they\nwill recover, the amounts of compensation recovered for\ntermination, are covered by the breach of contract\nclaim. The difference between the two is about\n$1.4 million worth of attorney's fees and expert costs\nthat are covered by the PMPA, but would not be provided\nunder contract law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a rather significant\ndifference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does the company have to\ndo in your view to effect a genuine termination and not\na constructive termination?\nMR. LAMKEN: It may do -- one, issue the\nnotice that's required, say that they are terminating,\nthat this is -- in the words of contract, we are\nextinguishing the future operations; or they can engage\nin conduct which an objectively reasonable observer\nwould have to understand gives that exact same message.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that constructive\ntermination?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the conduct is you\nstopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me.\nMR. LAMKEN: It's an actual termination. And\nthe problem is, once you get into -- you get into\nconstructive termination, you get the question of:\nWell, is it a constructive termination to raise the\nprice by 1 percent or, as the case entirely involves\nmarket --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand what\nyour number two consists of unless it consists of an act\nthat the other side would call constructive -- or the\ngovernment would call constructive termination.\nMR. LAMKEN: I think sometimes there is an\nunclear line between what some people call an implicit\nor informal actual termination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LAMKEN: -- and what other people would\ncall a constructive termination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think there's always an\nunclear line between those two.\nMR. LAMKEN: But I don't think -- in the\nhighly unusual case of $1,000 per gallon or things like\nthat, that might be the case. But in the ordinary cases\nyou see a 1 percent increase in gas prices in highly\nvolatile petroleum markets. For example, in this case,\nwhere Shell raised its prices considerably but was still\ncharging less than Exxon and Chevron, as the joint\nappendix 225 and 237 made clear, that's what you end up\nwith as claims for constructive termination, if you\nrecognize constructive termination.\nBut Congress was worried about actual\nterminations, the exercise of contractual rights, broad\ncontractual rights, to terminate that were formerly not\nregulated, not breaches of contract that were already\nregulated by -- comprehensively, by State law.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. O'Neil.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING SHELL OIL PRODUCTS COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.\nMR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe government agrees with Shell that, because\nthere was no termination or non-renewal in any\nmeaningful sense of the word, the dealers failed to\nstate a claim under the PMPA. But, Justice Ginsburg,\nyou are correct: The government parts company with\nShell about what the term -- word \"termination,\" does\ncover. Shell would limit the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When would you -- when\nwould you measure your constructive termination? At\nwhat point would the statute of limitations begin to run\nor stop under your definition?\nMR. O'NEIL: When the franchisee is actually\nforced to end one of the statutory elements of the\nfranchise in response to the franchisor's conduct. And\nthat's the same test that would be applied in the\nconstructive discharge or constructive eviction context.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you would say\nthat the franchisee in this situation would have had to\nsay: I can't pay the increased amount of rent without\nthe subsidy; I'm going to stop.\nMR. O'NEIL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to leave the\npremises.\nMR. O'NEIL: That's correct. And that is the\nsame rule that -- that would apply to any other --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what about the\nstatutory right for a preliminary injunction? When\nwould that right kick in, in this situation?\nMR. O'NEIL: It --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because the preliminary\ninjunction stops the change of a contract price -- of a\ncontract term, obviously, or it continues it. So when\n-- at what point would --\nMR. O'NEIL: If a franchisee is faced with\nfranchisor conduct that will leave the franchisee with\nno alternative but to abandon a statutory element, then\nthe franchisee in that situation can go in and say that\nhe is in the equivalent position to someone who has\nreceived a piece of paper saying: You are hereby\nterminated. And we would say that for purposes of\nseeking preliminary injunctive relief, that the\nfranchisee can claim that he has been terminated for\nthose purposes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And for -- if for whatever\nreason the judge says no at the preliminary injunction\nstage, that's the end of it; the franchisee just has to\nleave the premises?\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, a judge would only deny a\npreliminary injunction if either there were no serious\nquestion going to the merits on the termination question\nor if the balance of hardships did not tip in the\nfranchisee's favor. And then the franchisee would be in\na very difficult position to claim that it was in some\nkind of catch-22, because by definition the judge would\nhave found that the franchisor is in a worse condition\nby having to continue the relationship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the franchisor stops\ndelivering gas. There are three -- three different\nobligations under the contract. What does the\nfranchisee have to do to show that he has accepted it as\na termination? Why does he have to leave the premises?\nThat's another contract, is -- is what the --\nMR. O'NEIL: Justice Scalia, we -- we agree\nwith Shell on this. The statute defines \"franchise\" by\nthree elements: The supply of fuel, the use of the\nleased premises, and the use of the trademark. So\nsomeone who is still on a gas station premises that had\nthe Shell sign above them but that had no fuel would not\nbe operating a gas station franchise, and that would be\na termination even if the franchisee did not actually\npick up and leave the premises. So we would call that a\ntermination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the conduct on the part of\nthe franchisor is raising the price of gas, how does the\nfactfinder determine whether it's sufficient to justify\na constructive termination? And assume that the\nfranchisee leaves -- the price of gas is raised, and\nthis particular franchisee says: I can't operate if gas\nis sold to me at that price. What's the standard for\ndetermining whether there was a constructive\ntermination?\nMR. O'NEIL: The test is, first of all,\nwhether the franchisor's conduct was wrongful -- in\nother words, in violation of the agreement between the\nparties; and whether a reasonable franchisee in those\ncircumstances would have no alternative but to do what\nthat franchisee did and to abandon the premises.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what's a reasonable\nfranchisee in that situation? Presumably some have a\nsmall profit margin; some have a bigger profit margin.\nSome could operate if the price of gas is raised; some\ncould not. How is that to be determined?\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, it's the same kind of\nquestion that juries ask all the time -- juries answer\nall the time in constructive discharge and constructive\neviction cases.\nIndeed, we think it may be easier to answer\nthat question in this context, because constructive\ndischarge and constructive eviction will often turn on\nintangible psychological factors like the level of\nindignity that an employee would suffer before leaving\nhis job. Gas station franchises are operated for -- to\nmake money, and if it would be impossible for a\nfranchisee to do that, then a reasonable franchisee in\nthose circumstances would have no choice but to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You are putting a jury in sort\nof the situation of a -- of a rate regulator, aren't\nyou, if you do that?\nMR. O'NEIL: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was it a reasonable rate?\nMR. O'NEIL: No. The question is whether it\nwould be so intolerable -- not whether the rate is fair,\nbut whether it would be so intolerable that a reasonable\nfranchisee, a rational franchisee who is economically\nmotivated, would have any alternative but to abandon it.\nAnd if the franchisee could continue in business, then\nit is not a constructive termination. The franchisee\nmight have a claim for breach of contract, but as long\nas -- as long as it would not be a fitting response to\nactually abandon the premises, then that is not a\nconstructive termination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Up -- up to that point, which\nsupposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a\nreasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he\nhas a contract claim, right? And then at that magical\npoint, the contract claim is converted into a claim\nunder the statute?\nMR. O'NEIL: When --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't the contract claim\nalone enough?\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, Justice Scalia, the whole\npoint of the PMPA was that State law remedies were\ninadequate in that narrow context where the franchisee's\nvery existence was threatened.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"In the context of\ntermination\" is what the statute says.\nMR. O'NEIL: Yes, and under well-established\nbackground principles of the law that Congress was\ndrawing on when it enacted the PMPA, termination was not\nlimited solely to explicit termination.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what are these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What background principles\nwere they? I don't know about constructive termination.\nThere was constructive discharge and constructive\neviction. But --\nMR. O'NEIL: The relationship here is in\nessence one of landlord and tenant. And so it was\nnatural for Congress to draw on that body of law, as\nwell as the body of law governing the termination of\nother kinds of relationships like employment, for the\nmeaning of the -- of \"termination\" under the PMPA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. O'Neil, I thought that\nthere were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the\ntenant is not required to leave the premises because, as\nawful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to\ngo.\nMR. O'NEIL: Justice Ginsburg, I am not aware\nof those cases, and I think the general rule is the one\nthat -- that is -- is broadly stated in the cases, which\nis that if the franchisee -- excuse me, if the tenant\nwants to claim constructive eviction, they need to leave\nthe premises. That is a bedrock principle of the law,\nthat in order to claim constructive eviction, you\nactually have to leave.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what happens -- in other\nwords, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to\nclear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and\nhorrible-smelling things all over. And then the\nfranchisee leaves, but the franchisor says: Hey, I\ndidn't want you to leave; that's your problem. I mean,\nthat's constructive eviction or constructive\ntermination?\nMR. O'NEIL: That's exactly right, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now suppose it's the same\nsituation, but this person, the franchisee, being quite\nindefatigable and daring, finds a way of sneaking\nthrough the barbed wire that has been put up. And\nthere's one pump they forgot, and there's a car that\ncomes up, and he serves that person. Now is it\nconstructive eviction?\nMR. O'NEIL: No, and that's where --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No?\nMR. O'NEIL: That's where an objective\nstandard is important, because we don't look to the\nparticularly clever --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Objective? You'd say any\nsensible person would clear out immediately. There are\nlions and tigers roaming the gas station.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. O'NEIL: That's exactly right, and that's\nwhy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And suppose he doesn't,\nthough, that he doesn't clear out because he's not\nsensible, and he just desperately needs the money.\nMR. O'NEIL: If the franchisee does not leave,\nthen he does not state a claim for constructive\ntermination. And that is how the law operates in every\nother area in which this doctrine applies. So if a\ncivil rights plaintiff claims discrimination on the\nbasis of race or gender, she cannot stay in her job and\nat the same time claim that she was fired. I mean\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the\nclaim of -- of the -- the Petitioners that only one of\nthe three contracts has been terminated?\nMR. O'NEIL: Well, as I said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The other two continue --\ncontinue in effect?\nMR. O'NEIL: As I said, if one of the three\nelements of the -- of the statutory franchise has been\nterminated, then that is a termination under the Act.\nAnd that's how the Act defines franchise. It defines it\nby all three elements of the franchise, and so if one of\nthem is terminated, that is a termination.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you -- we often\ntalk about price adjustments as causing the disputes\nbetween the franchisee and the franchisor. To what\nextent in these sets of contracts is the right of the\nfranchisor to adjust the price controlled by terms of\nthe contract?\nMR. O'NEIL: In general, these are open --\nopen-term price contracts, so that in these -- in these\nleases, for example, Shell had the right to set the\nprice of fuel using a formula that it formulated in its\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is the formula required\nby the contract, or it's just its own discretion to use\nthe formula?\nMR. O'NEIL: It's just in its discretion to\nuse the formula.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nMR. O'NEIL: It's an open price term. But\nU.C.C. 2305 would imply in most contracts a -- a\nrequirement that, where there is an open price term,\nthere can't be unreasonable increases in the -- in the\nprice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. O'NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Farraher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. FARRAHER, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF MAC'S SHELL SERVICE, INC., ET AL.\nMR. FARRAHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn this case, the jury determined that Shell\nand Motiva engaged in conduct designed -- prohibited by\nthe PMPA when they raised rent to force dealers out of\nbusiness and convert their stations to direct\noperations. Nevertheless, Shell and Motiva argue that\nconduct designed to force the dealers out of business is\ninsufficient to invoke statutory protection because the\ndealers were not deprived of any of the statutory\nelements of the franchise, and they remained in business\nfor some period following the rental increase.\nIf accepted, the practical effect of Shell and\nMotiva's position will allow franchisors to circumvent\nthe PMPA and terminate franchises at any time, at any\nreason, by simply increasing the burden on their\noperations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, these Petitioners\nremained in -- in business, is -- that's right?\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did they make money during\nthis period?\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, some of the\nPetitioners --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All but one remained in\nbusiness, isn't that correct?\nMR. FARRAHER: Some of the Petitioners\nremained in business, certainly, post-elimination of the\nsubsidy. The amount of time varied from person to\nperson.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if they do something\nreasonably designed -- a reasonable person would clear\nout, then why not clear out?\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, we have to\ntake this in context. This is a -- these are small\nbusiness owners who have invested their livelihoods in\noperating these franchises. They are trying to keep the\nbusiness operational against perhaps all odds and\nperhaps --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test?\nMR. FARRAHER: Pardon me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the test? Because if\nyou say we are going to give an action to a person who\ndidn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to\nget him to clear out, you are then going to convert into\na Federal action every single breach of contract or\nserious breach of contract that there is, which is the\nprecise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed\nthis statute.\nSo, what is your test as to we know that your\ncase is the lions and tigers case?\nMR. FARRAHER: Justice Breyer, I believe that\nyou hit on two points: First off, what is the test\nsufficient to invoke a constructive termination? And\nthen, secondly, a point that the panel has addressed is\nwhether or not abandonment of the franchise is required\nby the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't put it that way.\nI'd say constructive termination means you didn't\nterminate. Okay? That's what \"constructive\" means. It\nmeans you didn't do it. But sometimes a franchisor\ncould act in such a way that the law should treat it as\nif he really did. All right? I can imagine a test for\nthat.\nBut we have the second problem here, is that\neven if the conduct was designed -- it's equal to\nterminating it -- this individual didn't leave.\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he was still there running\nthe business. That's the part I would like to test for.\nMR. FARRAHER: The test, Your Honor -- first\noff, with respect to whether the conduct is sufficient\nto force a termination, we believe the First Circuit's\nstandard of materiality, which is effective to end one\nof the components of the statutorily defined franchise,\nis sufficient.\nWith respect to the second part of your\nquestion, which is why didn't these dealers leave the\nstation, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I want to know your test\nfor deciding -- even though the first part is met, how\nyou apply it when the person didn't leave? I understand\na person who left. He left.\nMR. FARRAHER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The franchisor says: I\ndidn't tell him to leave. And then you go look to see\nif the franchisor's conduct was so bad, it was the same\nas if you told him to leave. I've got that part.\nThe part I don't have is what happens if he\ndoesn't leave? Because one thing we know, the conduct\nwasn't so bad that this person left, because he didn't\nleave. That's that second part that's bothering me.\nMR. FARRAHER: And Your Honor, I'm not sure\nthere's a test for that, but certainly the statute\ndoesn't contemplate that the dealer would have to leave.\nFor example, the injunctive remedy in the statute would\nallow a dealer to come in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I need -- the injunctive\nremedies in the State court?\nMR. FARRAHER: They are different, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. But the\nreason I need a test is because the other side is\nsaying: I know what the test is; the test is he has to\nleave.\nMR. FARRAHER: But that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if you -- if you can show\nme some cases or a test or something where he didn't\nhave to leave, even though the franchisor's conduct was\nso bad that a reasonable person would have left, then\nI'm on to something and I know where to go.\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor -- and the point is\nthat I don't think the franchisee need necessarily leave\nas contemplated by the statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Breyer asked you\nfor a test. Maybe this would help you. If you are the\ntrial judge, how do you instruct the jury to determine\nwhen there has been a constructive termination? You\nhave to have an instruction.\nMR. FARRAHER: And that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm quite frankly amazed\nthat you say you don't have a test.\nMR. FARRAHER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're coming up here and\ntelling us that there's such a thing as a constructive\ntermination, I mean -- but then you don't have a test\nfor it?\nMR. FARRAHER: We do have a test, Your Honor,\nand the test is whether or not the conduct has\neffectively eliminated an essential component of one of\nthe three elements of the franchise. In this case, the\nFirst Circuit used a materiality standard that said that\nthe lease was effectively ended. And in the context of\nthe statute, the franchise as defined by the three\nelements, what the judge asked the jury to determine\nwas, was the agreement that Shell entered into with\nthese franchisees, with the essential component being\nthe subsidy, was that effectively eliminated --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does that mean,\n\"effectively eliminated\"? The -- the First Circuit\nsaid, if \"the breach of the lease was such a material\nchange that it effectively ended the lease, even though\nthe plaintiffs continued to operate the business\" -- I\nhave no idea what that means. What does it mean to\neffectively end the lease even though the lease\ncontinues?\nMR. FARRAHER: Yes, Your Honor, Justice Alito.\nThe statute contemplates a distinction in the\nrelationship between a franchise, which is a set of\ncontracts, and a franchise relationship. A franchise\nrelationship continues after the expiration of the -- of\nthe franchise.\nIn this case here what the judge was charging\nthe jury was -- what the question was, was the breach of\nthe lease so material that it effectively ended the --\nthe agreement that Shell had entered into with its\ndealers, regardless of the fact that there was some\nrelationship that continued with the parties afterwards?\nIn other words --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I know, but could you put that\nin somewhat more concrete terms, or can you not get any\nmore specific than to say the lease is effectively\nended?\nMR. FARRAHER: We -- we think that that\ncertainly was a sufficient standard. The circuit courts\nthat have decided the issue have arguably employed a\nlower standard. They have talked about a breach of one\nof the franchise agreements being sufficient. But\ncertainly we believe the First Circuit set an\nappropriate standard here with the materiality being --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any\narea of the law, other than this one, if you are right,\nin which a termination includes a non-termination; that\nis, where a constructive termination includes situations\nwhere the operation continues?\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, certainly in our --\nin our briefs we have referred to cases where\nconstructive evictions in some settings will allow a\ntenant to stay in a premises. Certainly, the -- the\nmajority of the cases decided in the discharge context\nor an eviction setting do require what you have\nsuggested, which is an end in that the person leaves\ntheir employment or leaves their --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I may be incorrect. I -- I\nthought your friends for the Petitioners said there is\nno case in which there's a constructive eviction but\nwhere the lessee remains on the premises. Maybe I\nmisheard.\nWhat is -- what is your principal case where\nthe lessee remains on the premises, but there is a\nconstructive eviction?\nMR. FARRAHER: Justice Kennedy, on page 38 of\nthe main brief in the footnote, we've cited two cases in\nNew Jersey that allow for that proposition. Certainly,\nconceding that the majority of the courts have held that\nan -- the tenant leaving the premise in a constructive\neviction setting is a necessary prerequisite to the\nclaim. But we also recognize that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we -- can -- perhaps\nto bring this to more practical terms, you can walk\nthrough with me. I'm going to assume that if a\nfranchisor changes a rent term and the franchisee\nrefuses to pay, wouldn't the franchisor at some point\ngive a notice of termination? What franchisor is going\nto sit through months and months and years of waiting\nfor payment before kicking someone out? Is it -- is\nthat rationally going to happen in any situation?\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I would -- I would\nconcede that in all likelihood, a franchisor would take\nsome affirmative conduct, whether that be through a\nnotice of termination or other step. But, yes, that\nwould happen.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or -- or, so that in\nalmost all situations, at least with respect to the\nleased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the\ntermination would be -- would have to happen.\nMR. FARRAHER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do we need to make\na constructive eviction theory when, on a practical\nbasis, there always in this situation has to be a notice\nof termination, at least with respect to the premises\npart?\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, I -- I\nrespectfully disagree. And I think the government and\nShell would both concede that written notification,\nalthough required by the statute, is not necessarily\nalways going to be given.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know. But at some point\nthe franchisor is going to have to take over the\npremises, either by trying to evict the person or\nlocking them out. No -- no rational franchisor is going\nto raise rent, not have the franchisee pay, and fail to\nterminate the agreement.\nMR. FARRAHER: That -- that may be true, Your\nHonor. But in this case here what Shell's position is\nthat they can -- they can -- and -- and put such\nintolerable conduct at issue, for example, raising the\nrent by several hundred percent, and that doesn't\nconstitute a termination in any respect, even if -- even\nif the dealer were to leave.\nThey argue that they must affirmatively\nwithhold one of the statutory elements of the franchise\nfrom the dealer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the franchisee could\nalways just stop paying the rent. He doesn't have to\nleave the premises.\nMR. FARRAHER: That's right, Your Honor. And\nagain -- again the statute doesn't contemplate -- and --\nand we have to, again, go back to the statute to\nrecognize what the word \"termination\" means in the\ncontext of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act.\nCertainly, Shell envisions that it means that there must\nbe an end to the relationship.\nThe Solicitor would concede, I believe, that\nthe dealer could remain on the premises if there was\nsuch sufficient conduct to force them out of business\nthat a reasonable person would think they have no\nability to continue in business. But then the Solicitor\nimposes a condition that that franchisee must seek an\ninjunction in order to have a claim under the Act.\nOur position is that the injunction is a form\nof a relief to protect the franchisee, to maintain the\nstatus quo. But the existence of a claim under the\nstatute does not depend upon whether or not the\nfranchisee seeks the injunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't -- you\ndidn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge\nZobel thought it was -- it came much too late.\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, this -- this case\nhas had a -- a long history to it. The case was\ninitially filed as In the matter of Tsanikilides in the\nU.S. district court and assigned to Judge Zobel. Our\nprior counsel did seek an injunction. It's not clear on\nthe record why that injunction was withdrawn at the time\nthat the Tsanikilides case was dismissed.\nBut then when the Marcoux or the Mac's Shell\ncase was re-filed, it's correct that the dealers did not\ninitially move for injunctive relief. And I think there\nwere two reasons for that. Number one, it was always\ncontemplated with Judge Zobel that this matter would\nproceed on an expedited basis, that discovery would lead\nto trial within a very short period of time.\nAnd, number two, even though there is a\nrelaxed standard for injunctive relief, it was not clear\nthat the dealers would be able to sufficiently meet\ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate to the court that\nan injunction should be issued.\nAgain, we are dealing here in a practical\neffect of asking an oil company on a national basis to\nbe enjoined from implementing this change in rent that\nthey had brought about.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain to me --\nthe question I brought up before -- what was the\ndifference of the elements between the recovery that the\njury gave for constructive termination and for breach of\ncontract?\nMR. FARRAHER: The damages awarded were\nprecisely the same, and the judge instructed the jury\nthat, in fact, there would be no double recovery for\nthe -- for the dealers here, that they would only\nrecover once. The breach of contract was pled as an\nalternative theory. And the difference being that under\nthe PMPA the dealers were also awarded their attorneys'\nfees and expert witness fees as well, which was a -- a\nnumber north of a million dollars.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem that -- that I\nsee here is that if in fact you are right, that the --\nthe franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view.\nDid that breach rise to a termination? Did it rise to\nthat level?\nNow, it's simply a question, since he breached\nthe contract, of what court you are going to sue in, in\nyour view. If this isn't a termination, you sue in\nState court; if it is a termination, you sue in Federal\ncourt.\nSo, why -- why wouldn't we say, well, let him\nsue in State court, because if the person stays on the\npremises, everything becomes blurred. If you require\nhim to leave the premises, then it's clear. If you were\nto let him stay on the premises and also argue it's a\ntermination, we are going to have people coming into\nFederal court because they think there are more damages\nor something, I guess, or whatever reason. There will\nbe a whole lot of unclear cases. So it's better to have\na clear line.\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, again, the --\nthe reason that the dealers are coming to Federal court\nis because Congress enacted a statute to protect them --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are going to say they\nhave a right to, but the other side thinks they don't.\nSo it doesn't answer my question to just refer to the\nfact that you have a right to. My question is a\npractical question: What's the harm of sticking to the\nclear line that is normally there in other cases, in\nthis case not depriving your client of a remedy at all?\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just saying he goes to State\ncourt to get it.\nMR. FARRAHER: I disagree with the Court that\nthe client is not being deprived of a remedy. The\nremedy available in the statute in one part is\ninjunctive relief. And while the dealers did not avail\nthemselves of that in this particular case, the lesser\nstandard and the lack of a need to show irreparable harm\nprotects the franchisee under a Federal cause of action\nas distinguished from a contractual-based cause of\naction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a million\ndollars, right? That's the difference. You get\nattorneys' fees and expert fees in the Federal action,\nand presumably you don't in the State action.\nMR. FARRAHER: We -- we -- we do in this case,\nMr. Chief Justice. But in a case where a dealer comes\nto the court for relief and they have available to them\nthe injunctive remedy, which does not require the\nirreparable harm component be demonstrated, it keeps the\ndealer in business. Certainly Congress intended to\nprotect franchisees. They intended for competition in\nthe marketplace to continue. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have the\noption, right? If you accept the idea that there's a\nconstructive termination under your view, even if you\ndon't leave, I guess you have the option to stay in\nbusiness or to leave at any time.\nMR. FARRAHER: They certainly do, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and what happened here, obviously, is that the\noil company imposed such onerous conditions that they\nexpected dealers would leave. And, in fact, in\nMassachusetts within the time period of the\nelimination -- the formation of Motiva, within a 5-year\nperiod thereafter, the numbers dropped almost by 50\npercent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have a choice, you\nknow. So, here's your choice, dealer: Stay there and\nsue in State court, and by the way, if they are charging\nyou too much money under the contract and you are really\nhurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they\nare doing, go get an injunction in State court. See?\nThey have injunctions in State courts. That exists.\nMR. FARRAHER: They certainly do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or, you have the other\nchoice. Move out.\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then if you move out, you can\nsue under Federal law, and you will get all these other\nthings like the extra million dollars or something. So,\nmove out and get the extra money, or stay there and sue\nunder State court. Why is that a bad choice?\nMR. FARRAHER: It's -- it's a bad choice, Your\nHonor, because it puts the dealer in a position of\nhaving to determine whether they should abandon their\nlives' works in order to benefit from a -- from a\nFederal cause of action. It's a bad idea because in the\noil company's view, we don't get to make that choice,\neven despite their bad conduct unless they affirmatively\nstop providing us with one of the -- one of the\nstatutory elements of the franchise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, your -- your\napproach puts -- puts the company -- the oil company in\na very strange position. It doesn't know whether it has\na contract or not. It -- the contract is terminated if\nyour client says it's terminated. If he doesn't say\nit's terminated, it's not terminated. I mean, a very\nweird contract where you -- you're subject to the whim\nof the other party as to whether the contract continues\nor not.\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I think in the --\nwith -- again, with the injunctive relief available, a\ncourt could in the initial stages without the aid of\ndiscovery determine whether -- what the parties'\nobligations are during the course of the litigation.\nHere the dealers continued to pay the exorbitant rents\nthat were being charged. So I would argue that the oil\ncompany was at no point in time harmed by virtue of the\nclaim and then the proceedings that ensued.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know. They --\nyou know, if they knew that they were pulling out and --\nand were claiming a termination, they might have been\nlooking for somebody else to take over the franchise.\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor, I think, as a\npractical matter, that would not have happened during\nthe pendency of the litigation. So, again, to the\nextent that the -- an injunction had been sought, it\nwould have helped to preserve the status quo, and in\nthis case, again, here, the oil company was not in any\nway, shape, or form harmed by the dealers' pursuit of\ntheir claim because they continued to pay their rent,\nfor those that remained in business, and those that went\nout of business obviously stopped.\nYour Honors, if I may turn to the other claim,\nwhich is also present in this case here, the claim of\nthe non-renewal, both the government and Shell have\nsuggested that the statute imposes some sort of a\nmandatory mechanism requiring the franchisor to give\nnotice and then the dealer seeking an injunction within\n90 days in order -- in connection with the non-renewal\nclaim.\nI think, as a practical matter, we need to\nstart with the proposition of what the jury found here,\nand the jury found that, in this case, the oil company\nadded new terms to the lease specifically for the\npurposes of converting the franchise-operated stations\nto direct operations. They wanted the dealers out of\nbusiness, and they wanted to take over operations of\ntheir stations.\nHad the oil company issued a notice of\nnon-renewal when the parties didn't reach agreement on\nthe terms of the agreement and this case had proceeded\nto a trial, there is no question, but that the result\nwould have been exactly the same as the result is here.\nSo the question we are facing is whether or\nnot this mechanism that they have advanced as being\nthe -- the only way, the exclusive remedy to proceed is,\nin fact, such, and we would argue that, in fact, it is\nnot. Both the government and the Solicitor have\nconceded already that, while the statute requires notice\nin the normal course, that, certainly, notice can be\nside-stepped, and that conduct can give rise to notice.\nThe next question then would be whether or not\nthe dealer must seek injunctive relief as a prerequisite\nto maintaining a claim, and we argue that there is\nnothing in the language of the statute suggesting that\nthe injunction is mandatory.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The theory of it is to\nprotect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a\ncompany that says, we are not going to renew your lease.\nAnd they are unreasonable, and the dealers think. The\nstatute says: Fine, don't renew it, okay? And, here,\nwe'll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt.\nIf you really think he's wrong, go sue for an\ninjunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra\nbonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff.\nSo we protected you a lot.\nNow, why should there be a third thing that\nthe statute says nothing about, which nobody's ever\nheard of? You just stay there, and you say: I'm going\nto just do business every day, just like nothing\nhappened, and I write the words under protest.\nI mean, why would Congress have gone to all\nthat trouble if that's all you have to do?\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, certainly, Your Honor,\nthe language of the statute itself, while the -- while\nCongress provides for injunctive relief, which would be\napplicable equally to non-renewal claims as it would to\ntermination claims, and while the statute speaks to\nnotice, again, applicable to both, there is absolutely\nnothing in the statutory language that says this is a\nmandatory exhaustion of remedies.\nYou must seek an injunction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but there is a purpose,\nand the purpose is that this system at least brings a\njudge in to see if that dealer really does have enough\nof a claim to get this relaxed injunction. But your\nsystem leaves it 100 percent up to that dealer. It\ncould be heard of that dealer really doesn't have a good\nclaim, and all he does is write the words \"under\nprotest.\"\nMR. FARRAHER: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have a judge in\nit, at that stage, under your interpretation.\nMR. FARRAHER: We think that our case,\ncertainly, is distinguishable from the other two\ncircuits that have addressed the issue. In our case,\nour dealers filed a lawsuit before they were presented\nwith the leases for signature. They told the oil\ncompany that they were signing under protest, with a\nreservation of all their rights.\nIt was the oil company that presented the\nleases to them on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. They\nsaid, there will be no negotiation of these terms, and\nyou must sign, and if you don't sign, we are going to\nissue a notice of non-renewal. And then that pins the\ncontinuation of the dealers' business on the hopes that,\neven with a relaxed standard, a trial court is going to\nissue an injunction.\nAnd I certainly don't think that the statute\nor the Congress intended for the dealers to risk their\nbusinesses on the likelihood of getting the injunctive\nrelief --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I ask you,\nhave you accepted the majority's reasoning in the Dersch\ncase, the Seventh Circuit case, with respect to 2805(f)?\nYou haven't raised that argument in your brief, so\nobviously, you have accepted their view that 2805(f)\ndoesn't apply to the right to preserve your claims of\nimproper --\nMR. FARRAHER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Are you\n-- are you asking whether we accept the proposition that\nthe -- the waiver of rights --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Seventh Circuit said\nthere's no implied right of action under 2805(f).\nMR. FARRAHER: The Seventh Circuit, if I\nunderstand the case correctly, Your Honor, says that\nthere's no implied cause of action under 2805(f)\nstanding alone, that if a franchisor is insisting upon a\nterm that includes a waiver, as in connection with\nnon-renewal, then the Dersch decision in the Seventh\nCircuit would say that that might be actionable under\n2802(b)(3) because they have introduced a term that is\nnot agreed upon and is designed for the purposes of\nforcing the dealers out of business.\nI don't know that we have taken an opinion,\nwhether or not there's an independent or implied cause\nof action standing alone under 2805(f).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I would have thought\nyour strongest argument would have been that, if we have\na statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or\nState rights, if there has been a non-renewal on\nreasonable terms, there has been a breach of that\nobligation under the statute, then you had a right to be\nrenewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving\nyou unreasonable terms -- \"unreasonable\" being defined\nwithin the statutory constraints -- they impose\nconditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you\nout; those are the two conditions -- then you had a\nright to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a\nright to renew on reasonable terms.\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I appreciate the --\nthe argument, and, certainly, I -- I think it is\nsupportive of the dealers' claims in this case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but why didn't you\nmake the argument in your briefs? That's why I was\nasking you whether you agreed with the Seventh Circuit's\nreasoning, and that's why you didn't raise it or -- what\nam I missing, that's making that argument not -\nMR. FARRAHER: I think it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- one that you relied\nupon?\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I can't answer, in\nhindsight, why we didn't raise it in the brief, but I do\nhear the position that you are advocating and think it\nis supportive of the -- of the dealers' position here.\nIf there are no additional questions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just getting back to\nthe constructive eviction, I took a quick look at the\nMarini and Ireland case that you cite, and I think\nthe -- the Petitioner is correct. There, the tenant\nleft part of the premises, and it was a constructive\neviction as to that part. And it's a 1970 case.\nI just don't think you have many cases to help\nyou in the constructive eviction area. It's kind of\nlike the Holmes -- Sherlock, not Oliver Wendell --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that says the dog doesn't\nbark. I mean, there is this huge body of\nlandlord/tenant law, and you have just a few cases, and\none of them, at least, doesn't appear to support you.\nMR. FARRAHER: Your Honor, I -- I guess the --\nthe best response I have to that proposition is that we\nare not dealing in a traditional landlord/tenant context\nhere. We are dealing under a statutory scheme that\nCongress enacted to protect franchisees, and we need to\nlook within the meaning of the statute as to what\ntermination means.\nI would also say that, in the landlord/tenant\ncontext, while the, perhaps, outdated notion of a\nconstructive eviction would require the tenant to leave,\ncases seem to suggest, in a more modern sense, that the\nrelationship between the landlord and the tenant is more\nof a contractual relationship in nature and, as such,\nallows for the traditional remedies available under\ncontract law, in turning -- including self-help and\nrescission, et cetera.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Lamken, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS\nCOMPANY, LLC, ET AL.\nMR. LAMKEN: Thank you.\nI believe the debate in this case comes down\nto about three issues: The first is what is the\nrelevant background principle we think Congress was\nlooking to when it used the words \"terminate,\"\n\"non-renew,\" and \"cancel\" in the statute. We think the\nmost analogous background principles they would have\nbeen looking to were contract law and the State\nfranchise statutes that existed at the time Congress\nacted. I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it\ntrue that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's\nfeeling that the common law rules were really not\nsufficient because, under the common law, of course,\nthey could just non-renew because they wanted to take\nover the franchise themselves. And under the statute,\nthat is not permissible. So there's a major change\nthat's created by the statute, which suggests, to me,\nthat maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting\ncommon law.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. There was a deficiency in\nthe common law, but it was limited to one point, and\nthat was termination and non-renewal. It wasn't that\nbreaches of contract -- and as the government has\nexplained, a breach of contract here is a precondition\nto a constructive termination claim -- were\ninsufficiently remedied by State law. That was not the\nissue before Congress.\nThe issue before Congress was that there was a\ncontractual right to terminate at will or for trivial\nreasons or to non-renew for no reason or bad reasons\neven, and that is what Congress regulated, was\nterminations and non-renewals, in that sense, not\nbreaches of contract that turned out to be really bad.\nThe second thing is that because there was a\ncomprehensive State remedy, there is particularly little\nreason to read this statute, this narrow statute,\nexpansively, particularly given that this is an\nexpressly preemptive -- a potentially conflict\npreemption statute, which could have the effect of\ndisplacing State law.\nWhen you're looking at a statute that's\nnarrowly looking at termination or non-renewal, you\nwould not ordinarily expand those terms to include\nreally bad breaches of contract, because that has the\npotential to displace State statutory and potentially\nState common law under the preemption clause.\nAnd, finally, the last piece that comes up is\nthe problem of evasion. The issue becomes sort of,\nwell, people can just get around this statute if there\nis no constructive termination cause of action. And the\nanswer to that is: There is no problem with evasion,\nbecause everything that's covered by constructive\ntermination has to be a breach of contract. State law\nhas this comprehensively covered. Increasing the price\nterms on an open price term? U.C.C. 2-305, under which\nplaintiff's recovered here, has that covered. So the --\nextending the Federal statute really adds very little.\nAnd the second point is that even under the\nPMPA today, constructive termination has been rejected\n-- every -- except in the narrow area of assignments,\nunder the theory that an assignment followed by a breach\nis somehow a constructive termination, a theory which I\ndon't think we or the government thinks makes any sense.\nBut that's where it exists. And yet there's no record\noutside the area of assignment of these grand evasions\nby boosting up all the prices in violation of the\ncontract.\nAnd the risk of expanding constructive\ntermination here is it projects Federal law into\ndeciding whether or not it's going to prohibit\nparticular price terms, particular conditions,\nparticular things dealing with the rent and the\npremises, something that Congress stayed away from and\nleft to the States. What Congress regulated here were\nthe narrow issues of termination and non-renewal, not\nthe substantive content of the franchise relationship.\nIf there are no questions, we ask that the\njudgment with respect to termination be reversed and the\njudgment with respect to non-renewal be affirmed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nSo the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at
