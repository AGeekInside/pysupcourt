        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 07-582, Federal\nCommunications Commission versus Fox Television\nStations.\nMr. Garre. Solicitor General Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis case involves a challenge to the\nefforts of the Federal Communications Commission to\ncarry out its statutory mandate under 18 U.S.C. 1464,\nand more even-handedly address indecent material that is\nbroadcast directly into the home during the time of day\nwhen children are likely to be in the viewing audience.\nAfter reconsidering its policy in this area,\nthe Commission determined that an enforcement action may\nbe appropriate in the case of indecent language that is\nisolated as well as repeated. Because the Commission\nprovided a reasoned explanation for that change in\ncourse, the court of appeals erred in invalidating its\naction under the Administrative Procedures Act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it -- did it reconsider\nits policy? In the first order, I would -- I would have\ngathered that it had, but its second order said\nbasically, we've never had a policy that single use of\nthese expletives is okay. Which is it? Are they\nchanging their policy or not?\nGENERAL GARRE: They did change the policy,\nJustice Scalia, and the Commission directly acknowledged\nthat in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order,\nwhich is not reprinted in the petition appendix. In\nthat paragraph, the Commission said, \"We now depart from\ncases holding that isolated or fleeting use of the\nF-Word was not indecent.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The latest order, the one\nthat's up here, says that all of the statements to that\neffect in the past were simply staff statements and that\nthe Commission had never held to that effect before.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, the court of appeals\nrecognized, and we think correctly so, that the\nCommission did change its position on that. The\nCommission had never brought an enforcement action\nagainst a broadcaster for the isolated use of an\nexpletive, and the Commission made clear in the orders\nit issued in this case, beginning with the Golden Globe\nAwards order and the particular omnibus and remand\norders before this Court, that it was taking a change in\nregulatory course in determining that it was appropriate\nto bring an enforcement action where there was an\nisolated incident of an expletive if the context\nsuggested that it would be indecent in that situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the agency's\nposition that its policy has changed or that it has not\nchanged?\nGENERAL GARRE: That it has changed,\nJustice Kennedy, and the court of appeals recognized\nthat at pages 20a to 21a of the decision. And we think\nthis Court has recognized --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the court\nrecognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is\nwhat Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the\nremand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I think there were\nsome statements, we would acknowledge that, in different\nplaces. But if you go to the heart of where the FCC\ngrappled with this, paragraph -- paragraph 12 of the\nGolden Globe Awards order, it specifically disavowed its\nprior decisions in which it had said that isolated\nexpletives would not warrant an enforcement action under\n1464, and it specifically said, \"we are departing from\nour policy.\" We -- after all, it didn't impose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I think it rewrote that\nin its last order, and I think it even explained away\nthe Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as\ncategorical as it might appear.\nGENERAL GARRE: I think if you look at maybe\npages 82 to 83 of the petition appendix here, where we\ndiscuss that as well, I think it made clear with respect\nto the indecency finding involving the 2003 Billboard\nMusic Awards and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, that\nin applying its contextual analysis in the past it\nfocused on whether or not expletives were repeated or\ndwelled upon. In this case, the Commission determined\nthat it was not going to be guided exclusively by that\nconsideration and that it was going to take into account\nall contextual factors, including the explicit and\ngraphic nature of the language used.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think, in\nterms of our legal review, it makes a difference whether\nit's a change or whether it's a continuation of a prior\npolicy?\nGENERAL GARRE: Certainly, I would be\ndefending it if the Court thought that it wasn't a\nchange, and it would have been inappropriate for the\nSecond Circuit to invalidate that as arbitrary and\ncapricious. We have -- we think it was a change. The\nlanguage that the Commission used indicated that it was\ndeparting from its prior understanding, and we are here\ndefending -- either way, we are here defending --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question\nis, do you think a different legal standard applies when\nan agency changes a prior position as opposed to\narticulating its position for the first time?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, this Court has said\nthat it's desirable for agencies to reconsider and to\nchange its policy from time to time, but when --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't the Commission --\nthe Commission asked the Second Circuit, said: We've\nchanged our policy; we want you to remand the case to\nthe Commission so the Commission can explain what its\nnew policy. I mean, isn't that how this whole thing\narose? The case was in the Second Circuit and the\nCommission said it wanted to have an opportunity to\nexplain its position more fully?\nGENERAL GARRE: It is, and it did in the\nremand order reprinted in the petition appendix.\nMr. Chief Justice, I think either way the\nultimate standard is arbitrary and capriciousness. Now,\nthe Respondents have focused on whether or not we have\ncomplied with the criteria that the Court has looked to\nin determining whether or not a change in agency\nposition is arbitrary and capricious. And we think that\nthere are three factors here that must lead to the\nconclusion that it was not arbitrary and capricious.\nOne, we think that the Commission did\ndirectly acknowledge its change in position. Two, the\nCommission provided a concrete explanation for that\nchange. And, three, that explanation is at a minimum\nplausible and consistent with the Commission's statutory\nmandate. This Court has never invalidated a change in\nagency position where those three factors have been\npresent.\nAnd if you look at the three principal\njustifications that the agency used in explaining its\nchange in position, I think it's absolutely clear that\nthis was at a minimum a rational policy choice that the\nagency was committed -- was permitted to take under the\nAdministrative Procedures Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the problems is\nthat, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme\nor reason for some of the decisions that the Commission\nhas made. I mean, the \"Saving Private Ryan\" case was\nfilled with expletives, and yet the film about jazz\nhistory, the words were considered a violation of the\nCommission's policies. So that there seems to be very\nlittle rhyme or reason to when the Commission says that\none of these words is okay and when it says it isn't.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we do think, of\ncourse, that there is rhyme or reason to its\ndetermination. First, let me say that much of the\nvagueness type of arguments that the Respondents are\nmaking similar to your question could be made equally\nwith respect to the Commission's policy with respect to\nrepeated utterances as well as isolated utterances.\nIf you take the \"Saving Private Ryan\" and\nthe blues documentary example, those were repeated-\nutterances cases. We are here because they challenged\nthe Commission's change in policy to go from repeated\nutterances to consider enforcement actions in the case\nof isolated expletives where they met its contextual\nanalysis and where it was explicit, graphic, shocking or\npandering in the context.\nNow, I think certainly there are going to be\nsituations and this Court has indicated that the\nvagueness inquiry doesn't turn about coming up with\nhypotheticals at -- at the outer margins of the\nstandard.\nI think in the Pacifica case our reading of\nthe Court's decision is similar to the D.C. Circuit's\nreading of that decision in the Action for Children's\nTelevision case, that implicit in the Court's decision\nin Pacifica was that it rejected a vagueness challenge\nto the Commission's definition of \"indecency,\" which is\nthe same definition that the Commission is applying\ntoday.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the most\ndifficult case for you is the \"Early News\" case where\nyou have just a fleeting expletive, unlike \"Saving\nPrivate Ryan\" and the others. I mean, how do you\ndistinguish the \"Early News\" case from the ones before\nus?\nGENERAL GARRE: The Commission has\ndetermined that news programming would be treated\ndifferently, with greater restraint, because of the\ndifferent values present in that situation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the same -- if\nyou had a news report about Nicole Richey and the Cher\nexhibits, they -- they could use the actual language,\neven though they can't during the -- the awards shows?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes. And, similarly, if\nthere were a news report about the argument today in\nthis Court and there were reports about the actual\nlanguage used, that's right. The Commission has\nexercised restraint in that area, recognizing that there\nare different values at stake than in the -- in the\nutterance of indecent language during a prime-time\nbroadcast where are a substantial number of children in\nthe viewing audience.\nFor the broadcast in this case, up to 24 to\n28 percent of the viewing audience comprised children\nunder the age of 18. This language was concededly\ngratuitous in the context it was used. In the Nicole\nRichey example in 2003, there was an element of\npandering as part of the dialogue consisted of Paris\nHilton saying, \"Watch your language,\" before Nicole\nRichey launched into dropping the S-Word and the F-Word\nin -- in a context that was, the FCC reasonably\ndetermined, was shocking and gratuitous and explicit and\ngraphic; and, therefore, in the context in which it was\npresented, indecent under the agency's longstanding\ndefinition of \"indecency.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there only those two\nwords in the FCC's new policy or are there other words\non the list?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, certainly, the FCC's\naction in this case focuses on the use of the F-Word and\nthe S-Word, and I think everyone acknowledges that a\nword like the F-Word is one of the most graphic,\nexplicit, and vulgar words in the English language for\nsexual activity. And I think even the networks here\nconcede that it was -- its use was gratuitous and\ninappropriate here. And that would control --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that --\nisn't it true that that is a word that often is used\nwith -- with no reference whatsoever to the -- the\nsexual connotation?\nGENERAL GARRE: It can be -- it certainly\ncan be used in a non-literal way. It can be used in a\nmetaphorical way, as Cher used it here, to say \"F them\"\nto her critics. But the -- the non-literal/literal\ndistinction is not unique to the isolated expletives\nversus the repeated effort -- expletives.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think it's equally --\nit's equally subject to being treated as indecent within\nthe meaning of the statute regardless of which meaning\nwas actually apparent to everybody who listened to it?\nGENERAL GARRE: I wouldn't say equally,\nJustice Stevens, but what we would say is that it can\nqualify as indecent under the -- under the Commission's\ndefinition, because even the non-literal use of a word\nlike the F-Word, because of the core meaning of that\nword as one of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit\nwords for sexual activity in the English language, it\ninevitably conjures up a core sexual image.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is, indeed, why it's\nused.\nGENERAL GARRE: Which is, indeed, why it's\nused as an intensifier or as an insult, and it's why the\nnetworks themselves -- and this is reprinted, I believe,\nat 86 of the petition appendix -- have a 24-hour rule\nthat the F-Word generally should not be use on TV.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is an\nentirely voluntary -- I mean, the Commission would have\nno objection if the F-Word were used on a regular basis\nafter 10:00 o'clock?\nGENERAL GARRE: Outside of the safe harbor\nunder this Court's decision, the -- the Commission\nrecognizes that networks can use indecent language.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Although they don't, I\ngather.\nGENERAL GARRE: Although they don't. Their\npolicies are not to use indecent language.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because they find it\noffensive, I gather.\nGENERAL GARRE: Because I think they\nrecognize that it contravenes community standards for\nappropriateness in the broadcast medium, and that --\nthose policies are reprinted at pages 86a to 88a of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How are the contemporary\ncommunity standards determined in this context? Does\nthe FCC survey any particular audience to find out what\ntheir standards are?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, first of all, the\ncommunity standards are community standards for the\nbroadcast medium. This is set out a little bit at page\n33 of the joint appendix at footnote 13. Second of all,\nthey look to community standards for the average\nlistener. And, third of all, the -- the Commission\napplies its expressly -- collective experience here,\nlooking to statements from lawmakers, from courts, from\nbroadcasters, from public interest groups, and from\ncitizens to determine what is consistent with community\nstandards. And certainly the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the\nbroadcasters' own voluntary determination not to use\nthat -- that language 24 hours is a reflection of what\nthey think about community standards.\nGENERAL GARRE: Absolutely. I think it is\nan irrefutable reflection of what they think the\nappropriate community standards are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you talking about\ncommunity standards for broadcasting?\nGENERAL GARRE: Community standards for\nbroadcasting, that's right. And, in that respect, this\ncase is much different than the Reno case, for example,\nwhere one of the criticisms this Court had was\nuncertainty about what community standards would apply.\nAnother difference is -- is that here you\nhave the Commission, an expert agency, making these\ndetermining -- making these determinations, drawing in\npart on the policies and practices of the regulated\nindustry itself; for example, the self-imposed rule not\nto use the F-Word at particular times of day.\nAnd, of course, you have the fact that\nbroadcast television has always been subject to a lesser\nstandard of First Amendment scrutiny. Now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Still, I gather\nthat's at issue with the constitutional questions. Does\nthat still have the same force today when the broadcast\nmedium is only one of several that are -- that are\navailable? In other words, it seems to me that the\nCommission might not be accomplishing terribly much if\nit regulates a particular medium when all sorts of other\nmedia, media, are available that don't have the\nCommission's oversight.\nGENERAL GARRE: We think it is, and we think\nit is reflected in the Court's cases. Let me -- and let\nme explain why. But let me first say that obviously we\nthink that this Court does not need to, and should not,\ndelve into the constitutional issues in resolving the\ncase before it today.\nThe only issue that we have presented and\nthe only issue decided below is whether or not the\nCommission has provided a reasoned explanation of the\nAdministrative Procedures Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I ask? You\ncan go ahead. Are you finished?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, if -- if I can answer\nthe question as to the force of the Court's precedents,\nthis Court has repeatedly affirmed in cases like Sable,\nin cases like Reno, in cases like Turner and Denver\nArea, that broadcasting is subject to a different and\nlesser First Amendment standard.\nThe Commission in this case looked to the\nconsiderations that underlie that jurisprudential\ndoctrine and concluded that they were still apposite,\nand that is at pages 108 to 110 of the petition\nappendix.\nMost Americans still get their information\nand entertainment from broadcast TV. Most children --\nbroadcast TV is extremely accessible to children because\nall they have to do is turn it on, and then they have\nnetwork shows that they can have access to. And\nbroadcast television is still broadcast in a way that\ninvades the home, the place -- the one place where\npeople typically don't expect to have uninvited,\noffensive --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but wasn't the\nrationale for the lesser standard largely the scarcity\nof the frequencies?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think that was the\nrationale in Red -- Red Lion. This is Court in Pacifica\ndidn't rely on that rationale.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it relied on it in Red\nLion?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes. I -- as we read the\ndecision, Justice Stevens -- and I understand that you\nwrote the plurality decision there. But, as we read the\ndecision, the Court did not rest so much on the scarcity\nrationale, but, yet, on the unique pervasiveness of\nbroadcasting, the unique accessibility to children, and\nthe fact that broadcasting invades the home in a way\nthat other technologies do not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was before the\nInternet. Pacifica was in 1978.\nGENERAL GARRE: It was, Your Honor. Now, in\nthe Turner case this Court said at page 190 that\nbroadcast medium is still the principal source of\ninformation in entertainment in affirming the lesser\nstandard that this Court applies.\nWe actually think that the fact that there\nare now additional mediums like the internet and cable\nTV, if anything, underscores the appropriateness of a\nlower First Amendment standard or safety zone for\nbroadcast TV, because Americans who want to get indecent\nprogramming can go to cable TV, they can go to the\nInternet.\nBut broadcast TV is, as Congress designed\nthat to be, the one place where Americans can turn on\nthe TV at 8:00 o'clock and watch their dinner and not be\nexpected to be bombarded with indecent language, either\nin an isolated basis or repeated basis. That's a\nsocietal expectation that has grown up over the last\n30 years since Pacifica. And it would be a remarkable\nthing to adopt the world that the networks are asking\nyou to adopt here today, where the networks are free to\nuse expletives, whether in an isolated or repeated\nbasis, 24 hours a day, going from the extreme example of\nBig Bird dropping the F-bomb on Sesame Street, to the\nexample of using that word during Jeopardy or opening\nthe episode of American Idol --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just have a practical\nquestion. I'm just curious about this. What are the\nnetworks supposed to do, or the television stations?\nThey cover a lot of live events. They're not just\nsports events. They're also like but the Golden -- you\nknow, the Emmys, the Oscars, and you deal with a\ncross-section of humanity. And my experience is some\nparts of that cross-section swear.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what is it -- what are\nthey supposed to do when the event is live, and lo and\nbehold, they have a few people in front of them who\nswear, using these words? What is their -- what can\nthey do?\nGENERAL GARRE: With respect to live\nentertainment programming, Justice Breyer, you can do\nwhat the networks now do, which is to have a tape delay\nwhich permits you to bleep out isolated or offensive --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what they -- what they\nnow -- they now do this? In other words, whenever they\ncover a baseball game, whenever they cover anything\nlive, they have to have some kind of tape system or for\nthe Emmys, everything is on tape and it's all delayed\nfive seconds?\nGENERAL GARRE: No. It varies based on the\ntype of programming. For example, the Commission has\nacknowledged -- and this is at pages 94 to 95a of the\npetition appendix -- that their -- that breaking news\ncoverage is different and that it will not approach it\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about\nbreaking news coverage. I guess I'm talking about, you\nknow, any one of -- they cover the wrestling matches,\nthey cover -- you see what I'm driving at. And I would\nlike to know what is the state of the art? You are\nsaying the state of the art is right now when I turn on\nmy television set, they all use a delay.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't think --\nthat's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or are you saying they all\nhave to use a delay?\nGENERAL GARRE: In a show like the Billboard\nMusic Awards, they will use a delay. And since the\nincidents in this case, the 2003 and 2002 instances, the\nnetworks have gotten more people who are on hand to\nbleep isolated expletives.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They had a 5-second delay\nat the time these things occurred, didn't they?\nGENERAL GARRE: They did, and I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it wasn't -- it wasn't\nthat they weren't fast enough or something?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, if you look at the\nNicole Richie example, they actually bleeped one word\nthat was used, I believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, right.\nGENERAL GARRE: -- before she got to the\nother two words. But at that time they only had one\nperson working the bleeping machine or whatever it is\nthey call it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on whom you are\ndealing with, right?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think that's right. But\ncertainly there is an understanding that this is -- that\nthese isolated --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did the FCC explain all\nthis in its opinion when it said, we understand that now\nwe're going to have to -- every incident is going to\nhave to be -- have a 5-second delay and they will have\nto have tapes, and we think it's worth the cost? Did\nthey explain all that?\nGENERAL GARRE: It explained that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see it.\nGENERAL GARRE: -- in its decision in the\npetition appendix here as to the basis why enforcement\naction would be appropriate. Because here you are\ndealing with individuals who have used inappropriate in\nthe past -- Nicole Richie had used inappropriate\nlanguage in the past. You had an inappropriate tape\ndelay, you had inappropriate measures in place to ensure\nthat expletives were not used, which in the Commission's\njudgment meant that this would be an appropriate\nsituation.\nIf you had a different context, say a\nsporting event where there is an isolated expletive as\npart of a post-game news interview, the Commission as it\nwould under its context-based approach, would look to\nall the contextual factors and determine whether or not\nit was indecent in that situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This Paris Hilton incident\nwas scripted. The use of the indecent word was almost\ninvited, wasn't it?\nGENERAL GARRE: Certainly our view is that\nit was pandering and invited. It could have been\nexpected.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there a different\nword? Wasn't there a euphemism in the script? I\nthought there was a euphemism in the script.\nGENERAL GARRE: The euphemism in the script\nI think was \"freaking\", and another euphemism for the\nS-Word, but they obviously departed from that. And I\nthink the Commission --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it was sort of an\ninvitation. I mean, before she was introduced, said,\n\"Now we're on live television, you have to watch your\nmouth\", or something like that.\nGENERAL GARRE: That's what Paris Hilton\nsaid. I mean, I think the whole thing was set up to be\npandering --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was a setup.\nGENERAL GARRE: -- to invite this kind of\nabuse, which is one of the contextual factors that the\nCommission looked at, along with the extremely shocking\nand graphic nature of using this language at 9:00 p.m.\non an eastern night.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you didn't fine them,\nanyway, did you?\nGENERAL GARRE: We did not fine them because\nwe exercised restraint in making -- in attempting to\nmake clear that the FCC going forward was going to\nconsider isolated --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you had gone from\nPacifica until 2004 with a different policy, where this\nkind of thing would have been okay?\nGENERAL GARRE: We had gone from Pacifica\nuntil 1987, approximately, in the Action for Children's\nTelevision case, where the Commission determined that\nthat approach limited only to the seven dirty words in\nPacifica was unduly narrow and inconsistent with its\nenforcement responsibilities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Remind me about that,\nbecause there was -- the statement that the networks\ndon't do this at all at the time of Action for\nChildren's Television, the fight was, was it going to be\nfrom midnight 'til whatever it was. The networks wanted\nmore hours for adult viewing. They said the only hours\nthat the Commission gave them were hours when most\neverybody is asleep.\nGENERAL GARRE: But I don't -- my\nunderstanding was that was not pertaining to use of the\nF-Word. The networks' policies are at 86 to 88a, the\npetition appendix, and described there. The D.C.\nCircuit found with respect to that change in position\nthat the Commission had supplied an adequate explanation\nunder the APA simply by saying that its prior practice,\nenforcement practice, was unduly narrow and not\nconsistent with its enforcement responsibility.\nWe think that the even more detailed\nexplanation here clearly satisfies the APA standard that\napplied to the Commission's change in position.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe I shouldn't ask\nthis, but is there ever appropriate for the Commission\nto take into consideration at all the question whether\nthe particular remark was really hilarious, very, very\nfunny? Some of these things --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you can't help but\nlaugh at. Is that -- is that a proper consideration, do\nyou think?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes, insofar as the\nCommission takes into account whether it's shocking,\ntitillating, pandering --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's funny. I mean,\nbawdy jokes are okay if they are really good.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, my point is that we\nwill take it into account, but I think you can recognize\nthe potentially greater harmful impact on children where\nyou have celebrities using particularly graphic, vulgar,\nexplicit, indecent language as part of the comedic\nroutine during a show that children are comprising a\nsubstantial part of the viewing audience.\nAnd that is one of the factors that is\nappropriate under this Court's decision in Pacifica and\nthe Commission's policy to take into account the time of\nday and the viewing audience.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you review me to one\nthing in the record if it's there, or just tell me. I\ndid find an explanation for the agency deciding that\n\"fleeting\" is not going to be an automatic exemption.\nThey've talked about that.\nWhat I didn't find is an explanation for a\nsecond thing, which had to do with their first prong of\ntheir former test, and that was the distinction that\nused to be made between using these words as swear words\nand using them as descriptive words. Now that, I think,\nshowed up in their former policy because they said if\nthey were used as a swear word we are not going to go\nafter them, at least not immediately. So that had to do\nwith prong 1, not prong 2.\nGENERAL GARRE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is there an explanation\nwhy they made that change?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, prong 1 hasn't\nchanged, Justice Breyer, since the time --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It hasn't?\nGENERAL GARRE: -- of Pacifica. It has not.\nIt's the same explanation, whether descriptions or\ndepictions of sexual or excretorial organs or\nactivities, the same definition before the Court in\nPacifica.\nAnd as the Pacifica monologue makes clear,\nthere were many both literal and non-literal uses of the\nF-Word and S-Word and other words in that monologue.\nSo, I think the Commission's position is this kind of\nlanguage has always been indecent, which is -- what has\nchanged is it's now going to consider enforcement action\nwhen is it's used in an isolated basis on a context-\nbased approach.\nIf I can reserve --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask one\nquestion? It's about the bottom line of your brief.\nThis whole argument has an air of really futility,\nbecause the Second Circuit more than tipped its hand\nwhen it said: And even as they gave a reasoned\nexplanation, we have grave doubts whether this would be\nconstitutional.\nYou suggested in your brief a remand for\nbriefing and a hearing in the Second Circuit on the\nconstitutional issue. So, is there a way that we can\nsay, well, really, this issue that's before us now is\nignoring the big elephant in the rule, room; we have to\nget to that anyway?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, that approach would be\nconsistent with this Court not deciding issues that\nhaven't been decided below and the general practice of\nconstitutional avoidance. Now, the Second Circuit at\nthree different places in its decision, on page 2a and\npage 35a, and at the end of its decision, made clear\nthat it was not deciding the constitutional issues.\nJudge Laval who dissented didn't say anything about the\nconstitutional issues. So we certainly want another\ncrack at those issues before the Second Circuit, and\nRespondents after all are not simply asking this Court\nto hold the regulation of isolated expletives is\nunconstitutional, but that any broadcast indecency\nregulation is unconstitutional; and at a minimum before\nthis Court entertains that kind of radical\nconstitutional shift, it ought to have the benefit of a\ncourt of appeals decision which actually decides those\nissues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could that be -- could\nthat be done without deciding this APA or are we forced\nto decide that?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we think the Court is\nforced to decide that because that's the basis that the\ncourt of appeals has invalidated the Commission's\naction. The Court should reject that decision which is\nincorrect under the APA and send it back for\nconsideration of the networks' other arguments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nGarre.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think I would like to start with\nJustice Scalia's narrowest question in terms of the\neasiest way to resolve this case, which is did the FCC\nin its remand order in fact recognize that it had made a\nchange in policy and therefore dealt forthrightly with\nthe fact that it had made a change in policy. While it\nis true that the Second Circuit was prepared to accept\nthe idea that the Commission had changed, the reality is\nyou will read that opinion without any ability to\ndiscern that. And the need --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't\nthe ability to discern it come from the reasons given\nfor not assessing fines? They said: We are not\nassessing fines. This is something new, and this is in\neffect a warning to everybody that things have changed.\nIsn't that a pretty clear indication that they are\nadopting a new policy?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It -- well, that they are in\nfact adopting a new policy, I think that is probably\nright, Justice Souter. I think the problem here is that\nordinarily when you are in fact forthrightly changing\nyour policy it is incumbent upon the agency to say: We\nare changing our policy, we recognize we are changing\nour policy, and here is the explanation for why we are\nchanging our policy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are they -- are they\nsupposed to be more virtuous than courts?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, courts all the\ntime, you know, distinguish prior cases by saying,\n\"well, you know, it was dictum, or we didn't really hold\nthat and whatnot. \" And I read their opinion as somewhat\nthe same -- somewhat the same thing. They acknowledge\nat the end, and that's why they didn't impose a fine,\nthat although this, you know, nothing that they had done\nup till now -- although their staff had -- would have\nmisled anybody; still and all, it wasn't all that clear,\nand therefore we won't impose a fine. It seems to me --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The only thing that's\nstrikingly different about that, Justice Scalia, is they\nare very express in dealing with issue in the Golden\nGlobes order, which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- General Garre specifically\nidentifies. It's interesting, when you say where is it\nin the order under review when they say they are going\nto do that, he says look in paragraph 12 of the Golden\nGlobes order. And Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right:\nthis case came to the Second Circuit; the Commission\nsaid No, send it back; give us a full opportunity to\nexplain exactly what we are doing. Thy take it back and\nthey come in and they don't deal with this issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- it was also, they\nsaid, you know, we sort of made this change without\ngetting comments from the affected parties.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That was part of it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give us a chance to receive\ncomments and then -- and then explain.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And then provide a final\nreviewable order from the Commission, presumably that\ndefends in all respects that decision. But as I say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What the Commission\nsaid is that the prior decisions or guidance was\nseriously flawed and we reaffirmed that it was\nappropriate to disavow it.\nIt seems to me that is recognizing a change\nand rejecting it. It's at page 82a.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. All -- all I am\nsuggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that there is equally\nan opposite language in which the Commission -- and the\nSecond Circuit acknowledged this, too -- in which the\nCommission seems to back off whether or not it thinks it\nhas made a change in this particular order. And it\nseems unreliable --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to\nbe the same question that I asked your friend: does it\nmatter? Don't we look at the Commission's order and\ndetermine whether it's a reasonable explanation, whether\nthey view it as a change or not? It seems to me that\nthey kind of said you can view it as a change because\nthe staff had these decisions, and there was dicta; or\nit's not a change. But the point -- important point is\nwhether or not they provided a reasonable explanation\nfor their current position.\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court said in State Farm\nthat when an agency changes its position it is incumbent\nupon the agency to provide more of an explanation in\nthat context than -- than if it were adopting the\nposition in the first instance. So I think yes, if\nthere is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it says in\nState Farm -- what it says in State Farm is that an\nagency's view of what is in the public interest may\nchange either with or without a change in circumstances.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason there is\na change is they looked at it and they decided it was\nwrong.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, I -- I think it\n-- we wouldn't be having this debate if the Commission\nhad simply dealt with this issue in the same forthright\nfashion that it did with respect to the Golden Globes\norder. But even if the Court accepts the idea that\nthere is a change, it seems to me quite clear that the\nCommission has not even remotely satisfied its -- its\nobligation to demonstrate that that change is not\narbitrary and capricious. And I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree it's\nenough of a justification for the change that they think\nthe other policy was wrong? They don't have to say\ncircumstances have changed, the facts are different;\nit's enough to say, \"well, whatever the Commission used\nto thing, we think differently\"?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And then explain why.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then explain\nwhy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And that goes into what I\nthink is the next point that I would like to make which\nis the answer to the Justice Breyer's question, which is\nwhere in the opinion does the Commission explain the\nchange in position with respect to the -- to the first\nprong of the indecency standard, which is whether or not\nthese words inherently mean either sexual or excretory\nactivities; and there, it seems to me, there is a --\nwhether there is a change or not, the reality is that\nfrom 1978 until 2004 this kind of language was used\nroutinely, without the Commission remotely suggesting\nthat every time it was used, it necessarily had a\nparticular meaning. And then suddenly in 2004, this\nlanguage has changed its tone completely, and there is\nno explanation for what is different or what is the\nreason for adopting that particular view. The fact is\nthat the reading of that is so fundamentally at odds\nwith the way the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They said that. They gave\nthe reason for their current belief. They said even\nwhen it is used just as a swear word or as an expletive,\nthe reason it has its impact is precisely because it\nrefers to these excretory or sexual activities; that's\nwhat -- that's what gives -- gives it its zing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court expressly said in\nCohen v California, in talking about exactly the same\nword, that it cannot plausibly be maintained that this\nvulgar allusion would conjure up such -- up such psychic\nstimulation. And if the Court would say that in 1970,\nit applies with even more force in 2008.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not the\nCommission's position. The Commission's position here\nis not when these words were used, people necessarily\nthought of a literal meaning; instead, its position is\nthat the reason these words shocked is because of its\nassociation with the literal meaning. That's a\ndifferent question than what was being addressed in\nCohen.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, all that Cohen says is\nthat you cannot immediately jump -- you -- it wouldn't\neven remotely strike you that the reason the language is\nbeing used is for its particular sexual meaning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why -- why do\nyou think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or\nforce?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The same reason the S-Word\ndoes; it's because in some circles it is inappropriate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because it is\nassociated with sexual or excretory activity. That's\nwhat gives it its -- its force.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, I -- to say that, I\nsuppose you can say it, but I don't understand on what\nbasis. There is no empirical support for that. There's\nno --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there is.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- anything in the record\nthat remotely suggests that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't use golly waddles in\n-- instead of the F-Word.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: People use all kinds of\neuphemisms for it, and nobody blinks about it. The\npoint is -- is that for 20-some years the Commission\ndidn't draw that inference, didn't reach that conclusion\nand nothing has changed over those 20-some years.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, one thing has\nchanged. One thing has changed, I think, from the\nrecord. And let me ask you whether if the Commission\nhad given this explanation it would in your judgment\nsatisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard?\nWhat if the Commission said, you know, our\ntouchstone under prong 1 is community broadcast\nstandards. And we have assumed over the years that\npeople really didn't get too exercised by the usage we\nhave permitted. But we are now getting all this mail\nfrom people who are very angry about it, and they find\nit extremely offensive. And therefore, I guess our\nprior community broadcast standards were wrong. We\nweren't taking into consideration the way people\nactually felt. Now we know how they felt, because of\nthe mail we are getting and we are changing our policy\nfor that reason.\nLeaving aside the Constitutional sufficiency\nof that, in the matter of arbitrary and capricious\nstandards, would it satisfy it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it probably would, if\nall you are doing is looking at just the sort of raw\nAdministrative Procedure Act standard, as it would\nnormally apply to non-content.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the raw APA standard\nissue is what we've got here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I don't think\nthat's a fair way to -- to look at this case. Because I\ndon't see how you can -- it seems to me a completely\nartificial inquiry to look at this as you're regulating\nthe price of oil going through a pipeline. At the end\nof the day you are regulating the content of speech, and\ntherefore the First Amendment ought to inform\neverybody's assessment of what can the Commission do as\nit moves --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: In a more content-restrictive\nway.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's the case, then\nthe concept of constitutional avoidance is -- is somehow\nout of this case and similar First Amendment cases,\nbecause we are always going to -- and I -- when you say\nyou really cannot separate that precisely, we were\nalways going to be getting into the constitutional\nissue, either expressly because we accept your view or\ncovertly because we said, boy, we know what's around the\ncorner. And so, if --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that would only be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we accept your\nargument, we have to change the constitutional avoidance\ndoctrine.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think that's\nexactly right, Justice Souter, because the\nconstitutional avoidance doctrine is not going to be\nmuch of a problem obviously unless there is a grave\nconstitutional threat. So, it's not every assertion of\nthe existence of a constitutional issue that suddenly\ntriggers withdrawal.\nWhen you are dealing in this area, which is\ncontent regulation and restriction on the basis of\ncontent, it seems to me that's inherently a First\nAmendment problem. And when you are in that world, then\nit seems to me the agency, even in the APA context, has\nmore of a responsibility, or at least the Court should\nsay it has more of a responsibility to explain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought we've held\nthat the Court can't engage in such expansion of and\nadditions to the Administrative Procedure Act. I\nthought that was --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the Administrative\nProcedure Act expressly says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- one of our landmark\ndecisions that what it says, it says, and we cannot add\nadditional procedures. You are suggesting we add an\nadditional procedure that when it deals with speech, the\nexplanation has to be really good.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not just --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The Administrative Procedure\nAct also says \"not in accordance with law,\" which also\nrefers to other statutes and obviously the Constitution.\nSo, it's not as though I am asking you to add more to\nwhat the -- to the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are asking for a higher\nstandard than the APA --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I am asking for a higher\nstandard under the APA because we are talking about\ncontent-based restrictions on free speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\nconsistent with Vermont Yankee?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because it was not talking\nabout restrictions on speech, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you are saying\nthat we add to the APA when we are dealing with a\nparticular area. Which of our cases --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which of our cases\nsupports that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court hasn't had to hold\nthat in any particular context, but the reality is, as a\nlogical matter, if you are thinking about -- you know,\nthere is an -- a restriction on \"in accordance with\nlaw.\" The First Amendment is obviously with law, so you\nhave that limitation. And then you have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe sometime\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: And in order to avoid those\nissues --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to be in a\nposition to argue your constitutional issue, but we\ncan't assume that you are right on the Constitution in\napplying the APA.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All I'm saying is that it\nseems to me a remarkably artificial inquiry, to look at\nthis as if you are regulating the price of oil going\nthrough, to a pipeline as opposed to what you are\ntalking about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have complained\nto the lower court about that. You should have said,\nplease don't decide this on the APA issue. This is a\nFirst Amendment case. You should reach the\nconstitutional issue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you went on the APA\nissue, and then you come up here and say: I don't want\nto -- I don't want to discuss the APA; I want to\ndiscuss, you know, the First Amendment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Scalia, I am\nperfectly content to talk about the APA, because at the\nend of the day, the APA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The APA simpliciter; not\nthe APA, you know --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I like the more complicated\nversion, but I am happy to deal with the simpliciter one\nas well.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the reality that goes\nback to Justice Breyer's question, at the end of the day\nthe important part of this is what explains this\nfundamental shift.\nNow, I think Justice Souter, you know, has\nprobably made a respectable argument on APA grounds.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Thank you. Thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But unfortunately that's not\nthe position that the FCC took.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He does good stuff now and\nthen.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I have nothing but the\nhighest regard for him.\nBut the other -- the other part of this case\nthat seems to have gotten lost track of is that this is\nnot a statute that -- that the Commission has the\nresponsibility to enforce. This is a criminal statute.\nThis is section 1464. And through section 503, the\nCommission doesn't have broad-based discretion to define\nfor itself these terms. The Commission has to decide\nwhat is indecent within the meaning of a Federal\ncriminal statute, which means we are entitled to the\nrule of lenity, which means we are entitled to an\ninterpretation of that first prong which, in dealing\nwith indecency, says that it has to describe or depict\nsexual activity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you talk\nabout the rule of lenity, I mean, the point is that this\nchange -- if there is a change in policy or whether it's\nadequately explained -- simply gets you in the door.\nThey say then, once you are there, we just look at all\nof the circumstances and the context. So, we don't --\nit seems to me in their enforcement decisions, their\ndecision not to impose sanctions, their decision not to\nhave this count against you in future proceedings, they\nare being very lenient.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, they are being lenient\nin one sense. I think you have to step back,\nMr. Chief Justice, and recognize what the -- what we've\ngot here. We are talking about an extraordinary in\nterrorem regime that the FCC has created. And I would\ncommend to you all the amicus briefs from the NAB, from\nthe former FCC officials, and from others who describe\nin exquisite detail the chilling effect that this\nparticular scheme may have.\nTo be sure, you know, Fox isn't being\nimmediately penalized by this, but to go back to\nJustice Breyer's question of General Garre, what he said\n-- you know, does everybody have everything on tape and\ndelaying? No, of course not. And why not? Because it\nmay be one thing for Fox to be able to put a show like\nthis on a delayed basis, but if you are dealing with a\nlocal television station that is just getting by\nhand-to-mouth, and they want to televise a football\ngame, and in the middle of that football game some\nstudent decides to express himself in ways that\nnobody anticipated --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this is where\nthe context comes in. At least with impressionable\nchildren, that's dramatically different from saying here\nis an awards show, here is a celebrity, I want to listen\nto what they are going to say because I listen to their\nmusic, and he comes out with that, as opposed to a\nfootball. They know that, you know, somebody says a bad\nword in the middle of the interview. The context makes\nall the difference in the world.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure that -- I\nmean, I don't remember the FCC being in a position to\ndescribe how children are able to perceive one set of\nuses of the word as opposed to another set of uses of\nthe word. But what I think this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They perceive that.\nThey know. I mean, it's one thing to use the word in,\nsay, Saving Private Ryan, when your arm gets blown off.\nIt's another thing to do it when you are standing up at\nan awards ceremony.\nMR. PHILLIPS: You can't seriously believe\nthat the average nine-year-old, first of all, who is\nprobably more horrified by the arm being blown off to\nbegin with, but putting that aside, you -- it cannot\npossibly be that the child has more of a reaction to\nthat word in that context than if a young high school\nfootball player is running down the field screaming a\nparticular expletive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- the young\nfootball player is not a celebrity that they follow.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The young high school player\nactually might be more of a celebrity in some\ncommunities than -- at least than where I live, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The point is whether\nthey are or not is the contextual determination that the\nFCC can undertake. All they are saying is that just\nbecause it's used once doesn't mean you are out of the\n-- out of the woods altogether. Let's look at it, and\nif it turns out there's no -- I mean, this is the point\nthey make, that in one context, it's completely\ngratuitous; in the other context, it's not.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the problem is,\nMr. Chief Justice, once you open the door, then you end\nup with all of the vagueness and overbreadth problems\nthat are inherent in this regime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These arguments apply not\njust to the isolated, once-upon-a-time use, but even to\ncontinued use. You could say the same thing about just\nfilling a program with these expletives, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, you could say\nthe same thing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- but we're not saying the\nsame thing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not, I suppose, what\nyou are arguing against here, is it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, because the point we are\nmaking here is that we haven't asked this Court to\nrevisit Pacifica. And the point is that when you move\naway from Pacifica, which is the verbal shock treatment\nformulation, and say, you know, that's perfectly\nconsistent with the First Amendment and with everything\nthat agency decisionmaking requires, and say that's all\nright -- when you shift from that, which is an enormous\nswitchover, and go into fleeting expletives, then it's a\nfundamental -- all we're saying is that's a\nfundamentally different issue and that implicates more\nserious First Amendment issues, because everybody knows\nwhat is something that is verbal shock treatment or at\nleast we know how to stay pretty far away from it;\nwhereas, if I say every fleeting expletive potentially\nexposes every broadcaster to $325,000 fines made solely\nat the discretion of five individuals, unelected, that\nimpresses me, Your Honors, as simply an inappropriate\nproblem, and one that just follows naturally,\nMr. Chief Justice, from saying, well, all we are going\nto do is open the door. Because once you open the door,\nit is clearly a Pandora's box we are talking about.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why do your\nclients not use these words between 10:00 p.m. and\n6:00 a.m.?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because it affects audience\nshare. There are some people --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you think it\naffects audience share?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because some people are\noffended it; not the whole community. There are\nprobably a lot of people who would actually prefer to\nhave more of it. But some --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you can take that\ninto consideration, why can't the FCC make the same\ndetermination, that there may be some people offended by\nthis, and if there are some people, as part of our\nstatutory responsibility, we are going to look at it.\nNot that they automatically impose --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that's a heckler's veto.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not that they\nautomatically impose a sanction, but that they're going\nto look at it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, that's a\nheckler's veto, and there have been long holdings in\nthis Court that suggest simply pandering to one small\nsegment of the population is no way to enforce First\nAmendment rights. So that's -- I mean, that's my\nprimary answer to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There goes Pacifica.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think there goes\nPacifica, because Pacifica was only one person --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a heckler's\nveto?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. What --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if people like, you\nknow, going on and on with expletives and offensive\nwords? Are those of us who are offended by that\nhecklers and you can't take our positions into account\nbecause you're giving effect to a heckler? I mean -- I\ndon't think so.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the problem is that the\nChief Justice's question was: Why do we have a 24-hour\nrule.\nAnd the answer is: It's one thing for us to\nvoluntarily assume that. I think it is a mistake, and I\ndon't know that -- and I don't think -- I didn't read\nanything in the Commission's opinion that reflects it.\nBut they say that fact suddenly defines the community\nstandards for purposes of what is indecent and what is\nnot indecent. That simply reflects our own best\njudgment about how to serve our audience.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there is -- if there is\na change in the community standards, does that justify a\nchange in the FCC's policies?\nAnd the second question and the reason I ask\nthat is: Do you think today the community generally is\nmore offended by these words or more tolerant of these\nwords --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- as compared to what\nPacifica was concerned with?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean I -- I believe that\nsociety is significantly more tolerant of these words\ntoday than it was in -- 30 years ago.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think your clients\nhave had anything to do with that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: In -- in the scheme of\nthings, probably very, very little to do with that\ncompared to the way the language is used. Go to a\nbaseball game, Justice Scalia. You hear these words\nevery -- every time you go to a ballgame.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You do, indeed, but you\ndon't have them presented as something that is -- is\nnormal in polite company, which is what happens when it\ncomes out in -- in television shows. This is a\ncoarsening of manners that is -- that is produced by --\nby the shows. So I am -- you know, I -- I am not\npersuaded by the argument that people are more\naccustomed to hearing these words than they were in the\npast.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the -- I mean I think\nwhat Justice Stevens is getting at is: What has changed\nover the last 30 years? And if anything has changed, it\nwould be exactly the opposite, which is they are going\nto be more and more tolerant of this language; not that\nthey are less tolerant of this language. And,\ntherefore, there is even less reason for the Commission\nto have taken the position that it did in this\nparticular context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More tolerant or more used\nto hearing it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think both.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Candidly, I think there is\na difference.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I am not saying there\nis not a difference, but I am suggesting that there are\n-- that the -- that the change over time has -- has made\nthis less of a compelling argument than it would have\nbeen, at least in my judgment, in -- in 1978.\nI would like to make a couple of different,\nadditional points. Another thing that has changed since\n1978 is that there is much more opportunity for parents\nto control access for their children because of the V-\nclip. That's available.\nSecond, in terms of this effort to try to\nlessen the coarsening of America --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that works.\nI haven't looked at the statistics on one-parent\nfamilies, working parents, and so forth. Those factors\nboth have to be considered.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, but if you put in a\nV-chip, it doesn't matter whether your parents are\nworking or not. The truth is if you had had a V-chip\nfor the 2003 version of this, which would have said PGL,\nwhich is for language, children couldn't have gotten on\nthere whether the parents were at home or not. The\nV-chip is a usable and feasible technology and is a less\nrestrictive alternative than the one that we have on the\n-- on the table under these particular circumstances.\nThe -- I wanted to go back to the -- to the\nstatute, the fact that this is a criminal statute.\nAgain, the Commission is not arguing here for broad --\nrecognizing, or accepting, or arguing for, that they\nhave a broad delegation of authority. They don't have\nthe authority to decide what indecency is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you were -- you were\npursuing the practical thing about the tapes, and so\nforth, when you got on to a different subject, which was\nthe -- the nature of the program. I just wanted to be\ncertain you are finished with what you wanted to say\nthere. I -- because I am interested in the practical\nquestion of: Do all the stations have tapes? And leave\nsports events out of it, and leave news out of it. Are\nthere other events that these small stations might want\nto cover that don't have the tape or that now don't use\nthe tape; anything else you want to say about that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am interested in the\npractical problem as part of this. Where do I look to\nfind out some facts?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the NAB amicus brief\nactually has a pretty good description of a variety of\ndifferent instances in which this has -- has occurred.\nAnd, of course, the NAB represents obviously the large\nnetworks but also all of the individual stations. And\nthat, to me at least, makes a compelling argument that\nyou -- you cannot simply have one rule that says: Let's\njust impose additional costs on everybody. Because the\nanswer to that is that those stations will simply refuse\nto broadcast.\nAnd to me the best illustration of it, and\nthe one that the public interest, I would hope, would\ncommand or demand the Court take account of, is the\nVermont public station that refused to broadcast a\ndebate or -- or allow a number of Senatorial candidates\nto participate in a debate because that candidate had\nused expletives in a previous public forum, and,\ntherefore, didn't think it could allow that broadcast\nand take that risk because it can't afford to have the\ntape-delayed technology that you are talking about.\nAnd -- and that to me is the quintessential\nexample. But there are loads of them, and it's just\ngoing to get worse once you decide to get past the\nnotion that a fleeting expletive, no matter how it\narises, requires to you justify it.\nBecause we went from a system that said: We\nwill, in general, never condemn fleeting expletives to\nthe system that exists now, which is we routinely\ncondemn them unless we think its okay. And that's a\nsystem, it seems to me, this Court ought not to\ncountenance. It is embedded in the Second Circuit's\ndecision.\nThe Court should affirm that decision and\nvacate back to the Commission so that it can go forward\n-- or to remand back to the Commission so it can do the\nbest it can to try to come up with a justification that\nsatisfies both the APA and the First Amendment that it\nhas not done so far.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, this --\nthis is similar to the question that I asked General\nGarre. The Commission asked for a remand so it could\nprovide a reasoned explanation. But you had or your\nclients had -- in their complaint they made an APA claim\nas well as a First Amendment claim, didn't they?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, we did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean it wasn't a complaint.\nActually, it was -- it was a petition for review --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Correct.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- going right to the Second\nCircuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: So it doesn't have the same\nbill of particulars that you might otherwise have.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You could have just done\nthe First Amendment, but you -- you did put the APA into\nit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We --\nwe do believe that the Commission changed its position,\nand -- and, again, we had to file a separate petition\nfor review from the remand order over and above the\npetition for review we filed from the first order.\nSo, you know, we took into account this\nassessment in saying we don't think the agency had\nadequately justified its change in position.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,\nMr. Phillips? I guess in the -- in the last analysis we\nare trying to decide what the word \"indecent\" means.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do you think that the\nword \"indecent\" can have -- that -- that a fleeting\nexpletive could be not indecent, but the same words\ncould be indecent if they are repeated several times?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think it -- at least to me\nit's hard. I don't think so, but I -- I can understand\nthat Pacifica could be read that way, although in\npacifica, itself, George Carlin does, in fact, use the\nfleeting expletive in an explicitly sexual way at -- at\ntimes.\nBut I -- I think the hardest case, candidly,\nis the situation where you have a string of expletives,\nall of which are clearly not designed to reflect\nanything about sexual activity and what you do in that\nsituation. That is the hardest case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I -- I am not --\nnot sure I make my question as clear as I should. If we\nare trying to define the term \"indecent\" --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- does the -- does the\nnumber of times the word is used in a particular context\nmake a difference in the definition?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I apologize. I didn't -- I\nmisunderstood your question. No, I don't think so. I\nthink the question -- the first prong of the indecency\ninquiry is whether or not the particular language used\ndoes, in fact, describe or depict sexual or excretory\nactivities or organs. And that's the No. 1 inquiry.\nAnd I don't think the number of times in which you use\nit affects the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As a matter of statutory\ndefinition, if a particular word can describe those\nactivities, it is equally indecent if used for a\ndifferent purpose?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I would have thought\nthat, since you were dealing with a statute that is --\nthat imposes criminal sanctions, that if you have those\ntwo alternative interpretions available, you have to\nchoose the one that is more favorable to the defendant.\nAnd, therefore, you would -- you would say that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- would not be indecent.\nThat is the interpretation --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I am sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- you should accept.\nLet's say because one interpretation of an ambiguous\nword would not be indecent, you are saying the rule of\nlenity in that sort of approach would require in a\ncriminal case to just adopt that -- that definition?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That would be my argument,\nyes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- I mean you are\njust -- correct me if I am wrong, but your colloquy with\nJustice Stevens sort of is a way of phrasing the issue\nin the case. Because you are saying, I think, prior to\nthis -- prior to the change, the Commission interpreted\n\"indecency\" in terms of indecent practice. And what the\nCommission is now doing is defining \"indecency\" in terms\nof the meaning of a word. It's -- it's relatively going\nfrom saying indecency is a practice, i.e., a repetition\nof certain kinds of words, to saying \"indecency\" is --\nis the use of any word which is itself indecent.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I agree with that\ncompletely, Justice Souter. No. That is exactly how\nyou can characterize it. I mean it may not be the\nprecise verbal formulation we used, but, candidly, that\nis it and essentially the way Judge Lebal looked at it.\nAnd he just said at the end of the day, because I have\nto defer to the agency, I am going to let them have that\ninterpretation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that is not the\nappropriate approach.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask about deferring\nthere. You seem to be suggesting that since there is a\ncriminal penalty for a violation of this statute, the\nagency has no role in -- in defining what -- what the\nterms of the statute mean.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, the language\nof the statute itself would suggest that, because the\nstatute says that the Commission may find violate -- may\nimpose certain enforcement actions for people who\nviolate section 1464. That, of course, is a criminal\nstatute.\nTherefore, it is not a statute that has been\ndelegated to the agency's broad discretion to decide\nwhat falls within that language. It is within the\nagency's discretion to choose a penalty that, in fact,\nenforces that criminal dictate.\nAnd to go back to Justice Stevens's\nposition -- I shouldn't give it as your position, it is\nmy position -- but the point, I think, we were\ndiscussing, if you have a choice of two ways to read\nindecency, you have to read it in a way more favorable\nto the defendant, that precludes the approach that the\ngovernment has taken in this particular case.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor, I would reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nGeneral Garre you have two minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nFirst, Justice Scalia, it's on page 82-A of\nthe petition appendix where the Commission acknowledges\nthe change in the order at issue in this case.\nJustice Breyer, going back to your question\nabout whether the Commission's definition of indecency\nhas changed, it is not and that is made clear at page\n73-A of the petition appendix where the Commission says,\nquote, a long line of precedence indicates that the use\nof the F-Word for emphasis or as an intensifier comes\nwithin the subject matter scope of our indecency\ndefinition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It explained -- I mean, the\nchange I saw was that previously the use of these words\nas a swear was treated differently from the use of these\nwords as a description. And that after the event, it's\nnot treated differently.\nGENERAL GARRE: It explains on page 74 why\nthe Commission has determined that these words are\nindecent. The Commission has only treated those literal\nuses of these words as potentially indecent under its\ncontextual analysis.\nWe think that Justice Ginsburg's decision\nfor the D.C. Circuit in the Action for Children's\nTelevision case provides a road map for resolving this\ncase, where the Court separately addressed the APA\nquestion of whether the agency had provided a reasonable\nexplanation and then separated out the constitutional\nissues, which this Court need not address.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask one question\nthat just occurred to me? Do you think the use of the\nword dung, D-U-N-G, would be indecent?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think it would probably\nqualify under the subject matter definition, but it\nprobably wouldn't be patently offensive under community\nstandards for broadcasting.\nThe one thing that can't be disputed -- in\nthis case is that the F-Word is patently offensive under\ncommunity standards for the broadcast medium. This\nCourt has reversed the decision below on the APA\nquestion presented and remand the case for consideration\nunder --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have the F-Word in\nthere too, and even Judge Leval says he didn't\nunderstand why that word should be on the list.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we certainly think\nthat under community standards that that word is\npatently offensive as well. And certainly, but we think\nthat the F-Word itself is clearly patently offensive.\nWe think that the S-Word is patently offensive. This\nCourt did so -- we think had that view in the Pacifica\ncase as well, because that, of course, is one of the\nseven dirty words at issue in that case.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
