        "content": "(11:00 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett.\nMr. Salvatore.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SALVATORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThere are three reasons why this Court\nshould reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on\ncollectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum\nselection clauses.\nFirst, the Second Circuit ignored section\n(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which\nCongress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their\nemployees over anything germane to the working\nenvironment, including methods of workplace dispute\nresolution.\nThe forum in which an ADEA claim is heard\nfalls squarely in that authority. Indeed, forbidding\nunions from bargaining about the procedural right to an\narbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the\nlabor law permitting employers to bypass the union and\ndeal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's\nnational labor policy.\nSecond, the Second Circuit failed to\nconsider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace\narbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301.\nThird, the Second Circuit erroneously and\nexclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver.\nGardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not\nabout enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salvatore, you take the\nposition that the only thing that is at stake here is\nsimply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum.\nWhat do you -- what do you say to the\nargument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the\ncollective bargaining agreement the employee is subject\nnot merely to the right of the union to choose the\narbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim\nat all? What -- what is your answer to that?\nMR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, in -- in our\ncollective bargaining agreement, the collective\nbargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the\nemployee tenders the claim to the union. And in the\nmajority of cases the -- the employee and the union's\ninterests will be aligned, and the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here it wasn't.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. What -- what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here we are dealing with\nclaims that the union said: Sorry, we are not going to\nprocess these claims because we have some tension since\nthe younger workers that replaced you, we also represent\nthem.\nSo you are proposing, as far as I understand\nit, a situation where these workers would have no\nindividual right at all if the union says: We -- we\nwon't represent you.\nMR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor. The -- the\nclause requires all claims to be arbitrated, and \"all\nclaims\" means that the individuals then have to go to\narbitration with their private counsel in this case and\n-- and have their claims heard in the arbitral forum.\nSo that no one is denying --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does -- where does\nthe contract say anything about the -- the individual\nsucceeding to whatever arrangement there is between the\nunion and the employer?\nMR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, I'm looking at\nthe petition appendix.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that only --\nonly the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an\nindividual.\nMR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor. That's --\nthat's not the -- the way the contract reads. I'm\nlooking at the petition appendix page 48a, which is the\n\"no discrimination\" clause.\nAnd just -- just as a quick prelude to --\nbefore I -- I go through that language, I just want to\n-- to note that this argument that these employees were\nnot bound to go individually to arbitration was never\nraised below.\nThe Second Circuit did not consider it.\nIndeed, the Second Circuit found that the clause covered\nthese employees, and -- and this only came up in the\nRespondents' brief in this Court after cert was granted,\nthe red brief.\nSo that this -- this argument is one that\nthe factual premises for were never considered below in\nthe district court or in -- in the court of appeals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I'm clear --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't -- I don't wish to\ndelay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the\ndecision we have to make, don't we have to have in the\nbackground the consideration of the -- that the -- the\npotentiality that the union might do just what it did\nhere, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our\ndecision on the question that you are presenting.\nNow, whether or not it's properly raised\nhere, I do agree with you it comes rather late. But\nisn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?\nMR. SALVATORE: Yes, Your Honor. And --\nand, indeed, the collective bargaining agreements --and\nwe'll look at the language in one second -- are -- are,\nas this Court has recognized, a little more complicated\nto understand than -- than average contracts. You have\nto look at the practice and the custom.\nThe practice here for this union has been to\nturn over claims to the individuals. We've had this\nclause in place for nine years. The New York courts\nhave enforced it repeatedly and -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this included in the\nquestion presented anyway?\nMR. SALVATORE: It was -- it was not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have anything to do\nwith the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?\nMR. SALVATORE: It does not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Second Circuit simply\nsaid you could not deprive an individual of the right to\na court trial.\nMR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue is whether --\nnow, if -- if we held that you can require the\nindividual to go to arbitration, in some later case we\ncould confront the question of whether, if the union is\nin exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the\nindividual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal,\nthat would invalidate it.\nBut it has nothing to do with the question\npresented: Is an arbitration clause which clearly and\nunmistakably waives the union member's right to a\njudicial forum enforceable.\nMR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nThat is my argument with respect to why this does not\nneed to be taken up now.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I hate to get into\nthis, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the\nunion and -- and the employees.\nMR. SALVATORE: There is no factual record,\nYour Honor, for it in the record at all. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there is at least\nsome. The collective bargaining agreement is in here.\nAnd if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to\ndecide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit\nwas correct.\nThe question is posed in generalities, but\nwe are not going to decide the general question in total\nignorance of this case. And in this case we've got the\nparticular collective bargaining agreement in front of\nus, and you started to answer the question that -- that\nI and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the \"no\ndiscrimination\" clause.\nMR. SALVATORE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And will -- will you go on\nto that?\nMR. SALVATORE: I will. The clause is -- I\nam looking at petition appendix 48a, the \"no\ndiscrimination\" clause. This is the -- the clause at\nissue in this case. It covers any present or future\nemployee. It goes on to state the -- the types of\nprotected characteristics that are covered by this\nclause as well as the -- the relevant statutes\nincorporating statutory law, public law, in the -- in\nthe clause.\nAnd then in the second-to-last sentence five\nlines up from the bottom it states: \"All such claims\nshall be subject to the grievance and arbitration\nprocedure, Articles 5 and 6, as the sole and exclusive\nremedy for violations.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean? Does\nthat mean that they must go to arbitration even if the\nunion decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so\ninsignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?\nMR. SALVATORE: What this means, Justice\nScalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court.\nThey have to go either through the union, as has been\nthe practice here, or the union will turn the claim over\nto them and let them go by themselves.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where did we get this\nphrase -- where do we get the language \"or the union\nwill turn over to them\"? The only thing that I can see\nin here that addresses that is on page 46a. And the --\nthe clause there reads: \"All union claims are brought\nby the union alone, and no individual shall have the\nright to compromise or settle any claim without the\nwritten permission of the union.\"\nThere is -- there is a lot of gray area in\nthat, but the one thing that seems clear is that the\nunion has total control over any claim, including an\narbitration claim.\nAnd that seems to lend some substance to the\n-- to the point made by the other side that if we accept\nyour position here, we are accepting a position not\nnearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural\ndesignation of a forum should be enforced but that, in\nfact, total control over the assertion of a statutory\nFederal right is also being ceded. Now, why doesn't\nthat language from section 46 support that?\nMR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, it does not\nsupport it for the -- for the following reason. The --\nthe section 30 clause on page 48a. The \"no\ndiscrimination\" clause, was added in 1999. It was added\nafter the Court's decision in Wright. It was added to\ncomply with Wright. That's an undisputed fact.\nIt -- it was added as a separate section\nwith a separate arbitration promise because \"all claims\"\nis broader than \"union claims.\" \"Union claims\" was\nsomething that goes back for 75 years, but before we put\nin section 30 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, \"all such\nclaims\" -- \"such claims\" refers among other things to\nthe statutory right.\nMR. SALVATORE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if the statutory right\nis the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement\nand the union has ultimate control of the arbitration\nagreement, then it follows that the union has got\nultimate control over the assertion of the statutory\nright.\nMR. SALVATORE: No, Your Honor, not unless\n-- not if the union turns that over. The employee's\nreading --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where -- where is the\nguarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want\nto touch this, as in this case, that the employee has\nthe right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to\nsue? Where do you find that?\nMR. SALVATORE: Your Honor, that -- that\nright is -- is described from this language, \"all such\nclaims.\" There is another route. What Articles 4, 5,\nand 6 describe is that -- that the -- you must go to the\noffice of the contract arbitrator, and it doesn't\nspecify whether you go with the union or you go by\nyourself.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Has any court decided this\nissue of the interpretation of the collective bargaining\nagreement in this particular.\nMR. SALVATORE: No court has decided this\nvery issue like this, Justice Alito. But what the New\nYork courts have said is in interpreting this clause\nover the last nine years, that they compel the\nindividual union member to go to arbitration when they\nhave brought claims in court in violation of this\nclause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salvatore, I -- I\ndidn't think we took this case to -- to determine the\nspecific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this\nparticular contract, which is not an issue of national\nimportance. Why -- why must we decide the case here?\nCould we not simply decide that the Second\nCircuit was either correct, in which case the case would\nbe over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you\ncannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining\nagreement have the union responsible for arbitration of\nTitle VII claims? Why couldn't we just decide that?\nAnd then if there is any issue of whether\nsuch concession to the union deprives an individual of\neven the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be\ndecided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?\nMR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Second Circuit\ncould look into all of these details.\nMR. SALVATORE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And inquire into the New\nYork law that you're talking about now and that I don't\nrecall being in any of the briefing.\nMR. SALVATORE: Justice Scalia, as cited in\nour briefing, there is a long footnote listing the\ncases. But -- but you're right, the -- the issue here\nreally is can the union agree to this? And that goes to\nCongress's giving the union the power under section 9(a)\nof the National Labor Relations Act to be the exclusive\nbargaining representative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I ask you -- let me ask you\na naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a\nmisunderstanding. But my understanding is that suppose\nyou are -- you are an employee. You believe your\nemployer discriminated against you, say, on gender\ngrounds. You have to go to the EEOC.\nNow, the EEOC looks into it and very often\nwhat they do is they don't really resolve it. They just\ngive you a letter that gives you a right to sue.\nSo here Congress was so worried about this\nkind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you\nknow, won't be the bottom line. People will go there\nand then they have a right to sue later.\nNow, that's how Congress felt about this\nparticular statute. Why would they want the union to be\nthe bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself\nhasn't agreed? I mean, the employee might agree in the\nfirst place. He might say I'm going to take that\nletter, I'm not going to bring my suit. That's up to\nhim or her. But here the employee wants to bring her\nsuit, just like the EEOC letter.\nMR. SALVATORE: Well, Justice Breyer, the\nADEA provides not only a right to go to court after\nyou've gotten your right-to-sue letter or waited 60\ndays, but -- but it also provides multiple, as this\ncourt recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that\nCongress wants to use: Conciliation, persuasion,\nconference --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. That's my point,\nis that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable\neffort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass\nand an employee who is reasonably determined to get to\ncourt probably can do it. It's not definite. The EEOC\ndoesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right\nto sue, but probably can do it.\nAnd if that's a situation where you have\nthis whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is\na parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the\nunion and the employer together to be able to cut that\nright to sue off, at least not very easily.\nMR. SALVATORE: Justice Breyer, you have\ncompeting policies here because you have the policies of\nthe labor laws which say that unions should have a -- a\nbroad portfolio of -- of topics to bargain about. This\nCourt has said that anything germane to the working\nenvironment, dispute resolution mechanisms --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the union could not\nbargain about these anti-discrimination rights. These\nare rights given to individuals by Congress. The union\ncouldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about\ncollective rights, the way it bargains about wages and\nhours and -- and other things. This is, this is not a\nbargainable right. This is a right Congress says you as\nan individual have a right not to be discriminated\nagainst. This is nothing that the union can bargain\nabout.\nMR. SALVATORE: Justice Ginsburg, I agree to\nthe degree we're talking about -- you're talking about\nsubstantive rights. What we are talking about here is a\nprocedural switch. As this Court has approved in\nGilmer, what we are talking about is moving the forum\nfrom the judicial one to the -- to the arbitral one.\nAnd here in the -- the scheme of a collective bargaining\nagreement where arbitration is the preferred remedy and\nhas been used for many, many years very successfully in\nthe -- in the -- by those parties.\nIt's -- it's taking employment arbitration\nand putting it in the collective bargaining context.\nAnd -- and there is, unions do this in many different\nways. Unions bargain about substantive rights. We are\nnot talking about substantive rights here, though. We\nare talking about procedural rights. And the policies\nof the labor laws are served and the policies of the\nADEA and the anti-discrimination statutes are not\ndisserved in any way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salvatore, would you --\nwould you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that\nsays yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union\narbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate\nit the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on\nhis own?\nMR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's the\npractice under this agreement, Your Honor. We would --\nwe would wholeheartedly endorse that -- that rule\nbecause, that's the practice here. And there is -- when\nyou're talking about statutory rights, why would the\nunion want to interfere with the ability of the employee\nto get a forum if their interests are not aligned? This\ngoes to the tension that this Court has -- has\nrecognized in its prior cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that means\nthat if there is z totally frivolous claim and the\nemployer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going\nto arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to\nthen proceed? The employer hasn't gotten very much.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He has got an arbitration\ninstead of a lawsuit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you would -- if you\nwould answer the question. The employer hasn't gotten\nvery --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- very much for the\nbargain.\nMR. SALVATORE: Justice Kennedy, the\nemployer has gotten arbitration and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the hard cases.\nMR. SALVATORE: Well, in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it hasn't got the\nability to have the union help them weed out frivolous\nclaims.\nMR. SALVATORE: Well that's true. The\nunion -- the union wouldn't play that function, except\nthat we have in this industry, the real estate industry\nin New York City, a longstanding relationship that --\nthat goes back decades. And -- and -- so it's a mature\ncollective bargaining arrange -- arrangement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm\nnot sure that employers nationwide would -- would --\nwould accept -- would accept that view.\nMR. SALVATORE: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And again, maybe that's --\nthat's a reason for us not to reach it in this case.\nMR. SALVATORE: Well, one of the issues\nthat -- that Congress allows the bargaining parties to\nfigure out is what the scope of their collective\nbargaining arrangement should be. That's one of the\nhallmarks of the NRLA. So, yes, some collective\nbargaining parties may make that choice, Justice\nKennedy; others may make a different choice.\nWhat is the alternative here? The\nalternative is that employers can bypass the union.\nThey can just go around the union and -- and have\nindividual Gilmer agreements signed up. That's what the\nD.C. Circuit said en banc in -- in -- in the ALPA Pilots\ncase.\nAnd indeed, the -- the union in that case\nwas arguing the position that we are arguing here, that\nthis is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and this is\nright in the union's portfolio of -- of what they should\nbe using to -- to bargain with the employer because it's\na procedural right and there are no substantive outcomes\nthat are diminished in any way whatsoever.\nUnions are deemed trustworthy enough to\nbring lawsuits in the federal courts on behalf of their\nmembers. Under principles of associational standing,\nassociational standing, the members are bound by\ntheir -- their union's actions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And nonmembers, too?\nWhat about the people who -- who are not members of the\nunion, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the\nunion's services in collective bargaining? They would\nbe bound as well? They couldn't --\nMR. SALVATORE: Absolutely, Justice\nGinsburg. The -- the -- the -- and this type of service\nis one of the core functions that an agency payer would\nhave to pay for. The LM2 that 32B, the local, filed\nhere on behalf of 80,000 employees has two agency fee\npayers out of 80,000. So it's not really an issue in\nthis case.\nBut that's what unions are for. When\nCongress makes them the exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative you're -- you're in for it one way or the\nother. You're -- you're -- either you're in or you're\nout. And if you're in, then you have to go along with\nthe -- the -- the entire collective bargaining deal that\nis made --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -- the -- fine.\nI -- I grasp your answer to that. But you\nsaid that the employee would have the absolute right if\nthe union says, \"sorry, for whatever reason we can't\nrepresent you,\" absolute right to that arbitral forum.\nWhat -- who pays then?\nI mean, if the union is in it, then the\nunion and the employer are going to split -- split the\ncost. But what happens when the union drops out and you\nhave the individual and the employer in this arbitral\nforum?\nMR. SALVATORE: In -- in this situation the\nemployer pays. That's the only -- the Office of the\nContract Arbitrator is an -- essentially a mini-\nAmerican Arbitration Association that these parties have\nset up, and the -- the RAB, which is the multi- employer\norganization that represents all the real estate\nemployers in -- in New York, they pay for the\narbitration, because the union in this case has said we\nare not going to pay.\nAs you point out rightly, if the union is\nnot involved, they -- they shouldn't pay. So there is\nno cost to the employee for that arbitration and -- and\nas Justice Edwards said in the D.C. Circuit Kohl case,\nthat -- that that procedure is -- is a fair one, to have\nthe employer pick up the -- the costs given -- given the\n-- the balance between the -- the two of them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salvatore, are you\ngoing to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver\nbefore you're all through?\nMR. SALVATORE: Yes -- yes, Your Honor,\nJustice Stevens. Gardner-Denver is -- is a case, as\nthis Court has described, that -- that didn't involve\nthe enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate. The\nGardner-Denver line of cases, McDonald and Barrentine\nand Gardner-Denver, had the quite different issue as\nthis Court said in Gilmer, of whether a contract-based\nclaim precludes subsequent judicial resolution of a\nstatutory claim; and so that distinguishes the rule.\nBut factually these cases are very different as -- as\nwell.\nMr. Alexander in Alexander v.\nGardner-Denver, the contract there, the collective\nbargaining agreement, had a plain vanilla arbitration\nclause. It didn't have a clause like the one we looked\nat page, petition appendix 48a, that incorporated all\nthe -- the statutes and gave the arbitrator the power to\nsit and -- and to apply those statutes and apply the law\nunder those statutes and apply the remedies that derive\nfrom those statutes. In that case, the arbitrator sat\nas the proctor of the bargain between the collective\nbargaining parties, and didn't have that broad\nauthority, as this Court has -- has recognized.\nAnd -- and we agree that arbitration that --\nthat resolves just a collective bargaining agreement\nclaim should not be dispositive of a statutory claim.\nThey're fish and fowl. So that Gardner-Denver is\ncorrectly decided. Gardner-Denver puts out the rule for\n-- for that situation. This is a different situation\nthat we are talking about.\nAnd -- and here, unlike in Gardner-Denver,\nwhere Mr. Alexander would have had no access to the --\nto have his Title VII claim heard if this Court had\naffirmed the Tenth Circuit, he -- the door to the\ncourthouse would have been shut in that case for\nMr. Alexander -- here we are trying to move to compel\narbitration so that there is a forum, and -- and that\nthese individuals -- these employees --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But not a judicial -- not\na judicial forum.\nMR. SALVATORE: An arbitral forum, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salvatore, would you\njust clarify something for me? I thought that the union\nceded its rights to the employees and said that they\ncould use this collective bargaining agreement's\narbitral regime so long as they paid for it. But you\ntell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer\npays everything.\nMR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's correct.\nThat's the union counsel's affidavit. He was saying he\ndoesn't -- the union doesn't want to pick up the costs,\nJustice Ginsburg, but the collective bargaining\nagreement says there is two payers in the Office of the\nContract Arbitrator, the RAB and the union. If the\nunion is not paying, then the RAB has to pay.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the\nrest of my time for rebuttal, please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Second Circuit's judgment should be\naffirmed for three reasons. First, a collective\nbargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control\nover workers' grievances. Second, unions have inherent\nconflicts of interest with respect to individual\nstatutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions\nlack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual\nworkers' substantive ADEA rights.\nWith respect to the first point, a\ncollective bargaining agreement generally gives the\nunion exclusive control over whether to bring grievances\non behalf of workers and how such grievances are\npursued. In such circumstances -- which is this case,\nthe workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to\narbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to\nsatisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively\nvindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination\nrights.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Under your first point, are\nyou saying it's impossible for there to be a collective\nbargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore\nreads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective\nbargaining agreement which says that the union's -- that\nthe grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done\neither by the union, or if the union declines to pursue\nit, by the individual employee?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, I've looked\ncomprehensively through the cases. We've never found a\ncollective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of\ninterpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case.\nNow, is it theoretically possible that a collective\nbargaining agreement would confer on individuals the\nrights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to\nvindicate that? I would acknowledge it's theoretically\npossible, but it has to be done within the confines of\nwhether there is actual consent by the individual to the\narbitration, whether the individual has control over the\nmechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the\nstructure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates\nthe individual's substantive rights.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But there is nothing in\nFederal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of\na collective bargaining agreement like that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Nothing except this Court's\ncase in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may\nnot bargain away an individual's rights where there\nwould be a conflict between the union's interests and\nthe individual's. Here, because this is a\ndiscrimination claim, unions are often brought as\ndefendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances\nas here, where the union agreed to the conditions that\ngave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by\nthese workers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even in a case in which you\ndon't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of\nargument that we don't have the discrimination issue or\nthe conflict issue. I understood you elsewhere to be\narguing that there had to be the kind of knowing,\nintelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose\na collective bargaining agreement will never include.\nSo I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of\nyour argument that in any -- in any case in which\narbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a\nright to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer --\nthere would have to be, not merely the collective\nbargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the\nemployee to -- to go ahead and do that. Is that right?\nMR. FREDERICK: That -- that's correct. And\nthat's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential\nhere, Justice Souter and Justice Alito. Because in\nGilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be\nsuch individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself,\nand knowing and individual waiver is necessary before\nthe person can waive the substantive ADEA rights. That\nwould need to be part of the hypothetical collective\nbargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice\nAlito.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would that mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Go ahead.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would that mean that the\nemployer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration\nrequirement on employees?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that would follow,\nas that would be a condition of employment that could\nnot be imposed. The airline --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't be\nunilaterally imposing, right? He would say if you're\ngoing to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that\ncould be negotiated theoretically, and with individual\nemployee. And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole\nbenefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't\nhappen. You say, well, the employer has a lot of\nleverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would\nnot -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the\nindividual and the company.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but there are two different points at which the\ncondition of employment arose. I understood the\nquestions on this side to be after the agreement had\ntaken place and the worker was already on the work site.\nUnder your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance\nto the work force and is asked, \"will you sign this,\"\nthere is individual consent in that circumstance. That\nis the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the one thing that's\nuniform throughout in your answer is that the collective\nbargaining agreement alone can never subject the\nemployee to -- to mandatory arbitration?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's -- that's how we read\nthis Court's statutory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is also true -- is that\nalso true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of\nsuit?\nMR. FREDERICK: Sorry. With an ordinary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A tort suit. It says, some\n-- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not\nconcerned with discrimination; we are concerned with\nworkplace safety. Somebody is hurt as a result of\nmachine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate\nnotice or so forth. Is your view the same there?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that those\ncategory of cases do stand in a different position\nbecause there is less of an inherent conflict of\ninterest. The union there --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the union is not going\nto be the Defendant typically in a tort case where the\nemployer is responsible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't this allow\ndiscrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination\nby the employer?\nMR. FREDERICK: It refers to discrimination,\nand as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are\nprovisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are\nspecifically directed at union discrimination. The\nlegislative history of these statutes indicates that\ndiscrimination by unions was one of the concerns\nanimating Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you say section 30\ndoesn't say anything about union discrimination\nparticularly; it just talks about discrimination.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. In fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So you think\nsometimes unions do discriminate?\nMR. FREDERICK: And that's why --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And sometimes\nunions also would rather have the more effective machine\nor sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to\nread the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can\nreplicate anything you might think. We can think of\ntort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and\nemployees on opposite shores, just as we can think of\ndiscrimination suits. Most unions don't want\ndiscrimination. I mean, most of the time. And most\nunions don't want dangerous machines most of the time.\nSo if I decide for you in this case, am I\nalso saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort\nsuits or contract suits or just whether or not the\nworkplace which is made of wood is filled with termites?\nI mean, you know?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think, Justice Breyer,\nthat the discrimination cases do stand in a different\ncategory because of the inherent conflict of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the only reason?\nBecause, in other words, if I think I see no more reason\nwhy a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that\nI see no more reason today why a union would like\ndiscrimination, then I can see a reason why they would\nlike a dangerous machine?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I think that, then I\nshould decide against you?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, no, because there are\ntwo other reasons: The exclusive control over the\nmachinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper.\nI'm not aware of tort suits being subjects\nof collective bargaining, Justice Breyer. Nor am I\naware of cases in which the unions have given up\nindividuals' tort claims in situations, principally\nbecause unions are not the persons against whom such\ntort suits are brought.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but those -- I'm\nsorry.\nThose examples are examples. You're getting\ndown to individual cases. I thought you drew the global\nline in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's\nquestion by saying the -- in the cases that we're\ntalking about here, Congress has passed a statute giving\na specific individual right and that individual right\ncannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in\nviolation of that statute, and that's where we draw the\nglobal line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at\nthe individual situation rather than draw a categorical\nline.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, you would, but the\nprinciples this Court has applied in looking at that\nbroad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be\nsituations in which those principles, where the union is\nserving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person\nto vindicate his individual rights in the tort context,\nto be not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I agree with you, but I\nthink -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's\nmouth --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Very helpful of you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought what he was\ngetting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to\nhave to hold for you in every case in which somebody has\nin effect a tort claim which is subject to an\narbitration clause?\nMR. FREDERICK: And the answer is no. I\nthought --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I replicate my\nquestion because what I'm thinking is simply that there\nare thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims\nthat people go to arbitration over. And what I'm\nwondering here is if you win here, what is the set of\nsuch claims that I have now said that a union, through a\ncollective bargaining contract, can force the employee\nagainst his will to go to arbitration over? I don't\nhave a feeling for that from the briefs. I don't have a\nfeeling that you want to say that discrimination claims\nare special in that regard, that there's no line in that\nregard, or that there's some other line.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nthink that your question really is getting at the theory\nbehind collective bargaining agreements and what extent\nthe union can exercise control over the individual\nrights and circumstances of employment. That question\nis a very complex question over which many, many --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, can you give me a\nhint as to the principle?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: I -- well, I think that\nthere are limits, of course, on the union's authority\nthat have been recognized in this Court's decisions, and\nI don't think that ruling in the workers' favor in this\ncircumstance opens up any kind of Pandora's box at all,\nbecause all we are arguing for is that the\nGardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court\nunanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of\nthe land, as the Court has reaffirmed --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if a collective\nbargaining agreement requires the arbitration of\ndiscrimination claims that are not based on Federal law?\nMaybe they are based on -- they are based on State law\nthat goes further than Federal law, or maybe they are\nbased on a type of discrimination that's prohibited\nneither by Federal or State law. Maybe it's\ndiscrimination against young people under 40. Could\nthose be -- those would still be discrimination claims\nwith the same potential for -- with a potential for a\nconflict of interest. Could they be subjected to\nmandatory arbitration?\nMR. FREDERICK: I -- I think that is a\nharder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer\nunder this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points\nthe way here, in footnote 19 of the decision. Where the\nunion controls that process and where the union is a\npotential defendant in that circumstance, the workers'\nindividual rights cannot be subordinated --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- to the union's control.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if it's not a\nstatutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge? One\npractical problem is so often these are overlapping\nclaims. You can say, \"I was discriminated against\nbefore because of my age. I was arbitrarily\ndiscriminated against. It was a wrongful discharge. It\nwas a discharge without just cause.\" Usually, there's\nmultiple claims that can be made, and some of them would\nbe bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I\nmean if it was just a question of the worker says, \"I\nwas discharged without just cause,\" no Title 7 or\nanything else, that would come under the arbitration\nclause, wouldn't it?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, and I think that there\nhave been conditions of employment and discharge that\nhave been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a --\nan issue there where -- except where that intersection\nwith the statutory discrimination rights occurs. And\nCongress has made a different policy judgment with\nrespect to individual waivers of such rights in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why has it? Why has it? I\nmean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is\nthat he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two\nmonths. Now, you can't take away my right to that\nunless I voluntarily waived it. What is sacrosanct\nabout the fact that my grievance here has some\ndiscrimination attached to it?\nYour briefing talks as though it is\nsomething totally apart from a mere economic right.\nNinety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about\neconomics. \"I was fired because of discrimination.\" \"I\nwasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore\nI lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of\nmoney.\"\nWhy is it unthinkable that the -- that the\nemployee would have to go through the union-prescribed\narbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the\nlast three months but does not have to do it for an\neconomic injury that occurs because of discrimination?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I'm not sure actually\nin answering your hypothetical that they would\nnecessarily have to go through the union on the\nnonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case.\nThis Court in Barrentine said that, where an FSLA claim\nis at issue, the worker does not -- is not confined or\nprecluded after arbitrating at the union grievance\nprocess from bringing an FLSA suit in court.\nSo I want to reserve, accepting all of your\nhypothetical, Justice Scalia, but in further answer to\nthe point, I think it's important to keep in mind that\nin the discrimination context, you're talking about more\nthan just money. Here my clients are older workers who\nare forced into more physically strenuous positions that\nthey had gotten away from by virtue of their growth in\nseniority at the building.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that\nkind of conflict always present whenever you have\ncollective action? I mean, you may be a particularly\ngood worker and could demand a higher wage than the\nunion has negotiated, but you're still bound by the\ncollective bargaining agreement. That happens in every\nsituation where you have collective action.\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but where Congress has made a choice that\nindividual claims for individual anti-discrimination\nrights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and\nwhere this Court's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't\nhave to be vindicated in particular ways. The\nindividuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and\nthey would be -- the arbitration would be binding.\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but there is\nindividual consent in that circumstance. I would like\nto make a couple of other points before closing.\nOne is that on pages 4 to 5 in the brief in opposition\nto cert we specifically raise the issue that the union\ncontrols the arbitration, and there is no opportunity\nfor individual arbitration under this collective\nbargaining agreement.\nThere is nothing in the provision set out in\nthe petition appendix that gives individual rights, the\nindividuals the right to arbitrate under this collective\nbargaining agreement. The payment provision calls for\n50 percent by the employer and 50 percent by the\nemployee with the employer having the sole right to\nterminate the arbitrator for any or no reason at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You did raise that issue,\nbut you didn't say that the consequence of that issue\nwas that you win. You said the consequence of the fact\nthat that issue was involved in this case was a good\nreason not to -- for us to accept cert. And we didn't\ntake your advice on that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's a totally\ndifferent issue whether because of that question you --\nyou should -- you should win the case.\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly, the\ninterpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is\nfairly included within the question presented. And as\nthis Court found in Wright in a situation where it\ngranted certiorari on the very same question here but\nthen looked at the specific provisions of the collective\nbargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under\nthe facts there a different rule applied for a clear and\nunambiguous waiver.\nAll we are saying here is that under this\nprovision there is no opportunity for the individual to\narbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to\nthe one that is in Wright. We think that is fairly\nincluded within the question presented, and that the\nCourt can affirm on that basis, certainly where the\nSecond Circuit had relied on precedent that said that\nwhere the individual doesn't have a right, that it is\nunion control of arbitration. That is consistent with\nGardner-Denver.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be\nwithin the question presented. You -- you can sustain\nthe judgment below on any ground.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only question is\nwhether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire\ninto new ground. That's all.\nMR. FREDERICK: My only point is that this\nis one of these fuzzy areas where we are not making\nindependent, alternate ground of affirmance. I think\nour argument is fairly included within the question\npresented and can be affirmed on the basis of that\nargument.\nIf the court has no further questions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument\nthat you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting\nthe employee to a worse situation because the employer\nwill simply say: Fine, I don't have to bargain anything\nwith the union. If you want to work in this workplace,\nyou sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no\naccess to the court, and you have to -- just like in\nGilmer, just like in Circuit City.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nguess I would answer that question by saying we will pay\nour money and take our chances in the sense that the\nunions here are supporting the workers where the unions\nare acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of\ninterest, and the question of whether or not imposing\narbitration on the individual workers would be a\ncondition of employment. That is a question that you\ncan safely leave for another day.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they may go\nthe other way. They may say: Look, we don't like to\narbitrate. In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit\nto workers, but it is very expensive to bring these\nclaims, even with the prospect of recovering fees.\nMost of them like the idea that the union is\ngoing to stand up for them and take it to management,\nbut they could say: Look, we don't want it. If -- if\nyou are discriminated against, you know, sue us.\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, in fact,\nempirically that is not correct. There is a study that\nis cited in a footnote in one of the amicus briefs that\narbitration is more expensive than bringing civil\nlitigation. And it is because the -- under -- under\ntheir provision if you pay 50 percent of the\narbitrator's costs, you can run up quite a big tab that\nyou would not have to pay --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under my\nscenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for\narbitration. There would be -- there would be no\narbitration at all.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, under your scenario, I\nthink where the employer would control the arbitral\nprocess, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his\nbread.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There is no\narbitration. The employer says: Look, I don't think I\ndiscriminate. I've got a good record. I'm not going to\nagree to arbitrate claims. I'm going to make people go\nto court because there will be fewer claims brought.\nMR. FREDERICK: And -- and that has been the\nlaw for 30 years, and we think it should continue to be\nthe law, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf the marketplace is going to help weed out\nthose claims, that's certainly the province of lawyers\ntaking these cases and clients deciding whether or not\nto tell everybody to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is\nthere are benefits to employees from arbitration as\nwell.\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The employer may not\nagree to it. If he doesn't have any protection, if it\ndoesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to\ncourt, what's the -- what's the point?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's why this Court has\nalways said that individual consent and agreement is a\nfundamental precept of arbitration. Where that\nagreement is absent, a worker should not be forced.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: Respondents' fundamental right to a\nworkplace free of invidious, class-based discrimination\nis something their union has no power to barter away in\ncollective bargaining, and the union --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I just want to be sure\nthat at some point you answer this question, if you can.\nI -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us,\nas I see it, is just what you said: When can a union\nrequire the worker to accept arbitration rather than a\ncourt case in an instance where the union member has not\nsigned a special waiver? That's the question, right?\nOkay.\nAnd what I think some of us were struggling\nfor here is: If we say yes to you they can force them,\nor no to you they can't, what's the principle?\nNow, the easiest kind of case where you tend\nto think they can force the worker into arbitration is\nwhere the right grows out of the collective bargaining\nagreement, period.\nThen we have what we were talking about with\nJustice Souter, a common law tort claim. Then we might\nhave a State law giving a claim. Then we might have a\nFederal law like this one giving a claim.\nAnd we just heard -- I would assume if\nJustice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response\nwas, which was the FSLA: Oh, well, maybe we can't, you\nknow, force the worker to give that one up either.\nSo what is the line here that we are drawing\nwith this case? Is it a line that says discrimination\nlaws, Federal or special? Federal laws are special?\nState laws are special? Common law is special?\nCollective bargaining, too? What is the principle?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Breyer. This\nCourt's cases have not yet described a specific law, and\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I am asking you\nfor the principle.\nMR. GANNON: I think that the -- the best\nline that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver\nand Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are\nrelated to collective activity, and especially economic\nactivity, are the kinds of things that are normally\ndelegated to the union. Those are the sorts of things\nthat the union can actually engage in collective\nbargaining about. And when the union negotiates the\nunderlying right, then it makes perfect sense that the\nlabor arbitration framework that's set forth here would\ncontinue to resolve disputes that are arising under --\nout of that specific right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why doesn't this\ncome within that?\nMR. GANNON: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't many of these\ncases, if not most of them, come within that? The union\nnegotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the\nperson says: I should be at this level. The only\nreason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated\nagainst.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think, Justice\nScalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you call it a\nnon-economic theory. Phooey, it's an economic case.\nMR. GANNON: But I think what's important,\nJustice Scalia, is -- is, though -- is the line that the\nCourt stated in Barrentine: That if a statute is\ndesigned to give specific, minimum protection to\nindividual workers, then that's the sort of thing that\nthe union doesn't have the power to engage in collective\nbargaining over.\nAnd so your salary may well be something\nthat the union can normally bargain about. But if you\nwant to assert that the -- that the employer or the\nunion -- because both are the types -- the types of\nentities that can be charged with discrimination under\nTitle VII or the ADA or these other statutes -- the\nreason that they gave you a lower salary was on the\nbasis of something for which you had a Federal statutory\nprotection, then -- then you have an independent\nstatutory right that the union's majoritarian\ndecisionmaking processes should not be in the process of\ncontrolling --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not taking away the\nright. The -- the union is not taking away the right.\nIt's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to\narbitration instead of to the courts.\nMR. GANNON: Yes. And the difference is\nthat the union is making the decision about where the\nclaim will be vindicated. And in this case in\nparticular, the union is going to control whether the\nclaim will actually be able to be officially vindicated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -- you have\nfocused on the fact that Congress has given individual\nrights. But for the many matters that you say are the\nsubject of collective bargaining, you don't need a\nstatute. I don't need a statute to negotiate with\nsomeone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour\nfor a particular job. And, yet, that is something that\nyou give up when you join the union, and you are subject\nto collective bargaining.\nMR. GANNON: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't it\n-- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights?\nWhy aren't they subject to collective bargaining as\nwell?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- even the employer\nhere is not claiming that the underlying statutory right\nis subject to collective bargaining. They are just\nsaying --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I am --\nthe -- the forum for asserting the right.\nMR. GANNON: Well, in this instance Congress\ngave individual employees the right to bring a civil\naction in a judicial forum as a means of enforcing their\nantidiscrimination claims. And although arbitration may\nalways provide an alternative forum for that, this Court\nhas repeatedly made clear that arbitration is always a\nmatter of contract. And it does not impose on the\nemployer any more than on the employee a requirement\nthat they arbitrate a claim when they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would any\nemployer want to agree to arbitration under this system?\nHe gets nothing from it. You said you get the ben -- to\narbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.\nMR. GANNON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndon't think that that's true. Since 1974, this has been\nthe law of the land, and it's been even after Gilmer in\nevery circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just begs the\nquestion that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is\ncorrect.\nMR. GANNON: Well, it -- it is the\nprevailing interpretation in every circuit that has\nconsidered the question since Gilmer except the Fourth\nCircuit. And if you look at the empirical data that's\nmentioned in some of amicus briefs, including the\nparticular amicus brief of the National Academy of\nArbitrators, it is true that even when there is just a\nlabor arbitration machinery that was invalid under the\nterms of Gardner-Denver and would not be binding on the\nemployee if the employee happens to lose in that\narbitration, in most of those cases when the employee\nloses that arbitration, he does not go on to file an\nindependent case in federal court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position -- so\ntheir position is going to hurt most employees, because\nassuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union\ngets something in return for agreeing to that. I don't\nknow what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree\nto arbitrate all these claims. Well, you don't get that\nanymore, because and employer is not going to agree to\narbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to\narbitrate.\nMR. GANNON: Well, we don't think that there\nis any reason why the employees will not be able to make\na grievance with the employers, as was made possible in\nGilmer. And so that the point is that it just can't be\na vicarious agreement to arbitration on behalf of the\nindividual.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the employees\nhave no -- no leverage. I mean, if the -- if the\nemployer wants to say, look, if you want to work here,\nlook, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees\ndon't have bargaining leverage. That's the whole reason\nyou have a union.\nMR. GANNON: Well, there was an argument in\nGilmer that they didn't have leverage, either. And the\nCourt stressed that as long as the employee has actually\nagreed to it, that -- and -- and as long as the arbitral\nforum is going to be adequate to provide for effective\nvindication of the underlying statutory rights, then --\nthen the arbitral forum would be adequate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the employer did\nhave the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it\ntells each employee you have to sign an arbitration\nform, could the union in its collective bargaining\nnegotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and\nthat you shall not impose this obligation?\nMR. GANNON: Well, that's -- as\nMr. Frederick mentioned and is as discussed in several\nof the briefs, that's an undecided question of labor\nlaw. The National Labor Relations Board --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking in your view if\nit came up to it, how would that be decided --\nMR. GANNON: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I'm concerned it's\nthe same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just\ndon't think the employer is going to get very much under\nthis interpretation. And that may, ultimately, hurt the\nemployee.\nMR. GANNON: We think that as long as the\nemployee have been -- have been able to indicate exactly\nthe same level of individual agreements that was upheld\nin Gilmer and that the arbitral forum itself is going to\nbe adequate, that that takes care of that half of the\nquestion.\nThe National Labor Relations Board which\nhas -- which would be entitled to deference on this\nquestion and which has never spoken to the labor law\nquestion of what role the unions might be able to play\nin helping facilitate the agreements negotiated between\nthe employers and the individual employees, it could\ncome out in at least three different ways.\nOne of them is the arrangement outlined in\nthe Abbott D.C. Circuit decision that -- that\nPetitioners rely upon. But, of course, that's an\ninstance where there were two completely separate\nagreements that the employment arbitration was agreed to\nby the employees before they are even represented by the\nunion. It was at the outset of the establishment of the\nemployment relationship, which Mr. Frederick discusses.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't it boil down --\ndoesn't your argument really boil down to this: That\nthe only case in which it's really going to matter is\nthe case in which the arbitration agreement contains a\nclause that gives the union plenary authority over the\ndisposition of the claim? And I say that for this\nreason. If -- if this is outside the subject of\nmandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it;\nin effect, as a matter of individual contract.\nIf it's within the subject of mandatory\nbargaining but it's not effective unless the employee\nalso signs at the time of the incident or at the time he\nis hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only\ncase in which it's going to make any difference as to\nwhether you win or he wins is the case in which the\nagreement has got a clause in there that gives the union\nplenary authority to dispose of the claim.\nIsn't that correct?\nMR. GANNON: Well, not necessarily, Justice\nSouter, because there are all sorts of other attributes\nof the arbitral forum that might -- might well be\nrelevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to\neffectively been -- rights. In Gilmer itself, the Court\nspecifically considered whether the employee,\nMr. Gilmer, would have an opportunity to play a role in\nselecting the arbitrator.\nIn this instance, even under Petitioner's\nview of the CBA, which we don't think is supported by\nthe text of the CBA, this -- these employees are still\nstuck with an arbitrator who has been chosen by the\nemployer and by the union. And those are the two\nentities that have already decided that their claim is\nmeritless.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- more variables of Justice\nSouter's question, if those variables are satisfied,\nwhat's -- what is your answer to his question?\nMR. GANNON: If the variables are --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You're saying that this\nmight -- this might not be true and that may not be\ntrue, but suppose all of those other requirements are\nsatisfied?\nMR. GANNON: We think that there needs to be\nindividual agreement in order to comply with Gilmer\nbecause of the underlying inherent tension between the\ncollective interest of the union and the individual\ninterests of the employees, especially in\nanti-discrimination statutes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Salvatore, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SALVATORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice. A couple of quick points in response.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salvatore, would you\nstraighten out this business it seems about who pays?\nMr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid\nby the employee. If the union bows out and there is\njust the employer and the employee in the arbitration,\nthat employee would have to pick up 50 percent. I think\nI understood him to say that.\nMR. SALVATORE: And I refer you, Justice\nGinsburg, to page 47a of the joint -- of the petition\nappendix, which contains the main frame arbitration\nArticle 6 of this collective bargaining agreement, the\nlast paragraph --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What page did you -- did\nyou reference?\nMR. SALVATORE: 47a of the petition\nappendix, the last paragraph on that page.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Article 7, no.\nMR. SALVATORE: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said Article 6. Isn't\nit Article 7, if it's on 47a?\nMR. SALVATORE: Article 6 starts on 43a. It\ngoes all the way over to 47a of the petition appendix,\nright after the ellipses at the bottom of the page.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. Okay, so you\nare on 6. I got you.\nMR. SALVATORE: The cost of the office of\nthe contract arbitrator shall be shared equally in a\nmanner determined by the union and the RAB. The way\nthat the parties -- the bargaining parties have\ndetermined that these costs be shared is that if -- if\nthe union is not involved in a case, the employer pays.\nAnd -- and so, that's -- I mean, that's right from the\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that written down\nsomewhere?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear?\nMR. SALVATORE: That's -- that's the -- the\nagreement between the collective bargaining parties.\nIt's not -- it's not written down beyond that -- that --\nthat place. The office -- that place in the contract.\nThe office of the contract arbitrator is -- is -- is a\nplace. It's an arbitration forum. It's like going to\nthe American Arbitration Association.\nIt has hearing rooms. It -- it -- there --\nit has administrators who assign the arbitrators. The\narbitrators aren't picked out of -- you know, by one\nside or the other. Yes, they are put on the panel by --\nby the bargaining parties, but they are picked by a case\nadministrator.\nThere's 700 arbitrations that go on in this\nindustry every year and that's why instead of going to\nthe American Arbitration Association, these parties a\nlong time ago set up their own. A couple --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the -- if the idea is\nthat the union sees this right to the worker, then\ndoesn't have to -- doesn't the burden go with the right\nas well? I mean, the -- if the union would pay, you're\nsaying that the employer will just accept that the\nemployer picks up the entire tab?\nMR. SALVATORE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And\nthere are -- are several points. First, there is no\nconflict here in this case. The union did the right\nthing. It turned the claim over to the individual\nemployees with their private counsel and let them go\narbitrate it themselves. They refused. This isn't a\nMagnavox situation. The union is not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, they didn't turn it\nover, did they, until the action had been brought in the\nFederal court? I mean, they didn't -- maybe I'm wrong\nin this, but I didn't think that on day one they -- they\nsaid, oh, well, because the union doesn't want to\nproceed with this, you're welcome to chug ahead by\nyourself.\nMR. SALVATORE: Let me explain that time\nframe, Justice Souter. What happened here was the claim\nwas originally tendered by these employees to the union\nto bring an arbitration. The union decided after the\nfirst hearing day with the arbitrator that they couldn't\ngo forward for whatever reasons -- it's not in the\nrecord -- and then they, several months went by, these\nemployees filed with their counsel at the EEOC under\nWaffle House, we did nothing and waited and the --\nrepresenting the employers, and then the -- the lawsuit\nwas filed.\nAt that point the record is clear that\ndemand was made on -- on the employee's counsel,\nMr. Kreisberg -- it's in his affidavit -- that -- that\nhe returned to Arbitrator Pfeiffer to the pending\narbitration and continue in that forum, and he refused\nto. That was the basis of the motion to compel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
