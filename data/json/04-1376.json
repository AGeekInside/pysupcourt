GOSSETT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. GOSSETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUsing the ordinary tools of statutory\nconstruction, it is clear that Congress intended the\n1996 reinstatement provision to apply only\nprospectively. But even if Congress had no specific\nintent as to the retroactive applicability of that\nprovision, under Landgraf it would, nonetheless, not\napply in this case.\nApplying it to aliens who reentered before\nIIRIRA's effective date would give the statute an\nimpermissibly retroactive effect. Before IIRIRA, such\naliens were entitled to seek, and eligible to receive,\ndiscretionary relief from deportation. Now if the\nprovision is applied to them, they are not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't it be the\nsame result if Congress decided, for example, to take\naway one of the available methods of seeking\ndiscretionary review, just saying, \"We're not going to\nhave that available anymore\"?\nMR. GOSSETT: Congress might change the\nspecific types of review that are available, and then\nthis Court would have to -- but would either have to --\nwould have to engage in a Landgraf analysis of whether\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that would be --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- that would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a pretty easy\ncase, wouldn't it? I mean, if you have a mechanism\nsaying some -- an alien in this position can apply for,\nyou know, this type of relief, this type of relief, or\nanother, and they say, \"Well, we're not going to allow\nthis type of relief anymore. We're going to change\nthose\" -- was -- that's a pretty easy case, under\nLandgraf, isn't it?\nMR. GOSSETT: The -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd the transition from suspension of deportation to\ncancellation of removal would fall into that category.\nHowever, the reinstatement provision talks in terms --\nin categorical terms of any forms of relief from\ndeportation. It doesn't specify the particular types\nof relief that would be available --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why should that --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- and, therefore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why should that make a\ndifference as to whether it's retroactive or not? I\nmean, if it -- it seems to me you look to the activity\nthat it governs. And the activity that it governs is\nthe deportation or removal from now on.\nNow, you could argue that -- if you want,\nthat there are some due process violations in making\nthat prospective law affect past activities as they do.\nI mean, let's -- one of the examples given in\nLandgraf, or at least in my concurrence in Landgraf,\nwas a change of the law procedure so that expert\ntestimony, which previously was not admissible, is now\nadmissible. Now, the person who committed the crime\nthat's involved in the next case that comes up when\nthat new procedural rule is applied, he can say, \"Well,\nyou know, you've changed -- you've changed the rules on\nme. When I committed the crime, the expert testimony\nwasn't admissible. Now it is admissible. That's not\nfair.\" Well, whether it's fair or not is something we\ncan inquire into under the due process clause, but\nnobody would say that that procedural change is\nretroactive. And it --\nMR. GOSSETT: Two --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- seems to me that's what's\ngoing on here.\nMR. GOSSETT: Two responses, Justice Scalia.\nThe first is, I think it's unfair to say that this\nprovision merely regulates the procedure of removal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't my point. My\npoint --\nMR. GOSSETT: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- was, you look to the --\nto the activity which is governed by the new law. In\nthe case of the -- of the expert testimony, the\nactivity governed is the trial, so that law applies\nprospectively to all future trials. So, also, in this\ncase, this law applies prospectively to all future\nremovals, QED. It is not retroactive. Now, you may\nhave an argument, although I don't think it's a very\ngood one, that there are due process problems involved\nin this prospective law. But I don't see how you can\ncall the law retroactive.\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, the portions of\nthe reinstatement provision, besides for the provision\nbarring other forms of relief, I would agree, are\nsimply procedural provisions. And, again, there might\nbe due process challenges to those, but I -- we're not\nraising those here. It's the provision that says that\nmerely because you illegally reentered the country at\nsome prior date, you will -- because you illegally\nreenter the country, you will be ineligible, that I\nthink can only fairly be categorized as regulating the\nprocess of reentry, not the process of removal. It's -\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't affect --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- the fact that you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't affect his\nreentry at all. His reentry occurred. It -- how could\nit possibly have anything to do with his reentry?\nMR. GOSSETT: Under Your Honor's analysis, a\nstatute that said that if the Attorney General finds\nthat an alien has reentered in the past, the alien may\nbe sentenced to 15 years in prison, would also merely\nbe procedural and governing the sentencing rather than\nthe underlying act of reentry. I think that parallel\nhypothetical, which obviously would -- would violate\nthe ex post facto clause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would apply new\npenalties to the reentry. This law does not apply any\nnew penalties to the reentry, it just -- it just\nestablishes a new regime for removing the person who\nhas reentered.\nMR. GOSSETT: But the act of removing the\nright to seek adjustment of status, suspension of\ndeportation, voluntary departure, that is a new\npenalty. In the Landon v. Placencia case, in fact,\nthis Court called those \"substantive rights.\" It\ncalled, specifically, voluntary departure and\nsuspension of deportation \"substantive rights.\" That's\nat 459 U.S. 26 to 27. Therefore, I think it's unfair\nto say that the removal of those substantive rights is\nmerely a procedural change. Of course, we don't even\nget into the question of whether there's a procedural\nchange here, or a substantive change, unless we get to\nstage two of the Landgraf analysis under the -- under,\nI would say, either the majority's approach in Landgraf\nor your approach, Justice Scalia, because the first\nstage of Landgraf is about this Court's deferring to\nCongress's specific intent as to the applicability of a\nstatute, because if Congress has decided whether a\nstatute should apply prospectively or retroactively,\nthis Court defers to that, outside of the ex post facto\ncontext. And I think here it's clear that, in fact,\nCongress intended the 1996 reinstatement provision to\napply only prospectively.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has any -- a number of\ncourts have considered this question -- have any of\nthem accepted your first -- your argument that the\nstatute is clear that it is nonretroactive?\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, both the\nSixth and the Ninth Circuits have accepted that\nargument. They've accepted it in a slightly different\nform than we are currently raising, because before the\nGovernment's brief in this case, no one has laid out\nthe history of the 1950 and 1952 statutes as carefully\nas the Solicitor General's Office now has. But both\nthe Sixth and Ninth Circuit have held that this statute\nis exclusively prospective by a comparison between the\n1952 Act and the 1996 Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd -- I'll have to look\nat those decisions. It was my impression that they\ndid, indeed, hold that it was retroactive, but not on\nthe ground that Congress had clearly spoken to the\npoint, so that you didn't need any further inquiry.\nMR. GOSSETT: Both -- they didn't use the\nterm \"clearly,\" because, of course, as we explained in\nour brief, there's an asymmetry in retroactivity\nanalysis, and using the ordinary tools of statutory\nconstruction, one can demonstrate a prospective intent\non the part of Congress. But both the Sixth and the\nNinth Circuit, in the Bejjani case and the Castro-\nCortez case, did stop their retroactivity analysis at\nstage one of the Landgraf inquiry --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- decided that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think that's because\nthey were using the version of stage one that you are\nusing, which includes, in the consideration of whether\nCongress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the --\nwhether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I\nunderstand it, should be left to stage two,\nexclusively.\nMR. GOSSETT: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your analysis in your brief\nmingles the two. It says one of the factors that you\ncan take into account in stage one is whether it's\nretroactive. And as I -- I don't understand Landgraf\nto speak that way. I thought you were supposed to use\nall other indicia of legislative intent, other than the\nnormal rule against retroactivity, in deciding\ncongressional intent, and then you go to stage two,\nwhich is where retroactivity comes in.\nMR. GOSSETT: In both the St. Cyr's case and\nthe Lindh case, this Court did invoke the presumption\nagainst retroactivity in its stage one analysis. But,\nmore generally, I don't think we need a presumption to\nwin this case. I think that -- under stage one, under\nan inquiry into congressional intent -- what we have in\nthis case is a history of Congress providing for the\nreinstatement of deportation that goes back to 1950.\nIn 1950, Congress passed a reinstatement provision that\nsaid that for the specified aliens -- and it was only a\nsubgroup -- if they were deported and reentered, they\nwould be -- that their previous deportation order would\nbe reinstated. The INS -- and that statute's quoted\nat page 2 of the Government's brief -- the INS\ninterpreted that statute as applying only\nprospectively, and only applying to an alien who was\ndeported, and, therefore, obviously reinstated --\nreentering after the effective date of that statute.\nNow, in 1952, Congress, evidently\ndissatisfied with an interpretation -- with a\nreinstatement provision that was only prospective,\nadded the \"before or after\" language to the\nreinstatement provision. They said, under this 1952\nAct, \"If you were deported, either before or after the\neffective date of the INA, your deportation order can\nbe reinstated.\" But in 1996, Congress removed that\n\"before or after\" clause. Congress expanded the scope\nof reinstatement and provided that a much broader\ncategory of reentrants could be subject to\nreinstatement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but as the Government\npoints out, that \"either before or after\" applied to\nwhen you had been deported --\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not to when you\nreentered. And what we're -- what you're arguing for\nhere is a rule that goes from the time of reentry, not\nfrom the time of deportation. So, it's not really a\nparallel.\nMR. GOSSETT: Actually, Justice Scalia, under\nour stage one argument, we are now arguing that, in\nfact, the Government is right, that the 1952 Act was\ntied to the date of deportation. What we don't\nunderstand is how the Government thinks that helps its\ncase, because the obvious and necessary consequence of\nthat is that the removal of the \"before or after\"\nclause in 1996 must imply that the 1996 provision only\nis triggered by post-enactment deportations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's an --\nMR. GOSSETT: And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that may be a\nreasonable inference, but I think it's a real stretch\nto say that it \"clearly establishes.\" When you're\ntalking about a statute, and you say something's\n\"clear,\" you want to be able to point to actual words.\nAnd, on the other side, the Government points out\nthat, elsewhere in IIRIRA, Congress specifically\ndelineates when it wants the statute to apply\nprospectively only. And they did not do that in this\ncase.\nMR. GOSSETT: They also specifically\ndelineated, in some context, Mr. Chief Justice, that it\nwould be retroactive. The Government's primary\ncomparison -- and I think it's an important one for\nthis Court to focus on -- is to the criminal\nreinstatement provision, which is section 1326 -- 8\nU.S.C. at 1326.\nNow, the Government asserts that that\nprovision is exclusively prospective, and, therefore,\nthat the comparison should be that, in this context,\nthe reinstatement provision must be retroactive. But,\nin so arguing, the Government hides, in ellipses in its\nbrief, on page 14, the actual text of the provision of\nthe criminal -- the temporal applicability of the\ncriminal reentry provision. What Congress actually\nsaid was that deportations that predate IIRIRA could\ntrigger reinstatement, but reentries post- -- only\nreentries post-dating IIRIRA could trigger it. So, in\nfact, what Congress was doing in the criminal context\nwas reaching back and saying, \"We're changing the\nconsequences of pre-enactment deportations, but not\npre-enactment reentry.\" So, the comparison, if\nanything, I think, strengthens our case. I'd say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I -- you\nlost --\nMR. GOSSETT: The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- me there.\nMR. GOSSETT: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you --\nMR. GOSSETT: That's on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking at page -\n-\nMR. GOSSETT: -- page --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm --\nMR. GOSSETT: It's quoted on page 27, note\n15, of our opening brief. It's section 324(c) of\nIIRIRA. I can read it, exactly, \"The amendment made by\nsubsection (a) expanding the criminal reentrant\nprovision shall apply to departures that occurred\nbefore, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act,\nbut only with respect to entries and attempted entries\noccurring on or after such date.\" The Government omits\nthe fact that it applies to deportations pre-IIRIRA.\nSo, I think that there are two cases that\nthis Court has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't how --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- decided --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how that\nundermines their point that when Congress wants to\nspecify that something \"shall apply prospectively\nonly,\" as they quote, \"only with respect to entries\noccurring on or after a date,\" they spell it out. And\nthey did not similarly spell it out in the provision on\n-- that you suggest is prospective only.\nMR. GOSSETT: No, Justice -- Mr. Chief\nJustice. I agree that this doesn't explicitly spell it\nout in the criminal provision, but I don't think we\nneed to explicitly spell it out -- or we -- that this\nCourt needs to find that Congress explicitly spelled\nout the prospective applicability. I think that the\nLindh case and the American National Red Cross case\nboth demonstrate that when Congress changes text over\ntime, it matters. In the Lindh case, of course, there\nwere two provisions, one of which had retroactivity\nlanguage, the other which had none, and -- and this\nCourt intuited that, \"Therefore, Congress must have\nmeant that the -- the section without retroactivity\nlanguage would be exclusively\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish we could get some new\nvocabulary. Terminology is destiny, and I really don't\nfollow the discussion of speaking about whether it was\nprospective or retroactive. I don't think, whichever\nway it applied, it is retroactive. But the issue still\nremains, Did Congress intend pre-IIRIRA reentries to be\ncovered or not? I --\nMR. GOSSETT: Was it triggered?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I would consider that\nstill prospective, but just note my --\nMR. GOSSETT: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that I don't --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- I think, actually --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- go along with you when\nyou force this terminology on me, whether Congress\nintended it to be retroactive. As I see it, the issue\nis whether Congress intended it to apply to reentries\nthat occurred before IIRIRA was enacted. I would not\nconsider that retroactive, but it's still an open\nquestion what Congress intended.\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, I agree -- I\nagree that that's for purposes -- that terminology is\nbetter for stage one. It's -- whether it was triggered\nby a pre-enactment deportation or reentry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Aren't there several possible\nexplanations for why Congress would leave the \"before\nor after\" language out of the -- out of the new\nprovision? They might have wanted it just to be\ndecided under the Landgraf framework. Isn't that one\npossibility? Or they might have thought that \"before\nor after\" referred to the enactment of the INA, which\nwould be 1952, and, therefore, irrelevant by the time\nthis was passed.\nMR. GOSSETT: I don't think either of those\npossibilities is plausible, Justice Alito. The first\nis implausible because we know that the INS had already\ninterpreted the 1950 Act, which was silent as to\napplicability, to be exclusively prospective. And the\nsecond is implausible because the -- the \"before or\nafter\" provision in the 1952 Act, which would\npresumably have been brought forward, the 1996 Act, had\nthey wanted to, specified the date of enactment of this\nAct. It would have been about this Act. And, in fact,\nthe Senate proposal to modify the first -- the\nprovision also would have left it in terms of this Act,\nnot of a specific date of 1952, which would have been\nthe INA date.\nMore generally, I think that with this\nhistory of the 1950 Act, the 1952 Act, and the 1996\nAct, any interpretation of the 1996 Act as being\nretroactive, or as being ambiguously retroactive,\ndoesn't pay adequate deference to Congress's choice\nover time that this Act should apply prospectively in\n1996.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would -- I find it\ndifficult to understand why Congress wouldn't have\nwanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come\nin before IIRIRA. Bear in mind, these are people who\nhave been deported once, already deported once, and\nthen, in violation of the law, come back in again. And\nthere was a regime for deporting them, which allowed\ncertain variations, which are eliminated by IIRIRA,\npermission for them to stay. You really think Congress\nwanted to keep faith with the people who had, already\nhave -- having been deported once for illegal reentry -\n- illegal entry -- come in again -- and you think\nCongress says, \"Oh, well, you know, we have to keep\nfaith with these people who are violating our law, and\nnot -- and not deport them except under the conditions\nthat existed when they broke the law to reenter\"? I\nfind that a very -- what should I say? -- touching --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- attitude for Congress to\nhave.\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, clearly\nCongress was attempting to change -- or to increase the\ndisincentives to reentry. At the same time that they\nmodified the reinstatement provision, they extended the\ncriminal reentry provisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not only the --\nMR. GOSSETT: So, the question isn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- disincentives.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- whether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were trying to get out\nof the country people who were here illegally, two-time\nlosers who were here illegally for the second time.\nMR. GOSSETT: The question, however, though,\nis not whether they were trying to change that\nconsequence. The question is whether they did so\nretroactively, because this Court presumes that if\nCongress is trying to change the consequences of an\naction that has occurred in the past in substantive\nways, Congress should say so explicitly, because, as\nyour -- you have said in previous decisions, it is a\nfoundational principle of Western law that primary --\nthe consequences of primary conduct are judged as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is that --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- of the time of that conduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- so here? I want to know,\nif your client had known about this law or gone to a\nlawyer and said, \"What do I do now?\" wouldn't the\nlawyer have said, or would he have said, \"Just leave.\nLeave the country, quick, before you're caught. Now,\nwhen you get back to Mexico, you can apply and point\nout you've married an American citizen, and then you'll\nbe able to come in, in all likelihood.\" And if I'm\nright about that, the Act does not attach new\nconsequences to old behavior, it attaches new\nconsequences to new behavior; namely, the act of\nstaying within the United States, when you could leave.\nMR. GOSSETT: I presume, Justice Breyer, you\nmean at the time that Congress enacted IIRIRA?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean when this particular\n--\nMR. GOSSETT: Was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- provision was passed --\nMR. GOSSETT: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- a week later, he goes to\na lawyer, and the lawyer says, \"You'd better get out of\nhere fast, because if you're caught while you're here,\nyou're married now, and you won't be able to take\nadvantage of that. It would be terrible. So, go to\nMexico. Then there is no problem.\" And if, in fact,\nI'm right, you see what I'm -- I find your argument\nexcellent on the first part, but so is the\nGovernment's. So, I think there's a kind of wash\nthere, so I'm looking to the second part. And there,\nyou're just said, it attaches new consequences to old\nbehavior. So, I'm asking you, if it doesn't attach the\nnew consequences to old, but, necessarily, plus new\nbehavior -- namely, remaining.\nMR. GOSSETT: No, Justice Breyer, it does\nnot, because had he left in 1996, upon enactment of\nIIRIRA, he would have been inadmissible for 5 years --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- as a result of having left.\nWhereas, otherwise, otherwise, if he had stayed in the\ncountry, he would be eligible to apply for suspension\nof deportation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Being -- if you get married\n-- if you're outside the country and you marry an\nAmerican, you're married to an American and you can't\ncome in for 5 years?\nMR. GOSSETT: As a result of his initial --\nhaving reentered --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As a result of --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- within 5 years --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the initial deporting\norder.\nMR. GOSSETT: As a result of his reentry five\n-- within 5 years of the date of his 1981 deportation,\nhe would be ineligible for readmission for 5 years, had\nhe left the country.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, his choice is this Act\nor -- in which case, you never can get back, if you're\ncaught -- or go to Mexico, wait 5 years.\nMR. GOSSETT: Or 10 to 20 years, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ten to 20 years?\nMR. GOSSETT: Ten to 20 years if you're\ncaught, under this Act, is my understanding. It\ndepends on -- the Government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I mean, he either\nstays in the United States --\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in 10 to 20 years --\nMR. GOSSETT: No, we -- if he stays in the\nUnited States, he's -- and is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is caught.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- entitled to apply for these\nforms of relief from deportation, then he will -- then\nhe can become an American citizen, or become a lawful\npermanent resident, as a result of the forms --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you lose this --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- of relief that existed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- case -- if you lose this\ncase, then his choice would be: stay here, get caught,\nand you never can come back, or 10 to 20 years?\nMR. GOSSETT: Ten to 20 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. GOSSETT: Ten to 20.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or go to Mexico, and you can\ncome back in 5 years.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. GOSSETT: But, of course, at the time --\npre-IIRIRA, the choice was: stay in the country and\nseek -- and seek American citizenship through these\nother routes. And so, the forcing of him to leave is\nitself a retroactive effect of the enactment of this\nAct --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in this --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in this case, he was\nmarried after the effective date of the new statute.\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did Judge McConnell, in the\nTenth Circuit, suggest -- because he discussed this --\nsuggest that the result might have been different if\nthe marriage had been before?\nMR. GOSSETT: Yes, he did suggest that. And\nseveral courts have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would that be\nconsistent with his -- with his analysis?\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice -- Judge McConnell and\nseveral other courts have focused on the types of\nrelief that an alien was eligible for as of the\neffective date of IIRIRA. We think that's the wrong\nfirst inquiry. We think that the way to approach the\nstage two analysis is on a categorical basis, because\nCongress, in the statute, said that, at the time of\nreentry, the mere act of reentry wouldn't categorically\npreclude you from seeking any forms of relief from\ndeportation. And so, had Congress wanted to change\nthat, it would have -- it would have had to do so\nretroactively on a categorical basis. But even if one\naccepts Judge McConnell's analysis of the forms of\nrelief you're entitled to as of that date, at the very\nleast, at that point, my client would be eligible to\nseek both voluntary departure and cancellation of\nremoval. We think he'd -- also should be eligible to\nseek adjustment of status, because, although it's true\nthat he is not -- he was not, at that point, married to\nhis now-wife, adjustment of status was a -- is a\ndefense from deportation, and he would have been able\nto get married even if put into deportation\nproceedings. And given that, at that point, he and his\nnow-wife had -- already had a 8-year-old son --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- there would be no question\nthat it was a real marriage.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it does point out that\nyour argument is a difficult one, because this\nexpectation that you argue for is that, number one, he\nhas an expectation that he'd be able to adjust his\nstatus even after Congress has changed the law\nrespecting reinstatement.\nMR. GOSSETT: I don't think that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is --\nMR. GOSSETT: -- a difficult analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- this is a far-reaching\nexpectation on his part.\nMR. GOSSETT: The only expectation, Justice\nKennedy, that we are proposing is that my client -- and\naliens, generally, because this is an analysis that\nmust be done on a categorical basis -- reasonably\nexpected that Congress wouldn't change the consequences\nof their reentries far in the past without doing so\nexplicitly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I wrong in thinking\nthat readjustment based on his marriage was not one of\nthe modes of relief that he could have had in '82 or --\nthat that didn't come in until much later, is that so?\nMR. GOSSETT: That is true, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, any -- so, that was a\nconsequence that certainly wasn't taken away from him,\nbecause it wasn't there in '82.\nMR. GOSSETT: In 1982, Justice Ginsburg, my\nclient reasonably presumed that the act of reentry,\nwhile itself a crime and while itself rendering him\ndeportable, wouldn't categorically preclude him from\nseeking relief from deportation if, at a future date,\nhe might become eligible to adjust in some way, either\nthrough suspension of deportation by having been here\nfor 7 years, or by marrying an American citizen, or by\nhaving a reasonable claim for asylum. All of these\nwere routes to stay, despite illegal entry or reentry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would he think that?\nWhy wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is\nsubject to being deported under such rules as the\ncountry has for deporting people who are here\nillegally, whatever they may be, from time to time?\nThat would be my expectation if I came in illegally, in\nviolation of the law. I'm saying, \"I'm here at the\nsufferance of the country. I shouldn't be here. And\nwhatever rules they have for kicking me out are the\nrules that I'll have to abide by.\"\nMR. GOSSETT: The implications of your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"I'm lucky not to be in\njail.\"\nMR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, the implication\nof your argument is that a wrongdoer has no reasonable\nexpectation in the law staying constant. But, of\ncourse, both the Hughes Aircraft and the Landgraf\ndecisions are cases in which a conduct was clearly\nillegal or unlawful at the time it was done, but,\nnonetheless, a change in the law would retroactively\nchange the implications of that unlawful conduct. And\nthis Court, in both those cases, held that it was --\nthat such change cannot be effected retroactively.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, in St. Cyr --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- was -- in St. Cyr, I\nthink it was he pled guilty under one set of\nexpectations, and that's what the Court fastened on.\nIsn't that so?\nMR. GOSSETT: That's true, Justice Ginsburg.\nHowever, the parallel in St. Cyr is that at the time\nthe immigrant in St. Cyr pled guilty, he was\npresumptively deportable as a result of having pled\nguilty to a crime. He was eligible to seek\ndiscretionary relief from deportation, which this Court\ncalled \"a matter of grace\" in the St. Cyr decision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he --\nMR. GOSSETT: Similarly, here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- might not have pled\nguilty if there was a different set of rules. I\nthought that was what drove the Court's opinion.\nMR. GOSSETT: It's unclear to me whether or\nnot the St. Cyr case would also generalize to someone\nwho simply was convicted of a crime at that date. And\nthere's a debate in the lower courts about that. But,\nmore generally, in my client's context, at the very\nleast his decision to stay in the United States for 7\nyears, and thus become eligible for suspension of\ndeportation, and then not to leave thereafter, was,\nitself, a very similar choice to that of the alien in\nSt. Cyr. It's a conscious decision to remain here,\nrather than to leave.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If he had left voluntarily\nunder the pre-'96 law, would he still have been subject\nto criminal prosecution for his prior illegal entry if\nhe had later come back into the United States?\nMR. GOSSETT: I'm not sure, Your Honor. I\ndon't know.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. GOSSETT: If there are no further\nquestions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGossett.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nSection 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline the\nremoval of aliens who were already removed but have\nsince illegally reentered. The Congress that enacted\nIIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision and\nexempt those aliens who are already in the country\nillegally. Rather, the focus on streamlining the rules\nfor getting illegal reentrants out of the country is\nfully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicable\nto illegal reentrants who were already in the country\nat the time of IIRIRA's enactment.\nThree considerations, I think, point to the\nconclusion that section 1231(a)(5) is addressed to\nremoving illegal reentrants from the country, including\naliens who are already in the country, and that the\nprovision is not so much addressed to the antecedent\nact of illegal reentry, as such.\nThe first consideration I would point to is\nthe operation of the provision. And it's useful to\nbear in mind the following possible scenario in which a\nperson, who's been removed, illegally reenters the\ncountry, but then returns to his home country. Now, in\nthat situation the individual would have engaged in the\nact of illegal reentry, but section 1231(a)(5) simply\nwould have no relevance to him whatsoever, because what\nsection 1231(a)(5) seeks to do is to remove someone\nwho's found in the country on the basis of their\nprevious removal order. Now, if they have engaged in\nthe act of illegal reentry, but then have gone back,\nsection 1231(a)(5) simply is not relevant. And I think\nthat goes to show that what the statute is focused on\nis not the act of illegal reentry, as such, but,\nrather, removing someone who's found in the country and\nwho's determined to be an illegal reentrant.\nNow, that operation stands in significant\ncontrast to the criminal prohibition against illegal\nreentry, which is at 8 U.S.C. 1326, and the prohibition\nagainst illegal entry, which is 8 U.S.C. 1325. With\nrespect to both of those provisions, the act of illegal\nreentry, or the act of illegal entry, necessarily\ntriggers the operation of the criminal prohibition, and\nthere's nothing that the alien can do after the fact to\ntake himself outside of the -- of the purview of that\ncriminal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And those --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Should --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And those provisions are\nspecifically recited to apply only to reentrants after\nthe effective date.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Congress\nspecifically indicated, in the text of IIRIRA, that\nit's -- it understood the distinction between the way\nin which those provisions operate and the way that\n1231(a)(5) operates. The IIRIRA expanded the scope of\nthe criminal prohibition on an illegal reentry, and it\nalso, for the first time, imposed civil monetary\npenalties on the act of illegal entry. There were\ncivil fines, and then -- I think, $50 to $250 per\nepisode. But what's critical is that with respect to\nboth of those changes, Congress specified, in the terms\nof IIRIRA, that they would only apply, on a prospective\nbasis, to acts of illegal entry or reentry that post-\ndated IIRIRA. Now, Congress made no such specification\nwith respect to 1231(a)(5), and I think that's\nsignificant, because what that indicates is that\nCongress understood that that provision, unlike the two\ncriminal -- unlike the two criminal provisions, focuses\nnot on the act of illegal reentry, as such, but rather\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me go back to the\ncriminal provision for a second. I take it your answer\nto the question I asked your brother a moment ago is\nthat if the individual reenters, and, hence, has\ncommitted a criminal offense, and later voluntarily\nreturns to -- in this case, to Mexico, that the\ncriminal violation, in effect, would not, in any sense,\nbe canceled out.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that if he returned, he\ncould be prosecuted for the prior reentry. And I\nsuppose, in theory -- I don't know what the extradition\ntreaty is -- in theory, he might be subject to\nextradition for it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The odd way to --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The criminal act is\ncompleted at the moment that the criminal reentry is\ncompleted, and nothing that he does afterwards can take\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's no forgiveness --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- provision.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Which is\ndifferent, obviously, from the operation of section\n1231(a)(5).\nNow, another consideration that I think\nindicates that section 1231(a)(5) is focused on the\ntiming of the removal, as opposed to the timing of\nreentry, is to take into account section 1231(a)(5) in\nthe context of Section 1231 as a whole. Section 1231\nwas a new provision that was enacted by IIRIRA, and\nCongress entitled it, quote, \"Detention and Removal of\nAliens Ordered Removed,\" close quote. And, as its\ntitle indicates, the provisions in section 1231, like\n1231(a)(5), all pertain to executing an order of\nremoval against an alien who's been ordered removed.\nFor example, those provisions concern the time period\nwithin which somebody is to be removed. They address\nthe travel of somebody to the removal destination, the\nidentification of the countries to which they may be\nremoved, the payment of expenses. But all of them\naddress the execution of an order of removal in the\nsame way that section 1231(a)(5) does. Section\n1231(a)(5) speaks to the execution of the pre-existing\norder of removal, the one that the alien had in place\nwhen he illegally reentered the country, but it's of a\npiece with those other provisions, in the sense that\nit, like them, addresses the timing of removal rather\nthan speaking to the act of illegal reentry, as such.\nThe third consideration, I think, that points\nto the same conclusion, which is that Congress was\nfocused prospectively on removals that postdated\nIIRIRA, rather than retrospectively, in some sense, on\nacts of illegal reentry that predated IIRIRA, is that\nat the time of illegal reentry, as we explain in -- at\nlength in our brief, an alien would have had no\neligibility, as a categorical matter, and at least as a\npractical matter, for the three types of relief that\nPetitioner invokes. And those three types of relief\nare adjustment of status, suspension of deportation,\nand voluntary departure.\nNow, with respect to adjustment of status, as\nthe colloquy earlier indicated, at the time that\nPetitioner illegally reentered the country in 1981, up\nuntil 1994, which was just 2 years before IIRIRA,\nadjustment of status was categorically unavailable to\nillegal entrants and illegal reentrants. In that\nlight, it's -- one would be hard-pressed to assert that\nan illegal reentrant would have performed that act in\nreasonable reliance on the availability of adjustment\nof status. It was simply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- unavailable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want us to decide\nit on that ground, do you, so that all future cases\nyou'll have to decide whether he came in before '94 or\nafter '94, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice\nScalia. I think a virtue of focusing on the fact that\nthis statute is addressed to the removal, rather than\nthe act of illegal reentry, is that it decides, once\nand for all, what the temporal reach of the statute is.\nAnd --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your point,\nthough -- I mean, someone illegally reentering at that\ntime might not have had a reasonable expectation of the\navailability of discretionary relief. On the other\nhand, someone in the -- a petitioner's position, after\nall that had happened, did have a fairly good case\nunder those provisions that were no longer available.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that might be, Mr.\nChief Justice, but his claim is that section 1231(a)(5)\nshould be construed not to apply to anyone who\nillegally reentered before IIRIRA. And so, I think the\nproper frame of reference is to look, ex ante, at what\nsomeone would be thinking, had they illegally reentered\nbefore IIRIRA, because he seeks to treat everyone who\nillegally reentered before IIRIRA as a uniform\ncategory.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and someone\nentering says, \"Well, obviously, if I'm detained the\nday after I enter, I'm not going to have a very good\ncase. On the other hand, if I'm not, and I happen to\nmake a life here, and I'm here for 20 years, and I get\nmarried and I have a child, I'm going to have a strong\ncase,\" and he's going to -- he's willing to take his\nchances.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, two responses. First\nof all, that's not true with respect to adjustment of\nstatus, because someone who reentered before IIRIRA, at\nleast if they reentered before 1984, couldn't have\nimagined that their marriage to a United States citizen\nwould have given them a basis for adjustment, because\nadjustment simply was categorically unavailable to\nillegal entrants.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you say '84 or '94? I\ncouldn't --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: 1994, I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- I didn't -- I -- in '81,\nwhen he illegally reentered, through 1994, adjustment\nof status was categorically unavailable to people who\nillegally reentered, so he couldn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- have relied on the\navailability of that form of relief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the executive couldn't\nweigh that. You say, categorically, it -- there's no -\n-\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It simply wasn't provided --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- no possibility for\ndiscretion.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It simply wasn't provided\nfor by statute. A precondition of eligibility for\nadjustment, until 1994, was that the person was not an\nillegal entrant. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could the -- could\nthe INS have just stayed its hand for -- in --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I mean, I suppose they could\nhave stayed their hand, in the sense that they wouldn't\nhave applied the immigration laws to begin with, but I\ndon't think there --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- would have been any basis\nto stay their hand, in the sense of granting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't imagine that.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- adjustment of status.\nI'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I say, I cannot imagine\nthat. No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- but I -- I didn't\nunderstand this now. I guess I don't. Forget the\n'94/'96 periods.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it stayed the\nsame throughout. Would you say, then, that someone who\ncame illegally into the country, and he's caught, and\nhe's married to an American, there's no possibility he\ncan stay, no matter what, no matter how appealing? Is\nthat the answer?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Not with respect to\nadjustment of status.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- yes, but you're\ntalking technically.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, I'm speaking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe there's --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- technically, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- some other way you could\nstay. What's the other way?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There is -- there's another\nform of relief that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- conceivably could give\nthem a claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which was what?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- and that's suspension of\ndeportation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- which is the same --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- then it comes to the --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- same thing. So, that --\nwhat I'm thinking is that a person who is here, and\nthey marry an American -- all right? -- they marry a\ncitizen. Now, before this Act was passed, there was a\nway that if they're really good -- let's assume they're\nthe best human beings around, and the Attorney General\nfinds all that out, and everybody knows this is like a\nsaint, and they say, \"Okay, you behave well enough.\nYou can stay.\" Now, after the Act is passed, all those\nrelevant actions have taken place in '86, long before.\nNow, there's absolutely nothing they can do. All they\ncan do is go home. And now I've learned that when they\ngo home, they will be told, \"You cannot come back, no\nmatter what, for 5 years.\" Now, that's a pretty harsh\nconsequence, to separate yourself from your family or\nhave your family come to a foreign country. So, if I\nthink the first part of this is a wash, you have a\ngreat argument, they have a great argument, and I look\nto the second part, does it attach new consequences to\nold and unchangeable behavior? I say, yes, it sure\ndoes. Now, why doesn't it?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there's a lot in that\nquestion. Let me just try to address it one step at a\ntime.\nWith respect to whether it attaches new legal\nconsequences, I think you were right, Justice Breyer,\nearlier, in asking about what would happen if he had\ngone back voluntarily. Now, it's true that if he had\nbeen removed, then there would have been the\nconsequence, in the sense that there would be a period\nof inadmissibility, at least presumptive\ninadmissibility, a period, which, by the way, is\nsubject to waiver, which he could apply for. But if he\nhad just gone back voluntarily after IIRIRA's\nenactment, or, indeed, in the 6-month window between\nIIRIRA's enactment and IIRIRA's effective date, my\nunderstanding is that there would have been no\npresumptive period of inadmissibility.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. So, then, you're saying\nthe answer I got before was wrong --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that, in fact --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I now have my client in,\nhe's come after IIRIRA has been enacted, and he says,\n\"I've heard about this in IIRIRA, and what in heaven's\nname am I supposed to do?\" And the lawyer says, \"Get\nout fast, next train. Go back. And if you get across\nthat border, you're safe. Because at that point, you\ncan apply; and you're a saint, and you've been married,\nthey'll let you right in, because they'll find out.\"\nThat's what your view of the law is.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's my understanding of\nthe law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It must be the one way or\nthe other.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the five -- the 5-year\nperiod that Petitioners -- Mr. Gossett was referring\nto, I think, relates to the period after the point in\ntime at which somebody's deported or removed. And so,\nhis initial deportation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, in -- and this is not --\nI was saying the question --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- would be, is this Act\nattaching consequences to old things that you couldn't\ndo anything about? And you're saying, \"Not entirely.\nYou can. You can leave. In which case, you'll be no\nworse off, except for the train fare.\"\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's my --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- understanding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That person has not\nillegally reentered the United States? He's gone back,\nbut he did illegally reenter the United States. He\nwouldn't be covered by the same provision that we're\ntalking about?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, he -- you're right, Mr.\nChief Justice, that it's -- that he's illegally\nreentered. But he wouldn't be covered by this\nprovision, because all this provision seeks to do is to\nremove him. And then, once he's gone back, this\nprovision simply ceases to have any relevance to him at\nall, because he's, in some sense, self-removed. And\nso, he -- any ineligibility wouldn't stem from this\nprovision, it would come from somewhere else. And, as\nfar as I'm aware, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't be subject\nto the 5-year period of inadmissibility that's imposed\nby a separate provision and that would attach if he\nwere removed, because, by hypothesis, he wouldn't have\nremoved, he would have gone back on his own accord.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And even if he was, that was\nwaivable.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. That's\nsubject to waiver, which is another --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just as he doesn't\nautomatically get admitted because he's married, does\nhe?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's discretionary, as\nwell.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's discretionary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- at the end of the day --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- one discretion --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and another discretion.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And we lay this out\nin some detail in a -- in a footnote in our brief. And\nthat's at -- that's at pages 39 to 40. But that\nfootnote, I should point out, doesn't deal with your\nhypothetical, Justice Breyer, which is that he goes\nback of -- on his own accord. And, I think, in that\nsituation what he would do is what people ordinarily do\nwhen they're seeking to gain lawful admission to the\ncountry, which is to apply for admission on the basis\nof what would have been whatever relationships he could\nhave asserted at that point. Now, he wasn't married at\nthe time that IIRIRA was enacted, so he wouldn't have\nused his marriage as a basis for coming in, because he\nwasn't married as of yet. But I think that cuts more\nagainst him, rather than in his favor, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the instance --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- of course --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of a child --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who had -- he had a\nrelationship to a child in the United States. And\ncouldn't that have counted for suspension of\ndeportation or removal, whatever terms I use now? Did\n--\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for a hardship claim, a\nparent-child relationship?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg, it would count for purposes of suspension of\ndeportation, which was renamed cancellation of removal.\nBut that form of relief is available to somebody who's\ninside the United States, and I was meaning to address\nthe situation where he has voluntarily removed himself\nfrom the United States and is seeking admission from,\npresumably, Mexico, in which case, suspension of\ndeportation wouldn't really come into play, because\ndeportation wouldn't be on the table.\nBut, you're right that if he had stayed in\nthe country, suspension of deportation is a form of\nrelief that he would have been eligible for -- eligible\nfor, pre-IIRIRA. But, with respect to suspension of\ndeportation, I think it's important to understand that\nthat form of relief required an -- a period of presence\nin the United States of 7 years before one could gain\neligibility to seek that relief. And so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He was here -- he was here\nfor 20 --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- 20 years, though.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He was. So, he would have\nclearly met that eligibility criteria -- there is no\nquestion about that -- under the pre-existing law. But\nif you put yourself in the position of somebody who is\nentering, pre-IIRIRA, and is trying to determine\nwhether suspension of deportation is relief that would\nbe realistically available to them, you'd have to think\nthat they would act on -- in reliance on their ability\nto stay in the country for 7 years, and to remain\nundetected, only at which point they would qualify for\nsuspension of deportation. And that not only seems to\nme, as a factual matter, somewhat farfetched, but it's\nnot clear that the law should attach significance to\nthat sort of reliance --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- interest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it farfetched, in view\nof the history of now I- -- before INS, weren't there a\ngreat many people who got here and -- just as this\nPetitioner -- who just lived here for years and years,\nand were never disturbed?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: As an -- as an empirical\nmatter, I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg, but I'm\nnot sure that that necessarily means that that's a\nlegitimate expectation or a reasonable reliance\ninterest of the type that the Court would typically\ntake into account in its retroactivity inquiry, because\nat the end of the day what it is, is a reliance\ninterest that's predicated on essentially lack of\nprosecutorial resources, or a favorable exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion in some sense. And the Court\nhasn't attached significance to that sort of reliance\ninterest before. It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or, put more starkly, if I\ncontinue to violate the law for 7 years, I can count on\nthis kind of treatment. That's an odd reliance\ninterest.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, and --\nparticularly taking into account the reasonable reliance\n-- the category \"reasonable reliance\" is designed to take\n-- is designed to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- account for its fairness\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this elementary --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- interests.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- an elementary question,\njust to be sure we all agree on this? You do agree, do\nyou not, that if, in 1997, Congress passed a statute\nthat said you should get an extra $50 penalty for\nhaving come in, back in 1981, that would not be\npermissible?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. I think the\npresumption --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- against retroactive --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And there's sort of an\nirony in the fact that the actual consequence here is a\ngreat deal more serious.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the consequence of\nremoval is more serious --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- than -- in some sense,\nthan a $50 penalty. That's right. But this is a\nperson --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is constitutionally\nprohibited. But the consequences here are permitted.\nI understand the analysis. It's like just saying we\ntake away one ground for staying that we didn't have\nbefore. But looking at it in kind of a basic sense,\nthat seems -- it's a fairly serious thing --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that happens, and it\neffects an awful lot of people, doesn't it?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. I think it affects\nanyone who had illegally reentered, at least. But it's\nimportant to bear in mind that this is somebody who was\nalready subject to a removal order. So, in some sense,\nsending them back out of the country puts them in the\nsame position that they would have been in under the\nold removal order. And so, insofar as it has that\neffect on them, I think it's different than a $50\npenalty that attaches to the primary conduct of illegal\nreentry, as such.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you read the Tenth\nCircuit opinion as indicated it might have had a\ndifferent result if he had been married before the\nenactment of the statute?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There is that suggestion, I\nthink, in Judge McConnell's opinion, and that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does that fit with the\ncourt's theory?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: With the -- with the Tenth\nCircuit's theory or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does it --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- the idea was -- I think\nwhat the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize was that\nadjustment of status was categorically unavailable to\nsomebody who illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at\nleast before 1994. And what Judge McConnell presumed\nwas that it would have been available. And his point\nwas that even if it would have been available, it's\nfarfetched to think that somebody would have thought\nnot only about coming into the country, but coming into\nthe country and then meeting a United States citizen,\nand become married to the United States citizen, and\nusing that as sort of a reliance basis for not applying\nthe law retroactively to somebody who had come in\nbeforehand. But I think that was based on a\nmisimpression about the availability of adjustment of\nstatus.\nNow, I'd like to address, briefly, if I\ncould, the argument at step one of the Landgraf inquiry\nconcerning the negative inference the Petitioner seeks\nto draw from the \"before or after\" clause -- so-called\n\"before or after\" clause. And the two provisions can\nbe compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the\nGovernment's brief, and that's in the body of the\nGovernment's brief.\nThe fundamental flaw with the argument at\nstep one is that the \"before or after\" clause in the\nold provision, which is at the bottom of page 2,\nreferred, by terms, to the date of the INA's enactment.\nNow, what we've reflected is the codified version,\nwhich refers specifically to the date of June 27 of\n1952. But even the INA itself referred to the date of\nthe enactment of this Act, which can only be seen to\nrefer to the INA itself. So, if this language had been\ncarried forward in section 1231(a)(5), it still would\nhave been a reference to the date of the enactment of\nthe INA. So, it would refer to somebody who was\ndeported before or after 1952.\nNow, I think, as Justice Alito suggested, the\nprobable reason that Congress decided not to carry\nforward this language is because the question of\nwhether someone was deported before or after 1952\ndoesn't have a great deal of practical significance at\nthis point in time. But whatever one might think was\nthe actual reason for Congress's failing to carry\nforward the language, I don't think that you can draw\nany negative inference from Congress's failure to carry\nforward that language, at least certainly not the\nnegative inference that Petitioner wants to draw. In\nfact, the negative inference that one would draw, if\none were going to do so, is that the section 1231(a)(5)\napplies only to people who were deported initially\nafter 1952. But that sort of negative inference\nwouldn't be of much assistance to Petitioner, or any\nother person, for that matter, that illegally reentered\nbefore IIRIRA, at least as a practical matter, because\neverybody, I think, in that category, would have\nillegally reentered -- or would have been deported\nafter 1952, rather.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that gives the\nother side the -- you know, the benefit of their\nargument. I think what they're arguing is not just\nthat it was deleted, but that it was not replaced by --\nwhether \"before or after,\" and then filling in the date\nof IIRIRA, rather than the date of the INA. I have --\nnobody thinks that they would leave in June 27, 1952,\nbut why wouldn't they have substituted, for that, the\ndate of this new legislation, the date of IIRIRA? I\nthink that's the point he's making.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't there something to\nthat?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- it's -- there's\ncertainly not enough there to make the argument that\nhe's making, I don't think, because what was -- what\nCongress did was to replace that provision with utter\nsilence. And from that utter silence, I don't think\nthere's any way to read into it that Congress meant for\nthe applicability of section 1231(a)(5) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just getting rid of old\nlanguage that was no longer --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or intentionally not\nadding new language.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. I don't think\nthere's any way to read into it the inference that\nCongress meant to hinge the applicability of section\n1231(a)(5) on IIRIRA's enactment date. There never was\na proposal on the table to hinge section 1231(a)(5)'s\napplicability on IIRIRA's enactment date. The only\npossibility was to keep the old provision in the\nstatute books unaffected, and the decision not do that\ndoesn't have the negative inference that Petitioner\nsuggests.\nIf the Court has no more questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Gossett, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GOSSETT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. GOSSETT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nOnly a few points I want to make.\nThe first is that illegal reentrants'\nreasonable expectation that they might grow into\nrelief, as Mr. -- the Chief Justice said, not only is\nreasonable, but has a statutory basis. Suspension of\ndeportation and cancellation of removal, by their very\nterms, are only available to aliens who were illegally\npresent in the United States for the relevant time\nperiod, and, therefore, these forms of relief\nspecifically exist to -- for such aliens. That people\nhave a reasonable reliance interest in unlawful acts\nover time is also demonstrated by such doctrines as the\ndoctrine of adverse possession, statutes of\nlimitations/laches, et cetera.\nSecond, Justice Breyer, your -- it is the\ncase that were he to have been -- have left after the\nenactment of this Act, he would be kept out for --\ninadmissible for 5 years. That's 8 U.S.C.\n1182(a)(6)(B). Because he had reentered the country\nwithin 5 years of his 1981 deportation, he -- under the\nGovernment's interpretation of that statute, he would\nbe inadmissible for 5 years from -- even if he were to\nre-leave in 1996, he would have been ineligible to\nreenter for 5 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, a person who just leaves\nvoluntarily, having reentered illegally, cannot come\nback for 5 years, no matter what, under 1156(a)(6)(B).\nMR. GOSSETT: The former -- that was repealed\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was repealed.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- in 1996. But, yes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- that would have -- as part\nof IIRIRA -- but if he had waited til IIRIRA took\neffect, then it would have been -- he would have been\nsubject to this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. GOSSETT: -- provision. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGossett. Thank you.\nMR. GOSSETT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n[Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
