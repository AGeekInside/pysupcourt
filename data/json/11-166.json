        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway\nHotel v. Amalgamated Bank.\nMr. Neff.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. NEFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. NEFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is\nwhether a secured creditor must be allowed to credit bid\nwhen its collateral is being sold under a Chapter 11\nplan. The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code\nplainly says no.\nSection 1129(b)(2)(A) provides that a\nChapter 11 plan must be fair and equitable to a secured\ncreditor that objects to it.\nIt then provides three alternatives that the\ndebtor can pursue to satisfy that test. Any one of\nthese three alternatives can be used when assets are\nbeing sold, but only one of them requires the right to\ncredit bid.\nUnder subsection (i), the plan must allow\nthe creditor to retain its lien and receive payments\nover time, with the present value equal to the value of\nits collateral.\nUnder subsection (ii), the plan must allow\nthe creditor to credit bid when its asset is being sold\nfree of its lien.\nBut under subsection (iii), the plan must\nprovide the creditor with the indubitable equivalent of\nits secured claim.\nThe debtors have chosen to pursue a plan --\na plan sale without credit bidding under subsection\n(iii).\nThe plain language of the statute permits\nthat result.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how does one\ndetermine what is the indubitable equivalent of the\ncreditor's claim?\nMR. NEFF: The indubitable equivalent will\nbe determined at the time of plan confirmation, in our\ncase, after the sale has been conducted, although not\nyet approved by the court. So the court will have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the sale --\nsomething -- the sale can't go on without the court's\napproval. I mean, the -- the auction has to have the\ncourt's approval, right?\nMR. NEFF: Well, here's what happens\ntypically: The debtor files a motion, as we did in this\ncase, to approve bid procedures. The court then\ndetermines whether those bid procedures are appropriate\nfor the sale.\nThe sale is then conducted. Then the debtor\ngoes to plan confirmation; and, at the plan confirmation\nhearing, aside from establishing the 16 requirements of\nSection 1129 for a plan to be confirmed, the debtor also\nseeks to confirm the results of the sale.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so what qualifies as\nindubitably equivalent?\nMR. NEFF: The indubitable equivalent must\nbe an amount that is at least equal to the amount of the\nsecured claim. In essence, it's going to be determined\nby what the assets sold for, provided that the sale has\ngenerated the best possible price for the asset.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the -- suppose\nthe creditor thinks that the -- the sale was --\nundervalued the assets, that it -- it wasn't the\nequivalent?\nMR. NEFF: The creditor has an opportunity,\nat the plan confirmation hearing, to raise any issue\nwith regard to the sale process, with regard to the\nauction that occurred -- has the opportunity to raise any\nother issue that may bear on the price that is received\nat the sale that occurs.\nFor instance, it could say, well, they\nconducted this auction, but I have an appraisal here\nthat says the property is worth much more. So this\ncan't possibly be -- my --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't the -- isn't the\nissue who is going to decide whether something is really\nthe indubitable equivalent? Is it going to be the\njudge, which is what you would like? Or is it going to\nbe determined through a particular bidding procedure --\nMR. NEFF: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- namely, where there can\nbe credit bidding, which is what the -- which is what\nthe Respondent would like.\nMR. NEFF: It's going to be the judge, after\nreviewing what happens at the sale. The problem with\nallowing a creditor the right to credit bid under all\ncircumstances is, in a case like ours, we don't believe\nwe will ever get to an auction because no one else will\nshow up.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Respondent\nthought that what the judge would determine would\nindubitably provide the indubitable equivalent, then\nthere wouldn't be an issue here, right?\nThe reason why there's an issue is because\nthey don't think that what the judge will decide will\nindubitably provide the indubitable equivalent.\nMR. NEFF: In this particular instance, I\nwould suggest that the -- the creditor simply does not\nwant the asset sold. It would rather take the asset\nback and hold it for some time period. So it's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that --\nisn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he\ninsisted upon security before giving the loan?\nMR. NEFF: Well, what they bargained for was\nthat the asset be liquidated and all of the proceeds\napplied to their loan. And that's exactly what we\npropose to do under our sale procedure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're\ndepriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to\nhold on to the asset because he thinks it is, for\nperhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued. Right?\nMR. NEFF: Well, he -- he is denied that\nright under subsection (i), which is our traditional\nreorganization -- internal reorganization provision of\nSection 1129(b)(2)(A).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- did I cut off\nyour answer to Justice Alito?\nMR. NEFF: Well, with regard to the\nindubitable equivalence, clearly, the judge is going to\nmake that determination. But that's no different than\nthe judge making a determination under subsection (i) as\nto what the fair market value of the collateral is for\npurposes of determining the note that the creditor is\ngoing to receive and be paid off over time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could the -- could the\njudge say, when the proposal is made to him, the only\nway I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent\nis to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is\nwhat we always do? Can the judge say that?\nMR. NEFF: If there is testimony provided to\nthe judge that that is the way that will maximize the\nsale proceeds and that, in fact, you can't get\nindubitable equivalence unless you allow credit bidding,\nit would seem to me, under that circumstance, the judge\nwould have that discretion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you're, you're --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It makes no sense to me\nwhat you are saying because, under all circumstances,\nthe credit bid, unless the property is valued higher\nthan the credit bid amount, but then another bidder\ncould do -- could make -- could enter that bid.\nMR. NEFF: Well, the problem is when --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The maximum value always\nhas to be the value of the credit.\nMR. NEFF: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the -- if the -- if\nthe creditor is willing to put it at risk that way.\nMR. NEFF: Your Honor, I would disagree. I\nthink, in a situation like ours, no one else is going to\ncome to bid because creditors who are -- or potential\npurchasers who are looking to buy a hotel have multiple\nopportunities to buy other hotels.\nSo if they know that they are going to show\nup at a sale, where a creditor is owed substantially in\nexcess of what the property is likely to sell for, they\nare not going to spend their time and effort doing the\ndue diligence that is required to acquire or make a bid\non an asset like a hotel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so what's wrong with that?\nI mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars. For the\nmillion dollars, he got an interest -- a secured\ninterest in a piece of property. And that property is\nworth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth -- less\nthan a million, and he says that's the deal.\nI -- I have a secured interest in this; I\nwant the property. Now, you are better off because you\ncan stretch out the payments over time, and maybe you\ndon't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't\nsee anything unfair about saying, give him the property\nif he wants it.\nMR. NEFF: That, in essence, would be\ndenying Chapter 11 relief to a host of debtors where\ntheir collateral is worth --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, in accordance with\n(i), (ii) and (iii). I mean, I'm not saying skip those.\nMR. NEFF: What -- the problem is you are\ncutting off the bankruptcy process, really, before it\nhas --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand that. I\nmean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, I read\nthis makes perfect sense. What they are trying to do is\nhelp the debtor a little, without mucking up the secured\ncreditor's collateral. Choice (i), give the secured\ncreditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on\nit. He has what he had before, and the debtor is better\noff because he can stretch the payments out over time,\nand that's one and two.\nChoice (ii), we give the creditor some new\ncollateral. Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure\nit's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few\nexceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit\nbid. So he has it within his control.\nChoice (iii), something else which comes up\nin different situations, for example, a creditor who is\nover-secured, see, and -- and they want to sell the\npiece of property. And he says, sure, I will let you\nsell it, but I want something that's the equivalent,\ngive me this other property over here that you own, that\nhas no liens at all. And the judge can look at that and\nsay that's fair. That's what (iii) is basically about,\nas far as I could understand it.\nSo it all makes sense to me. And I don't\nunderstand why you would want to have a rule saying that\n(iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding.\nMR. NEFF: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's the whole thing,\nas I am seeing it at this moment. So I'll give you a\nchance to reply.\nMR. NEFF: Thank you. Your Honor, I don't\nsee subsection (iii) as having the limiting language\nthat it should have if, in fact, it was meant to be\nsomething other than what is in subsection (i) or\nsubsection (ii). There is no language that says, except\nas provided for in subsection (i) or (ii), relief other\nthan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't have the\nlanguage, which is why we have a case. But, I mean,\ntrying to interpret it in a way that makes sense, what\nis wrong with what I said as a way that makes sense? I\nmean, why, since we are trying to give the -- the\ncreditor the indubitable value, at the very least -- the\nbest way to do that would be let the creditor credit\nbid.\nMR. NEFF: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why not? And you can\nread it. You don't have to read it the way that -- that\nyou want. You could read it the opposite way, too.\nMR. NEFF: If you are looking at it from the\nperspective of the creditor saying well, this -- -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm looking at it from\nthe perspective of a bankruptcy system --\nMR. NEFF: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that is trying to get\nsecured creditors what they have their security in,\nwhile giving the debtor the advantage here of being able\nto stretch out his payments.\nMR. NEFF: I agree. And there are other\nparties and interests in -- in a bankruptcy case,\nincluding, obviously, unsecured creditors, that get\nnothing, if the result is all the creditor gets is the\nrelief from the automatic stay to foreclose on the\ncollateral, when you have this great discrepancy between\nwhat it's owed --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how would they get\nanything, anyway? I mean, your brief suggests that,\nsomehow, there are these unsecured creditors in the mix\nwho are going to receive some benefit if your\nunderstanding of this statute goes forward.\nBut, you know, in a circumstance like this,\ndoesn't the secured creditor either get the property or\nget the money from the property, and the unsecured\ncreditors are out of the mix regardless?\nMR. NEFF: Well, in our particular instance,\nobviously, there are some senior liens that would be\npaid, including things like mechanic's liens and real\nestate taxes. There are other costs that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But those are -- those\ncontinue forward. So even if the secured creditor got\nthe property, there would be mechanic's liens on the\nproperty, isn't that right?\nMR. NEFF: That's true, although resolving\nthem pursuant to a plan is usually a better resolution\nfor them, by providing more certainty and -- with regard\nto the result, and a more quicker resolution, usually,\nas opposed to being relegated only to State court to\nfight them. In our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Neff, can -- are\nyou done? I'm sorry. I didn't want to stop your\nanswer.\nMR. NEFF: I was only going to say that, in\nour particular instance, the stalking horse had agreed\nover a future time, after it obtains the property, to\nprovide for recovery to general unsecured creditors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- let's look at the\ntext. Little (ii) provides for exactly what you want to\ndo here. What you want to do under (iii) is precisely\nwhat (ii) says, except you want to eliminate, subject to\nSection 363(k) of this title, right?\nDoes it -- does it make much sense for a\nprovision to say you can do it three ways: number (i);\nnumber (ii), you can have this sale subject to credit\nbidding; and number (iii), after -- after saying that,\nspecifically, oh, you can have this sale, not subject to\ncredit bidding?\nThat's -- that's not a very sensible\nstatute. Why -- why go through that -- that problem\nof -- of saying number (ii), if you could have left it\nto number (iii) anyway?\nMR. NEFF: Subsection (ii) provides that, if\nyou allow credit bidding, regardless of the price that's\nachieved, that that is deemed to be fair and equitable\ntreatment of the secured creditor's claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's just not true\nfrom what you just said, meaning what you just said is\nthat the buyer, obviously, is paying other things off,\nand by definition, he's deducting that from the purchase\nprice. No one gives a purchase price for a piece of\nproperty and agrees to pay something else and gives the\nhighest price for the property once they've done that.\nSo what you're asking for is permission for\nthe debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and\nthat's what I thought a secured interest prevented.\nMR. NEFF: With regard to Justice Scalia's\nquestion, all I was trying to point out is that, in\nsubsection (ii), regardless of the -- the price that is\nachieved as long, as you allow the secured creditor the\nright to credit bid --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why doesn't he get --\nMR. NEFF: -- that's the fair and\nequitable --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why doesn't he get\neverything that the buyer is promising to everyone else?\nFor that, indubitably, is part of the price because he\nis giving out money to others. That's part of the value\nof this property. So why isn't the creditor -- the\nsecured creditor, entitled to all of the proceeds from\nthe property?\nMR. NEFF: The secured creditor will get all\nthe proceeds from the property.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No -- with -- with\nsales price, but not from all the payments.\nMR. NEFF: With -- right. With regard to\nthe pavements that are in the future, those are after\nthe -- the sale would be consummated to the stalking\nhorse bidder.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still haven't\nanswered my --\nMR. NEFF: There are other benefits that the\nsecured creditor -- that will get, that will increase\nthe -- the price that is received by having sold the\nproperty in bankruptcy. For instance, when you sell\nthrough a plan, you avoid the payment of transfer taxes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. NEFF: So, clearly, to the extent that\nthe transfer taxes being saved are in an amount that\nexceeds what ultimately goes to the unsecured creditors,\nthese --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still haven't\nanswered my question. If the buyer had money that he's\nwilling to give up to others, why isn't he putting it in\nthe purchase price? Why isn't that part of the price?\nMR. NEFF: It would be our obligation to\nshow at confirmation that the creditor is paying the top\ndollar for the asset. If the creditor desires to pay a\nbonus or a premium on top of that, we would have to show\nthat, nonetheless, that the secured creditor is\nreceiving the indubitable equivalent and either have to\nshow by argument that -- a savings on the transfer tax\nor some other way that this is not causing the secured\ncreditor to not receive the indubitable equivalent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could -- could you\nexplain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit\nbid, if property is sold during the plan, but not\npermitting it when it's sold at plan time?\nMR. NEFF: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that delay the\nbankruptcy in every situation? I can't actually\nunderstand what benefit, other than delay of the\nbankruptcy process, that would occasion.\nMR. NEFF: Is your question why we always\nhave it under Section 363, but not under the plan?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-hmm.\nMR. NEFF: Section 363 allows the sale of\nproperty outside the ordinary course of business during\na bankruptcy case. It can be done as quickly as on\n21 days' notice. So it can be done on a very truncated\nbasis, or even more quickly if the debtor can show that\nthere is cause, some reason to have an even faster sale.\nThere is no requirement that you show that any of the\nplan requirements in Section 1129 must be met.\nSo there are good reasons to have this\nprotection for the secured creditor when you are selling\nunder Section 363 outside of a plan context that don't\nnecessarily exist when you are selling in the course of\na plan because a plan takes a much longer time period,\nusually at least 2 months' notice, if not much longer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Neff, don't you feel\nsorry for the United States? The United States is often\nin the creditor situation, and the United States cannot\ncome up with cash.\nAre they going to run to Congress and get an\nappropriation for each -- each security case it has?\nWhat -- what do you propose we do with the United\nStates? The United States just can't take any security\ninterests anymore or what?\nMR. NEFF: Well, no, I don't think that that\nis the case. And I did see that in their brief, and I\ndon't know the extent that, in practice, that actually\noccurs because, for instance, they pointed out the SBA\nloans. Those are typically guaranteed loans. So there\nwould be a motivation, at least by the principals of the\ndebtor, to maximize the return to the SBA.\nBut as far as them not being allowed to\ncredit bid, there are -- they have the opportunity to\nhave a greater voice in the sale process. They can\nseek --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't understand.\nMR. NEFF: Well, they can seek from the\nBankruptcy Court a greater role when the asset is being\nmarketed for sale to ensure that they are receiving top\ndollar on their claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't have that\nright now? They don't have that right now?\nMR. NEFF: Well, when we sell assets, the\ndebtor typically has the control over how it's going to\nbe marketed and sold. They may give some input rights\nto the secured creditor, but they're usually not going\nto give the secured creditor the veto power over how to\nconduct the sale.\nBut I -- I would suggest that, when you have\na situation with a creditor that truly cannot bid cash,\nthat -- that there would be an opportunity to impress\nupon the judge that they need to have a greater role\nwhen you are actually marketing and selling the\nproperty.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Neff, can I understand\nhow your system would actually work in practice?\nSuppose you have an -- an auction, and there is -- the\ntop value was $500. And then you have the secured\ncreditor, let's say, is in the position of the United\nStates and comes in and says, we couldn't credit bid,\nbut we -- excuse me -- we couldn't pay cash, but we\nthink it's $750.\nMR. NEFF: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, now, the court has to\ndecide whether it's $500 or $750, after the auction has\ngone forward. What happens?\nMR. NEFF: The court is going to review the\nprocess to actually sell the asset -- you know, who\nwas -- where was it marketed, who knew about it, who\nshowed up at the auction, how many bids were made --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now, let's say the\ncourt says, You know, I think that the government is\nright; it's really $750. But you've already had a sale.\nMR. NEFF: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and you've sold it\nfor $500.\nMR. NEFF: There has been no closing. The\nclosing doesn't occur until the plan confirmation\nactually occurs. And, in fact, that's how you would do\nit after this Court's ruling in 2008.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But wouldn't the court\nalways say, when -- when it's confronted with this\nsituation, the government comes in, and the court says,\nyes, well, you know, I -- I guess that that price is\nprobably so low because nobody could credit bid. I\nmean, wouldn't that always be a -- a frailty of\nwhatever -- whatever price it sold for? Wouldn't it\nalways be?\nMR. NEFF: No, because you are going to have\nsituations where creditors -- secured creditors will\ncredit bid amounts that have no relationship to the fair\nmarket value, what we call, for instance, loan-to-own\nlenders, where their only interest is actually getting\nthe title to the property. So you are going to have\nsituations that -- where the credit bid does not equate\nto market --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that might be, but --\nyou know, it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to\nfigure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or\nfor credit, you are going to get more bids and higher\nbids than -- than if you allow them to bid for cash\nonly.\nMR. NEFF: The problem is, when you are\ndealing with larger assets, like what we are dealing\nwith, you are not going to get a sophisticated buyer to\ncome in to bid against a lender that can credit bid,\nparticularly in a situation like our case, where the\nlender has said, I simply want the property back.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That just means that you\ncan't find a buyer who is willing to pay that much.\nMR. NEFF: Well, we believe that -- that\nsubsection (iii) allows us to show that the -- the\nsecured creditors receiving the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You said -- look, in subsection\n(iii), if it applies here -- I assume there's -- suppose it\ndoesn't apply here. There is a safeguard against having\nno bidder.\nBidders who would bid more than what the\ncreditor thinks it's worth, the creditor will want them\nin this. And if they -- he doesn't want it in, it's\nbecause he thinks it's worth more in his own hands. So\nwhat's the problem?\nBut there is a problem the other way. The\nproblem the other way -- and I'm not saying it's this\ncase, but there are -- is that the insiders say to the\nstalking horse, we would like you to put this up at a\nlow price and give us a job. And if they keep the\ncreditor out, well, that's a big incentive.\nAnd they are the ones who know what a hotel\nis worth, the judge doesn't know, and there is always\nleeway. And so that -- that was worrying me about this\nfact pattern. You want -- you want to get rid of my\nworry?\nMR. NEFF: Yes, I do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Good.\nMR. NEFF: The bankruptcy judge sees this in\na variety of cases, just the natural tension that you\nhave in a bankruptcy, individuals who may be\nself-interested, yet they are supposed to be fiduciaries\nfor the estate. It's part of our roles as lawyers to be\nthe fiduciaries as well.\nOur particular instance, it's not a concern\nbecause the property is being marketed to a wide array\nof people. There's no requirement that they keep the\nmanagement company, and there's every opportunity for\nany other hotel company to come in -- or any other\nstrategic buyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know, but the concern was -- I\ngather there is no other bidder, you have said. You've\njust found the stalking horse. You agree to pay the\nstalking horse a million and a half dollars, in case he\ndoesn't get it. And then the people from the inside are\nbeing hired by the stalking horse, if he wins.\nMR. NEFF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm not -- I'm sure\nthey are acting very honestly. But you would have to\nsay, in such a situation, that there is an incentive to\ntry to value everything on the low side by the debtor to\nmake sure that stalking horse gets the property. And\nthat incentive is destroyed -- or at least doesn't work,\nif you allow the creditor bid.\nMR. NEFF: Interestingly, the process\nactually works a little different than that.\nYou -- Debtors will go out -- and their\nfinancial advisers will actually go out and try to\nmarket the ability to be the stalking horse, to actually\ntry to get the best stalking horse bid.\nIn this particular instance, what we got was\nthe -- ultimately, the $55 million. We are confident\nthe property, ultimately, will sell for more.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When this procedure is\nfollowed, how often does a buyer, other than the\nstalking horse, obtain the property?\nMR. NEFF: I don't know from a statistical\nbasis -- and, you know, a stalking horse, if they have\nthe -- the -- a break-up fee, they have that built-in\ncushion. And in our case, I would point out the judge\nhad not yet approved the break-up fee, but it was a\nstandard 3 percent of the -- of the bid price. So I\ndon't know what -- what percentage it is, and -- you\nknow, from my own experience --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't realize the judge\nhad to approve -\nMR. NEFF: The stalking horse?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. NEFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The judge has to approve\nthe stalking horse?\nMR. NEFF: That's part of the bid\nprocedures.\nAnd buyers -- more sophisticated buyers --\nand when you deal with bigger assets, they're used to\nthe process being this way, that there is going to be a\nstalking horse and that there is going to be some sort\nof protection.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The vast majority of\nbankruptcy courts have permitted credit bidding in these\nsituations. So if the vast majority of bankruptcies\nhave stalking horses, then the norm is working, without\nus having to rule in your favor.\nMR. NEFF: I would say the vast majority of\ncases occur under Section 363, where there is no\nquestion, because of 363(k), that there is the right --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And stalking horses\nstill come in. So it's not as if the 363(k) procedure\nis failing in maximizing prices.\nMR. NEFF: The -- the major -- that is true.\nThe major difference is that a sale, under Section\n363(k), almost invariably, the secured creditor\nsupports, so there is no question, but that there is\ngoing to be a transaction occurring, whereas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- say it again? I\ndidn't -- I didn't understand that.\nMR. NEFF: When you are selling under\nSection 363, because of 363(k), there must be a right to\ncredit bid; and, in most situations, the secured\ncreditor wants the assets sold when you are doing a\nSection 363 sale. So there is no question, in the minds\nof a buyer, but that there is going to be a transaction.\nAnd there is a reason to spend your time and effort\nlearning more and doing due diligence about the asset.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- Well, this\nis a case, though, where you would not want the asset\nsold. In other words, looking at it, he thinks, for\nparticular, unusual situations, this is vastly\nundervalued; I am holding an asset that is going to\nappreciate if I hold onto it. So he doesn't want the\nasset sold.\nMR. NEFF: That's correct. And -- and it's\nour belief that the Bankruptcy Code provides the\nability, in subsection (iii), to conduct the sale and\npay the secured creditor the indubitable equivalence of\nits claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what -- what is\nthe doubtless equivalent of his claim? Measured by the\ncurrent market conditions? Or does that include some\npremium, based on the assumption that it's going to\nincrease in value over some period?\nMR. NEFF: It's going to be measured by the\ncurrent market conditions, but to the extent that the\nsecured creditor brings in an appraisal, that will\ninvariably be based on what the projections are going to\nbe and -- and take that into account.\nSo if I could reserve the remainder of my\ntime?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Maynard?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSecured creditors bargain for the right to\nbe repaid in full or, if not, to foreclose and take the\ncollateral that secures their loan.\nWhen a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan is going\nto cram down a plan over the objection of a secured\ncreditor, Section 1129(b)(2)(A) gives the secured\ncreditor the ability to protect those rights, regardless\nof the proposed treatment of its collateral.\nSpecifically, when the plan proposes, as\nhere, to sell the collateral, free and clear of the\nsecured creditor's liens, and give the secured creditor\nnothing but the proceeds from that sale, clause (ii)\nentitles the secured creditor to bid what it is owed in\nthe absence of cause to preclude it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or -- or he is\nentitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his\nclaims. You really do just kind of elide the fact that\nthe statute says, \"or.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. We give full\nmeaning to the \"or.\" We don't dispute that these are\nthree alternative ways to cram down a plan. The\nquestion here is or what? And the question is the scope\nof the alternatives and in which circumstances they\napply.\nAnd, here, Congress turned its attention to\nprecisely the situation at hand and determined what the\nrequirements were, but not just the requirements for a\nsale free and clear. It's not like clause (ii) says, if\nyou sell it free and clear and you allow credit bidding,\nthen that's one way to go. It's not just the\nrequirement of credit bidding. It also sets forth the\nonly exception to credit bidding. And Petitioners'\nreading would read clause (iii) to be a much bigger\nexception.\nNow, Petitioners here tried and failed in\nthe Bankruptcy Court to prove cause, and they don't\nappeal that. So they are trying to create a much bigger\nexception to the exception Congress allowed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They tried and failed to\nprove what?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Cause.\nMS. MAYNARD: Your Honor, cause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Cause.\nMS. MAYNARD: So under -- we reprint -- the\n1129 clause (ii) is on 20a in the red brief at the back.\nAnd it -- it provides: \"For the sale, subject to\nSection 363(k) of this title, of any property that is\nsubject to liens securing such claims free and clear of\nsuch liens.\" And that refers you to 363(k), which is\nalso at the back of our brief.\nAnd 363(k) provides that, \"Unless the court\nfor cause orders otherwise, the holder of such claim may\nbid at such sale; and if the holder of such claim\npurchases such property, such holder may offset such\nclaim against the purchase price of such property.\"\nSo my point is clause (ii) is not just, if\nyou let them credit bid, then that's one way to go to\nfair and equitable. It's you must let them credit bid,\nunless cause is shown. And they tried in the Bankruptcy\nCourt, Justice Scalia, to prove cause. And the district\ncourt found against them on that point, and they don't\nappeal it. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your friend\non the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address\ndifferent ways of protecting the secured creditor. (ii)\nis procedural, right? You can go through these\nprocedures, and you can cram down, so long as you are\ngoing through these procedures, which include credit\nbidding.\nOr you can cram down if you ensure that he\nreceives the indubitable equivalent, a substantive\nprotection. What is wrong with that reading?\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think that's a fair\ncharacterization of the three clauses, Mr. Chief\nJustice, because all three of the clauses have both\nprocedural and substantive components. And essentially,\nwhat Petitioners seek to do here is exchange their\npreferred procedure, which is a sale without allowing us\nto credit bid, followed by a judicial determination of\nwhether whatever number that sale produces is high\nenough to be our secured claim.\nBut the whole point is, if the secured\ncreditor is willing to bid one more dollar of what it's\nowed at the sale, that is the value of our secured\nclaim. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that, really,\nthe heart of your argument is that the real value of\nthis property is greater than the value that you think\nthe Bankruptcy Court would assign to it, if this were\ndone under subsection (iii)?\nMS. MAYNARD: That is definitely the fear,\nJustice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why? Why do you have that\nfear?\nMS. MAYNARD: Because valuations are\ninherently uncertain, and Congress knew that. And in\nthis Bankruptcy Code, Congress tried to move away from\njudicial valuations for precisely that reason.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But doesn't clause (i)\ndepend upon a judicial valuation? In clause (i), the\nCourt has to say, what is the present value of your\nproperty, so that it knows what the right income stream\nis.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true, Justice Kagan.\nBut, if you proceed through clause (i), the code\nprovides a secured creditor with a different protection\nagainst undervaluation. So the whole code structure is\nset up to protect the secured creditor against the risk\nof undervaluation of its claim. And that's the Section\n1111(b) election. So Section 1111(b) election allows\nthe secured creditor who is undersecured and is afraid\nthat their -- their value of their property will be\nmisvalued in a clause (i), to elect to have their entire\nface value of their claim treated as secured.\nSo here, the lenders are owed more than\n$130 million. If they were to proceed under clause (i),\nthe lenders would have the option to have that whole\n$130 million treated as secured. And that would be the\nvalue of the secured claim.\nAnd, under clause (i), yes, we would then be\nsubject to the judicial determination of the present\nvalue of whatever a note paying out $130 million would\nbe, but two protections we would have. They wouldn't be\ndetermining the principal. The principal -- the face\nvalue of the note would have to be $130 million; and the\nlien that we would retain would be $130 million.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How about in subsection\n(iii), where it talks about substitute collateral?\nThat's completely a judicial valuation, isn't it?\nMS. MAYNARD: That would be true, but I\nthink, in that situation, we would also have the option\nto make the 1111(b) election. And, therefore, they\nwould have to substitute collateral that would be up to\nthe $130 million mark. So it's true -- and it's true\nthat Congress did leave this other, but it is an other.\nAnd I think -- I think another way to --\nanother point to make that clear is the fact that clause\n(ii) expressly has a role for clause (iii), and it\ndoesn't come into play until after the sale at which the\nsecured creditor gets to credit bid. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is it about the\nauction -- what is it about the auction process that you\nthink is likely to produce or creates an -- an\nunacceptable risk of producing a valuation that is --\nthat is too low? Is it because of this -- the use of\nthe stalking horse or -- or what is it about the\nprocess?\nMS. MAYNARD: If the secured creditors\naren't able to come in and bid their credit and if the\nsecured creditors can't, as is a real risk, raise enough\ncash to bid the amount of their credit in cash -- and,\nin some instances, as with the government, they're -- they\ncan't -- they actually can't.\nBut, in a lot of these complicated loans,\nthere are multiple lenders, and it would be very\ndifficult to come up with the money to put in. And they\nare, therefore -- you are taking out of the marketplace\none of the most knowledgeable bidders about this\nproperty. And there is no good reason to do that.\nThese -- it's not like they are bidding funny money.\nThey -- they have already put in $142 million.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there is,\nof course, a good reason, which is consistent with the\npolicy of the Bankruptcy Code, which is you do want to\nlook out for the other creditors as well. And if the\nsecured creditor is getting, indubitably, the value of\nthis security, why don't you weigh in the balance at\nleast the interests of -- of the other creditors?\nMS. MAYNARD: There will be no cash for\nanyone junior to these creditors, unless these creditors\nare paid in full, regardless of whether everyone bids in\ncash or we bid in credit. This property is well under\nwater. There -- there is no equity in it. The secured\nlenders have lent them 142 million --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe in this\nparticular case, but that's not going to be true in\nevery case, and we are asked to issue a ruling that is\ngoing to apply in every case.\nMS. MAYNARD: In every case where the\nproperty is under water, there will be -- in every case\nin which the secured creditor has a lien on the\nproperty, the secured creditor takes first. So until\nthe -- so underwater or not, until the secured creditor\nis paid --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but\nthe whole premise of why this problem arises is that the\nsecurity is worth a lot less than -- than it was,\nobviously, when it was -- was purchased. Or a lot less\nthan -- a lot less than the claim that it was meant to\nsecure.\nMS. MAYNARD: Everyone agrees that the\nproperty is under water, but it's important to note that\nthe valuations in this case that have been filed in the\ndistrict court, in conjunction with the relief from the\nstay, the appraisals are different by tens of millions\nof dollars, what the property is worth.\nAnd if you allow that to go to a judge, to\ndecide whether it's enough, that's an inherently\nuncertain process. And -- you know, judicial valuation,\nthe -- the court -- tens of millions of dollars, the\njudge could decide, and it might not be a fact that we\ncould overturn, if that goes to a fairly erroneous finding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- I was just\nguessing before, but, I mean, if you're right, what is\nthe (iii) -- the indubitable equivalent, what kind of\nsituation does that come up?\nI mean, I was guessing it would come up,\nmaybe an over secured creditor, they want to -- they\nwant to sell the property, and he still wants his\nsecurity, and they have to put in equivalent property\nthat wasn't mortgaged, but I was just guessing.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what is it\nreally -- what is it really used for, in your opinion?\nMS. MAYNARD: The legislative history,\nJustice Breyer, suggests two meanings for it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMS. MAYNARD: Two examples. And that's what\nyou see in the case. There aren't very many clause\n(iii) cases. There will be many more, if this Court\nholds that this is permissible.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I'm sure.\nMS. MAYNARD: But that -- there aren't very\nmany clause (iii) cases. And they abandon --\nabandonment of the collateral. So, in other words, they\ncould decide just to turn all of the collateral over,\nand that would be the indubitable -- that would be res\nipsa, our secured claim. I mean, that -- the -- we have\ncollateral in everything they own, the hotel, the\ngarage, all of the proceeds.\nOr, as Justice Kagan was suggesting, some of\nthe cases involve providing a substitute lien. But the\ncourts are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I was thinking.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- courts are very hesitant to\ndo that. And it would have to be really -- because it\nis -- you know, you are stripping our lien. You're\nsupposedly giving us an equal lien. So -- you know,\nmaybe if you can imagine -- maybe if these creditors\nowned the airport at the Dulles -- you know, a hotel at\nthe Dulles Airport and a parking garage, and one could\nsay it's exactly the same risk factor and everything,\nand we're going to swap that in for this. But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what\nthe -- what's the purpose -- if you permit credit\nbidding, why do you go through the sale at all, if it's\nalways -- if the credit is always going to be higher\nthan the value? Why don't you just turn over the\nproperty under (iii)? What -- why do you -- why do you\ngo through the sham of a sale?\nMS. MAYNARD: It's not a sham,\nJustice Sotomayor, because the creditor -- secured\ncreditors don't often want to run a hotel and parking\ngarage. They may not want the property. So what they\nare interested in doing is maximizing the value, getting\nback as much as they can of the money that they --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it is the stalking\nhorse dance? At what point do they credit bid until\nthey get the highest price from someone else and then\nlet that other person have it, is that it?\nMS. MAYNARD: That's definitely one of the\nstrategies. And if they -- so they -- so what clause\n(ii) allows a secured creditor -- it allows the secured\ncreditor to choose whether it takes its property, which\nwas the right it had prebankruptcy, or whether it's\nenough. But if you leave it to their system -- and\nhe's -- I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When do you think, under\n363(k), what's good -- what would constitute or has\nconstituted in the case law good cause not to permit\ncredit bidding? What situations have arisen under\n363(k), where a court has found good cause?\nMS. MAYNARD: The cause cases include\nmalfeasance of the creditor in some way --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What --\nMS. MAYNARD: Malfeasance of the creditor in\nsome way. Or whether there might be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does a creditor\ncommit malfeasance?\nMS. MAYNARD: I'm sorry. I can't remember\nany specific examples.\nBut another instance -- and it's actually\none that -- that goes to something Justice Kagan asked\nearlier, which is -- is -- when there's some dispute\nabout priority or whether there might be senior liens.\nSo, in this case, the -- the bankruptcy\njudge provided at 44(a) and 45(a) -- because there --\nthere are some real estate taxes that would be senior to\nour liens, and there's a debate about whether the\nmechanic's liens are senior or not.\nAnd so the bankruptcy judge provided that --\nthat -- that, here, it would be appropriate for us to\neither put up cash, in that amount, the amount of the\npotentially senior liens, or to offer -- you know, some\nsecurity to cover those, in the event that they turn up.\nAnd that is an example of cause. And that is --\nclearly answers the concern that there may be others.\nNo one junior to these creditors is going to\ntake anything. And all making us cash bid would do,\nassuming the secured creditors are able to come up with\nthe cash to bid in this amount, would be to endless --\njust to pointlessly cycle money into the estate, and\nthen, if we're the winning bid, through the estate and\nback to us, at the risk of their siphoning off the money\nthat really shouldn't go to anyone else because we\nhave -- the cash collateral is these secured\ncreditors' -- the hotel and the parking garage are all\nthese secured creditors' collateral.\nNow, the Petitioners say this is going to --\nif you let the secured creditors bid, this is going to\nchill credit bidding. Well, they tried to prove that in\nthe bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court, at pages\n43(a) and 44(a), rejected that as a matter of fact.\nBut, anyway, as a matter of theory, their\nproposal -- who would bid in their proposal? Their\nproposal is you do the due diligence, you have to prove\nyou have the money, you put up the bid, and then at the\nback end, you know that the secured creditor is going to\nbe able to come in and tell the bankruptcy judge, I\nwould have bid more with my secured credit. So anyone\nwho bids knows that there's the potential that it's all\ngoing to be a waste of time.\nAnd then how do you do it over at that\npoint? Once everybody has shown their hand, put their\nbids in, what, are you going to take a mulligan after\nthe -- after the bankruptcy court says, no, they're not\ngetting their indubitable equivalent because I find they\nwould have bid more in their security?\nWell, that's just -- that -- who's going to\nbid in that situation?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does it -- how\ndoes it work in practice? Is this something that is\nsubject of extensive negotiation? The secured creditor\nsays, well, I'm interested in bidding in a credit bid,\nbut I appreciate that that's going to make it difficult\nfor you to get cash.\nAnd you've got these unsecured creditors who\nwould want -- and so, what? I'm not going to credit\nbid, so long as -- or I will only credit bid up to this\nparticular amount; or let's sit down and work out a\ndeal, negotiate over exactly how we're going to handle\nmy security. Is -- is that really how it happens? Or\nis that not -- or not.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think all those things are\nways that it can happen, Mr. Chief Justice. And,\ncertainly, counsel was distinguishing the --\nduring the plan sale requirement, where he concedes\nthat, if you do a 363(b) sale -- you know, 363(k)\napplies, but he says it's not a problem because you can\nnegotiate.\nThere are actually many negotiations in a --\nin a plan sale context. And it would be odd, I would --\nI would suggest, that you can do a cramdown plan over\nthe secured creditor's objection and have less credit\nbidding rights than you can when you agree to do it.\nAnd so, in the end, there's nothing wrong\nwith the secured creditor coming in and bidding its\ncredit and taking the asset. After all, they already\nput in $142 million. They're owed $130 million. The\ndebtors have no equity in -- in this process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't that be a reason\nfor saying that there's no adequate -- there's nothing\nunder (iii) that would be the indubitable equivalent?\nIn other words, one thing is to say that, if\nyou -- if (ii) -- if you fit into (ii), that's it, you\ndon't go to (iii). Another is to say, well, you can go\nto (iii), but it's most unlikely that there would be the\nindubitable equivalent of allowing credit bidding.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think that latter way\nwould be the better reading of the statute, Justice\nGinsburg, because Congress turned its attention to this\nprecise problem and decided that the best way to protect\nthe secured creditor against the risk of undervaluation\nwas to allow it to -- to bid. And I -- and I think, for\nthe reasons I said earlier, the system that they propose\nis -- is not a workable system or a good system, and it\nwouldn't be good to have there be uncertainty about the\nauction -- about whether or not it was going to\nultimately -- you know, go through.\nAnd as long as the secured creditor is\nwilling to bid at the -- at the auction its secured\ncredit, put its money where its mouth is, that is the\nvalue of its -- of its secured claim, and so it could\nnever be the indubitable equivalent to go under (iii),\nwhere it's not allowed to bid.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The Petitioner suggests that\nthe usual rule that the specific governs, rather than\nthe general provision, doesn't apply in this case\nbecause the specific is not a subset of the general.\nWhat's -- what's -- what's your view about that?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, this Court's never\napplied the rule in that way. And I think the Court --\nit's -- it's always the case that, when the Court's\nlooking at these kinds of problems, that the general\nprovision could be read to encompass what the party\nbefore the Court is seeking to do.\nBut the -- when Congress has set up a\nprecise scheme -- and, here, I think it's important to\nrealize it's not just the requirements, but also the\nexception to the requirements -- and then, also, the way\nthat (ii) is -- refers to (iii), and (iii) doesn't kick\nin until after the sale --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I lost you. I lost you.\nMS. MAYNARD: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just the\nrequirements, but the exceptions to the requirements.\nWhat are you referring to?\nMS. MAYNARD: The for cause.\nSo by reading in 363(k), Justice Scalia,\nit's not only the requirement of credit bidding, but\nalso the only exception.\nBut then also, if I could just elaborate\nthis -- the point about how it refers to clause (iii),\non 20(a) of our brief, we set forth the text. The final\nclause of clause (ii) says that, once the sale goes\nthrough, the liens attach to the proceeds of the sale.\nAnd the treatment of those liens on the proceeds are\ndone under clause (i) or clause (iii) of this\nsubparagraph.\nSo clause (ii) contemplates that there will\nbe some judicial determination of indubitable\nequivalence, but only after the amount of the\nproceeds -- because -- after all, what we're trying to\ndetermine here is the value of the secured claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said, earlier,\nwe have never said that the specific has to be a subset\nof the general. How do -- how would it otherwise be\nspecific and the one general? It seems, if they are not\na subset, then they are alternatives. I don't see how\nthe whole doctrine makes any sense, if the specific is\nnot a subset of the general.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, maybe I misunderstood\nJustice Kagan's question or I misunderstood their point.\nI thought their point was looking specifically at the --\nthe facts of the Speedy Trial Act case and saying\nbecause it's a list and it says, \"includes,\" and then\nthere are subsets under the list, that's how I\nunderstood their argument.\nYes, it's certainly true -- like, take the\nvenue statute case -- you know, the general venue\nprovision clearly covered patent infringement suits.\nBut then there was a specific patent infringement venue\nstatute, and the -- the patent infringement statute\ndidn't say it was the exclusive patent venue statue, and\nthe general venue statute didn't say, \"except as\notherwise provided in the code,\" yet this Court said,\nwell, the patent -- Congress turned its attention to\npatent infringement suits and created this venue. And\nthat's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when we say, our\ndoctrine says the specific controls over the general,\nthe specific is a subset of the general?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, to the extent that I\nthink it's always fair to say that what the party who's\nclaiming they fit within the general does could\ndefinitionally possibly fit within the general. We --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMS. MAYNARD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Harrington?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Big case for the\ngovernment, Ms. Harrington, isn't it?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is a big case for the\ngovernment.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It is a big case for the\ngovernment. As you suggest, the government is in the\nposition of -- that actually many secured creditors are\nin these days, which is that we have constraints on our\nability to cash bid at the sale of our collateral\nthrough a bankruptcy. And the detailed cramdown\nprovisions of Chapter 11 are designed to protect the\nrights of secured creditors.\nThe essence of being a secured creditor, of\ncourse, as the Court has suggested, is that the secured\ncreditor has bargained for the right either to get its\nmoney back or to get the thing that secures its loan, to\nget its collateral.\nAnd the type of sale that is contemplated in\nclause (ii) of Section 1129(b)(2)(A) is precisely\ndesigned to guarantee that the creditor will get the\nbenefit of its bargain.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have got a whole\ncadre of U.S. trustees that, presumably, can look out\nfor the interests of the poor United States.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, in most Chapter\n11 cases, the U.S. trustee doesn't play a role because\nit's a debtor in possession. And so the trustee is not\nin charge of the property of the estate. The debtor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we were\nworried about the situation where it's a creditor.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Where the -- where the\nUnited States is a creditor. That -- that's true. But\nif there's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In those cases, of\ncourse, the trustee's there, right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: The trustee is there. But,\nif the debtor proposes a plan that wouldn't allow the\nUnited States to credit bid at an auction that is\nselling its collateral, then the United States is\nusually out of luck because the Antideficiency Act\nprevents us from bidding cash.\nNow, I would like to respond to one -- one\nsort of assumption that has seemed to permeate the\nconversation here, which is that a secured creditor will\nalways have an incentive to bid the full amount of its\nclaim at an auction of its assets, where the auction is\nsupposed to be free of liens. That is actually not\ntrue.\nAs my friend Ms. Maynard suggested, unless a\nbank is trying to get into the business of running a\nhotel or running whatever business is the collateral,\nthe creditor will only want to take the property if it\nthinks it can make a profit by then turning around and\nselling the property.\nSo if there is an auction, where there is a\ncash bid, and the creditor thinks that the value of --\nthe amount of the cash bid is actually a fair valuation\nof the property, the creditor has no incentive to bid\nhigher than that in credit because it has no expectation\nof getting more money than that when it then takes the\nproperty and turns around and sells it.\nSo allowing the credit bidding won't have\nthe effect of serving as a veto on what would be a fair\nsale price by a cash bidder. The -- the secured\ncreditor's incentive is only to bid up to what it -- up\nto what it views as the value of the property and not a\npenny more because it's not trying to take the property\njust for the property's sake. In most cases, it wants\nto take the property and then sell the property.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, of\ncourse, it could bid up if it thinks that there are\ngoing to be other bidders, right? It has a lot more\nflexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent\nof its security interest.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I mean, it has more\nflexibility because it has already put up its money.\nBut every bidder has that incentive that you suggest,\nwhich is to try to make sure that it's -- to sort of\ngame the system a little bit and -- and -- and make\neverybody put their money where their mouth is.\nBut Congress gave secured creditors a right\nto have a role, where they get to put their money where\ntheir mouth is, any time there is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just begs the\nquestion, Congress gave them a right -- I mean, that's\nwhat we are deciding, right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely. And -- and\nPetitioner is certainly correct, that the phrase\n\"indubitable equivalence,\" an unusual phrase in the\nstatute, that that phrase is broad enough to cover any\ntype of disposition of a secured creditor's claim,\nincluding the sale of property free of liens.\nBut Congress also enacted two much more\nspecific provisions right next to clause (iii). And, in\nthose provisions, number (i), which governs -- governs\nthe retention of liens on -- on collateral, and number\n(ii), which governs the sale of -- the sale of\ncollateral free of liens, there are very specific\nprotections written into clauses (i) and clause (ii).\nAnd this Court's interpretive canon that a specific\nprovision will trump a more general provision, where\nboth could apply, would seem clearly to apply here.\nIf a plan proposes a disposition of a claim\nthat is addressed by a clause (i) or a clause (ii), it\ndoesn't make any sense to allow them to strip out\nprotections that are provided in those clauses by\npurporting to go under the more general standard of\nindubitable equivalence.\nThat is especially true because the type of\njudicial valuation of the property that would take place\nunder Petitioners' type of scheme is not guaranteed to\nmake sure that the creditor gets what it bargained for,\nwhich is either its money or its property, but that is\nexactly what clause (ii), that type of auction, is\nguaranteed to do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reference?\nIn clause (ii), we were just told, the -- the last\nclause refers to \"under clause (i) or clause (iii).\"\nWhat -- what is the reference in (ii) to clause (iii)?\nWhat does that mean?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, the type of sale\ncontemplated in clause (ii) is, essentially, a\nliquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a\nproperty. And so you -- the sale would, essentially,\nliquidate the lien. And then clause (ii) provides\nthat -- that there would need to be a replacement lien\non the proceeds of the sale. That replacement lien\nwould then have to be treated under clause (i) or clause\n(iii).\nI think it's fair to say, in most\nsituations, what happens is that the proceeds of the\nsale are handed over to the secured creditor, which is\nessentially a clause (iii) treatment of the lien on the\nproceeds, in the sense that, if the lien on the proceeds\nis a lien on the pile of cash, if you hand over the pile\nof cash, you're surrendering the collateral that is\nsecuring that lien, which is the classic example of\nindubitable equivalence. That is one of the examples\ncited in the legislative history and in Judge Hand's\nopinion in In re Murel.\nI think one of the assumptions that\npermeates the Petitioners' brief is that valuation -- that\nthe value of collateral is something we can all know and\nagree upon.\nBut valuation is an inherently difficult\nundertaking. And this Court has recognized that, when\nCongress enacted the code in 1978, it shifted the\npreference to move from judicial valuation towards\nmarket valuations.\nAnd, here, Congress, in clause (ii),\nexpressed its view that -- that the type of market that\nwould value this property would include one of the most\ninterested market participants, who is -- which is the\nsecured creditor who has an interest in the property.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, valuing\nproperty is what bankruptcy judges do all the time,\nright?\nMS. HARRINGTON: They -- they definitely do.\nBut I think, here, Congress provided that this would be\na situation where the secured creditor would have a role\nin valuing the property, and even under -- as Justice\nKagan pointed out, even -- I think it was Justice\nKagan -- under clause (i), the judge has a role in\nvaluing the property because we have to determine the\npresent day value of the cash stream that the creditor\nwould be owed.\nBut as judge -- as my friend -- as Ms.\nMaynard pointed out -- maybe you will be a judge some\nday --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HARRINGTON: The creditor in that\nsituation has a role in -- in protecting itself against\nundervaluation because it can make the 1111(b) election,\nretain the full amount of its claim if it wants, and --\nand protect itself going forward.\nI think one way that's important is that it\nprotects -- it prevents debtors from cashing out\ncreditors at a low value, at a point where the -- in the\nmarket where the value of the property is low because\nthey retain the lien for the full amount.\nThe same thing is true here. If this is a\nparticularly low point in the market and the creditor is\ntrying to sell the property at auction -- I'm sorry --\nthe debtor is trying to sell the property at auction,\nthe creditor can come in and take the property and\nrealize any -- any upside down the road.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Neff, you have 4\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. NEFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. NEFF: With regard to the market\nvaluation, we are doing a market valuation, as this\nCourt instructed in the 203 North LaSalle case from\n1999, by having an auction, and, after that auction,\nstill having to prove up that we've given the\nindubitable equivalence by showing what occurred at that\nauction. And, if the lenders would like to bring, at\nthat point, their appraisals and show that we didn't\nachieve that amount, then we are not going to be able to\nsatisfy the indubitable equivalence standard.\nSecondly, with regard to the role that\nsubsection (iii) plays in subsection (ii) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What you just said is, so\nlong as they come in with some appraisals that are above\nwhat -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's\nnot the indubitable equivalent?\nMR. NEFF: If they can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because you've got to have\nat least one appraiser who says it's -- it's worth more.\nIs that all it takes?\nMR. NEFF: Right. The -- the question --\nit's a very high standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indubitable is indubitable.\nMR. NEFF: It's a very high standard. And\nas long as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you have one honest\nappraiser who says --\nMR. NEFF: If it is a creditable appraisal\nand we were unable to achieve that, then we will have a\nvery difficult time satisfying that standard, but the\nprocess will have been allowed to play out, which is\nextremely important because those of us who have done\ndebtor work know how many times a lender doesn't want to\ndo something, and, ultimately, you have a sale or\notherwise some sort of disposition of assets, the price\ngets high enough, and they are willing to go along with\nit.\nSo with regard to the market test --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what happens if you\ngo to the judge and the judge says, there is one higher\nbid, so I can't say it's indubitable? Then what\nhappens?\nMR. NEFF: Then -- then you would have to\nprovide additional consideration to the secured creditor\nto get it to the level that the judge would find it to\nbe indubitable.\nSo it's no different than at any plan\nconfirmation hearing, if you say, judge, my plan is\ndependent upon the interest rate being set at 5 percent.\nThe judge says, well, I find it should be 6 percent.\nYou have to find a way to bridge that gap.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that assumes that you\ncan just pull out a wad of cash from your back pocket,\nbut, mostly, the debtors are not in that position. So\nit just seems like a gigantic waste of time.\nMR. NEFF: It's -- it's more so that the --\nthe purchaser would have to come up with that -- would\nhave to come up with that or find some other way to\nbridge that gap.\nIt's not really a waste of time because,\nagain, you are allowing the process to -- to play itself\nout. Too many times, we see, with secured creditors,\nthey're unwilling to deal with debtors because they have\ngotten them in the particular situation. And then, when\nyou are able to actually have an auction, they are\nsurprised by how high the bidding gets because\nbankruptcy auctions are very fulsome events and -- and\ncreate -- can create quite a lot of bidding that can\nreally generate very high -- high value for the\nproperty.\nAs far as the role that (iii) plays in (ii),\nit's a bit convoluted; but, if you pursue a plan sale\nthrough subsection (ii), you don't have to show\nindubitable equivalence, as long as they are allowed to\ncredit bid. But if, in fact, they don't credit bid or\nthey -- they are topped and you are able to raise cash,\nthat cash must be treated in an indubitable equivalence\nway or in accordance with subsection (i).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm a person\nwho believes that, in the business world, the greatest\nsecurity is just knowledge of what courts will do. And\nwhat the two courts who have agreed with you have done\nis contrary to what the majority of courts have done\nfor -- for the longest time.\nWhat's the value for us upsetting the norm?\nMR. NEFF: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the business\nvalue for upsetting the norm?\nMR. NEFF: With regard to what courts have\ndone for a very long time -- for the 30 years that that\nhas been referenced have been primarily in section --\nwith regard to Section 363 sales, as opposed to plan\nsales. What it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That means, because\npeople didn't think they could do it in plan sales. So\nwhy should we upset the expectation?\nMR. NEFF: It's also difficult, in a\nbankruptcy situation, to keep the case alive long enough\nto get to plan confirmation, particularly if it's a -\nif it's a business that's struggling financially because\nthe secured creditor has an ability to get relief from\nthe automatic stay. So that's why we would have more\nSection 363 sales.\nBut, with regard to the benefit, you look at\na case like Philadelphia -- or a case like the Pacific\nLumber out of the Fifth Circuit, which allowed an entire\nenterprise to be restructured out of a very positive\nsale of the timberlands that would not have occurred if,\nin fact, the Court had required credit bidding because\nthe lender simply would have taken back that one crucial\nasset around which the entire enterprise was\nrestructured.\nSo I think, from a debtor's perspective,\nthat is, obviously, of -- of great --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They could have gone\nunder (i) and -- and given the secured lender what he's\nentitled to, which is a future stream of payment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- please.\nMR. NEFF: They could have gone under (i)\nif, in fact, that -- that the lender would have been\nprecluded from making a Section 1111(b) election and\nalso precluded from credit bidding because credit\nbidding's not required under subsection (i), and an\n1111(b) election does not apply when there is a sale.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
