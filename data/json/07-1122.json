        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 07-1122, Arizona v.\nJohnson.\nMr. Parkhurst.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PARKHURST: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nPetitioner asks that this Court apply the\nprinciples established in Pennsylvania v. Mimms to\nuphold the pat-down search of a vehicle passenger seized\nduring a lawful traffic stop. Mimms established that a\ntraffic stop satisfies Terry's first prong as to\nsuspicion of criminal activity, and it also established\nthat a pat down of a driver is justified if the officer\nhas a reasonable suspicion that the driver is armed and\ndangerous.\nFourth Amendment searches must be\nreasonable, and the pat down in this case was\nreasonable. And it is common -- it's a commonsense\nprinciple that the principles in Mimms also apply to\npassengers in the context of a traffic stop.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear your first\n-- in your opening. Did you say that Mimms established\nthat it's likely that he's armed and dangerous? I\nmissed that.\nMR. PARKHURST: No, no. That's not what I'm\nsaying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sure it wasn't, but I\nmissed what you said on that point.\nMR. PARKHURST: What I said is that Mimms\nestablishes that a pat down is justified in the context\nof a traffic stop if the officer believes that the\ndriver is armed and dangerous.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.\nMR. PARKHURST: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that\nthere's a point in an interaction that begins with a\ntraffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature\nof that interaction is changed so that it's no longer --\nso that it becomes a consensual interaction?\nMR. PARKHURST: That -- yes, Chief Justice.\nThat can happen in a traffic stop. There's no evidence\nin this particular case that there was any kind of\nevolution to a consensual encounter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I should\nrephrase the question. Do you agree that it would be\nunconstitutional for an officer to conduct a pat down\nafter an initial seizure while that same interaction\nstill continues?\nMR. PARKHURST: No, I disagree with that,\nYour Honor. An officer can conduct a pat down any time\nit is reasonable in light of factors that the officer\nmay notice about the individual. If the individual\npresents an immediate danger to the officer or to the\npublic, a pat down may be reasonable under the broad\nFourth Amendment principles, even if this happens to be\na consensual encounter or a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your view, or I\nsuppose the government's view -- well, I'll let the\ngovernment argue for itself. In your view, if the\nofficer is just looking for the man in the gray overcoat\nand he stops someone on the street and says, have you\nseen a man with a gray overcoat, and the person says,\nwell, I saw something like that, can he just suddenly\nspin him around and pat, and pat that person?\nMR. PARKHURST: If the officer possesses\narticulable facts that this person is immediately\ndangerous to that officer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're doing away\nwith the first Terry factor altogether. Do you think\nall you need is reasonable suspicion that the person is\narmed and dangerous? What happened to the reasonable\nsuspicion that a crime has just been committed or is in\nthe course of being committed?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, the first prong of the\nTerry analysis, justice Ginsburg, is whether the\nofficer's action is justified at its inception, and one\nway that it may be justified is if the officer possesses\nsuspicion that criminal activity is afoot. But we also\nknow from other case law that another way the officer's\nactions may be justified is during a traffic stop where\nthere's no criminal activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, for a Terry --\nfor a Terry pat down you don't need, do you, articulable\nsuspicion that the person is armed and dangerous? So\nlong as you have a suspicion of unlawful activity, you\ncan stop the individual and pat down. Do you have to\nhave, in addition to stopping the individual, an\narticulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous?\nMR. PARKHURST: I believe that's what Terry\nsays, that you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Both armed and dangerous?\nMR. PARKHURST: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in your view if an\nofficer was going down the street and he saw an\nindividual as to whom he had no suspicion a crime was\nbeing committed, had been or was about to be, but he\nsaid that guy looks like trouble for anybody who has\nanything to do with him, so he goes up to him and he\nsays, I want to talk to you, and because he has\nreasonable suspicion that the individual looks like\ntrouble, he pats him down. Is that a good pat down?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, he would also have to\npossess articulable reasons that a prudently -- a\nreasonably prudent person would be satisfied with that\nthis person is an immediate danger to him.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The individual gives him --\ngives him mean looks and he has a bulge of something on\nhis hip.\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, that could very well\nsupport a pat down.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are doing away\nwith the first Terry factor. There are two factors\nrecognized: One, reasonable, articulable suspicion that\na crime is afoot; and two, this person is reasonably\nsuspected of being armed and dangerous. Your answer to\nJustice Souter suggests that you don't need the first\none, you don't need to have any suspicion that a crime\nis afoot; it's enough that you reasonably suspect that\nthe person is armed and dangerous.\nMR. PARKHURST: What I'm suggesting, Justice\nGinsburg, is that the first prong of Terry is much\nbroader than just suspicion of criminal activity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in my hypothesis\nthere was nothing that would satisfy the first prong of\nTerry. There is no lawful traffic stop, there is no\nindication that the individual has committed a crime or\nis about to or is doing so. So, so -- so Terry one is\nblank in my hypothesis, and you nonetheless conclude\nthat as a result of dirty looks and the bulge of a\nprobable gun on the hip, the officer can in effect\ninitiate the action with the individual and pat him\ndown.\nMR. PARKHURST: What I'm suggesting, Justice\nSouter, is that in the officer's community caretaking\nfunction the officer is authorized to approach an\nindividual that he thinks is trouble, and in the course\nof asking neutral questions, if the officer believes\nthat this person is immediately dangerous to the\nofficer, then a pat-down would be appropriate in that\ninstance. I'm not --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the officer need --\njustification for a stop, for a Fourth Amendment\nseizure, whether because of a traffic violation or\nbecause of suspicion of criminal activity; and then in\naddition to that, reasonably believe that the person is\ndangerous? I thought that would be -- I thought that\nwas your argument.\nMR. PARKHURST: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In the context of a traffic\nstop, you don't need, as to the passenger and the\ndriver, you don't need suspicion of criminal activity.\nThe person has been seized as a result of the stop, and\nthen if you add on to that the reasonable suspicion of\ndanger to the officer, that would be sufficient.\nMR. PARKHURST: What I'm saying, Justice\nAlito, is that in this particular case we certainly have\na legitimate stop, and under Brendlin we also know that\nthe passenger is seized during a reasonably routine\ntraffic stop until the passenger is released. So what\nwe have here is a presumption that the officer has the\nauthority to control the passenger during the routine\ntraffic stop, and we also have an instance in a traffic\nstop where an officer cannot avoid the individual, be it\na driver or passenger. So in our case it seems like to\nthe easy case where Mr. Johnson and Officer Trevizo were\nplaced in close proximity, she detected things about him\nthat she believed made him a threat to her, an immediate\nthreat, and therefore all we're asking in our case is\nthat she be -- she have the entitlement under the Fourth\nAmendment to pat him down.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Officer Trevizo\nherself testified that she thought the seizure part was\nover. She asked him would he get out of the car, and\nthen she said -- I think she used the word \"consensual\"\nherself, that it was a consensual encounter.\nMR. PARKHURST: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That after the initial\nseizure was over, and then she wanted to question him\nabout gang, his gang affiliations -- and didn't she\ntestify? I seem to remember she did, and she said it\nwas voluntary.\nMR. PARKHURST: She said that he could have\nrefused to get out of the car. There's two things about\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. One is we don't need to credit\nnecessarily the officer's own subjective beliefs as to\nthe -- whether the subject was free to leave or not.\nThe second thing is, we know from Brendlin that unless\nthe officer has given or the individual has asked for\npermission to leave, there's -- there is really no\nrelease. So Officer Trevizo was certainly entitled to\nenter a consensual conversation with Mr. Johnson during\nthe lawful seizure, but there was no indication that he\nwas free to leave. Moreover, even if he reasonably felt\nfree to leave, it's irrelevant to whether he reasonably\nposed a danger to the officer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what you're saying\nis that if there is a stop of the passenger and an\ninterrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say,\nincidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a\npat down?\nMR. PARKHURST: Correct, correct, and\nwhether or not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me there\nis some indication that that's what happened here if you\ncredit the police officer's testimony.\nMR. PARKHURST: Right. Certainly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you can\nhave consent within the context of a stop that has not\nyet ceased.\nMR. PARKHURST: Correct. It would be\nanalogous to, say, a, an inmate in a prison offering to\ngive information to one of the prison guards. There's\nno question that the inmate is still in custody, even\nthough the conversation itself is consensual.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if your view of\nthe law that, if the officer is pretty sure that the\nperson he's having a consensual encounter with has a gun\n-- he could see the bulge or something -- is that\nsufficient or does he have to have some proof that the\nperson is about to use the gun?\nMR. PARKHURST: It would be -- in the\ncontext of a traffic stop because of all the unknowns\nthat an officer must face, a bulge is usually sufficient\nto justify a pat down.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What about just meeting on\n-- on the street, the officer meets the man on the\nstreet and asks him where he's going or something like\nthat, and he sees a -- a bulge in the pocket that\nconvinces the officer he has a gun, but that's all.\nThat's the only evidence of a threat to the officer. Is\nthat enough?\nMR. PARKHURST: In that instance, it may be\nthe prudent course to at least ask whether the person is\narmed. On a -- on a random --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if he says \"yes\"?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, then the officer could\nask something along the lines of whether he has a permit\nto carry a gun. And whether or not the person has a\npermit to carry the gun or is lawfully in possession of\nthe gun, it's a matter of basically the totality of the\ncircumstances whether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but I -- I thought\nyou said that there has to be an articulable suspicion\nthat he is armed and dangerous.\nMR. PARKHURST: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A bulge would not be enough\nto conduct a pat down after a Terry stop, therefore.\nMR. PARKHURST: That's exactly -- exactly\nwhat I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then why should it be\nenough to -- to justify a pat down here?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, because -- well, there\nwas no bulge in this case. However, it's a matter of\nall the factors. It's a weighing of all the factors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand. I weigh\nall the factors, and there's nothing but a bulge.\nMR. PARKHURST: Okay. Well, it's a matter\nof whether you believe that the person is dangerous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the bulge alone\n-- Well, whether I believe? There has to be, you know,\na reasonable basis for --\nMR. PARKHURST: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- an articulable basis for\nthe belief, right?\nMR. PARKHURST: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't see why a bulge\nalone would -- would satisfy.\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, in Mimms it was just a\nbulge in the -- the driver's jacket that justified the\npat down. However, a person may possess a gun lawfully,\nand that person may or may not be a danger. For\ninstance, an off-duty police officer, they often carry\ntheir sidearms with them.\nThey are not going to -- even if another\nofficer knows that they're armed, they don't perceive\nthem as a danger, and therefore no pat down is going to\nensue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have a whole separate\nline of cases apart from the Terry stop cases which\nallow officers to protect themselves by conducting a\nsearch of the surrounding area when they arrest\nsomebody. And that justifies a pat down of the person\nthat they arrest also, doesn't it?\nMR. PARKHURST: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether or not they think\nthat -- that he's about to -- to draw the gun and shoot\nthem.\nMR. PARKHURST: Correct. It's -- it's a\nmatter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that line of\ncases be extendible to this kind of a situation?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, it's a matter of\nduring a traffic stop, Brendlin even says that officers\nmust be able to exercise unquestioned command of the\nsituation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why during a traffic\nstop shouldn't they be able to ensure their own safety\nby -- by patting down the people who have been stopped,\nwhether or not they have an articulable suspicion that\nthey are about to draw and shoot? But that's not what\nyou're proposing, is it?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, what I'm proposing is\nthe -- the standard Terry test. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. PARKHURST: -- the suspicion must be\nthat they're armed and dangerous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why go the Terry\nroute instead of the route that -- that covers search of\nthe area around the person who is arrested?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, I believe that this --\nthe facts of this case fall pretty much under Terry. A\n-- a traffic stop will -- will impose circumstances that\nyou're not going to get in a -- in a normal street\nencounter, because basically an officer -- we presume\nthat an officer has the authority to control any of the\noccupants of a car. And \"control\" means not just\nordering them out as in Mimms and Wilson, but also\nmaking sure that one of the occupants doesn't get behind\nyou while you're dealing with the traffic investigation.\nIt's -- it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When -- when did this\nend? You just said -- you said when the car is stopped\neveryone is seized, the driver and the passengers as\nwell. The seizure ends at some point. Is that when the\ndriver is ticketed and the police cruise off or --\nMR. PARKHURST: That's the normal situation,\nand usually that's the analysis that bears on whether\nthe driver has given valid consent to a search of the\nautomobile or something like that. We -- we must bear\nin mind that a pat-down search is not an evidence\nsearch. This is not a full search. It's just a search\nof the outer clothing for an immediately accessible\nweapon.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Parkhurst --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how did the -- how\ndid the officer come up with the marijuana as well as\nthe gun?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, because once he was\narrested for the gun, then they did a search incident to\narrest.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Parkhurst, I -- I\nseem to be a little confused about the facts of this\ncase. I had the -- remember the testimony that she\nthought the -- that the encounter had become consensual,\nwhich meant that he was no longer -- in her view, no\nlonger under police custody. But are you also saying\nshe also thought he was about to assault her; and,\ntherefore, she was in danger?\nMR. PARKHURST: She did not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There is a substantial\ndifference between being both in danger and saying,\nwell, the arrest was all over.\nMR. PARKHURST: No, she -- she did. She\nbelieved that he posed an immediate danger to her based\non the numerous factors that she cited in her testimony.\nSo she was -- she was afraid. She was afraid from the\noutset, as a matter of fact, because of the way that he\nmade eye contact with the officers.\nHowever, we don't want our officers to avoid\ntheir law-enforcement functions just because they're in\ncontact with a possibly dangerous person.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why had this\ndescended from a -- a seizure to a post-seizure\nconsensual encounter? Why was the seizure over?\nMR. PARKHURST: Well, we're arguing that the\nseizure was not over.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me you're\n-- you're acknowledging that she said that it was a\npurely -- you're not arguing it as based on a purely\nconsensual encounter? I thought that that's what you --\nMR. PARKHURST: No. No, Your Honor. We're\nsuggesting that the seizure had never ended in this\ncase. The Arizona court of appeals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though she said so?\nMR. PARKHURST: Correct, because we don't\nhave to necessarily take her word for that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. PARKHURST: That's a -- that's a legal\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The white light is on. I\ndon't want to -- but your opening argument that you\npresented indicated that a seizure is not necessary.\nYou -- you wanted a further rule.\nMR. PARKHURST: I -- well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the officer believes\nthat a person is armed and might be dangerous, then they\ncan pat down. That's -- that's the rule that you\nproposed, I thought.\nMR. PARKHURST: We believe that that is\ntrue. That's not the rule that necessarily arises from\nthe facts of this case, because we believe that there is\na seizure throughout the entire encounter, and that\nthere is really -- there is no question that, as a\nseized passenger, Officer Trevizo could pat him down.\nAnd unless the Court has any other\nquestions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Heytens.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe decision in this case should be reversed\nfor one of two independent reasons. First, at the time\nthat Officer Trevizo performed this frisk, the Arizona\nCourt of Appeals erred when it held that the seizure\nthat had been caused by the initial traffic stop was\nalready over. This seizure was still ongoing at the\ntime of the frisk.\nSecond, regardless of the answer to that\nquestion, under this Court's decisions in Mimms and\nWilson it is constitutionally reasonable for a police\nofficer to order any occupant out of a vehicle during a\nlawful traffic stop and to frisk that individual if the\nofficer has a reasonable suspicion that that individual\nis armed and presently dangerous to the officer. In\nthis case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that\nthere is a point at which the encounter initiated by the\ntraffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no\nlonger justified?\nMR. HEYTENS: We certainly agree, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that at some point the encounter is over, and\nthat if it is in fact not over, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the\nencounter is -- by \"the encounter is over,\" do you mean\nthat they separate; they're no longer together? My\nquestion is whether or not it's a continuing encounter\nbut transforms somehow in its quality so that the pat\ndown is no longer justified.\nMR. HEYTENS: We agree that at some point a\nseizure can morph into a consensual encounter. We don't\nhave any dispute with that. We would say that the\nfundamental reality of this situation is what the Court\nrecognized in Brendlin, which is that at the time the\ncar pulls over a reasonable person would understand\nhimself to not be free to leave unless and until the\npolice officer says something that makes fairly clear\nthat the seizure is over and he's free to go.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there is\nan argument, anyway, that even though the initial\nseizure is over, the consensual encounter continues.\nAnd at some point the officer, as a result of whatever\nhappens during that consensual exchange, becomes\nconcerned for her safety.\nMR. HEYTENS: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand that's our second argument, which is at the end of\nthe day we don't think it matters whether he's seized.\nBecause whether he's seized or not, this is still a\nroadside encounter with a person who was a passenger in\na vehicle that was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you, suppose\nit's a roadside encounter in which the driver is\nchanging a flat tire and the officer stops and wants to\ntalk to him for a while and then he suddenly thinks,\nwell, maybe this guy's armed. Is it okay for him to go\nahead and search him?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I guess the first thing\nI want to say, Justice Stevens, is that it's not okay to\nthink, maybe he might be armed. The officer has to have\narticulable suspicion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Maybe he has an\narticulable suspicion.\nMR. HEYTENS: Okay. Under those\ncircumstances we think absolutely, and we think your\nhypo --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that any different from\nmeeting somebody on the -- on the street corner?\nMR. HEYTENS: It is different in the sense\nthat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The flat -- my flat tire\nexample.\nMR. HEYTENS: It is different because it's a\nroadside encounter, and this Court has recognized again\nand again and again --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those are roadside\nencounters after a traffic violation.\nMR. HEYTENS: I -- I agree with you, Justice\nStevens, which is why at the end of the day we don't --\nwe think that the officer, in basically those facts,\nshould be able to perform a frisk on the street as well.\nI guess just -- again to say, I don't think the Court\nneeds to reach that issue, because I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't rely at all on\nthe fact this is a traffic stop?\nMR. HEYTENS: We do rely on the fact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: On your second point, that\nis.\nMR. HEYTENS: We think this case is\nsubstantially easier because it's a traffic stop,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it easier?\nMR. PARKHURST: Because this Court has\nrecognized again and -- let me give you the example of\nWilson. Wilson is the case where the Court holds that\nit is per se reasonable for an officer to order a\npassenger to get out of the car.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but those are all\ncases in which there is a violation of law that preceded\nthe activity. I asked you about cases in which there is\nnothing other than the officer's interest in patting\ndown the guy because he thinks he has a gun.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I think\nWilson is highly significant in this regard, because the\nCourt went out of its way in Wilson to point out that\nthere's no reason to suspect a passenger with any\nillegal activity at all. The Court said you could\ndistinguish Mimms on the ground that with regards to the\ndriver you have suspicion that he's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I disagree with that.\nThe holding there was that the passenger was stopped,\nthe passenger was seized, so this was a pat down in the\ncontext of an ongoing seizure.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Kennedy, I guess I\nwould say we disagree with this. The Court didn't hold\nuntil Brendlin that a passenger is seized by virtue of\nthe initial traffic stop. The Court went out of its way\nin Brendlin to say that none of its previous decisions\nhad answered the question of whether the passenger is\nseized by virtue of the original traffic stop. And the\nCourt didn't even identify --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even if that's true,\nwhy don't we accept Mimms with the gloss of Brendlin?\nMR. HEYTENS: We think that Brendlin is of\ncourse absolutely correct, and we think the passenger\nwas seized, and we think fundamentally that's why this\ncase is fairly easy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -- your brief\ngoes much, much further. And I'm looking at page 9\nwhere you say: \"Police have to be able to protect the\nofficer's safety from a person reasonably believed to be\narmed and dangerous whenever the officer encounters that\nperson in a place where the officer has a lawful right\nto be.\"\nI read that to mean if the law -- the\nofficer is on the street, in a pub, any place where he\nhas a lawful right to be, that officer can, on the basis\nof a suspicion of armed and dangerous, pat down, and you\ndon't need the first Terry. It's only -- it's only the\narmed and dangerous.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Ginsburg, we agree\nthat that is ultimately the correct Fourth Amendment\nrule. But what we're saying is that the Court doesn't\nneed to decide whether it agrees with us on this\npoint -- that point, excuse me, to resolve this case,\nbecause there are two very important distinctions\nbetween this case and that one.\nThe first one is that we know that Mr.\nJohnson was seized. This was not a consensual\nencounter. We know under this Court's holding in\nBrendlin that there was a seizure of Mr. Johnson in this\ncase. And the question is whether anything happened in\nthis case to unseize him; and we think that the answer\nto that question is clearly no.\nAnd then the second reason is this Court has\nrecognized over and over again that traffic stops pose\nunique heightened dangers to police officers, and so\nregardless of what the rule is outside the traffic\nstop --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you'd apply the same\nrule if the -- if the officer just stopped to help the\nguy change his tire.\nMR. HEYTENS: We do think that at the end of\nthe day, Justice Stevens, the overriding command of the\nFourth Amendment is that a police officer's conduct must\nbe judged by a reasonableness standard, and we think\nthat overriding command allows police officers to take\nlimited and appropriate steps to protect their own\nsafety.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it, if I\nunderstood your earlier answer, you would extend the\napplication of the rule as you understand it to the\nencounter simply on the sidewalk by a police officer who\nhas no suspicion that the individual he wants to talk to\nhas been, is or is about to commit a crime, but if the\nofficer chooses to initiate the conversation, he then,\nin effect, if he can articulate any suspicion, like\nwe'll say the dirty look and the bulge on the side, he\ncan go ahead and pat down. Is that -- is that your\nview?\nMR. HEYTENS: At the end of the day, Justice\nSouter, that is our view. I think that case is harder\nthan this case, and let me explain why.\nIt seems like the argument on the other side\nis predicated expressly on the notion that unless a\npolice officer has suspicion of crime, he can just avoid\ndangerous people, like any of the rest of us can choose\nto avoid them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if the\nDepartment of Justice has ever taken this position\nbefore?\nMR. HEYTENS: I'm not aware of whether we\nhave had to take this position before, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you whether you\nhave. You don't think they have, do you? It's a rather\nextreme position.\nMR. HEYTENS: I'm not aware of whether we\nhave taken this position or not in any previous case,\nbecause I'm not aware of any case that raises the issue\nthat's raised by the going up to someone on the street\nhypothetical.\nWe have certainly consistently taken the\nposition that in the context of traffic stops it is\nconstitutionally reasonable for police officers to\nperform Terry frisks whenever they have reason to\nbelieve that their safety is in danger. As I was saying\nto Justice Ginsburg, I think -- excuse me, Justice\nSouter, I believe -- I think the problem in the\nhypothetical where the officer goes up to someone on the\nstreet, it's predicated under the assumption that the\npolice officer, like you and me, should just avoid\ndangerous people.\nWe think that's fundamentally wrong about\nwhat the nature of a police officer's job is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's something\nfundamentally wrong probably about that, but the --\nthe -- I think the problem that sort of drives the\nquestioning is that if you extend the rule as far as you\nwant to extend it, we have to take into consideration\nthat the standard of articulable suspicion is the\nstandard that, in practical terms, can pretty well\nalways be met.\nYou can -- you know Benjamin Franklin's\nremark, it's great to be a reasonable person because you\ncan think of a reason for anything you do. And that's\nwhat's driving, at least driving my questions.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I certainly would add,\nJustice Souter, that it has to be a reasonable person.\nIt's not that a police officer can recite some reason.\nIt's whether a reason that a reasonable person in that\nposition would find reasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but what the officer\ncites is going to be a matter of fact, and the facts at\nthat point are gone, they're in the past. And all\nyou've got is the officer saying, you know, this is --\nthis is what I perceived. And maybe you've got the a --\ndefendant somewhere saying, oh, no, it wasn't like that.\nBut in a -- in a situation like that, if articulable\nsuspicion, in effect, can justify a sidewalk pat down\nwithout any articulation of a basis to think crime is\nafoot, then you've got a -- you've got a pretty wide\nopen standard in the real world.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I guess, Justice Souter,\nto the extent you're concerned about that, I would say\nthe same thing is true about whether you have\narticulable suspicion of criminal activity, and the\nCourt has decided that that risk is worth, you know,\ndealing with under the context of that question. So I\ndon't really understand why in principle articulable\nsuspicion of armed and dangerousness is any different.\nI would also say that in this case,\nregardless of whether there will be hard cases, the\ndecision that this Court is reviewing is expressly\npredicated on the view that Officer Trevizo had\nreasonable suspicion Mr. Johnson was armed and\ndangerous. That's on pages 13 and 14 of the petition\nappendix.\nIt is also the predicate of the question on\nwhich this Court grants review. The question which this\nCourt granted review presupposes that she had a\nreasonable suspicion.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Pincus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI think the other side made clear that its\nprincipal argument is that Terry should be revisited and\nthat the two tests that Terry prescribed for a pat-down\nsearch, that there be reasonable suspicion that crime is\nafoot and reasonable suspicion of armed and dangerous,\nshould be revised so that all that is required for a\npat-down search is the second Terry standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- we've\nbeen talking about the officer approaching somebody on\nthe street who has the bulge in his pocket, what if the\nperson with the bulge in his pocket approaches the\nofficer? Can the officer at that point, even if he has\nno suspicion that crime is afoot, conduct a pat down?\nMR. PINCUS: No, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is -- this is\nlike the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to\nwait for the defendant to draw first?\nMR. PINCUS: No, I think the officer can --\nit's -- I think it's important to make clear that the\nsliver of cases we're dealing with here are cases where\nthere is a reasonable suspicion of armed and\ndangerousness but not a reasonable suspicion that\ncrime -- criminal activity is afoot.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in response to my\n--\nMR. PINCUS: If there really is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One moment. In\nresponse to my hypothetical, even though the officer\nreasonably thinks he is in a situation where he could be\nshot, he can't do anything about it, not even a simple\npat down, even though he did not initiate the contact,\nsomebody comes up to him?\nMR. PINCUS: If he reasonably believes he\ncould be shot, Your Honor, then probably there is\nreasonable suspicion of criminal -- that criminal\nactivity may be afoot because he'll have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, let's just\nsay it's like this case: The guy's coming up, he's\nwearing the colors of the Crips gang and he has a bulge\nin his pocket. It's not a crime to wear that type of\nclothing; it may not be a crime to have a bulge in your\npocket; but he nonetheless has a reasonable suspicion\nthat he's being -- he's in a threatening situation, even\nthough he has no basis for thinking that a crime is\nbeing committed.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think this\ngoes a little bit to Justice Souter's comment in the\nfirst part of the argument. These two standards are --\nare somewhat -- are mutually reinforcing, as we discuss\nin our brief. And if, indeed, as here, the State is\nonly arguing armed and dangerousness, and not arguing\nthat criminal activity is afoot, it's clearly putting\nitself at the low end of the armed and dangerous.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- Mr.\nParkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is\nthe equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime\nis the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a\ncrime is afoot. It justifies this stop, and then you\nhave to have something further to justify the pat down,\nbut the car, the seizure of the car and its passengers,\nthat is the equivalent of the first Terry. And why\nisn't that so? It's a stop; it's a legitimate stop.\nMR. PINCUS: I think that you're right,\nJustice Ginsburg, that's the second argument that they\nmake, and our answer to that argument is that we don't\nthink that Mr. Johnson was seized at the time the pat\ndown occurred, as the court of appeals here found. The\nother side seems to ignore the fact that there is an\nactual determination by the court of appeals, looking at\nthe facts of the situation, that there wasn't a seizure.\nAnd so--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can we pursue that for a\nminute. What -- I guess -- we -- we all start with the\ncommon assumption that -- that there was at least a\nlegitimate stop to start with.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And my -- my question which\n-- which goes to who was right about whether the\nseizure, the legitimate seizure had stopped and the\nconsensual encounter had begun, my question is what is\nit beyond the conclusory statement of the officer that\nin effect justifies drawing that conclusion that the\nstop was over?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, a couple of things, Your\nHonor. First of all, the Court has never discussed, but\nin Wilson it actually reserved the question, of what is\nthe duration of the seizure of a passenger.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have -- do we have\nany evidence about duration here?\nMR. PINCUS: We don't have any duration, but\nthe question -- I think an important question is does\nthe seizure of the passenger necessarily in all cases\ncoextend with the seizure of the driver? This stop was\nin an urban area. It might be one thing if it's a stop\non a highway where there's really no place for the\npassenger to go. This was a stop in a -- and where\nthere are concerns about the safety of a passenger who\nis allowed to wander off and the potential liability of\nthe police. Here the stop was in an urban area, and --\nand if the Brendlin says that initially clearly the\npassenger was seized, the question is how long does that\n-- that seizure last?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If in my -- my problem in\nthis case, I guess, in taking your position is, I don't\nthink we have got an evidentiary basis to conclude that\nwhat we start by assuming is a legitimate stop has in\nfact run its course. I don't see how we can draw that\nconclusion. That's what I'm getting at.\nMR. PINCUS: Let me pick up some of the\nfactors we rely on, Your Honor. First, just as a legal\nmatter, the Court has said in Caballes and other cases\nthat the scope of a Fourth Amendment intrusion turns on\nthe purpose. Here we say the scope of the seizure of\nthe passenger should turn on the ability to secure the\nscene. If the passenger is not involved in what -- in\nthe facts that gave rise to the stop -- if it's clear,\nfor example, quickly that the passenger doesn't own the\nvehicle, the reasons that -- the driver owns the\nvehicle, the stop, the basis for the stop relates to the\npassenger -- we don't see what the basis is for, in an\nurban setting at least, for any further seizure of the\npassenger.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, in other words,\nyou -- you are -- I -- I'll be candid with you. I would\nhave started with the assumption, based on Brendlin,\nthat if the stop of the car and its driver also effects\na stop and a seizure of the passenger, that you start\nout with the assumption that the seizure of the\npassenger is going to last for the same duration as the\nseizure of the car and the driver unless you have a good\nreason to draw some line and say, no, it doesn't. And I\ntake it that you are not making that initial assumption;\nam I correct in that?\nMR. PINCUS: We're not relying entirely on\n-- on what I just said. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think you're rejecting\nit, aren't you?\nMR. PINCUS: No, we're not relying -- we're\nrejecting that assumption. We don't rest entirely on\nthe notion that the -- that the seizure of the\npassengers as a matter of law has to end. We think\nthere are special facts here that show that -- that\nsupport the idea that the seizure was over. But I think\none of them --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What are those -- what are\nthose special facts?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, basically there was this\ninteraction separate from the interaction with the\ndriver to the extent the passenger -- Brendlin says the\npassenger, one of the reasons the passenger would feel\nthat he or she is seized is because of his or her\nrelationship to the driver and to the stop here. This\ninteraction proceeded separately.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying -- are you\nsaying if there are a driver and a passenger and two\npolice officers, and one police officer is dealing with\nthe driver, saying, you know, where's your insurance\npapers and so on, and at the same time the other officer\nis questioning the -- the passenger -- are you saying\nthat that independent questioning of the passenger in\neffect eliminates the -- the passenger's seizure as --\nas following from the seizure of the driver?\nMR. PINCUS: I think it's -- I think it's\npart, as the lower court found here, it's part -- it's a\nrelevant circumstance. This is a totality of the\ncircumstance test. The court of appeals here looked at\nthat as one fact, looked at the officer's subjective\nintention --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't get it. Why\nshould the fact that an officer, a separate officer is\ntalking to the passenger, ultimately have anything to do\nwith the duration of the passenger's seizure, absent a\nsituation in which officer two says, \"by the way, you're\ntotally free to go\"? We don't have that kind of strange\nsituation. But short of a strange situation like that,\nwhy does the conversation with the passenger have\nanything much to do, have any bearing on the -- on the\nlength of the passenger's seizure?\nMR. PINCUS: To the extent -- I think the\nquestion here is what's -- one question is what's\ncommunicated to the passenger.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. PINCUS: If the officer had said in\nturn, would you mind stepping out of the car so I can\nask you some questions unrelated to the stop about your\nhometown, it seems to us that that statement by the\nofficer would provide some pretty strong indication that\nthe seizure was over and that this was a separate\ninvestigation, having nothing to do with the seizure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we accept as hornbook\nlaw when they are -- when the police are questioning one\nindividual whom they stopped, let's say for a traffic\nviolation, that during that period of seizure, the\nreasonable period of seizure, the officer can ask\nquestions about other subjects, and that doesn't end the\nseizure.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the Court has said that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Like the -- passenger.\nMR. PINCUS: The Court has said that the\nofficer can ask those questions, but the Court hasn't\nsaid what the impact of that is on the seizure. And\nHere the officer certainly believed that her conduct and\nher words and her conversation, which we don't know how\nlong it lasted or if there were a number of questions,\ncommunicated to the -- to the individual, to Mr.\nJohnson, the idea that this was a consensual encounter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to -- I don't\nwant to take up your whole argument on this hobbyhorse\nof mine, but I mean my -- my only problem is, I don't\nsee that we have got an evidentiary basis here to say\nthat because of the duration or the mere fact of the\nquestioning, there is a reason to say that as to the\npassenger, a reasonable passenger could say I am no\nlonger seized, and -- and this encounter is totally\nconsensual.\nThe -- the officer testified, no question\nabout it, but the test is subjective.\nMR. PINCUS: It is subjective. And I guess\nI would also point, Your Honor, to the Court's decision\nin Drayton, which dealt with the question in a somewhat\ndifferent context, at a bus search, and whether or not\npassengers on a bus would feel that they were seized\nwhen there were officers in the front of the bus and\nthey were asking questions. And to us, although this is\nobviously the converse, a lot of the analysis in\nDrayton, which showed that -- which concluded that there\nwasn't a seizure there, because of the -- because people\nultimately would feel free to come and go, given the\nnature of the interaction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then don't you lose\nunder that line of cases? This is the picture that the\nofficer was painting, or I thought was, to bring this\nwithin the \"Mind if I search your luggage\" category of\ncases.\nMR. PINCUS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- she's got consent.\nShe doesn't have to -- she says, he said okay, he would\nget out and talk to me; he said okay when I began to pat\nhim down; it's only in the middle of it he began to\nwriggle a little bit.\nMR. PINCUS: I think it's quite clear,\nJustice Ginsburg, that there's no question here that --\nthat there was a consent to the pat down. I think the\nlower courts have concluded and the other side hasn't\nsought review that there was no consent to the pat down\nhere.\nI think the reason that Drayton is -- is\nrelevant is that that's a case where the question for\nthe Court was would these people feel free to terminate\nthe encounter; and the Court concluded yes, they would.\nAnd we think, given the different\nsituation of the passenger, it's true that -- that\nBrendlin found the passenger seized. To some extent\nthat was to give the passenger a shield, not to be used\nas the sword for further interrogation of the passenger.\nIt recognized the reality that at the outset surely the\npassenger is seized.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're giving up a\nshield here, I take it? If instead of a pat down, the\nofficer said, where were you last night at 10:00\no'clock, without Miranda warnings, you would say, well\nthat's just -- that's just fine?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, you know, Berkemer says,\nin the context even of a traffic seizure, Miranda\nwarnings aren't necessarily necessary. But what we are\nsaying is that, given the different basis for the\nseizure here, it's that initial conclusion that at the\noutset, yes, but that person, unlike the -- unlike the\ndriver, who is the target of the police activity and\ntherefore a reasonable conclusion for the driver is he's\nseized until the end of that activity, the passenger is\nnot the target of the traffic stop.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the facts that\nshow that a reasonable person in the passenger's\nposition would have believed himself free to terminate\nthe encounter?\nMR. PINCUS: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the facts that\nshow that the person who was searched, which is Mr.\nJohnson -- is that right?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what are the facts\nthat suggest that he thought he was free to terminate\nthat encounter with the police?\nMR. PINCUS: That the -- that the\ninteraction with the officer had nothing to do with the\nsubject of the stop.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I would say\nwe've held a lot that that's just beside the point. If\nyou stop a car for a traffic stop, you can search it for\nall kinds of things. You can do all kinds of things not\nrelated. So if that's what they're relying on, I\nsuspect that that's not right, that it had to do with a\ndifferent subject matter.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Say I was lawfully stopped.\nAll right. Go ahead. I want to get all of them in\nfront of me.\nMR. PINCUS: That the officer herself\nbelieved that she had communicated the fact that the\ninteraction was voluntary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question is, how did\nshe do that?\nMR. PINCUS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: She said, \"You can leave\nwhatever time you want\"?\nMR. PINCUS: She did not do it that way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No.\nMR. PINCUS: Although the courts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're standing there\nand the policeman is in front of you, and they have\nstopped the car, and the woman who is the policeman\nsays, \"I want to search you.\" Do you think you're free\nto leave?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then. So now we have\ngot two of them. What's the third?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the third is that it was\nin -- it was not a road stop in an abandoned area, where\na --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it was on the highway.\nMR. PINCUS: No, it was in an urban area,\nactually.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was in an urban area.\nOkay. You're stopped in an urban area. The policeman\nsays you are stopped, and you are stopped lawfully.\nWill you get out of the car? Yes. The policeman begins\nto search for the -- the gun. Fine. You think you're\nfree to leave?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, obviously it wasn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the fourth? What's\nthe fourth? I just want to get them all out here. Is\nthere anything else?\nMR. PINCUS: I think we've gotten them all\nout onto the table.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, what they say is\na reasonable person would have found -- felt that he\ncould just say good-bye, and he would have felt this\neven though the car was stopped lawfully, she asked him\nto get out of the car, and she began to search him for a\ngun.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I say, can we not reverse\nthat?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, a couple of\nthings. I don't think the question is at the moment --\nclearly, at the moment she was conducting the pat-down\nsearch, he was seized. But if that were the test, then\neven in the -- in the Terry situation, the person is\nobviously in fact seized at the time that the pat-down\nsearch is conducted, but that's not -- the question is\nwhether there was, in the moments before, there was a\nbasis to immobilize that person.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm saying if the\nquestion is whether the person reasonably thought at the\ntime of the search he could leave, there's certainly a\nstrong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did\nnot reasonably think he could leave. As long as that is\nso, the issue in front of us is when you stop a person,\na policeman in the course of your duties, and that\nperson thinks that he cannot reasonably leave, and you\nbelieve reasonably that he's armed, can you pat him\ndown? Well, asked that way, certainly a strong\nargument, the answer is yes, if you don't want to be\nkilled.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I guess a couple of\nanswers to that, Justice Breyer. First of all, if this\nis just a case about whether the lower court made a\ncorrect determination about whether there was a seizure\nor not, there's not -- maybe there's not much to the\ncase. We think the lower court did make the right\ndetermination for the reasons that I gave. And I should\nsay, it seems -- it does seem to me, and I was trying to\nget at this point in response to Justice Souter's\nquestion, there are two related questions here. One is\nwhat a reasonable person in Mr. Johnson's position would\nbelieve? One is what is the authority of an officer in\nterms of the duration for which a passenger may be\nseized?\nOne answer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you look at\nthe first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's\nposition would believe, how does he tell? I mean, even\nif the other officer goes to the window and starts\nasking the driver, \"Can I see your insurance papers,\"\nthere's no representation that's why we stopped you,\nthat's all we're interested in. They may have stopped\nhim because they have reason to believe that that car\nwas involved in criminal activity. They don't have to\ndisclose immediately what's involved.\nSo how can the passenger know why the\nofficer is stopping the person in the first place?\nHypothesize that he has been involved in criminal\nactivity. He may think, well, they've caught me and\nthey're just going through this charade to try to get\ninformation about it and make the people feel\ncomfortable, whatever. I mean, just because he says,\n\"You don't have insurance papers,\" that's -- I don't\nthink it's reasonable for the passenger to say, \"Oh,\nthis is not about me. I can get up and leave.\"\nMR. PINCUS: Well, that may not be -- by\nitself, it may not be enough. We think, together with\nthe other factors here, the fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what else?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the fact that the officer\nbelieved, therefore her tone, we have to assume, the way\nshe -- that she spoke and the way her subjective intent\nindicated, that she believed what was going on here was\na conversation in an effort to get gang information --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He is supposed to\nassume that it's not about him because of her tone?\nMR. PINCUS: No, he was supposed to assume\nthat it was consensual because of her tone, because that\nwas her intent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we go beyond. I\nmean, once we go beyond, I become a little at sea as to\nwhat the answers are because policemen do things other\nthan investigate crime.\nA policeman is on protective duty. The\nindividual he is protecting is approached by a member of\nthe Crips gang, who has a bulge in his pocket. Can the\npolice, with reasonable grounds to think that that\nperson is armed, pat down that person? Or is he\nsupposed to wait until the gun comes out of the pocket\nand the person who is being protected is shot?\nA policeman is on a bridge. Somebody stops\nthe car in the middle of the bridge. Traffic is held up\nin all directions. The policeman goes to try to remove\nthe car from the bridge. In the back seat is a member\nof the Crips gang with a bulge in his pocket. Is the\npoliceman supposed to ignore that?\nI mean, policemen do many things, and once\nyou tell me that we're going beyond the facts of this\ncase, I can think of all kinds of hypotheticals that\naren't so hypothetical, and I become uncertain about\nwhen the policeman can and when he cannot.\nSo, how do you respond?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think that\n-- first of all, a couple of reactions: First of all, I\nthink that it is important, and I alluded to this\nearlier, the sliver of cases we're dealing with here are\ncases in which there is reasonable -- allegedly a\nreasonable suspicion that someone is armed and\ndangerous, but not reasonable suspicion that criminal\nactivity is afoot. Those two standards are mutually\nreinforcing. In most cases where there is serious\nevidence that someone is armed and dangerous, you're\ngoing to have a very -- almost certainly you will have a\nreasonable suspicion that crime is afoot because the\ndangerousness part requires -- means you'll have\nsuspicion of assault or some other kind of activity. So\nI --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, I want to go\nback to the previous subject for a minute. We certainly\ndidn't take this case to decide whether the passenger\nwas free to leave or not. That -- that was not the\nissue on which we took the case. And you claim that\nthat issue has already been resolved by findings of the\nlower courts?\nMR. PINCUS: That the court of appeals here\ndetermined -- its decision rested on the fact that this\nwas a consensual encounter.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In order to contradict\nthat, would we have to find that that's clearly\nerroneous?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think it's a mixed\nquestion of fact and law, Your Honor. So I think, with\nrespect to the underlying facts, you probably have to\nfind that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any dispute on the\nunderlying facts?\nMR. PINCUS: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. PINCUS: -- I don't think the underlying\nfacts are disputed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there is a dispute\nas to whether the man thought he was free to leave.\nThat's a big dispute, isn't it?\nMR. PINCUS: That is -- that is the disputed\nquestion: Whether -- or whether a reasonable person in\nhis position --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did he testify?\nMR. PINCUS: No, not at the petition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So nobody asked him\nwhether he thought he was free to leave -- which would\nhave solved a lot of problems.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your hypothesis\nabout why she -- why he was free to leave is because of\nthe tone of the arresting officer? The tone of the --\nMR. PINCUS: It's the totality of the\ncircumstances: The tone of the officer, the fact it was\nin an urban area where there were some place --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there's no\nfinding about the tone of the officer, right?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the officer herself\ntestified about what her intent was. And I think most\npeople, when they -- that's their intent, it's carried\nthrough in how they interact with someone.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you keep emphasizing\nthat this is an urban area, and it seems to me that's\ngoing to lead to a test that's impossible to administer.\nI can think of a lot of circumstances in which the\npassenger in a car that is stopped will not think for\npractical reasons that there is much alternative but to\nwait until the driver is permitted to get back in the\ncar and drive away.\nAll of those would fall under your urban\ncategory, wouldn't they? If it's night -- suppose this\nwas a dangerous area. Suppose this was in an area that\nwas the turf of a rival gang, so it really wouldn't be\nvery practical for this person to start walking down the\nstreet. There are not just urban areas and rural areas;\nthere are expressways in urban areas; there are suburban\nareas.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All of those things would --\nyou would have to draw a line taking all of those things\ninto account.\nMR. PINCUS: It -- it would be a factual\nquestion in every case as it is in the typical Fourth\nAmendment arrest case about whether someone is seized.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we didn't think it\nwas a factual question in -- in Brendlin. In Brendlin\nwe said even when the wrongdoing -- this is at page 7 --\neven if the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the\npassenger will expect to be the subject of some\nscrutiny. And his attempt to leave the scene would be\nso obviously likely to prompt an objection from the\nofficer that no passenger would feel free to leave in\nthe first place. And that's why we held there was a\nseizure. You're basically arguing with the premise of\nBrendlin.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I'm\nabsolutely not. I think Brendlin clearly holds that\nthere is a seizure at the outset. The question that\nBrendlin does not explicitly address, and it's one the\nCourt explicitly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Brendlin says no passenger\nwould like -- would feel free to leave during the course\nof the investigation. And -- and I would have to agree\nwith that as a -- as a common-sense matter.\nIt would be amazing to me that this fellow\nsaid: I'm not going to talk to you anymore; I'm\nleaving; and -- and the -- and the police officer would\nallow it, particularly when the police officer, we know,\nsearched the person.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I don't -- I mean I think\nit -- it may depend upon the other facts in that -- in\nthat situation, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the facts? That\nis, this happened quite close to the beginning of the --\nof the stop, didn't it?\nMR. PINCUS: We don't know.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We don't know. I -- I read\nthis. But it said -- I mean I thought, from judging it,\nthat it did happen within a few minutes of the -- of the\nbeginning. They were still talking to the driver. We\nknow that.\nMR. PINCUS: We -- we actually don't, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We don't?\nMR. PINCUS: We don't. We know that the --\nthat the conversation seemed to be -- the interaction\nseemed to have started shortly after the interaction\nwith the driver.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PINCUS: We don't know how they -- how\nlong they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there any reason\nto think it was half an hour?\nMR. PINCUS: We just don't know. The -- the\nrecord doesn't say. We don't know.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree that if you\n-- if you lose on the seizure issue, you lose?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, we think if\n-- if there was a seizure, then -- then we think there\nis a -- a second question, which is even if the person\nwas seized, it's not clear to us that the Court's\nprecedents say that -- that that automatically permits a\npat down on armed and dangerousness.\nMy friends rely on Mimms. The Court in\nMimms made very clear -- and, in fact, as we recite on\npages 31 to 32 of our brief -- footnote 5 in Mimms says\nthat the reason for the pat down there was that once the\ndriver alighted, the officer had independent reason to\nsuspect criminal activity and present danger. And it\nwas on that basis that the pat-down search was\npermissible.\nSo the Court hasn't said that in the context\nof a roadside stop, once you are seized in this, at\nleast for a passenger, somewhat different sense than a\nTerry seizure based on articulable suspicion about that\nperson's criminal activity, that is enough. We think\nthe relevant standard there is supplied by the Court's\ndecisions in -- in Summers and associated cases, which\nsay the officer can control the scene, and that might\nallow a pat-down search if that's what the officer is\ntrying to do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess what about -- I --\nI guess if we held that you could do this, this pat-down\nsearch here, it would probably carry forward to any\nother kind of seizure like a -- a roadblock to inspect\nfor drunken driving or anything like that?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, that's -- that's part of\nthe concern, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We would say the same\nthing: That if there is a passenger in that car, you\ncould tell the passenger to get out and conduct a\npat-down search.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, even though -- even\nthough, again, there is no particularized suspicion\nabout that passenger. So this is a pretty dramatic\nexpansion of the officer's ability to -- to search, and\nwe think it should be cabined very closely to those\nsituations in which there really is a threat of armed\nand dangerous.\nAnd as I was saying before, \"armed and\ndangerousness\", \"a reasonable suspicion that a crime is\nafoot,\" are mutually reinforcing. If one isn't present,\nif the State, as here, is arguing that one isn't\npresent, it tends to cast doubt on whether the other is\npresent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't the -- why\nisn't the \"seizure\" and the \"consensual\" aspect also\nmutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each\nother? It seems to me it's an awfully difficult\ndecision for the officer to make. I stopped this\nperson. I know under Brendlin that he is seized, and\nI'm engaged in a dialogue, and I have to worry that at\nsome point he thinks he is free to leave.\nMR. PINCUS: I'm -- I'm not sure that I\nunderstand what you are -- what you are getting at in\nyour -- in your question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you seem --\nyour argument assumes a fairly bright line between the\npoint at which the individual is seized and the point at\nwhich the interaction becomes a consensual search. And\nI'm just saying that in the running line of cases, that\nline is going to be very blurry.\nMR. PINCUS: As it is blurry when the -- in\nthe converse situation when the question is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. The converse\nsituation is that so long as the interaction continues,\nit is a seizure, and the officer can take reasonable\nsteps, the pat down to protect, her safety. That\ndoesn't have a line-drawing issue.\nMR. PINCUS: No, I'm talking about the\nDrayton situation, Your Honor. When the -- when the\nquestion is: Has a consensual interaction morphed into\na seizure, then there is also a -- a -- it's an\nuncertain line. But the Court has said that there it's\na totality-of-the-circumstances test and, obviously --\nsort of -- the shoes are all on the other feet there,\nbecause the -- law enforcement doesn't want that to\nhappen. And so it's arguing that the facts don't amount\nto a seizure, and here we're sort of in the converse\nsituation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you don't concede\nin this case, or do you, that Trevizo had a reasonable\nsuspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous? That\nhas not been found for purposes of --\nMR. PINCUS: Absolutely not. The lower\ncourt assumed it for the purposes of decision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So even if you did not\nprevail, we would have to remand on that point?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, that point would have to\nbe remanded so that the court below could address it.\nJust to -- just to return to the final\npoint, the -- the sliver of cases we're talking about\nhere, \"armed and dangerousness, but not crime afoot,\"\nit's a very small sliver. The government hasn't shown\nthat that's a real problem that has to be taken care of.\nIn fact, in this case if the officers really\nhad believed that -- that there was proof of \"armed and\ndangerousness,\" why wouldn't they have argued that they\nhad proof that crime was afoot, given that they knew\nthat Mr. Johnson was a felon? We think that the reason\nthat the State took that off the table was it doesn't\nhave a lot of confidence in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it lawful to possess a\nfirearm?\nMR. PINCUS: If you're a convicted felon,\nno?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was he convicted?\nMR. PINCUS: He had admitted to the officer\nthat he had engaged in burglary. In fact, that's one of\nthe reasons to show that he's not dangerous is that he\nwas very forthcoming about the fact that he had a\nconviction. So the fact that the State took that off\nthe table and didn't rely on it, we think, shows, (a),\nthat they don't have a lot of confidence that there's\nreal \"armed and dangerousness\" here. And so that the\n\"danger\" in a systemic sense, as Justice Souter pointed\nout, relying only on that prong as the basis for\ncabining off, is discretionary. As justice Kennedy said\nin a separate decision in Whren, it's very easy to -- to\nconduct an unlawful search.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have difficulty\naccepting your suggestion that there is a sliver of\ncases. It seems to me there are a multitude of cases in\nwhich officers might suspect somebody is armed but not\nthink criminal activity is afoot, but decide they would\nlike to pat them down.\nMR. PINCUS: I think it is the\n\"dangerousness\" element, Your Honor. If they are \"armed\nand dangerousness,\" which is the test that the Court set\nout in Terry and it is the test that my colleagues are\nasking for, \"dangerous,\" to me, connotes a threat to\nsomeone. And it's a very small step, I think, between\nbeing a threat to someone and having a reasonable\nsuspicion that an assault may be committed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you argue in -- in all\nof this that this guy was not dangerous?\nMR. PINCUS: We -- we agree. We argue very\nstrenuously that he wasn't dangerous, but -- but I -- I\nthink the key point here is -- is that it -- it may well\nbe a sliver of cases, but removing the sort of mutually\nreinforcing nature of these two tests threatens to\nreally downgrade the standard in a way that officer\ndiscretion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could he not be\ndangerous? First, she said: I suspected him because he\nwas looking behind, but -- and then she said he was\nwearing the clothes of a gang, and then he admits to\nhaving been convicted of a burglary. Why isn't it very\nnormal for a person to be apprehensive?\nMR. PINCUS: All right. Let me give three\nquick answers to those. First of all, he looked -- this\nwas an unmarked car, Your Honor. I -- I think a -- a\nvery reasonable inference is he looked behind because he\nwas surprised that there were, all of a sudden, flashing\nlights and a siren on a car.\nThe gang colors, as the lower court -- the\nCourt of Appeals here noted, although Mr. Johnson was\nwearing blue, the driver was wearing red. If these were\nreally gang colors, it -- it -- it is not consistent\nwith the conclusion that they were gang colors to have\npeople of different colors who were rival gangs in the\nsame car.\nAnd the third thing is, as lower courts have\nfound, acknowledging prior criminal convictions is a\nbasis for concluding that someone is not dangerous\nbecause they were forthcoming.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not so fast.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The \"armed and dangerous\"\nrequirement, does the \"dangerous\" requirement mean\nendangering the policeman, or is it enough -- is it\nenough if -- if you think this fellow is -- you know,\nhe's just a dangerous character. Is that enough, or\ndoes it have to be an immediate threat to the policeman?\nMR. PINCUS: I don't think this Court has\ncome down one way or -- or the other, Your Honor. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you think?\nMR. PINCUS: It seems to me there -- there\nis a requirement of immediate danger.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's not enough if\nyou think he's -- he's Al Capone?\nMR. PINCUS: I don't think if he's just a\nfishy character, it's enough. I think the reason is\nimmediate threat to society.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Parkhurst, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PARKHURST: This -- this case falls\ndirectly under Mimms and Wilson. Mimms and Wilson both\nhold that the officer has the authority to control the\noccupants of an automobile with or without suspicion of\nany wrongdoing by the occupant.\nIn this case, also, the traffic stop\nsatisfies the first prong of Terry, as we know from\nMimms. Also, there's no reason to suggest that this was\nany more than the normal length of a traffic stop here.\nIn fact, the evidence was that the -- one officer was\nstill talking with the driver while Officer Trevizo was\nconversing with Mr. Johnson.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you -- what do you\nsay about the other -- the other side's point that in\nthe case of a Terry stop there's a -- a mutually\nenforcing -- reinforcing aspect?\nYou have a suspicion that -- there is crime\nafoot to begin with, plus the -- the suspicion that the\nperson is armed and dangerous; whereas, here, you know,\nit's a traffic stop is all.\nMR. PARKHURST: The -- yes, that's true.\nHowever, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what -- what is required\nwhere you think criminal activity is afoot is not\nnecessarily going to be the same as what's required when\nyou -- when there's just a traffic stop.\nMR. PARKHURST: She -- Officer Trevizo\ntestified repeatedly at the hearing that she did not\nbelieve he was actually about to commit a crime. She\ncould not put her -- put her finger on exactly what it\nwas that he was doing at the moment.\nHowever, we believe that in the context of a\ntraffic stop we -- the State has satisfied the first\nTerry prong here because traffic stops frequently don't\ninvolve any kind of criminal activity, just as -- as in\nthis case, a civil violation. However, that was enough\nto put the officer and the individual in close\nproximity, and if she noticed enough indicia of -- that\nhe was dangerous, she certainly was authorized to\nconduct a pat-down search.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
