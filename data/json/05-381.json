        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst in case 05-381 Weyerhaeuser Company versus\nRoss-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company.\nMr. Pincus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether the\nstandards this Court adopted in Brooke Group to\ndetermine whether a seller's prices violate the\nantitrust laws because they are too low also should\napply in assessing the claim that the buyer's purchase\nprices are illegally high. We submit that the Brooke\nGroup test applies because the four key underpinnings of\nthe Court's ruling apply fully here.\nFirst, there's a high risk of mistaking\naggressive competition for anticompetitive behavior.\nIncreasing the prices that are paid for inputs like\nlowering sales prices is a mechanism by which a firm\ncompetes. It's the result that we would expect from a\nbuyer's ordinary competitive instincts. So the conduct\ntargeted here is on its face identical to core\nprocompetitive conduct. It's also very hard to\ndistinguish losses suffered by a more inefficient\ncompetitor from hard -- to anticompetitive behavior, but\nthe antitrust laws --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you a\npreliminary question before you get too far into your\nargument? Is it your understanding that the\ninstructions to the jury were that finding that\npredatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to\nestablish a Section 2 violation? I know the Court of\nAppeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think\nthe jury was so instructed?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. Our position is that that\nis what the jury was instructed, because the predatory\npricing instruction said one of plaintiff's contentions\nis that defendant purchased more logs than needed or\npaid a higher price for logs than necessary in order to\nprevent the plaintiffs from obtaining the logs they\nneeded at a fair price. I'm reading from page 14(a) of\nthe appendix to the petition. And then it concluded, if\nyou find this to be true, you may regard it as an\nanticompetitive act.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may consider it as an\nanticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard\nit as a violation of Section 2.\nMR. PINCUS: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And as I read the\ninstructions, it did require there be three elements of\nthe violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not\ndiscussed by the Court of Appeals.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, there is no,\nthere is no contention here about monopoly power. The\nfocus here is on the conduct element of Section 2.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you concede there is\nmonopoly power?\nMR. PINCUS: We are not disputing it before\nthis Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is that relevant to\nthe question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an\nattempt to preserve that power or require that power,\nplus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of\nsection 2.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, our view is\nwhat the Court has said in cases like Trinko, is that\nthe test is monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct.\nThose are the two elements. We are not contesting the\nmonopoly power element. We are looking at whether there\nwas anticompetitive conduct here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree that the\nconduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a\nviolation, the question of whether the conduct plus the\nmonopoly power --\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. Because this is a claim\nunder Section 2, there would have to be either monopoly\npower or a danger of probability to the monopoly power.\nIt's single firm conduct so there would have to be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so you're arguing not\nonly that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient\nto prove a violation, but it also was not even an\nanticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. We are\narguing both things. I think, I'm not sure that there\nis much space between the two, but to the extent there\nis, we are arguing both.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Obviously, if there's just\nan anticompetitive act without a violation of the\nstatute, then there would be no basis for damages.\nMR. PINCUS: I think that's right, but I\nguess the way I think the Court has approached\ndetermining anticompetitive act, anticompetitive\nconduct, is it's the kind of conduct when engaged in by\na monopolist or an entity that has a dangerous\nprobability of cheating it, it is a violation of this\nstatute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course in the Brooke\ncase, it may not have even been a monopolist.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, because Brooke involved a\nclaim under the Patent Act. But this Court in the\nTrinko case has certainly interpreted the Brooke\nStandard as also applying to claims under Section 2.\nAnd in fact the Court explicitly said that in Brooke\nGroup.\nAs I said, the first critical underpinning\nis the risk of mistaking aggressive competition for\nanticompetitive behavior. Second, this case involves --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a little\ndifferent here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of\ncourse, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing\ntoo low, which has at least a direct benefit to\nconsumers either in the short term, certainly in the\nshort term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while\nhere that is not the form in which the anticompetitive\nconduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct\ntakes. So isn't that a reason not to think that we\nshould apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?\nMR. PINCUS: Your Honor, we don't, we don't\nthink that that difference is a distinction that\nwarrants a different test, for several reasons. First\nof all, we are dealing here with single firm pricing\nconduct and it's recognized that that's key to the\nproper functioning of the markets. As the court said in\nProfessional Engineers, fixed pricing is the central\nnervous system of the economy. It allocates goods and\nensures that, that they are allocated to the most\nefficient use.\nHere, although there's no immediate benefit\nto consumers, there is an immediate benefit to the\nsellers of the logs, who certainly benefit when\ncompetition drives up the prices that they achieve. And\nwe think that the Sherman Act protects them and gives\nthem the benefit of full competition just as much as it\ndoes consumers. Over the course --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever\nidentified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try\nto achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. In Mandeville Farms,\nwhich was a Section 1 case, the Court did talk about the\nfact that the antitrust laws protect sellers as well as\nbuyers, and that was a case in which there was allegedly\na Section 1 conspiracy to price too low, and the Court\nsaid that's per se unlawful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in Brooke Group,\nwe said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers,\nand in this other case we said it's a benefit when\nprices are high to suppliers.\nMR. PINCUS: Because the benefit that I\nthink the Court is looking at in both cases is not the\nparticular price levels, but in achieving and ensuring\nfree price competition because of the central role that\nprice plays in the economy. That's what the Court is\ntrying to protect in Professional Real Estate -- in\nProfessional Engineers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume it's a benefit to\nconsumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased\nbecause of higher prices being paid for those needed\ngoods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of\nthose goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit\nconsumers who want those goods.\nMR. PINCUS: That is our second argument,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you don't have that\nin this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought\none of the arguments on the other side was the\ninelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what\nthey were paying, basically the same amount of wood was\nultimately going to get processed; is that correct?\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. The claim is\nthat the supply was relatively inelastic, not that it's\nperfectly inelastic, and as long as the supply market is\nnot perfectly inelastic, an increase in price may lead\nto more supplies, maybe not as much as if there were\nhigher elasticity, but more. But there's another\nbenefit to consumers here, which is that if one would\nexpect that a buyer bidding more can make a more\nefficient use of the product and therefore generate more\noutput, and that output expansion which doesn't depend\non supply expansion is also beneficial to consumers\nbecause that means there will be more output in the\ndownstream market and a corresponding decrease in price.\nSo we have those two benefits to consumers\nand we also have the fact that as the Court said in\nProfessional Engineers, the Sherman Act reflects a\njudgment that price competition generally, a free and\nopen price competition will produce lower prices and\nbetter goods and services, and the Court has not\nrequired that that be traced to consumer welfare in\nevery particular case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I presume it could lead to\nlower consumer prices too. If you have a firm that has\ndeveloped a new, a new technique for processing the\nlogs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and\nsell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and\nthereby make even more profit, that firm would be\nwilling to pay more for those logs, even though it would\nsell them for less than competitors might sell them.\nMR. PINCUS: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia, and that's what the record reflects here, that\nWeyerhaeuser invested in its lumber mills and created a\nprocess that got more value out of a log. The record\nreflects that plaintiffs, for example, did not do that.\nAnd there is testimony that plaintiff's mill was quite,\nrelatively inefficient compared to Weyerhaeuser.\nWeyerhaeuser invested new processes that had less waste,\nproduced more output as Justice Scalia suggested, and\ntherefore it was able to sell, sell that output at a\nlower price and still make a profit, because it was\ngetting more output for log and therefore could pay more\nfor the log.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there any argument in\nthe trial court or in the briefs of the Court of Appeals\nas to how to calculate cost? You basically have two\nmarkets. You don't usually think of cost when you buy\nsomething. But was there any argument as to how to\ndetermine whether or not this was below cost in the\nBrooke Group sense?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, our view, Justice\nKennedy, there really wasn't, because the district judge\nhad made clear his view in the pretrial motions that\nthere wasn't a need to prove prices, and that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was the end of it\nat the trial court.\nMR. PINCUS: But our position is, and there\nhas certainly been some writing on this in the\nliterature, is that what one does is take the cost of\nproducing the output which includes the allegedly\npredatory price of the log, and here logs are 75 percent\nof the cost so it's a very big cost. Compare those\ncosts to the revenues that are received in the\ndownstream market and if those revenues exceed costs,\nthen you're in a position where the defendant is\nbehaving perfectly economically rationally. If they're\nless, then you go on to recoup it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, how do you\ndetermine the price of the logs? Because we, the\ncharges that some logs were purchased at an excessive\nprice, and if we were dealing with only those logs to\ndetermine cost, that's one thing. But we are, also in\nthis picture is that some of the logs came from\nWeyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term\ncontracts that it had, and those, the price was not\ninflated on those. So if you take those into account\nyou may get one figure, but if you take only the high\nbid logs you might get a different picture. So how,\nwhat is it? How do you determine costs? Do you look at\nall the logs that were purchased or only the ones that\nwere allegedly bid out?\nMR. PINCUS: No. You would look, you would\nlook, Your Honor, at all of the, at all of the logs,\njust as in the downstream market if you have a sell side\ncase, you look at, you look at prices of all sales.\nHere it's interesting that the record reflects that\nplaintiff received more than, between 30 and 50 percent\nof its logs from the same kind of long-term sources that\nit argues that Weyerhaeuser received it from. So in\nthis case there really isn't the kind of disparity, but\nour position would be that you add all of those up and\ncompare them to revenues.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me that\nwe have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure\nabout your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. If\nyou have your own logs that you own already and if you\nhave logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant\nlogs are the logs that both people are competing for.\nThat's the only relevant market that we are talking\nabout insofar as the purchaser is concerned.\nMR. PINCUS: And it might be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if Weyerhaeuser wanted\nto drive somebody out of the market, then they go after\nthe logs which are open to both parties.\nMR. PINCUS: And Your Honor, as the Court\nobserved in Brooke Group, there really wasn't a need\nthere to get into how the test works and we think there\nisn't here. We think the issue is symmetrical and it\nmight be that the focus is on the incremental costs that\nare associated with the alleged predatory volume, and\ntherefore that might focus on those incremental costs.\nBut in this case there's no dispute that, whatever the\nmeasure of costs, there has been no challenge to the\nposition that Weyerhaeuser's prices were above those\ncosts.\nLet me just turn back to, to the other two\nreasons why we think Brooke Group applies because I\nthink they're important. The third is it's much more\nlikely that the high bids here were going to, were a\nresult of legitimate competition than of anticompetitive\neffort. As this Court has observed both in Brooke Group\nand Matsushita, predatory conduct is self-deterring. To\nengage in it, the defendant has to be willing to incur a\nnear-term loss against the hope of higher returns later.\nAnd as the Court explained in those cases, the loss is\ndefinite but the gain depends on a number of\nimponderables. So there is some self-deterring.\nAnd finally, a test that provides no\nguidance threatens false positives that will deter the\nvery competition that our economy requires and that\nhelps our economy reach its most efficient state. As\nJustice Breyer put it for the First Circuit in Town of\nComfort, antitrust rules must be clear enough for\nlawyers to explain them to their clients, especially in\na sensitive area like pricing. And certainly the rule\nthat the Ninth Circuit adopted here has none of that\nclarity and we think that the Court's Brooke Group\ndecision and that test does.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nSupposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the\ncompany did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and\nthere were minutes of the board of directors says that\nin order to do this we've got to drive company X out of\nbusiness and so you, we want you to compete in every\ntransaction with company X that you can and buy the logs\nat a higher price. Would that be an anticompetitive act\neven if it did not result in loss to the defendant?\nMR. PINCUS: And the only anticompetitive\nconduct alleged was pricing conduct, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. The\nanticompetitive -- the plan is to drive the company out\nof business. And the only anticompetitive conduct other\nthan proving the whole objective is that you pick on\nthis one competitor and outbid him every time you can.\nCould that possibly give rise to a damage claim?\nMR. PINCUS: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the whole purpose\nwas to drive it out of business?\nMR. PINCUS: Even if that was the whole\npurpose.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pursuant to a plan to\nacquire a monopoly.\nMR. PINCUS: And the reason for that,\nJustice Stevens, is it's very hard to distinguish,\nespecially for the judicial system to distinguish,\nbetween hard-fought competition and anticompetitive\nintent if all we're looking at is what's in people's\nmind set. As judge Easterbrook wrote in his AA Poultry\ndecision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it so hard if you\ntake Justice Stevens' premise that there's an agreement\nand we take that as a given, as a given premise?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, because there won't be a\ngiven premise in every case, Your Honor, and the problem\nis the Court has to write rules that will, that will\ngovern conduct, primary conduct of business people in\nthe market, and a rule that says if you can prove intent\nthen you don't have to worry about prices and costs is a\nrule that opens the door to second-guess, judicial\nsecond-guessing of prices --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but only intent plus\nmonopoly power. You have to be able to prove monopoly\npower, too.\nMR. PINCUS: You do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There aren't too many\ncases that fit this.\nMR. PINCUS: As the Court has recognized in\nthe section 2 context, the problem of deterring\nprocompetitive conduct is even more serious because you\ndon't have the threshold environment of proof of\nconspiracy, as one does in section 1. We're dealing\nwith unilateral conduct, and so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but unilateral conduct\nwhere you have monopoly power. There aren't too many of\nthese cases, as you know.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, market\ndefinition is a complicated issue and it may be hard for\nbusinesses --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was an issue that was\nresolved by the jury in this case and I don't understand\nyou to be disputing the resolution of that issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do we do in the\ncorrelative situation where there is an allegation of\npredatory selling rather than predatory buying if you\nhad the same situation posed by Justice Stevens? Namely\nevidence that you're trying to drive the competitor out\nof business, wouldn't that establish a violation?\nMR. PINCUS: It would not establish a\nviolation, Your Honor. In fact, the Brooke Group Court\ndealt with that very case because the dissent in Brooke\nGroup pointed out that the district court in that case\nhad held that the intent evidence was amongst the most\npowerful that had ever been, been presented in any case,\nand it still said, even though there was a clear\nevidence of intent --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that did not involve a\nmonopoly. That did not involve monopoly power.\nMR. PINCUS: But it involved the test for\npredatory pricing, Your Honor, under Robinson-Patman.\nBut the Court said its test was perfectly applicable to\nsection 2. And the lower courts have certainly applied\nthat test in just that way in section 2 cases. And if\nthe rule would be that even in the predatory selling\nsituation intent can override the price-cost and the\nrecoupment requirements, then you're in a situation\nwhere there's no ability for business people to know in\nadvance when low prices are justified. All we think is\nthat there should be symmetry.\nIf the Court has no further questions I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Pincus.\nMr. Shanmugam.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court.\nAggressive bidding by the buyer of an input,\nno less than aggressive pricecutting by the seller of a\nfinished product, is usually procompetitive. Because a\nclaim of predatory bidding is simply the flip side of a\nclaim of predatory pricing, the Brooke Group standard\nfor predatory pricing claims should apply to predatory\nbidding claims as well. And in our view the court of\nappeals erred in this case by sanctioning a broader and\nmore subjective standard of liability. In Brooke Group,\nthis Court adopted its now familiar two-pronged standard\nfor predatory pricing claims despite recognizing that\neach prong of that standard might permit some\nanticompetitive pricecutting. The court was willing to\ntolerate that modest degree of underinclusion because,\nin the Court's own words, \"The mechanism by which a firm\nengages in predatory pricing is the same mechanism by\nwhich a firm stimulates competition, namely by lowering\nits prices. And the Court explained that a broader or a\nless precise standard of liability would run the risk of\nprohibiting or chilling some procompetitive price\ncutting. In our view the same analysis can apply to a\nclaim of predatory bidding. Because aggressive bidding\nis usually procompetitive, application of the Brooke\nGroup standard is warranted in order to avoid\nprohibiting or chilling procompetitive conduct with\nregard to price in that context as well.\nThe court of appeals in this case held that\nBrooke Group was inapplicable to respondent's claim of\npredatory bidding by --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe\nthe hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your\nbrother, would you describe that as just aggressive\nbidding? Aggressive is, you know, it's kind of a good\nterm when you're talking about competition. But what if\nit's purposely bidding higher than you know your rival\ncan afford?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nunderstood Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and he can\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, to posit a case in which there\nwas dynamite evidence that the defendant had a\nmonopolistic or exclusionary intent. But in our view\nthat is insufficient to state a section 2 claim. One\nhas to have exclusionary conduct as well.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, you have to have the\nmonopoly power as well.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is also true, and\nwith regard to a claim of attempted --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In your view, if as the\njury was instructed in this case there was proof of\nmonopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that\npower, plus anticompetitive acts, does the\nanticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a\nviolation of the Sherman Act?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think you need to\nhave all three of those elements in order to state a\nclaim of attempted monopolization --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if you do have all\nthree, is that enough to prove a violation?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That would be enough to\nstate a claim for attempted monopolization under this\nCourt's decision in Separate Forks.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that how the\njury was instructed in this case?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: In our view the jury was\ninstructed that it would be sufficient to establish an\nanticompetitive act to find that petitioner priced its\nlogs --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but if it was not\ninstructed it would be sufficient to find a violation of\nsection 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not\ncorrect?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct, Justice\nStevens, and the jury was also instructed and in our\nview the jury was properly instructed with regard to the\nother two elements, namely a dangerous probability of\nmonopolization and a specific intent to monopolize. The\nsole question before this Court is what constitutes\nexclusionary conduct for purposes of section 2, what\nconstitutes it regardless of whether it's a claim of\nattempted monopolization or actual monopolization.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Go back to my\nhypothetical. Supposing you have the first two elements\nand you say in order to drive this company out of\nbusiness we want you to compete with them and get the\nlogs at whatever cost it takes. Would that be an\nanticompetitive act?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: No, Justice Stevens. That\nwould solely be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was for the\nsole purpose of driving the company out of business in\norder to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That would be evidence, and\nit may be powerful evidence, of a monopolistic intent,\nthough courts have noted that even with regard to that\nrequirement it's famously difficult to distinguish\nbetween a legitimate competitive attempt on the one hand\nand an illegitimate monopolistic intent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, no. I'm assuming this\nis not evidence of intent. There's independent evidence\nof both intent and monopoly power. With those two\nelements established, would this, the kind of evidence I\ndescribed, be evidence of an injury to the plaintiff\nthat could be actual in damages?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: No, Justice Stevens. You\nwould need to have objective evidence that the defendant\nmet both of the prongs of the Brooke Group requirement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Will you need to meet the\nprongs of the Brooker test even if you otherwise prove a\nviolation of section 2?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I'm not quite sure\nwhat it means to say that you otherwise prove a\nviolation in that example.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You prove monopoly power\nplus an intent to maintain or acquire it.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That is insufficient. You\nhave to have some action --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's insufficient to\nprove a violation of Section 2?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It is insufficient to prove\na violation of section 2 because you have to have some\nconduct that is classed as exclusionary, and in our view\nthat is the content that the Brooke Group standard\nsupplies. It specifies the conduct that you need to\nhave and that conduct is the defendant suffering a loss\nin the short term and having a dangerous probability of\nrecouping that loss in the long term.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you could have a\ncompany that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to\nmonopolize and the means that they choose is just\nidiotic. For example, they say, we're going to try to\nget a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as,\nat as low a price as possible. You would have the two\nelements, monopoly power, intent to monopolize, but you\nwouldn't have an act that constitutes anticompetitive\nconduct.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what you're\nasserting is the case here.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: You could have an\nincompetent monopolist more generally or an incompetent\npredator in this specific context. And I think that the\nonly other thing I would say with regard to this\ncolloquy is that the Court really did confront this\nissue in Brooke Group. There was fairly strong evidence\nof monopolistic intent and the majority opinion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no evidence\nof monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in\nthat case.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's right, and it wasn't\nan issue simply because it was a Robinson-Patman Act\ncase and all that is required under the Robinson-Patman\nAct is the possibility of harm to competition and there\nwas some disagreement about whether a showing had been\nmade of that requisite possibility between the majority\nopinion and your dissenting opinion. But I don't think\nthat there was any disagreement in Brooke Group with\nregard to the relevant standard for exclusionary\nconduct. Even the dissenting opinion recognized that\nrecoupment would be necessary in order to state the\npredatory pricing claim in the Robinson-Patman Act\ncontext.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would your answer be the\nsame if you added to Justice Stevens' hypothetical very\nhigh barriers of entry that would prevent other\ncompetitors from entering the market after the target\nwas driven out?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: High barriers to entry,\nJustice Alito, would be very relevant to the inquiry\nunder the second prong of the Brooke Group standard,\nnamely whether the defendant had a dangerous probability\nof recoupment in the long term. And indeed in many\npredation cases, many predatory pricing cases in the 13\nyears since Brooke Group, barriers to entry have been\nabsolutely vital in resolving predatory pricing claims\nat the summary judgment stage, because typically\ndefendants will make the argument that the absence of\nbarriers to entry make the possibility of recoupment\nunlikely. But that is a consideration that is built\ninto the Brooke Group standard and it certainly would be\npart of the Brooke Group analysis in the predatory\nbidding context as well.\nI want to say just one thing in response to\nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy's questions to my\nfriend Mr. Pincus about the question of the appropriate\nmeasure of cost if Brooke Group were to apply to\npredatory bidding claims. As in Brooke Group itself, we\nbelieve that it is unnecessary for this Court to specify\nthe exact method of calculating costs in this case. But\nthe position of the United States more generally both in\nthe predatory pricing context and in the predatory\nbidding context is that a Court should look to a\ndefendant's incremental costs, and in this context that\nwould mean looking to the amount of the input that was\nthe subject of the alleged predation. So in this case\nthe amount of logs that petitioner allegedly predatorily\npurchased on the open market. And such an incremental\napproach to be sure is not within its difficulties in\napplication and for that reason a number of lower courts\nin the predatory pricing context have instead looked to\naverage variable costs or other measures as a proxy for\nincremental costs. But we believe that in a case such\nas this one, looking to incremental costs may be useful\nbecause it effectively excludes from the analysis any\npotential cross-subsidization, whether by virtue of the\nfact that in this case, for example, petitioner may have\nharvested logs from its own lands. There are claims in\nthis case that petitioner entered into various exclusive\ndealing arrangements as well, obtained logs at a lower\nprice on that basis. And an incremental approach has\nthe virtue of focusing only on that portion of the\nmarket that is the subject of the alleged predation\nclaims.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You also, I take it, have\nto have an equally limited approach on the recoupment\nanalysis, then. I mean, your recoupment analysis would\nhave to be symmetrical with your cost analysis.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. That's absolutely\ntrue, Justice Souter, and again this is an issue that\nthe lower courts have been grappling with in the\npredatory pricing context, and I by no means want to\nsuggest that it is always an easy analysis in the\npredatory pricing context. Professor Arita's treatise\nhas hundreds of pages on the appropriate calculation of\ncost, but I think that the important thing to remember\nwith regard to the below cost pricing prong of the\nBrooke Group analysis is that it does provide an\nobjective yardstick by which a defendant's loss can be\nmeasured.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Shanmugam.\nMr. Haglund.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. HAGLUND\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. HAGLUND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease The Court.\nIn this Court's antitrust jurisprudence over\nthe last 25 years, market realities have consistently\ntrumped per se rules. The same approach should apply\nhere. Brooke Group's per se rule which carved out a\nspecial exception to the standard rule of reason\nbalancing test in Section 2 cases should not be extended\nto the buy side. No safe harbor per se rule is\njustified here because raising input prices, unlike\ncutting output prices, is moving prices in the wrong\ndirection for consumers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But even it does hurt the\nsuppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't\nknow just as, but they are just as concerned about a\ngroup of small farmers or a group of small growers or a\ngroup of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as\nthey are with a group of consumers having to fight off a\nmonopoly seller.\nMR. HAGLUND: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean that's pretty well\nestablished, isn't it?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well I'd like to point out\nthat the Mandeville Farms case that Mr. Pincus cited\ndoes not stand for the same --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, Congress has\nactually passed special legislation that the Mandeville\nFarms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so\n-- you want me to write the proposition that the\nantitrust laws are not concerned --\nMR. HAGLUND: Oh, absolutely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- with the monopoly buyer\nwho would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers,\nfarmers?\nMR. HAGLUND: Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. HAGLUND: But in this particular context\nwhich the Ninth Circuit repeatedly emphasized, in an\ninelastic market like this one raising input prices is\nnot going to increase supply and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That can't possibly be\nright, can it? I mean if in fact the object here is to\nstrike, is -- suppose their object is what you say.\nTheir object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the\nbuying side over a group of small woodsmen. And they\nmight do that if they drove out all the buying\ncompetitors, and now what are they going to try to do?\nWhat they will try to do if they get that terrible\nmonopoly, which would be bad --\nMR. HAGLUND: Drive prices down.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Drive prices way\ndown, below what the woodsmen could get for them. And\nif that's going to have any effect aside from an income\neffect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread\nline or go to other places where they have other jobs at\nlesser revenue than they would get by staying in the\nwoods business and selling at a reasonable price. That\nwould be an antitrust concern.\nMR. HAGLUND: Absolutely, and that is\nexactly what Weyerhaeuser's plan was here, as shown by\ntheir own materials, that their plan was and in fact\nthey did foresee and project that log prices would go\ndown in 2001 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So where we are is at the\nproblem. The problem is the same as at the buying side.\nWhat we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad\neffects. On the other hand, low prices are good for the\nconsumer.\nMR. HAGLUND: But you're not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here we have bad effects,\nbad possibilities. On the other hand, higher prices are\ngood for the woodsmen. So we need rules to separate the\nsheep from the goats. And the other side is proposing a\nrule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad\nconduct, unless the person who pays the money for the\ngoods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when\nhe tries to sell them he will incur a loss.\nNow I would have thought for 40 years that\nwas a traditional idea. If you're trying to decide\nwhether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad\npurposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good\npurposes, then a very good key to that is do these\npeople expect in the long run to make money out of this\nwithout driving those victims out? If the answer is\nyes; they can make money on the market, they are storing\nup nuts for winter. It's good. And if the answer is no\nit's bad. That's called the recoupment test. I don't\nthink that's new. I think it's old. And I'm not sure\nwhat your view of it is.\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, as to Brooke Group and\nwhat the Court's being asked to do here, Justice Breyer,\nis to go down the same path that it did in Albrecht\nversus Harold Company in '68 when it agreed to treat\ncompletely symmetrically minimum and maximum vertical\nresale price restraints.\nLater on, in State Oil Company vs. Kahn the\nCourt abandoned and accepted Justice Harlan's dissent\nthat it was wrong to equate those two.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I agree with you. But I\ndon't still think you can defend this retail versus\nmaximum price restraint. That's a whole another kettle\nof fish. And what I'm interested -- I guess my\nquestion particularly is, I propose one test not two,\nbut it might be that my test encompasses the dollar test\nand incremental costs and so forth. What do you think\nof my one test?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One test is if they are not\ngoing to make money legitimately out of this in the long\nrun, it's bad, unless they can explain it away. But if\nthey are, it's okay.\nMR. HAGLUND: The problem with granting a\nsafe harbor for above cost input purchases is that it\ndoes not work well in this context, especially in an\ninelastic market. The suggestion that you can simply\nuse incremental cost is not a workable approach here if\nyou look at the facts in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the fact\nthat the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational\nactors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to\nrealize that they are in a better shape having two\nbuyers rather than just one. So maybe they forego the\nextra 50 cents a log, or whatever -- tree, it is in the\nshort term and sell enough to keep the other company in\nbusiness? I mean they can make that decision\nthemselves. Or they can make the decision as rational\nactors that they are better off having more money that\nthey can then use to buy more alder saplings that they\ncan plant for the future. And either way it benefits\nthe consumers.\nMR. HAGLUND: Well not, that's not quite\ncorrect, because the signals that the higher input\nprices show, yes, they do generally incent more\nproduction in a, in a typical market. Here, however,\nwhere you have a product that takes 30 to 50 years time\nand production, the price, higher price signals when\nthey are sent by a monopsonist, like Weyerhaeuser in\nthis case, actually send a very powerful message to tree\nfarmers not to replant alder, despite those high prices.\nAnd there was evidence in the follow-on cases that\nreference that.\nIt was alleged in our complaint in this case\nbut not actually backed up by any testimony at trial,\nthat tree farmers in Oregon and Washington were actually\nelecting not to replant alder and as Professor Noel\nnotes in his law review article in the issue of the\nAntitrust Law Journal, which by the way is the only area\n-- half of this issue is devoted to this subject. It's\nthe sum total of literature devoted to predatory\noverbidding in this area. And what Professor Noel notes\nis that where you have localized monopsony, the result\nis when the monopsony is in full flower a misallocation\nof resources between regions. The highly productive\nforest lands of the Pacific Northwest won't have as much\nalder in the future because of the significant signals\nsent by a monopsonist, even when they are engaged in\nthat scheme.\nThe seller is happy if he has mature alder\nto sell at that time to get the good price, but he is\nnot going to replant, because he sees that 30 years down\nthe road he will not have a competitive marketplace\nwithin which to sell his timber, and that was the\nreality in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if he is, if he\nis that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational\nand foresighted enough to know that he ought to be\nselling some to the other, the other processor even if\nthat processor is not bidding as much?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well we did actually have some\nrecord evidence in this case that at least a few people\nwere doing that. One of the major suppliers of the\nrespondent here, Ross-Simmons, was a company called\nLongview Fiber which made it -- a very sophisticated\npublicly held company -- made it a practice to sell most\nof its volume to Ross-Simmons on a market basis because\nit did not want the eventuality of not having\nRoss-Simmons in that competitive circle with\nWeyerhaeuser.\nMost small woodland owners, however, who may\nonly be in the market once every five years because\nthat's the nature of their rotation, of the age classes\nof the timber that they have got, are not in that kind\nof sophisticated position because they are in the market\nso infrequently to make that kind of a judgment. It's\nbeen --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we don't take the Brooke\nGroup approach, is the alternative to ask the jury to do\nwhat the instructions in this case ask them to do.\nMR. HAGLUND: No, it's not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: To decide whether\nWeyerhaeuser bought more logs than it needed in order to\nprevent its rivals from obtaining the logs that they\nneeded at a fair price? How is a jury to, a lay jury,\nto decide whether a company like Weyerhaeuser bought\nmore logs than it needed, or what is the fair price?\nMR. HAGLUND: We don't contend that the\ninstruction was perfect here, but if one looks at the\ninstruction as a whole and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you think it was\nsufficient.\nMR. HAGLUND: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE ALITO: You think it was sufficient\nenough.\nMR. HAGLUND: In this case it was legally\nsufficient and I point out that this Court very recently\nhas issued a decision in the first case of the term,\nAyers vs. Belmontes, where you looked at the question of\nthe catch-all mitigation factor in California in the\npenalty phase of a capital murder case. And you looked\nat the instruction and interpreted it in terms of the\nclosing arguments, the evidence and the other\ninstructions as a whole.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who proposed the\ninstruction in this case?\nMR. HAGLUND: The instruction, the paragraph\nthat is subject to the great criticism on the other\nside, was a paragraph that was drafted by the district\njudge and handed out near the end of the trial and then\ncommented on by the lawyers in, prior to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no requested\ncharge on this point by the plaintiff?\nMR. HAGLUND: That's -- as to the issue of\npredatory pricing, plaintiffs, as we make clear in our\nbrief, actually submitted a predatory pricing\ninstruction three weeks before the trial. You tend to\nbe overinclusive pretrial. Defendant on the other hand\nsurprisingly submitted no such instruction on predatory\npricing. The judge submitted a paragraph that had\nsomething more than what the current, or the ultimate\nparagraph contained. There was a debate over whether it\nneeded to be, whether it was consistent with Brooke\nGroup. I agreed with the other side that it did not\nhave both components of the Brooke Group test. Judge\nPanner and I had a colloquy where ultimately he was\ngoing to turn one paragraph into two, include a Brooke\nGroup test. We then withdrew our request for that\ninstruction, Weyerhaeuser objected to the, the thinned\ndown version of the ultimate paragraph.\nBut the interesting thing about\nWeyerhaeuser's relationship to this instruction is that\nthey really invited the linguistic framework of this,\n\"bought more than they needed\" or --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does that mean? What\ndoes a fair price in this, in this context mean? Does\nit mean the price that's necessary in order to keep an\ninefficient competitor in business?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, what it meant in this\ncase, Justice Alito, is that it meant what, how much did\nWeyerhaeuser artificially increase the log market above\nwhere it otherwise would have been? We had several\nexperts and a number of both industry and forest\neconomists testify that for 20-plus years log prices had\nbeen following lumber. There was an equilibrium in the\nmarket. Then you get to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that the standard of\nfairness? I mean that, you know, that may be fine. But\nhow does, how does a jury, A, what's the authority for\nsaying that is the standard of fairness and B, how does\na jury know that?\nMR. HAGLUND: The -- if you look at the\nNinth Circuit opinion, the Ninth Circuit made it clear\nthat the instructions as a whole provided sufficient\nguidance. Nowhere in the case as we tried it did we\nattempt to exploit the instruction in the way that\nWeyerhaeuser suggests happened.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe you didn't, but that\nbasically left the jury on a, on a free float, didn't\nit?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, I don't think so if you\nlook at the evidence. The evidence that we presented\nincluded a forest economist who presented three\ndifferent scenarios where he identified how much\nWeyerhaeuser had artificially increased log prices above\nwhere they would have been but for their anticompetitive\nbehavior. We in no way went to the jury in closing,\nsaying award what you think is fair. We relied\ncompletely on that evidence, and in fact the jury, which\nincluded a Ph.D. in physics in a high-tech industry, an\naccountant, the head of a chain store, and a banker and\na retired farmer, they looked at the evidence and they\nactually to the dollar picked one of those market -based\nscenarios for how much was the market elevated.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Let's assume I\naccept your sort of Delmonte's analysis here. If we\nwere to approve of that instruction in effect, as you\nwant us to do, and we also believe that on its face\nsomething more has got to be said than merely the word\nfair, what proposition would we say must be included in\nthat instruction to make the so-called fairness\ninstruction a sensible one that can be consistently\napplied?\nMR. HAGLUND: And we don't contend that it\nwas a perfect instruction. We think it would be\nperfectly appropriate if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that.\nMR. HAGLUND: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I'm saying if we follow\nyour lead, we're going to try to take that and make it a\ncloser to perfect instruction, and what should we say\nmust be added to it?\nMR. HAGLUND: It's quite simple. If you\nlook at that paragraph, there are two pieces of it. One\nof them, one portion says that you can regard it as an\nanticompetitive act if defendant purchased more logs\nthan it needed. We don't think that needs to be\nimproved because that's easy to figure out, and here we\nhad evidence that they continued --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Why is it easy to\nfigure out? As Justice Breyer brought up the\nstockpiling, how do you know whether they are storing\nit, or a time when the supply is short, or they are just\nletting it go to rack and moon in order to put this\ncompany out of business?\nMR. HAGLUND: Justice Ginsburg, you will\nknow because of the evidence in the case. If the\nplaintiff, the defendant is able to show that they were\nstoring up this extra input against a prospect of a\nprice hike in the future or because they were out trying\nto get enough volume for some promotion for a customer\nthat was going to significantly increase their\npurchases, then you'd have a different kind of case. We\nhave a situation where they warehoused large,\nunprecedentedly high volumes of lumber because they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why did they say they\nneeded it? I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy\nup there? Why don't you just prove what you just said?\nMR. HAGLUND: We did.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then why do you need\nall these other instructions about pricing? I suppose\nthe only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute\nas to whether it was in their economic interest in the\nabsence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy\nall these logs or not. And so it would be very\ninteresting if you have a way of proving that they did\nnot need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter\nwhich is likely to be disputed. So, I think the hard\nthing in these cases is to prove that. And if you can\ntell me how you prove that without giving the jury an\ninstruction something like, look to see whether they can\nsell them reasonably at a profit. Or, look to see even\nif they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could\nrecoup whatever they are losing later. Or, or, and you\nfill in some blanks, and now I'll have some candidates\nfor testing.\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, as to the paid a higher\nprice than necessary, the language we would suggest\ncould be used in another case and passed on by this\nCourt, is the following: Paid a higher price than\nnecessary to move the log market to higher levels than\notherwise would have prevailed in order to injure\ncompetition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. But of course, I want\nto injure competition always when I in fact sell at a\nlower price that I very much hope my competitor can't\npossibly meet, indeed would go out of business. I\ncheer. I would love to get a monopoly. I would love to\nmake a better product, lower prices, et cetera. Do you\nsee the problem? And so what you've told the jury there\non that instruction --\nMR. HAGLUND: But here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is that they can find\nthis person guilty even if all he wants to do is so\nsecond-guess that market that he gets the logs and will\nsell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive\nselling market.\nMR. HAGLUND: We don't have a situation\nhere, Justice Breyer, where Weyerhaeuser presented\nevidence that they were the most efficient and able to\npay higher prices. Weyerhaeuser presented no\nquantitative evidence that it was the lowest cost\nproducer in terms of costs --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What if it were the highest\ncost producer? Suppose still, they think that by buying\nthese logs we later can make a profit when we resell\nthem on the competitive market. You see, the reason\nthey're coming up with this test is they don't think you\ncan give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think\nthat you can produce a better one. So I'm listening.\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, one of the reasons that\none can't go in this direction here, Brooke Group was a\npricing only case. As the briefs make clear and the\ndecision made clear, if that had been a standard\nmonopolization case it would have been out the door on\nsummary judgment because the defendant was a 12 percent\nplayer. They had no prospect of, of attempted or\nmonopolization, a viable monopolization claim. Here we\nhave a situation where Weyerhaeuser's pricing conduct,\ndeliberately and artificially pushing the market up\nthrough a variety of mechanisms, was also interconnected\nand linked to complementary other conduct that we think\nset the table for the effectiveness of their strategy in\nelevating the log market that our client was\nparticipating in.\nBear in mind that, that at JA 901 we have a\nWeyerhaeuser document showing that very significant\nforeclosure from their exclusive contracts in the, in\nOregon for example, this is a document that shows that\n62 percent of the market was covered through either\nexclusive purchase arrangements between Weyerhaeuser and\nlarge landowners, or non-efficiency-based trades were\nthe, were linked to the exchange of the alder sawlogs\nfrom that landowner. Only 33 percent according to JA\n901 show, in Oregon, was projected to be open market\nbidding. Weyerhaeuser acquired, when it was then at a\n65 percent market share, acquired the dominant seller, a\nbuilt-in monopsony in British Columbia and it's five, 15\nto 20-year exclusive forest licenses. That kind of\nforeclosure, linked with the anticompetitive behavior\nthey engaged in that was a variety of bidding practices,\nsome of it was overbuying, some of it was manipulating\nbidding back and forth, and then putting the last bid in\nterms of that cost on the other side.\nI think it's important, I'd like to shift to\nthe instruction again, and make the point that\nWeyerhaeuser never gave either the plaintiff in this\ncase or the district judge the opportunity to consider a\ndifferent instruction than was given here. And the fact\nthat's demonstratively shown if one looks at page 43 of\ntheir opening brief in the Ninth Circuit, in the Ninth\nCircuit they only took the position in the bulk of their\nbrief that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw on the basis of Brooke Group. As to the ground or\nthe contention --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you agree\nthat you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because\nthey were selling these logs at a profit?\nMR. HAGLUND: I didn't quite hear that,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that you\ncould not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test\nbecause Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these\nsales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?\nMR. HAGLUND: We do not agree as to the\nevidence in this case. We have evidence in this case\nthat we cited to in our brief that when you adjust, as\nagainst the Longview mill which our client was literally\nright next door to, when you adjust for the fact that\nWeyerhaeuser supplied half of the raw material needs of\nthe Longview mill at way below market transfer prices,\nwhen you adjust those to the average price they paid\nother third parties for logs, the Longview mill ran at a\nloss for a significant part of the, of the predation\nperiod. We do have the evidence in this case to\ncontend --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's ultimately a jury\nquestion, I assume.\nMR. HAGLUND: If Brooke Group is applied --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that question was not\nput to the jury, right?\nMR. HAGLUND: That's correct. We withdrew\nthe request for a Brooke Group instruction.\nBut to finish my point about the fact that\nthis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then, would you\nbe entitled to a remand on that or not, given that you\nwithdrew that instruction?\nMR. HAGLUND: If the Court concludes the\nBrooke Group applies to this case, then the instruction\nwas incomplete, it was not correct, and we would be\nentitled to a remand and a chance to retry the case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what about the\nrecoupment prong, given that Weyerhaeuser doesn't have\nmarket power in the selling market and that mills were\nentering, new mills were coming on line during this\nperiod. How would you satisfy the recoupment?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, the recoupment is not in\nthe output end of things. The recoupment is the\nopportunity to drive log costs down to recoup the extra\ncosts you pay during the predatory period. And we had\nevidence in the record that a former executive from\nWeyerhaeuser testified that they had used this strategy\nmultiple times, that when it was questioned by some in\ntop management that the head of a division would always\nsay once we either acquire or get rid of a competitor,\nwe will recoup those costs many fold. That's at JA 260,\nCliff Chulos. We also had at JA 903 a planning document\nin 2001 where Weyerhaeuser was showing in that\nPowerPoint chart the expectation that log prices would\nbe going down in '01, '02, '03, and for every 2 percent\nchange downward it was an extra $2 million in profits to\nthe bottom line. There was no plan to pass on the\nbenefits of those lower input prices to consumers.\nObvious consumer lack of benefit in that situation.\nAlso as to recoupment, if you look at JA 831\nto 95, which are the year-end financials for the\nWeyerhaeuser alder mills in Oregon, Washington and BC\nduring a roughly four-year period, you see a monu -- a\nhuge price differential between the prices in British\nColumbia and those prevailing in Oregon and Washington.\nWe think there was every expectation on management's\npart to drive the prices down to the levels that\nprevailed in British Columbia, which works out to about\n$40 million a year, way way above the amount they were\nspending in this predatory scheme predominantly in\nOregon and Washington, because there is no competition\nin British Columbia.\nBut I would like to point out that they\nnever preserved the issue of whether or not the standard\nthat the Ninth Circuit in dictum stated was as a whole\nsufficient to guide the jury as to a definition of\nanticompetitive conduct. At page 43 of their brief\nafter quoting this paragraph they so criticize, they\nnote, although that statement of the law -- this is 43\nof the Ninth Circuit brief, not the blue brief that you\nhave -- although that statement of the law may have been\nacceptable when Reed Brothers was decided, it is not in\nthe wake of Brooke Group for reasons explained above.\nThe point here is that they never made any charge in the\nNinth Circuit that the instruction was flawed\nindependent of Brooke Group. Now we concede, if Brooke\nGroup applies, the instruction was -- was -- is wrong,\nand the case should be reversed and remanded. But the\nsecond point that they try to make in their briefing is\nnot properly preserved. And in fact, I'd like to point\nout that they contributed to the linguistic framework of\nthis instruction in a very significant way. First --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm losing you. What's the\nsecond point that they're trying to make besides the\nfact that this didn't conform to Brooke Group?\nMR. HAGLUND: Well, they have also asserted\nin their briefing that as an independent ground for\nreversal, the instruction was so standardless that the\nverdict cannot stand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Regardless of Brooke Group.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that something\nthat we've got to consider because if, if we disagree\nwith them on Brooke Group, we've got to do it in the\ncourse of making a choice between a Brooke Group\ninstruction and something else, and the only something\nelse we've got right now is what we have in this case\nand we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that\nis good enough.\nMR. HAGLUND: I agree with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And so I mean, I think,\nthey may not have made that an independent basis of\nreversal but we've got to consider it.\nMR. HAGLUND: I agree with that, but I would\nlike to point out these facts in terms of the way they\ncontributed to it. They submitted jury instructions\njust like us based upon the ABA model instructions,\ntheirs are at JA 97 to 122, that used the words outside\nof this paragraph that we are talking about, fair,\nreasonable or necessary 18 times. They showed up 19\ntimes in those instructions. In their opening and\nclosing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'll stipulate to that.\nMR. HAGLUND: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Assuming they don't have a\nleg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face\nwhat the alternative to a Brooke Group kind of\ninstruction is. And -- and however they may have tried\ntheir case, we've still got the same problem.\nMR. HAGLUND: That's correct. And I suggest\nthat you look to the type of formulation I gave a little\nearlier where you're looking at how much did the\ndefendant push the market to levels that are above where\nit otherwise would have been. It's not too far from the\ntest that is proposed by the State at page 29 of their\nbrief where they suggest it's, that the conduct be\nmeasured by whether it raised the price that the buyer's\nrivals had to pay for the input beyond a level that\ncould be justified or explained by other market or\nexogenous factors and substantially affected the ability\nof the buyer's rivals to compete for the input. The\neight States, all of which have concerns both as sellers\ninto these vulnerable resource markets and for citizens\nand companies in their own resource State, laden States,\nwhether it's mineral, whether it's agriculture, they\nhave that concern and they've offered that test that's\nnot too far from what I posited as a way to improve the\ninstruction that Weyerhaeuser invited.\nI'd like to make one further point on\nthat subject and that is, if you look at the opening\nstatement of their counsel, the closing, he used that\nvery language. They were going to put on witnesses who\nwould all state that they never bought more than they\nneeded, they never paid more than necessary. That same\nlitany was put to 13 different witnesses.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Haglund.\nMr. Pincus, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust a couple of points.\nWith respect to the story of how this\ninstruction came to be, in fact it closely resembles\nsome language that was requested by respondent that\nappears on page 93A of the joint appendix which refers\nto a test that paying a price for logs with higher than\nmarket value unnecessarily to drive out or injure\ncompetition. So I do think that this is an instruction\nthat comes from respondent.\nIt's true that we did not request a Brooke\nGroup instruction because the district court had ruled\nthat Brooke Group didn't apply at the summary judgment\nphase. We did object to the instruction proposed by the\ndistrict judge on the grounds that it did not conform\nwith Brooke Group in order to preserve our argument here\nand we believe that that objection gives the Court the\npower to adopt an intermediate rule, but it isn't\nexactly what we requested and there are decisions in the\ncourt of appeals of to that effect.\nWith respect to the question about\npurchasing more logs than they needed, as we say in our\nbriefs we think that that claim can't really be\nseparated from the predatory pricing claim here because\nthe argument is that by purchasing more logs the price\nwas driven up and it's the increased price, that's the\nimpact that respondent complains of. So creating a\nseparate overbuying claim that relies on price for\nimpact would be the same thing as saying on the sell\nside you can have an overselling claim regardless of\nwhether you flunk the Brooke Group standard with respect\nto prices, and that's just going to undercut the\ncertainty that this Court has prescribed.\nWith respect to the document that\nMr. Haglund cited, 901A about the inputs, that document\nis described in testimony in the joint appendix at 571A\nto 573A, and that's a hypothetical look at what the\nmarket might would look like if current, past purchasing\npatterns had continued. It's not a document that in any\nway says that the various sources of log supply were\nlocked up and it doesn't indicate that, and in fact\nthere's nothing in the record to indicate what the\npercentage of logs were that were available to\nWeyerhaeuser by long-term contract, in contrast, as I\nsaid, to the testimony in the record that indicates that\nrespondent got between 30 and 50 percent of its logs\nthrough those long-term sources.\nWith respect to the proper disposition of\nthe case, in the Boyle case this Court made clear that\nwhere there's no, not sufficient evidence in the\nrecord -- I'm sorry, my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nMR. PINCUS: Where there's not sufficient\nevidence in the record to go to the jury under the\nproper jury instruction, the proper outcome is for the\nclaim to be dropped from the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
