        "content": "(10:00 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Today we'll\nbreak for lunch and reconvene at 1:30 and the court\nwill be in recess from today until the first Monday\nin October 2003, at which time the October 2002 term\nof the court will be adjourned and the October 2003\nterm of the court will begin as provided by statute.\nWe'll hear argument now in the Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act cases. Mr. Starr?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR\nON BEHALF OF THE MCCONNELL PLAINTIFFS\nMR. STARR: Mr. Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nTitle I of BCRA, along with Section 213\nintrudes deeply into the political life of the\nnation, and does so in a way that not even the most\nardently nationalist of the founding generation would\nhave countenanced. The upshot is not only a Federal\nintrusion into state and local activity at the\ngrassroots level, but a significant diminution in\nspeech and associational activity by parties,\nactivity that lies at the very core of the First\nAmendment. BCRA's practical effect is to shift\nresources and power away from political parties, which\nhave long been a source of stability for the nation,\nand in the direction of First Amendment-protected,\nbut at times ideologically razor-sharp interest\ngroups.\nBCRA, in a word, goes too far. There were\nother ways before Congress that Congress could have\nemployed. Most relevantly, to the extent that the\nconcern of Congress was large contributions of\nnon-Federal funds, those regulated by the states,\nthen the Hagel amendment was before Congress, which\nwould have put a cap, a ceiling on the level of\ncontributions to the national parties, but preserving\nthe prerogatives of the state and local parties.\nSecondly, to the extent that the concern\nwas contributions being directed toward issue ads,\nCongress had before it the Ney amendment, which among\nits terms provided specifically for the non-use of\nsuch funds in connection with issue ads.\nThirdly, to the extent that Congress was\nconcerned as it clearly was with the abuses of the\nrecent past, as documented lavishly in the Thompson\ncommittee hearings, Congress could and did respond in\nBCRA, in unchallenged parts of BCRA, namely, 302 and\n303, addressing specifically fundraising on Federal\nproperty, clarifying what had been famously said to\nbe a lacuna, namely, no controlling legal authority.\nAlso, tightening the prohibitions on a common abuse\nin the recent past, namely, the involvement and\ncontribution by foreign nationals, the James Riady\nsituation.\nBut Congress chose not to do this. It\nrather, in 323(a), chose to ban, ban, not limit, but\nban, but also to regulate relationships and\nassociations among the different levels of the\nparties. In 323(b), Congress went so far as to\nregulate state and local political activity that is\nat the most grassroots level and is documented\nlavishly in this record, especially with respect to\nthe State of California. The record teems with\nindications that there will be a diminution of\npolitical activity by the political parties, both\nparties, both of the major parties, the California\nDemocratic party and the California Republican party.\nQUESTION: Do I understand your position\nthat Congress could have provided that there be a\nstrong wall between national and state and local\nparties so that no funds could be transferred inter\nse?\nMR. STARR: No, Your Honor. It seems to\nus that the firewall which was described by Senator\nMcCain does in fact intrude into associational\nactivity of parties and the structure of parties that\nthis Court has found protected in a variety of cases\nsuch as EU v. San Francisco County, Tashjian v.\nConnecticut.\nQUESTION: But what -- what's the speech\ninterest if Congress says there can be no transfers\nof funds between different levels of the party, what\nis this First Amendment violation in that? And in\nfact, I thought you were suggesting in your earlier\nremarks that Congress might have done something like\nthis.\nMR. STARR: Well, my point earlier was\nsimply to say there were other alternatives that were\nmore narrowly tailored before Congress, but with\nrespect to transfers themselves, the transfers this\nrecord show go among to other things to enable voter\nmobilization at the most fundamental level and\nactivity, and this again is documented most lavishly\nin California, that is focused upon such as ballot\ninitiatives, quintessential state activity but\nnonetheless which Congress sweeps in under the\nrubric.\nQUESTION: I don't -- I thought that your\nresponse to Justice Kennedy's question was that the\nright to speak includes the right to speak in\nassociation with others. Isn't that the position\nthat your brief takes?\nMR. STARR: That is our position. If I\nfailed to say that, I say it now. The whole idea --\nand I clearly did fail to say it.\nQUESTION: But my question was, could\nCongress allow communications of all type, but not --\nbut forbid transfer of funds between different levels\nof the party?\nMR. STARR: Our position is not\nnon-Federal funds, which by definition are funds that\nare either regulated or subject to regulation by\nstate law.\nQUESTION: May I ask you if you are\ntalking about the right to speak in association with\nothers, does that apply to individuals or does a\ngroup have a right to speak in association with other\ngroups?\nMR. STARR: This -- I believe it does,\nYour Honor, but this Court, I don't think has\nauthoritatively answered that question. Footnote 10\nin Colorado Republican II notes that there are\nindications in the Court's cases, including\nCalifornia Democratic Party v. Jones to the effect\nthat there is in fact an associational right on the\npart of those who have come together as an\nassociation, and that certainly we think is\nconsistent with the teachings of this Court in cases\nsuch as Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Party\nand Tashjian v. Connecticut.\nQUESTION: It's consistent we have never\nheld that, have we?\nMR. STARR: I think it's fair and accurate\nto say that you have not expressly held it. That's\nthe reading, at least, of this Court in footnote\n10\nQUESTION: Mr. Starr?\nMR. STARR: -- as I read it in Colorado\nRepublican II.\nQUESTION: Mr. Starr, may I ask whether\nyou are attacking prior law that required an\nallocation? It didn't say that the state parties\nwere home free. It did say when there were mixed\nactivities, there had to be an allocation and in\npresidential election years, for example, that was\nheavily weighted on the Federal side. Was that in\nyour view constitutional?\nMR. STARR: Certainly an allocation\nprocess, we think, can in fact be contemplated in\nterms of assuring that those funds which are subject\nto state law and state regulation are in fact free to\nbe regulated by the state, and I mean by way of\nspecific example, the people of California, the\npeople of New York have made other contrary\ndeterminations than the Congress did with all respect\nto Congress with respect to certain forms of\ncontributions.\nQUESTION: But I don't -- I don't get in\nwhat you have just said an answer to a question which\nwould affect New York, would affect California, would\naffect every state, 65/35, to take a non-hypothetical\nratio when there are mixed activities, when there are\nFederal and state candidates on the ballot. As I\nunderstand the prior law, it didn't count how many.\nIt just made that allocation. Was that\nconstitutional?\nMR. STARR: I'm not saying that the\nspecific allocation was constitutional or not. That\nwas not tested. But my answer to the question is a\nprocess of accommodation of the state interests is\nnecessary in order, Your Honor, we believe to achieve\nvalues of congruence --\nQUESTION: I think -- I think the question\nthat Justice Ginsburg is getting at is, I gathered\nthe statute was passed because, let's call him Joe\nWealthy, wants to write a check for $10 million to\nhelp his favorite candidate Smith get elected. And\nthey figured out a way, who they is is named in the\nlower court opinion, but we'll just say they. They\nfigured out a way despite the prior law to do it. It\nwould pay for Get Out the Vote, it would pay for\nvoter registration, and it would pay for issue ads\nwhich didn't say vote for Smith. What they said was\nJones, his opponent, is a real rat, go tell him what\nyou think of him, okay.\nI mean, all right, now, that was the\nproblem. And the solution is to say one, all pennies\nspent by the Federal committee are Federal, and\nthough the limitations of $50,000 a year in total\napply. Two, the state is home free, does anything it\nwants where there are only state candidates on the\nballot, that where there are state and Federal both\non the ballot, we will allocate, and then it sets up\na highly complex system of allocation, so I think the\nquestion that I heard was, if you thought the prior\nsystem of allocation which happened to be 60 percent\nFed, 40 percent state or a ratio for the state\ncommittee, depending on the number of state offices\nversus Federal offices.\nIf you felt that was constitutional, then\nwhy is this new allocation unconstitutional, because\nas I read through it, it looked like the basic\nproblem is when you get a voter to the polls, you\nhave to have him there to vote for a state candidate,\nyou have to have him there for a Federal candidate,\nand we are going to allocate the cost of getting him\nthere between hard money, Levin money and maybe some\nother money.\nAll right. That's a long question, but I\nwant its addressing specifically what Justice\nGinsburg raised, which is why if that first\nallocation is okay, why isn't this new allocation\nokay?\nMR. STARR: Several responses. First, let\nme begin with the beginning of your hypothetical,\nlarge contribution from the major donor, the Hagel\namendment addresses that. Now, with respect, that is\nlet's limit the contribution which, after all, is the\nfulcrum of concern, namely, the possibility of\ncorruption, or as this Court articulated in Shrink\nMissouri PAC in Colorado II, undue influence.\nBut there comes a point, Your Honor, where\nCongress goes too far in failing to accommodate the\nstate interest. There is in short a necessary, under\nthis Court's jurisprudence, and we believe anchored\nin the Federal Elections Clause for Congress to\nassiduously be mindful of displacing state law, and\nthat is what has been done here by virtue of\nessentially not even trying to effect an allocation,\nbut rather simply saying, including in context where\nthe flow of funds from the national party to the\nstate or local party is in an off-year election. The\nvalue that we would have left up to the Court is that\nof congruence, proportionality.\nThis goes much too far and Congress could\nhave calibrated much more carefully. When we're talk\n-- we're talking about limits, by the way, I think\nit's fundamental to bear in mind that the limits with\nrespect to Federal contributions are anchored on the\nidea of a contribution as for the purpose of\ninfluencing a state election. What the record shows\nis that there is a substantial amount of donations in\nthe system that go for quintessential state election\nactivity, including ballot measures, initiatives, and\nthe like.\nQUESTION: But to the extent that you are\nchallenging, your challenge is based on the First\nAmendment, then state laws that are similar or even\nmore stringent than the Federal law would also form.\nSo on the one hand, you're saying Congress paid\ninsufficient attention to state interests, but on the\nother hand, your First Amendment argument would\nrequire significant revision of some state laws.\nMR. STARR: Well, I don't think so, Your\nHonor, because what Congress has seen fit to do is\nregulate activity throughout the system, including\nthen a Federal committee's or national committee's\nrelationship with a state and local committee that\nends up affecting what the national committee can do\nin mayoral elections, including in off-year, that is\nto say, non-Federal elections years.\nQUESTION: Of course, some states might\nchoose to make no law abridging the freedom of\nspeech.\nMR. STARR: Well, it's a quaint idea.\nQUESTION: To coin a phrase.\nMR. STARR: And the Commonwealth of\nVirginia has that, and it is a very good system of\ntotal transparency and it's a very vibrant system\nthat is not infected with corruption or the\nappearance of corruption in the view of its Governor\nand others. The Commonwealth of Virginia does in\nfact embrace the idea of transparency. Why? Because\nthis court stated in Buckley that a contribution is a\nFirst Amendment event. It does have significance.\nBut we have now gone beyond that which Congress has\nheld by this court in Buckley years ago to have an\ninterest in and that is the regulation of\ncontributions for the purpose of influencing --\nthat's the definition -- a federal election.\nQUESTION: I'm still curious about the\nresponse, Mr. Starr, to that inquiry about whether\nyour arguments would apply and lead you to think that\nthe pre-BCRA regime is invalid as well.\nMR. STARR: No, we are not suggesting that\nthe FEC regime was invalid, and we think that --\nQUESTION: That nothing about it was, the\nallocation and so forth.\nMR. STARR: We're not suggesting it. The\nissue was never authoritatively resolved.\nQUESTION: No, but would your argument\nlead you to conclude that maybe that scheme that's\nbeen there for 25 years is invalid?\nMR. STARR: Not at all, because what the\nFEC did for all those years, and they're settled\nexpectations that were built upon that system, was a\nrecognition of the state's prerogatives. This is\nvery powerfully expressed in the FEC's 20-year\nreport, which speaks about our Federal system and the\nvery idea, and therefore, declining to use the\npejorative term, quote, soft money, because other\nstates have different attitudes.\nQUESTION: But as I understand it, your\ncriterion for drawing the line at what is a\nlegitimate state interest is the proportionality and\ncongruence criterion, is that correct?\nMR. STARR: I think that is instructive as\nto what --\nQUESTION: And how do you factor into the\napplication of that criterion, the basic argument\nmade on the other side in this case, that if you do\nnot allow what Congress has done here, you are, in\neffect, allowing a complete end run around the prior\nlaw? How does that factor into congruence and\nproportionality? Do we ignore it?\nMR. STARR: No, Your Honor, because again,\nJustice Souter, Congress had before it -- if the\nproblem was these large donations giving rise to the\nappearance of corruption or undue influence --\nQUESTION: Large donations or a thousand\nsmaller donations? The end run problem is exactly\nthe same. And one reason I suppose it's the same is\nthe argument that you made, and that is the close\nassociation between the state and the national\ncommittees. And I don't see how your argument\naddresses that.\nMR. STARR: But Your Honor, we think it\ndoes in terms of simply recognizing the traditional\ninterests of the states that we think is, again,\nanchored in the Elections Clause itself that Congress\nsimply does not have authority. And this Court's\nteaching in terms limits I think is to the sane\neffect, that Congress simply lacks authority even if\nit, quote, sees a problem which it has seen in\nMorrison and Lopez and a variety of cases that\nCongress can go in our Federal system too far.\nAnd that's even in the context of the\nCommerce Clause.\nto a quintessential sovereign interest of the states.\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Starr.\nMr. Burchfield, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BOBBY R. BURCHFIELD\nON BEHALF OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PLAINTIFFS\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nTitle I is both fatally overbroad in\nachieving any Federal interest and nonsensically\nunderinclusive. To paraphrase the Court in National\nConservative PAC, we are not here quibbling about\nfine-tuning prophylactic measures. We are here\nchallenging fundamental restrictions on core\npolitical party activities. Indeed the Court noted\nin Buckley that no societal interests would be\nachieved if a loophole closing measure allowed\nunscrupulous persons and organizations to spend\nunlimited amounts to influence a Federal candidate.\nJoe Wealthy is George Soros, Justice\nBreyer, who the media reports --\nQUESTION: $10,000,000 and Get Out The\nVote --\nMR. BURCHFIELD: And totally unregulated.\nQUESTION: But we'll see how that works\nbecause the second they start conferring with any\ncandidate or they start conferring with the political\nparty, they're going to be in a lot of trouble. So I\nguess it still is possible that a person could have a\ntotally uncoordinated private effort to Get Out the\nVote and give a lot of money to it.\nBut the general rule of constitutional law\nand every other law is Congress doesn't have to solve\nevery problem. And we don't know yet whether that\nwill turn out to be a big loophole.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Correct, Justice Breyer.\nBut we know from Colorado I that not all activities\nof political parties are coordinated with their\ncandidates and we know from the current regime, from\nthe regime that has been in effect for more than a\ndecade, that all donations to political parties,\nFederal money, non-Federal money or anything else, is\nfully disclosed and reported. So at least under the\nsystem that we have had with political parties, the\npolitical parties are accountable and are\ntransparent.\nLet me say a few words about the\nallocation regulations, just to make sure that we're\nall clear about what the allocation regulations do\nand -- did and do not do. In the 15.6 million\ndollars of non-Federal money that the Republican\nNational Committee spent in the 2001 off-year\nelection, when there were no Federal candidates on\nthe ballot --\nQUESTION: When you say off-year, you mean\ngovernor elections in Virginia and New Jersey and\nlike that?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly, when there were\nno Federal candidates on the ballot, odd-year\nelections. The allocation regulations allowed the\nRNC to spend whatever it could raise and whatever it\nwanted to spend subject to state law. The allocation\nregulations did not apply. That is a perfect\naccommodation, in our view, of the state interest, of\nthe state interest in regulating its own electoral\naffairs.\nQUESTION: How did the 65 percent/35\npercent in the Presidential year accommodate state\ninterests?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: In a presidential year,\nYour Honor, the FEC, after much deliberation, made\nthe determination that the national parties would be\npresumptively more involved in Federal elections\nthose years than in state elections. But they still\nrecognized -- the FEC has still recognized that the\nnational parties are, in fact, national parties, not\nFederal parties, and therefore, they can spend 35\npercent on allocable activities, even in a Federal\nelection year as in 2000 when the RNC gave $5.6\nmillion of non-Federal money to state and local\ncandidates. That money is not subject to the\nallocation regulations.\nQUESTION: You assert the principle,\nhowever, that the Federal government may regulate any\nactivity which has an effect on Federal elections?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, I think the\nCourt put it well in Siebold over a century ago when\nit said, for those activities that had exclusive\nreference to a state election, the Federal government\nhas no role. But when there are joint activities\nthat have an effect on both elections, the regulating\nentity, state government or Federal government,\ncannot impair or nullify -- is the term the Court\nused then -- impair or nullify the other sovereign's\ninterest.\nQUESTION: I suppose getting a governor\nelected or getting a state legislature elected, which\nwill establish electoral districts within the state\nin a certain fashion, which will be used for the\nFederal election as well, I suppose that that would\nhave an effect on the Federal election, wouldn't it?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: So every state election has an\neffect on Federal elections.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, that is the\nSolicitor General's position here. It is a boundless\nproposition that leaves the states no room to\nlegislate on their own elections because they\ncontend -- you're exactly right.\nQUESTION: So in order to avoid that\nboundless proposition, it seems to me you cannot\naccept the view that whatever affects Federal\nelections can be regulated.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: I do accept that\nproposition.\nQUESTION: You do accept it?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: I do accept that\nproposition.\nQUESTION: Well, then what the Solicitor\nGeneral says is quite correct. State elections\naffect Federal elections, so state elections can be\nregulated.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, there is a certain\npoint at which the effect becomes so attenuated that\nthe sovereign interests of the state becomes\nparamount.\nQUESTION: So you do not accept the\nproposition that whatever affects Federal regulations\ncan be regulated.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: I would say it has to be\nexclusive reference under the Siebold regime, Your\nHonor. If it's a direct donation to a state\ncandidate, if it is a Get Out the Vote phone bank\nthat advocates that the voters go to the poll and\nvote for the governor, if it is a mailing, as under\nthe California -- as the California party affidavits\nof Ms. Bowler and Mr. Irwin indicate, that they\nsend --\nQUESTION: The reason that I take it that\n(a) says that all money spent by a national committee\nis hard money is because Congress is interested in\nthe contribution, not the expenditure. And what\nthey're saying is if you write a check for one penny\nor you write a check for 50 billion to the Republican\nor Democratic National Committee, we assume that that\nmoney is going to be used to affect Federal\nelections.\nNow, you are right that a small portion\nis, in fact, used just for state. A portion. 9\nmillion out of 300 million, something like that. But\nit's simply too hard for us to know, contribution by\ncontribution, what's going to do what. And the only\nworkable rule here is not to prevent the RNC from\nusing its money on state elections, but to say to the\nRNC, every penny that you spend because you're a\nnational committee must follow Federal source and\namount limitations.\nSo it's an administrative reason, it\nfocuses on the contribution, and it focuses on the\nnature of a national political committee. That's\ntheir justification, I think.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, allow me to\ndisagree with that justification. 323(a) prohibits\nthe solicitation, receipt, direction, transfer and\nspending. It's a felony for the chairman of the RNC\ntoday to send a fund-raising letter asking for $100\ndonation to any of the California gubernatorial\ncandidates.\nQUESTION: Can't they spend as much\nmoney -- and here I'm not positive. I thought, but\nit's complicated, that the RNC can write a check for\na million dollars if it wanted, or whatever the\namount is, as long as it's hard money. It's that\nthey're forbidden from soliciting or spending, et\ncetera, money that isn't hard money.\nabout that or not?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: The RNC can spend as much\nhard money in state elections, consistent with state\nlaw and in some states, in Connecticut, such as --\nand that's set forth in Mr. Josefiak's affidavit,\nwhere it's not even clear that the national parties\ncan participate because the national -- the Federal\nlimits are higher than the state limits. And there\nare some states where the national party under this\nregime is going to be constrained to participate even\nin state elections --\nQUESTION: And then the reason, I take it,\nfor that is the administrative reason I gave, we're\nfocusing on the contributions. And now what is your\nresponse to that?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: The response to that,\nYour Honor, is that the statute speaks far more\nbroadly than contributions.\nQUESTION: Isn't there also an answer to\nthat general line, that when you're talking about the\nFirst Amendment, administrative considerations\nordinarily are not good enough.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly, Your Honor. And\nit's also worth noting here that the allocation\nregulations that the senatorial or congressional\ncommittees operate under are governed by the actual\namounts spent on state and local activity, subject to\na percentage of a 60 percent cap.\nIf they don't engage in at least 40\npercent state election activity, their Federal\npercentage is higher than 60 percent. So that the\nallocation ratios are calibrated to address, in the\nreal world, what the parties are actually doing in\nthe state and local realm.\nQUESTION: That's an administrative\nconvenience.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: It is an administrative\nconvenience.\nQUESTION: And that's okay.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: But there's other\nadministrative conveniences not okay.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: So you can't be relying on the\nprinciple that administrative convenience is not\nadequate.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Justice Scalia, we are\nnot here today to defend the constitutionality of the\nallocation regulations, but I did sense that there\nmight be some misunderstanding about how they\noperated, and I wanted to at least make clear that\nthe allocation regulations do not purport -- did not\npurport to regulate purely state and local candidate\nactivity, at the national party level or at the state\nparty level.\nA very large proportion of what the\nCalifornia Democratic and Republican parties do was\nnot within the scope of the allocation regulations.\nHere, under this statute, under section 323(b), the\nonly activities in even years that state and local\nparties can engage in, according to Ms. Bowler's\naffidavit -- she's the executive director of the\nCalifornia Democratic Party -- are direct donations\nto candidates, to state and local candidates, and\nstate party conventions.\nEverything else, including a phone bank to\noppose a school voucher initiative such as Prop. 38\nthat was on the November 2000 ballot, and that's in\nthe Joint Appendix at 1721, the actual phone banks\nclip, that is completely Federalized today. But the\nNational Education Association can run that very same\nphone bank with totally unregulated money today.\nQUESTION: In order to rule for you on all\nof the issues that are presented in Title I -- let's\njust talk about Title I. Do we have to cut back on\nthe second rationale given in Buckley, the\nendorsement speech is of low value? Or can we accept\nBuckley on its face for all that it says and still\nrule for you on every one of these points?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, we have\nbriefed this matter, and after due consideration, we\nbelieve that this statute can and should be struck\ndown consistent with the Buckley line of cases.\nBecause it does go too far. Section 323(a) the\nnational party prohibition is a restriction\nregardless of whether the amounts are coordinated or\nuncoordinated, a principle from the Buckley cases.\nWhether it's individual or corporate\nmoney, whether it is -- whether it is a large\ndonation or a small donation, any, any amount of\nmoney that the national parties are involved with\nthat is not subject to the limitations, prohibitions,\nand reporting requirements of Federal law, FECA, is a\ncrime, it is a --\nQUESTION: The -- the difficulty,\nMr. Burchfield, that I have with your argument, I\nknow where you are going, but the difficulty I have\nis in determining what the criterion is going to be.\nIf we accept the Buckley standard, which you do, for\nthe purpose of your argument, then it seems to me\nyour criterion for applying the Buckley standard is\nsimilar to what Mr. Starr was getting, getting at.\nYou say it goes too far. And we have said over and\nover again when we are applying that standard, we\ndon't have a scalpel, and I don't know how we apply a\ntoo-far or not-too-far standard.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, under --\nunder strict scrutiny, which we believe is certainly\napplicable here, because this is not a contribution\nlimit --\nQUESTION: No, but with respect, I know\nyou are arguing that, but I also understood your\nanswer to Justice Kennedy's question to be that even\nif we take the lesser, the more relaxed criterion\nunder Buckley, that you also win and you win on a\nstandard that it goes too far, and my problem is\nassuming all of those things, I don't see how we\napply a too-far standard.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, Your Honor, first\nof all, under strict scrutiny, the Government doesn't\neven argue this statute can pass strict scrutiny, so\nif the Court, as we submit that it should, since\nthese, since these restrictions go to the very\nessence of what political parties do --\nQUESTION: I -- I realize that argument.\nI just want to get at the -- your answer to Justice\nKennedy, which was even if you apply the more\ncomplacent standard, we win. That's the, that's the\nassumption of my question.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: And in fact, as we have\nset forth in our reply brief, we believe that we do\nwin if even the more complacent standard is applied.\nQUESTION: Because we have a too-far\nstandard that we apply under win under a too-far\nstandard?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Because Congress has to\nmake an effort, Justice Souter, to closely draw the\nstatute to address the ill that it is trying to\naddress. A $100 donation solicited by the chairman\nof the RNC to a California gubernatorial candidate is\nnot prohibiting that, making that a felony, is not\nclosely drawn. Prohibiting the Republican National\nCommittee from, from, from raising money consistent\nwith the state law in Virginia and donating millions\nof dollars in 2001 in the state elections in\nVirginia, there's no Federal interest in that.\nThat's --\nQUESTION: But it doesn't, you see, it\ndoesn't prohibit their donating it.\nwhat they want, I heard you say. It's just that they\nhave to donate it out of hard money and so what the\nstatute is actually saying is that any penny that you\ngive to a national political committee, we assume, is\na penny that will, or is intended to or will\ninfluence a Federal election.\nNow, now that's -- why is that an\nunreasonable assumption to make? Because after all,\neven if that committee were to take your money and\nuse it for the purposes you are talking about, that\nwould free up some other money for the other\npurposes. And so Congress has made the assumption I\nsaid.\nNow, all I'm doing is going through all\nthe reply briefs because the reply briefs take each\nof your examples and they try to explain what it was\nthat Congress had in mind. So it would help me if\nyou, you know, sort of start with the assumption. I\nknow your argument, I think. And I think I know the\nreply, and what do you want to say about that?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: There, it is, it shows no\nesteem for the Commonwealth of Virginia regulating\nits own state elections to tell a national political\nparty or anyone else that it must comply with Federal\nstandards in order to participate in a purely state\nelection activity when there are no Federal\ncandidates on the ballot.\nQUESTION: The problem I'm having is it\nseems to me that you are bringing out the Federalism\nargument and we were talking about the speech\nargument. Let's assume the Attorney General is going\nto prevail and the Federal Government has power to\nregulate. Still is a First Amendment problem.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Is there a First Amendment\nanswer that you can give to Justice Breyer?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: The statute has to be\nnarrowly tailored, we contend, but at least closely\ndrawn to pursue the Federal interest.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. --\nMR. BURCHFIELD: And here, and here --\nQUESTION: But Justice Breyer's principal\npoint was that there, that there's no restriction on\nthe national parties expending funds. They just have\nto expend Federal money, and not, not state money,\nso-called hard money. Now, I assume that your\nresponse to that is that it would be a restriction\nupon my speech if a law were passed which said Scalia\ncan take out advertisements in newspapers, but not\nwith money from his salary.\nuse other funds. Would that not be a restriction of\nmy speech?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: It would, Your Honor.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: But isn't it -- the reason it\nis such a restriction is that Justice Scalia is\nlimited in what he can raise in money beyond his\nsalary, and the national parties are not?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: The -- the national --\nQUESTION: They can raise more money if\nthey want to.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: The -- the national\nparties are constrained by, are constrained by\nFederal statute purportedly pursuing a Federal\ninterest in, in their activities relating to a\nFederal, to a state and local election. It has been\na touchstone of the campaign finance statute since\nthe Tillman Act in 1907 that the activity, the\ncontribution even, has to be, has to be directed to\ninfluencing or for the purpose of influencing or\ndirected to a Federal election.\nQUESTION: Mr. Burch --\nMR. BURCHFIELD: This is the first time\nCongress has abandoned that touchstone.\nQUESTION:\nof a basic question, maybe it's assumed here, but\ndirecting your attention to 323(a) in the general\npoint of 323(a), do you think a Federal statute would\nbe constitutional if it simply said national\npolitical parties may not accept any contributions\nfrom profit-making corporations?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: I believe that would be\nunconstitutional, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That would be unconstitutional?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Under the Federalism,\nunder our Federalism argument, that would be\nunconstitutional, as well as --\nQUESTION: I think that's the heart of\nyour position, and I think it's unsupported by our\ncases.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, Your Honor, under\nthe Buckley line of cases, you have never addressed a\nFederalism issue before because the currently, the\ncurrently existing, the pre-existing campaign finance\nstatutes were by their terms limited to contributions\nfor the purpose of influencing a Federal election.\nQUESTION: But in a sense, there is a\nparallel argument there that Buckley says what are\nthe interests that the Government may rely on in\nrestricting speech, and it says the appearance\nof corruption, corruption, and so in a way, to the\nextent that the Government gets away from that at all\nin going to some other interests, you can say it's a\nFederalist -- Federalism argument, but it's also a\nFirst Amendment argument in the sense that if those\nexist, if those interests are not there, then it's a\nFirst Amendment difficulty.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly. It's a First\nAmendment issue if the Federal Government is\npurporting to pursue an interest, an interest that\nisn't a legitimate Federal interest. Your Honor, if\nI may say --\nQUESTION: Again, Mr. -- Mr. Burchfield,\nwhen I come back to the question I asked Mr. Starr,\nto the extent that you are relying on the First\nAmendment, you can't be waiving a Federalism banner\nbecause that would affect, you spoke about some state\nlaws just a moment ago, I think you mentioned,\nConnecticut --\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Connecticut.\nQUESTION: -- being more stringent than\nthe Federal regulation.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, under the\nprior regime, the Republican National Committee had\n12 separate accounts that it ran that were in\ncompliance with the various permutations of state\nlaw, so that when it wanted to participate in\nConnecticut, for example, it had\nConnecticut-compliant money to do so.\nUnder this regime, it has one account, and\none account only, and that is the Federal account,\nand with that, when that account contains donations\nthat are, that are of a level higher than the, than\nthe state it wants to participate in, there is a\nproblem. Now, the states have not worked their way\nthrough that.\nQUESTION: But quite, quite apart from\nthe, the allocation problem, to pursue Justice\nGinsburg's inquiry because it's something I'm\ninterested as well, suppose that we rule for you on\nall of these issues under Title I, and we do so on a\nFirst Amendment rationale.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Right.\nQUESTION: Are we then striking down the\nlaws of any states and if so, how many?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, I do not\nbelieve you would be striking down any states. We\nhave argued here that the, the problems with 323A,\nthe national party prohibition is that it is an\nacross-the-board criminal prohibition of all RNC\nactivity. No -- unless it's regulated by Federal\nhard money contributions, if you will, no state in\nthe union has such a broad, has such a broad statute,\nand if, if they did we would be in court the next day\nchallenging it. 323(b), the restrictions on state\nparties, usurps state law by imposing this Orwellian\ndefinition of Federal election activity which sweeps\nin virtually, virtually all activities of the state\nparties during even years, subjects it to a Federal\n$10,000 limit and then perhaps most invasively\nimposes the homegrown requirement which makes it\ndifficult, if not impossible, for states to transfer\nmoney among themselves.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, the reason it\ndoes that, I mean, on the first part, I guess if you\nwon, you would find a donor who was wanting to give\nmoney to the RNC just to help the state. And you\nwant him to be able to write his check for 9 million.\nWell, you are talking about 9 million I guess out of\nseveral hundred million, so I don't know if you won\non that, it would help you that much, if you really\ngot just what you wanted there.\nBut now you are going to the second part,\nand on the second part, the way Congress has done\nthis is it says, after all, we understand that state\nparties in an election with Federal candidates on the\nballot, have an interest in getting state candidates\nelected and Federal candidates, and so we will\nallocate, and I, and then contrary, I think, to what\nI heard Mr. Starr say, I think they produce one of\nthe most complex allocation systems I have ever read.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: They have indeed.\nQUESTION: Now, the fact that it's complex\ndoesn't mean it's wrong. What they are trying to do\nis balance a lot of different interests, so now you\nexplain to me what's wrong with it, what they've\ntried to do is allocate the cost of getting the voter\nto the polls between some special state money and\nbetween Federal hard money, and they have their\nreasons, I think, as you have seen from the reply\nbrief, for each one of the special restrictions\nthat's in there.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, I would be\nhappy to explain, to explain to you what's wrong with\nSection 323(b) if that is what I understand your\nquestion to be.\nQUESTION: Well, no, you wanted to bring,\nyou wanted to discuss that. I'm saying if you want,\ndo want to discuss it, I'd certainly be interested.\nMR. BURCHFIELD:\nabsolutely do. What is wrong with 323(b) in the\nFirst Amendment realm is that it does restrict the\nability of state and local parties, as well as\nnational parties to pool their resources. There was\na question earlier about whether there's ever been,\nwhether there's ever been a recognition of the right\nto pool resources. Absolutely. In Buckley at pages\n65 and 66, the right to join together for the\nadvancement of beliefs and ideas, quote, is diluted\nif it does not include the right to pool money\nthrough contributions for funds are often essential\nif advocacy is to be truly or optimally affected.\nThe state and local and national parties\nannually pool their resources for voter mobilization\nplans to get their voters to the polls. Under the\nLevin amendment, which is immensely complicated,\nunder the Levin amendment, the committee that spends\nthe money has to raise 100 percent of it, both the\nFederal component and the non-Federal component.\nUnder the Levin amendment, it is illegal for the\nnational parties to send even a Federal dollar to a\nstate or local party in order to, in order to\nparticipate in a, in a joint Get Out the Vote program\nthat the state is funding in part with Levin.\nQUESTION: Now, their reason for that,\ntheir reason for that, I take it, is because Joe\nRich, who wants to write the check for 6 million,\nwhen faced with this statute and the Levin amendment,\nwhich allows him to give $10,000 to each district\ncommittee, the Western Sunset Block Association of\nthe Democratic Party. The -- there could be\nthousands of such associations, and since there could\nbe thousands, if they did not have that restriction,\nall that would happen is that the state committee\nwould write to Mr. Joe Rich and say write the check\nfor $6 million to me, and then what he'd do is he\nwould divide that $6 million up among our 10,000\nlocal committees, and you see, it would be a hole\nthat is not just an inch wide, but 15 miles wide, and\nso they threw some sand in those gears. And the sand\nin those gears is just what you described.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, Your Honor, bear in\nmind that the Levin Amendment, restricts, the homegrown\nrequirement not just Joe Wealthy's -- sending Joe\nWealthy's donation. It restricts sending Joe Poor\nPerson's\n$10 donation down to the states. It restricts sending\neven\nFederal money, noncorrupting Federal money down to the\nstates. In that sense, it certainly goes too far.\nBut I would also say -- point out with\nregard to the Levin Amendment, Mr. Tamraz, who has\nmade his appearance in these briefs, as he did in the\nThompson committee, gave $300,000 to state parties in\n1996. And that's supposedly the reason they\npassed -- one of the reasons they passed this\nstatute. He can give, in California, $10,000 to each\nof the 58 California county committees and $10,000 to\nthe California state committee for a total of\n$590,000 in California. And that is wholly -- that\nis not Federal money. That is Levin money.\nBut the national party committees cannot\ntransfer even down $10 to the state party for a voter\nmobilization plan. That is not -- I would\nrespectfully submit, Your Honor, that's neither\nnarrowly tailored nor closely drawn, not even\nrational.\nQUESTION: They're going to say -- there\nis still -- the reason -- to get that 10,000 to each\nof these things, at least they have to act\nindependently. And they're trying to make that local\ncommittee independent, and independent even of the\nFederal money.\nMR. BURCHFIELD:\ntrying to make the local parties independent of each\nother is that those 58 California parties cannot pool\ntheir resources for a statewide Get Out the Vote\nprogram, Justice Breyer. And the Democratic National\nCommittee on that side of the aisle, the Republican\nNational Committee on our side of the aisle is\nsitting in the hallway.\nAnd that is a fundamental wedge between\nthe associational rights, political parties in an\narea that even Senator McCain admits is fundamental\nto the democratic process.\nThat is -- if I may just for a moment to\nexpound upon that. For that reason alone, we believe\nthat strict scrutiny is absolutely essential in this\ncase, and the government confirms that they cannot\npass the strict scrutiny bar.\nQUESTION: Mr. Burchfield, can I just be\nsure that I understand one thing? You're saying the\nFederal -- national committee may not transfer any\nmoney to the local committee in that situation. But\ndoesn't the statute merely say it must transfer hard\nmoney?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: No, Your Honor. If the\nstate committee is using Levin money, they can accept\nno transfers.\npercent of their money for that\nprogram must be homegrown.\nQUESTION: Which provision -- you're not\nrelying on 323(b)(1).\nMR. BURCHFIELD: It is 323 -- and pardon\nme because the statute has --\nQUESTION: (b)(1) just prohibits transfer\nof anything except hard money.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: It's (b)(2)(B)(iv), and\n323(b)(2)(C). And (b)(4) and 323(b)(2)(B)(iv), it\nsays the amounts expended or disbursed are made\nsolely from the funds raised by the state, local or\ndistrict committee which makes such expenditure or\ndisbursement and do not include any funds provided to\nsuch committee --\nQUESTION: That's a condition to using\nLevin funds.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But the basic prohibition in\n(b) is just a prohibition on the use of any money\nother than the hard money.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: And Congress\nrecognizes --\nQUESTION: So it's only if you get to the\nLevin Amendment that your argument is relevant.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, Senator\nLevin, when he proposed the Levin Amendments --\nQUESTION: Let me just be sure we're\nunderstanding each other and what the statute\nprovides.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is it not true that the basic\nprohibition in (b) does not prevent a national party\nfrom transferring hard money to local committees for\nany purpose whatsoever?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: So long as the local\nparties are not using the Levin Amendment, that's\nexactly right.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Correct.\nQUESTION: But it does prohibit it when\nthey're using Levin money.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: But if they are using\nLevin money, it's a crime.\nQUESTION: But the statute doesn't require\nthem to use Levin money, so they do have an option to\ntransfer hard money to local committees.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: If the entire political\nprocess at the state level is subjected to the hard\nmoney limits, you're right, Your Honor. But Senator\nLevin, on the day he introduced the Levin Amendment,\nsaid that the statute would go too far. It would go\ntoo far as written without the Levin Amendment in\nregulating, quoting, some of the most core activities\nthat state and local parties engage in. So the Levin\nAmendment is not --\nQUESTION: So it still remains true that\nthe use of Levin funds is an option to the national\nparty, not a requirement.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, it was an option --\nQUESTION: Is that not correct?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: That is correct. But\nJustice Stevens, it is an option that Congress\nunderstood was essential to the vitality of the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Excuse me, is it an option for\nthe national party or for the state?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: It's not an option for\nthe national party.\nQUESTION: It's an option for the state\nparty.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Exactly.\nQUESTION: So a state party could destroy\nthe --\nQUESTION: It's an option for the national\nparty because 323(b) is directed at the national\nparties.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: 323(a) is directed to the\nnational parties.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry, you're right, it's a\nstate thing.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: And 323(a), as we've\nindicated, is an across the board criminal ban on\nnational parties accepting any money that is not\nstrictly regulated by FECA.\nQUESTION: Strictly regulated means that\nthey, in order to raise the same amount of money,\nthey couldn't rely on corporate treasuries, union\ntreasuries and rich donors. They would have to\nspread their effort more widely to reach the ordinary\npeople who support a party.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: They would have to file a\nFederal committee, engage in Federal reporting and\ncomply with all the restrictions.\nQUESTION: But what it would cut out is\nthe reliance on corporate funds, union funds and\nwealthy individuals. The parties would have to\nspread their efforts more widely, but that's\nbasically what it calls for. There is no limit,\nthere is no ceiling on the amount of the money that\nthey could raise.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Your Honor, if the only\nword in 323(a) were receive, you would be right. But\nI respectfully -- I respectfully refer you to the\nfact that the statute prohibits soliciting,\nreceiving, transferring, directing or spending, and\nCongress intended meaning to those other verbs --\nQUESTION: But if you can't receive, how\ncan you solicit? If you can't receive, how can you\ntransfer?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: You can solicit for\ngubernatorial candidates, you can solicit for state\nparties, you can collaborate with state parties in\nspending money the way the political parties have\ndone heretofore in voter mobilization plans.\nQUESTION: In which case, the limitation\non receiving is simply a formal limitation.\nEverybody knows where the money comes from, everybody\nknows what the money is supposed to be used for. So\nthat if your argument to Justice Ginsburg is good, I\nthink the argument for regulation is all over.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Well, Your Honor, I would\nrespectfully disagree. Under the Court's\ncontribution to candidate lines of cases, putting\naside the question that we're talking about\ncontributions to political parties, and not directly\nto candidates here. But under the contribution to\ncandidate line of cases, those cases do not involve\nsolicitation of contributions to others, such as the\nchairman of the RNC's ability to solicit money for\nsomeone running in the California recall election\nright now.\nQUESTION: I don't want you to leave\nwithout having a chance to -- but I've listed so far,\nand so far it's not going to kill the statute. So\nfar you're upset about that Roman numeral II -- you\nknow what I'm talking about?\nMR. BURCHFIELD: The homegrown\nrequirement?\nQUESTION: Roman numeral II on the\nhomegrown which is the Federal contribution to hard\nmoney. That's your strongest argument there, I\nthink. So you say strike that from the statute. All\nright, we take out Roman numeral II, that's not going\nto kill the statute.\nAnd as far as the first point is\nconcerned, at worst, concerning you're completely\nright -- assuming you're right, you could set up\ntotally segregated accounts for donors who want to\ngive to the Federal party to money that will be used\nfor purely state elections.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: National parties, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Yes, national parties. You\ncould do that, right, and without hurting the statute\ntoo much. Now, is there a third or fourth -- I want\nto be sure I get down what you think are the biggest\nthree or four overly broad things.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: May I answer as you go?\nWith regard to 323(b), the statute does pervasively\nregulate state parties from section 323(a) on. In\nour briefs, we set forward the overbroad definition,\nthe Orwellian definition of Federal election activity\nwhich is fundamental to section 323(b). I don't\nbelieve you can solve 323(b) without going to the\nvery core of the statute.\nWith regard to section 323(a) and setting\nup separate accounts, you've described the situation\nbefore the statute was formed. Now, are there\nways -- are there regulatory ways that Congress could\nhave gone in more closely or more narrowly and\nlimited the ability of national parties to spend\nmoney coming out of those non-Federal accounts, those\n12 non-Federal accounts? Perhaps, but that isn't\nwhat Congress did here, Justice Breyer.\nCongress here adopted an across the board\ncriminal prohibition on national political party\ninvolvement with any money that is not regulated by\nthe Federal government. And that we contend goes too\nfar.\nNow, as to the other overbreadths of the\nstatute, I would simply rely upon what we've set\nforth in the briefs. Thank you, Your Honors.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Burchfield.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you. Sometime in your\nargument, would you cover the question of whether, if\nthe Court were to strike down 323(a), 323(b) could\nsurvive?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL DEFENDANTS\nMR. OLSON: Well, we believe it could,\nMr. Chief justice, but let me come back to that.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThe issues the Court considers today,\nevery single one of them in connection with Title I,\nare not new.\nFor a century, with the overwhelming\nsupport of the public, Congress has struggled to curb\nthe corrupting influence of corporate, union and\nlarge, unregulated contributions in Federal\nelections. Time and time again, this Court has\nagreed that achievement of that goal is critical to\navoid erosion of public confidence in representative\ngovernment to -- and I'm using the Court's words --\nto a disastrous extent.\nBut concentrated wealth is nothing if not\ncreative. As this Court has observed, the history of\ncampaign finance reform has been a cycle of\nlegislation followed by the invention and\nexploitation of loopholes, followed by more\nlegislation to cut off the most egregious evasions\nand circumventions.\nQUESTION: General Olson, is every problem\nsoluble?\nMR. OLSON: Well, this Court hasn't found\nevery problem to be solvable.\nQUESTION: If for example, the executive\nshould make a compelling case that it is really\nimpossible to eradicate crime if we continue with\nthis silly procedure of having warrants for searches\nof houses? We wouldn't entertain the argument that,\nyou know, this is the only way to achieve this\nresult.\nMR. OLSON: Of course not.\nQUESTION:\naren't there, even if problems subsist? There are\njust some things that government can't do?\nMR. OLSON: Of course, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: And that's what we're arguing\nhere.\nMR. OLSON: Of course it is.\nQUESTION: Not whether there are problems.\nMR. OLSON: Of course it is.\nQUESTION: But whether this is something\nthat government simply can't do.\nMR. OLSON: Of course it is, but this\nCourt has said over and over again, not only is it a\ncritical problem that's fundamental to the integrity\nof our election system, but that the solutions that\nthe legislature has enacted before, the central\nprinciples of which are embodied in BCRA, are\nconstitutional solutions to that problem.\nQUESTION: Let me understand -- to be very\nbasic, let's start with the text. Congress shall\nmake no law abridging the freedom of speech.\nCongress shall make no law abridging the freedom of\nspeech. These laws abridge the freedom of speech in\nsome sense.\nNow, on what basis do you think that there\nis somehow a way around that text? I can think of\nseveral ones. You can say the freedom of speech\ndoesn't mean all freedom of speech. It means that\nfreedom of speech which was traditional at the time\nthe provision was adopted. So you could not libel,\nyou could not give information about the sailing of\ntroop ships and whatnot. But this wouldn't come\nunder that. There was no notion of restraining\nexpenditures for campaigning when the provision was\nadopted.\nA second alternative, I suppose, is that\nthe freedom of speech does not include freedom of\nspeech by malefactors of great wealth, corporations,\nlabor unions and other organizations don't have\nfreedom of speech. But our cases reject that. We\ncan't require The New York Times to be -- you know,\nany organization that is funded by more than a\nmillion dollars cannot say anything about elections.\nWe couldn't say that, could we?\nSo how do you get around the very simple\ntext of the First Amendment?\nMR. OLSON: What Congress has done is read\nthe decisions of this Court from 1976, and including\nthe earlier decisions, that specifically said and\nhave said over and over again, that the regulations\nof contributions, contributions where you're talking\nabout contributions, not expenditures. This Court\nhas said the regulations of contributions to the\nFederal election process by unions and by\ncorporations may be controlled by Congress in Federal\nlegislation, in connection with Federal elections.\nThis Court has said that over and over again. And\nthis Court said in Buckley --\nQUESTION: That's plausible, I suppose,\nthat a contribution to somebody else, to speak\nwhatever he wants, is not your speech. But what do\nyou do about expenditures? This law regulates a lot\nof expenditures.\nMR. OLSON: This law, referring to Title\nI, makes certain contributions illegal to the\nFederal -- to the national parties and to their\nconduits and surrogates. Contributions from unions,\ncorporations in excess of certain limits. Of course\nit says that once it said that the contribution is\nillegal, the solicitation of the contribution is\ncomparably illegal. And the expenditure of that\ncontribution, not any amount of money that the\nFederal or state committees might want to spend, but\nthe use of that money from that source in excess of\nthose limits.\nQUESTION:\nthe contribution limits restriction was because of\nthe corruption or appearance of corruption between\nthe contribution and the candidate. I don't think\nBuckley supports the proposition that Congress can\nwilly-nilly regulate any sort of contributions in\nconnection with an election campaign.\nMR. OLSON: Of course not, Mr. Chief\nJustice. What this Court has said over and over\nagain, that Congress can regulate contributions from\ncorporations -- the treasuries of corporations and\nunions. Separate segregated funds still exist so\nthat those contributions from members can be made,\nand that Congress can regulate the amount of those\ncontributions. That's all that Title I of BCRA does.\nAnd that's -- all three of those aspects were\naddressed by this Court in Buckley and have been\naddressed again and again and again.\nQUESTION: You say that is all that it\ndoes. It regulates contributions to parties and the\nargument is that's quite different from a\ncontribution to a candidate, which is one of the\nissues here, it seems to me.\nMR. OLSON: In fact, Buckley did regulate\nthe amount of the contributions by corporations and\nunions and in excess of certain levels to parties as\nwell. There was not only a 1,000 contribution limit\nto the candidate, but there were limitations in\nBuckley with respect to the amount of expenditures\nthat an individual might make in consultation or\ncoordination with a candidate and there were\naggregate limits with respect to the $25,000 limit\nthat was set for the precise reason, this Court\nexplained, to avoid circumvention of the limits in\nconnection with the --\nQUESTION: Contributions to parties were\nlimited that way?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Scalia. The\naggregate contribution by parties and the Court\ntalked in terms of the aggregate contributions that\ncould be made all together by the individual, and the\ncourt specifically talked about that, that $25,000\nlimit was for the very purpose of preventing the\nindividual to circumvent the contribution limit to a\ncandidate by giving money to the party which would\nthen be given to the same candidate, and the court\nspecifically said in Buckley that that would be\nunearmarked money that would go to the party, which\nwould then go to the candidate.\nQUESTION: But what about a contribution\nto the party, we'll call it a payment to the party?\nMR. OLSON: A contribution, Justice\nKennedy. I don't think I understand the question,\nbecause the court specifically talked in terms of the\ncorrupting influence of corporate union and\nuncontrolled large money contributions and what this\nCourt said then and has said over and over again that\nCongress can attempt to avoid circumvention of those\npermissible limits. Now, Mr. Starr spoke a moment\nago about the lavish evidence of abuses that were set\nout and reported in the Thompson report. Among those\nevidence of abuses is that enormous amounts of\nso-called soft money, which is just another way of\nsaying money that is prohibited to go to Federal\nelections, was going to Federal elections through\nvarious surrogates, through the national party.\nQUESTION: Is, is there evidence in the\nrecord of access corruption, so to speak, using soft\nmoney to fund purely state and local elections, as\nopposed to Federal?\nMR. OLSON: The evidence --\nQUESTION: Is there evidence of that?\nMR. OLSON: What the evidence, if I\nunderstand your question correctly, is that the money\nwas going from, through the national parties and at\nthe direction of the national parties to the state\nsubordinate committees in order to fund various\nactivities that had to do with Federal elections, and\nthat's what, they were --\nQUESTION: If I understand, evidence that\nthe money being used to fund purely state and local\nelection activities?\nMR. OLSON: No, that was not what Congress\nwas concerned about. Congress was concerned --\nQUESTION: But the ban extends to that,\napparently?\nMR. OLSON: The -- the ban -- no. In the\nsense that the state parties can raise un -- money\nthat's not regulated, provided that it's not used in\nconjunction with Federal election activity. So in\nthat sense, the states are free to continue to do\nthat and spend all they wish.\nQUESTION: Which is very broadly defined\nFederal election activity.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is, it is broadly\ndefined, but it has been defined by the experts in\nthis country on elections, the corruption of big\nmoney, the regulation and the potential abuses. This\nCourt has previous said over and over again, this is\nan area where there is special expertise in Congress.\nThis legislation --\nQUESTION: Special expertise and also\nspecial interest. Do, do you know any provision of\nthis law that disadvantages incumbents? I can name\nyou several that disadvantage challengers. Is there\nany provision of the law that you think puts\nincumbents at a disadvantage?\nMR. OLSON: Well, let me put it this way.\nThe incumbents were doing very well under the\nexisting system, 98.5 percent of the members of\nCongress, the congressional, the House of\nRepresentatives that ran for re-election in 2002 were\nre-elected.\nQUESTION: But they had to work very hard\nfor it.\nMR. OLSON: Well, apparently not. The\nevidence also shows that's in the record --\nQUESTION: The record is, the legislative\nrecord is full of complaints about how hard it is to\nraise all this money and it's a lot of trouble.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the evidence is that the\ncan -- the candidates --\nQUESTION: Your answer to my question is\nno, I gather?\nMR. OLSON: No. The answer to --\nQUESTION: Can you name any provision? I\ncan name several that disadvantages challengers.\nNumber one, the very existence of restrictions upon\nmoney because if no money can be spent at all, the\nincumbent is going to win. It's well-known that the\nchallenger needs more money. Number two, the\nrestrictions on parties that we were just talking\nabout. It is also well-known that where the national\nparty will generally spend its money in a Federal\nelection is in supporting a challenger in a district\nor in a state where the, where the Representative or\nthe incumbent Representative or Senator is in\ntrouble.\nMR. OLSON: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: I can go on. The millionaire\nprovision, I think, advantages incumbents.\nMR. OLSON: Let me -- let me -- there are\nseveral answers to that. One, this Court's --\nQUESTION: Let me finish my thought. What\nI conclude from this is that perhaps we shouldn't be\nso deferential to Congress in this matter. You know,\nin the area of separation of powers, we do not defer\nto Congress when Congress is in a head-to-head clash\nwith the executive branch on separation of powers\nmatters. Why? Because Congress is self-interested\nin that area.\nis eminently self-interested in making laws that\nrestrict the manner in which people can challenge\ntheir re-election?\nMR. OLSON: There are several answers to\nthat question. First of all, that very issue was\naddressed in 1976 in Buckley and the court said that\nthe rules are applying equally to anybody running for\noffice, and in that circumstance, the court will look\nto evidence of invidious discrimination against\nchallengers. There is no evidence of invidious\ndiscrimination against challengers.\nNumber two, the evidence supports\noverwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get\nre-elected under the old system just fine and that\noverwhelming amount of evidence is not in the record,\nin the testimony below, which is summarized in, in\nvarious different sources that the repeated testimony\nby Senator Thompson, Senator McCain, former Senator\nSimon and over and over again abuses in the system\nthat were not benefiting incumbents but were tearing\ndown faith of the American people in a system of\ngovernment and making people believe that the more\nmoney that you put in, to use the words of one\nindividual, the White House is like a subway. You\nhave to put money in the turnstiles.\nQUESTION: Too much money. Too much\nmoney. That's the problem. Too much money is being\nspent on elections.\nMR. OLSON: Justice Scalia, the evidence\nshows and the Federal Election Commission came out\nwith a report earlier that year that candidates are\nraising more money this year. It's not the amount of\nmoney, but it's the source of money from potential\ncorrupting influences and that the hard money, in\nfact, has benefits to the party and to the\ncandidates. The statistics showed that in, $500\nmillion was raised in the year 2000 for soft,\nso-called soft money. Again, that's a euphemism for\nmoney that's going around the system. That, that was\n42 percent of the amount of money that the national\nparty spent on election activities, up from 9 percent\nin 1984, 42 percent. Of that $500 million, 60\npercent came from just 800 donors. In that year, the\ntop 50 donors each gave between 950,000 and $6\nmillion a piece.\nQUESTION: Is there any, anything in there\nthat says whether the bulk of that money you just\nreferred to by the 950 donors, that more went to\nchallengers than to incumbents? Or that more went to\nincumbents than to challengers?\nMR. OLSON: I don't have a breakdown of\nthat, Justice Breyer, but what the evidence does\nshow, if you go back election by election, every two\nyears, that incumbents under the old system, if a\nmember of the House of Representatives decided to\nstand for re-election, the statistics year after year\nare the same, 97 to 98 to 98.5 percent of the\nincumbents were winning re-election. So to the\nextent that Congress would devise this scheme --\nQUESTION: General Olson --\nQUESTION: Is that the problem you are\nsolving here?\nMR. OLSON: No, no, Justice Scalia. But\nit directly addresses the question that you raised to\nthe extent that Congress was looking for a scheme to\nprotect incumbencies, they were doing very well. It\nwould be hard to develop a scheme that could be\nbetter for incumbents.\nQUESTION: General Olson, I suppose\nanother reason why we should not defer to the\nincumbents is they have an interest in spending their\ntime working for the public rather than raising\nmoney, and this will save a lot of time so that we\nshouldn't defer to them on it, no.\nMR. OLSON:\nStevens, that's a reason for deferring to them. The\nevidence, as Mr. Starr put, was lavish, that the\nabuses were enormous, and that Members of Congress\nwere spending --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. You keep calling\nthem abuses. People were taking advantage of those\ngaps in the law that existed. Is that an abuse,\nevery time -- we do it with the tax code all the\ntime. We don't say oh, it's an abuse. He took\nadvantage of --\nMR. OLSON: It is -- the evidence --\nQUESTION: And there will be abuses under\nthis law, too.\nMR. OLSON: Of course, of course --\nQUESTION: Water will run downhill, and if\nyou cannot make your voices heard in this fashion,\nthey'll find another fashion.\nMR. OLSON: What this Court said in\nBuckley, in Shrink Missouri Government, in every one\nof the cases that this Court has considered is that\nthose are indeed abuses that those are corrupting\ninfluences, and the word abuse was Justice Starr's\npractically, Justice Starr's first word, I mean\nGeneral Starr's first word out of his mouth. That is\neverybody's word when it comes to the system. I\nguess you'll have to wait.\nQUESTION: General Olson --\nMR. OLSON: It was everybody's word when\nthey described this system, when you talk about the\nenormous amount of money that was avoiding the direct\nregulatory scheme and going through various\nsurrogates to accomplish the same thing.\nQUESTION: One feature of this is puzzling\nto me, and that is if the candidate corruption is\nwhat, or the officeholder corruption is the heart of\nit, we don't want candidates, officeholders to be\nbought, then why did Congress, why was Congress more\ngenerous to candidates and officeholders than it was\nto the parties. A concrete example. A candidate for\nFederal office can make a speech at a fundraising\nevent for a state or local candidate, if I read the\nstatute correctly, but an officer of the national\nparty could not.\nMR. OLSON: Acting in his capacity, in the\nwords of the statute, on behalf of the national\ncommittee. Acting as an individual that wouldn't be\nthe case, but when he is speaking in terms of the\nparty, that was the case. The, what Congress was\nattempting to do is --\nQUESTION: I don't understand what that\nmeans.\nMR. OLSON: What an individual --\nQUESTION: What does that mean? Could he\nbe introduced at the event as the chairman of the\nRepublican National Committee?\nMR. OLSON: That's -- I'm speaking now,\nJustice Scalia, in the terms of the statute itself.\nIt talks in terms of his capacity as a member of the\nchairman of the party.\nQUESTION: Yeah, I want to know what that\nmeans.\nMR. OLSON: And an individual might do\nsomething separately, and that's --\nQUESTION: So you couldn't introduce him\nas the chairman of the Republican --\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Could just say Joe Dokes\nendorses the Government and don't mention that this\nis the chairman of the National Republican Committee.\nMR. OLSON: I suppose that would be up to\nsome level of reasonable prosecution, prosecutorial\ndiscretion.\nQUESTION: Well, is this the sort of thing\nwe ordinarily have, I can see in the tax code, but\nordinarily we don't have in a connection with the\nFirst Amendment some very debatable thing that might\nbe this, might be that.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's actually relatively\nclear, Mr. Chief Justice, the regular -- not only are\nthe, is the statute relatively clear and not only\ndoes the statute specifically address the abuses that\nwere well-documented and their evasions.\nQUESTION: I'm talking about the official\nversus individual capacity.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that, that, probably\nthat language wouldn't even had to have been in the\nstatute, Mr. Chief Justice. I would presume that\nwould be presupposed that agents of the national\nparty acting on behalf of the national party can't do\nthe things that the national party can do.\nOrganizations subject to the control of the national\nparty can't do the same things that the national\nparty can do. That indeed is the same sort of\nlegislation that this Court has considered before.\nLet me -- on this subject\nQUESTION: In any case, in his official\ncapacity, he can't do it. The candidate can.\nJustice Ginsburg's question stands. What is the\nanswer to that?\nQUESTION:\nthat the same thing goes for contribution to a 501(c)\nthat the candidate for Federal office can make that\nsolicitation, but not an officer of the party.\nMR. OLSON: There, there are indeed some\nof those areas where there are refinements because\nCongress was concerned with the -- this Court has\nsaid repeatedly that political parties are, have\nspecial advantages. Colorado II talks about that,\nthat there are special rights and special privileges,\nand so Congress was concerned with the immense\npossibility, the immense power of national political\nparties to engage in abuses. So Congress was\nparticularly concerned and with abundant record of\nthe use of money going to the national parties to\ncircumvent these things.\nQUESTION: I thought we were talking about\ncorruption. Surely the possibility of corruption is\nmuch more direct when it's the candidate himself who\nwas soliciting for this organization, which will then\nhelp him. Then it is indirect, where the national\nparty solicits and it may get to him or not. He\ndoesn't know what's going on.\nMR. OLSON: It's entirely possible that\nCongress has not solved every potential abuse of\nFederal election law and that the lawyers will be\nback before this Court with another piece of\nlegislation. Congress did not have before it\nevidence of abuse of that nature, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: But it went out of its way to\nallow incumbents to do this. Went out of its way.\nIt didn't leave a gap. It said we're not going to\nlet the parties do this, but we will let the\ncandidates do it.\nMR. OLSON: It made some, in my judgment,\nperfectly understandable exceptions for individuals\nacting in their own capacity or individuals engaging\nin certain things, as opposed to the massive power of\nthe party.\nQUESTION: If we found that this law had\nthe purpose or the effect of giving significant\nadvantage to incumbents, would we have to strike it\ndown under the First Amendment?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the challenge was the\nEqual Protection Clause was considered in Buckley. I\nsee no evidence of any invidious discrimination. I\nguess we would be concerned.\nQUESTION: Do you think there is a First\nAmendment interest in protecting incumbency?\nMR. OLSON: I think that that would be a\nvery serious concern, Justice Kennedy, but there is\nnot any evidence of invidious discrimination, to use\nthe language of this Court in Buckley.\nQUESTION: But you say in your brief and\nin Mr. Waxman's brief, you indicate that Buckley has\nto be revised because speech has evolved in a way\nthat Buckley didn't anticipate. That seems to me to\nbe an argument for not allowing severe regulations,\nsuch as this statute does, and allows speech to\ndevelop on its own. So that parties, which are very\nimportant entities in the system, have the capacity\nto respond to other unregulated entities such as the\npress. The press is exempt from all of these\nrestrictions and parties are not. That seems to me,\nMr. Olson, a very curious balance in a democratic\nsociety.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the Court has addressed\nthat very concern starting with Buckley up through\nColorado I and II. The fact that the party may be\nused as a conduit for circumvention of the limits on\ncontributions to candidates. And let me add that the\nRepublican National Committee, in their brief below,\nsaid that the Republican Party is a single unitary\norganization. This is at page 23 of the RNC\nopposition brief in the court below.\nThe Republican Party is a single unitary\norganization that comprises various interrelated\nparts. The RNC, state and local parties, the RNC's\n165 members, candidates identifying themselves as\nRepublicans and so forth. And Mr. Burchfield, when\nhe testified on April 5, 2000 before the Committee on\nRules and Administration of the United States Senate,\nsaid, legislative proposals to ban party receipt of\nsoft money also cannot seek to impose restrictions on\nstate parties -- also must seek to impose\nrestrictions on state parties as well. They cannot\nbe effective otherwise.\nThat's exactly what the understanding that\nCongress had when it addressed this statute.\nQUESTION: Step back for a second.\nBecause, say, looking at it more broadly, I think\nwe're hearing many arguments of this form, which is a\nserious argument, it seems to me. When you look at\nthe statute, it becomes highly complex and really\nquite restrictive in the many ways that have been\nmentioned.\nAt the same time, there are no\nrestrictions on the press, and at the same time, you\ncan give as much money as you want to the NRA, to the\nNRDC, to every interest group that supports both the\nRepublicans or the Democrats or whatever. And so all\nthat will happen is that the power and the money will\nshift to those groups, and you will have precisely\nwhat Madison called faction, because the parties act\nas a tempering device. That if $10 million can be\ngiven to private groups to Get Out the Vote, and if\nthe election is about getting out the vote, you've\nshifted the power from the party to the special\ninterest group.\nAnd now the press was one example. We're\nhearing arguments of that form, and so I would like\nto hear a general response to that kind of an\nargument.\nMR. OLSON: The distinction was made by\nthis Court in Buckley and in the subsequent decisions\nthat there is a higher level of scrutiny and a\ngreater level of concern with respect to the amount\nbeing given to an individual and a greater identity\nand potential for abuse, because that money can then\nbe spent either directly by the individual or in\ncoordination with the political party on the\nindividual's reelection, if individuals go out and\naffiliate with this group or that group and spend the\nmoney.\nThat's not subject to the same kind of\nlevel of control by the party or the candidates and\nit is looked at --\nQUESTION: You're equating the party with\nthe individual. And the party is no more the\nindividual candidate than is the National Rifle\nAssociation the candidate who happens to ardently\noppose gun control. And the question that Justice\nBreyer is posing is, why do you pick on the party as\nthis instrument for making public views, even the\npublic views of the wealthy, known and allow\ncontributions to these other groups?\nMR. OLSON: Congress didn't pick on a\nparty, Justice Scalia. Congress focused on the fact\nthat the parties control, as in the words of the\nsegment from the brief that I quoted, the party and\nthe candidates are, in one extent, one and the same.\nSecondly, the parties are given\nconsiderable privileges, the power to put candidates\non the ballot. There is reasons that the exercise of\nthis enormous power can be subject to greater\nrestrictions. Congress wasn't picking on parties.\nCongress was, one, looking at where the greatest\nabuses were. And then number two, following the\nguidelines set by this Court.\nQUESTION: In Colorado I, we said that the\ncorruption rationale did not seem -- seemed quite\nattenuated in connection with the parties.\nMR. OLSON: With respect to independent\nexpenditures, the Court said that. And then the\nCourt addressed the coordinated expenditures and\napproached it in quite a different way, and held that\ncoordinated expenditures in Colorado II could be\ntreated just like contributions.\nAnd the difference is that the Court has\nheld, quite understandably, that the level of concern\nthat Congress might have over abuses from\ncontributions is greater, and the level of First\nAmendment concern is more attenuated because that\ncontribution may be used in a different way,\ndepending upon the contributions.\nQUESTION: There are two steps. Why is a\ncontribution or payment to the NRA any less a\ncontribution than a payment to the Republican Party\nin certain instances with certain candidates? You\nequate -- the statute equates, and so I think you\nmust. You equate parties and candidates.\nMR. OLSON: In the first place --\nQUESTION: This is a remarkable\nproposition.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is the same\nproposition that is discussed in Buckley in\nconnection with the aggregate contribution limit, and\nis discussed several times in the cases that come\nalong since Buckley.\nThe party is a different entity. The NRA\nor any other of the many organizations that might\nspend their money for this in a way that the\ncandidate cannot control would not be focused in the\nsame way. This Court provides the guidance that says\nthat the parties, because they're so closely\nidentified with the individuals, and such a source of\npotential circumvention, are something that the\nCongress may legitimately be concerned with.\nAnd this legislation was developed as a\nresult of six years of intense investigation, debate,\ntestimony, delicate compromises, all conducted in the\ncontext of congressional elections and a presidential\nelection. This was a product of a lot of time by the\npeople who, over and over again, talked about the\nlevel that abuses had come to.\nQUESTION: All done by incumbents,\nincidentally.\nMR. OLSON: Well, we pass laws in the\nUnited States, Justice Scalia, by people who already\nhold office.\nQUESTION:\ndon't pertain to what it takes to get them out of\noffice.\nMR. OLSON: What this Court has repeatedly\nsaid is that congressional judgments -- and I can\nonly quote the language of this Court in Buckley.\nCongress could legitimately conclude, speaking in\nterms of potential for corruption. In the NRWC case\nin 1982, a unanimous Court said that careful\nlegislative adjustment of Federal electoral law in a\ncautious, advanced, step-by-step, warrants\nconsiderable deference. We accept -- this is a\nunanimous Court -- Congress's judgment that it is the\npotential for such influence that demands regulation,\nnor will we second guess a legislative determination\nas to the need for prophylactic measures where\ncorruption is the evil feared.\nIf the Court were to look at the long\nseries of the summary of abuses in Judge\nKollar-Kotelly's decision below, and to look at the\ntestimony given by former Senators Rudman and Simon\nand Boren and the other individuals who describe what\nit's like, the breakfasts, the lunches, the\nreceptions, the dinners, the endless cycle of\ncampaign finance.\nQUESTION: The attack ads. The\nlegislative record is full of hostility toward these\nattack ads.\nMR. OLSON: Justice Scalia, the parties\nand the candidates can spend all of the hard money\nthey want on attack ads or any other types of ads.\nCongress was focusing there, with respect to specific\ntypes of legislation, in connection with the use of\nstate money, soft money that comes to the state\nparties, in conjunction with elections taking place\nat which Federal officials are on the ballot.\nQUESTION: General Olson, you said a\nmoment ago, referred to the testimony of Senators\nRudman and Simon and Boren about you know,\nbreakfasts, lunches. That I don't believe is a\npermissible basis for a restriction, that you know,\nwe're tired of having to go to these breakfasts and\nlunches.\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't\nmean to say that these numbers were saying it was too\nmuch work. What they were saying is that the\nrelentless pursuit of big contributions was\ninnervating to the political process. The record\nQUESTION: That is not a -- that's what\nthe Chief was saying. That is not a valid complaint.\nWe've never said that's a valid justification.\nMR. OLSON: The potential for\nindebtedness, the feeling of indebtedness, the\nselling of access.\nQUESTION: That's why they didn't want to\ngo to breakfasts and lunches.\nQUESTION: I don't understand why that --\nby just saving time for government work is not a\nvalid interest anyway.\nMR. OLSON: Of course it is a --\nQUESTION: Why should they waste all their\ntime raising money.\nMR. OLSON: Of course it is a valid\ninterest, Justice Stevens, but what all of these\nindividuals were talking about was the appearance and\nthe actuality that the system had been corrupted.\nThe access --\nQUESTION: Is there a feeling of\nobligation and access to an organization which\ndelivers a million votes on its own?\nQUESTION: Of course there is, Justice\nKennedy, but the First Amendment considerations as\narticulated by this Court address the infusion of\nmoney from particular sources, either from wealthy\nindividuals or a corporation -- corporate treasuries\nor unions differently.\nAnd what all of this testimony was about\nwasn't how much time it took, was that money had\nbecome the number one operative driving force, not\nonly in the running for office, but for the entire\nperiod that the individual was in office.\nAnd that the political parties -- and the\nevidence was abundant, lavish -- that the political\nparties themselves were saying if you give this\namount of soft money, we will set up meetings with\nthese members of Congress or these leaders of the\nparty or this opportunity to spend a night in the\nWhite House or whatever. The actual access which is\nhow things get done in Congress was something -- was\nnot only for sale, but also perceived to be for sale.\nQUESTION: Of course many people think\nthat what produced that situation was the original\ncampaign finance law, which set individual\ncontribution limits so low that you indeed had to go\naround scurrying for money, because you couldn't\naccept greater amounts from more wealthy donors.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there is two answers to\nthat. The contribution limits have been increased.\nQUESTION: Insignificantly, if that is the\nproblem.\nMR. OLSON: But what this Court has said\nin Buckley, and has also said over and over again is\nto the extent that the candidates and the parties\nhave to reach out to more individuals for more\nparticipation rather than relying on this 800 or so\nindividuals that give large amounts of money. That's\nbetter for the candidates and it's better for the\nparties and it's better for the political process.\nQUESTION: Don't mind having to spend all\nthe time raising the money. I thought you just said\nthat that's bad. Now you say it's good.\nMR. OLSON: What -- what I'm, what I'm\nsaying, Justice Scalia, is what this Court has said,\nthat to the extent that a larger numbers of smaller\ncontributors, that you don't need to spend all this\nmuch time courting is a better process for the\npolitical system. That's what this Court said, and\nthat's what this Court has said over and over again.\nQUESTION: General Olson, could I ask you\nto address the regulation of state parties and the\nregulation of funds spent in state elections. What,\nwhat basis is there for the Federal Government to do\nthat?\nMR. OLSON: The, the legislation refers to\nmoney that is spent in Federal election activity.\nThis Court has repeatedly said starting in the 19th\ncentury that the control, the regulation of Federal\nelections is quintessentially important to what\nCongress does. What Congress had abundant evidence\nthat this money, that, that the individuals, my\nopponents are talking about having to do with state\nelections were when Federal candidates were on the\nballot and money was being used ostensibly for\nneutral purposes, but for the primary purpose of\nbringing out voters to vote in a Federal election and\nto influence the outcome of that election.\nQUESTION: But that isn't what the law\nsays, that when it's ostensibly for the -- if you're\nusing it in the best of good faith to get out the\nvote for a state election, even when the Federal\nelection in this particular state is a forgone\nconclusion. There is -- one party has it so locked\nup that the Federal election is a nullity, and all of\nthe money is being spent on a state election.\nMR. OLSON: What --\nQUESTION: Nonetheless, the Federal\nGovernment says these are the rules under which the\nstate party can spend money.\nMR. OLSON: And the state party can spend\nunlimited amounts of money that's, that's in\nconnection with an election.\nfound that where there is a Federal official on the\nballot, that money spent in that election --\nQUESTION: Not in my hypothetical. In my\nhypothetical, it's not true.\nMR. OLSON: Well, to the extent that under\nsome circumstances, there is -- it's inconceivable to\nestablish --\nQUESTION: This is narrow tailoring?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: This is narrow tailoring?\nMR. OLSON: No. I'm suggesting that where\nthis money has been spent in the past and as defined\nby Congress in Section 323(b), Federal election\nactivity is relatively clearly defined. It's in\nconnection with -- Justice --\nQUESTION: I didn't mean to interrupt you\nin your sentence. But my question to you was going\nto be, do you deny that a, that in a situation that\nJustice Scalia describes, that there may be an\nas-applied challenge whereas the possibility of that\nsituation does not necessarily carry a facial\nchallenge?\nMR. OLSON: That's correct. And this\nCourt has said again and again to the extent that\nthere's an overbreadth challenged in the context of a\nfacial attack on a statute, the statute must be\nsubstantially overbroad. There may be particular\nas-applied challenges to particular aspects of this\nlegislation.\nQUESTION: I think there are a lot of\nsituations like that. There is more than one. I\nthink that's, that's likely to be very common.\nMR. OLSON: But Justice Scalia, what the\n-- what Congress was looking at is that the huge\namounts of money being used at the time of elections\nwhere Federal candidates were on the ballot,\npolitical parties, and whether they be state parties\nor national parties are going, are not going to pour\nenormous amounts of resources into elections at which\nthere is not much of a context, a contest. State\nparties can spend all of the Federal, the hard money\nthey want with respect to those activities and then\nthe Levin amendment, which was not required by the\nConstitution, not necessary, but that gave an\nadditional ability of the state to use under certain\ncircumstances soft money, unregulated by the Federal\nGovernment in those contexts.\nThe bottom, at the bottom, what this\nlegislation does is treat the very same abuses that\nthis Court was concerned about in Buckley v. Valeo,\nand has said repeatedly are the types of concerns\nthat are legitimate for Congress to be concerned\nabout and to use the words of this Court, go to the\nvery fundamental integrity of our government. The\nonly thing in Title I that Congress did was to\ncontrol the source of contributions, unions and\ncorporate treasuries, and the amounts above a certain\namount, and a potential circumventions of those\nlimits. All three of those things this Court has\nrepeatedly said are constitutional, appropriate, and\nnecessary to protect the integrity of the Federal\nelectorate process. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF INTERVENOR-DEFENDANTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issues before the Court in connection\nwith Title I and the rest of this legislation raise\nthe most fundamental challenge for any, for any\nrepresentative democracy. It's a challenge that this\nCourt, beginning at least with Justice Frankfurter\nand the United Auto Workers case and extending\nthrough this Court's opinion in Shrink Missouri and\nBeaumont, has recognized that is the imperative of a\nrepresentative democracy to retain the confidence of\nthe individual citizens with whom we all share the\nfranchise, that their vote counts, that big money\ndoesn't call the tune, and that when Members of\nCongress and the President and Vice President make\ndecisions on our behalf, they do so because they\nthink it is in the best interest of their country and\nour judgment as constituents and their own judgment.\nAnd there was reference paid, reference\nmade to the testimony of members of this, of\nCongress, respected members like Senator Simpson and\nSenator Rudman, and it is very important to focus on\nwhat those Senators said under oath. When Senator\nSimpson testified, he testified that too often,\nmembers' first thought is not what is right, or what\nthey will believe, but how it will affect\nfundraising. Who, after all, can seriously contend\nthat a $100,000 donation does not seriously alter the\nway one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an\nissue?\nQUESTION: Was his testimony that others\nthought that, or that he thought it?\nMR. WAXMAN: He was -- his declaration is,\nhis sworn declaration is in the joint appendix,\nMr. Chief Justice, in the first volume. He was\nspeaking in general and about all of us, and so, too,\nwas Senator Rudman when he testified under oath that\nlarge soft money contributions distort the\nlegislative process because they affect whom Senators\nand House members see, whom they spend their time\nwith, what input they get, and make no mistake about\nit, this money affects outcomes as well, and millions\n--\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, wasn't there\nconsiderable dearth of evidence as to something a\nlittle bit different, which are a quid pro quo?\nMR. WAXMAN: There was, there was a\nconcession in this case that give, that there is no\nspecific evidence that a particular vote was changed\nbecause of a particular donation, but of course,\nthat, too, was not true in Buckley v. Valeo. Buckley\nv. Valeo, this Court made reference to the findings\nof the D.C. Circuit which dealt exclusively with\nexcess access by the milk producers and others and\nambassadorships and the record in this case so\noverwhelms the record before this Court in -- in\nfact, it overwhelms by several orders of magnitude\nthe factual records that existed in Buckley and all\nof its progeny. Now, Justice --\nQUESTION: Talk is cheap. I mean, access\nis not votes. Sure, Members of Congress are going to\ngive time to people who have given money to their\ncampaign. It doesn't mean they are going to vote\nthat way.\nMR. WAXMAN: It certainly doesn't mean\nthey're going to vote that way, but --\nQUESTION: So is this corruption?\nMR. WAXMAN: The testimony --\nQUESTION: Is the giving of more time to\nthem, is that corruption, or the appearance of\ncorruption?\nMR. WAXMAN: The giving -- this Court has\nsaid that corruption in the Buckley sense is the\ninfluence of large donations on the judgment and\nbehavior of officeholders, and Justice Scalia, there\nis a mountain of evidence from experts, members,\nlobbyists, 60 pages of findings from Judge\nKollar-Kotelly and almost as many from Judge Leon\nthat access buys influence, and there are any number\nof ways that cannot be statistically observed to\nchange outcomes besides a particular vote.\nQUESTION: I think that's the bottom line.\nThat's the moment of truth. Do you get any votes for\nthe money that you contribute to the candidate? If\nyou don't get that, you are getting nothing.\nMR. WAXMAN: You can go back and overrule\nBuckley v. Valeo, and every other one of these cases\nyou have decided because that has never been proven.\nIt is very difficult to prove, and what Cong -- what\nCongress needs to aim at, it needs to aim at the\nwillingness of the hundreds of millions of people out\nthere who think that their vote counts and think that\nMembers of Congress will be responsive to them and\nwho are justifiably cynical when they see that in the\nlast presidential election, $500 million that law\ndoes not permit to be used for Federal election\npurposes was used for that purpose as the political\nparty's own expert, Professor La Raja acknowledged\nthat it almost all was used for Federal election\npurposes.\nThis goes right to the question, it goes\nright to Justice O'Connor's question about state\nparties and I think the Chief Justice's question\nabout the national ban, and I'd like to address those\nfirst.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, before you do, do\nyou have an answer to the argument put to General\nOlson by Justice Breyer that if you don't allow the\nparties to play in the soft money league, then the\nmoney will go elsewhere. It will go to the\nindependent, sometimes highly ideological groups. It\nwill go to the NRA, for example. And that would make\nthings even worse than they are now.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. I have, I have several\nquestions and that, that was my, the next point I was\ngoing to address after the first two, which is, it is\nwrong on about 10 different levels, but the bottom\nline is if it turns out to be an abuse, that is, if\nit turns out to be a phenomenon that creates\ncorruption as this Court defined it, either in the\ncase of individual contributions in Buckley or\nthrough corporate and labor union for the principles\nthat were articulated by this Court in National Right\nto Work and Austin and about which we'll be visiting\nthis afternoon, Congress can take care of the\nproblem. The one thing that --\nQUESTION: Muzzle them, muzzle them, too.\nMR. WAXMAN: The one thing --\nQUESTION: That's the solution.\nMR. WAXMAN: The one thing that we know\nfor certain, Justice Scalia, in this uncertain world,\nthere is at least one thing that is certain, and that\nis that the people who enacted BCRA and the people\nwho populate the House and Senate, if they find that\nthe national political parties are being\ndisadvantaged or losing their central role, not only\nin our political system, but in our system of\ngovernance, they will be there to address it.\nGeneral Olson --\nQUESTION: But that's just, that's just a\npolitical calculation? There's no first, there's no\nconstitutional standing for parties to protect their\ncapacity to formulate policy?\nMR. WAXMAN: To be sure, Justice Kennedy,\nand if it were impaired, Congress could and would\naddress it. The data already shows that this year\nthe parties have raised more in hard money alone than\nthey raised in the last presidential election in hard\nand soft money, and they are right on a trajectory to\nraise $1.5 billion in hard money for all of their\nactivities.\nQUESTION: Well, your, your response to\nJustice Kennedy suggests that the parties exist by\nthe leave of Congress. Surely that isn't the case?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it, my argument doesn't\ndepend on if the, the parties, of course, aren't\nmentioned in the Constitution, but they are a\nfundamental aspect of our system of representative\ngovernment, and I, I meant to cast no aspersions on\nthe fact that they play a role not only in electing\ncandidates, but also in organizing in particular the\nlegislative process and the conduct of legislative\nbusiness.\nMy only point is that we can be certain\nthat if something comes to pass that our experience\nso far shows is not going to come to pass, Congress\ncan come to their aid or someone can come to this\nCourt, but the fact --\nQUESTION: But our experience in\nBuckley was not --\nQUESTION: Why do you say that? The\nparties have opposed this legislation. They are on\nthe other side of this case, and you are coming here\nand telling me that the Congress is more concerned\nabout the good of the parties than the parties\nthemselves are. They are on the other side. They\nthink it's hurting them.\nMR. WAXMAN: There is, there is no\nquestion that the, that telling the national\ncommittees of the, the national committees of the\nnational parties that you are now required to accept\nonly funds that are subject to the limitations,\nrestrictions, and reporting requirements of the\nFederal election, Federal law is a limitation and it\nrequires them to accommodate it. I'm only saying\nthat you cannot strike this law down on its face\nbased on a Chicken Little prediction that something\nthat by all accounts is not happening at all does\nhappen.\nAnd the notion that corporate and union\nmoney is just going to flow from, these corporations\nthat gave a million dollars to each party at the same\ntime, is going to flow to the National Rifle\nAssociation or the National Abortion Rights League, I\nthink mistakes the important laudable role that the\nparties play, and mistakes the fact that the\nevidence in this case is that those contributions\nwere strong-armed.\nYou look at the testimony in the record\nand the amicus brief of the business officials, these\npeople were not dying to spend millions of dollars to\nboth political parties, in order to support\ndemocracy. And the notion that they are going to go\nrunning to the National Rifle Association or to\nNARAL, I think has no basis in the record.\nQUESTION: And it's also, I suppose,\nunlikely that they would contribute both to the NRA\nand also to a gun control organization, which they\ndo --\nMR, WAXMAN: I'm not sure that that's\ntrue, but however they choose to use their\nshareholders' resources, I think is up to the\ndemocracy of shareholders.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, these people, these\nindependent groups make independent expenditures. On\nthe party side, once a candidate has been nominated,\nis there practically any such thing as an independent\nexpenditure, as opposed to a coordinated expenditure\nby a party?\nMR. WAXMAN: I have been told that there\nare ways to read this court's opinion in Colorado\nRepublican I and II, to limit that distinction. That\nis, the concept of an independent expenditure to the\none which the Court was presented, which is a\ncircumstance in which the party, in that case the\nColorado Republican Party, didn't have a nominee.\nAnd therefore, it was rather difficult for it to be\ncoordinating. But I believe that --\nQUESTION: There is another distinction,\ntoo. That case, the prohibition on expenditures\nthere applied to both hard and soft money. We're\nonly talking about prohibitions that did not involve\nhard money.\nMR. WAXMAN: That is correct. And this\ndoes go to the point that the Chief raised and\nJustice O'Connor raised about 323(a) and 323(b) that\nI hope I will be able to address. On the state\nparties, you've heard the quote from Mr. Burchfield.\nHe was simply stating the obvious which is, we are\ntalking here, as the act defines it, about national\nparties that organize themselves in national\ncommittees, state committees and local committees.\nAnd all of those parties, all of those\ncommittees act together to elect their slate of\ncandidates. And it is my friends on the other side\nof this case and not us that demean the role of the\nstate and local committees by essentially attaching\ntheir activities to races for dogcatcher and state\nassemblymen, when in fact, they play the central role\nin our system in identifying, grooming and supporting\ncandidates for Federal office.\nThe candidate on the Ohio ballot for\nRepublican for Senate is nominated and placed there\nby the Ohio Republican Party. And you asked about\nthe Tamraz or Riatti contributions and what evidence\nthere was about it. The evidence is that if 323(b)\nwere not in place, that is, there were just a\nnational -- the national committees are out of the\nsoft money business, most of the poster children in\nthe Thompson committee report, Mr. Riatti in '92,\nMr. Tamraz, Carl Lindner, the Hudson Indian gaming\ncasinos. All of the greatest hits that Senator\nThompson came up with.\nThose were people that gave money to the\nstate and local parties in exchange for benefits that\nthey perceived from Federal officeholders.\nQUESTION: You said a moment ago,\nMr. Waxman, that the Ohio Republican candidate was\nplaced there by the Republican state committee. Well,\nwhat if a state has a primary? I mean, if a state\nhas a primary, it's the result of the primary\nelection that places them on the ballot, not the\nstate nomination.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, to be sure. And my\npoint, Mr. Chief Justice, is that to understand why\nMr. Burchfield was correct in saying that this\nproblem, this massive loophole had to address the\nstate and local committees, you need to -- it simply\nreflects the reality that those committees, at least\nbefore they became under the big soft money regime,\nwhat one expert called offshore banks of the national\ncommittees, they play a very important role in\nselecting who are going to be the Federal candidates.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman --\nQUESTION: A very minor detail while\nyou're on it. What is technically the reason why a\nnational committee can't give hard money to a local\ndistrict using Levin funds? And the second thing is,\nwhy is it not possible to have a segregated account\nfor a national party in which a person would put in\nmoney that was only going to be used to give to the\nstate for elections where there was no Federal\ncandidate on the ballot? Those are two detailed\nmatters I just want to get your response to.\nMR. WAXMAN: As to the former, we don't\nthink that the contribution, the soft money\ncontribution ban is subject to strict scrutiny, and\ntherefore, the fact that there may be some other way\nto sort of carve out money that's given to the\nnational committee purely for state elections is a\nconstitutional deficiency.\nBut the argument -- the complicated point\nthat Mr. Burchfield was making about how the Levin\nAmendment works was simply mistaken. It was mistaken\nin several respects.\nFirst of all, there is no prohibition --\nfirst of all, the Levin Amendment is an option. If\neach state and local committee doesn't want to have\nit, they don't have to use it.\nit, nothing prevents them from spending it together.\nThey just can't transfer money, this soft Levin\nmoney, from one committee to another to essentially\nrecreate the problem that existed before, which is\nphenomenal amounts of soft money all being\ntransferred to a few battleground elections.\nThis is important. A national committee\nofficial may -- and the FEC has confirmed this\nrepeatedly -- may in his official capacity, under the\nstationery of the national committee, solicit funds\nup to the hard money limits for any state and local\ncandidate or any state and local committee.\nThat is, it is simply false that a member\nof the Republican National Committee cannot raise $25\nto support Haley Barbour's candidacy. They can. And\nthey can do it in their official capacity up to the\nhard money limits into an account that Haley Barbour\n-- a Federal account that Haley Barbour has set up\nand would need to set up in any event under 323(f)\nand 323(b).\nQUESTION: Even if the state committee has\nchosen the option?\nMR. WAXMAN: This is -- yes. This is hard\nmoney. And in fact, the national committees, even\nfor a local committee that's chosen to use the Levin\nsoft money, the law permits the national committees\nto send hard money to that local committee, provided\nit is not the money that creates the specific match\nfor the allocation.\nAnd the notion that -- a wedge is driven\nin the midst that sort of creates a rift in this\nintegrated national organization is simply wrong.\nQUESTION: It's a pretty big loophole, I\nguess, isn't it? I mean, they write and say, Joe\nRich, give your 6 million to the following 500\ncommittees. They write 50 checks of $10,000 each.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, the homegrown -- the\nso-called homegrown requirement -- I realize the\nLevin Amendment provisions are technical. There is a\nreason that you are not allowed to do that, and that\ngoes again to the point --\nQUESTION: That's not homegrown, my\nexample.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's not homegrown. And it\ngoes to the point about why there couldn't be or\nperhaps why didn't Congress just say let's create a\nseparate account for the national committees, which\nis that the people who gave these huge contributions,\nthe corporations and unions, did not care where it\nwent. They cared what it bought them.\nAnd the notion that if a member of the\nnational -- if Terry McAuliffe comes to somebody and\nsays, we really need $6 million, it's just going to\nbe used for state and local elections, but we really\nneed it, that just recreates the problem that\nCongress was trying to address.\nNow, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that in\nthe course of that rambling discourse, I answered\nyour question about the national ban. But if I\ndidn't, I would love to address myself to it.\nYou asked, Justice Scalia, at the outset,\nis every problem soluble. And the answer -- I hope\nthat was a rhetorical question. In any event, this\nproblem --\nQUESTION: It is for me. I'm not sure it\nwas for you.\nMR. WAXMAN: I believe it is, but out of\nrespect for the Court and in an effort to be\nresponsive, I won't treat it as such. No problem is\nsolvable and as this Court's jurisprudence shows in\nthis area, no solution is permanently solvable.\nWe have a dialectic going on here between\npeople who want to use money to influence people in\ngovernment, and the institutions that need to\npreserve a sense of integrity and faith in the\nprocess. And what my colleagues on the other side\nare urging here -- there has been a lot of debate\nabout the sort of capillaries of the system, but very\nlittle talk about the core of it.\nWhat they are urging is that this law be\nstruck down on its face. And that is a counsel of\ndespair, and that is an approach that this Court and\nthis Congress and this people cannot countenance.\nThank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Starr, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY KENNETH W. STARR\nON BEHALF OF THE MCCONNELL PLAINTIFFS\nMR. STARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nVery briefly. Point 1. There has been a tendency in\nmuch of the argument to equate candidates with a\npolitical party. That is quite incompatible with\nthis Court's cases, Colorado I, Colorado II. It also\nis inconsistent, I think, in a very fundamental level\nwith Citizens Against Rent Control.\nParties are very keenly interested -- I\ncite California -- in ballot initiatives and the\nlike. Parties exist for a number of reasons. This\nCourt said as much in the principal opinion in\nColorado I.\nbringing people together to articulate a world view.\nA vision of what, in fact, is good for society. And\npolitical parties are now finding themselves -- and\nwe point to the record in California -- at\nsignificant disadvantages because of the here and now\neffect of this law.\nThere is less revenue flowing which, in\nthe California Democratic Party has spoken for\nitself. You have that in the record. The California\nDemocratic Party has told the Court, respectfully but\nfirmly, that they depend upon, in that huge state,\nlarge individual contributions. And the people of\nCalifornia -- this is not just one party speaking --\nthe people of California spoke through the\nproposition embraced in the year 2000, saying\npolitical parties are insulators and buffers. They\nare guards against corruption. That is a very\npivotal point in terms of the shift -- I thank the\nCourt.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Starr. We'll\nstand at recess until 1:30.\n(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., oral argument\nin the above-entitled matter was recessed, to\nreconvene at 1:30 p.m., this same day.)\nAFTERNOON SESSION\n(1:30 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Burchfield,\nwe'll hear your rebuttal.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BOBBY R. BURCHFIELD\nON BEHALF OF THE POLITICAL PARTY PLAINTIFFS\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nTime permitting, I'd like to make three\nbrief points. The first is Section 323(a), the\nacross-the-board criminal prohibition on national\nparties can be well contrasted with Section 323(e),\nwhich addresses Federal officeholder solicitation.\nIn 323(e)(1)(B), there is a specific allowance for\nFederal officeholders to raise non-Federal money up\nto the analogous Federal limit for state and local\ncandidates. There is no similar allowance for\nnational party officials, and the conclusion that all\nof my clients have reached is that national party\nofficials are unable to raise non-Federal money, even\nup to the analogous Federal limit if it goes into a\nstate party, a state candidate's campaign account\nbecause that account is not regulated by Federal law.\nNumber two, and to go to Justice\nO'Connor's question, the potential effect of\ncorruption, the potential corruptive effect of such\ndonations is minuscule, nonexistent, attenuated at\nbest, in the words of Colorado I. The $15.6 million,\nby the way, that the RNC spent in state and local\nelection activity in 2001 was 30 percent of the\nnon-Federal money the party raised that year, 30\npercent. It's not an insubstantial amount in any, to\nany degree.\nSecond point, with regard to Section\n323(b), which is the restrictions on state parties,\nthe corruptive potential of donations to state and\nlocal parties for use in Get Out the Vote activities\ndirected to state and local candidate elections is\nagain minuscule, at best attenuated, in the words of\nColorado I. But that activity, if it says go to the\npolls on November 8th, is swept within the definition\nof Federal election activity. The California parties\nsend out hundreds of different mailings every year\nthroughout their states urging voters to go to the\npolls and those mailings mention only state and local\ncandidates. That activity is swept within the\ndefinition of Federal election activity and is now\nfederally regulated activity and that, in that\nrespect 323(b) goes well beyond a congressional\ninterest in eliminating corruption of Federal\ncandidates and officeholders.\nFinal point, and that is with regard to\nSection 213. The only illusion to that was with\nregard to the coordination of activities among the\nnational parties and, and the candidates. 213\naddresses two different uses of Federal money, hard\nmoney. It puts the parties to a single unified\nirrevocable choice to make coordinated expenditures\nunder the statute, Section 441a(d) or their\nconstitutional right to make independent expenditures\nrecognized by this Court in Colorado I. The\nGovernment, and this is very important, the\nGovernment has never advanced any anti-corruption\nrationale to put the parties to that choice. The\nonly rationale we've gotten is Congress can condition\nthe statutory right simply because it's Congress.\nThere is no suggestion that using hard\nmoney for one is more corrupting or is corrupting in\nany way than using hard money for the other. If\nthere are no questions by the Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Burchfield.\nMR. BURCHFIELD: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Abrams, we'll hear from\nyou.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS\nON BEHALF OF MCCONNELL PLAINTIFFS\nMR. ABRAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs we turn from Title I to Title II, we\nturn to efforts by Congress to limit, to regulate,\nand ultimately to punish what are only expenditures,\nexpenditures not made in coordination with parties or\ncandidates which would result in them being treated\nas contributions, but independently, and so we deal\nhere this afternoon in an area which as this Court\nobserved in Colorado II, it has routinely struck down\nexpend -- any limitations in this area. We are all\nagreed here that strict scrutiny applies. There is\nno dispute about that, and I think we're all agreed\nthat this is a content-based restriction on speech,\nwhether we're agreed or not, it is a content-based\nrestriction on speech.\nI'd like to start with just a few\nobservations of --\nQUESTION: Do you take the position that\nno effective regulation of electioneering\ncommunications is permissible?\nMR. ABRAMS: I take the position that\nelectionary communications as defined in the statute\nis so overbroad that the totality of what is\nencompassed in it is not regulatable.\ncommunications includes within it express advocacy,\nwhat is now or what had been subject to regulation,\nand to that extent, it is subject to regulation.\nQUESTION: Beyond express advocacy, do you\nconcede that anything can be regulated?\nMR. ABRAMS: I thought very hard about\nthat, Justice Souter, to see if there was something I\ncould give you in that respect. No, I do not concede\nthat there is anything beyond express advocacy.\nQUESTION: Do you also recognize that\nexpress advocacy is the easiest thing in the world to\navoid? You just say everything about how great your\ncandidate is or how terrible the opponent is, except,\nand go to the polls and vote for X.\nMR. ABRAMS: I understand that that\nhappens. I understand what this Court in Buckley\nunderstood just as well, when it said almost the same\nthing. The Buckley Court did not say that express\nadvocacy was going to catch most, not to say all --\nQUESTION: But, but Buckley was dealing\nwith two words, relative to. It was not confronted\nwith this problem as all.\nMR. ABRAMS: But Buckley Court was\nprescient in understanding that what has happened was\ngoing to happen.\nexpress advocacy covers would not be enough to cover\nthe range of conceptions, people, and organizations\nand unions and corporations and others could come up\nwith.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand --\nMR. ABRAMS: And when they balanced the\nFirst Amendment interest against that --\nQUESTION: I understand why you would want\nto keep what one of the briefs calls this impregnable\nline because then you are within Buckley, but it\nseems to me that this distinction is just\nmeaningless, that the findings below, in Judge\nKollar-Kotelly's opinion make it clear that this is\njust, this is just a silly distinction in many cases.\nWhy don't we just junk it and begin with there, begin\nanew, and begin anew?\nMR. ABRAMS: It seems to me that, that\nthere are only two choices, that I would urge on you\nat least, are constitutional choices. One is to\nadhere to Buckley and to do so, understanding that,\nor accepting, excuse me, that express advocacy is as\nfar as the First Amendment will allow you to go in\nterms of allowing regulation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Abrams --\nMR. ABRAMS:\nsense in the sense that you are using the word, Your\nHonor, sense by scrapping it and in a sense starting\nover. You don't have to scrap it in order to strike\ndown this statute.\nQUESTION: But shouldn't you at least be\n--\nMR. ABRAMS: Because of its overbreadth.\nQUESTION: -- able to answer, answer the\nquestion, why should a speech urging expressly to\nelect a particular candidate to the President of the\nUnited States, why should that speech be entitled to\nless constitutional protection than a speech urging\nthe ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty, for\nexample?\nMR. ABRAMS: The only reason and the only\njustification is that that speech becomes, as it\nwere, so much like a contribution, so much like a\nfinal act of saying, vote for the candidate, not for\nthis reason, not by inference, not by suggestion, but\nthat by finally giving an unambiguous statement --\nQUESTION: But you'd therefore get less\nconstitutional protection. That's what you're\nsaying, I think.\nMR. ABRAMS: It was afforded that little\nsliver, and it was intended to be a sliver, as I read\nBuckley and MCFL was afforded less constitutional\nprotection.\nQUESTION: But it's second-class speech\nunder your submission.\nMR. ABRAMS: With respect -- that was your\nsubmission. I mean, that, that --\nQUESTION: You're saying the only reason\nis that Buckley said so, and so we'll stick to it.\nMR. ABRAMS: No, I'm not saying it's the\nonly reason. I am saying that a flat statement\nsaying vote for somebody can be distinguished not\nonly from how to vote on the Panama Canal.\nQUESTION: I agree it can be distinguished\n--\nMR. ABRAMS: But --\nQUESTION: -- but the question is, why\nshould it get less constitutional protection than the\nother speech? That's what I don't understand.\nQUESTION: Maybe it's more likely to\ninduce gratitude and hence more likely to lead to\nthe, quote, appearance of corruption.\nMR. ABRAMS: I think the very unambiguous\nnature of it might, as Justice Scalia suggests, might\nbe more like -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nrecord bears that out. The findings --\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- of all of the district\njudges, I think, were quite compelling on this point\nthat the really astute, sophisticated candidate\ndoesn't say vote for me either. He uses or she uses\nsome other means. I mean, the speech law has evolved\nsince Buckley, which is perhaps one reason this Court\nshouldn't try to control its evolution.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, speech law has, if\nanything, become more protective since Buckley in the\nFirst Amendment area. And if, if you were to move in\neither direction, I would certainly urge you to move\nin the direction of affording more protection to the\ndirect advocacy that Justice Stevens asked me about,\nrather than less protection for the ad that I\nprovided you with, Congressman Myrick, this is from\nthe AF of L, Congressman Myrick vote against most\nfavors nation's treatment for communist China.\nNow, that is swept in as part of\nelectionary communication. And I would certainly\nurge you if you have any inclination to move in the\ndirection of moving away from Buckley, and there's no\ndoubt that, that there are parts of Buckley\nin tension with each other, that if you were you to\ndo that that you ought not to allow to be swept in\nthe unprotected area advertisements like that.\nQUESTION: But it's not that they can't\nrun the ad. I mean, the unions can run the ad. The\ncorporations can run the ad. The ACLU can run the\nad. They all can run the ad. It's just that they\nhave to pay for it out of a PAC.\nMR. ABRAMS: And that's an --\nQUESTION: So why is that such, what is,\nparticularly, and I wanted to you to get to this, if\nthe disclosure regulations, the new ones, the new\nprovisions in the law on independent expenditure --\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- are constitutional, if they\nare constitutional, then it's pretty hard for me to\nsee any additional burden on any of these\norganizations to make this expenditure on the ad you\nare worried about through a PAC. What's the problem\nof saying, go through the PAC, and what we achieve by\nthat is limiting the amount of money that any one\nindividual can give, and what we lose by it is\nnothing.\nMR. ABRAMS: You mean --\nQUESTION: Now, what's your, what's your\nresponse to that?\nMR. ABRAMS: My first response is that you\nlose a lot of speech.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. ABRAMS: Why? Because there much less\nmoney we will be obtained. That was the idea of it\nwas to take money out of politics, if you will. PACs\ndon't raise as much money as the AF of L have. The\nAF of L spent more, the record reveals on its\nadvertisements, than it raised with the entirety of\nits PAC. Its PAC raised $1.1 million --\nQUESTION: And so what your point is --\nMR. ABRAMS: -- and spent $16 million.\nQUESTION: -- that although it's all right\ngo to Joe Moneybags and say Joe Moneybags, you can\nonly give $100,000 every two years to the Democratic\nParty, it's not all right to go to Joe Moneybags and\nsay Joe Moneybags, you can only give $100,000 a year\nto the AFL-CIO or the pharmacies or somebody for the\npurpose of running a similar ad.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well --\nQUESTION: In other words, you can limit\nJoe Moneybags when he gives the money to a political\nparty, whose whole objective is speech and politics,\nbut you can't limit Joe Moneybags when he gives the\nmoney for the same type of activity to another\norganization.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, my side of the table,\nYour Honor, has not exactly advocated limiting Joe\nMoneybags and giving money to the Democratic Party.\nThat's what they're saying. What I'm saying to you\nis that as regards an organization, either the, we\ncall the ACLU, the AF of L, whichever one you want to\npick, there are burdens that this Court has\nrecognized, serious burdens with having a PAC. There\nis also in this case a level, a level of falsity that\nthe entity would have to engage in with respect to\nwhat it was doing, because it is not true that this\nis all about politics.\nWe have put before you advertisements\nwhich are not simply political advertisements, and\nyet to solicit someone for a PAC you must notify the\nperson of the political purposes of the PAC. You\nmust spend the money only for political purposes.\nThese are requirements in Section 441b with respect\nto a PAC. It is not so that the ACLU when, if it\nwants to run an ad in the last 60 days of the 2004\ncampaign criticizing President Bush for his position\non civil liberties, an ad that would be criminal\nunder this statute if it came from its treasury\nfunds, it is not true that that is a political ad.\nNow, our friends here say, well, it might have\neffect, and that's something I want to talk about.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't the ACLU simply\ncall its PAC the non-partisan issue-oriented PAC? If\n-- if the ACLU is worried about --\nMR. ABRAMS: I'm not talking about the\nname. Justice Ginsburg, it's not the name --\nQUESTION: Misportraying what it's doing\n--\nMR. ABRAMS: -- of the PAC that I'm\nworried about. I'm talking about the institution of\na PAC itself, a PAC pursuant to 441b(6)(3)(b) must\nnotify anyone solicited of its political purposes.\nWhat I'm arguing to you is that --\nQUESTION: And he couldn't say, our\npolitical purpose is to be non-partisan, we are\ninterested in the issue, not the candidate?\nMR. ABRAMS: No, I don't think it is\ntelling someone of political purposes if you say, we\nare not, we don't have political purposes.\nQUESTION: You mean the FEC would say,\nACLU, sorry, you can't do that, you have to otherwise\nidentify your PAC?\nMR. ABRAMS: I don't know what they would\ndo under this criminal statute. I do not think that\nthe ACLU ought to have to run the risk of the FEC\npassing judgment.\nQUESTION: Would they get an advisory\nopinion from the FEC and then they would avoid the\nrisk?\nMR. ABRAMS: Two answers. First, that is\nnot usually the most satisfactory First Amendment\nanswer. If they want to run an ad in the middle of\nthe campaign, to have to go to the government to get\npermission to run the ad --\nQUESTION: Not in the middle of the\ncampaign. They could do it any time.\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: If they want to clarify what\nthey have to say about their PAC, to make it clear\nthat they are not advocating the election of a\nparticular candidate, but that their concern is\nat issue --\nMR. ABRAMS: They can go -- they can seek\nsuch a response from the Commission. I don't think\nmy friends here would argue with me that that's not\nsuch an easy effort. It takes at least weeks and\nweeks to get a response. There are new organizations\nbeing formed all the time that would have to get that\nresponse.\nQUESTION: But your basic point is that\nthey're not going to be able to raise as much money\nas the organization itself has at its disposal\nanyway, whatever you call the PAC.\nMR. ABRAMS: The NRA -- let me give you an\nexample. The NRA raised an enormous amount of money\nin the last campaign. They were mentioned a lot on\nthe floor of Congress with great unhappiness by a lot\nof people. They appealed to 80 million gun owners in\nAmerica. They have 4 million members. Under the\nstandard rules that apply with respect to a PAC, they\ncould only get money from the 4 million people, not\nfrom the 80 million. They could not raise -- they\nraised $300 million.\nQUESTION: Basically that -- I didn't\nmean to interrupt you. Go ahead.\nMR. ABRAMS: Sorry. I'm finishing it.\nThey raised $300 million from their ads on television\nand spent it on more ads to get out their views. And\nnumber one, I think that's part of living in a\ndemocratic society. Number two, to say that they are\nto go down from the sort of level they were at, in\nterms of the people they may appeal to, which is the\nway PACs work and quite properly the way PACs work.\nBut that they must, as a matter of law,\nabandon their general efforts to raise money from the\npublic, is a very significant burden on speech --\nQUESTION: I'm not quite clear on that.\nWhy is that -- I thought all they had to do was, if\nthey want to raise money for these kinds of ads, 60\ndays before the election, mentioning the candidate's\nname, is in their advertising, they say, please send\nyour check to the NRA Election Time PAC. Do they\nhave to do more than that?\nI thought they had to open a bank account,\nthey have to appoint somebody a treasurer, they have\nto make disclosure. And it's a slight difference\nthere between over $250 rather than over $10,000.\nAnd that's it.\nMR. ABRAMS: And they're only allowed to\nsolicit from their membership.\nQUESTION: In other words, you can't go\nand ask -- if I start a PAC or anybody here starts a\nPAC, you can't go and just ask the general public to\nbelong?\nMR. ABRAMS: No, the general public --\nQUESTION: That's NRWC --\nMR. ABRAMS: NRWC says --\nQUESTION:\nPAC?\nQUESTION: Can you ask them to join the\nPAC?\nMR. ABRAMS: No. The general public may\nnot belong to the PAC.\nQUESTION: But can the NRA go out and say,\nlook, we want you to join the NRA, X dollars. We\nalso want you to give the PAC some money, Y dollars.\nCan they do that?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, they can get people to\njoin the NR --\nQUESTION: If they can do that, then your\nargument boils down to the fact that when people are\ntold that they have to join, and the money is going\nto be used for this purpose, they're going to be less\ninterested in doing it. And I don't know why that\nentitles you to a preferable advertising break, in\neffect, in the name of the First Amendment.\nMR. ABRAMS: Look at the burden on speech\nthat we are talking about imposing on an organization\nlike this. Instead of making general appeals to the\npublic, instead of having their say, their argument\nin saying, send us money, et cetera --\nQUESTION: Yeah, but your general appeals\nto the public, it seems to me, are to join the NRA.\nAnd therefore, the universe of people who are\nfinancing the advertisement is limited to members of\nthe NRA.\nMR. ABRAMS: It is limited to members of\nthe NRA.\nQUESTION: So it's the same limitation as\non the PAC.\nMR. ABRAMS: No, sir, the general appeal\nto the public is not limited to the NRA.\nQUESTION: But the appeal to the public is\nnot just to make this ad. It's to join the NRA and\nget all the benefits of membership, which include a\nmagazine and all sorts of other things.\nMR. ABRAMS: But people were free, until\nthis statute, to send contributions to the NRA. They\nwere free to send money, not just to join.\nQUESTION: So what the interest at stake\nhere is the nonmembers of the NRA who want to support\nthe policies of the NRA?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, the difference is\nbetween the 80 million people who have guns and the 4\nmillion who are now members.\nQUESTION: I assume that there is a\nmembership fee that goes along with joining most\norganizations.\nthe campaign, you would have to contribute 50, in\neffect, to join the NRA, plus the 25.\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nQUESTION: So my impression is -- this is\na question of the record, really. And I see you have\nthe point. I mean, there could be burdens of the\nkind you're recommending. And it also could be\noverly broad because they're the genuine issue ads.\nSo I put this on the one side.\nAnd then I put on the other side that if\nwe strike it down -- well, I mean, I wouldn't say\nforget the whole statute, but it seems pretty close\nbecause you get several hundred million dollars to\nrun exactly the same ads that are being run right now\nwhich were about $500 million worth of these ads\nsaying -- they don't say vote against Smith. They\nsay, tell Smith what a rat he is. That's what\nthey -- and it will just be a loophole about 50 miles\nwide.\nAnd all this money, instead of going to\nthe Democratic National Committee or the state\ncommittee or something, go right to the NRA, right to\nthe environmental groups, right to the Right to Life\ngroups, right to the groups the opposite -- in other\nwords, everyone who has a cause will get the money\nand run the same ads that really this was designed\nto --\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, everyone who has a\ncause may get more money, yes. Will they run the\nsame ads as the political parties would have run?\nNo. Will they run the same ads as the candidates\nwould have run? I don't think you can assume that\neither.\nI mean, the only thing in your record,\nincidentally, here, about a breakdown in this area,\nand I think this may be of interest to you, is that\nin the 2000 presidential campaign, of all the ads on\ntelevision, 51 percent were by candidates, 41 percent\nwere by parties and 8 percent by organizations of the\nsort that we are talking about here now.\nQUESTION: Would you clarify something in\nthe record for me? Because I was under the\nimpression with regard to the NRA, that there\nbasically were two pots of money, the PAC money and\nits own money, and its own treasury, if it had wanted\nto spend its own money.\nYou're telling me the real vice in this is\nthat there is a third category, namely money\nsolicited from gun owners who are nonmembers, but\ncould not belong to the PAC.\nthat third --\nMR. ABRAMS: No, I'm not. I'm saying that\nwhat you call their own money includes money obtained\nby solicitations.\nQUESTION: But that's to join the NRA.\nThere is not a separate fund --\nMR. ABRAMS: It's to join --\nQUESTION: Contributed to by gun owners.\nMR. ABRAMS: It's not a separate fund.\nNo, I'm not suggesting it's a separate fund. I'm\nsaying that the totality of the amount received by\nthe NRA includes membership fees and other amounts\ncontributed by people.\nQUESTION: But it includes responses to a\nrequest like this. You don't have to join the NRA to\ngive us money to run these ads. Please give us money\nto run these ads. That's what goes into their\ntreasury now and you're saying they can't get that.\nIs that it? Is that the way it works?\nMR. ABRAMS: I'm not telling you that the\nsolicitations are made in those words. I'm telling\nyou that is what happens.\nQUESTION: That's the functional result?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nimplication of Justice Breyer's suggestion that in\norder to save section 1, we have to abridge First\nAmendment rights under section 2? I suppose it could\nwork the other way around. Section 2 must be\nstricken because there is a First Amendment\nviolation, and Title I becomes meaningless.\nMR. ABRAMS: We thought of putting section\n2 first in the brief. I don't think that you can\njustify, Justice Breyer, striking down or even\nviewing more harshly, that is to say, our arguments.\nThat is to say, you ought not to reject our arguments\nabout Title 2, whatever you do about Title 1.\nQUESTION: What is directly worrying me is\nI think that Title II will make you go through PACs\nto run certain ads. A handful maybe, maybe a little\nbit more than a handful, that are genuine issue ads.\nAnd to the extent that you have to go\nthrough the PAC, that is an added burden and I've\nbeen trying to pin that down that you've been very\nhelpful on. At the same time, there may not be too\nmany. And it may open a tremendous loophole in\nwhat's been traditional, the corporations and labor\nunions do not and cannot contribute to getting people\nelected, at least not through spending money and\ncontributions at -- you know what I'm referring to.\nAnd also, it might open a major loophole\nwhere Joe Moneybags makes the contribution to the\nlabor union or to the corporation that he previously\nis now forbidden to give to the party itself. Those\nare the two things and you've got the first half\naddressed, and I would like to hear the second two.\nMR. ABRAMS: I would like to start by\nsaying that you mentioned the question of the amount\nof ads in question. I'm not going to get involved in\nthe internecine warfare we've had about quite what\nthe number is. But I do want to indicate that we\nhave one judge, Judge Henderson, who has indicated\nthat it is at least 34 percent of all the ads are by\nany standard, quote, genuine, unquote, and perhaps as\nhigh as 64 percent.\nYou have other judges and entities on\ntheir side of the line that have used figures like 14\npercent and the like. Now, all this of course is\ninconsistent with the notion of what express advocacy\nis. But taking even their definitions, as it was,\nwe're talking about a statute which by any standard\never used by this Court would be deemed to be\noverbroad.\nYou can't - I mean to say -- you used the\n14 percent number. 14 percent of these ads -- and I\nthink there are many more. 14 percent are ads which\nin the ordinary course would be considered, quote,\ngenuine, unquote,however we define that. And yet\nsustain a statute which would -- and I use the word\ndeliberately -- criminalize them.\nQUESTION: Is it plain from the record\nthat when a -- and I just don't remember this, but I\nremember the terms. But I don't remember the answer\nto this question. Is it plain that in these\ndiscussions, the term genuine issue ad meant an ad\nthat dealt with issues to the exclusion of any\nreasonable interpretation that it also dealt with\nadvocacy for candidates?\nBecause most of these ads, I think\neverybody would agree, are hybrids. Sure, they\nreally do address issues, and there is also a very\nclear implication about what they want you to do in\nthe ballot booth. So does genuine exclude the\npossibility of a ballot booth implication?\nMR. ABRAMS: Let me say the word genuine\ncomes from the study conducted by the Brennan Center,\nin which they asked students from a particular\nuniversity to opine as to the intent, the state of\nmind --\nQUESTION:\nuniversity?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ABRAMS: The state of the mind of the\npeople that did the ads.\nQUESTION: And it was out of context, too.\nMR. ABRAMS: That's all it was.\nQUESTION: You just saw the ad.\nMR. ABRAMS: Do you think -- you've\nwatched these ads, you've looked at these ads. Sorry,\nthey don't even look at the ads. You've looked at these\npictures like the ones that are at the back of my\nbrief and at the back of the intervenor's brief.\nYou've looked at these pictures.\nTell us, now, is this a genuine ad -- an\nad genuinely directed at an issue or is its purpose\nelectoral? They did not. To answer you directly\nnow -- did not permit for a moment an answer of both.\nQUESTION: Yeah, it was a false dichotomy.\nMR. ABRAMS: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And because it was a false\ndichotomy, I don't know what to make of 7 percent or\n14 percent.\nMR. ABRAMS: What I think you can make is\nthis, is that if given no opportunity at all to say\nboth, they said that the purpose, in their mind, was\nnot electoral, but issue oriented. I think you ought to\ngive us at least that. I mean the both -- the both answer\n--\nQUESTION: This was the defendant's\nevidence, wasn't it?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, sir, yes. It was the\nDefendant's evidence.\nQUESTION: I must confess that I don't, I\ndon't really understand, it's more, what is the\npurpose of an issue ad unless it is to persuade the\nvoter to take some action that will enable that issue\nto carry the day, and the only action a voter can\ntake is to vote for one person or another person. I\nmean, isn't every issue ad an appeal to voters?\nMR. ABRAMS: No.\nQUESTION: I mean, what -- what other\npurpose does it have? Is it asking them to leave\nmoney in their will, or what?\nMR. ABRAMS: The very first issue ad that\nwe have at the back of our brief is one by a term\nlimits organization.\nQUESTION: Like the Belotti situation, the\nBelotti case.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, yes, and it brings that\nto mind.\nsaying, we have our pledge, our term limits pledge.\nThere are two candidates. One has not signed it.\nThe other one has.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. ABRAMS: Call him and tell him to sign\nit. Call David Wu, urge him to sign it. Now, I --\nQUESTION: So it's designed to have an\neffect upon the election, isn't it?\nMR. ABRAMS: I think that one is probably\nnot. I think that one is a, is a group that cares\nless about elections than about their cause, their\ncause is term limits.\nQUESTION: Boy, but you could have, you\ncould have fooled me. They want the term limit\nbecause they want, they want somebody to vote for\nsomeone other than Wu. I mean, how else can you read\nthat? I mean, I can understand a Belotti situation\nin which you've got a, in effect a referendum going\non in which the voters are going to have a direct\nchoice, a ballot initiative kind of thing, but once\nyou get into a situation in which the so-called issue\nad is in the context of an election, I would suppose\nyou would have a tough road to hoe to prove a pure\nnon-electoral purpose.\nMR. ABRAMS:\nThe record before you shows that when these ads run,\npeople do make the calls. I asked Senator Feingold\nthat in the deposition I took of him. I asked him,\ndo you get calls? And the answer was yes, they do\nget calls. Now there's no doubt, and I want to\nrespond to this very directly, that many of these ads\ndo have both qualities, that is to say, they speak\nabout an issue, and they have an electoral component\nto them, and some of them don't, but many of them do.\nAnd we would urge on you that for you to say that an\nad of that sort is not fully protected by the First\nAmendment, not just in the abstract, but to be\napplied as you consider a statute like this, the\nDavid Wu ad.\nWhatever one concludes the underlying\npurpose was, and one can't know for sure to say that\na term limits organization cannot take an ad out in\nthe last 60 days of a campaign, and indeed it works\nout to be over 120 days in a presidential contest in\nthe sense of 60 days with respect to the election\ndate, 30 days for the national convention, 30 days\nalso for state conventions, primaries, so you are\ntalking about 120 days minimum --\nQUESTION: Mr. Abrams --\nMR. ABRAMS: -- of silence.\nQUESTION: Can I interrupt you with a sort\nof a --\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- basic question here? The\ndefinition of electioneering communications appears,\nI think, six or seven times in the statute and one\nsays there must be certain disclosures and other --\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nQUESTION: There must be something in the\nad itself identifying the sponsor. It prevents\nforeign nationals from contributing to these ads and\nso forth. Do you contend that it's unconstitutional\nin all its applications, specifically, for example,\nthe requirement that they disclose who paid for the\nparticular ad?\nMR. ABRAMS: Your Honor, my client is not,\nhas not raised constitutional objections in this\nCourt to the disclosure requirements and, with the\nexception of 504, which is a broadcast --\nQUESTION: And how about the reporting\nrequirement, the requirement that they report to the\nCommission who the sponsors are?\nMR. ABRAMS: Similarly there --\nQUESTION: No objection --\nMR. ABRAMS: -- but that is not because,\nsince you ask, it's not because we don't think that\nthe definition is unconstitutional for the same\nreasons every time it's used. I mean, if we're right\nthat this definition, put Buckley aside for the\nmoment, that this definition is fatally overbroad for\nFirst Amendment reasons.\nQUESTION: In all its applications.\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes. If it sweeps in so much\nmore than the First Amendment --\nQUESTION: But the requirement that is\nimposed by the definition in some instances is merely\ndisclosing who paid for the ads.\nMR. ABRAMS: That's true. And that's one\nof the reasons that we did not raise in this Court an\nissue about disclosure now. But you should --\nQUESTION: Another requirement is that\nforeign nationals may not pay for such things.\nMR. ABRAMS: That's right. But that's not\nchallenged. The --\nQUESTION: So it could be constitutional\nin some applications and not others?\nMR. ABRAMS: I think it is overbroad in\nall respects. It, it could be constitutional.\nQUESTION: But when you say overbroad, you\nmean it's too broad to be constitutional.\nMR. ABRAMS: Constitutionally overbroad,\nyes. I think one can make a case, and again, we\ndidn't challenge the foreign part of it at all that\nthere may be different considerations afoot there\nwhich would perhaps change the dynamics of your\ndecision making. I do want to point out that on the\nbasic disclosure matter that although we, that is to\nsay, Senator McConnell, does not challenging that,\nthe ACLU is challenging it, and they have made that\nargument in their brief and they have made it at\nlength and powerfully to the effect that the\ndisclosure requirements as per Buckley should be the\nsame as the requirement or the viability of a\nrequirement not to say something, as well as certain\nprinciples of anonymity. As I say, that's not the\nargument that we're making.\nQUESTION: Your principal challenge is to\nthe requirement that these ads be paid for with hard\nmoney?\nMR. ABRAMS: That's one way to say it,\nJustice Stevens. The way I would say it is that our\nprincipal objection is that this is a content-based\nrestriction on speech which punishes speech of --\nQUESTION: Punishes it only to the extent\nthat it identifies who or who may not pay for it.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, to the extent that PACs\nare asserted as an alternative --\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about PACs,\nusing hard money as an alternative.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, hard money, it's really\nthe equivalent of PACs in this situation. I mean,\nhard money when you talk about the AF of L, for\nexample, what is hard money when they spend their own\nmoney on their own ad? It's one thing to say they\nhave to do it through a PAC. We think it's\nunconstitutional to force that with respect to every\nmention of the President of the United States. It's\nsomething else to treat it as if somebody else is\ngiving the money. This is not a contribution\nsituation in which the concept of hard money comes\ninto play. That's why I was rephrasing it in terms\nof PACs.\nLet me say, in conclusion, one or two\nfinal things. This is, this section, with what we\nconsider its overbreadth, is illustrative of the\nfailures and constitutional indifference by the\nCongress to First Amendment norms as a whole. One of\nthe other sections we're challenging is Section 305,\nwhich is the section which says under the title,\nlimitation of availability, of lowest unit charged\nfor Federal candidates attacking opposition. This is\na section which basically says in so many words,\ncandidates have to pay more money or make more\ndisclosure.\nQUESTION: I don't think that's right. It\nsays they don't get a statutory entitlement to a\ncheaper rate.\nMR. ABRAMS: That's right.\nQUESTION: That's what it says.\nMR. ABRAMS: And therefore --\nQUESTION: They don't necessarily have to\npay more money if the station doesn't charge them\nmore money.\nMR. ABRAMS: I represent the National\nAssociation of Broadcasters here. I think I can say\nthere is a chance they might have to pay more if the\nstatute -- if the statute did not require lowest unit\nrate.\nQUESTION: What the statute does is take\naway a statutory entitlement, not require that they\npay a higher price.\nMR. ABRAMS: It takes away a statutory\nentitlement for what?\nQUESTION: Which itself is content-based.\nMR. ABRAMS:\nentirely content-based. They take them away --\nQUESTION: But they're going to have to\nmake the disclosures anyway, aren't they? I'd like\nto get clear on that. Even if this were\nunconstitutional, the other provisions that require\nthem just about the same disclosures?\nQUESTION: Specifically 311.\nQUESTION: So we're talking about\nbasically nothing, is that right? I'd like an answer\nto that, because I -- just to clarify it in my mind.\nQUESTION: The section is 311 and it seems\nto me to require virtually the identical disclosure\nthat 305 does.\nMR. ABRAMS: You do not have to under 311\nhave a printed statement identifying that the\ncandidate approved and authorized the ad. You do not\nhave to have the image of a candidate for four\nseconds.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Abrams.\nMR. ABRAMS: Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD\nON BEHALF OF AFL-CIO\nMR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nEarlier this term in the Nike case, the\nAFL-CIO took the unusual step of filing an amicus\nbrief arguing that the vital First Amendment interest\nin public access to information and ideas leaves the\nGovernment no room to inhibit business corporations\nfrom speaking out on matters of public concern.\nToday, we appear on our own behalf and aligned with\nbusiness corporations and non-profit incorporated\ngroups in support of that same principle. I would\nlike to pick up --\nQUESTION: Are you Laurence Gold?\nMR. GOLD: I am Laurence Gold. We're not\nrelated.\nQUESTION: Not the Laurence Gold I\nexpected.\nMR. GOLD: I'm also instructed by your\nrules not to introduce myself. I would like to first\nrevisit the PAC point, and then also address the\nback-up definition of electioneering communications\nin the distinct but very vital issue of coordination\nin this case.\nQUESTION: Would you at some point, if you\nhave the chance, deal with what is a genuine problem\nfor me? I think labor unions and corporations for\n30, 40, 50, 60 years have been forbidden to make\nexpenditures in connection with a Federal election.\nNow, unless you're attacking that whole thing, I take\nit what this turns is what Mr. Abrams said,\noverbreadth. It goes too far in defining the ads, an\nadded burden with the PAC. I have taken in both\nthose. I'll check them out.\nI want to know the other half of the\nequation, that is, I'd like you to spend one minute\nexplaining to me why I'm wrong in thinking that if\nyou win on this point, that thing that's been there\nin the statute since 1919, we might as well throw it\naway, and or, you know, they'll make expenditures in\nconnection with an election, namely these huge ads,\nand they will collect loads of money from the same\nwealthy people to help them along with those\nexpenditures. I'd just like one minute on that point\nat your convenience.\nMR. GOLD: I'll do it now, Justice Breyer.\nThe prescription of expenditures in the law which\ndates back to the 1940s was first defined by this\ncourt in Buckley and then in MCFL to mean express\nadvocacy, and that in fact is the only kind of\nexpenditure that the law has prescribed, and there is\nonly one instance where this Court has even approved\na restriction of those kinds of expenditures on any\nparty or any kind of organization that is subject to\n203, and that was of course the Austin case. But the\nnotion that expenditures in an untrammeled sense or\nan unbounded sense --\nQUESTION: Well, they've given you a new\ndefinition, and that's the issue, of course, is this\nnew definition okay, and we are back to where we\nstarted. If the old one is okay given those problems\nin the '40s, why isn't the new one okay given the\nproblems of the '90s? All right. But anyway, you go\nahead.\nMR. GOLD: Well, it wasn't clear really in\nthe '40s what the term expenditure met. There were\ntwo cases, the UEW case and the CIO case, that\nexplored that and pointed out that there was some\ndoubt there. In this case, the notion has been\nbrought into, way beyond anything that might affect\nan election. The mere, the touchstone of this\nstatute is, if you refer to a candidate within a\ncertain time to a certain audience, you are\nprescribed from doing so. And this record shows the\nsubjective aspect of it, I think, that the Buying\nTime studies underscored, I think the defendants no\nlonger subscribe to.\nBut the evidence in the record is replete\nwith instances where groups use ads not even in the\nmixed sense that Buckley said was very important, but\nin the sense of doing something that's urgently\nnecessary for the organization at the time. For\nexample, three AFL-CIO ads that ran in quick\nsuccession in September 1998 denied, in Barker and\nSpearmint, all addressed legislation that the\nRepublican majority on issues of grave concerns to\nthe AFL-CIO had hastily scheduled, and we came up, we\ndevised ads in a few days' notice and broadcast ads\nin a number of states in order to pressure particular\nMembers of Congress in the Senate and the House on\nhow they should vote on that legislation on a vote\nthat was actually taking place five days later. It\nwas pure happenstance that that vote occurred in\nSeptember of 1998 rather than say September of 1999,\nwhen this prescription would not have been upon us.\nQUESTION: But could -- could I interrupt\nagain? You're not really prescribed for money in\nthem, you're really prescribed from using union\nfunds, and one of the reasons for that is that some\nunion members may disagree with your position.\nMR. GOLD: Well, this makes -- there's a\ntremendous difference between the union doing it and\nthe union having to do it from a PAC. And to force a\nunion, for example, to do this sort of spending out\nof its PAC would reverse the notion that this court\nhas followed in a series of cases from Machinists v.\nStreet through Beck that the dissent of a union\nmember on matters is not to be presumed, that people\ndon't have to opt in to speaking, that they, at best\none can require somebody to opt out.\nQUESTION: Yes, but from the Taft-Hartley\nAct on, it's been understood, I thought, that one\nobjection to the union's spending its own money was\nit may not reflect the views of all its members.\nThat's true of issue ads and election ads.\nMR. GOLD: Well, in Austin, when the Court\naddressed this in the context of business\ncorporations, it pointed out that there were crucial\ndifferences between corporations and unions on\nprecisely this point, that the two governmental\ninterests.\nAnd the only case where this Court has\never approved an actual restriction on express\nadvocacy, the two interests identified there are the\ntwo aspects of the entity there, namely aggregation\nof wealth -- or the immense aggregation of wealth by\nvirtue of the corporate forum, not aggregation of\nwealth alone.\nreflected the views of members or shareholders this\nCourt pointed out were inapplicable to unions.\nSo the premise I think doesn't necessarily\napply. And the speech we're talking about here, of\ncourse, goes well beyond even the express advocacy\nexpenditures at issue in Austin. Express advocacy is\ndifferent. Express advocacy, whatever the value of\nwhether or not it should be regulated, is certainly\nunambiguous in two senses.\nOne, there is a specific request for\nvoting decision. And two, it is virtually certain\nthat the listener is going to take that into account\nas to whether or not to make a voting decision. You\ncan't say that, I think, about any other kind of\nspeech, including speech that makes reference to\ncandidates.\nAnd the burdens here, I think to pick up\non the discussion earlier, are very important with\nrespect to a PAC. It's one thing for an advocacy\norganization, like the NRA and the ACLU, which can\nand routinely do appeal for funds to the general\npublic to be restrained as Mr. Abrams described.\nBut unions and corporations don't have the\nability to seek contributions just from anybody.\nThere is the notion in the statute of a restricted\nclass.\nQUESTION: They could seek them but they\nwouldn't be very successful.\nMR. GOLD: No, actually, Your Honor, they\n't.\nQUESTION: They can't sekk --\nMR. GOLD: They can to their general treasury, but\nwith\nrespect to a PAC, you are limited to soliciting only,\nin the case of a union, your members or your\nexecutive administrative staff and their families.\nIn the case of a business corporation,\nonly your shareholders and executive administrative\npersonnel. These are not organizations that can for\ntheir PACs seek contributions from anybody else.\nIt's long been unlawful under the Federal Election\nCampaign Act to solicit beyond those classes.\nQUESTION: Is there any empirical\ninformation on this problem in the record?\nMR. GOLD: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Is there any empirical\ninformation on this? I think it's fairly\nsignificant. You're saying it's really much, much\nharder for us to get the money through the PAC. And\nit either is or it isn't. And there either is some\nempirical information or there isn't. I just want to\nknow the state-of-the-art.\nMR. GOLD: Yeah, well, there is some. In\nfact, the only judge below who made findings on this\nwas Judge Henderson. In her findings on this in the\nSupplemental Appendix at pages 249, 50, 259 to 60,\n270 to 71, which concern the AFL-CIO's difficulty in\nraising PAC money. And page 347, note 142.\nIt refers -- there is an affidavit by the\nthen AFL-CIO political director describing the\ndifficulty of raising PAC money and how that would\nnot change, certainly perhaps be even worsened under\nthis new regime. And there are affidavits that\nthe -- I think as part of the RNC submission from\nfour other labor organizations that describe the\nrelative resources of their organizations and their\nPACs.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, I take it you are\narguing that a labor union or a corporation, for that\nmatter, has a First Amendment right to speak on\nbehalf of more than its membership or respectively\nits stockholders. Why should that be?\nMR. GOLD: Well, I think that's one way to\nlook at it, but I think what this Court has pointed\nout in a number of cases, and Belotti is a\nparticularly -- a pertinent case for this, is that\nit's not so much the speaker. The value of speech is\nnot so much from the source, whether it's a union or\ncorporation or some other group.\nThe value of speech is the informational\nvalue that it gets to the public at large, the\nenabling that that speech does for people to\nparticipate in civic life. And the fact that it's\nfrom a corporate source or for a union source does\nnot devalue that speech.\nSo it's not so much that the speaker has a\nFirst Amendment right as such, but the value of that\nspeech to the populus as a whole --\nQUESTION: Then you are saying, I think,\nthat there is a kind of First Amendment volume\nrequirement that goes well beyond what in the\ncontribution context we referred to as reducing the\nspeech to something that doesn't amount to anything\nat all.\nYou're saying that when we're talking\nabout direct expenditures, when an organization is\nspeaking that way, that there really is a kind of\nvolume criterion, that has nothing to do with\nmembership.\nMR. GOLD:\ncriterion in the sense -- volume --\nQUESTION: Volume, are you saying?\nV-o-l-u-m-e?\nQUESTION: That's what I meant.\nQUESTION: Well, that's the say Justice\nSouter pronounces it.\nQUESTION: It's my distinct regional\naccent again. I've just come back from New\nHampshire.\nMR. GOLD: I think there is a volume\neffect by this statute and I think that's clearly\npart of the intention of this.\nQUESTION: So the interest you're\nvindicating here is all the television viewers during\nelection periods seeing all these 30 minute spots\nover and over and over again , that's the interest.\nMR. GOLD: Your Honor, that's --\nQUESTION: That is part of the interest.\nMR. GOLD: It certainly is part of the\ninterest. I mean, there is a tremendous interest in\npeople and groups and organizations being able to address\npublic issues. And the election period, which this\nCourt has identified and which the record supports,\nincluding one of the -- at least one of the\nDefendant's experts, Mr. Magleby, is that that's a\ntime when people are especially attentive to public\nissues.\nAnd the fact that some of this speech may\nseem to have a, quote, effect on the election, which\nis after all the standard that the Defendants now\njustify this for, the fact that there might be some\neffect can't possibly be a reason in order to stifle\nit. If we start down that road --\nQUESTION: Then why is that not true with\na political party? Why wouldn't you say the same\nthing with a candidate? And why is it, if we can\nlimit the expenditure, the contributions made to the\ncandidate for this kind of thing or the party, why\ncouldn't we do it to organizations that have less to\ndo with political life, for corporations?\nMR. GOLD: I think Title I has both\ncontribution and expenditure aspects. But here one\nis talking about limiting the independent speech.\nThat's the premise of section 203 is that this is --\nQUESTION: No, I think the premise is pay\nfor it out of your PAC. Not to limit the speech but\nrather pay for it out of certain limited\ncontributions. And I understand your argument that\nthat's harder to do. It's also maybe harder to do\nfor a party.\nMR. GOLD: It's not just harder to do, but\nit really does, I think, distort the message. It\ninherently is distorting a message that is\nnonelectoral if you have to do out of a PAC. If you\nhave to tell people you're soliciting for this fund.\nIt's not enough I think to label it something.\nThe law has imposed a structure on these\ncommittees. They are political committees. They\nregister with the Federal Election Commission.\nMembers of these organizations are used to the fact\nthat they are designed and used for making\ncontributions.\nQUESTION: The reason -- my question was\nthe reason that the union or the corporation has a\ngreater right here than the political party itself or\nthe candidate is?\nMR. GOLD: It's that it is -- it's not at\nall connected with the concerns of corruption or\nappearance of corruption that have animated and\nunderlie this Court's jurisprudence when it comes to\ncontributions. This is independent private speech.\nAnd from Buckley on and New York Times versus\nSullivan, this Court has recognized the value of\nspeech, even about elections by these groups. There\nis no rationale for muting their ability to speak on\npublic matters and speak on electoral matters.\nQUESTION: One of the themes of Buckley\nwas it's not up to the government to decide there is\ntoo much speech coming from one place and not enough\ncoming from another.\nMR. GOLD: Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And I think one of the -- something that\nseems to animate this is the thought that certain\nvoices do have to be muted. And I think the\nprinciple in Buckley, the fact that speech --\ninevitably speech on candidates, speech on issues,\nthat it's inevitably mixed in, inextricably linked,\nis really at issue in this case.\nBecause what this statute says is when\nthat's the case, you silence it, you make it criminal\nor you force people to raise money separately under a\nseparate rubric and call it electionary\ncommunications, and call it --\nQUESTION: If you're right, the prior law\ngoes down the drain, too, doesn't it?\nMR. GOLD: Well, no, Your Honor, I don't\nthink that follows.\nQUESTION: It's certainly muting, it's\nbeen regulating for 60 years, longer than that in\ncorporations cases.\nMR. GOLD: It's been regulating express\nadvocacy alone.\nQUESTION: Yes. Why should express\nadvocacy be disfavored. Justice Stevens' question\nall over again.\nMR. GOLD: I think that's a fair question\nthat the Court does not have to reach in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, I think we have to reach\nit if we're going to accept your premise.\nMR. GOLD: This case, in our view, turns\non the overbreadth, regardless of whether express\nadvocacy is regulable. This provision, we believe,\ngoes down -- and should go down on the basis of\noverbreadth. One could assume that express\nadvocacy --\nQUESTION: When you say overbreadth, you\nsay because it goes beyond express advocacy. Isn't\nthat all you mean.\nMR. GOLD: It's because -- leaving express\nadvocacy aside --\nQUESTION: No, but isn't that what you\nmean? Isn't that your principal overbreadth point?\nMR. GOLD: Yes, in the sense that it\ngoes -- express advocacy by definition is not an\nelectionary communication. The statute says that.\nIt's everything else. This is overbroad, not just\nbecause some of the speech might influence -- might\naffect an election, or influence an election, but\nthat it's criminalizing references to candidates --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gold.\nMr. Sekulow, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY ALAN SEKULOW\nON BEHALF OF MINOR PLAINTIFFS\nMR. SEKULOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe court below unanimously concluded that\nsection 318, the prohibition of contributions by\nminors is unconstitutional. The statute suffers from\nthree constitutional defects. First, section 318 is\na ban, not simply a limitation. No symbolic or\nassociational speech rights are recognized under 318.\nSecond, the government failed to produce\nsufficient evidence to show that there was corruption\nor the appearance of corruption with regard to\nconduit giving by minors. The fact of the matter is,\nJudge Henderson called the evidence remarkably thin.\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly called the evidence so minimal\nas to, in her words, doom the statute.\nSection 318 is not closely drawn in\nsupport of the interests being asserted. In fact,\nthe government concedes that this statute is an\nabsolute ban and they also concede that, in fact, the\nban burdens more speech than a limitation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sekulow, could you have a\nban at any age? Is it 17 year olds that ban is\nquestionable. But say the Congress drew the line at\n8 or 10.\nMR. SEKULOW: Certainly that would be more\nclosely drawn, Justice --\nQUESTION: Would that be constitutional?\nMR. SEKULOW: I think so. The issue would\nbe could an 8 year-old make the voluntary decision to\nmake a contribution. I think it would be a closer\ncase. This is an absolute ban, though. This is the\nexact opposite of that situation. Rather than\nlooking at a concern over --\nQUESTION: I'm posing an absolute ban on\ncontributions by 10 and under.\nMR. SEKULOW: I think it would be the same\nargument. At a minimum, there would have to be --\nthey would have to establish that the ban was\njustified by at least a -- closely drawn to the\nconcern. I think when you get -- the younger it gets\nobviously it is more of a problem.\na ban actually --\nQUESTION: I just want to be clear on what\nyour answer is. I thought you said that there would\nbe a line, a bright, clear line that could be drawn\nat some age, only not 17.\nMR. SEKULOW: All legislation is line\ndrawing. Here --\nQUESTION: What's the answer? An 8\nyear-old? Nobody under the age of 8 can give a\ncontribution, period, end of the matter, that's it,\nthat's the law, constitutional or not.\nQUESTION: In a sense, the problem\ndiminishes with the age. There aren't a great number\n8 --\nMR. SEKULOW: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- year olds making contributions.\nMR. SEKULOW: That's exactly correct, Mr.\nChief Justice. And the fact is, as Judge Leon\nrecognized, the younger the child gets, the less\nlikely are they to have resources. But here again,\nas the government concedes, this is an absolute ban\nfor 17 and under. It is not worrying about just two\nyear-olds or four-year-olds or eight-year-olds.\nQUESTION: I'd still appreciate an answer.\nSix month old, right?\nMR. SEKULOW: I'll give you the six-month\nold.\nQUESTION: Wonderful. Now, once you give\nme the six month old -- once you give me the six\nmonth old, you've agreed that at some age, it's\nreasonable to draw a line. And once you're down that\nroad, you have to deal with the obvious question that\nthe Constitution draws a line at 18 years old to\nvote.\nAnd after all, it was thought you needed a\nconstitutional amendment to get that result. And so\nwhat's wrong with Congress saying, well, we think the\nproblem's about the same when you give money to a\ncandidate as when you vote for a candidate. And so\nwe're going to pick the same line. There are many 17\nyear olds who would be excellent voters and there are\nmany older people who are terrible, okay? So they\npick this line for that, we would like this line for\nthis. And what's wrong with that?\nMR. SEKULOW: Justice Breyer, two things\nare wrong with that proposition. First, the First\nAmendment rights of speech and association are not\nsomehow contingent upon, dependent upon exercise of\nthe right to vote under the 26th.\nSecondly -- and a perfect example of that\nwould be prior to the passage of the 19th Amendment,\nwomen were denied the right to vote in the\nUnited States but they certainly could still exercise\nthe rights of speech and association to obtain the\nright of suffrage. And I think it would be exactly\nthe same argument.\nAlso, in fact, in 11 states, 17 year olds\nactually can vote in primaries so long as they reach\nthe age of 18 by the next general election. So there\nare states in which in fact it can be that the 17\nyear old can vote. But that I think also proves up\nthe problem here. And that is, if the government's\njustification for the prohibition -- and here this\nabsolute prohibition -- is in fact that there is a\nconcern over conduit giving, the existing regulations\nand existing law, 441(a) and (f), prohibit excess or\ncontributions given in the name of another, a conduit\ngift.\nThat is absolutely prohibited.\nContributions given in the name of another within the\nsame provision, prohibited. And of course, 441(a)\nprohibits gifts in excess of the contribution limits.\nThis statute doesn't say that a 17 year old who is --\nactually under this statute, a 17 year old who has\nher own means of support, who might even be\nemancipated, whose parents may have never given $1 to\na campaign are put in the situation where their gift\nis banned. It's unauthorized and inappropriate,\nillegal under the statute.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sekulow, you said in your\nbrief that you would accept even a severe limitation,\nbut not an absolute ban, so among severe limitations,\nwould it be constitutional to say, yes, 16, 17 year\nolds can give, but what they give is going to count\nagainst how much the parent or parents who claim the\nchild as a dependent can give.\nMR. SEKULOW: Actually, our -- our\ndiscussion about that restrictions relates to what\nsome of the other states have done by allowing gift.\nIf no states bans gifts by minors, some stays do impose\nwhat's called family contribution caps or\nlimitations. Again, certainly that would be more\nclosely drawn than an absolute prohibition.\nQUESTION: I just wanted to know what you\nmeant in your brief by you would accept a limitation,\neven a severe one. Is this one that you would\naccept?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, we would accept this\nfact. If the Government could establish through\nevidence that in fact somehow a restriction on the\nincremental amount allowed to be given would meet the\ncriteria of avoiding corruption or the appearance of\ncorruption, if the Government established that, sure,\nbut they haven't. I was using that as an --\nQUESTION: I'm not asking you about\nestablishing proof in one by one in an individual\ncase, because that wouldn't be worth anybody's time.\nCould the law say it will count against the parent or\nparents who take the child as a deduction?\nMR. SEKULOW: That would, I think it would\ncertainly make it more difficult, Justice Ginsburg,\nto make a facial challenge if the gift, the symbolic\ngift and the associational rights were recognized by\na cap. But again, this is a ban. It doesn't allow\nthat individual 17-year-old, 16-year-old, 15-year-old\nto make that gift. We were trying to show through\nthat, those examples of what some of the states have\ndone to allow gifts to made by minors but at the same\ntime putting what's called family caps in place. It\nwould certainly make it more difficult as a facial\nchallenge, but again, this is a prohibition event.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sekulow, is it necessary to\nrely on the First Amendment to reach your conclusion,\nor could you argue this an unreasonable restraint on\nliberty?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, I would argue both.\nQUESTION: You do argue both?\nMR. SEKULOW: I would. And I certainly\nwould assert again that what the individuals planned\non giving here is a liberty interest, but it's a --\nit's also speech, it's also association. The\nunderpinning of this Court's justifications for\nlimitations is the fact that an act of some type can\nbe given, a gift could be given. Here, it's a\ncomplete, again, a complete prohibition.\nQUESTION: Let's go to our jurisprudence\nwas where, where the restriction in question is\ninvalid or arguably invalid under a specific\nconstitutional guarantee, such as the First\nAmendment.\nMR. SEKULOW: Yes.\nQUESTION: You don't resort to substantive\ndue process to create some general liberty interest?\nMR. SEKULOW: Absolutely correct, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: So your answer should have been\nno.\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, okay. Then the answer\nwill be no. But it certainly is a First Amendment\ninterest, and that's what we've asserted throughout\nthis, that there is both the speech and the\nassociation --\nQUESTION: Giving money is the First\nAmendment, yeah.\nMR. SEKULOW: Yes, but that was -- the\nhypothetical was assuming that that wasn't available.\nHowever, the First Amendment --\nQUESTION: You'd rather have his vote than\nmine?\nMR. SEKULOW: Well, I would certainly like\nto have yours, Justice Stevens. The -- I think the\nbottom line of this ban is what came up in, was one\nof the opinions, is no one knows exactly where this\ncame from. There is no evidence that was submitted\nof any significance justifying this prohibition.\nAdministrative convenience in enforcement is\ncertainly not a basis for curtailing speech or\nassociational rights.\nQUESTION: Didn't the FEC have, didn't\nthey continuously write about this and say there\nseemed to be an awful lot of tiny children who are\nsending in money for your trust funds or something.\nMR. SEKULOW: Actually, Justice Breyer,\nthey wrote in a --\nQUESTION: What did they say?\nMR. SEKULOW: -- in the reports that there\nwas, they thought there was a concern, or evidence\nthat they said, there was concerns over conduit\ngiving. However, actually the FEC could never make\nthe conclusion, though, nor could Congress because\nneither Congress or the FEC ever asked for the age of\nthe donor, so they could not determine whether in\nfact there was a violation of conduit giving in and\nof itself, that's already prohibited under 441a and\nf. They don't even ask for the age of the\ncontributor, so to go from a situation, and by the\nway, they never asked for a complete ban. The FEC in\nall of its recommendations never asked for an\nabsolute ban on contributions by minors to be put in\nplace. They had a presumption issue for those that\nwere 15, 14, and 13, under 15 and under, but that was\na request for a presumption which was rebuttable,\nrebuttable under voluntariness, rebuttable if in fact\nit was from funds controlled by the minor and it\nwasn't a gift directed by the parent.\nFor these reasons, the fact that this is a\nban, this is not a limitation, we would request the\nCourt affirm. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sekulow.\nMr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF FEDERAL DEFENDANTS\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nIn enacting Title II of the Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act, Congress addressed a problem\nthat's been with us for 100 years, the corrosive and\ndistorting effects of aggregate corporate wealth on\ncandidate elections. In addressing that problem,\nCongress did not adopt a revolutionary approach,\nrather, Title II and its requirement that\ncorporations fund electioneering communications\nthrough a separate segregated fund simply represents\na contemporary chapter in the century-long history of\nregulation of corporate political giving.\nQUESTION: But it makes a big change.\nIt's one thing to say the corporation is\naffirmatively giving money to the candidate or naming\nthe candidate, but to say that a corporation cannot\ntake out an issue ad which happens to mention a\ncandidate, any candidate, Federal candidate during a\ncertain period, that goes far beyond whatever has\nhappened before, and what, you know, you talk about\ncorporations as though well, who needs corporations?\nIs there any significant segment of our economy that\nis not run by corporations? Can you think of any\nsignificant segment of our economy?\nMR. CLEMENT: No. There is no question\nthat corporations are very good at aggregating wealth\nin the corporate --\nQUESTION: Exactly. And if that segment\n--\nMR. CLEMENT: -- and in commerce, and the\nconcern --\nQUESTION: -- if that segment of an\neconomy, of the economy is attacked by a certain\npiece of legislation, which that segment of the\neconomy thinks is a very stupid piece of legislation,\nand it will entirely wash out nuclear energy or\nwhatever it is, to say that the American people who\nhave organized themselves economically through\ncorporations cannot through the same mode defend that\nsegment of the economy against irrational legislative\naction is to very much weaken, it seems to me, the\npower of the people to, to have a real say in the\nacts of the Government.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, as you say, Congress\nhas long been able to address express advocacy, and\nwhat the evidence, the overwhelming evidence before\nthe district court showed is that in a modern\npolitical campaign, the express advocacy test no\nlonger works. It no longer is -- it is a woefully\ninexact proxy for the kind of speech that affects\ncandidate elections that this Court has said\ncorporations must make through segregated, separate\nsegregated fund. This Court has --\nQUESTION: Any issue, any issue advocacy\naffects elections. That's the purpose of it\nultimately, to get the people to agree with whoever\nis making the issue ad about the issue and to elect\ncandidates who will come out that way. So it seems\nto me a very artificial distinction you're making.\nYou're --\nMR. CLEMENT: First of all, I don't --\nQUESTION: You're essentially saying you\ncannot have issue ads.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I don't\nthink it's artificial distinction. In any event,\nit's not a distinction I'm drawing. It's a\ndistinction that this Court drew in Austin when it\ndistinguished the situation it had before it in\nBelotti, where it said that a corporation facing an\nabsolute ban, not a separate segregated fund\nrequirement but an absolute ban in participating in a\nreferendum, this Court held that unconstitutional.\nIn Austin, this Court said that limits on express\nadvocacy in the context of a candidate campaign\ntriggered different interests, and in that context,\nCongress has a legitimate ability to deal with the\ncorrosive and distorting effects of aggregate\ncorporate wealth and the problems with diverting\nshareholder and member money to political causes with\nwhich they disagree.\nQUESTION: I think one of the -- one of\nthe dubious things about Austin is one of the things\nit relied on was the fact that the corporation's\nmembers or did not -- or owners did not necessarily\nrepresent a large amount of public opinion, and it\nseemed to me, I voted in the majority, but it seemed\nto me since then that that's the whole purpose of the\nFirst Amendment is to allow people who perhaps don't\nhave much in the way of public opinion try to change\npublic opinion.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, there are certainly\nways to do that, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what\nAustin represents incorrectly is the idea that when\ncorporate money is being aggregate for different\nreasons, that there is an interest on the part of the\nshareholders not to have that money diverted to\npolitical causes with which they disagree.\noutside of the corporate context, the principle that\nyou are advocating certainly applies. Individuals\nare able to advocate unpopular causes with their\nmoney and that is not a concern of Title II, but in\nthe corporate context this Court has drawn a\ndistinction, and that's not a distinction this Court\njust drew in the Austin decision. It's one that goes\nthrough this Court's decisions. It goes, and it\nstarts really from the Tillman Act in 1907 which\nrecognized that corporations are different.\nCorporations posed unique risks of corruption, so in\n1907, corporations and corporations alone were barred\nfrom making contributions to candidates.\nThen in 1947, that ban was extended to\nexpenditures, and in Austin, this Court quite\ncorrectly held up that as constitutional because of\nthe unique risks of the corporate context and what\nthe evidence before the district court showed is all\nof those same interests that applied in Austin to\nexpress advocacy equally apply to these kind of\nelectioneering communications.\nQUESTION: And doesn't -- doesn't the\nprimary definition today, in effect, give a\ncorporation or a union that wants to run an issue ad\na safe harbor simply by virtue of not mentioning the\nname? Say, let's hear it for nuclear power and don't\nlet anybody else tell you otherwise. That's safe,\nisn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right. That\nis safe, Justice Souter, and that's why all of the\nevidence before the district court that looks at\nretrospective ads running previous cycles has to be\nread in the light that one of the virtues of the\nclarity with which Title II defines electioneering\ncommunications is that a corporation can avoid the\ntrigger and that similar to current law, under\ncurrent law as we pointed out in our brief, the NRA\nput together two ads in the 2000 election cycle.\nThey were virtually identical, except one of them\nfinished with the tag line, vote for Bush. Now, the\nNRA --\nQUESTION: How, how, how do you -- how do\nyou protect it if what you're talking about is the\nMcCain-Feingold bill or the Roth IRA or something\nlike that, where the, where there is a candidate's\nname attached to specific legislation?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, let's, Justice\nO'Connor, let's take the McCain-Feingold provision,\nfor example. Now, first of all, one option, of\ncourse, is to refer to it the way I have, as the\nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act. It's important to\nremember, however, that the restrictions in this bill\ndon't restrict any corporation from talking about the\nMcCain-Feingold bill in 48 states or in fact all 50,\nas long as Senators McCain and Senator Feingold are\nnot up for election.\nNow, at the point that somebody wants to\nmake a reference to the McCain-Feingold, to one of\nthose Senators' voters in the immediate days running\nup to the election then they may not be referring to\nit in a way that has nothing to do with the election.\nThey may be referring to it as that no good\nMcCain-Feingold legislation, and it may clearly have\nan electioneering purpose.\nQUESTION: Now the Government has relied\nvery heavily this morning on the findings made by the\nCongress and by the district court. And this\nafternoon you are confronted with the fact that the\ndistrict court has said basically that the\ndistinction between express advocacy and issue ad is\nessentially meaningless and everybody knows it, so\nwhy should we base our decision on that distinction,\nwhen the district court has found, and I think\nthere's very little evidence to the contrary that\nit's simply ephemeral?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, we\nstart from the same proposition, which that\ndistinction no longer holds up as a practical matter\nof political reality. Now, I fear you may take the\nconclusion from that that we should just end this\nwhole enterprise, but we take from that the\nconclusion that Congress is not disabled from\naddressing the serious problems that this Court found\nthat it could address in Austin.\nQUESTION: Oh, so that you could come back\nnext year and say that the Congress, the pure issue\nads must also be prohibited?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice --\nQUESTION: I mean, that must, that's the\nnecessary consequence of what you just said.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, it's not, Justice\nKennedy. Just because the campaign finance laws need\nto be adjusted from time to time doesn't mean there\nare no limits and if you are looking for a limit in\nkeeping the distinction between this Court's decision\nand Belotti and this Court's decision in Austin, one\nclear limit is a reference to a candidate, because\nthat is one thing that clearly identifies an ad as\nbeing tied to the interests of the candidate election\ncycle.\nQUESTION: You want one of us to write an\nopinion for the Court sustaining the statute on a\nground which everyone knows is ephemeral and\nmeaningless?\nMR. CLEMENT: Certainly not, Justice\nKennedy. What we want to have this Court do is write\nan opinion that upholds a limitation on corporate and\nunion spending from direct treasury funds that\nreflects the current reality. I can't tell you\nwhether the decision that you would, that such a\ndecision upholding this legislation would still work\n25 years from now, but I can tell you that it will\nwork in the near term.\nAnd this Court has said, for example, in\nfootnote 11 in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that\nparticularly in the First Amendment area, Congress\ndoesn't have to anticipate every problem. It can\nrespond to the observed realities and the observed\nproblems before it and try to address those and\nthat's what Congress did with this provision.\nAs you say, the express advocacy test no\nlonger works. The candidates themselves, who have\nabsolutely no regulatory incentive to avoid express\nadvocacy, still themselves don't make reference,\ndon't make their pleas in those express terms.\nQUESTION: The observed reality, if\nhistory teaches us anything, is that when you plug\none means of expression, the money will go to\nwhatever means of expression are left and that will\ncontinue to be the observed reality and that means we\nwill continue to have new pieces of legislation that\nclose more and more methods of reaching the public.\nThis does not fill me with confidence and joy.\nMR. CLEMENT: With all respect, Justice\nScalia, that's a formula for surrender in response to\nwhat is clearly a problem that Congress has been\nwrestling with for the most part successfully for a\nhundred years, which is the corrosive and distorting\neffects of corporate wealth on candidate elections.\nQUESTION: I agree with you. You want us\nto say just what Justice Kennedy said, that the\ndistinction is ephemeral, right? Now, we've heard\nthe distinction is ephemeral. And if you can ban the\nexpress, you can ban the issue ad which mentions the\nname. And now there were two, I thought, safe\nharbors.\nSafe harbor number 1 is what Justice\nSouter said, don't mention the name of the candidate\n60 days before election. Safe harbor number 2, which\nI had been discussing before, which I wanted your\nresponse to, was the PAC. Now, I thought it wasn't\ntoo tough, say, for Philip Morris or Ciba Geigy, if\nthey really want to mention the candidate's name, to\nset up a PAC.\nNow, I've heard that that's not so, that I\nwas wrong about that. And the reason that I was\nwrong, I've just been told, as you heard too, is\nbecause it's going to be hard for these big\ncorporations and the labor unions to raise the money\nthrough the PAC to run the very ad with the name of\nthe candidate in the last 60 days.\nI would like your view about that. Do you\nthink that's right and not just subjectively, is\nthere any evidence about it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, the simple\nanswer is you were right all along. The separate --\nQUESTION: I would like to think that\nbut --\nMR. CLEMENT: The separate segregated fund\nrequirement is not an undue burden on corporate\npolitical activity. This is, after all, not the\nfirst case that this Court has dealt with the\nseparate segregated fund requirement. And of course\nthe requirement was made in Austin as well that, oh,\nmy, if we have to use the separate segregated fund,\nthat will be impossible. The Court rejected that\nargument there and Justice Brennan in his concurrence\naddressed it and made two very good points.\nFirst, in footnote 7, he said that that\njust doesn't reflect the observed reality, that the\nMichigan Chamber of Commerce there was very\nsuccessful in raising funds for its PAC. At that\ntime, success was measured $140,000. It seems quaint\nbecause what this record says is that the NRA in the\nPolitical Victory Fund was able to raise $17 million\njust for its PAC.\nQUESTION: Did anyone else join Justice\nBrennan's opinion in that case?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, that was a concurrence\nthat reflected the views of the majority.\nQUESTION: Did other people join his\nopinion?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, they didn't, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but I think that it is certainly -- I'm not\nsuggesting that it binds this Court in any way. I'm\njust suggesting that Justice Brennan's logic in\naddressing that problem has persuasive force. It is\ntrue also that the majority opinion of Justice\nMarshall in that case, also noted, described the\nMichigan Chamber of Commerce in that case as being\nquite successful in its PAC. And also specifically\nsaid in the majority opinion that they were success\nas -- to the tune of $140,000. That Justice Brennan\namplified that point in his concurrence.\nQUESTION: Well, is there a way of writing\nan opinion that would say, if a particular\norganization otherwise covered does have some unusual\nproblem with a PAC, either because it doesn't want to\nsay it's political or because it can't raise the\nmoney, that's a matter for an as-applied challenge\nlater?\nMR. CLEMENT: The Court could certainly\nsay that, Justice Breyer, and I think should say\nthat. The remarkable thing about the challenge to\nthe separate segregated fund requirement here, if I\nunderstand it, is that the gravamen of the concern\nseems to be that the solicitation restrictions on the\nseparate segregated fund make it difficult to raise\nenough money.\nNow, the reason I find that so surprising\nis there was a direct challenge to those solicitation\nrequirements before this Court in the National Right\nto Work Committee case. And this Court unanimously\nrejected that challenge.\nSo the solicitation requirements and the\nseparate segregated fund, which by the way were not\nchanged by BCRA and therefore really probably aren't\neven jurisdictionally before this Court, those -- if\nsomebody has a problem with the solicitation\nrequirements either on their face or as applied,\nthat's open to them in an as-applied challenge.\nQUESTION: It depends on whether -- the\nfact that we said that it's okay in another context\ndoesn't mean that it's okay in this context. It\ndepends on what the consequence of not being able to\ndo it except through a PAC happens to be. And here\nthe consequence is very severe indeed.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, the\nconsequence is entirely speculative on this record.\nAs I say, some groups even under the current system\nhave been able to assemble massive amounts of money\nin their political action committees. And that is\nremarkable if for no other reason that as Justice\nKennedy pointed out, it's sort of no reason to do it\nunder the current system, because one of the main\nreasons to put money in your political action fund\nwas so that you could engage in express advocacy\nrather than issue advocacy.\nQUESTION: It seems to me the burden ought\nto be on you to demonstrate that it won't hurt them,\nnot on them to demonstrate that it will. You are\npreventing them from using their money for speech.\nYou're saying this -- your normal money can't be used\nfor it. You have to get money from some other\nsource. And you want them to have to demonstrate\nthat this will harm them.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, with\nrespect, this issue is no different than the parallel\nissue in the context of Austin. That was speech,\ntoo. That was a burden of speech. And as some of\nthe Justices pointed out, there is not one word in\nBuckley or in Austin that suggests that express\nadvocacy is somehow second class speech.\nIndeed, there is no higher protected\nspeech than vote for Bush or vote for Gore, yet\nnonetheless, the restrictions there were upheld by\nthe Court and there were not --\nQUESTION: Five to four and don't blame it\non me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: Very well, Justice Scalia,\nbut I'll take the five to four. And many of the\narguments that are being raised in opposition to this\nstatute are the arguments of the dissenters in\nAustin, not the arguments of the majority opinion in\nAustin. And I think that's an important point.\nThis Court has approved the same basic\nmechanism in the context of express advocacy. It has\nworked well perhaps not with the definition of\nexpress advocacy, but has worked well in terms of the\nseparate segregated fund requirement.\nThe other point I think that has to be\nmade about the separate segregated fund requirement\nis that the idea that, okay, let's say that we now\nhave meaningful limits so there are going to be some\nreal incentives to put some money in your political\naction committee or your separate segregated fund.\nOne of two things can happen.\nWith some organizations, it may very well\nturn out that some of the people who were members of\nthe overall organization, turns out they really\nweren't 100 percent interested in supporting the\npolitical causes of that organization. They sort of\nlike some of the other benefits of membership. And\nin that case, the amount of money that would be\nraised will be reduced.\nIn some other organizations, it may be\nthat every member of the organization supports the\npolitical cause and they give the money to the\nseparate segregated fund.\npurposes of the separate segregated fund are fully\nvindicated because the resulting corporate political\nactivity at that point will reflect the views of the\nunderlying membership and the underlying union\nmembers, which is precisely what this Court said was\na compelling interest in Austin.\nQUESTION: Can a corporation spend any\nmoney, whether for political speech purposes or\notherwise, that is not directed towards the fostering\nof its business? Wouldn't they be leaving themselves\nopen to a lawsuit by the shareholders?\nMR. CLEMENT: There is certainly a large\nbody of state law about corporate waste that is, if I\nremember it from law school, fairly impenetrable and\ndoesn't provide a lot of specific guidance in\nparticular consequences, in particular cases.\nBut I would say that that same issue again\nwas raised in Austin, and this Court said that it was\nnot sufficient simply to leave everything to the\nstate law of waste, where you have the business\njudgment rule, and everything's set up to make sure\nthat no corporation is ever held liable.\nThis Court said that in this particular\ncontext, it was much more appropriate to use the\nseparate segregated fund requirement which has been\npart of the law and functionally since 1947 --\nQUESTION: I am raising the question to\nrespond to your point that shareholders don't agree\nwith every jot and tittle of what the corporation\ndoes. They don't in the economic field either. Very\noften some of the things that corporations should\ndivest itself of a certain business, others think\nthey shouldn't. They have ceded to the organization\n-- this is part of belonging to an organization --\nthe responsibility to determine what is in the\ninterest of that corporation.\nAnd it seems to me that is no less true\nwith respect to political, especially issue ads as to\nwhat issues are important for that corporation's\nsurvival. I don't know why all of a sudden we insist\non unanimity among the shareholders when it comes to\nthat very important issue.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think again, Justice\nScalia, the resort I would take is to the Austin\ndecision, which rejected that argument as well. And\nit did so on the basis that candidate elections are\ndifferent than other situations. It may be a bit of\nan affront for a shareholder to have their money\nspent on an issue that they don't particularly care\nfor, or to have the corporation go into some new line\nof business that the shareholder thinks, boy, that's\nreally not very smart, you should stick with what you\nknow best. That's an affront.\nBut it's a much greater affront to have\nthat individual's money spent on candidate elections\nwhere that individual does not agree with the\nposition that the corporation has taken.\nAnd let me just add --\nQUESTION: You said any mention of the\ncandidate makes it a candidate ad and not an issue\nad.\nMR. CLEMENT: I thought that's the\nposition you were taking earlier, because I think\nthere is a sense in which any time -- if you're\ntalking about ads within 60 days from election that\nare targeted to a candidate's home district then I\nthink -- and mention that candidate, I think it's a\nsafe assumption to be made that they at least have a\nmixed motive.\nAnd one of the motives is to influence the\ncandidate election. And I think if the corporate\nconsciously decides to link its issue up to a\ncandidate election, then it's a perfectly appropriate\nresponse to make that corporation funded through a\nseparate segregated fund.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, I think just as a\nmatter of history, that the decision in the Belotti\nagainst First National Bank of Boston invalidated the\nstatute that was really typical throughout the\nUnited States at the time. Generally, there was in\nthe olden times a policy against using corporate\nfunds for political purposes at all. So the history\nI think is consistent with the position here.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right. And this\nCourt took a different step over the Chief Justice,\namong others' dissents and said no, we're going to\ninvalidate that traditional approach. But then in\nAustin, this Court drew an important distinction\nbetween the candidate election context and the issue\ncontext.\nI was talking a minute ago about the mixed\nmotives and I did want to be responsive to a question\nthat Justice Souter had asked earlier, which is this\nquestion about in the specific studies that Congress\nand the district court discussed, was mixed motive an\noption for the people that were scoring the ads.\nAnd as a matter of fact, it was not. The\nstudents were asked whether or not the issue in the\nparticular ad had a tendency to support or go against\na candidate, or if it addressed an issue. There was\nno mixed motive box, and I think the net effect of\nthat is that whatever overbreadth is estimated by the\nstudies, it actually overstates the overbreadth\nbecause it didn't account for the mixed motive case.\nAnd as I say, I think the mixed motive\ncase does reflect the reality in a number of\nsituations. But I do think that the point that a\ncorporation makes that conscious decision to link\nsome controversial issue to a candidate election, at\nthat point, the interest that this Court found\nsufficient in Austin are fully implicated.\nQUESTION: One of the briefs argues that\nfrequently these issues are before Congress almost at\nthe same time the election comes up, because the\nCongress is catching up perhaps on things that it\ndidn't do earlier in the session.\nAnd so it's not the corporation's\nvoluntary choice to put it up there. That's the time\nit has to do it, if it's going to do any good.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, and the safe harbors\nthat we talked about earlier are still available in\nthat situation. And they are, as Justice Breyer\npointed out, twofold.\nOne, if all the corporation is really\nconcerned about is a pending legislative issue, it\ndoesn't need to make a reference to the candidate and\nit can run the issue through treasury funds. On the\nother hand, if they want to make a specific reference\nto the candidate, tie that legislative issue to the\nbroader context of the campaign, then they're free to\ndo so as long as they do so through their separate\nsegregated fund.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, why do you make an\nexception for these corporations, these aggregations\nof vast wealth that happen to own television\nstations? General Electric, for example, which, if I\nrecollect correctly, owns NBC. Why is it perfectly\nokay for them to have issue ads, name candidates,\noppose candidates? They're not covered, there's an\nexception for that.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, first of all, Justice\nScalia, as I understand the media exemption, it\napplies to the media corporation but not necessarily\nto the entire corporation, so I don't think --\nQUESTION: Well, just NBC, which is owned\nby General Electric. So everybody should go out and\nget himself a television station, right?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't know about that.\nWhat I do know is that media corporations are\nexempted for the same reason they've always been\nexempted from the law, which is that they do pose a\ndifferent situation, a difference of kind. And this\nCourt --\nQUESTION: And why is that? Why is that?\nI don't understand that.\nMR. CLEMENT: I mean, I think the\ntraditional role of media companies has been quite\ndifferent than the traditional role of other\ncompanies.\nQUESTION: What case do you have that we\ncan distinguish speech based on the identity of the\nspeaker? Outside of this area?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know. I've\nbeen focused on this area for the last couple of\nweeks, Justice Kennedy, and the case that comes to\nmind is Austin, where the Michigan statute before\nthis Court --\nQUESTION: You really like Austin, don't\nyou?\nMR. CLEMENT: I love Austin. It's binding\nprecedent. I don't, I mean, as much as the\nplaintiffs don't seem to like the case, I don't\nreally hear them asking this Court to overrule it.\nQUESTION:\nserious question. A large part of -- of the\nnecessity, or at least the perceived necessity for\nthese ads is to counter the influence of the press.\nThis -- this is a very serious First Amendment issue.\nMR. CLEMENT: I know it is, Justice --\nQUESTION: And you have -- and you have no\nauthority for this distinction.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't Buckley a point on\nthis? Wasn't there an exception in the statute in\nBuckley?\nQUESTION: It wasn't challenged, though.\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes. I don't think that\nparticular provision --\nQUESTION: They didn't challenge it.\nThat's the reason.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. But it was brought\ninto full focus in the Austin case, and the argument\nwas made there, as it's made here, that the statute\nis somehow underinclusive because it doesn't include\nmedia corporations, and I -- it is a difficult issue,\nI will admit, but I think this is an area where\nsometimes it is just as much a problem to treat\ndifferent entities the same as it is to treat similar\nentities differently.\nQUESTION: But you were -- you were going\nto explain why this difference exists, and I don't\nthink you've done that yet.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think the difference is\nthat because of the traditional role of what a media\ncorporation does, there is, there's an inherent\ninvolvement in the political process. This Court\nrecognized that, I think at least implicitly in Mills\nagainst Alabama, when you had a situation where there\nwas an effort to apply a statute to a newspaper, and\nI think because of the role of the media, there is a\nrecognition that a different rule should apply to the\nmedia, and again, this is -- this is no revolution in\nthe, in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. This is\njust carrying through --\nQUESTION: Well, what, what about say the\nNational Rifle Association? It's against gun laws.\nA media corporation is very much in favor of gun\nlaws, it prints editorials, perhaps it even slants,\nGod forbid, its coverage of the subject. There is a\nsubstantial difference, substantial similarity there,\nisn't there?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, there certainly is the\nsimilarity in the sense that they're both addressing\nthe same issue, but I do think that again this Court\nhas drawn that distinction in the Austin case and\nCongress has drawn that distinction throughout its\ncampaign finance reform. This is not some new\nprovision.\nQUESTION: But what do you think should be\nthe underlying valid principle that allows that\ndistinction to be drawn?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think the under --\nQUESTION: Why is it that a group of\ncitizens concerned about what they consider to be\nslanted press cannot get together, have a corporation\nand take out issue ads on the other side of that\nissue?\nMR. CLEMENT: Oh, absolutely they can, and\nI think if what you're talking about is running an\nissue about the slanted press, I can't imagine how\nthat has to refer to a candidate, so I think you come\nwithin both safe harbors that are available to\ncorporations. They could do it through a separate\nsegregated fund, but again, if what a corporation\nwants to do is correct some nasty publication that's\nbeen running some media corporation, they are\nperfectly free to do that with treasury funds and\nit's, it's harder for me to imagine how that would be\ntranslated into the context of a candidate election.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, Austin aside, do\nyou know of any case of ours that says that the\npress, quote, has greater First Amendment rights than\nJoe Mimeograph Machine?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't. I know there are\ncases that address --\nQUESTION: There are none.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right.\nQUESTION: There are none. In fact, we've\nsaid just the opposite.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, this Court has talked\nin various cases, Mills against Alabama is one, about\nthe freedom of the press, and suggesting maybe that\nadds something, but I don't think there is a case\nthat draws that definitive distinction, but again,\nthis is a little bit different. This is not saying\nthat the Freedom of the Press Clause, although that\nhas been raised in this litigation obliquely, that\nthe Freedom of Press Clause is what makes the\ndifference. What makes the difference here is a\nlegitimate decision by Congress to treat these\ndifferent corporations differently, and again, I know\nyou don't want to hear me say it, but the Austin\nCourt heard the argument, it said that that argument\nis invalid. And I don't think --\nQUESTION: I think they want to know why.\nAnd I suppose that what we are talking about is that\nthe Times or any radio station runs an editorial\nsaying, vote for Smith, or Jones is against labor,\nfor example, but if a union or corporation runs --\npays for the ad on the next page it falls right\nwithin the ad. I thought that the reason had to do\nwith the traditional role of the newspaper where we\nexpect them to have reporters, some of whom will in\nfact think one thing and some will think another and\nthe editorials may or may not make sense, but there\nare considerable implications for regulating those\nthat don't exist when we talk about Philip Morris or\nthe municipal workers union.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, I think that's exactly\nright. It reflects that historical tradition. It\nalso reflects the reality that applying this kind of\nlimitation to the press would make it very difficult\nfor them to report anything.\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't it go further\nthan that? I mean, if, if the argument that the\npress should be subject to the same limitations and\npresumably have the same powers, then the press would\nhave to publish a separate newspaper through a PAC in\norder to make the otherwise limited expression during\nthe 30-day period. I mean, that can't be done.\nMR. CLEMENT: No. That can't be done, and\nin --\nQUESTION: That wasn't the argument, that\nthe press has to be subject to these limitations.\nThe argument is, since these limitations would\nobviously be bad as applied to the press, they are\nbad as applied to everybody else, because everybody\nelse has the same rights as the press. I don't know\nwhy, why should it be that the corporation of great\nwealth -- let me put the question this way. Could,\ncould Congress pass a law saying, we are concerned\nabout the influence of major media corporations,\nMr. Murdoch? We are going to pass a law that no\ncorporation can own more than two national\nnewspapers. Would that law be valid?\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm sure that law would be\nchallenged. There might be a defense that you could\ntry to make on the law, but the point I'd like to\nmake is that I think that this effort is just another\neffort to say that Congress is powerless in this\nfield, because all the problems you are raising about\nelectioneering communication and how you treat the\npress differently apply a fortiori I to express\nadvocacy.\nQUESTION: You mean, you mean, you think\nI'm saying that Congress shall make no law\nrespecting, abridging the freedom of speech?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think --\nQUESTION: That is what I'm saying.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think what you are saying\nis that contrary to this Court's decisions in Austin,\nin MCFL, in all the corporate, in all the cases\ndealing with contributions, that the First Amendment\nholds the Congress powerless to deal with this\nproblem. And that is what this Court's cases say.\nQUESTION: Haven't we held that --\nQUESTION: Do you find it unusual that the\nCongress is powerless to favor one speaker over\nanother? Is that such an astounding proposition?\nMR. CLEMENT: No. What would be an\nastounding proposition is in light of the 100-year\ntradition of Congress' ability to regulate the\ninfluence of corporate political activity and\ncorporate influence on political elections if all\nthey can do is limit express advocacy or as I\nunderstand some members of this Court, they can't\neven do that. That is a very difficult position to\nswallow because Congress has been active in this\nfield since 1907. The abuses that they are\naddressing today are not different in kind from the\nabuses they have addressed for the past 100 years,\nand I simply don't think that they are powerless to\ndeal with this situation.\nQUESTION: Haven't we held that licensees\ncan be, radio licensees and television can be\ncompelled to give equal time to opposing points of\nview but you can't compel the newspapers to do that?\nMR. CLEMENT: No. That's a very good\npoint, and there are differences with respect to\nbroadcast media, and I think if I can digress for a\nminute to talk about some of the other provisions\nlike Section 305, 311, and 504 --\nQUESTION: You say there are differences\nwith respect to the broadcast media. You are not\nrelying on the scarcity of wavelengths, are you?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think with respect\nto some of the other provisions, 504, 307, I'm sorry,\n305 and 311, I do think that this Court's cases\nsuggesting that broadcast media are subjected to a\ndifferent regulatory regime remain good law, and I\nthink that there is certainly enough in this case\nwithout trying to revisit Red Lion or some of these\nother cases.\nhappen in this case and one of the unfortunate by\nproducts of the en masse nature of the way this case\nis litigated is that you look at some of the\nprovisions that are dealing with a very different\ntype of speech, and then you get to Section 504 and\nyou take a look at the broad terms that Congress has\nused and it's easy to reach the conclusion that\nthat's an impermissible approach and those words are\ntoo broad, but that ignores the reality of the way\nthe broadcast industry has been regulated.\nThat's, after all, an industry that\ncontinues to be regulated on a public interest\nstandard. In CBS against FCC, this Court upheld a\nstatute that required individual stations to give\nreasonable time to candidates and it's within that\nbackground that a provision, the kind of provisions\nthat Congress added to Section 504 are not --\nQUESTION: Was that the scarcity\nrationale?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think in the CBS\ncase that the court specifically addressed the\nscarcity rationale. It may well have been building\non prior precedents, though, that were based on that.\nOne other point I'd --\nQUESTION:\nabout regulating the broadcast media. That's the\nwhole point. They are the only people here who\naren't regulated. It's people who are trying to get\ntheir views across through these media who are\nregulated. It's not the media who are regulated.\nMR. CLEMENT: But that's the way that the\nmedia has long been regulated, which is to say that\nwith respect to requests for candidate advertisement,\nwith requests to address a, quote, controversial\nissue of public importance, which is the pre-existing\nlaw, nothing added by BCRA, there has been a\nrequirement that if you make a request for air time,\nthat the station do some record-keeping in\nconjunction with that and that's exactly what 504\ncarries over.\nQUESTION: Why -- why did they ask for\nrecord of requests as opposed to actual broadcast\ndeals?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think one of the reasons,\nJustice O'Connor, is so that they could enforce the\npublic interest standard, which has, which has\nmanifested itself not only in the fairness doctrine,\nbut also with the idea that stations have to give\nappropriate amounts of time to things like discussion\nof legislative issues.\nrequests before you, you can then make a judgment as\nto whether or not one station is denying all the\nrequests.\nQUESTION: Must the disclosure be made\nbefore the ads are run? It's not clear.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, it depends on which\nprovision that you are asking about, Justice --\nQUESTION: I'm talking about 504.\nMR. CLEMENT: In 504, what triggers the\ndisclosure, the disclosure requirements is, is a\nrequest and again --\nQUESTION: Yes, I know. But I'm asking\nabout the time within which it has to be disclosed by\nthe broadcast stations.\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm not positive about this.\nI don't think that Section 504 has that kind of\nadvance notice principle to it. The advance notice\nobjections that have been raised have been raised to\nSections 201 and 214, and I think with respect to\nthose provisions, it's important and worthwhile to\nnote that the FC -- the FEC has cured the advance\nnotice issue by regulation, and what people seem to\nhave focused on is the idea that the statute requires\nthe disclosure of a contract to disburse, and that\nlanguage is not designed to get at advanced\ndisclosure in the sense of advanced disclosure before\nthe ad airs. It's simply to get away with, to avoid\nthe clear circumvention that would happen if somebody\ncould buy ads on credit and then only disclose them\nafter the fact, after the election when they had\nactually made the disbursement at that point. I\nthink --\nQUESTION: But that, that same objective\ncould be obtained simply by requiring disclosure by\nthe station as soon as they, as soon as they run, I\nmean, file a report on the day that the ad runs.\nMR. CLEMENT: I mean, I think that's\nright, but again, that is the way that the FEC has\ninterpreted the provisions, which is to say there is\nno advance disclosure requirement under 201 and 214\nas interpreted by the FEC, because they trigger to\nthe definition of, for example, in 201 the\nelectioneering communication and you don't even know\nfor sure that it's an electioneering communication\nuntil it's in fact it is run in the relevant district\nthat's been targeted and all the like, so in that\nsense I do think that the FEC has cured any problem\nwith advance notice.\nI'm not sure it was that much of a problem\nin any event because what you are talking about is\nforcing people to disclose the fact that they made\nbinding contracts. I think it's also --\nQUESTION: What happens to the language,\nor contracts to make?\nMR. CLEMENT: Again --\nQUESTION: The regulation just reads that\nout of existence?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, again, what contracts to\nmakes disbursement, or I don't know what language you\nhave in front of you, but contracts to make\ndisbursement.\nQUESTION: It's in 202. Any person, if\nany person makes or contracts to make any\ndisbursement for an electioneering communication.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, as I was explaining\nto Justice O'Connor, that provision is necessary to\navoid the phenomenon where somebody contracts to make\na disbursement, i.e., buys an ad on credit and\ndoesn't make the disbursement until after the ad is\nrun or in fact after the election, so that's why\nthat's in there. It's also worth noting that the\nstatute --\nQUESTION: But it goes on to say, such\ndisbursement or contracting shall be treated as a\ncontribution and as an expenditure. Such\ndisbursement or contracting, so I assume the\ncontracting immediately falls --\nMR. CLEMENT: No, it doesn't fall within\nthe con -- the disclosure provision. I suppose if\nyou buy $10,000 worth of ads on credit that does\nbecome an expenditure the second you make that credit\npurchase, but I don't think that renders a statute\nunconstitutional. I think again it bears noting that\nthis advance sort of contract to purchase language\nhas been in the statute all along. It was in FECA\nwith respect to expenditures. In fact, I believe\nthat Justice Souter made note of that in footnote\none.\nQUESTION: To challenged and upheld. I\nmean, there's so much that was in FECA, and there's\nso much more that's in this that hasn't been\nchallenged here. I mean, simply to say it's been\naround for 30 years doesn't, doesn't convince me that\nit's valid.\nMR. CLEMENT: It depends on the nature of\nthe challenge with respect, Justice Scalia. If the\nnature of the challenge that a provision is vague and\nin fact a very similar provision has been in the\nstatute for 20 years and the regulated parties\nworking with the FEC in the context of 504 have\nfigured out how to live with it in a way that doesn't\nhave any chilling effects, then I think the fact that\nthere was a statutory prerequisite for it is quite\nimportant and is valid and a valid basis for\ninterpreting the statute.\nIf I may say in closing as I said before,\nI think the counsel of the other side in this case is\nthat, to borrow Justice Scalia's phrase, this problem\nis insoluble. They fully admit that the express\nadvocacy test doesn't work. I think it is not a\nproxy for speech designed to influence candidate\nelections. I think one thing we can trust candidates\nto do is to make speeches that are designed to\ninfluence their own elections, yet almost 90 percent\nof candidates' own advertisements don't use words of\nexpress advocacy.\nThe remarkable thing about plaintiffs here\nis that in the first, in the first, this morning we\nheard a little bit from Mr. Starr about less\nrestrictive alternatives. You hear not one word\nabout that this afternoon because they offer nothing\nas an alternative. They say it's express advocacy or\nnothing, and they are all too willing to abandon even\nexpress advocacy and I simply do not think that the\nConstitution leaves Congress powerless to deal with\nthis problem. Strict scrutiny is not a formula for\ncorruption. When Congress is dealing with this kind\nof corporate spending, a problem they have been\nwrestling with since 1907, they can take reasonable\nsteps like Title II to address the problem. If there\nare no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement. We'll\nhear from you, Mr. Waxman.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF INTERVENOR-DEFENDANTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nBuckley v. Valeo taught not that the\nso-called magic words test was a constitutional\nimmutable. It taught two lessons that are much more\nenduring, that are profound, and that demonstrate\njust exactly why the electioneering communications\ndefinition and provision is constitutional. The\nfirst thing that Buckley taught in this area is that\nstatutory requirements that cut right through core\npolitical speech, nothing more core than vote for\nBush or Bush is a good guy the day before the\nelection.\nStatutory requirements in this area must\nbe clear, they must be illusive so that they will\nnot, as this Court said, quote, dissolve impractical\napplication. No doubt about this case. No one on\nthe other side has suggested that there is any lack\nof clarity in this objective test. The second test,\nthe second factor that this Court articulated in --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I don't want --\nbecause this is important. No one has said,\nsuggested that what is less than clear?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry, the four-part\nprimary definition, that is, it has to be at 60 days\nbefore, targeted at the electorate, a specifically\nidentified candidate in an ad that is broadcast as\nopposed to an ad that runs in a newspaper.\nQUESTION: I thought there was\nsubstantial suggestion that clearly identified\ncandidate is not clear. It is not at all clear to\nme.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the FEC took comments\non whether or not it covered, for example, the\nMcCain-Feingold regulation or Roth IRA. And it has\nruled. It considered whether or not an ad that is\nrun within the period but says call your Congressman\nand has the Congressman's name without identifying\nhim by name is covered, and it ruled that it did.\nNow, those applications -- one of those\napplications, that is, the call your Congressman, my\nclients, the sponsor of this bill, urged the Court to\nthe urge the FEC to adopt. It didn't because it\nfound that there were possibilities for circumvention\nand not an established record to demonstrate that it\nwould cause a problem in any number of cases.\nQUESTION: You clarified that. I didn't\nmean to throw you off.\nMR. WAXMAN: The second test, the lesson\nthat Buckley teaches that is enduring is that\nstandards in this area must be, quote, directed\nprecisely to that spending that is unambiguously\nrelated to the campaign of a particular Federal\ncandidate.\nAnd so many we are talking about whether\nor not this law is overbroad or substantially\noverbroad, I suggest that the Court look to the\nstandard that it articulated itself in Buckley, which\nis are these expenditures for communications that are\nunambiguously campaign related. And if the answer is\nyes, in the vast majority of cases, then on its face,\nthe statute deserves to stand. There may be\nparticular applications that may be in fact\nunconstitutional. The FEC can issue rules,\nas-applied challenges --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you, what did the\ndistrict court do in this case? Didn't they strike\ndown the primary definition?\nMR. WAXMAN: The district court struck\ndown the primary definition and upheld an altered\nversion of the backup definition, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd it did so, based on its understanding and it was\na misunderstanding of what the data showed with\nrespect to the answer that was given to, I think it's\nquestion 6 in the Buying Time study. That is, our\ndata that showed that for one of the two years\ninvolved, 14.7 percent of the ads, which constituted\na total of six ads, were issue-related, not\ncandidate-related.\nQUESTION: This is the binary choice.\nQUESTION: Didn't the district court\npretty well disbelieve the Buying Time study?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, Mr. Chief Justice. In\nfact, Judge Leon, who was the swing vote, so to\nspeak, specifically found that although there had\nbeen some criticisms with respect to the methodology\nwith respect to this one question, he specifically\nfound that the Buying Time study was credible, and\nthat the results should be given credence.\nAnd it was on the basis of his\ninterpretation of the answer to that one question\nthat he determined that, well, this is 14.7 percent\nor 17 percent and that's overbroad. And what I would\nlike to address myself to is why -- first of all,\nthat analysis was incorrect. But more to the point,\neven if there never had been a Buying Time study,\neven if this question was never asked, Congress had\nmore than ample justification for doing this.\nOne of the wonderful things about a bright\nline objective test is it invites hypotheticals. But\nwhat Congress had before it, which is in strict\nscrutiny, after all, what we're addressing ourselves\nto, was the real world. And it had before it -- this\nis Defense Exhibit 48 in the record below -- the\nstory boards of all of the ads that were captured by\nthe CMAG database. That is, in the 75 largest media\nmarkets in the 11 months that led up to the 1998\ncampaign and the 2000 campaign.\nAnd we urge the Court to look through this\nvolume because the real world of what these ads were\ndoes not reflect the hypothetical instances in which\na corporation or a labor union is faced with an\nimminent piece of legislation that's going to be\nenacted the week before or the week after an election\nand it's only about changing votes.\nThere may very well be instances, if that\noccurs, in which an as-applied challenge can be made\nand a court can determine whether or not the law can\nconstitutionally be applied to that. But what is an\namazing feature about this case is the remarkable\ndegree to which the four-part objective test that\nCongress drew actually hits the observed reality of\nwhat Congress knew these ads were about.\nAt page 11A of the appendix to our brief,\nwe've reprinted a chart that is also contained in\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly's findings at special appendix\npage 848. And what the chart shows is a graph that\nshows, over the course of, I believe it's 2000. This\nwas 2000. Yes. Weeks prior to the 2000 election.\nIf you look at the dotted line which sort\nof waves back and forth very close to the bottom\naxis, those are the number of ads, issue ads, run\nduring 2000 that don't mention candidates. It stays\nvery constant throughout the year.\nIf you look at the hard line, you'll see\nan enormous spike that comes right about week 9, nine\nweeks before. That's 63 days before the election.\nAnd what Congress found was that there was\nsubstantial evidence, both the ads themselves and\nthrough objective data that I'm now going to\ndescribe, that what common sense leads you to\nbelieve, that is, that ads that run just before an\nelection, that mention a candidate that are targeted\nat that candidate's election, and that use broadcast\nmedia, that is the most expensive kind of media\npossible, are very likely intended to have, and\noverwhelmingly likely will have, an effect on an\nelection.\nNow, Justice Scalia, you're quite right.\nYou know, the hip bone is connected to the thigh bone\nwhich is connected to the knee bone, and that doesn't\nmean you can regulate the metatarsals. But we're\ntalking about a -- what a terrible metaphor.\nWe're talking about a test here that --\nwe're talking the test is spending that is\nunambiguously related to a campaign. And what\nCongress found, based on the ads, is that that was\nthe case. And if you don't want to read through all\nof these direct ads, just look at the ones that the\nPlaintiffs have attached to their brief.\nQUESTION: The Congress found that these\nads made them feel very bad, and we would not accept\nthat they criticized the incumbents. We wouldn't\naccept that rationale from a city council. Why\nshould we do it from the Congress?\nMR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. And that is\nnot the reason that -- there is a lot of talk about\nattack ads. But the reality is they didn't ban\nattack ads and they didn't even ban attack ads by\ncorporations and labor unions and nonprofits.\nQUESTION: But you're saying that was not\nany part of the rationale for the enactment of a\nlegislation?\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. There were\nindividual statements by members of Congress who were\nupset about this. But if you look at the test that\nCongress crafted, and the fact -- and it is in the\nrecord in this case that the vast majority of these\nads were attacking not incumbents. The vast majority\nof these ads were attacking challengers. I don't\nthink it's fair --\nQUESTION: Why do you say they haven't\nbanned attack ads? It's very hard to devise a good\npunchy attack ad that doesn't name the person you're\nattacking.\nMR. WAXMAN: There is no doubt about the\nfact that these ads -- there are ads here that both\nattack and praise.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. WAXMAN: My point to Justice Kennedy\nwas, by and large, the incumbents made out very well\nunder the status quo ante. And it is -- Justice\nScalia --\nQUESTION: If the price of getting rid of\nthe attack ads is that I have to ban some of the\npraising ads as well, it's worth it.\nMR. WAXMAN: The purpose of the\nlegislation, and it is manifest, we included it in an\nappendix in our brief, and it's in the Thompson\ncommittee report and the page is cited by Senator\nThompson's amicus brief, is that Congress was closing\na loophole. It was closing a loophole that the\npolitical director of the National Rifle Association\ncalled a line in the land drawn on a windy day.\nShe said that the express advocacy test\nwas a wall built of the same sturdy material as the\nemperor's clothing. Everyone sees it. No one\nbelieves it. It was, in other words, serving the\nparamount interest in reducing a provision of law, a\nprovision of law enacted by Congress following this\nCourt's decision in Buckley that had made the law an\nobject of scorn.\nAnd that is all over the record in this\ncase. That what this was about was replacing a line\nin the sand drawn on a windy day with a line that\neverybody can see and that no one would miss. And\nthe evidence before Congress was not just this\nquestion 6, but the ads themselves, the way they ran.\nThere are statement after statement after statement\nfrom witnesses in this case that are included in the\nJoint Appendix. And objective studies from -- the\nobjective data from the Buying Time studies, the\nAnnenberg Center, Professor Magleby at Brigham Young\nUniversity.\nAnd the internal documents -- and we have\nsome of these discussed in our brief -- the internal\ndocuments of the corporations and unions that ran\nthese ads. They have documents that showed that they\nwere aiming at voters, they were using consultants\nand pollsters to try and figure out how to get\nvoters. They tested these against voters.\nThese were electioneering in every sense\nof the word. And here is -- just to put some\nreality, I guess, the real world example behind that\nchart, number 11A. Citizens for Better Medicare was\nan organization that ran a large number of these ads\nin 2000. Described itself as -- its official Web\nsite as a group of concerned seniors and companies\nand associations concerned about Medicare.\nIt was in fact funded almost exclusively\nby Pharma and the corporations that make up Pharma.\nNothing wrong with them running issue ads at all,\nJustice Scalia. From January 1 until September 4,\nthat is, until the 60-day period cut in, they ran\n23,867 issue ads about Medicare and not a single one\nmentioned a candidate.\nOn September 4, until election day, they\nran 10,876 ads all mentioning candidates. And on\nelection day, they stopped cold. And in our brief,\nwe discuss this at page 50 and 52. That is a\nparticularly striking example of no requirement to\ndisclose to the public who's paying for this when it\nis, in fact, corporate treasuries.\nQUESTION: That disclosure thing is a\ndifferent problem, but why banning it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, again, Justice\nScalia\nQUESTION: You've raised the risk of\ncorruption or the appearance of corruption, the fact\nthat they -- I mean, I agree with you that they named\ncandidates. What is wrong, so long as you disclose\nwho it is, that's a different issue. But so long as\nyou disclose who's doing it, what is wrong with their\nnaming a candidate?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- Justice Scalia,\nI'm right here with my brother, Clement, with Austin.\nAnd with the very same rationale that this Court\nadopted in Austin, which was explicated in the Auto\nWorkers case by Justice Frankfurter, which was\nrecited again by a unanimous opinion of the Court in\nNational Right to Work Committee.\nThe issue here is whether or not, when\nwe're talking about campaign-related speech, when we\nare talking about who gets to speak when individual\ncitizens are exercising their constitutional\nfranchise to vote, the question is whether\ncorporations and labor unions have to do it the same\nway all the rest of us do.\nQUESTION: What about the --\nMR. WAXMAN: With voluntary funds\ncontributed by individuals for that very purpose.\nAnd the PAC issue that has been discussed -- you\nprobably have heard more than you want to hear about\nthis law in any event, and certainly about the PACs.\nBut the PAC issue that I want to address and the\nmedia exemption.\nOn PACs, we've heard about that the labor\nunions and how hard it is for the AFL-CIO and what\nevidence there is in the record. Okay, in the 2000\nelection cycle, labor unions contributed $53 million\nfrom their PACs in contributions and expenditures.\nAnd that's not including the treasury funds that they\nuse to run the kind of electioneering ads that are\nincluded in our submission.\nI guess the other two organizations that\nwere named were the National Rifle Association and\nthe ACLU. The National Rifle Association had so much\nextra money left in its PAC in the last election\ncycle that it ended up spending millions of dollars\non things that it wasn't even required to use PAC\nmoney for. It has 4 million members. If each of\nthose 4 million members gives $10 a year, they will\nhave one of the biggest -- probably the biggest PAC\nin history, $40 million.\nAnd there is no showing whatsoever --\nthey've just raised their dues from $25 to $35. If\nthey just say the dues are still $25. But if you\nbelieve with us that political advocacy in this case\nand talking to candidates and voters who are voting\nthe candidates about how precious the Second\nAmendment is, please give us $10. If and when a day\ncomes when they can't fund their advocacy in this\nnarrow window, with respect to broadcast ads targeted\nat particular races, the courts will be open to them.\nThis Court has announced an exception to\nthe PAC requirement in MCFL, and the courts are\navailable to any corporation that wants to -- or\nlabor union that wants to come in and say we don't --\nQUESTION: But is that the way that we\nwould ordinarily construe a statute. To say, you\nknow, if this bothers you or affects you, come in and\nwe'll make an exception for you? That's usually the\nlegislative prerogative.\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbut in MCFL itself, for example, we have an\nas-applied exemption made by the Court in order to\nsatisfy constitutional concerns. And our only\nsubmission is that on its face, this is in an area in\nwhich the need for legislation is compelling, but the\ndrafting challenges are daunting. This effort by\nCongress at least deserves a chance to protect\nitself.\nNow, just to clarify --\nQUESTION: It's getting it now.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it should have the\nopportunity to prove that the parade of horribles\nthat our opponents, the type of hypotheticals, we\nwon't be able to fund a PAC, or we want to run --\nQUESTION: Congress chose this course.\nCongress said a three judge district court\nimmediately appealed to the Supreme Court, and 22\nissues. I mean, it's not our fault.\nMR. WAXMAN: How well I know. But in all\nseriousness, Mr. Chief Justice, I will be one of the\nhappiest people on the face of the planet when I sit\ndown today, however you decide.\nBut we're talking about a facial\nchallenge, a facial challenge. And the express\nadvocacy test, the contribution limits and\nexpenditure limits were not declared unconstitutional\non their face when this Court found in MCFL that were\nsome PAC burdens for some types of corporations that\nthe First Amendment should not require to be borne.\nNow, with respect to the media exception,\nI think there may be a misunderstanding about what\nthis exception actually says. It's not an exception\nfor General Electric or people who own medias. It's\non page 29A of the government's jurisdictional\nstatement. It accepts a communication appearing in a\nnews story, commentary or editorial distributed\nthrough the facilities of any broadcasting station.\nIt's not an exception for General Electric or even\nthe company that owns a broadcast --\nQUESTION: Only for the subsidiary of\nGeneral Electric, right?\nMR. WAXMAN: To the contrary. Anybody who\nwants to run an issue ad, General Electric can run it\nand it's going to have to run it through its PAC,\njust like anything else.\nQUESTION: But NBC can say whatever it\nwants, right?\nMR. WAXMAN: NBC on its editorial or news\nstory can say whatever it wants.\nQUESTION: What else is there, besides --\nI mean, it's going to be in a sit come?\nMR. WAXMAN: May I answer? Thank you.\nWhen Congress finds what there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to suggest exists, that companies that own\nbroadcasting stations are misusing that privilege,\nCongress can and will address it. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
